Closing of the meetingInformation about proposals relating to Agenda itemsInformation about proposals related to Agenda item 2It is proposed that Johan Thiman (White & Case)  or anyone he appoints in his stead  be elected Chairman of the Meeting.Information about proposals related to Agenda item 7Amendment to the Company's Articles of Association to include squeeze-out rights for an offerorThe Board of Directors has already submitted this proposal for the consideration of the Extraordinary General Meeting of the Company which was held on 16 February 2024 (the ""Previous EGM"").At the Previous EGM  42.16 percent in nominal value of the total shares/SDRs in issue were represented at the meeting and 99.97 percent of the shares/SDRs represented (42.14 percent of the total shares/SDRs in issue) voted in favor of the Board of Directors' proposal. In accordance with Article 135 of the Companies Act (Cap. 386 of the Laws of Malta) the adoption of the resolution required approval by not less than 75 percent of the nominal value of the shares/SDRs represented and entitled to vote at the meeting and at least 51 percent of the nominal value of the total shares/SDRs in issue and entitled to vote at the meeting. As these requirements were not met  the Board of Directors has convened an extraordinary general meeting to take a fresh vote on this proposal in accordance with the rules set out in Article 135(1)(b) of the Companies Act (Cap. 386 of the Laws of Malta).At this EGM the resolution may be passed by shareholder/holder of SDRs having the right to attend and vote at the meeting holding in the aggregate not less than 75 percent in nominal value of the shares/SDRs represented and entitled to vote at the meeting. However  if more than half in nominal value of all the shares/SDRs having the right to vote at the meeting is represented at that meeting  a simple majority in nominal value of such shares/SDRs so represented shall suffice for the adoption of the resolution.The Board of Directors refers to the statement of the Board of Directors of the Company in relation to the public tender offer by La Française des Jeux SA (""FDJ"")  which offer was made by FDJ on 22 January 2024 to the holders of SDRs in the Company to tender all their SDRs in the Company to FDJ for a cash consideration (the ""Offer""). Completion of the Offer is subject to a number of conditions  one of which is that the Company's Articles of Association be amended prior to the end of the acceptance period of the Offer  to allow for an owner of shares  representing not less than 90 percent of the outstanding capital of the Company carrying voting rights  to require all the other shareholders of the Company to transfer all of their shares in the Company to the owner.If this resolution proposed to be adopted by the EGM is adopted  the Company is required to amend and update its Memorandum and Articles of Association in line with article 79 of the Companies Act (Chapter 386 of the Laws of Malta).Accordingly and in order to fulfil that condition  the EGM will consider and  if thought fit  adopt the following Extraordinary Resolution:""That the current Memorandum and Articles of Association of the Company be replaced in their entirety by the new Memorandum and Articles of Association (a copy of which was made available to shareholders at the registered office of the Company  at the Company's office in Sweden and on the Company's website since the dispatch of the notice convening this meeting).""Explanatory NoteThe main proposed change to the Articles of Association relates to the inclusion of a new Article 34B  in order to provide for squeeze-out rights for an offeror.

The Remuneration report is available on the company's website  www.skf.com.Proposal under item 17The main contents of the Board of Directors' proposal are stated below. The complete proposal is available at the company and at the company's website  www.skf.com.At the Annual General Meeting in 2008 the SKF Group introduced a long-term performance share programme for senior managers and key employees. Since then  the Annual General Meeting has resolved each year upon a performance share programme.The Board proposes - in order to continue to link the long-term interests of the participants and the shareholders  strengthening the SKF Group's ability to attract and retain the best people and to contribute to the SKF Group's business strategy  its long-term interests and sustainability - that a decision be taken at the Annual General Meeting 2024 on SKF's Performance Share Programme 2024.The programme is proposed to cover senior managers and key employees in the SKF Group with an opportunity to be allotted  free of charge  SKF B shares in accordance with the following principal terms and guidelines. Under the programme  not more than in total 1 000 000 SKF B shares may be allotted.The allotment of shares shall be related to the level of achievement of the Total Value Added (TVA) target  as defined by the Board  and SKF's CDP Climate Change score target. The TVA performance measure is weighted 80% and the CDP Climate Change score performance measure is weighted 20%.TVA performance measureTVA is a simplified  economic value-added model promoting greater operating profit  capital efficiency and profitable growth. TVA is the operating profit  less the pre-tax cost of capital.Over the three-year programme period (2024-2026)  the TVA performance target range is set annually by the Board against the baseline of the actual TVA achieved in the previous year. The overall performance achievement for the TVA performance measure of the programme is the average of achievements of the annual TVA targets. In order for allocation of shares to take place  the average TVA development must exceed a certain minimum level (the threshold level). In addition to the threshold level  a target level is set. Maximum allotment is awarded if the target level is reached or exceeded. By way of example  if the TVA achievement year 1 is 80%  year 2 is 100% and year 3 is 0%  the overall performance achievement of the programme would then be 60% (80%+100%+0% / 3).CDP Climate Change score performance measureCDP is a global non-profit organization known for its assessments and scoring methodology to evaluate companies' disclosure and performance relating to climate change and environmental impact. The CDP Climate Change score is based on an extensive questionnaire requiring disclosure and performance in the following categories: Business strategy  Financial planning & scenario analysis  Emissions reduction initiatives  Energy  Governance  Opportunity disclosure  Risk disclosure  Risk management processes  Scope 1 & 2 emissions  Scope 3 emissions  Targets and Value chain engagement.This comprehensive assessment and the resulting score is known across the investor and customer communities as a credible third-party view on companies' approaches to climate change. The score ranges from A (leadership level) to D- (disclosure level). SKF received an A in 2023 which is in the leadership band. This is higher than the Europe regional average of B  and higher than the metal product manufacturing sector average of C. The score is set annually and the bar is raised every year  reflecting increasing stakeholder expectations. SKF's performance achievement and CDP score will therefore require continuous improvements.The overall performance achievement for the CDP Climate Change score is the weighted average of the annual performance achievement  based on the following criteria:SKF's CDP Climate Change score Performance achievement A 100 % A- 75 % B 50 % <B 0 %For example  if SKF's CDP score is B year 1  A- year 2 and A year 3  the overall performance achievement for the full programme period is 75% (50%+75%+100% / 3).Provided that the performance measures of the programme are fully met  the participants of the programme may be allotted up to the following maximum number of shares per person within the various key groups:CEO and President -shares corresponding to a value of 75% of the fixed base salary-shares corresponding to a value of 75% of the fixed base salary Other members of Group Management - shares corresponding to 55% of the fixed base salary or 13 000 shares  whichever is higher- shares corresponding to 55% of the fixed base salary or 13 000 shares  whichever is higher Managers of large business units and similar - 4 500 shares- 4 500 shares Other senior managers - 3 000 shares- 3 000 shares Other key persons - 1 250 sharesIf the total outcome of the programme exceeds the threshold level for allotment of shares but the final allotment is below 5% of the target level  payment will be made in cash instead of shares  whereupon the amount of the cash payment shall correspond to the value of the shares calculated on the basis of the closing price for SKF's B share the day before settlement.If all the conditions included in SKF's Performance Share Programme 2024 are met  allotment of shares shall be made free of charge following the expiry of the three-year calculation period  i.e. during 2027.Before the number of shares to be allotted is finally determined  the Board shall examine whether the allotment is reasonable considering SKF's financial results and position  the conditions on the stock market as well as other circumstances  and if not  as determined by the Board  reduce the number of shares to be awarded to the lower number of shares deemed appropriate by the Board.The Board is furthermore entitled to introduce an alternative incentive solution for employees in countries where participation in SKF's Performance Share Programme 2024 is not appropriate. Such alternative incentive solution shall  as far as practicable  be formulated employing the same conditions as SKF's Performance Share Programme 2024.The company has 455 351 068 shares in issue when this notice is issued. In order to comply with the obligations of SKF's Performance Share Programme 2024  a maximum number of 1 000 000 B shares are required  corresponding to approximately 0.2% of the total number of outstanding shares.Assuming maximum allocation under the Performance Share Programme 2024 and a share price of SEK 210  the cost  including social security cost  is estimated at approximately MSEK 252. On the basis of a share price of SEK 290 the cost  including social security cost  is estimated at approximately MSEK 348. In addition  the administrative costs are estimated at approximately MSEK 2.The Board does not propose for the time being to take any action to hedge SKF's obligations under the programme. Delivery of shares under the programme shall not take place until 2027.Number of shares and votes  and documentationWhen this notice is issued  the total number of shares in the company are 455 351 068  represented by 29 306 933 series A shares and 426 044 135 series B shares  with a total number of votes of 71 911 346.5.

Sprott  the sponsor of this product in the US  has seen its version gather around $400 million in assets in less than a year.McNeil explained the demand for this ETF is driven by a recognition of nuclear power's role in providing a consistent clean energy source and a supply squeeze exacerbated by the Russia-Ukraine conflict. URNM  HANetf's broader uranium miners product  was the top-performing thematic ETF in Europe last year with a 45% return.McNeil also highlighted the Future of Defence UCITS ETF (NATO)  which benefits from current geopolitical tensions. This ETF is unique as it includes companies affiliated with NATO members or affiliates  aiming to capitalize on increased defence spending commitments among NATO countries.Also under the spotlight was the ETC Group Physical Bitcoin ETF (BTCE)  the most traded crypto spot ETF in Europe  boasting $1.3 billion in assets.

Bruno Le Maire  Minister of Economy  Finance and Industrial and Digital Sovereignty,CARBIOS rallies players to promote textile circularity sector in the presence of M. Bruno Le Maire  Minister of Economy  Finance and Industrial and Digital SovereigntyClermont-Ferrand  France  19 February 2024 (06.45am CET) CARBIOS (Euronext Growth Paris: ALCRB)  a pioneer in the development and industrialization of biological technologies to reinvent the life cycle of plastic and textiles  was honored to welcome Mr. Bruno Le Maire  Minister of the Economy  Finance  Industrial and Digital Sovereignty  to its headquarters in Clermont-Ferrand where its industrial demonstrator is located. In the presence of industry players  local representatives  partners  and investors  through his visit  the Minister showed his support for CARBIOS and the creation of a textile recycling industry. The construction of France's first enzymatic PET biorecycling plant by CARBIOS marks a major step towards a circular economy for plastic and textiles. This innovation  which is currently being industrialized  demonstrates the extent to which the ecological transition can contribute to France’s green reindustrialization  and that the textile circular economy is a sector that creates environmental value  economic growth and employment.CARBIOS has developed a technology for recycling PET by enzymatic depolymerization that can be applied to polyester textiles. The industrial demonstrator co-financed by the EIB  with its own patented textile preparation line inaugurated in October 2023  will incorporate prepared textile waste into the CARBIOS process for large-scale recycling. The world's first biorecycling plant is currently under construction in Longlaville  Grand-Est Region of France.Bruno Le Maire  French Minister of the Economy  Finance  Industrial and Digital Sovereignty: “CARBIOS demonstrates that it is possible to combine ecological transition  Made In France and economic growth: an example of what entrepreneurial ambition  creative science and passionate men and women can achieve for the planet. I had the pleasure of visiting the CARBIOS industrial demonstrator in operation  which can recycle bottles  PET packaging and polyester textiles many times over – this is impressive. The next step is the CARBIOS plant in Longlaville (Meurthe-et-Moselle)  co-financed by the French government  to recycle 50 000 tons of waste a year  and then  other plants in France  Europe and the rest of the world  to meet the demands of consumers and brands committed to the environmental cause.”Philippe Pouletty  Founder of CARBIOS and Chairman of the Board: “We thank Bruno Le Maire for his visit  which honors us  and for the government's strong support for CARBIOS  particularly through France 2030. CARBIOS demonstrates that radical science and innovation can forge a constructive ecology to solve the planetary issue of plastic pollution. Recycling plastic with CARBIOS biotechnologies will also reduce our reliance on hydrocarbons  while preserving the rational use of plastics. The balanced synergy between our private investors  the State and European funding can enable CARBIOS to become a global leader.”Emmanuel Ladent  CEO of CARBIOS: “CARBIOS is the bridge between the world of biotech and the world of textiles: without technological solutions for recycling textiles  there cannot be a viable industry or real circularity. Thanks to the unfailing support of the French government  as Mr. Bruno Le Maire's visit bears witness  the industrialization of CARBIOS' biorecycling innovation is ready  with our first plant under construction in Longlaville. The textile recycling sector is being developed  and the other actors in the value chain (collection  sorting and preparation) will be ready too: this circular textile sector is in France  industrial and creating jobs to preserve the environment.”Key dates in the development of textile biorecycling2018 First textile depolymerization tests at laboratory scale 2021 First textile depolymerization tests at pilot scale 2022Production of biorecycled white fiber from colored fibers at pilot scale Carbios launches fiber-to-fiber consortium 2023PVH Corp.

The impact of high rates from the past year  together with the potential for lower rates this year  will likely lead to an increase in demand for auto loan refinances  he suggests.According to Yalich  while lending will always be subject to the vagaries of the financial markets  auto lenders are likely to handle a higher volume of loans this year: “The pent-up demand from consumers waiting to buy a new car will likely release this year  with consumers who bought when rates were higher looking to refinance as rates lower.” He notes that while the traditional practice of refinancing auto loans hasn’t been as popular in recent times  relatively low rates during the early 2020s led many lenders to offer auto loan refinancing.In any year in which loan volumes are higher  Yalich says it will be imperative for auto lenders to be on the lookout for mistakes and inconsistencies in data. A December 2023 Wolters Kluwer auto lending survey revealed that 77% of auto financiers who still rely on manual or paper processes acknowledge that their documents contain errors in a third or more of deals.“Auto lenders will start to use artificial intelligence to increase their touchpoints with customers and to detect mistakes and fraud ” said Yalich. “Those who have digitized will find it easier to manage the influx of customers and make sure that they are in contact with customers along their lending journey.”Respondents in that same Wolters Kluwer survey indicated they were looking to transition to digitized documents in the following areas: for loan processing and funding (31%); credit application and decisioning (28%); and securitization or collateralization (24%).“The industry has been focused on the consumer experience and making sure that it is digitized to match consumer buying habits ” explains Yalich. “What I believe we will see this year is an emphasis on prioritizing the back end of the lending process. This is a shift in the industry and a new point of focus that will minimize errors  create efficiencies  and keep pace with early adopters who prefer a fully digital lending experience.”Wolters Kluwer Compliance Solutions is a leading provider of digital technology and expert professional services.

The designation was granted based on results from the Phase II clinical trial  NIPU evaluating UV1 added to ipilimumab and nivolumab treatment in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma.“The EMA’s Orphan Drug Designation for UV1 in mesothelioma is an important step forward in the development of our cancer vaccine in this indication ” said Carlos de Sousa  CEO of Ultimovacs. “It allows for important regulatory and commercial benefits and provides us with the potential to rapidly advance UV1 for a patient population with poor prognosis and a high unmet medical need.”To qualify for orphan designation in the EU  an investigational medicine must be intended to treat a seriously debilitating or life-threatening condition affecting fewer than five in 10 000 people in the EU  based on data that support that the investigational medicine may produce clinically significant benefits over existing treatments. ODD provides companies with certain benefits and incentives  including ten years of market exclusivity upon reaching the market  clinical protocol assistance  access to a centralized marketing authorization procedure  and reduced regulatory fees.Mesothelioma is a rare and aggressive form of cancer with a high mortality rate and few therapeutic options. Patients with mesothelioma commonly have a history of occupational or environmental exposure to asbestos  and it typically takes decades for this specific form of cancer to develop.The impact of UV1 vaccination in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma has been evaluated in a randomized Phase II clinical trial  NIPU. In the study  UV1 was combined with checkpoint inhibitors ipilimumab and nivolumab and compared to ipilimumab and nivolumab alone as a second-line treatment  after first-line treatment with platinum-based chemotherapy. The results from the study  presented at the European Society for Molecular Oncology (“ESMO”) Congress 2023   demonstrated a clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival for UV1 treatment in combination with ipilimumab and nivolumab versus ipilimumab and nivolumab alone. In addition  UV1 maintained its positive safety and tolerability profile in this combination with no added toxicities. Oslo University Hospital sponsored the NIPU study with support from Bristol Myers Squibb and Ultimovacs.On February 5  2024   the FDA granted Fast Track designation for UV1 in combination with ipilimumab and nivolumab for the treatment of patients with unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma to improve overall survival. In October 2023   UV1 received Orphan Drug Designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients with mesothelioma. In December 2021   the FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation for UV1 for the treatment of stage IIB-stage IV melanoma. In October 2021   the FDA granted Fast Track designation for UV1 as add-on therapy to ipilimumab or pembrolizumab for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma.==ENDS==About NIPUNIPU ( N ivolumab and I pilimumab P lus/minus U V1 vaccination) is a randomized  multi-center phase II trial in which Ultimovacs’ universal cancer vaccine  UV1  is evaluated in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb’s checkpoint inhibitors  nivolumab and ipilimumab  as second-line treatment of malignant pleural mesothelioma. The trial sponsor is Oslo University Hospital  supported in the preparation and execution of the trial by Ultimovacs and Bristol Myers Squibb. The 118 patients are randomized 1:1 into two treatment arms. All participants receive treatment with nivolumab (240 mg every two weeks) and ipilimumab (1 mg/kg every six weeks) until disease progression  unacceptable toxicity  or for a maximum of 2 years. Patients randomized to the experimental arm received eight intradermal injections of UV1 vaccine during the first three months of treatment. The objective of the study is to achieve a clinically meaningful progression-free survival (PFS) benefit in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) after progression on first-line standard platinum doublet chemotherapy. Subsequent events emerging in patients in both arms of the NIPU study will continue to be monitored beyond the read-out of the primary endpoint. The ipilimumab and nivolumab combination has been approved as first-line treatment for patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma in Europe and the U.S.About MesotheliomaMesothelioma is a rare and aggressive type of cancer that occurs in the thin layer of tissue that surrounds the lungs and inside of the chest. Mesothelioma accounted for 30 870 new cancer cases and 26 278 cancer deaths worldwide in 2020  according to International Agency for Research on Cancer (Globocan 2020). Pleural mesothelioma is a disease with a high unmet medical need  especially in industrialized countries. The median overall survival is approximately one year. Occupational asbestos exposure is the No. 1 cause of the disease  and several occupations  like firefighters  military veterans  construction  and industry workers  are at risk. This cancer usually takes several decades to develop after a person’s first exposure to asbestos. Most patients are diagnosed after age 70 because of the long latency period. Even though the use of asbestos to a large extent is banned in many countries today  new incidences of mesothelioma will continue to be a medical and public health challenge because of the long latency period typical of the illness. For patients with inoperable disease  few treatment options are available after first-line chemotherapy. The combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab has recently shown increased survival compared to standard chemotherapy  but most patients do not respond  and improvements are called for. Telomerase is expressed in mesothelioma cells and is therefore a relevant target for therapeutic vaccination.About UltimovacsUltimovacs is a clinical-stage biotechnology leader in novel immunotherapeutic cancer vaccines with broad applicability. Ultimovacs’ lead candidate  UV1  is an off-the-shelf therapeutic cancer vaccine directed against human telomerase (hTERT)  an antigen that is present in 85-90% of cancers in all stages of tumor growth.

The investigator-initiated trial is led by Vestre Viken (Drammen Hospital) and supported by Ultimovacs.About UV1UV1 is an off-the-shelf therapeutic cancer vaccine designed to induce a specific T cell response against telomerase. UV1 consists of long  synthetic peptides representing a sequence in the reverse transcriptase subunit of telomerase (hTERT)  shown to induce CD4+ T cells. These CD4+ T cells have the potential to provide inflammatory signals and T cell support believed to be critical for triggering a strong anti-tumor immune response. Following intradermal injection  antigen presenting cells (APCs) in the skin are exposed to the vaccine peptides. These APCs will process the peptides  and present vaccine epitopes on Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) molecules to naïve T cells in the lymph nodes. Activated vaccine specific T cells will then enter the circulation and search for cells displaying their cognate antigen in the context of HLA molecules.The UV1 peptides contain several epitopes  shown to be non-restrictive in terms of (HLA) alleles for presentation. It is therefore not required to perform HLA pre-screening of patients  which potentially enables broad population utilization of the vaccine. UV1 is administered over three months as eight intradermal injections together with the immune-modulator GM-CSF.For further information  please see www.ultimovacs.com or contact:Carlos de Sousa  CEOEmail: carlos.desousa@ultimovacs.comPhone: +47 908 92507Anne Worsøe  Head of IREmail: anne.worsoe@ultimovacs.comPhone: +47 90686815This information is considered to be inside information pursuant to the EU Market Abuse Regulation and is subject to the disclosure requirements pursuant to Section 5-12 in the Norwegian Securities Trading Act.This stock exchange announcement was published by Anne Worsøe  Head of Investor Relations at Ultimovacs ASA  on February 19  2024 at 07:00 CET.,neutral,0.01,0.76,0.23,negative,0.04,0.4,0.56,True,English,"['EMA Orphan Drug Designation', 'UV1 Cancer Vaccine', 'Ultimovacs', 'Treatment', 'Mesothelioma', 'I pilimumab P lus/minus U V1 vaccination', 'randomized, multi-center phase II trial', 'randomized Phase II clinical trial', 'malignant stage IIB-stage IV melanoma', 'centralized marketing authorization procedure', 'novel immunotherapeutic cancer vaccines', 'The Orphan Drug Designation', 'unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma', 'U.S. Food', 'clinical protocol assistance', 'clinical-stage biotechnology leader', 'Carlos de Sousa', 'unmet medical need', 'five in 10,000 people', 'eight intradermal injections', 'first three months', 'Fast Track designation', 'European Medicines Agency', 'Bristol Myers Squibb', 'first-line standard platinum', 'Oslo University Hospital', 'high mortality rate', 'universal cancer vaccine', 'meaningful progression-free survival', 'Drug Administration ODD', 'orphan designation', 'UV1 vaccination', 'metastatic melanoma', 'trial sponsor', 'two treatment arms', 'European Society', 'Bristol-Myers Squibb', 'therapeutic options', 'meaningful improvement', 'The EMA', 'overall survival', 'OSE ULTI', 'positive opinion', 'important step', 'important regulatory', 'patient population', 'poor prognosis', 'investigational medicine', 'life-threatening condition', 'existing treatments', 'regulatory fees', 'aggressive form', 'environmental exposure', 'specific form', 'checkpoint inhibitors', 'first-line treatment', 'Molecular Oncology', 'positive safety', 'tolerability profile', 'N ivolumab', 'unacceptable toxicity', 'experimental arm', 'PFS) benefit', 'Subsequent events', 'primary endpoint', 'UV1 vaccine', 'commercial benefits', 'significant benefits', 'ten years', 'market exclusivity', 'second-line treatment', 'platinum-based chemotherapy', 'disease progression', 'Ultimovacs ASA', 'UV1 treatment', 'NIPU study', 'nivolumab treatment', '2 years', 'results', 'combination', 'ipilimumab', 'patients', 'company', 'application', 'development', 'indication', 'CEO', 'potential', 'debilitating', 'fewer', 'data', 'companies', 'incentives', 'access', 'rare', 'history', 'occupational', 'asbestos', 'decades', 'impact', 'ESMO', 'Congress', 'addition', 'added', 'toxicities', 'support', 'February', 'FDA', 'October', 'December', 'pembrolizumab', 'ENDS', 'preparation', 'execution', 'participants', 'maximum', 'objective', 'MPM']",2024-02-19,2024-02-20,marketscreener.com

Positive price and mix contribution through further innovation and trade-up  was partially offset by lower volumes in Developed Markets.In Europe  the geographical expansion in the Eastern countries  combined with BIC’s focus on its iconic products  such as 4-Colors  drove a mid-single-digit growth at constant currency. Net Sales were boosted by a new range of 4-Colors  Media Clic  and Super Clip. BIC gained market share in key countries such as France and the UK9  both online and offline  thanks to its value-for-money positioning which is increasingly relevant to consumers.In the US  net sales were driven by both core products (Correction Tape and Mechanical Pencil) as well as our Skin Creative segment (Inkbox semi-permanent tattoos and Bodymark tattoo marker)  in line with the Horizon strategy to grow in innovative segments.Despite a declining market  BIC remains a great value-for-money brand appealing to consumers and therefore maintained its market share notably boosted by Mechanical Pencil  Correction Tape  Highlighters  and Gel segments.

Several key regions contributed to growth  such as West Africa and South Africa  which was driven by a strong Back to School sell-in.FY 2023 Human Expression division adjusted EBIT margin was 7.2% versus 3.0% in FY 2022. The increase was driven by a favorable price/mix  lower raw material costs  brand support investments  and manufacturing efficiencies. This was partially offset by unfavorable currency fluctuations  mainly the US dollar/Mexican peso  unfavorable fixed cost absorption  and higher operating expenses.Q4 2023 Human Expression division adjusted EBIT margin improved from -5.1% to 0% versus prior year. This was driven by gross profit increase (favorable pricing and mix and lower cost of production including raw material and electricity) as well as lower brand support and operating expenses.

Volumes were negatively impacted by performance in the US but grew mid single digit versus pre-covid levels.In Europe  net sales grew high single digit driven by core lighter products and further distribution gains in Eastern Europe  as well as premium products such as Djeep and the EZ Reach launch  in line with our strategy to capture more flame occasions. The EZ Reach pocket utility lighter was launched into most major markets in Europe and accounted for almost 20% of total division’s growth versus last year.In the US  the total lighter market declined by 6.3% in volume and 2.8% in value11. However  BIC maintained its leadership position  gaining share in volume  +0.7 pts  and value  +1.3 pts boosted by the utility segment. Our EZ Reach lighter reached 5.8% of market share in value12  up +0.4 points thanks to strong distribution and in-store visibility in the Modern Mass market. In 2023  the US lighters business performance was negatively impacted by an unfavorable comparative basis in Q1 2023 as a result of negative phasing versus Q1 2022 (which benefited from delayed shipments following supply issues in Q4 2021) as well as competitive imports coming from Asia.In Latin America  Brazil net sales grew double digit driven by favorable price and mix  as well as increased distribution of decorated and utility lighters. The launch of the BIC EZ Reach utility pocket lighter in the fourth quarter was successful and contributed to net sales performance.In Middle East and Africa  net sale performance was driven by distribution expansion across the regions  notably Morrocco  Egypt and South Africa.FY 2023 Flame for Life division adjusted EBIT margin reached 34.1% versus 35.0% in FY 2022 driven by higher raw material costs  unfavorable fixed cost absorption  negative mix from less contribution from US Lighter sales  as well as increase in brand support investment (EZ Reach launch in Europe) and operating expenses. This was partly offset by strong price and favorable EUR/USD hedging.Q4 2023 Flame for Life division adjusted EBIT margin improved to 31.8%  versus 29.1% in Q4 2022. This improvement is mainly driven by favorable pricing  lower raw material costs  favorable EUR/USD hedging as well as manufacturing efficiencies.

This was a result of added value and new products’ robust Net Sales performance in the 3 to 5 blade and Hybrid ranges  notably in Europe and Latin America.In Europe  BIC successfully grew market share both in Western (France  Italy) and Eastern Europe (Poland  Romania) thanks to its value for money proposition in an inflationary environment. Net sales grew double digits  fueled by distribution gains. The 3 blade (Bic Flex 3) and Hybrid (Soleil Click and Hybrid Flex 5) segments were the largest contributors to net sales growth.In the US  performance was driven by our innovations including Easy Rinse  Soleil Escape  Sensitive 5 and Flex 5 Hybrid as consumers shifted to premium items  supporting BIC’s strategy to grow in these added-value segments. E-commerce performance added to Net sales growth  growing double digit thanks to strong execution and the success of new products. In a declining market  BIC gained market share in both Male and Female disposable segments and ended the year at +0.3 pts of total disposables14.Our trade-up strategy towards a value-added 3 blade-offering  along with volume increases  yielded solid results in Latin America. Net sales grew double digit in both Brazil and Mexico driven by the Soleil and Flex ranges as well as Comfort 3. In Brazil  we continued to develop our product portfolio manufactured locally. BIC solidified its #2 position  gaining market share in both volume  +0.8 pts  and value  +0.6 pts15  with further distribution gains and strong commercial execution through key marketing campaigns on premium products. In Mexico  innovations like Flex 5 and Soleil Escape  as well as distribution gains in traditional trade and Modern Mass Market brought incremental market share growth.FY 2023 Blade Excellence division adjusted EBIT margin was 12.7% versus 13.4% in FY 2022 impacted negatively by electricity costs inflation in the first half of the year  unfavorable forex (mainly the US dollar/Mexican peso) and unfavorable fixed cost absorption partially offset by favorable price and mix and manufacturing efficiencies.

Positive price and mix contribution through further innovation and trade-up  was partially offset by lower volumes in Developed Markets.In Europe  the geographical expansion in the Eastern countries  combined with BIC’s focus on its iconic products  such as 4-Colors  drove a mid-single-digit growth at constant currency. Net Sales were boosted by a new range of 4-Colors  Media Clic  and Super Clip. BIC gained market share in key countries such as France and the UK9  both online and offline  thanks to its value-for-money positioning which is increasingly relevant to consumers.In the US  net sales were driven by both core products (Correction Tape and Mechanical Pencil) as well as our Skin Creative segment (Inkbox semi-permanent tattoos and Bodymark tattoo marker)  in line with the Horizon strategy to grow in innovative segments.Despite a declining market  BIC remains a great value-for-money brand appealing to consumers and therefore maintained its market share notably boosted by Mechanical Pencil  Correction Tape  Highlighters  and Gel segments. Also strengthening its digital capabilities  BIC continued to grow in e-commerce  growing net sales by double digits and gaining 1.0 pts of market value share10.In Latin America  net sales grew by double digits in Brazil  driven by favorable price and mix. Key products such as 4-Colors and Coloring Felt Pen grew double digit  boosted by strong commercial execution with major clients.In the Middle East and Africa  net sales grew by double digits  fueled by both volume and price. Several key regions contributed to growth  such as West Africa and South Africa  which was driven by a strong Back to School sell-in.FY 2023 Human Expression division adjusted EBIT margin was 7.2% versus 3.0% in FY 2022. The increase was driven by a favorable price/mix  lower raw material costs  brand support investments  and manufacturing efficiencies. This was partially offset by unfavorable currency fluctuations  mainly the US dollar/Mexican peso  unfavorable fixed cost absorption  and higher operating expenses.Q4 2023 Human Expression division adjusted EBIT margin improved from -5.1% to 0% versus prior year. This was driven by gross profit increase (favorable pricing and mix and lower cost of production including raw material and electricity) as well as lower brand support and operating expenses. This was partially offset by unfavorable forex (mainly due to USD/MXN  USD/ARS and EUR/TRY).Flame for Lifein million euros Q4 2022 Q4 2023 FY 2022 FY 2023 Volumes in million units - - 1 647.4 1 603.2 % Change - - +4.9% (2.7)% Net Sales 219.6 217.1 871.6 851.5 Change as reported +21.7% (1.1)% +21.3% (2.3)% Change on a comparative basis +10.9% +1.7% +10.1% (0.3)% Change at constant currency +12.3% +7.8% +11.2% +3.3% Adjusted EBIT 63.8 69.0 305.5 290.4 Adjusted EBIT Margin 29.1% 31.8% 35.0% 34.1%The Flame for Life division’s FY 2023 Net Sales grew by 3.3% at constant currency  positively driven by distribution gains in Latin America  Europe and the Middle East and Africa. Volumes were negatively impacted by performance in the US but grew mid single digit versus pre-covid levels.In Europe  net sales grew high single digit driven by core lighter products and further distribution gains in Eastern Europe  as well as premium products such as Djeep and the EZ Reach launch  in line with our strategy to capture more flame occasions. The EZ Reach pocket utility lighter was launched into most major markets in Europe and accounted for almost 20% of total division’s growth versus last year.In the US  the total lighter market declined by 6.3% in volume and 2.8% in value11. However  BIC maintained its leadership position  gaining share in volume  +0.7 pts  and value  +1.3 pts boosted by the utility segment. Our EZ Reach lighter reached 5.8% of market share in value12  up +0.4 points thanks to strong distribution and in-store visibility in the Modern Mass market. In 2023  the US lighters business performance was negatively impacted by an unfavorable comparative basis in Q1 2023 as a result of negative phasing versus Q1 2022 (which benefited from delayed shipments following supply issues in Q4 2021) as well as competitive imports coming from Asia.In Latin America  Brazil net sales grew double digit driven by favorable price and mix  as well as increased distribution of decorated and utility lighters. The launch of the BIC EZ Reach utility pocket lighter in the fourth quarter was successful and contributed to net sales performance.In Middle East and Africa  net sale performance was driven by distribution expansion across the regions  notably Morrocco  Egypt and South Africa.FY 2023 Flame for Life division adjusted EBIT margin reached 34.1% versus 35.0% in FY 2022 driven by higher raw material costs  unfavorable fixed cost absorption  negative mix from less contribution from US Lighter sales  as well as increase in brand support investment (EZ Reach launch in Europe) and operating expenses. This was partly offset by strong price and favorable EUR/USD hedging.Q4 2023 Flame for Life division adjusted EBIT margin improved to 31.8%  versus 29.1% in Q4 2022. This improvement is mainly driven by favorable pricing  lower raw material costs  favorable EUR/USD hedging as well as manufacturing efficiencies. This was partially offset by higher brand support investments.Blade Excellencein million euros Q4 2022 Q4 2023 FY 2022 FY 2023 Volumes in million units - - 2 350.9 2 428.3 % Change - - +1.3% +3.3% Net Sales 124.0 129.4 497.0 536.8 Change as reported +28.9% +4.4% +23.9% +8.0% Change on a comparative basis +16.4% +8.6% +12.7% +11.6% Change at constant currency +20.6% +24.3% +14.6% +17.8% Adjusted EBIT 10.1 21.9 66.6 68.4 Adjusted EBIT Margin 8.1% 16.9% 13.4% 12.7%FY 2023 Blade Excellence division net sales grew 17.8% at constant currency  fueled by higher volumes and market share gains across all key regions13. This was a result of added value and new products’ robust Net Sales performance in the 3 to 5 blade and Hybrid ranges  notably in Europe and Latin America.In Europe  BIC successfully grew market share both in Western (France  Italy) and Eastern Europe (Poland  Romania) thanks to its value for money proposition in an inflationary environment. Net sales grew double digits  fueled by distribution gains. The 3 blade (Bic Flex 3) and Hybrid (Soleil Click and Hybrid Flex 5) segments were the largest contributors to net sales growth.In the US  performance was driven by our innovations including Easy Rinse  Soleil Escape  Sensitive 5 and Flex 5 Hybrid as consumers shifted to premium items  supporting BIC’s strategy to grow in these added-value segments. E-commerce performance added to Net sales growth  growing double digit thanks to strong execution and the success of new products. In a declining market  BIC gained market share in both Male and Female disposable segments and ended the year at +0.3 pts of total disposables14.Our trade-up strategy towards a value-added 3 blade-offering  along with volume increases  yielded solid results in Latin America. Net sales grew double digit in both Brazil and Mexico driven by the Soleil and Flex ranges as well as Comfort 3. In Brazil  we continued to develop our product portfolio manufactured locally. BIC solidified its #2 position  gaining market share in both volume  +0.8 pts  and value  +0.6 pts15  with further distribution gains and strong commercial execution through key marketing campaigns on premium products. In Mexico  innovations like Flex 5 and Soleil Escape  as well as distribution gains in traditional trade and Modern Mass Market brought incremental market share growth.FY 2023 Blade Excellence division adjusted EBIT margin was 12.7% versus 13.4% in FY 2022 impacted negatively by electricity costs inflation in the first half of the year  unfavorable forex (mainly the US dollar/Mexican peso) and unfavorable fixed cost absorption partially offset by favorable price and mix and manufacturing efficiencies. The margin was also impacted by higher brand support investments  mostly related to the launch of BIC® EasyRinse and its major advertising campaign in the US.Q4 2023 Blade Excellence division adjusted EBIT margin reached 16.9% versus 8.1% in Q4 2022  with a strong gross profit improvement driven by favorable price and mix  lower raw material costs  favorable fixed cost absorption as well as manufacturing efficiencies.

We delivered on our priorities. We generated profitable growth through strong sales organic growth  outperforming the market by 430 basis points  notably driven by market share gains in China  and through an improvement of our operating margin by 100bps to 5.3% of sales. Synergies with HELLA  ahead of our roadmap  contributed to this performance  and we are confident that we can expect higher synergies than initially expected by 2025.We delivered on our top priority: further deleveraging the company after the acquisition of HELLA. We reduced our net debt by close to one billion euros over the year  thanks to the combination of strong cash generation and successful completion of the first one-billion-euro disposal program that was launched mid-2022.We also achieved key milestones in different domains. We significantly improved profitability in our Seating North America  Clarion Electronics and Lighting activities. We accelerated the development of our hydrogen business by welcoming Stellantis  a major OEM  as a new partner in Symbio and inaugurating new production units for tanks and fuel cells. Regarding sustainability  which is core to our strategy and innovation  we stand one year ahead of schedule on our targets for scopes 1 & 2. The creation of Materi’Act  a company dedicated to the development of sustainable materials  will help the Group reaching its scope 3 objective and CO 2 net-zero by 2045. Finally  we registered a strong and selective order intake of 31 billion euros  with profitability aligned with our Power25 targets and reduced upfront costs: this reflects the high attractiveness of our business  aligned with the industry megatrends.Let me thank FORVIA’s teams for all efforts they have deployed to achieve this 2023 solid performance.2024 will be another step forward on our Power25 trajectory. We will maintain strong focus on sustainable and profitable growth and accelerate deleveraging  thanks to our Manage by Cash program  as well as the second one-billion-euro disposal program that is already underway. We will also make sure to stay agile and take the necessary measures in the face of anticipated medium-term market evolution.Today  we announced our intention to launch “EU-FORWARD”  a project that is intended to be rolled out over the next five years to reinforce the competitiveness and agility of our operations in Europe and achieve significantly higher profitability. This objective is to be supported by FORVIA’s acceleration on Artificial Intelligence across the Group  aiming at optimizing R&D investment and costs as well as Program Management  while maintaining high level of technology and innovation. We keep building a stronger Group  able to compete in a fast-changing environment.”The 2023 consolidated financial statements have been approved by the Board of Directors at its meeting held on February 16  2024  under the chairmanship of Michel de ROSEN.These financial statements have been audited.All financial terms used in this press release are explained at the end of this document  under the section “Definitions of terms used in this document”.IFRS 5 – Discontinued operationsFaurecia’s SAS Cockpit Modules division (assembly and logistics services)  that was part of the Interiors Business Group and whose contemplated disposal was announced on February 19  2023  is presented as Discontinued Operations.All figures related to worldwide or regional automotive production refer to the S&P Global Mobility forecast dated February 2024.2023 KEY ACHIEVEMENTSSuccessful completion of the first €1bn disposal program launched in Q2 2022 (proceeds of c. €320m in 2022 and c. €700m in 2023) that contributed to close to €1bn net debt reduction in 2023(proceeds of c. €320m in 2022 and c. €700m in 2023) Launch of a second €1bn disposal program to accelerate deleveragingAt the end of Q3 2023  FORVIA had completed the first €1 billion disposal program launched in Q2 2022:c. €320 million were already cashed in 2022 mainly through the disposal by HELLA of its stake in the HBPO joint venture the remaining c. €700 million was cashed in 2023 through: (i) the sale of a 16.66% stake in Symbio to Stellantis  (ii) the sale of SAS Cockpit Modules division to the Motherson Group  and (iii) the sale of part of commercial vehicle exhaust gas aftertreatment business in Europe and in the United-States to Cummins.Thus  in less than 15 months  FORVIA has successfully achieved its target to fulfil its disposal program. All operations carried out under this program have strengthened the Group’s focus on its strategic priorities and were executed with good valuations.In October 2023  FORVIA announced the launch of a second €1 billion disposal program that will further simplify the Group’s portfolio  as well as accelerate deleveraging beyond the initial POWER25 objective.The first step of this second program is the disposal by HELLA of its 50% stake in BHTC  co-owned with MAHLE  which was already announced along with the launch of the second €1bn disposal program and represents a total enterprise value of c. €600m and cash proceeds to come estimated at c. €200 million for each of the two partners in the joint venture.Synergies with HELLA ahead of roadmap  with €190m of cumulated net cost synergies achieved at the end of 2023  and cumulated net cost synergies to be achieved at the end of 2025 upgraded to more than €350 million on an annual basis (from more than €300 million previously)In 2023  the pace of the combination with HELLA accelerated and cumulated cost synergies generated at the end of 2023 amounted to €190 million  ahead of roadmap. This figure is to be compared with €51 million at the end of 2022.This result was achieved through numerous projects in key areas  including procurements  freight  and SG&A. In July 2023  was created FH Services S.A.S.  a joint venture co-owned and co-managed by HELLA and FORVIA and designed to leverage the combined strengths of a shared organization  that will serve as the global provider of leading IT and Indirect Purchasing solutions to FORVIA’s collective 150 000 internal business users worldwide.Good progress since the start of the synergies program allows FORVIA to upgrade its previous target of reaching more than €300 million of cost synergies by 2025 to more than €350 million within the same timeframe.In 2023  as regards commercial synergies  FORVIA and HELLA made joint presentations for the first time at the CES in Las Vegas  then at the Shanghai Auto Show and at the IAA Mobility fair in Munich. That was again the case at the CES in Las Vegas that took place early January 2024.Strong and selective order intake of €31bn  with profitability aligned with POWER25 targets and reduced upfrontIn 2023  FORVIA recorded an order intake of €31 billion  a high level reflecting strong momentum of all its Business Groups.The order intake recorded in 2023 has an average operating margin aligned with the Group’s POWER25 objectives and will generate c. €300m savings versus initial upfront cost estimate.Accelerating transformation of the Group’s operations through the development of sustainable and innovative solutionsIn 2023  FORVIA improved it Sustainability ratings with MSCI to an A-rating and  early 2024  with CDP  also to an A-rating. The Group is also rated 11.3 by Sustainalytics (i.e. “low risk”).As regards its roadmap to net-zero  at the end of 2023  FORVIA stands one year ahead of schedule for scopes 1 & 2  with over 40% CO 2 reduction already achieved  a goal initially targeted for end-2024. FORVIA keeps committed to achieving CO2 neutrality for scopes 1 & 2 by end-2025 and to reduce scope 3 emissions by 45% by end-2030  before reaching net-zero all scopes by end-2045.In November 2023  Materi’Act  FORVIA’s company dedicated to the development  industrialization  and marketing of unique  cutting-edge materials with a low CO 2 footprint  inaugurated its headquarters and R&D center in Villeurbanne (France).This center brings together engineers  researchers  and data scientists  and is destined to become a world-class center of excellence  and one of Europe's leading centers in the field of materials with very low CO 2 footprint.In January 2024  FORVIA’s presence at the 2024 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas reflected innovation focused on sustainable mobility.Each of FORVIA’s demonstrators at the 2024 CEs was designed for Scope 3  in order to respond to the industry's technical and technological evolution while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In addition  FORVIA received 4 “Accolades” at the CES 2024 Innovation Awards in the category “Vehicle Tech & Advanced Mobility”.New milestones in FORVIA’s hydrogen strategyIn July 2023  Stellantis acquired an equal stake with FORVIA and Michelin in Symbio  a leader in zero-emission hydrogen mobility. The entry of a major OEM  Stellantis  in the joint venture that was previously co-owned (50/50) by FORVIA and Michelin will not only increase Symbio’s capabilities but will also accelerate and globalize Symbio’s growth to the benefit of its customers.Early October 2023  FORVIA inaugurated in Allenjoie (France) its first mass production plant of hydrogen storage tanks for mobility applications in Europe. This new site is sized to produce 100 000 tanks a year by 2030 and will reduce by five times its production costs between 2023 and 2025. The complete hydrogen storage systems produced at Allenjoie already equip commercial fleets of Stellantis (Opel Vivaro-e  Citroën e-Jumpy  Peugeot e-Expert) and Hyvia (Renault Master Van H2 Tech).Early December 2023  Symbio inaugurated in Saint-Fons (France) its first gigafactory SymphonHy  Europe's largest integrated site producing hydrogen fuel cells with a target to produce 50 000 fuel cell systems by 2026.This gigafactory is part of HyMotive  a strategic €1 billion project to develop disruptive technology  supported by the European Union and the French government as part of the IPCEI (Important Project of Scientific Interest) program.As regards significant hydrogen awards  it is worth mentioning two new contracts signed late 2023 in North America  whose production will start in 2025:A first one with a major automotive manufacturer to supply Type IV hydrogen storage systems for medium-duty commercial trucks A second one with a major clean energy technology company to supply Type IV hydrogen storage systems for heavy-duty commercial vehicles.Effective end of the loss-making Michigan JIT Seating program in North America  successful turnaround of Clarion Electronics  within the Electronics Business Group  and significant improvement in profitability of the Lighting Business GroupAs already mentioned in previous communications  FORVIA closed its Michigan Seating JIT (Just-In-Time) operations for the Jeep Grand Wagoneer at the end of September 2023 (the remaining part of this program having been transferred to FORVIA’s Seating plant in Monterrey  Mexico). The extra-costs generated by this program in the first nine months of 2023 still amounted to €30 million  an improvement of €50 million over the €80 million incurred in 2022. The movement of the program will contribute to further improve profitability of the Group’s North American Seating operations in 2024.In 2023  Clarion Electronics  the former Electronics activity of Faurecia before the acquisition of HELLA now combined within the Electronics Business Group of FORVIA  has successfully managed the turnaround of its operations. In H1 2023  these operations  representing about 25% of FORVIA’s Electronics Business Group  recorded an operating loss that mainly reflected high increase in freight costs to maintain supply of semiconductors and an unfavorable geographic mix. In H2 2023  thanks to gradual improvement of the supply chain and strong organic growth  Clarion Electronics was back to significant profit  more than compensating the loss recorded in H1.In 2023  the Lighting Business Group confirmed its recovery in operating margin to 5.1% of sales in 2023 (vs. 3.5% of sales in 2022)  tracking ahead of its POWER25 objective.2023 KEY FIGURESLight vehicle production reached 90 million in 2023  up 9.7% vs. 2022Worldwide automotive production showed strong dynamics in 2023  with a global production of 90.3 million light vehicles  corresponding to a 9.7% growth year on year.The market was supported by a robust global demand and gradual improvement of semi-conductor’s supply.The 2023 level exceeded the c. 89 million LV production reached in 2019 (pre-Covid level)  but with a different regional mix:In Europ e excl.

As a reminder  after having reached an agreement with the OEM related to this project  FORVIA came out of the JIT part of this program  that was loss-making  at the end of Q3 2023. It also included a positive regional mix impact  as activity in China grew strongly and is accretive to operating margin  Conversely  operating margin was penalized by inflation headwinds in JIT operations and structural overcapacities in Europe.INTERIORS (18% of Group consolidated sales in the period): Profitability penalized by European operationsINTERIORS (in €m) 2022* Currency Organic 2023 Reported effect growth change Worldwide auto. production (m units) 82 344 90 321 9.7% Sales 4 645 -258 536 4 923 6.0% % of last year's sales -5.6% 11.5% outperformance (bps) +180bps Operating income 191 201 5.0% 4.1% 4.1% stable * Restated for SAS (part of the ""Interiors"" Business Group)  presented as Discontinued operations as from January 1  2022SalesSolid organic sales outperformance of 180bps was mainly driven by: Organic sales growth in Europe of +22%  mainly Ford  JLR and RNM  Organic sales growth in China of +20%  mainly Chang’an and Li Auto.Operating incomeOperating margin of 4.1%  stable vs. 2022.

The pace of margin expansion was fostered by improved performances in Electronics and Lighting but penalized by Seating and Interiors  Operating margin in Americas also increased from 2.6% in 2022 to 4.3% in 2023  mainly driven by improved profitability of US operations  the reduction of extra-costs related to Highland Park Seating program and despite inflation and UAW strike headwinds  Operating margin in Asia improved from 10.6% in 2022 to 11.0% in 2023  demonstrating robustness of double-digit operating margin in China.As regards FORVIA’s future business developments with Chinese OEMs in China and outside China:In 2023  FORVIA and BYD announced that will reinforce their partnership with the construction of new seat assembly plant in Thailand FORVIA and BYD will launch the construction of a new state-of-the-art seat-assembly plant in the Rayong province of Thailand that will produce complete seat sets. This strengthens the partnership developed with BYD  already active through seven cutting-edge factories established in China  including four within the past 18 months.Also in 2023  FORVIA and CHERY have decided to join forces for smart cockpit development FORVIA and CHERY will jointly develop a smart cockpit software and a hardware platform integrating FORVIA’s products and technologies  to be integrated in CHERY vehicles and create an in-vehicle and out-vehicle systematic  integrative  and intelligent brand-new user experience.

EBITDA ratio improvement reflect that FORVIA is fully in line with its commitment to rapidly deleverage the company  after the acquisition of HELLA.AVAILABLE LIQUIDITY OF €6.2 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31  2023As of December 31  2023  Group liquidity amounted to €6.2billion  of which €4.3 billion of available cash  €1.5 billion from the fully undrawn FORVIA Senior Credit Facility and €450 million from the fully undrawn HELLA Senior Credit Facility.FORVIA’s proactive debt management actions in 2023 included:Extension of the maturity of close to the entirety of the €1.5 billion Senior Credit Facility by one year to May 2027 (with options up to May 2028) Refinancing of the €500 million line now maturing June 2026 (with two possible extensions by one year each) Refinancing of a €150 million term loan till June 2025 Purchase back of €150 million out of a €950 million SLB Bonds due 2026 at 7.25% Issuance of Samurai Bonds for JPY19.2 million (c. €120 million)  allocated across three tranches (2.25 years  3.25 years and 5 years).Between August and November 2023  all three rating agencies have upgraded their outlook from negative to stable.LAUNCH OF “EU-FORWARD”  A FIVE-YEAR PROJECT TO REINFORCE THE COMPETITIVENESS AND AGILITY OF THE GROUP’S OPERATIONS IN EUROPEWhile the European automotive market does not offer volume dynamics in the coming years and remains significantly below its 2019 level  it still represents the largest market for the Group with EMEA at 46% of sales in 2023  but only 22% of operating income.Between 2019 and 2023:European production fell by 16% from 21.2 million light vehicles (19.2 million  excluding Russia) to 17.9 million light vehicles (16.7 million  excluding Russia)  while production in Asia grew by 12% from 46.2 million light vehicles (of which 24.4 million in China) to 51.6 million light vehicles (of which 28.8 million in China) Consequently  the share of Europe within worldwide automotive production fell from 24% to 20% and the share of Asia gained 5 percentage points from 52% in 2019 to 57% in 2023 (including China  whose share also gained 5 percentage points from 27% to 32%).In addition  latest forecasts anticipate almost no growth between 2023 and 2030 in European automotive production  while they anticipate production in the rest of the world to grow by c. 9% during the same period.During the same 2019-2023 period:The share of EMEA within FORVIA’s sales fell from 50% in 2019 (before the acquisition of HELLA) to 46% in 2023 The operating margin of FORVIA’s operations in the region fell from 6.6% (before the acquisition of HELLA and in a pre-Covid/non-inflationary environment) to 2.5% in 2023 (after the acquisition of HELLA and in a post-Covid/inflationary environment).In front of this evolution  FORVIA needs to take appropriate measures to reinforce the competitiveness and agility of its European operations (including addressing structural overcapacities) and achieve significantly higher profitability. This would rebalance the contribution of the different regions to the Group’s operating income  thus reducing the Group’s dependency to China  while continuing to grow in this region.FORVIA announces today its intention to launch a project  named “EU-FORWARD”  of which the FORVIA European Committee bureau is informed today.This project has the objectives to:Adapt the Group’s operations to the fast-changing environment  including ICE-ban schedule in Europe that obliges the entire industry to adapt its structure and costs to the evolving regulation Be ready for an evolution of the customer landscape  with the arrival of newcomers from Asia Improve FORVIA’s profitability in the region  thus rebalancing FORVIA’s regional mix in terms of contribution to the Group’s performance.The project should be rolled-out across the Group’s European operations and run over a period of five years  from 2024 to 2028.Over this period  the Group intends to concentrate its efforts on the adaptation of the regional manufacturing and R&D set-up to the new European environment  through benefiting from generative AI adoption and addressing structural overcapacities.This project could impact up to 10 000 jobs over the five- year period (to be compared with c. 75 500 at end-2023) and should need incremental restructuring costs:From a P&L standpoint   restructuring charge dedicated to Europe over the 2024-2028 period should be upgraded by c. 50% to c. €1 billion  broadly equally split between the 2024-2025 period and the 2026-2028 period   restructuring charge dedicated to Europe over the 2024-2028 period should be upgraded by c. 50% to c. €1 billion  broadly equally split between the 2024-2025 period and the 2026-2028 period  From a cash standpoint   restructuring outflow dedicated to Europe over the 2024-2028 period should be upgraded by c. 50% to c. €800 million  also broadly equally split between the 2024-2025 period and the 2026-2028 period.Expected savings should reach c. €500 million on an annual basis in 2028.At Group level:Total P&L restructuring charge should amount to close to 1.2 billion euros  broadly equally split between the 2024 period and the 2026-2028 period Total cash restructurings for the Group should amount to close to 1 billion euros  also broadly equally split between the 2024 period and the 2026-2028 period.To minimize as much as possible the impact of employment at the 2028 horizon  on top of natural attrition  FORVIA is targeting immediately and drastically reducing recruitment in Europe  adapting the level of non-permanent employment  and strongly reducing the usage of external R&D resources.Through the implementation of this project  FORVIA would significantly enhance the sustainable competitiveness of its operations in EMEA and targets by 2028:To achieve significantly higher profitability exceeding 7% of sales in the region (vs. 2.5% of sales in 2023) To rebalance the Group’s regional mix with EMEA representing c. 40% of sales in 2028 (vs. 46% in 2023) and c. 35% of operating income (vs. 22% in 2023).This goal will be supported by the deployment of a global initiative named “AI/GenAI TRANSFORMATION” aiming at optimizing R&D investment and costs as well as Program Management  while maintaining high level of technology and innovationLeveraging on the huge potential offered by AI and GenAI  FORVIA will accelerate on innovation at lower cost and increased efficiency.Actions will include:Dedicated AI teams in every Business Group and one central Group platform Ensure best-in-class data management and IT environment to enable AI solutions.More than 250 most promising AI uses cases will be promoted and prioritized across the Group  not only for R&D but also for Program Management  and high benefit use cases will be driven at scale.The ambition of this project is to achieve up to 50% of efficiency gains on R&D and core teams.PROPOSED DIVIDEND OF €0.50 PER SHAREAt its latest meeting held on February 16  2024  the Board of Directors decided to propose at the next Annual Shareholders’ Meeting to be held in Nanterre (France) on May 30  2024  the payment of a dividend of €0.50 per share to be paid in cash.This dividend:Is consistent with the POWER25 plan’s commitment to reinstate dividend as from 2024  as deleveraging has significantly accelerated in 2023 Reflects the Group’s confidence in its capability to generate sustainable profit growth and enhanced cash flow in the coming years.The proposed amount  below the stated dividend policy  reconciles the Group’s willingness to reward its shareholders  after two years of dividend payment suspension  with that of pursuing accelerated deleveraging and financing transformative projects to further enhance the Group’s competitiveness.2024 GUIDANCEThis guidance is based on:Broadly stable worldwide automotive production in 2024 vs. 2023  in line with S&P’s latest forecast dated February 2024 that estimates 90.0 million light vehicles produced in 2024 vs. 90.3 million in 2023 (-0.4%) Average 2024 currency rates of 1.10 for €/USD and of 7.50 for €/CNY and assumes no major disruption materially impacting production or retail sales in any automotive region during the year.It takes into consideration:A limited negative scope effect on sales of c. €50 million as the net effect of the disposal of the CVI business to Cummins (deconsolidated as from Q4 2023) for €(300) million largely offset by the consolidation as from January 1  2024 of HELLA’s joint-venture in Lighting in China for c. €250 million The impact of the first step  already announced  of the second €1 billion disposal program underway  i.e. the disposal by HELLA of its 50% stake in BHTC that should contribute cash proceeds estimated at c. €200 million.2024 guidance is on track to reach POWER25 ambition:Sales of between €27.5 billion and 28.5 billionOperating margin between 5.6% and 6.4% of salesNCF ≥ 2023 in valueNet debt/Adjusted EBITDA ratio ≤ 1.9x at Dec. 31  2024ON TRACK TO POWER25 AMBITIONThe Group reiterates its FY2025 objectives  as presented at the Capital Markets Day held in November 2022:Sales of c. €30bnOperating margin > 7% of salesNCF of 4% salesNet debt/Adjusted EBITDA ratio of < 1.5x at Dec. 31  2025These objectives were based on average 2025 currency rates of 1.05 for €/USD and of 7.00 for €/CNY and assumed no major disruption materially impacting production or retail sales in any major automotive region over the period.These objectives  evidently  did not take into consideration any

It corresponds to net income of fully consolidated companies before:Amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations; Other non-recurring operating income and expense  corresponding to material  unusual and non-recurring items including reorganization expenses and early retirement costs  the impact of exceptional events such as the discontinuation of a business  the closure or sale of an industrial site  disposals of non-operating buildings  impairment losses recorded for property  plant and equipment or intangible assets  as well as other material and unusual losses; Income on loans  cash investments and marketable securities; Finance costs; Other financial income and expense  which include the impact of discounting the pension benefit obligation and the return on related plan assets  the ineffective portion of interest rate and currency hedges  changes in value of interest rate and currency instruments for which the hedging relationship does not satisfy the criteria set forth in relationship cannot be demonstrated under IFRS 9  and gains and losses on sales of shares in subsidiaries; Taxes.Adjusted EBITDAAdjusted EBITDA is Operating income as defined above + depreciation and amortization of assets; to be fully compliant with the ESMA (European Securities and Markets Authority) regulation  this term of “Adjusted EBITDA” will be used by the Group as of January 1  2022 instead of the term “EBITDA” that was previously used (this means that “EBITDA” aggregates until 2021 are comparable with ‘Adjusted EBITDA” aggregates as from 2022).Net cash-flowNet cash-flow is defined as follow: Net cash from (used in) operating and investing activities less (acquisitions)/disposal of equity interests and businesses (net of cash and cash equivalents)  other changes and proceeds from disposal of financial assets. Repayment of IFRS 16 debt is not included.Net financial debtNet financial debt is defined as follow: Gross financial debt less cash and cash equivalents and derivatives classified under non-current and current assets. It includes the lease liabilities (IFRS 16 debt).Attachment",neutral,0.02,0.62,0.36,mixed,0.64,0.29,0.07,True,English,"['FULL YEAR RESULTS', 'typo page', 'group level', 'Correction', 'paragraph', 'S&P Global Mobility', 'first €1bn disposal program', 'second €1bn disposal program', 'first one-billion-euro disposal program', 'Net debt/Adjusted EBITDA ratio', 'growing worldwide automotive production', 'Cumulated net cost synergies', '1 BILLION NET DEBT REDUCTION', 'Strong net cash flow', 'Net debt/Adj.

We delivered on our priorities. We generated profitable growth through strong sales organic growth  outperforming the market by 430 basis points  notably driven by market share gains in China  and through an improvement of our operating margin by 100bps to 5.3% of sales. Synergies with HELLA  ahead of our roadmap  contributed to this performance  and we are confident that we can expect higher synergies than initially expected by 2025.We delivered on our top priority: further deleveraging the company after the acquisition of HELLA. We reduced our net debt by close to one billion euros over the year  thanks to the combination of strong cash generation and successful completion of the first one-billion-euro disposal program that was launched mid-2022.We also achieved key milestones in different domains. We significantly improved profitability in our Seating North America  Clarion Electronics and Lighting activities. We accelerated the development of our hydrogen business by welcoming Stellantis  a major OEM  as a new partner in Symbio and inaugurating new production units for tanks and fuel cells. Regarding sustainability  which is core to our strategy and innovation  we stand one year ahead of schedule on our targets for scopes 1 & 2. The creation of Materi’Act  a company dedicated to the development of sustainable materials  will help the Group reaching its scope 3 objective and CO 2 net-zero by 2045. Finally  we registered a strong and selective order intake of 31 billion euros  with profitability aligned with our Power25 targets and reduced upfront costs: this reflects the high attractiveness of our business  aligned with the industry megatrends.Let me thank FORVIA’s teams for all efforts they have deployed to achieve this 2023 solid performance.2024 will be another step forward on our Power25 trajectory. We will maintain strong focus on sustainable and profitable growth and accelerate deleveraging  thanks to our Manage by Cash program  as well as the second one-billion-euro disposal program that is already underway. We will also make sure to stay agile and take the necessary measures in the face of anticipated medium-term market evolution.Today  we announced our intention to launch “EU-FORWARD”  a project that is intended to be rolled out over the next five years to reinforce the competitiveness and agility of our operations in Europe and achieve significantly higher profitability. This objective is to be supported by FORVIA’s acceleration on Artificial Intelligence across the Group  aiming at optimizing R&D investment and costs as well as Program Management  while maintaining high level of technology and innovation. We keep building a stronger Group  able to compete in a fast-changing environment.”The 2023 consolidated financial statements have been approved by the Board of Directors at its meeting held on February 16  2024  under the chairmanship of Michel de ROSEN.These financial statements have been audited.All financial terms used in this press release are explained at the end of this document  under the section “Definitions of terms used in this document”.IFRS 5 – Discontinued operationsFaurecia’s SAS Cockpit Modules division (assembly and logistics services)  that was part of the Interiors Business Group and whose contemplated disposal was announced on February 19  2023  is presented as Discontinued Operations.All figures related to worldwide or regional automotive production refer to the S&P Global Mobility forecast dated February 2024.2023 KEY ACHIEVEMENTSSuccessful completion of the first €1bn disposal program launched in Q2 2022 (proceeds of c. €320m in 2022 and c. €700m in 2023) that contributed to close to €1bn net debt reduction in 2023(proceeds of c. €320m in 2022 and c. €700m in 2023) Launch of a second €1bn disposal program to accelerate deleveragingAt the end of Q3 2023  FORVIA had completed the first €1 billion disposal program launched in Q2 2022:c. €320 million were already cashed in 2022 mainly through the disposal by HELLA of its stake in the HBPO joint venture the remaining c. €700 million was cashed in 2023 through: (i) the sale of a 16.66% stake in Symbio to Stellantis  (ii) the sale of SAS Cockpit Modules division to the Motherson Group  and (iii) the sale of part of commercial vehicle exhaust gas aftertreatment business in Europe and in the United-States to Cummins.Thus  in less than 15 months  FORVIA has successfully achieved its target to fulfil its disposal program. All operations carried out under this program have strengthened the Group’s focus on its strategic priorities and were executed with good valuations.In October 2023  FORVIA announced the launch of a second €1 billion disposal program that will further simplify the Group’s portfolio  as well as accelerate deleveraging beyond the initial POWER25 objective.The first step of this second program is the disposal by HELLA of its 50% stake in BHTC  co-owned with MAHLE  which was already announced along with the launch of the second €1bn disposal program and represents a total enterprise value of c. €600m and cash proceeds to come estimated at c. €200 million for each of the two partners in the joint venture.Synergies with HELLA ahead of roadmap  with €190m of cumulated net cost synergies achieved at the end of 2023  and cumulated net cost synergies to be achieved at the end of 2025 upgraded to more than €350 million on an annual basis (from more than €300 million previously)In 2023  the pace of the combination with HELLA accelerated and cumulated cost synergies generated at the end of 2023 amounted to €190 million  ahead of roadmap. This figure is to be compared with €51 million at the end of 2022.This result was achieved through numerous projects in key areas  including procurements  freight  and SG&A. In July 2023  was created FH Services S.A.S.  a joint venture co-owned and co-managed by HELLA and FORVIA and designed to leverage the combined strengths of a shared organization  that will serve as the global provider of leading IT and Indirect Purchasing solutions to FORVIA’s collective 150 000 internal business users worldwide.Good progress since the start of the synergies program allows FORVIA to upgrade its previous target of reaching more than €300 million of cost synergies by 2025 to more than €350 million within the same timeframe.In 2023  as regards commercial synergies  FORVIA and HELLA made joint presentations for the first time at the CES in Las Vegas  then at the Shanghai Auto Show and at the IAA Mobility fair in Munich. That was again the case at the CES in Las Vegas that took place early January 2024.Strong and selective order intake of €31bn  with profitability aligned with POWER25 targets and reduced upfrontIn 2023  FORVIA recorded an order intake of €31 billion  a high level reflecting strong momentum of all its Business Groups.The order intake recorded in 2023 has an average operating margin aligned with the Group’s POWER25 objectives and will generate c. €300m savings versus initial upfront cost estimate.Accelerating transformation of the Group’s operations through the development of sustainable and innovative solutionsIn 2023  FORVIA improved it Sustainability ratings with MSCI to an A-rating and  early 2024  with CDP  also to an A-rating. The Group is also rated 11.3 by Sustainalytics (i.e. “low risk”).As regards its roadmap to net-zero  at the end of 2023  FORVIA stands one year ahead of schedule for scopes 1 & 2  with over 40% CO 2 reduction already achieved  a goal initially targeted for end-2024. FORVIA keeps committed to achieving CO2 neutrality for scopes 1 & 2 by end-2025 and to reduce scope 3 emissions by 45% by end-2030  before reaching net-zero all scopes by end-2045.In November 2023  Materi’Act  FORVIA’s company dedicated to the development  industrialization  and marketing of unique  cutting-edge materials with a low CO 2 footprint  inaugurated its headquarters and R&D center in Villeurbanne (France).This center brings together engineers  researchers  and data scientists  and is destined to become a world-class center of excellence  and one of Europe's leading centers in the field of materials with very low CO 2 footprint.In January 2024  FORVIA’s presence at the 2024 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas reflected innovation focused on sustainable mobility.Each of FORVIA’s demonstrators at the 2024 CEs was designed for Scope 3  in order to respond to the industry's technical and technological evolution while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In addition  FORVIA received 4 “Accolades” at the CES 2024 Innovation Awards in the category “Vehicle Tech & Advanced Mobility”.New milestones in FORVIA’s hydrogen strategyIn July 2023  Stellantis acquired an equal stake with FORVIA and Michelin in Symbio  a leader in zero-emission hydrogen mobility. The entry of a major OEM  Stellantis  in the joint venture that was previously co-owned (50/50) by FORVIA and Michelin will not only increase Symbio’s capabilities but will also accelerate and globalize Symbio’s growth to the benefit of its customers.Early October 2023  FORVIA inaugurated in Allenjoie (France) its first mass production plant of hydrogen storage tanks for mobility applications in Europe. This new site is sized to produce 100 000 tanks a year by 2030 and will reduce by five times its production costs between 2023 and 2025. The complete hydrogen storage systems produced at Allenjoie already equip commercial fleets of Stellantis (Opel Vivaro-e  Citroën e-Jumpy  Peugeot e-Expert) and Hyvia (Renault Master Van H2 Tech).Early December 2023  Symbio inaugurated in Saint-Fons (France) its first gigafactory SymphonHy  Europe's largest integrated site producing hydrogen fuel cells with a target to produce 50 000 fuel cell systems by 2026.This gigafactory is part of HyMotive  a strategic €1 billion project to develop disruptive technology  supported by the European Union and the French government as part of the IPCEI (Important Project of Scientific Interest) program.As regards significant hydrogen awards  it is worth mentioning two new contracts signed late 2023 in North America  whose production will start in 2025:A first one with a major automotive manufacturer to supply Type IV hydrogen storage systems for medium-duty commercial trucks A second one with a major clean energy technology company to supply Type IV hydrogen storage systems for heavy-duty commercial vehicles.Effective end of the loss-making Michigan JIT Seating program in North America  successful turnaround of Clarion Electronics  within the Electronics Business Group  and significant improvement in profitability of the Lighting Business GroupAs already mentioned in previous communications  FORVIA closed its Michigan Seating JIT (Just-In-Time) operations for the Jeep Grand Wagoneer at the end of September 2023 (the remaining part of this program having been transferred to FORVIA’s Seating plant in Monterrey  Mexico). The extra-costs generated by this program in the first nine months of 2023 still amounted to €30 million  an improvement of €50 million over the €80 million incurred in 2022. The movement of the program will contribute to further improve profitability of the Group’s North American Seating operations in 2024.In 2023  Clarion Electronics  the former Electronics activity of Faurecia before the acquisition of HELLA now combined within the Electronics Business Group of FORVIA  has successfully managed the turnaround of its operations. In H1 2023  these operations  representing about 25% of FORVIA’s Electronics Business Group  recorded an operating loss that mainly reflected high increase in freight costs to maintain supply of semiconductors and an unfavorable geographic mix. In H2 2023  thanks to gradual improvement of the supply chain and strong organic growth  Clarion Electronics was back to significant profit  more than compensating the loss recorded in H1.In 2023  the Lighting Business Group confirmed its recovery in operating margin to 5.1% of sales in 2023 (vs. 3.5% of sales in 2022)  tracking ahead of its POWER25 objective.2023 KEY FIGURESLight vehicle production reached 90 million in 2023  up 9.7% vs. 2022Worldwide automotive production showed strong dynamics in 2023  with a global production of 90.3 million light vehicles  corresponding to a 9.7% growth year on year.The market was supported by a robust global demand and gradual improvement of semi-conductor’s supply.The 2023 level exceeded the c. 89 million LV production reached in 2019 (pre-Covid level)  but with a different regional mix:In Europ e excl.

This would rebalance the contribution of the different regions to the Group’s operating income  thus reducing the Group’s dependency to China  while continuing to grow in this region.FORVIA announces today its intention to launch a project  named “EU-FORWARD”  of which the FORVIA European Committee bureau is informed today.This project has the objectives to:Adapt the Group’s operations to the fast-changing environment  including ICE-ban schedule in Europe that obliges the entire industry to adapt its structure and costs to the evolving regulation Be ready for an evolution of the customer landscape  with the arrival of newcomers from Asia Improve FORVIA’s profitability in the region  thus rebalancing FORVIA’s regional mix in terms of contribution to the Group’s performance.The project should be rolled-out across the Group’s European operations and run over a period of five years  from 2024 to 2028.Over this period  the Group intends to concentrate its efforts on the adaptation of the regional manufacturing and R&D set-up to the new European environment  through benefiting from generative AI adoption and addressing structural overcapacities.This project could impact up to 10 000 jobs over the five- year period (to be compared with c. 75 500 at end-2023) and should need incremental restructuring costs:From a P&L standpoint   restructuring charge dedicated to Europe over the 2024-2028 period should be upgraded by c. 50% to c. €1 billion  broadly equally split between the 2024-2025 period and the 2026-2028 period   restructuring charge dedicated to Europe over the 2024-2028 period should be upgraded by c. 50% to c. €1 billion  broadly equally split between the 2024-2025 period and the 2026-2028 period  From a cash standpoint   restructuring outflow dedicated to Europe over the 2024-2028 period should be upgraded by c. 50% to c. €800 million  also broadly equally split between the 2024-2025 period and the 2026-2028 period.Expected savings should reach c. €500 million on an annual basis in 2028.At Group level:Total P&L restructuring charge should amount to close to 1 billion euros  broadly equally split between the 2024 period and the 2026-2028 period Total cash restructurings for the Group should amount to close to 1.2 billion euros  also broadly equally split between the 2024 period and the 2026-2028 period.To minimize as much as possible the impact of employment at the 2028 horizon  on top of natural attrition  FORVIA is targeting immediately and drastically reducing recruitment in Europe  adapting the level of non-permanent employment  and strongly reducing the usage of external R&D resources.Through the implementation of this project  FORVIA would significantly enhance the sustainable competitiveness of its operations in EMEA and targets by 2028:To achieve significantly higher profitability exceeding 7% of sales in the region (vs. 2.5% of sales in 2023) To rebalance the Group’s regional mix with EMEA representing c. 40% of sales in 2028 (vs. 46% in 2023) and c. 35% of operating income (vs. 22% in 2023).This goal will be supported by the deployment of a global initiative named “AI/GenAI TRANSFORMATION” aiming at optimizing R&D investment and costs as well as Program Management  while maintaining high level of technology and innovationLeveraging on the huge potential offered by AI and GenAI  FORVIA will accelerate on innovation at lower cost and increased efficiency.Actions will include:Dedicated AI teams in every Business Group and one central Group platform Ensure best-in-class data management and IT environment to enable AI solutions.More than 250 most promising AI uses cases will be promoted and prioritized across the Group  not only for R&D but also for Program Management  and high benefit use cases will be driven at scale.The ambition of this project is to achieve up to 50% of efficiency gains on R&D and core teams.PROPOSED DIVIDEND OF €0.50 PER SHAREAt its latest meeting held on February 16  2024  the Board of Directors decided to propose at the next Annual Shareholders’ Meeting to be held in Nanterre (France) on May 30  2024  the payment of a dividend of €0.50 per share to be paid in cash.This dividend:Is consistent with the POWER25 plan’s commitment to reinstate dividend as from 2024  as deleveraging has significantly accelerated in 2023 Reflects the Group’s confidence in its capability to generate sustainable profit growth and enhanced cash flow in the coming years.The proposed amount  below the stated dividend policy  reconciles the Group’s willingness to reward its shareholders  after two years of dividend payment suspension  with that of pursuing accelerated deleveraging and financing transformative projects to further enhance the Group’s competitiveness.2024 GUIDANCEThis guidance is based on:Broadly stable worldwide automotive production in 2024 vs. 2023  in line with S&P’s latest forecast dated February 2024 that estimates 90.0 million light vehicles produced in 2024 vs. 90.3 million in 2023 (-0.4%) Average 2024 currency rates of 1.10 for €/USD and of 7.50 for €/CNY and assumes no major disruption materially impacting production or retail sales in any automotive region during the year.It takes into consideration:A limited negative scope effect on sales of c. €50 million as the net effect of the disposal of the CVI business to Cummins (deconsolidated as from Q4 2023) for €(300) million largely offset by the consolidation as from January 1  2024 of HELLA’s joint-venture in Lighting in China for c. €250 million The impact of the first step  already announced  of the second €1 billion disposal program underway  i.e. the disposal by HELLA of its 50% stake in BHTC that should contribute cash proceeds estimated at c. €200 million.2024 guidance is on track to reach POWER25 ambition:Sales of between €27.5 billion and 28.5 billionOperating margin between 5.6% and 6.4% of salesNCF ≥ 2023 in valueNet debt/Adjusted EBITDA ratio ≤ 1.9x at Dec. 31  2024ON TRACK TO POWER25 AMBITIONThe Group reiterates its FY2025 objectives  as presented at the Capital Markets Day held in November 2022:Sales of c. €30bnOperating margin > 7% of salesNCF of 4% salesNet debt/Adjusted EBITDA ratio of < 1.5x at Dec. 31  2025These objectives were based on average 2025 currency rates of 1.05 for €/USD and of 7.00 for €/CNY and assumed no major disruption materially impacting production or retail sales in any major automotive region over the period.These objectives  evidently  did not take into consideration any impact from the second €1 billion disposal program that was announced in October 2023.FINANCIAL CALENDARMarch 21  2024 Sustainability Day in Paris (France)Sustainability Day in Paris (France) April 18

It corresponds to net income of fully consolidated companies before:Amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations; Other non-recurring operating income and expense  corresponding to material  unusual and non-recurring items including reorganization expenses and early retirement costs  the impact of exceptional events such as the discontinuation of a business  the closure or sale of an industrial site  disposals of non-operating buildings  impairment losses recorded for property  plant and equipment or intangible assets  as well as other material and unusual losses; Income on loans  cash investments and marketable securities; Finance costs; Other financial income and expense  which include the impact of discounting the pension benefit obligation and the return on related plan assets  the ineffective portion of interest rate and currency hedges  changes in value of interest rate and currency instruments for which the hedging relationship does not satisfy the criteria set forth in relationship cannot be demonstrated under IFRS 9  and gains and losses on sales of shares in subsidiaries; Taxes.Adjusted EBITDAAdjusted EBITDA is Operating income as defined above + depreciation and amortization of assets; to be fully compliant with the ESMA (European Securities and Markets Authority) regulation  this term of “Adjusted EBITDA” will be used by the Group as of January 1  2022 instead of the term “EBITDA” that was previously used (this means that “EBITDA” aggregates until 2021 are comparable with ‘Adjusted EBITDA” aggregates as from 2022).Net cash-flowNet cash-flow is defined as follow: Net cash from (used in) operating and investing activities less (acquisitions)/disposal of equity interests and businesses (net of cash and cash equivalents)  other changes and proceeds from disposal of financial assets. Repayment of IFRS 16 debt is not included.Net financial debtNet financial debt is defined as follow: Gross financial debt less cash and cash equivalents and derivatives classified under non-current and current assets. It includes the lease liabilities (IFRS 16 debt).Attachments",neutral,0.02,0.98,0.01,mixed,0.64,0.29,0.07,True,English,"['FULL YEAR RESULTS', 'S&P Global Mobility', 'first €1bn disposal program', 'second €1bn disposal program', 'first one-billion-euro disposal program', 'Net debt/Adjusted EBITDA ratio', 'growing worldwide automotive production', 'Cumulated net cost synergies', '1 BILLION NET DEBT REDUCTION', 'Strong net cash flow', 'Net debt/Adj.

We delivered on our priorities. We generated profitable growth through strong sales organic growth  outperforming the market by 430 basis points  notably driven by market share gains in China  and through an improvement of our operating margin by 100bps to 5.3% of sales. Synergies with HELLA  ahead of our roadmap  contributed to this performance  and we are confident that we can expect higher synergies than initially expected by 2025.We delivered on our top priority: further deleveraging the company after the acquisition of HELLA. We reduced our net debt by close to one billion euros over the year  thanks to the combination of strong cash generation and successful completion of the first one-billion-euro disposal program that was launched mid-2022.We also achieved key milestones in different domains. We significantly improved profitability in our Seating North America  Clarion Electronics and Lighting activities. We accelerated the development of our hydrogen business by welcoming Stellantis  a major OEM  as a new partner in Symbio and inaugurating new production units for tanks and fuel cells. Regarding sustainability  which is core to our strategy and innovation  we stand one year ahead of schedule on our targets for scopes 1 & 2. The creation of Materi’Act  a company dedicated to the development of sustainable materials  will help the Group reaching its scope 3 objective and CO 2 net-zero by 2045. Finally  we registered a strong and selective order intake of 31 billion euros  with profitability aligned with our Power25 targets and reduced upfront costs: this reflects the high attractiveness of our business  aligned with the industry megatrends.Let me thank FORVIA’s teams for all efforts they have deployed to achieve this 2023 solid performance.2024 will be another step forward on our Power25 trajectory. We will maintain strong focus on sustainable and profitable growth and accelerate deleveraging  thanks to our Manage by Cash program  as well as the second one-billion-euro disposal program that is already underway. We will also make sure to stay agile and take the necessary measures in the face of anticipated medium-term market evolution.Today  we announced our intention to launch “EU-FORWARD”  a project that is intended to be rolled out over the next five years to reinforce the competitiveness and agility of our operations in Europe and achieve significantly higher profitability. This objective is to be supported by FORVIA’s acceleration on Artificial Intelligence across the Group  aiming at optimizing R&D investment and costs as well as Program Management  while maintaining high level of technology and innovation. We keep building a stronger Group  able to compete in a fast-changing environment.”The 2023 consolidated financial statements have been approved by the Board of Directors at its meeting held on February 16  2024  under the chairmanship of Michel de ROSEN.These financial statements have been audited.All financial terms used in this press release are explained at the end of this document  under the section “Definitions of terms used in this document”.IFRS 5 – Discontinued operationsFaurecia’s SAS Cockpit Modules division (assembly and logistics services)  that was part of the Interiors Business Group and whose contemplated disposal was announced on February 19  2023  is presented as Discontinued Operations.All figures related to worldwide or regional automotive production refer to the S&P Global Mobility forecast dated February 2024.2023 KEY ACHIEVEMENTSSuccessful completion of the first €1bn disposal program launched in Q2 2022 (proceeds of c. €320m in 2022 and c. €700m in 2023) that contributed to close to €1bn net debt reduction in 2023(proceeds of c. €320m in 2022 and c. €700m in 2023) Launch of a second €1bn disposal program to accelerate deleveragingAt the end of Q3 2023  FORVIA had completed the first €1 billion disposal program launched in Q2 2022:c. €320 million were already cashed in 2022 mainly through the disposal by HELLA of its stake in the HBPO joint venture the remaining c. €700 million was cashed in 2023 through: (i) the sale of a 16.66% stake in Symbio to Stellantis  (ii) the sale of SAS Cockpit Modules division to the Motherson Group  and (iii) the sale of part of commercial vehicle exhaust gas aftertreatment business in Europe and in the United-States to Cummins.Thus  in less than 15 months  FORVIA has successfully achieved its target to fulfil its disposal program. All operations carried out under this program have strengthened the Group’s focus on its strategic priorities and were executed with good valuations.In October 2023  FORVIA announced the launch of a second €1 billion disposal program that will further simplify the Group’s portfolio  as well as accelerate deleveraging beyond the initial POWER25 objective.The first step of this second program is the disposal by HELLA of its 50% stake in BHTC  co-owned with MAHLE  which was already announced along with the launch of the second €1bn disposal program and represents a total enterprise value of c. €600m and cash proceeds to come estimated at c. €200 million for each of the two partners in the joint venture.Synergies with HELLA ahead of roadmap  with €190m of cumulated net cost synergies achieved at the end of 2023  and cumulated net cost synergies to be achieved at the end of 2025 upgraded to more than €350 million on an annual basis (from more than €300 million previously)In 2023  the pace of the combination with HELLA accelerated and cumulated cost synergies generated at the end of 2023 amounted to €190 million  ahead of roadmap. This figure is to be compared with €51 million at the end of 2022.This result was achieved through numerous projects in key areas  including procurements  freight  and SG&A. In July 2023  was created FH Services S.A.S.  a joint venture co-owned and co-managed by HELLA and FORVIA and designed to leverage the combined strengths of a shared organization  that will serve as the global provider of leading IT and Indirect Purchasing solutions to FORVIA’s collective 150 000 internal business users worldwide.Good progress since the start of the synergies program allows FORVIA to upgrade its previous target of reaching more than €300 million of cost synergies by 2025 to more than €350 million within the same timeframe.In 2023  as regards commercial synergies  FORVIA and HELLA made joint presentations for the first time at the CES in Las Vegas  then at the Shanghai Auto Show and at the IAA Mobility fair in Munich. That was again the case at the CES in Las Vegas that took place early January 2024.Strong and selective order intake of €31bn  with profitability aligned with POWER25 targets and reduced upfrontIn 2023  FORVIA recorded an order intake of €31 billion  a high level reflecting strong momentum of all its Business Groups.The order intake recorded in 2023 has an average operating margin aligned with the Group’s POWER25 objectives and will generate c. €300m savings versus initial upfront cost estimate.Accelerating transformation of the Group’s operations through the development of sustainable and innovative solutionsIn 2023  FORVIA improved it Sustainability ratings with MSCI to an A-rating and  early 2024  with CDP  also to an A-rating. The Group is also rated 11.3 by Sustainalytics (i.e. “low risk”).As regards its roadmap to net-zero  at the end of 2023  FORVIA stands one year ahead of schedule for scopes 1 & 2  with over 40% CO 2 reduction already achieved  a goal initially targeted for end-2024. FORVIA keeps committed to achieving CO2 neutrality for scopes 1 & 2 by end-2025 and to reduce scope 3 emissions by 45% by end-2030  before reaching net-zero all scopes by end-2045.In November 2023  Materi’Act  FORVIA’s company dedicated to the development  industrialization  and marketing of unique  cutting-edge materials with a low CO 2 footprint  inaugurated its headquarters and R&D center in Villeurbanne (France).This center brings together engineers  researchers  and data scientists  and is destined to become a world-class center of excellence  and one of Europe's leading centers in the field of materials with very low CO 2 footprint.In January 2024  FORVIA’s presence at the 2024 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas reflected innovation focused on sustainable mobility.Each of FORVIA’s demonstrators at the 2024 CEs was designed for Scope 3  in order to respond to the industry's technical and technological evolution while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In addition  FORVIA received 4 “Accolades” at the CES 2024 Innovation Awards in the category “Vehicle Tech & Advanced Mobility”.New milestones in FORVIA’s hydrogen strategyIn July 2023  Stellantis acquired an equal stake with FORVIA and Michelin in Symbio  a leader in zero-emission hydrogen mobility. The entry of a major OEM  Stellantis  in the joint venture that was previously co-owned (50/50) by FORVIA and Michelin will not only increase Symbio’s capabilities but will also accelerate and globalize Symbio’s growth to the benefit of its customers.Early October 2023  FORVIA inaugurated in Allenjoie (France) its first mass production plant of hydrogen storage tanks for mobility applications in Europe. This new site is sized to produce 100 000 tanks a year by 2030 and will reduce by five times its production costs between 2023 and 2025. The complete hydrogen storage systems produced at Allenjoie already equip commercial fleets of Stellantis (Opel Vivaro-e  Citroën e-Jumpy  Peugeot e-Expert) and Hyvia (Renault Master Van H2 Tech).Early December 2023  Symbio inaugurated in Saint-Fons (France) its first gigafactory SymphonHy  Europe's largest integrated site producing hydrogen fuel cells with a target to produce 50 000 fuel cell systems by 2026.This gigafactory is part of HyMotive  a strategic €1 billion project to develop disruptive technology  supported by the European Union and the French government as part of the IPCEI (Important Project of Scientific Interest) program.As regards significant hydrogen awards  it is worth mentioning two new contracts signed late 2023 in North America  whose production will start in 2025:A first one with a major automotive manufacturer to supply Type IV hydrogen storage systems for medium-duty commercial trucks A second one with a major clean energy technology company to supply Type IV hydrogen storage systems for heavy-duty commercial vehicles.Effective end of the loss-making Michigan JIT Seating program in North America  successful turnaround of Clarion Electronics  within the Electronics Business Group  and significant improvement in profitability of the Lighting Business GroupAs already mentioned in previous communications  FORVIA closed its Michigan Seating JIT (Just-In-Time) operations for the Jeep Grand Wagoneer at the end of September 2023 (the remaining part of this program having been transferred to FORVIA’s Seating plant in Monterrey  Mexico). The extra-costs generated by this program in the first nine months of 2023 still amounted to €30 million  an improvement of €50 million over the €80 million incurred in 2022. The movement of the program will contribute to further improve profitability of the Group’s North American Seating operations in 2024.In 2023  Clarion Electronics  the former Electronics activity of Faurecia before the acquisition of HELLA now combined within the Electronics Business Group of FORVIA  has successfully managed the turnaround of its operations. In H1 2023  these operations  representing about 25% of FORVIA’s Electronics Business Group  recorded an operating loss that mainly reflected high increase in freight costs to maintain supply of semiconductors and an unfavorable geographic mix. In H2 2023  thanks to gradual improvement of the supply chain and strong organic growth  Clarion Electronics was back to significant profit  more than compensating the loss recorded in H1.In 2023  the Lighting Business Group confirmed its recovery in operating margin to 5.1% of sales in 2023 (vs. 3.5% of sales in 2022)  tracking ahead of its POWER25 objective.2023 KEY FIGURESLight vehicle production reached 90 million in 2023  up 9.7% vs. 2022Worldwide automotive production showed strong dynamics in 2023  with a global production of 90.3 million light vehicles  corresponding to a 9.7% growth year on year.The market was supported by a robust global demand and gradual improvement of semi-conductor’s supply.The 2023 level exceeded the c. 89 million LV production reached in 2019 (pre-Covid level)  but with a different regional mix:In Europ e excl. Russia (45% of Group sales): production was up 12.7% at 16.7 million LVs  but it was c. 13% below the 2019 level of 19.2 million LVs (45% of Group sales): but it was of 19.2 million LVs  North America (24% of Group sales): production was up 9.7% at 15.7 million LVs  4% below the 2019 level of 16.3 million LVs (24% of Group sales): 4% below the 2019 level of 16.3 million LVs  China (21% of Group sales): production was up 10.0% at 28.8 million LVs  18% above the 2019 level of 24.4 million LVs.In 2023  China represented 32% of worldwide LVP (vs. 27% in 2019) and Europe represented 20% (vs. 24% in 2019).2023 Group consolidated sales and operating incomeGROUP (in €m) 2022* Currency Organic Scope 2023 Reported effect growth effect change Worldwide auto. production (m units) 82 344 90 321 9.7% Sales 24 574 -1 272 3 431 515 27 248 10.9% % of last year's sales -5.2% 14.0% 2.1% outperformance (bps) +430bps Operating income 1 061 1 439 35.6% 4.3% 5.3% +100bps * 2022 restated for SAS  presented as Discontinued operations as from Jan. 1  2022; HELLA fully consolidated as from Feb.1  20222023 consolidated sales of €27 248 million: +10.9% on a reported basis and +14.0% on an organic basis  representing an outperformance of +430bpsOrganic growth of €3 431 million or +14.0% of last year’s sales  represented a solid outperformance of +430bps compared to worldwide automotive production that was up 9.4% during the period.Out of the +430bps  +250bps came from volumes  +80bps from inflation pass-through and +100bps from a favorable regional mix.The end of the JIT part of the Michigan program at the end of Q3 2023 represented lost sales of c. €55 million in Q4 2023 vs. Q4 2022 and the UAW strike in the US represented lost sales of c. €90 million  mostly in Q4 2023 vs. Q4 2022.Positive scope effect of €515 million or +2.1% of last year’s sales  corresponded to the combined effect of: One additional month of consolidation of HELLA (consolidation started on February 1  2022) for €617 million  A quarter of deconsolidation of the CVI business sold to Cummins (end of consolidation as from September 30  2023) for €(102) million.Negative currency effect of €1 272 million or -5.2% of last year’s sales  was mainly due to the depreciation of the US dollar  the Chinese yuan  the Turkish lira  and the Argentinean peso vs. the euro.All Business Groups recorded an organic growth in the double-digits.2023 consolidated operating income of €1 439 million  up 100bps to 5.3% of salesThe year-on-year net increase mainly reflected on the positive side…Volume/mix effect for an estimated impact of €390 million  Acceleration in cost synergies related to the integration of HELLA for a year-on-year positive impact of €139 million (€190 million of cumulated net synergies at the end of 2023 vs. €51 million at the end of 2022)  Sequential year-on-year reduction of extra-costs from the Seating program in Michigan  leading to a net positive impact of €50 million (€30 million extra-costs in the first nine months of 2023 vs. €80 million in 2022)  The contribution of one additional month of consolidation of HELLA for €38 million …and on the negative side:A currency impact of €138 million  close to half of which being related to the devaluation of the Argentinian person and the Turkish lira  Net inflation cost for an estimated year-on-year impact of €75 million  The impact of the UAW strike in the US (mostly in Q4 2023) of €18 million.2023 SALES AND PROFITABILITY BY BUSINESS GROUPSEATING (31% of Group consolidated sales in the period): Improved performance but margin below potentialSEATING (in €m) 2022 Currency Organic 2023 Reported effect growth change Worldwide auto. production (m units) 82 344 90 321 9.7% Sales 7 704 -404 1 251 8 551 11.0% % of last year's sales -5.2% 16.2% outperformance (bps) +650bps Operating income 197 315 59.7% 2.6% 3.7% +110bpsSalesStrong organic sales outperformance of 650bps was driven by: Strong organic sales growth of close to +30% in China  driven by buoyant activity with BYD  Li Auto  a major US EV car maker and BMW  Solid organic sales growth of c. +14% in Europe  mainly related to major German OEMs.Operating incomeOperating margin of 3.7%  up 110bps vs. 2022  was mostly driven by the improvement of Seating North American operations and the positive regional mix effect related to strong sales growth in China It included the positive year-on-year impact from the reduction by €50 million of the extra-costs related to the Michigan program (€30 million extra-costs in the first nine months of 2023 vs. €80 million in 2022). As a reminder  after having reached an agreement with the OEM related to this project  FORVIA came out of the JIT part of this program  that was loss-making  at the end of Q3 2023. It also included a positive regional mix impact  as activity in China grew strongly and is accretive to operating margin  Conversely  operating margin was penalized by inflation headwinds in JIT operations and structural overcapacities in Europe.INTERIORS (18% of Group consolidated sales in the period): Profitability penalized by European operationsINTERIORS (in €m) 2022* Currency Organic 2023 Reported effect growth change Worldwide auto. production (m units) 82 344 90 321 9.7% Sales 4 645 -258 536 4 923 6.0% % of last year's sales -5.6% 11.5% outperformance (bps) +180bps Operating income 191 201 5.0% 4.1% 4.1% stable * Restated for SAS (part of the ""Interiors"" Business Group)  presented as Discontinued operations as from January 1  2022SalesSolid organic sales outperformance of 180bps was mainly driven by: Organic sales growth in Europe of +22%  mainly Ford  JLR and RNM  Organic sales growth in China of +20%  mainly Chang’an and Li Auto.Operating incomeOperating margin of 4.1%  stable vs. 2022.

EBITDA ratio improvement reflect that FORVIA is fully in line with its commitment to rapidly deleverage the company  after the acquisition of HELLA.AVAILABLE LIQUIDITY OF €6.2 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31  2023As of December 31  2023  Group liquidity amounted to €6.2billion  of which €4.3 billion of available cash  €1.5 billion from the fully undrawn FORVIA Senior Credit Facility and €450 million from the fully undrawn HELLA Senior Credit Facility.FORVIA’s proactive debt management actions in 2023 included:Extension of the maturity of close to the entirety of the €1.5 billion Senior Credit Facility by one year to May 2027 (with options up to May 2028) Refinancing of the €500 million line now maturing June 2026 (with two possible extensions by one year each) Refinancing of a €150 million term loan till June 2025 Purchase back of €150 million out of a €950 million SLB Bonds due 2026 at 7.25% Issuance of Samurai Bonds for JPY19.2 million (c. €120 million)  allocated across three tranches (2.25 years  3.25 years and 5 years).Between August and November 2023  all three rating agencies have upgraded their outlook from negative to stable.LAUNCH OF “EU-FORWARD”  A FIVE-YEAR PROJECT TO REINFORCE THE COMPETITIVENESS AND AGILITY OF THE GROUP’S OPERATIONS IN EUROPEWhile the European automotive market does not offer volume dynamics in the coming years and remains significantly below its 2019 level  it still represents the largest market for the Group with EMEA at 46% of sales in 2023  but only 22% of operating income.Between 2019 and 2023:European production fell by 16% from 21.2 million light vehicles (19.2 million  excluding Russia) to 17.9 million light vehicles (16.7 million  excluding Russia)  while production in Asia grew by 12% from 46.2 million light vehicles (of which 24.4 million in China) to 51.6 million light vehicles (of which 28.8 million in China) Consequently  the share of Europe within worldwide automotive production fell from 24% to 20% and the share of Asia gained 5 percentage points from 52% in 2019 to 57% in 2023 (including China  whose share also gained 5 percentage points from 27% to 32%).In addition  latest forecasts anticipate almost no growth between 2023 and 2030 in European automotive production  while they anticipate production in the rest of the world to grow by c. 9% during the same period.During the same 2019-2023 period:The share of EMEA within FORVIA’s sales fell from 50% in 2019 (before the acquisition of HELLA) to 46% in 2023 The operating margin of FORVIA’s operations in the region fell from 6.6% (before the acquisition of HELLA and in a pre-Covid/non-inflationary environment) to 2.5% in 2023 (after the acquisition of HELLA and in a post-Covid/inflationary environment).In front of this evolution  FORVIA needs to take appropriate measures to reinforce the competitiveness and agility of its European operations (including addressing structural overcapacities) and achieve significantly higher profitability. This would rebalance the contribution of the different regions to the Group’s operating income  thus reducing the Group’s dependency to China  while continuing to grow in this region.FORVIA announces today its intention to launch a project  named “EU-FORWARD”  of which the FORVIA European Committee bureau is informed today.This project has the objectives to:Adapt the Group’s operations to the fast-changing environment  including ICE-ban schedule in Europe that obliges the entire industry to adapt its structure and costs to the evolving regulation Be ready for an evolution of the customer landscape  with the arrival of newcomers from Asia Improve FORVIA’s profitability in the region  thus rebalancing FORVIA’s regional mix in terms of contribution to the Group’s performance.The project should be rolled-out across the Group’s European operations and run over a period of five years  from 2024 to 2028.Over this period  the Group intends to concentrate its efforts on the adaptation of the regional manufacturing and R&D set-up to the new European environment  through benefiting from generative AI adoption and addressing structural overcapacities.This project could impact up to 10 000 jobs over the five- year period (to be compared with c. 75 500 at end-2023) and should need incremental restructuring costs:From a P&L standpoint   restructuring charge dedicated to Europe over the 2024-2028 period should be upgraded by c. 50% to c. €1 billion  broadly equally split between the 2024-2025 period and the 2026-2028 period   restructuring charge dedicated to Europe over the 2024-2028 period should be upgraded by c. 50% to c. €1 billion  broadly equally split between the 2024-2025 period and the 2026-2028 period  From a cash standpoint   restructuring outflow dedicated to Europe over the 2024-2028 period should be upgraded by c. 50% to c. €800 million  also broadly equally split between the 2024-2025 period and the 2026-2028 period.Expected savings should reach c. €500 million on an annual basis in 2028.At Group level:Total P&L restructuring charge should amount to close to 1 billion euros  broadly equally split between the 2024 period and the 2026-2028 period Total cash restructurings for the Group should amount to close to 1.2 billion euros  also broadly equally split between the 2024 period and the 2026-2028 period.To minimize as much as possible the impact of employment at the 2028 horizon  on top of natural attrition  FORVIA is targeting immediately and drastically reducing recruitment in Europe  adapting the level of non-permanent employment  and strongly reducing the usage of external R&D resources.Through the implementation of this project  FORVIA would significantly enhance the sustainable competitiveness of its operations in EMEA and targets by 2028:To achieve significantly higher profitability exceeding 7% of sales in the region (vs. 2.5% of sales in 2023) To rebalance the Group’s regional mix with EMEA representing c. 40% of sales in 2028 (vs. 46% in 2023) and c. 35% of operating income (vs. 22% in 2023).This goal will be supported by the deployment of a global initiative named “AI/GenAI TRANSFORMATION” aiming at optimizing R&D investment and costs as well as Program Management  while maintaining high level of technology and innovationLeveraging on the huge potential offered by AI and GenAI  FORVIA will accelerate on innovation at lower cost and increased efficiency.Actions will include:Dedicated AI teams in every Business Group and one central Group platform Ensure best-in-class data management and IT environment to enable AI solutions.More than 250 most promising AI uses cases will be promoted and prioritized across the Group  not only for R&D but also for Program Management  and high benefit use cases will be driven at scale.The ambition of this project is to achieve up to 50% of efficiency gains on R&D and core teams.PROPOSED DIVIDEND OF €0.50 PER SHAREAt its latest meeting held on February 16  2024  the Board of Directors decided to propose at the next Annual Shareholders’ Meeting to be held in Nanterre (France) on May 30  2024  the payment of a dividend of €0.50 per share to be paid in cash.This dividend:Is consistent with the POWER25 plan’s commitment to reinstate dividend as from 2024  as deleveraging has significantly accelerated in 2023 Reflects the Group’s confidence in its capability to generate sustainable profit growth and enhanced cash flow in the coming years.The proposed amount  below the stated dividend policy  reconciles the Group’s willingness to reward its shareholders  after two years of dividend payment suspension  with that of pursuing accelerated deleveraging and financing transformative projects to further enhance the Group’s competitiveness.2024 GUIDANCEThis guidance is based on:Broadly stable worldwide automotive production in 2024 vs. 2023  in line with S&P’s latest forecast dated February 2024 that estimates 90.0 million light vehicles produced in 2024 vs. 90.3 million in 2023 (-0.4%) Average 2024 currency rates of 1.10 for €/USD and of 7.50 for €/CNY and assumes no major disruption materially impacting production or retail sales in any automotive region during the year.It takes into consideration:A limited negative scope effect on sales of c. €50 million as the net effect of the disposal of the CVI business to Cummins (deconsolidated as from Q4 2023) for €(300) million largely offset by the consolidation as from January 1  2024 of HELLA’s joint-venture in Lighting in China for c. €250 million The impact of the first step  already announced  of the second €1 billion disposal program underway  i.e. the disposal by HELLA of its 50% stake in BHTC that should contribute cash proceeds estimated at c. €200 million.2024 guidance is on track to reach POWER25 ambition:Sales of between €27.5 billion and 28.5 billionOperating margin between 5.6% and 6.4% of salesNCF ≥ 2023 in valueNet debt/Adjusted EBITDA ratio ≤ 1.9x at Dec. 31  2024ON TRACK TO POWER25 AMBITIONThe Group reiterates its FY2025 objectives  as presented at the Capital Markets Day held in November 2022:Sales of c. €30bnOperating margin > 7% of salesNCF of 4% salesNet debt/Adjusted EBITDA ratio of < 1.5x at Dec. 31  2025These objectives were based on average 2025 currency rates of 1.05 for €/USD and of 7.00 for €/CNY and assumed no major disruption materially impacting production or retail sales in any major automotive region over the period.These objectives  evidently  did not take into consideration any impact from the second €1 billion disposal program that was announced in October 2023.FINANCIAL CALENDARMarch 21  2024 Sustainability Day in Paris (France)Sustainability Day in Paris (France) April 18

It corresponds to net income of fully consolidated companies before:Amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations; Other non-recurring operating income and expense  corresponding to material  unusual and non-recurring items including reorganization expenses and early retirement costs  the impact of exceptional events such as the discontinuation of a business  the closure or sale of an industrial site  disposals of non-operating buildings  impairment losses recorded for property  plant and equipment or intangible assets  as well as other material and unusual losses; Income on loans  cash investments and marketable securities; Finance costs; Other financial income and expense  which include the impact of discounting the pension benefit obligation and the return on related plan assets  the ineffective portion of interest rate and currency hedges  changes in value of interest rate and currency instruments for which the hedging relationship does not satisfy the criteria set forth in relationship cannot be demonstrated under IFRS 9  and gains and losses on sales of shares in subsidiaries; Taxes.Adjusted EBITDAAdjusted EBITDA is Operating income as defined above + depreciation and amortization of assets; to be fully compliant with the ESMA (European Securities and Markets Authority) regulation  this term of “Adjusted EBITDA” will be used by the Group as of January 1  2022 instead of the term “EBITDA” that was previously used (this means that “EBITDA” aggregates until 2021 are comparable with ‘Adjusted EBITDA” aggregates as from 2022).Net cash-flowNet cash-flow is defined as follow: Net cash from (used in) operating and investing activities less (acquisitions)/disposal of equity interests and businesses (net of cash and cash equivalents)  other changes and proceeds from disposal of financial assets. Repayment of IFRS 16 debt is not included.Net financial debtNet financial debt is defined as follow: Gross financial debt less cash and cash equivalents and derivatives classified under non-current and current assets. It includes the lease liabilities (IFRS 16 debt).Attachment",neutral,0.02,0.59,0.39,mixed,0.64,0.29,0.07,True,English,"['FULL YEAR RESULTS', 'typo page', 'Correction', 'table', 'S&P Global Mobility', 'first €1bn disposal program', 'second €1bn disposal program', 'first one-billion-euro disposal program', 'Net debt/Adjusted EBITDA ratio', 'growing worldwide automotive production', 'Cumulated net cost synergies', '1 BILLION NET DEBT REDUCTION', 'Strong net cash flow', 'Net debt/Adj.

We delivered on our priorities. We generated profitable growth through strong sales organic growth  outperforming the market by 430 basis points  notably driven by market share gains in China  and through an improvement of our operating margin by 100bps to 5.3% of sales. Synergies with HELLA  ahead of our roadmap  contributed to this performance  and we are confident that we can expect higher synergies than initially expected by 2025.We delivered on our top priority: further deleveraging the company after the acquisition of HELLA. We reduced our net debt by close to one billion euros over the year  thanks to the combination of strong cash generation and successful completion of the first one-billion-euro disposal program that was launched mid-2022.We also achieved key milestones in different domains. We significantly improved profitability in our Seating North America  Clarion Electronics and Lighting activities. We accelerated the development of our hydrogen business by welcoming Stellantis  a major OEM  as a new partner in Symbio and inaugurating new production units for tanks and fuel cells. Regarding sustainability  which is core to our strategy and innovation  we stand one year ahead of schedule on our targets for scopes 1 & 2. The creation of Materi’Act  a company dedicated to the development of sustainable materials  will help the Group reaching its scope 3 objective and CO 2 net-zero by 2045. Finally  we registered a strong and selective order intake of 31 billion euros  with profitability aligned with our Power25 targets and reduced upfront costs: this reflects the high attractiveness of our business  aligned with the industry megatrends.Let me thank FORVIA’s teams for all efforts they have deployed to achieve this 2023 solid performance.2024 will be another step forward on our Power25 trajectory. We will maintain strong focus on sustainable and profitable growth and accelerate deleveraging  thanks to our Manage by Cash program  as well as the second one-billion-euro disposal program that is already underway. We will also make sure to stay agile and take the necessary measures in the face of anticipated medium-term market evolution.Today  we announced our intention to launch “EU-FORWARD”  a project that is intended to be rolled out over the next five years to reinforce the competitiveness and agility of our operations in Europe and achieve significantly higher profitability. This objective is to be supported by FORVIA’s acceleration on Artificial Intelligence across the Group  aiming at optimizing R&D investment and costs as well as Program Management  while maintaining high level of technology and innovation. We keep building a stronger Group  able to compete in a fast-changing environment.”The 2023 consolidated financial statements have been approved by the Board of Directors at its meeting held on February 16  2024  under the chairmanship of Michel de ROSEN.These financial statements have been audited.All financial terms used in this press release are explained at the end of this document  under the section “Definitions of terms used in this document”.IFRS 5 – Discontinued operationsFaurecia’s SAS Cockpit Modules division (assembly and logistics services)  that was part of the Interiors Business Group and whose contemplated disposal was announced on February 19  2023  is presented as Discontinued Operations.All figures related to worldwide or regional automotive production refer to the S&P Global Mobility forecast dated February 2024.2023 KEY ACHIEVEMENTSSuccessful completion of the first €1bn disposal program launched in Q2 2022 (proceeds of c. €320m in 2022 and c. €700m in 2023) that contributed to close to €1bn net debt reduction in 2023(proceeds of c. €320m in 2022 and c. €700m in 2023) Launch of a second €1bn disposal program to accelerate deleveragingAt the end of Q3 2023  FORVIA had completed the first €1 billion disposal program launched in Q2 2022:c. €320 million were already cashed in 2022 mainly through the disposal by HELLA of its stake in the HBPO joint venture the remaining c. €700 million was cashed in 2023 through: (i) the sale of a 16.66% stake in Symbio to Stellantis  (ii) the sale of SAS Cockpit Modules division to the Motherson Group  and (iii) the sale of part of commercial vehicle exhaust gas aftertreatment business in Europe and in the United-States to Cummins.Thus  in less than 15 months  FORVIA has successfully achieved its target to fulfil its disposal program. All operations carried out under this program have strengthened the Group’s focus on its strategic priorities and were executed with good valuations.In October 2023  FORVIA announced the launch of a second €1 billion disposal program that will further simplify the Group’s portfolio  as well as accelerate deleveraging beyond the initial POWER25 objective.The first step of this second program is the disposal by HELLA of its 50% stake in BHTC  co-owned with MAHLE  which was already announced along with the launch of the second €1bn disposal program and represents a total enterprise value of c. €600m and cash proceeds to come estimated at c. €200 million for each of the two partners in the joint venture.Synergies with HELLA ahead of roadmap  with €190m of cumulated net cost synergies achieved at the end of 2023  and cumulated net cost synergies to be achieved at the end of 2025 upgraded to more than €350 million on an annual basis (from more than €300 million previously)In 2023  the pace of the combination with HELLA accelerated and cumulated cost synergies generated at the end of 2023 amounted to €190 million  ahead of roadmap. This figure is to be compared with €51 million at the end of 2022.This result was achieved through numerous projects in key areas  including procurements  freight  and SG&A. In July 2023  was created FH Services S.A.S.  a joint venture co-owned and co-managed by HELLA and FORVIA and designed to leverage the combined strengths of a shared organization  that will serve as the global provider of leading IT and Indirect Purchasing solutions to FORVIA’s collective 150 000 internal business users worldwide.Good progress since the start of the synergies program allows FORVIA to upgrade its previous target of reaching more than €300 million of cost synergies by 2025 to more than €350 million within the same timeframe.In 2023  as regards commercial synergies  FORVIA and HELLA made joint presentations for the first time at the CES in Las Vegas  then at the Shanghai Auto Show and at the IAA Mobility fair in Munich. That was again the case at the CES in Las Vegas that took place early January 2024.Strong and selective order intake of €31bn  with profitability aligned with POWER25 targets and reduced upfrontIn 2023  FORVIA recorded an order intake of €31 billion  a high level reflecting strong momentum of all its Business Groups.The order intake recorded in 2023 has an average operating margin aligned with the Group’s POWER25 objectives and will generate c. €300m savings versus initial upfront cost estimate.Accelerating transformation of the Group’s operations through the development of sustainable and innovative solutionsIn 2023  FORVIA improved it Sustainability ratings with MSCI to an A-rating and  early 2024  with CDP  also to an A-rating. The Group is also rated 11.3 by Sustainalytics (i.e. “low risk”).As regards its roadmap to net-zero  at the end of 2023  FORVIA stands one year ahead of schedule for scopes 1 & 2  with over 40% CO 2 reduction already achieved  a goal initially targeted for end-2024. FORVIA keeps committed to achieving CO2 neutrality for scopes 1 & 2 by end-2025 and to reduce scope 3 emissions by 45% by end-2030  before reaching net-zero all scopes by end-2045.In November 2023  Materi’Act  FORVIA’s company dedicated to the development  industrialization  and marketing of unique  cutting-edge materials with a low CO 2 footprint  inaugurated its headquarters and R&D center in Villeurbanne (France).This center brings together engineers  researchers  and data scientists  and is destined to become a world-class center of excellence  and one of Europe's leading centers in the field of materials with very low CO 2 footprint.In January 2024  FORVIA’s presence at the 2024 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas reflected innovation focused on sustainable mobility.Each of FORVIA’s demonstrators at the 2024 CEs was designed for Scope 3  in order to respond to the industry's technical and technological evolution while reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In addition  FORVIA received 4 “Accolades” at the CES 2024 Innovation Awards in the category “Vehicle Tech & Advanced Mobility”.New milestones in FORVIA’s hydrogen strategyIn July 2023  Stellantis acquired an equal stake with FORVIA and Michelin in Symbio  a leader in zero-emission hydrogen mobility. The entry of a major OEM  Stellantis  in the joint venture that was previously co-owned (50/50) by FORVIA and Michelin will not only increase Symbio’s capabilities but will also accelerate and globalize Symbio’s growth to the benefit of its customers.Early October 2023  FORVIA inaugurated in Allenjoie (France) its first mass production plant of hydrogen storage tanks for mobility applications in Europe. This new site is sized to produce 100 000 tanks a year by 2030 and will reduce by five times its production costs between 2023 and 2025. The complete hydrogen storage systems produced at Allenjoie already equip commercial fleets of Stellantis (Opel Vivaro-e  Citroën e-Jumpy  Peugeot e-Expert) and Hyvia (Renault Master Van H2 Tech).Early December 2023  Symbio inaugurated in Saint-Fons (France) its first gigafactory SymphonHy  Europe's largest integrated site producing hydrogen fuel cells with a target to produce 50 000 fuel cell systems by 2026.This gigafactory is part of HyMotive  a strategic €1 billion project to develop disruptive technology  supported by the European Union and the French government as part of the IPCEI (Important Project of Scientific Interest) program.As regards significant hydrogen awards  it is worth mentioning two new contracts signed late 2023 in North America  whose production will start in 2025:A first one with a major automotive manufacturer to supply Type IV hydrogen storage systems for medium-duty commercial trucks A second one with a major clean energy technology company to supply Type IV hydrogen storage systems for heavy-duty commercial vehicles.Effective end of the loss-making Michigan JIT Seating program in North America  successful turnaround of Clarion Electronics  within the Electronics Business Group  and significant improvement in profitability of the Lighting Business GroupAs already mentioned in previous communications  FORVIA closed its Michigan Seating JIT (Just-In-Time) operations for the Jeep Grand Wagoneer at the end of September 2023 (the remaining part of this program having been transferred to FORVIA’s Seating plant in Monterrey  Mexico). The extra-costs generated by this program in the first nine months of 2023 still amounted to €30 million  an improvement of €50 million over the €80 million incurred in 2022. The movement of the program will contribute to further improve profitability of the Group’s North American Seating operations in 2024.In 2023  Clarion Electronics  the former Electronics activity of Faurecia before the acquisition of HELLA now combined within the Electronics Business Group of FORVIA  has successfully managed the turnaround of its operations. In H1 2023  these operations  representing about 25% of FORVIA’s Electronics Business Group  recorded an operating loss that mainly reflected high increase in freight costs to maintain supply of semiconductors and an unfavorable geographic mix. In H2 2023  thanks to gradual improvement of the supply chain and strong organic growth  Clarion Electronics was back to significant profit  more than compensating the loss recorded in H1.In 2023  the Lighting Business Group confirmed its recovery in operating margin to 5.1% of sales in 2023 (vs. 3.5% of sales in 2022)  tracking ahead of its POWER25 objective.2023 KEY FIGURESLight vehicle production reached 90 million in 2023  up 9.7% vs. 2022Worldwide automotive production showed strong dynamics in 2023  with a global production of 90.3 million light vehicles  corresponding to a 9.7% growth year on year.The market was supported by a robust global demand and gradual improvement of semi-conductor’s supply.The 2023 level exceeded the c. 89 million LV production reached in 2019 (pre-Covid level)  but with a different regional mix:In Europ e excl.

Change in factoring was an inflow of €111 million (vs. an inflow of €183 million in 2022 that reflected the extension of factoring program to HELLA): this inflow mostly reflected the redistribution of SAS outstanding factoring to the rest of the Group  and at year-end 2023 total factoring amounted to €1 292 million  in line with the commitment to cap the use of factoring to c. €1.3 billion.(vs. an inflow of €183 million in 2022 that reflected the extension of factoring program to HELLA): this inflow mostly reflected the redistribution of SAS outstanding factoring to the rest of the Group  and at year-end 2023 total factoring amounted to €1 292 million  in line with the commitment to cap the use of factoring to c. €1.3 billion. Restructuring cash-out amounted to €170 million (vs. €182 million in 2022)  financial expenses cash-out amounted to €529 million (vs. €362 million in 2022)  mainly reflecting the increase in net debt related to the acquisition of HELLA  and tax cash-out amounted to €515 million (vs. €362 million in 2022) that included a withholding tax of €69 million related to the extraordinary dividend received from HELLA with respect to the sale of its stake in HBPO  which is expected to reverse in 2024.Net cash flow increased by 34.3% to €649 million  representing 2.4% of sales (vs. €483 million in 2022).Dividends paid including to minorities amounted to €133 million (vs. €55 million in 2022) and included the extraordinary dividend paid to HELLA’s minority shareholders.Net financial investment and other was an inflow of €567 million  reflecting: Above €700m cash proceeds related to the completion of the first €1 billion disposal program The termination of the SAS factoring program for €(108) million Limited investments in small acquisitions.IFRS16 negative impact amounted to €131 million (vs. €310 million in 2022)  reduced year-on-year for fewer new large projects and disposals (mainly SAS).As a result  net financial debt at year-end 2023 stood at €6 987 million vs. €7 939 million at year-end 2022  a reduction of close to €1 billion.Net debt/Adj. EBITDA ratio at year-end 2023 stood at 2.1x  significantly reduced vs. 2.7x a year ago  and 100bps below the 3.1x ratio recorded 18 months ago  as of June 30  2022  right after the impact of the acquisition of HELLA.Net financial debt reduction and net debt/Adj. EBITDA ratio improvement reflect that FORVIA is fully in line with its commitment to rapidly deleverage the company  after the acquisition of HELLA.AVAILABLE LIQUIDITY OF €6.2 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31  2023As of December 31  2023  Group liquidity amounted to €6.2billion  of which €4.3 billion of available cash  €1.5 billion from the fully undrawn FORVIA Senior Credit Facility and €450 million from the fully undrawn HELLA Senior Credit Facility.FORVIA’s proactive debt management actions in 2023 included:Extension of the maturity of close to the entirety of the €1.5 billion Senior Credit Facility by one year to May 2027 (with options up to May 2028) Refinancing of the €500 million line now maturing June 2026 (with two possible extensions by one year each) Refinancing of a €150 million term loan till June 2025 Purchase back of €150 million out of a €950 million SLB Bonds due 2026 at 7.25% Issuance of Samurai Bonds for JPY19.2 million (c. €120 million)  allocated across three tranches (2.25 years  3.25 years and 5 years).Between August and November 2023  all three rating agencies have upgraded their outlook from negative to stable.LAUNCH OF “EU-FORWARD”  A FIVE-YEAR PROJECT TO REINFORCE THE COMPETITIVENESS AND AGILITY OF THE GROUP’S OPERATIONS IN EUROPEWhile the European automotive market does not offer volume dynamics in the coming years and remains significantly below its 2019 level  it still represents the largest market for the Group with EMEA at 46% of sales in 2023  but only 22% of operating income.Between 2019 and 2023:European production fell by 16% from 21.2 million light vehicles (19.2 million  excluding Russia) to 17.9 million light vehicles (16.7 million  excluding Russia)  while production in Asia grew by 12% from 46.2 million light vehicles (of which 24.4 million in China) to 51.6 million light vehicles (of which 28.8 million in China) Consequently  the share of Europe within worldwide automotive production fell from 24% to 20% and the share of Asia gained 5 percentage points from 52% in 2019 to 57% in 2023 (including China  whose share also gained 5 percentage points from 27% to 32%).In addition  latest forecasts anticipate almost no growth between 2023 and 2030 in European automotive production  while they anticipate production in the rest of the world to grow by c. 9% during the same period.During the same 2019-2023 period:The share of EMEA within FORVIA’s sales fell from 50% in 2019 (before the acquisition of HELLA) to 46% in 2023 The operating margin of FORVIA’s operations in the region fell from 6.6% (before the acquisition of HELLA and in a pre-Covid/non-inflationary environment) to 2.5% in 2023 (after the acquisition of HELLA and in a post-Covid/inflationary environment).In front of this evolution  FORVIA needs to take appropriate measures to reinforce the competitiveness and agility of its European operations (including addressing structural overcapacities) and achieve significantly higher profitability. This would rebalance the contribution of the different regions to the Group’s operating income  thus reducing the Group’s dependency to China  while continuing to grow in this region.FORVIA announces today its intention to launch a project  named “EU-FORWARD”  of which the FORVIA European Committee bureau is informed today.This project has the objectives to:Adapt the Group’s operations to the fast-changing environment  including ICE-ban schedule in Europe that obliges the entire industry to adapt its structure and costs to the evolving regulation Be ready for an evolution of the customer landscape  with the arrival of newcomers from Asia Improve FORVIA’s profitability in the region  thus rebalancing FORVIA’s regional mix in terms of contribution to the Group’s performance.The project should be rolled-out across the Group’s European operations and run over a period of five years  from 2024 to 2028.Over this period  the Group intends to concentrate its efforts on the adaptation of the regional manufacturing and R&D set-up to the new European environment  through benefiting from generative AI adoption and addressing structural overcapacities.This project could impact up to 10 000 jobs over the five- year period (to be compared with c. 75 500 at end-2023) and should need incremental restructuring costs:From a P&L standpoint   restructuring charge dedicated to Europe over the 2024-2028 period should be upgraded by c. 50% to c. €1 billion  broadly equally split between the 2024-2025 period and the 2026-2028 period   restructuring charge dedicated to Europe over the 2024-2028 period should be upgraded by c. 50% to c. €1 billion  broadly equally split between the 2024-2025 period and the 2026-2028 period  From a cash standpoint   restructuring outflow dedicated to Europe over the 2024-2028 period should be upgraded by c. 50% to c. €800 million  also broadly equally split between the 2024-2025 period and the 2026-2028 period.Expected savings should reach c. €500 million on an annual basis in 2028.At Group level:Total P&L restructuring charge should amount to close to 1.2 billion euros  broadly equally split between the 2024 period and the 2026-2028 period Total cash restructurings for the Group should amount to close to 1 billion euros  also broadly equally split between the 2024 period and the 2026-2028 period.To minimize as much as possible the impact of employment at the 2028 horizon  on top of natural attrition  FORVIA is targeting immediately and drastically reducing recruitment in Europe  adapting the level of non-permanent employment  and strongly reducing the usage of external R&D resources.Through the implementation of this project  FORVIA would significantly enhance the sustainable competitiveness of its operations in EMEA and targets by 2028:To achieve significantly higher profitability exceeding 7% of sales in the region (vs. 2.5% of sales in 2023) To rebalance the Group’s regional mix with EMEA representing c. 40% of sales in 2028 (vs. 46% in 2023) and c. 35% of operating income (vs. 22% in 2023).This goal will be supported by the deployment of a global initiative named “AI/GenAI TRANSFORMATION” aiming at optimizing R&D investment and costs as well as Program Management  while maintaining high level of technology and innovationLeveraging on the huge potential offered by AI and GenAI  FORVIA will accelerate on innovation at lower cost and increased efficiency.Actions will include:Dedicated AI teams in every Business Group and one central Group platform Ensure best-in-class data management and IT environment to enable AI solutions.More than 250 most promising AI uses cases will be promoted and prioritized across the Group  not only for R&D but also for Program Management  and high benefit use cases will be driven at scale.The ambition of this project is to achieve up to 50% of efficiency gains on R&D and core teams.PROPOSED DIVIDEND OF €0.50 PER SHAREAt its latest meeting held on February 16  2024  the Board of Directors decided to propose at the next Annual Shareholders’ Meeting to be held in Nanterre (France) on May 30  2024  the payment of a dividend of €0.50 per share to be paid in cash.This dividend:Is consistent with the POWER25 plan’s commitment to reinstate dividend as from 2024  as deleveraging has significantly accelerated in 2023 Reflects the Group’s confidence in its capability to generate sustainable profit growth and enhanced cash flow in the coming years.The proposed amount  below the stated dividend policy  reconciles the Group’s willingness to reward its shareholders  after two years of dividend payment suspension  with that of pursuing accelerated deleveraging and financing transformative projects to further enhance the Group’s competitiveness.2024 GUIDANCEThis guidance is based on:Broadly stable worldwide automotive production in 2024 vs. 2023  in line with S&P’s latest forecast dated February 2024 that estimates 90.0 million light vehicles produced in 2024 vs. 90.3 million in 2023 (-0.4%) Average 2024 currency rates of 1.10 for €/USD and of 7.50 for €/CNY and assumes no major disruption materially impacting production or retail sales in any automotive region during the year.It takes into consideration:A limited negative scope effect on sales of c. €50 million as the net effect of the disposal of the CVI business to Cummins (deconsolidated as from Q4 2023) for €(300) million largely offset by the consolidation as from January 1  2024 of HELLA’s joint-venture in Lighting in China for c. €250 million The impact of the first step  already announced  of the second €1 billion disposal program underway  i.e. the disposal by HELLA of its 50% stake in BHTC that should contribute cash proceeds estimated at c. €200 million.2024 guidance is on track to reach POWER25 ambition:Sales of between €27.5 billion and 28.5 billionOperating margin between 5.6% and 6.4% of salesNCF ≥ 2023 in valueNet debt/Adjusted EBITDA ratio ≤ 1.9x at Dec. 31  2024ON TRACK TO POWER25 AMBITIONThe Group reiterates its FY2025 objectives  as presented at the Capital Markets Day held in November 2022:Sales of c. €30bnOperating margin > 7% of salesNCF of 4% salesNet debt/Adjusted EBITDA ratio of < 1.5x at Dec. 31  2025These objectives were based on average 2025 currency rates of 1.05 for €/USD and of 7.00 for €/CNY and assumed no major disruption materially impacting production or retail sales in any major automotive region over the period.These objectives  evidently  did not take into consideration any impact from the second €1 billion disposal program that was announced in October 2023.FINANCIAL CALENDARMarch 21  2024 Sustainability Day in Paris (France)Sustainability Day in Paris (France) April 18

It corresponds to net income of fully consolidated companies before:Amortization of intangible assets acquired in business combinations; Other non-recurring operating income and expense  corresponding to material  unusual and non-recurring items including reorganization expenses and early retirement costs  the impact of exceptional events such as the discontinuation of a business  the closure or sale of an industrial site  disposals of non-operating buildings  impairment losses recorded for property  plant and equipment or intangible assets  as well as other material and unusual losses; Income on loans  cash investments and marketable securities; Finance costs; Other financial income and expense  which include the impact of discounting the pension benefit obligation and the return on related plan assets  the ineffective portion of interest rate and currency hedges  changes in value of interest rate and currency instruments for which the hedging relationship does not satisfy the criteria set forth in relationship cannot be demonstrated under IFRS 9  and gains and losses on sales of shares in subsidiaries; Taxes.Adjusted EBITDAAdjusted EBITDA is Operating income as defined above + depreciation and amortization of assets; to be fully compliant with the ESMA (European Securities and Markets Authority) regulation  this term of “Adjusted EBITDA” will be used by the Group as of January 1  2022 instead of the term “EBITDA” that was previously used (this means that “EBITDA” aggregates until 2021 are comparable with ‘Adjusted EBITDA” aggregates as from 2022).Net cash-flowNet cash-flow is defined as follow: Net cash from (used in) operating and investing activities less (acquisitions)/disposal of equity interests and businesses (net of cash and cash equivalents)  other changes and proceeds from disposal of financial assets. Repayment of IFRS 16 debt is not included.Net financial debtNet financial debt is defined as follow: Gross financial debt less cash and cash equivalents and derivatives classified under non-current and current assets. It includes the lease liabilities (IFRS 16 debt).Attachment",neutral,0.02,0.78,0.2,mixed,0.64,0.29,0.07,True,English,"['FULL YEAR RESULTS', 'typo page', 'group level', 'Correction', 'paragraph', 'February', '08', 'S&P Global Mobility', 'first €1bn disposal program', 'second €1bn disposal program', 'first one-billion-euro disposal program', 'Net debt/Adjusted EBITDA ratio', 'growing worldwide automotive production', 'Cumulated net cost synergies', '1 BILLION NET DEBT REDUCTION', 'Strong net cash flow', 'Net debt/Adj.

The Company listed the ADSs on The Nasdaq Global Select Market in November 2017 under the ticker ERYP  and subsequently transferred the listing of its ADSs to The Nasdaq Capital Market in April 2023. The ADSs trade in U.S. dollars.“Given PHAXIAM’s current stage of development  we have determined that delisting from the Nasdaq market was the wisest business and financial decision for the company. Being listed on the Nasdaq market requires significant financial and human resources to maintain proper compliance and reporting standards  which is not appropriate anymore for a company of our size. The delisting will save valuable resources and allow us to focus our optimized organization on key development programs  while maintaining our primary market presence on Euronext Paris”  said Eric Soyer  Chief Financial Officer of PHAXIAM Therapeutics.PHAXIAM Therapeutics remains listed on Euronext Paris as its primary trading market and intends to continue its disclosures in compliance with applicable French financial market regulations.
