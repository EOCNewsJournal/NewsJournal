He noted that Western states themselves still have assets in Russia that could be jeopardized if the frozen funds are tapped.“This is not a question for us  we are following the decisions of Western countries ” Siluanov stated. “We have frozen no less [of Western funds]. Any actions with our assets will receive a symmetrical response.”Western countries have blocked an estimated $300 billion in assets belonging to the Russian central bank since the start of the Ukraine conflict in February 2022.The UK and US have recently demanded an outright seizure of those funds in order to aid the government in Kiev  whereas the EU has been more cautious  opting instead for a plan to seize the interest earned from the assets held at the clearinghouse Euroclear. Many European countries have warned that an outright confiscation of the funds would reflect badly on the Western financial system and erode trust in the euro.While Siluanov did not elaborate on the amount of Western assets currently held in Russia  calculations by RIA Novosti put them at roughly equal the size of the Russian funds frozen abroad. Total foreign direct investments in the Russian economy by the EU  G7  Australia  and Switzerland amounted to $288 billion at the end of 2022  the news agency said in a report last month.Moscow has repeatedly challenged the legitimacy of the asset freezes  slamming the practice as “thievery” and warning of countermeasures should the West move to confiscate the funds. Siluanov warned that global players are closely following the story involving the Russian assets and are drawing their own conclusions.“The Chinese are reducing their exposure to American securities – this is a consequence of what is happening [with Russian assets].

Yellen acknowledged there were risks involved  but downplayed concerns raised by some in Europe that confiscating Russian assets would undermine the role of the U.S. dollar  euro or Japanese yen as important global reserve currencies.""I believe the G7 should work together to explore the number of approaches that have been suggested for unlocking their economic values. One would be  of course  seizing the assets themselves  but there are other ideas  such as using them as collateral to borrow from global markets "" Yellen said.She said she considered it ""extremely unlikely"" that any G7 move on Russian assets would result in a massive shift from currencies  given the uniqueness of this situation and what she called Russia's brazen violation of international norms.The countries involved represented half the global economy  and any action would be taken in coordination  she said.""It's important for the G7 to work together. We need to find a way that is legal  both domestically in all of our countries and also in accordance with international law "" she said.""We don't have a preferred strategy for how to do this. We want the G7 and our allies to act together "" she said.Yellen said there was a countermeasures theory that she felt had strong justification in international law  and if that was the justification chosen  all the measures would have to be designed to comply with that requirement.Yellen said there was a ""strong international law  economic and moral case"" for deriving value from the Russian assets  and doing so would also incentivize Moscow to negotiate a just peace with Ukraine  which faces an estimated cost of some $486 billion to rebuild and recover.The EU and G7 have been debating if and how these funds can be used for over a year. Two-thirds of these funds are in the EU with the majority of that held by Belgium's clearing house Euroclear. No agreement was expected at the meeting in Brazil.Yellen's comments echo a call by British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak last week for ""bolder"" action on the Russian assets  given Ukraine's need for more long-range weapons  drones and munitions  as well as other assistance.Yellen said the United States and its Group of Seven allies  which imposed sanctions on hundreds of Russian targets on Friday  would continue to act to restrict Russia's access to materials and money needed to wage its war against Ukraine.""(Russian President Vladimir) Putin's strategy is hoping he can simply wait out Ukraine and its allies. We must prove him wrong and show the Kremlin that we will collectively stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes "" Yellen said.She said she fully endorsed a first step taken by the European Union to harness windfall proceeds from Russian sovereign assets  but pushed for further action.The issue has taken on fresh importance since U.S. President Joe Biden remains at loggerheads with the leader of the Republican-led U.S. House of Representatives over efforts to approve some $61 billion in further aid to Ukraine.Yellen again called on the House to act.(You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel",neutral,0.09,0.75,0.16,negative,0.05,0.31,0.64,True,English,"['frozen Russian assets', 'Janet Yellen', 'Moves', 'value', 'U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen', 'British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak', 'U.S. President Joe Biden', 'Economic Times WhatsApp channel', 'Republican-led U.S. House', 'important global reserve currencies', 'U.S. dollar', 'Russian President Vladimir', 'clearing house Euroclear', 'Russian sovereign assets', 'global markets', 'global economy', 'Russian assets', 'economic values', 'Russian targets', 'news conference', 'G20 counterparts', 'different options', 'Japanese yen', 'other ideas', 'massive shift', 'international norms', 'international law', 'countermeasures theory', 'moral case', 'long-range weapons', 'other assistance', 'United States', 'first step', 'European Union', 'windfall proceeds', 'fresh importance', 'preferred strategy', 'associated risks', 'strong justification', 'The EU', 'Western allies', 'Seven allies', 'bolder"" action', 'G7 leaders', 'G7 move', 'Tuesday', 'urgency', 'Ukraine', 'meetings', 'solutions', 'June', 'concerns', 'role', 'number', 'approaches', 'collateral', 'uniqueness', 'situation', 'violation', 'countries', 'coordination', 'way', 'accordance', 'requirement', 'Moscow', 'peace', 'cost', 'funds', 'year', 'Two-thirds', 'majority', 'Belgium', 'agreement', 'Brazil', 'comments', 'call', 'need', 'drones', 'munitions', 'Group', 'sanctions', 'hundreds', 'Friday', 'access', 'materials', 'money', 'war', 'Putin', 'Kremlin', 'issue', 'loggerheads', 'Representatives', 'efforts', 'aid']",2024-02-27,2024-02-27,m.economictimes.com

Opponents say the EU has the most to lose by transferring the frozen assets – with nearly two-thirds of the funds immobilised within the body of nations.Mr Moiseienko said the “EU is more ambivalent  when compared to the UK’s position.”“The EU have two considerations. The first is the question of what happens to the bulk of the frozen assets. Euroclear have around $200bn (£158bn) belonging to Russia central bank. The current EU debate is what happens with that amount. They can invest for Euroclear’s own benefit and it can be taxed.“The second is what happens to the interest on the frozen cash and securities. The bulk are with Euroclear  generating interest of around €4-6bn (£3bn-£4.7bn). That amount has never belonged to Russian central bulk – unlike the rest of the assets – so it may be easier to transfer this to Ukraine  at least to begin with.”A letter signed by 10 international law experts and practitioners from Belgium  France  Germany  Japan  the Netherlands  the UK  and the US was sent to G7 leaders in early December.It outlined a number of legal justification for freezing assets  claiming the measures would not violate international law.“We have concluded that it would be lawful  under international law  for States which have frozen Russian State assets to take additional countermeasures against Russia  given its ongoing breach of the most fundamental rules of international law  in the form of transfers of Russian State assets as compensation for the damage that has resulted directly from Russia’s unlawful conduct ” the experts wrote.The logic of this legal standpoint rests on Russia’s initial violation of its international obligations in committing war crimes against Ukraine.The legal experts maintain that the countermeasures against Russia are permitted if they are taken against an offending state and are intended to persuade it to cease its unlawful conduct.The UK and the US have been pushing the EU to seize the Russia’s frozen assets outright  but France and Germany are currently opposed to the move over legal concerns  while the European Central Bank are both concerned about the right to seize the assets.What makes matters more complicated is that Russia could inevitably challenge the seizure of its assets in court  which could delay any frozen funds from benefiting Ukraine. Mr Moiseienko said: “There is a risk that there could be a further aggressive reaction from Russia where they confiscate European property in Russia – but there is little clarity about what how much of this there actually is.”Other opponents argue that transferring of Russian assets could deter future investment in Europe  however Mr Moiseienko says that because the Euro remained stable when the assets were initially seized by Europe  it is unlikely that this would happen in the event of the EU transferring the frozen assets to Ukraine.What happens next?Cameron is expected to represent the UK at a meeting hosted by French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris on Monday.At the top of the agenda will be Ukraine and the frozen assets  but real progress could be stalled until the all the G7 leaders meet in June.,neutral,0.14,0.74,0.12,negative,0.03,0.26,0.71,True,English,"['frozen assets', 'UK', 'Russian', 'frozen Russian central bank assets', 'Russian central bank reserves', 'European Central Bank', 'short-term economic interests', 'Australian National University', 'Russia central bank', 'Dr Anton Moiseienko', 'international financial centre', 'possible legal avenues', 'Russian central bulk', 'international law expert', 'The Sunday Times', 'Russian State assets', 'Russian war economy', 'broader national interest', 'current EU debate', 'frozen Russian assets', 'Russian sanctions', 'offending state', 'Mr Moiseienko', 'frozen cash', 'frozen assets', 'international obligations', 'legal implications', 'legal justification', 'legal standpoint', 'legal experts', 'legal concerns', 'Rishi Sunak', 'Vladimir Putin', 'Western leaders', 'continued support', 'Ukrainian president', 'Volodymyr Zelensky', 'two-year anniversary', 'continued backing', 'military support', 'long-range weapons', 'Mr Sunak', 'continued seizure', 'marginal gains', 'third year', 'Foreign Office', 'banking sector', 'David Cameron', 'Foreign Secretary', 'full-scale invasion', 'two considerations', 'G7 leaders', 'early December', 'ongoing breach', 'fundamental rules', 'unlawful conduct', 'initial violation', 'Western nations', 'The Government', 'Russia-Ukraine war', 'war crimes', 'additional countermeasures', 'UK government', 'UK politicians', 'war-hit Ukraine', 'UK banks', 'proceeds', 'defence', 'region', 'Kyiv', 'weekend', 'article', 'drones', 'munitions', 'hundreds', 'billions', 'questions', 'London', 'reputation', 'corners', 'transfer', 'stage', 'gridlock', 'sides', 'end-game', 'sight', 'conflict', 'warfare', 'money', '300bn', 'funds', 'limits', 'legality', 'representatives', 'financiers', 'City', 'reconstruction', 'bankers', 'institution', 'stakeholders', 'consequences', 'position', 'Moscow', 'Photo', 'Reuters', 'plans', 'scepticism', 'Opponents', 'two-thirds', 'body', 'Euroclear', 'amount', 'benefit', 'securities', 'letter', 'practitioners', 'Belgium', 'France', 'Germany', 'Japan', 'Netherlands', 'number', 'freezing', 'States', 'form', 'compensation', 'damage', 'logic', 'move', 'right', '£']",2024-02-27,2024-02-27,inews.co.uk

Reflecting its significant and measurable environmental actions  JCDecaux has improved its general evaluation from A- to A and is part of CDP A List as in 2019 and 2021  showcasing companies that are leading the way in the fight against climate change. This year  JCDecaux is amongst 17% of companies that reached Leadership level in the Web & Marketing Services category  with a performance well above the category average (C).This latest recognition of the Group's efforts to cut emissions  mitigate climate risks and develop a low-carbon economy is real proof of its commitment  the strength of its policy and its transparency on environmental issues.A detailed and independent methodology is used by CDP to assess companies  allocating a score of A to D- based on the comprehensiveness of disclosure  awareness and management of environmental risks and demonstration of best practices associated with environmental leadership  such as setting ambitious and meaningful targets. Those that don’t disclose or provide insufficient information are scored an F.In 2019  JCDecaux was the first outdoor advertising group to join RE100  an international initiative bringing together businesses committed to 100% renewable electricity. Today  the Group is actively pursuing plans to reduce its carbon impact through practical initiatives such as:Conducting life cycle analyses on its urban furniture in order to identify the main environmental impacts  applying eco-design principles and refurbishing equipment at the end of the contract  complying with the principles of the circular economy;Reducing the electricity consumption of its street furniture  by replacing old lighting systems with newer and more environmentally-friendly technologies such as LEDs  which are more energy-efficient (LED retrofit)  solutions to reduce the light intensity (dimming) or even temporarily switch off the power supply at certain times  as well as rationalised management of the size of small digital displays;Covering 100% of its power requirements with electricity from renewable sources since 2022;Selecting low emissions vehicles wherever possible for operating staff.The Group is confident in its response to the environmental challenges of the future. Its strong commitment to mitigating the effects of climate change is set out in its new strategic ESG roadmap for 2030  unveiled in 2022  and its Climate Strategy  unveiled in 2023.Reducing the Group's carbon footprint remains an absolute priority and JCDecaux is committed to achieving Net Zero Carbon by 2050. To achieve this  the Group has committed to a Science-Based Targets (SBTi) trajectory with short- and long-term absolute emission reduction targets at company level  based on the following objectives:By 2030: reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions by at least 60% and Scope 3 emissions by 46% in absolute value vs. 2019 (market-based).By 2050: reduce by at least 90% the emissions of scopes 1  2 and 3 in absolute value vs. 2019 (market-based).At the end of 2023  JCDecaux submitted its reduction trajectory to SBTi for review and validation.Sherry Madera  CEO of CDP  said: “Congratulations to all the companies on CDP’s A List  and those companies that started or accelerated their journey towards environmental transparency in 2023 – we saw a 24% increase of disclosures last year and that trajectory is to be applauded. It is only by laying the groundwork of disclosure that companies can show they are serious about the vital part they play in securing a net-zero  nature-positive future. Earning a place on the A List is about more than the score. It’s an indication of high quality  complete data that equips companies with a holistic view of their environmental impact  serves as a baseline for transition plans and – crucially – enables them to follow through on their ambitions. As we move deeper into the Decade of Action  and as CDP continually raises the bar for what represents environmental leadership  the work of A List companies is never complete. We look forward to seeing all companies turn their commitments into further and more meaningful and effective action.”Jean-François Decaux  Chairman of the Executive Board and Co-CEO of JCDecaux  said: “We are particularly proud to be on the CDP A list again. This recognition reflects our historical commitment to a sustainable business model that respects society and the environment  while demonstrating to all our stakeholders our maturity and sense of responsibility towards the climate emergency. As a major player involved in sustainable development and anticipating the future changes  we call for a public procurement  combining standards of quality  sustainability and efficiency.”About CDPCDP is a global non-profit that runs the world’s environmental disclosure system for companies  cities  states and regions.

He will be participating in the panel  “Policy Watch: Corporate Transparency Act ” on February 27  2024.The panel will feature experts discussing the new beneficial ownership rule that went into effect at the beginning of this year. As part of the U.S. Corporate Transparency Act (CTA)  the rule will impact approximately 32.6 million reporting companies in 2024  with an additional five million new reporting companies moving forward. As there are significant consequences for non-compliance  awareness as to whether a business entity is subject to the new rules will be critical.“While there has been progress towards fostering increased awareness of the new beneficial ownership rule  we still have a way to go to help ensure that business entities subject to the new rule are aware of these CTA reporting obligations ” said Rupak Venugopal  Vice President  Beneficial Ownership  Wolters Kluwer Financial & Corporate Compliance. “David Spencer will be sharing valuable information about the initial and ongoing reporting requirements to help business entities and their advisors determine eligibility—and key considerations when determining how to best navigate those requirements in a compliant manner.”A recent Wolters Kluwer survey of more than 5 100 attendees who participated in the latest of a series of educational webinars since the new regulation took effect showed that 43% of respondents viewed their organizations as “between 25% to 50%” prepared to comply. Virtually one-third of respondents (31%) indicated they were “not at all prepared” to comply with the initial and ongoing compliance requirements.Presented by the Structured Finance Association (SFA)  the conference features industry leaders representing the full spectrum of market participants including investors  issuers  financial intermediaries  regulators  law firms  accounting firms  technology firms  rating agencies  servicers  and trustees.Wolters Kluwer continues to share insights around the new beneficial ownership rule to promote the sharing of best practices among all industry participants. The company provides a range of helpful resources—such as an easy-to-use self-guided eligibility quiz—along with educational webinars and web-based content—to help ensure that impacted entities and the advisors they rely on can effectively prepare for and navigate the new requirements.

The reconsideration process will re-examine  with new assessors  the decision based on information that was included in the original submission. During this process  the applicant may be given an opportunity to be heard for the first time by a panel of experts. The reconsideration process could take up to 6 months.The key major clinical concerns considered unresolved at the end of the procedure and the rationale for reconsideration are as follows:1) Multiple amendments have been made that create uncertainty of the reliability of the study dataA request for reconsideration could be filed on the basis of the following points:The Agency recognized that:Changing the status of a study from phase 2 to phase 3 may not be uncommon  especially in rare or terminal diseases.Multiple amendments may be an inevitable situation in some studies  including for strategic reasons  and that the number of amendments (3) made for study AB10015 are in line with the average number of amendments (3.3 per protocol) highlighted in a recent Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development report [1].Amendments of study AB10015 were not data-driven.Study AB10015 had broad inclusion criteria with a heterogenous population  and the Agency did not dispute the need to limit heterogeneity.Post-onset decline of 1.1 point per month may be a relevant prognostic factor and therefore the distinction between Normal and Fast progressors may be less arbitrary than initially considered.However  the Agency considered that amendments have been made late and were not sufficiently justified. Counterarguments to this could include:The distinction between Normal and Fast progressors was made in an entirely blinded and sufficiently prospective manner  in terms of timing (2.5 years prior to unblinding) and in terms of data accrual (12% of the enrolled patients who could have reached the study’s primary analysis timepoint  meaning 88% of the data remained to be acquired and only 8 Fast progressor patients  across 3 treatment arms  could have reached the study’s primary analysis timepoint).Excluding Fast progressor patients from the primary analysis was adequately justified for the reasons of limiting missing data  as recommended by relevant guidelines. An expectation of there being a high discontinuation rate for Fast progressor patients at the study’s primary analysis timepoint of 48 weeks was confirmed with a discontinuation rate of over 50% versus 25% for Normal progressor patients. This amendment was also adequately implemented  being a decision from the study’s principal coordinator and steering committee that was validated by all agencies  including Health Canada  in a context of a pivotal study.2) Missing data have been treated in the planned primary and sensitivity analyses with LOCF (last observation carried forward) imputation method  potentially creating a bias in favor of treatmentA request for reconsideration could be filed on the basis of the following points:The Agency recognized that the concern about the non-linearity of the distribution of the ALSFRS-R data set used for the test of the primary analysis (ANCOVA test) was resolved by the positive pre-specified rerandomization test  which does not make assumptions about the normality of the data distribution.However  the Agency considered that the LOCF method used for imputation of missing data could potentially bias results in favor of masitinib. Counterarguments to this could include:Various sensitivity analyses  not based on LOCF method and requested by agencies  were performed using different recognized methodologies for imputing missing data  including multiple imputation (p=0.020)  the most conservative jump-to reference (JTR) analysis (p=0.039)  and copy of increment (CIR) analysis (p=0.0477)  all pointing toward the superiority of masitinib.The predefined Progression Free Survival (PFS) endpoint  which is not affected by LOCF methodology  was significantly increased by 4 months.The non-parametric Combined Assessment of Function and Survival (CAFS) endpoint  incorrectly assumed by the Agency to be based on LOCF methodology  whereas it is not  approached the conventionally statistically significant outcome of 5% (p=0.0776)  even though the study was not powered for this secondary endpoint.AB Science provided a methodologically justified new claim “patients with ALS prior to any loss of function”  where CAFS and Overall Survival (OS) are significantly improved.3) New proposed claim  a subgroup called “patients with ALS prior to loss of function” which shows a significant gain in OS and CAFS is considered post hocA request for reconsideration could be filed on the basis of the following points:AB Science proposed a reduced claim “patients with ALS prior to any loss of function”  this reduced claim being justified by the strict application of EMA guidance (EMA/CHMP/539146/2013) on the investigation of subgroups in confirmatory clinical trials.While the Agency recognized that this claim may be logical and in line with ALS guidelines recommending selecting ALS patients as early as possible  they also considered that this EMA guidance was only applicable for pre-specified subgroups. A counterargument to this opinion  in favor of it being applicable to AB10015  is that this EMA guidance states that “it might be of interest to identify a subgroup that has not been pre-specified as part of the confirmatory testing strategy  where efficacy and risk-benefit would be convincing”.In this claim  the treatment effect is exceptionally strong  with a significant CAFS (p= 0.0290) and significant long-term median OS benefit of +10 months (p=0.0395)  and +22 months (p=0.0192) when placebo-treated patients who switched to masitinib during the extension period are censored at the time of the switch.The Agency also considered that OS could have been biased by confounding factors. A counterargument to this could be that OS is the gold standard endpoint in ALS and is unbiased regardless of post study treatments because no drug has demonstrated OS benefit (except riluzole which was available to all patients) and because all patients had the same possibility to benefit from tracheostomy or permanent or non-permanent ventilation.Based on the supporting arguments and counterarguments outlined above  AB Science intends to submit a Request for Reconsideration. Other points of concern identified by the agency will also be responded to.Reference[1] Getz K.   Smith Z.   Botto E.   Murphy E.   & Dauchy A..

In line with its ""Ambition 2025"" plan to become the European leader in data marketing  DÉKUPLE continues to grow  and its business mix confirms its resilience in a tense socio-economic climate.Our Digital Marketing activities have been the main drivers of this performance. Now accounting for 60% of consolidated sales  compared with 36.5% three years ago  these activities have maintained the intensity of their development  with gross margin growth of +39% compared with 2022. This growth is driven by the continued expansion of our consulting activities  and by the strong development of our engineering and marketing engagement activities. During the year  we expanded our footprint through strategic acquisitions and introduced new offerings. Our advances in Artificial Intelligence were also significant  opening up new avenues for efficiency and creativity in operations to serve our customers and partners.This positive trend in our BtoB business more than offset the downturn in our BtoC business which  despite an unfavorable consumer environment  continued to invest heavily in sales and marketing to support its recurring revenue-generating portfolios. In a sharply shrinking press market  the Magazines business slightly improved its recruitment of new subscribers in the second half  enabling us to limit the full-year sales decline to -7.8%. At the same time  the Insurance business reported a solid performance  with sales virtually stable in the face of a high basis for comparison in 2022.Over the past three years  our Group has established itself as a privileged partner in the digital and marketing transformation of our customers  by placing data and technology at the heart of our innovative business model. Our multi-entrepreneurial  empowered organization  focused on growth and performance  as well as the talent of our 1 000 engineers  consultants and marketing experts  position us favorably to continue DÉKUPLE's development.Backed by solid financial resources  we are keeping a close eye on external growth opportunities in France and Europe  in complementary  high-potential fields. We will also continue to invest in Generative AI to support our services.Confident in our model  we are determined to achieve another year of growth in 2024.""KEY FIGURES FOR BUSINESS 2023In 2023  the DÉKUPLE Group posted consolidated sales of €199.7 million  up 10.2% on 2022.

Broadpeak’s BkS450 high-performance video streaming software is enhanced with Quality on Demand (QoD) Network APIs capabilities to improve the stability of video streaming for mobile users. Azure Programmable Connectivity (APC) solution and Deutsche Telekom’s Network API support are used to process and enforce the QoD requests. The three parties successfully tested the solution on the Telekom Edge Cloud platform in Berlin  Germany.“The bandwidth available to 4G and 5G mobile users can sometimes shrink momentarily  at busy hours or during popular streaming events ” said Guillaume Bichot  head of exploration at Broadpeak. “We are proud to address this issue with our successful proof-of-concept demonstration of the industry’s first video streaming software enhanced with QoD Network APIs. Our award-winning BkS450 will help communication service providers  pay-TV operators  and video content providers maintain the highest quality for mainstream streaming services in challenging network conditions.”Broadpeak’s BkS450 streaming software  enhanced with QoD Network APIs  boosts the network bandwidth made available to specific users when the video streaming experience starts to deteriorate. Once network conditions go back to normal  the bandwidth boost is released. In the end-to-end workflow  APC is the first destination point of Broadpeak’s streaming software API call. APC triggers Deutsche Telekom’s QoD Network API  whose mobile network then enforces the requested QoD boost for the users that need it.The outcome is a much more stable streaming service for mobile and fixed wireless customers  with the highest quality  even when network conditions are challenging.“One of the most common ways to watch video content today is streaming on mobile devices  but the quality of experience has to be high and reliable even when the network is busy to keep users satisfied ” said Ross Ortega  Vice President  Product Management  Microsoft Azure for Operators. “Using Microsoft Azure Programmable Connectivity with innovations from Broadpeak and Deutsche Telekom  communication service providers can unlock an outstanding and predictable quality of experience for video streaming on any screen.”With its new solution  Broadpeak will dramatically increase the value of operators’ networks for video distribution  augmenting the capabilities of their network and driving monetization.“We’re excited to join Broadpeak and Microsoft Azure in bringing superior-quality streaming to the mobile world with our network APIs ” said Noel Wirzius  Product Manager for Network APIs at Deutsche Telekom Global Carrier. “Testing in our lab showed tremendous outcomes for streaming quality of experience. When artificially pushing the cell load to its limits  users benefiting from the QoD Network API saw smooth streaming sessions with high resolution  while everyone else experienced video freezes and poor image quality.”Broadpeak will demonstrate the tested proof-of-concept version at Mobile World Congress 2024  on the company’s stand – CS299  at the Deutsche Telekom stand – 3M31  and on the Microsoft stand – 3H30.

Exports accounted for 83% of revenue  down from 92% in the previous year  with a significant increase in Western Europe (excluding France)  particularly Germany.Strong momentum in the ORC businessThe ORC business generated revenue of €4.4 million in 2023  up from €3.1 million in 2022. It was driven mainly by the contract in Germany for a total of 40 machines  which will be completed in the first quarter of 2024. The Company’s revenue also benefited from several large orders  notably in the geothermal and marine sectors.ENOGIA has started work on its first order for ORC modules in the marine sector  with Chantiers de l’Atlantique. Designed to equip two cruise ships  the ENOGIA units are the new ENO‑180LT‑M module  a marine version of the standard ENO‑180LT module capable of producing 180 kW of electricity from a low-temperature heat source (from 90°C). This collaboration reflects the shared environmental ambitions of ENOGIA and the Chantiers de l’Atlantique group.The Company also signed a major sale of ENO-180LT modules in another strategic market  geothermal energy  to the Taiwan Cement Corporation (TCC) through its local partner E-Formula. The contract is to equip a power plant producing electricity from a geothermal well located in the country’s south-east. The Taiwanese group’s choice of ENOGIA ORC modules  which will be integrated into converted containers  was determined by several differentiating factors: the modularity of the machines  their performance and their flexibility  which will allow the micro-turbines to adapt if the operating conditions of the well differ from those expected.Successful repositioning of the turbomachinery development businessENOGIA’s second business  dedicated to the development of compressors for Hydrogen Fuel Cells  was repositioned in early 2023 to focus on development for third parties  and renamed “Innovative Turbomachinery”. It posted revenue of €0.63 million in 2023  a near fourfold increase (+275%). This development reflects the strong growth in services for the design and manufacture of custom turbomachinery for industry. The Company has made progress on several contracts with manufacturers committed to decarbonisation  including a project with STX Engine (a subsidiary of South Korean conglomerate STX) in May  as part of a CO2 capture project in maritime transport.Sustained commercial activity in early 2024With an order book of €6.7 million as of 31 December 2023[1] (vs > €5 million in 2022)  the Company aims to maintain its robust commercial momentum in 2024.Commercial activity has been very buoyant and encouraging at the start of the year. In an environment rich in opportunities  ENOGIA’s unique ORC micro-turbomachinery technology  which addresses most of the market (recovery and conversion of waste heat starting at low power and low temperatures)  is arousing strong interest in several sectors. The trend is particularly positive in geothermal energy and industry  but also in the maritime sector  which is faced with high fuel costs and an increasingly demanding regulatory environment.The Green Shield Power Solutions business model  which  through partnerships with ADEME Investissements and Eiffel Gaz Vert  offers the sale of a service for producing electricity from waste heat rather than the direct sale of equipment  is set to gain momentum in the industrial and geothermal sectors in 2024  in France and internationally.At the same time  the ramp-up in turbomachinery development services is expected to continue.Against this backdrop  ENOGIA confirms its expectation of revenue growth averaging more than 50% per year in both 2024 and 2025.Next release:2023 annual results  27 March 2024 after tradingAboutEnogia ENOGIA responds to the major challenges of the ecological and energy transition with its unique and patented technology of compact  light and durable micro-turbomachinery. As the French leader in heat-to-electricity conversion with its wide range of ORC modules  ENOGIA enables its customers to produce decarbonised electricity and to recover waste or renewable heat. With sales in more than 25 countries  ENOGIA continues to prospect for new customers in France and internationally. Founded in 2009 and based in Marseille  the company has a strong commitment to CSR (rated “Advanced” by EthiFinance). It employs around 50 people involved in the design  production and marketing of environmentally friendly technological solutions. ENOGIA is listed on Euronext Growth Paris. Ticker: ALENO.

The plan represents a first for both companies  deepening their partnership  and facilitating the sharing of data that will inform progress towards their net zero goals. They agree to create an emissions baseline regarding the GHG emissions of Orange Business solutions that integrate Cisco products  allowing both organisations to measure GHG emissions across their shared portfolio.Both companies have ambitious net zero goals and other near-term targets related to reducing emissions and evolving their businesses to a circular model. Orange has set a goal to reduce its GHG emissions by 45% across all scopes by 2030*  committing to reaching net zero by 2040. Cisco has set a goal to reach net-zero GHG emissions across its value chain by 2040 and has also set a goal to reduce absolute Scope 3 emissions from purchased goods and services  upstream transportation and distribution  and use of sold Cisco products by 30% by 2030**.This MoU arose in recognition of the interdependencies in achieving both companies' GHG emission reduction goals  and the understanding that a new kind of collaborative partnership is required to help accelerate progress. Both organisations hope that this MoU will represent the first of many collaborations towards joint net zero models.""Sustainability is woven into everything we do at Cisco  from our product development  to our operations  to our partnerships "" said Chuck Robbins  Chair and CEO  Cisco. ""We have an aggressive timeline to reach net zero and our partnership with Orange Business is a major step in that direction. By sharing data and best practices  we are going to hold ourselves accountable to our shared goals and mission  and hopefully inspire others to join us in this journey.""""Orange Group is committed to being Net Zero by 2040. At Orange Business we support both our enterprise customers and partners in their transformation to lead a more responsible economy and society "" explained Aliette Mousnier Lompre  CEO Orange Business. ""We encourage all stakeholders to embed environmental issues as a key priority into their day-to-day processes and activities. Together with Cisco  we can drive and satisfy these ambitions to build and empower a more sustainable future for all.""The MoU includes a number of key focus areas that Cisco and Orange Business will work together on  including:1. GHG Emissions TrajectoryCisco and Orange Business aim to build a GHG emissions trajectory for the Cisco products used by Orange Business. Both partners will use shared data to help estimate the GHG emissions related to Orange Business solutions integrating Cisco technology with the objective to reduce GHG emissions.2. Carbon Impact of Products and ServicesCisco aims to provide Orange Business with data on the estimated carbon footprint of Cisco products sold by Orange Business. This will allow Orange Business to integrate this data into their own emissions calculations in order to estimate the overall carbon footprint of Orange's solutions portfolio integrating Cisco products. Orange Business will then be able to provide their customers with an estimate of the total emissions of their supplied products and solutions.3. Emphasis on Circular Economy Programs and PrinciplesCisco and Orange Business agree to focus on increasing the uptake of circular economy principles and practices by Orange Business and its customers. This will be done through two channels  first boosting the purchase of remanufactured units through the Cisco Refresh Program  then through the uptake of Cisco´s Takeback and Reuse Program facilitated by Orange Business.4. Eco-designed Products and Solutions of the FutureOrange Business and Cisco will also endeavor to explore different ways to integrate eco-design principles into the design of products and services. For this purpose  Cisco will provide Orange Business with Lifecycle Analysis data for its products  when available. This will help Orange Business to reach its goal of a 100% rate of eco-designed solutions offered to its customers.Cisco and Orange Business have previously worked together on several joint sustainability initiatives***  including a smart office solution that better manages conference rooms  enhances user experience and proactively optimizes energy consumption. They also collaborated on an energy saving initiative at the Orange Velodrome in Marseille  France  developing a solution that converted always-on Wi-Fi networks to on-demand systems. Last  Orange Business is using the Flexible SD-WAN ""One Box"" based on Cisco technology  merging several routing features into one single unit  decreasing the environmental impact  and reducing the energy consumption by more than 70%.Notes to the editor* Compared to Orange Business GHG emissions from baseline year 2020.** By Cisco fiscal year 2030 and compared to Cisco GHG emissions from Cisco's baseline fiscal year 2019.*** Demos of these solutions will be available at the Orange Business booth at Mobile World Congress 2024.About CiscoCisco (NASDAQ: CSCO) is the worldwide technology leader that securely connects everything to make anything possible.

The plan represents a first for both companies  deepening their partnership  and facilitating the sharing of data that will inform progress towards their net zero goals. They agree to create an emissions baseline regarding the GHG emissions of Orange Business solutions that integrate Cisco products  allowing both organisations to measure GHG emissions across their shared portfolio.Both companies have ambitious net zero goals and other near-term targets related to reducing emissions and evolving their businesses to a circular model. Orange has set a goal to reduce its GHG emissions by 45% across all scopes by 2030*  committing to reaching net zero by 2040. Cisco has set a goal to reach net-zero GHG emissions across its value chain by 2040 and has also set a goal to reduce absolute Scope 3 emissions from purchased goods and services  upstream transportation and distribution  and use of sold Cisco products by 30% by 2030**.This MoU arose in recognition of the interdependencies in achieving both companies’ GHG emission reduction goals  and the understanding that a new kind of collaborative partnership is required to help accelerate progress. Both organisations hope that this MoU will represent the first of many collaborations towards joint net zero models.“Enhancing sustainability and reducing the environmental footprint for ourselves  our partners  and customers has been a longstanding priority at Cisco. We understand that sustainability is a collaborative effort and success demands partnership. Together with Orange Business  we can deliver data-backed advances to help protect our planet for future generations ” Chuck Robbins  CEO Cisco.“The Orange Group is committed to being Net Zero by 2040. In addition  our enterprise customers are increasingly factoring in decarbonization into their choice of vendors. Together with Cisco  Orange Business can drive and satisfy these ambitions to build and empower a more sustainable future for all ” explains Aliette Mousnier Lompre  CEO Orange Business.The MoU includes a number of key focus areas that Cisco and Orange Business will work together on  including:1. GHG Emissions TrajectoryCisco and Orange Business aim to build a GHG emissions trajectory for the Cisco products used by Orange Business. Both partners will use shared data to help estimate the GHG emissions related to Orange Business solutions integrating Cisco technology with the objective to reduce GHG emissions.2. Carbon Impact of Products and ServicesCisco aims to provide Orange Business with data on the estimated carbon footprint of Cisco products sold by Orange Business. This will allow Orange Business to integrate this data into their own emissions calculations in order to estimate the overall carbon footprint of Orange’s solutions portfolio integrating Cisco products. Orange Business will then be able to provide their customers with an estimate of the total emissions of their supplied products and solutions.3. Emphasis on Circular Economy Programs and PrinciplesCisco and Orange Business agree to focus on increasing the uptake of circular economy principles and practices by Orange Business and its customers. This will be done through two channels  first boosting the purchase of remanufactured units through the Cisco Refresh Program  then through the uptake of Cisco´s Takeback and Reuse Program facilitated by Orange Business.4. Eco-designed Products and Solutions of the FutureOrange Business and Cisco will also endeavor to explore different ways to integrate eco-design principles into the design of products and services. For this purpose  Cisco will provide Orange Business with Lifecycle Analysis data for its products  when available. This will help Orange Business to reach its goal of a 100% rate of eco-designed solutions offered to its customers.Cisco and Orange Business have previously worked together on several joint sustainability initiatives***  including a smart office solution that better manages conference rooms  enhances user experience and proactively optimizes energy consumption. They also collaborated on an energy saving initiative at the Orange Velodrome in Marseille  France  developing a solution that converted always-on Wi-Fi networks to on-demand systems. Last  Orange Business is using the Flexible SD-WAN “One Box” based on Cisco technology  merging several routing features into one single unit  decreasing the environmental impact  and reducing the energy consumption by more than 70%.Notes to the editor* Compared to Orange Business GHG emissions from baseline year 2020.** By Cisco fiscal year 2030 andcompared to Cisco GHG emissions from Cisco’s baseline fiscal year 2019.*** Demos of these solutions will be available at the Orange Business booth at Mobile World Congress 2024.About CiscoCisco (NASDAQ: CSCO) is the worldwide technology leader that securely connects everything to make anything possible.

For acquisition and management commissions linked to sales of insurance policies  net sales comprise current and future commissions issued  acquired by the accounting reporting date  net of cancellations.2 For the digital marketing business  the gross margin represents the total amount of net sales (total invoices issued: fees  commissions and purchases charged back to customers) less the total amount of costs for external purchases made on behalf of customers. It is equal to net sales for the magazine and insurance business lines.3 The scope effect is calculated (i) by eliminating the net sales of companies acquired during the period or the comparable period and (ii) by eliminating the net sales of companies sold during the period or the comparable period.

For acquisition and management commissions linked to sales of insurance policies  net sales comprise current and future commissions issued  acquired by the accounting reporting date  net of cancellations.2 For the digital marketing business  the gross margin represents the total amount of net sales (total invoices issued: fees  commissions and purchases charged back to customers) less the total amount of costs for external purchases made on behalf of customers. It is equal to net sales for the magazine and insurance business lines.3 The scope effect is calculated (i) by eliminating the net sales of companies acquired during the period or the comparable period and (ii) by eliminating the net sales of companies sold during the period or the comparable period. As a result  the like-for-like business does not take into account this scope effect for the period concerned.4 Gross sales volume represents the value of subscriptions and other products sold.

This quarter was marked by the good acceleration of production  enabling the group to achieve the annual target with +16% growth over the whole of 2023. Driven by the good momentum of the Group's markets  the commercial activity delivered a solid performance with €124 million in new orders in the 4th quarter  including a new contract for underwater mine countermeasures in the United Arab Emirates for €28 million.As a reminder  Exail Technologies presents its revenue divided into two complementary and vertically integrated business segments:The Navigation & Maritime Robotics segment comprises the group's two main vertically integrated activities: the sale of navigation systems  positioning systems  sonar; the marketing of drones and autonomous drone systems for maritime applications  integrating the group's navigation systems and other equipment in order to offer the most efficient robotic solutions.This segment accounts for around 75% of the group's revenue and 90% of its order book.The Advanced Technologies segment consists of developing and marketing the most efficient photonic and quantum components (special optical fibers  optical modulators  quantum measurement instruments) and products using the most advanced technologies (embedded communication equipment  simulators  decision-making autonomy). These components and products are sold directly to third parties or integrated into systems in the Maritime Navigation & Robotics segment.This segment represents around 25% of the group's revenue and 10% of its order book.Revenue by segment in 2023 and 2022 at equivalent scope(€ million)Q42023Q42022[1]Var.%FY2023FY2022at equivalent scope[2]Var.% Consolidated revenue 104 89 +18% 323 278 +16% Navigation & Maritime Robotics Segment 79 66 +21% 245 211 +16% Advanced Technologies Segment 26 24 +8% 85 71 +19% Structure & Intra-Group eliminations -1 -1 - -7 -4 - Backlog at the end of the period 630 628 - 630 628 -2023 and 2022 revenue published[3](€ million)FY2023FY2022publishedVar.% Consolidated revenue 323 180 +80%Order intake in the 4th quarter 2023: €124 million  up +20%Orders were strong this quarter  driven in particular by continued commercial success for navigation systems and a major new contract for a robotic underwater mine countermeasures system. For the full year 2023  orders amounted to €324 million  up +14%.Maritime Navigation and Robotics segment: €101 million in orders  up +50%Nearly €55 million in orders for navigation and positioning systemsIn the field of naval defense  Exail was again selected for strategic programs in the last quarter of 2023. They concern several of the world's major navies and each represent several million euros for the group. One of the notable successes of the quarter was the equipping of the Dutch Navy's future anti-submarine frigates with high-end inertial measurement units.Overall  in 2023  the group  already a leader in these applications  gained market share thanks to the quality of its solutions.Exail has also made inroads into several markets for civilian applications. Notable year-end contracts include:An order worth nearly €10 million in maritime transport from a world leader in the sector A new order in New Space with the Astrix-NS power plant. This signature confirms the good positioning of this new product  which began marketing in 2023.A major new contract for a robotic system in the Middle EastFollowing an international call for tenders for a defense application  Exail Technologies signed a €28 million contract at the very end of 2023 to supply a drone system to the United Arab Emirates Navy. The program is expected to begin in February and generate revenue in 2024. It will be spread over 3 years. More details on this program may be revealed at a later date with the client's agreement.This contract confirms Exail Technologies' leadership in the field of robotic systems for defense. It also strengthens the group's visibility in international markets and its ability to meet the complex and demanding needs of its customers. This success paves the way for new business opportunities for current and upcoming tenders  both in the Middle East and elsewhere in the world.In addition  Exail has secured more than €10 million worth of orders under existing contracts  for complementary services or operational maintenance.Advanced Technologies segment: a good level of commercial activityThe Advanced Technologies segment continued its good momentum  with €22 million in orders in the 4th quarter 2023. Half of these orders are generated by sales of state-of-the-art optical and quantum components to a very diverse customer base. The other half includes critical equipment for civil aeronautics (such as emergency beacons).Compared to the same quarter last year  the level of order intake was €13 million lower due to an exceptionally large contract for this segment (around €20 million)  which was signed in December 2022.Among the sectors driving the performance  applications in the space sector have grown strongly  as well as telecommunications and physical laser measurement applications. Notable orders for the quarter include:A complementary order of integrated optical systems for a world leader in high-precision topographic measurements. After a first order at the beginning of the year  this customer entrusted Exail with an order twice as large at the end of the year.A first order for quantum instruments for a new player in the sector  WeLinq  which has selected Exail as the supplier for its industrial-standard quantum memory project.Several orders for optical components for state-of-the-art research laboratories in applied physics  such as the Johns Hopkins laboratory  the largest in the USA.Revenue up +18% in the last quarter of 2023Exail Technologies recorded revenue of €104 million in the last quarter. This high level compared to previous quarters is linked to the seasonality of the last quarter (the most important of the year). Revenue growth was driven primarily by navigation systems.For the full year 2023  the group's revenue amounted to €323 million  an increase of +16% compared to 2022 at equivalent scope.Navigation & Maritime Robotics: €79 million  +21% growthGrowth in the quarter was mainly driven by sales of inertial measurement units and acoustic positioning systems. The group's teams managed to increase deliveries of these products by +43% this quarter. The Naval Defence sector was the largest  followed by applications for civil maritime operations.Underwater mine-hunting programs have also made a positive contribution  notably the BENL programme  which concerns the supply of underwater drone systems to the Belgian and Dutch navies. For the year 2023  the revenue generated on this program is around €55 million (+€10 million compared to 2022  in line with the backlog delivery plan). On the other hand  the contribution of new contracts for robotic systems was lower than expected due to the postponements over time.Advanced technologies: a weaker last quarter (+8%) in the midst of an excellent year (+19%)Revenues in this segment were at a satisfactory level in the last quarter. The growth  lower than that of the 1st segment  reflects the different seasonality in 2023 due to the business mix. Over the year 2023  revenues are up sharply by +19%. The activity realized by this segment for the Maritime Navigation & Robotics segment increased significantly in 2023 due to the uptake in the production of navigation systems  using fibers and optical modulators produced in-house.ProspectsExail Technologies should benefit from the good momentum of its markets  both in the defense sector and for civil applications  and from its high backlog. 2024 is expected to be a very active year in terms of tenders  with several major programs that could be decided. Exail Technologies will continue to invest significantly and mobilize its resources in commercial actions (responses to calls for tenders  spontaneous offers  demonstrations  etc.) with the objective of securing a very large backlog in the medium term. These efforts have been rewarded in 2023 in the Middle East.The execution of the programme for the Belgian and Dutch navies suggests that the activity should remain stable in 2024. The growth of the Maritime Navigation & Robotics division will therefore be driven by Navigation systems  which are expected to grow by more than 15%. The Advanced Technologies division is also expected to grow by more than 15%.For the full year 2024  Exail Technologies is targeting a double-digit increase in revenue.In the medium term  the group is particularly confident about the underlying trends driving its activities.The technological developments in its markets are pushing for the wider adoption of robotics  photonics  quantum  sonar and next-generation navigation technologies mastered by the group  at the expense of older technologies The geopolitical context  which initially benefited short-cycle defence investments  should now also benefit the major programmes targeted by Exail Technologies.hAbout Exail TechnologiesExail Technologies is the new name of the Gorgé Group  adopted after the transformation of the group at the end of 2022  now focused on the activities of its subsidiary Exail.

GTT  the technological expert in membrane containment systems used to transport and store liquefied gases  today announces its results for the 2023 financial year.Commenting on the results  Philippe Berterottière  Chairman and CEO of GTT  said: “With a total of 73 LNG carrier orders  two ethane carrier orders  and one FLNG unit order in the financial year 2023  the commercial performance of our core business remains buoyant. Demand for LNG remains particularly high and sustainable  as borne out by the number of final investment decisions for new liquefaction plants – involving substantial volumes – that were confirmed at the beginning of the financial year. Continued strong demand for LNG  coupled with the construction of new liquefaction plants  will continue to fuel further demand for LNG carriers. In addition  with the ageing of fleets and the introduction of new environmental regulations  the replacement market is expected to grow in the coming years.For LNG as fuel  GTT booked 15 orders in 2023  with commercial momentum benefitting from a return to normal LNG spot prices.In 2023  Ascenz Marorka was awarded several major contracts with leading ship-owners  highlighting the relevance of our digital solutions. Furthermore  we are also announcing today the acquisition of VPS  a Danish company specialising in ship performance management.Finally  Elogen  our subsidiary specialising in PEM electrolysers for green hydrogen production  posted a strong increase in revenues. With the January 2024 launch of construction of its gigafactory in Vendôme  Elogen also achieved a major milestone in its move towards mass production.The GTT Group continues to pursue its ongoing efforts in R&D and innovation  as evidenced by the numerous new approvals obtained from classification societies in 2023  notably in the fields of alternative fuels and liquid hydrogen transport.On the financial front  revenues rose significantly in the financial year 2023 – up 39% compared to 2022 – driven by the progressive increase in the number of LNG carriers under construction  Elogen’s growth  and the services business line. EBITDA increased by 46% in 2023 to stand at 235 million euros  due to sound cost management and the absence of significant delays in shipbuilding schedules.GTT benefits from very strong visibility on its core business over the coming years  with cumulated revenues for the period from 2024 to 2029 amounting to 1 815 million euros. Regarding our outlook for the current year  considering the distribution of order book over time  we estimate that consolidated revenues for 2024 should be within the range of 600 to 640 million euros  and consolidated EBITDA within the range of 345 to 385 million euros  and we maintain our commitment to distribute at least 80% of the Group’s net income2 for the 2024 financial year.”Group business activity in 2023- LNG carriers: Order momentum continuesAfter a record year in 2022 in terms of order intake  GTT booked 73 LNG carrier orders in the financial year 2023  21 of which were booked in the fourth quarter. Their delivery is scheduled between the first quarter of 2026 and the third quarter of 2029.An order for two very large ethane carriers was booked in the fourth quarter of 2023  with delivery scheduled between the fourth quarter of 2026 and the second quarter of 2027.Additionally  in early 2023  an order was booked for an LNG liquefaction unit (FLNG)  which is scheduled for delivery in the first quarter of 2027.Also  in the first two months of 2024  GTT booked two orders for a total of 23 LNG carriers – including eight very-large capacity carriers – as well as an order for three very large ethane carriers.- LNG as fuelIn July 2023  GTT received an order from the Chinese shipyard Yangzijiang to design the cryogenic tanks for ten LNG-powered very large container ships.In September 2023  a new order for five large container ships was received from HD Hyundai Heavy Industries on behalf of Yang Ming  a Chinese ship-owner.Delivery of these container ships is scheduled between the second quarter of 2026 and the first quarter of 2028.- Two new agreements with shipyardsIn November 2023  GTT signed a Technical Assistance and Licensing Agreement with COSCO Shipping (Qidong) Offshore  a subsidiary of COSCO Shipping Corporation  and  in December 2023  a strategic cooperation agreement with the Chinese shipbuilding group  CSSC.- Services to vessels in operationIn May 2023  GTT signed a Technical Service Agreement with the maritime transportation company Eastern Pacific Shipping and its subsidiary Coolco to support them with the maintenance and operation of a fleet of 33 vessels (24 LNG carriers  six ethane carriers and three container ships).In October 2023  GTT announced that it had signed a service contract with the ship-owner CMA CGM for the maintenance and operation of 49 LNG-powered container ships. The contract includes on-site technical support from GTT teams during inspections  maintenance  repairs  operations and engineering services  as well as training and access to the HEARS® emergency hotline. The contract also includes solutions provided by Ascenz Marorka (see below).- Ascenz Marorka: New contracts and launch of new innovative solutionsDuring 2023  GTT pursued its strategy of developing new digital solutions for ship-owners and signed a number of important contracts  highlighting the increasing needs of ship-owners in this area.The innovative solutions and new services developed by Ascenz Marorka include:A maintenance-optimisation solution for LNG membrane tanks  known as the “Sloshing Virtual Sensor”  which has received an approval in principle from Lloyd’s Register. This solution is designed to extend the period between tank inspections by two years  while maintaining strict safety standards.The vessel-propeller Shaft Power Limitation (ShaPoLi) solution 3   which has obtained conformity certification from DNV and Bureau Veritas. This solution aims to help ship-owners and operators comply with International Maritime Organization (IMO) regulations.  which has obtained conformity certification from DNV and Bureau Veritas.

The setting up of the Real-Time Fleet Performance Monitoring Centre  which brings together a team of maritime experts with in-depth knowledge of navigation  meteorology  performance management  LNG operations and offshore operations  to provide a holistic approach to optimise vessel operations.Notable contracts signed by Ascenz Marorka in 2023 include:A contract with two major European LNG ship-owners to equip three vessels with its “Sloshing Virtual Sensor” predictive maintenance solution  which is designed to optimise tank maintenance  while ensuring compliance with strict safety standards  thereby improving operational flexibility and achieving substantial savings.Four contracts for its Smart Shipping solution: the first with a European ship-owner  to equip 30 container ships; the second with GasLog  to equip its entire fleet of more than 35 LNG carriers; the third  with Global Ship Lease  to equip its entire fleet of container ships; and the fourth  with Brunei Gas Carriers  to equip the first vessel in its fleet. The Smart Shipping solution developed by Ascenz Marorka comprises automatic data collection systems and smart software designed to manage and optimise vessels’ energy and environmental performance.A contract to equip the entire Clean Products Tankers Alliance (CPTA) fleet – i.e. approximately 20 vessels – with its advanced weather routing solution.A contract to equip 49 CMA CGM LNG-powered vessels with high-frequency data collection systems  with access to Ascenz Marorka online platform.- ElogenIn terms of sales  Elogen continues to implement its selective approach to projects  while posting strong growth in revenues (up 117% to 10.1 million euros at December 31  2023). In the past financial year  EBITDA showed a controlled level of loss  given the increase in headcounts (+50 employees over the period)  to stand at -19.7 million euros  compared to -14.7 million euros in 2022. The Group notes that Elogen’s EBITDA is expected to break even from mid-decade.In early 2023  Elogen won a flagship contract with CrossWind – a joint venture between Shell and Eneco – to build a 2.5 MW electrolyser for an offshore wind farm off the coast of the Netherlands.In July 2023  Elogen signed its first contract with its Korean partner Valmax for the construction of a 2.5 MW electrolyser. In September 2023  Elogen signed a new contract with Valmax for the construction of a second 2.5 MW electrolyser. With a production capacity of up to one tonne of hydrogen per day each  these two electrolysers will be integrated into mobility projects in Korea.In December 2023  Elogen  the CNRS and the University of Paris-Saclay announced the creation of a joint laboratory to facilitate the large-scale production of green hydrogen by improving existing electrolysis processes and conducting research on the use of different materials.Elogen continues to implement its strategy around three imperatives: “Be efficient  be reliable  be ready”. Within this framework  Elogen is developing its R&D activities to improve the competitiveness and energy efficiency of its solutions  diversifying its technologies to produce large-scale electrolysers and continuing the development of its network of local partners for Balance-Of-Plant assembly and maintenance. The company is also strengthening its teams  particularly those involved in technical fields and project management. Finally  Elogen is gearing up for industrial scale-up with its Vendôme gigafactory project (part of the Hydrogen IPCEI). Construction began in January 2024.- Development of new technologiesInnovations in the field of LNG carriersAt the start of 2023  GTT obtained several approvals in principle for the adoption of new technologies in the LNG carrier field. A notable example was from Lloyd’s Register for a new LNG carrier design in collaboration with Samsung Heavy Industries  incorporating the three-tank concept developed by GTT and equipped with the Mark III Flex membrane containment system.Innovations in the field of LNG-fuelled vessels/alternative fuelsIn 2023  GTT obtained numerous approvals in principle from classification societies  especially in the area of alternative fuels. The approvals cover the following concepts:A dual-fuel  LNG-powered supertanker (ABS  ClassNK  Bureau Veritas  DNV and Lloyd’s’ Register);A dual-fuel LNG-powered Suezmax supertanker (ABS  DNV);An LNG tank with an “NH 3 ready” rating (ClassNK  DNV);ready” rating (ClassNK  DNV); An LNG tank allowing a pressure of up to one barg for LNG-as-fuel applications (ABS);And the RecycoolTM system  applied to LNG-powered vessels  which reliquefies excess boil-off gas to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve economic performance (ClassNK).The Group also obtained a 4.66 million euros subsidy from Bpifrance for the design of an on-board CO 2 capture system for vessels  and the development of smart digital ship-management solutions by OSE Engineering4 (a subsidiary of the GTT Group)  as part of the MerVent project5.Developments in the field of liquid hydrogen transportationIn July 2023  GTT received an approval in principle from ClassNK for a new membrane containment system concept for the transport of liquefied hydrogen.As previously announced in April 2023  GTT  TotalEnergies  LMG Marin and Bureau Veritas signed an agreement for a joint development project aimed at developing a concept for a liquid hydrogen carrier with a capacity of 150 000 m3  equipped with GTT’s membrane containment system. In January 2024  this project received two approvals in principle from Bureau Veritas: one for the design of a cryogenic membrane containment system for liquefied hydrogen  and the other for the preliminary design of the hydrogen carrier. These approvals mark the first major achievement in the development of a liquid hydrogen transport sector.PatentsIn 2023  the GTT Group filed 64 patents.- GTT Strategic VenturesIn September 2023  the GTT Group’s investment fund  GTT Strategic Ventures  announced an investment in the technology company ‘bound4blue’ to support the development of wind-assisted propulsion technology for ships.

GTT  the technological expert in membrane containment systems used to transport and store liquefied gases  today announces its results for the 2023 financial year.Commenting on the results  Philippe Berterottière  Chairman and CEO of GTT  said: “With a total of 73 LNG carrier orders  two ethane carrier orders  and one FLNG unit order in the financial year 2023  the commercial performance of our core business remains buoyant. Demand for LNG remains particularly high and sustainable  as borne out by the number of final investment decisions for new liquefaction plants – involving substantial volumes – that were confirmed at the beginning of the financial year. Continued strong demand for LNG  coupled with the construction of new liquefaction plants  will continue to fuel further demand for LNG carriers. In addition  with the ageing of fleets and the introduction of new environmental regulations  the replacement market is expected to grow in the coming years.For LNG as fuel  GTT booked 15 orders in 2023  with commercial momentum benefitting from a return to normal LNG spot prices.In 2023  Ascenz Marorka was awarded several major contracts with leading ship-owners  highlighting the relevance of our digital solutions. Furthermore  we are also announcing today the acquisition of VPS  a Danish company specialising in ship performance management.Finally  Elogen  our subsidiary specialising in PEM electrolysers for green hydrogen production  posted a strong increase in revenues.

The auction was jointly led by Singapore’s ...,EDP Renewables (Euronext: EDPR)  a global leader in renewable energy development  has been awarded Phase 8 of the SolarNova program  a Singapore public tender to select a developer of distributed solar energy. The auction was jointly led by Singapore’s Housing and Development Board and Singapore’s Economic Development Board.The company commits to deliver a minimum tender capacity of 130 MWp with the potential to achieve to 200MWp of solar capacity with this project. It is expected to install more than 320 000 solar panels across 1 075 Singapore public housing buildings and 101 government-owned buildings  which include 55 public schools.This is the largest initiative under the SolarNova program  a Government-led initiative  focusing on accelerating the deployment of solar photovoltaic systems in Singapore. EDPR was the only developer chosen to deploy the solar installations in this phase.It is also the third SolarNova tender EDPR has won  and it will also act as a platform to trial new innovative concepts such as Advanced Regeneration that can extend the lifespan of a solar panel up to five years and maximize power output.With this award  EDPR actively contributes to Singapore’s target of at least 2 GWp of solar deployment by 2030 and reflecting the attractive growth opportunities for EDPR in the APAC region.Once fully operational  the project will collectively power over 50 000 four-room flats and potentially reduce carbon emissions by more than 96 000 metric tonnes annually. The energy generated from the solar panels on public housing buildings will be used to fully power common services during the day.The SolarNova 8 project is a testament to our position as a leading renewables player in Singapore  while also driving benefits such as employment and economic growth. We aim to set new benchmarks in innovation and environmental stewardship  contributing with meaning and purpose to Singapore’s clean energy landscape  said Pedro Vasconcelos  EDP Renewables APAC Chief Operational Officer (COO).Singapore’s national climate target is to attain net-zero emissions by 2050 and solar stands out as one of the key catalysts driving this ambitious agenda. The SolarNova 8 award positions EDPR at the forefront of this transformative journey. Aligned with the nation’s vision for a low-carbon future  the success of this initiative underscores the company’s commitment to the energy transition. Recognizing the pivotal role of solar innovation in shaping a more environmentally conscious and resilient energy landscape  EDPR remains dedicated to advancing Singapore’s decarbonization efforts and contributing to a cleaner  greener  and more sustainable future.The Housing & Development Board (HDB) is Singapore’s public housing authority. It plans and develops Singapore’s housing estates; building homes and transforming towns to create a quality living environment for all. It also provides various commercial  recreational  and social amenities in our towns for our residents’ convenience. Today  more than 1 million flats have been completed in 24 towns and 3 estates across Singapore. HDB flats are home to about 80% of Singapore’s resident population  of which about 90% own their homes. For more information  please visit http://www.hdb.gov.sgLaunched in 2014  the SolarNova Programme is a Whole-of-Government effort led by the Economic Development Board (EDB) and HDB to accelerate the deployment of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems in Singapore. Under the SolarNova programme  HDB aggregates public sector demand for the installation of solar panels across HDB blocks and government sites.Having surpassed its earlier solar target of 220 megawatt-peak (MWp) by 2020  HDB had in 2019 announced a new solar target of 540 MWp by 2030. The new target could potentially generate 648 GWh of clean energy annually  contributing towards the national solar targets of 1.5 gigawatt-peak (GWp) by 2025  and 2 GWp by 2030 as set out under the Singapore Green Plan.Note: EDP Renewables APAC  formerly known as Sunseap  won two out of eight tenders  namely SolarNova 1 in 2015 and SolarNova 4 in 2019  putting solar photovoltaic systems atop about 2 400 public housing buildings. The SolarNova 8 win marks the third win by the company in the series. The SolarNova program will generate an estimated 420 GWh of solar energy annually. This is about 5% of Singapore’s total energy consumption or equivalent to powering 88 000 public housing flats.EDP Renewables APAC is headquartered in Singapore and has a pan-regional presence with more than 1.3 GWp of committed solar capacity as of December 2023. It is part of EDP Renewables (Euronext: EDPR)  a global leader in the renewable energy sector with 16.6 GW installed capacity as of December 2023 across Europe  North America  South America and Asia Pacific.
