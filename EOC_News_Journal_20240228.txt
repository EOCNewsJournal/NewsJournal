Stahl AG / Key word(s): Investment/MiscellaneousR. STAHL writes off its investment in ZAVOD Goreltex in full28-Feb-2024 / 14:52 CET/CESTDisclosure of an inside information acc. to Article 17 MAR of the Regulation (EU) No 596/2014  transmitted by EQS News - a service of EQS Group AG.The issuer is solely responsible for the content of this announcement.R. STAHL writes off its investment in ZAVOD Goreltex in fullWaldenburg  28 February 2024 - The Executive Board of R. STAHL AG today took the decision to fully write off its 25 percent investment in the Russian company ZAVOD Goreltex Co. Ltd.  St. Petersburg.Following the conversion of 75 percent of the shares of the previous majority owner (“Global Invest”) in ZAVOD Goreltex to ownership of the Russian Federation  the risk of the expropriation of R. STAHL’s minority shareholding has increased significantly. For this reason  based on current developments  the Executive Board of R. STAHL AG no longer assumes that the value of R. STAHL AG’s investment in ZAVOD Goreltex is recoverable. The investment will be fully impaired to its carrying amount of € 10.3 million in R. STAHL AG’s consolidated financial statements for 2023. The impairment will have a negative impact on the financial result. This step does not affect liquidity and has no impact on EBITDA pre exceptionals. Currency translation effects of € -3.2 million  which were previously recognized directly in equity due to the at-equity accounting of the investment  will be recognized in the financial result. In financial year 2023  these two transactions will lead to a non-cash charge of € 13.5 million on the R. STAHL Group’s net profit.Explanations of the key financial figures used can be found on page 25 of the 2022 Annual Report of the R. STAHL Group on the Internet at: https://r-stahl.com/en/global/corporate/investor-relations/ir-news-and-publications/financial-reports/About R. STAHL - www.r-stahl.comR.

This decrease was primarily due to a decline in normalized operating result  partially offset by a lower translation loss of €25 million compared to a translation loss of €36 million in Q4 2022 (Q3 translation gain of €3 million).Net earnings for the fourth quarter 2023 included a negative impact of €9 million (net of tax) relating to PPA expenses (Q4 2022 €8 million). Details of (estimated) amortization and earn-out expenses (PPA expenses) relating to the 2022 acquisitions of LPE and Reno are found in Annex 2.Comment“2023 was another successful year for ASM. Sales increased by 13% at constant currencies  despite softening market conditions  and marking the seventh consecutive year of double-digit growth.” said Benjamin Loh  CEO of ASM. “Revenue in Q4 2023 amounted to €633 million  in line with our guidance of €600-640 million and down compared to the level in Q4 2022. Revenue in the quarter was supported by strong sales in the power/analog/ wafer segment. Bookings at €678 million were slightly better than our expectation and were driven by GAA pilot- line orders and continued strength in China demand.Our full-year revenue increased to a record-high level of €2.6bn  outperforming the WFE market which was slightly down in 2023. Our sales dropped in memory in 2023  reflecting significant cuts in investment in this segment  and despite relatively healthy demand for high-performance DRAM. The leading-edge logic/foundry segment was also lower in 2023  impacted by weak end-market conditions and delays in some new customers’ fab  as already reported earlier in 2023. This was offset by strong growth in the mature node market segments: in power/analog/wafer  and in mature logic/foundry  particularly in China. Our silicon carbide (SiC) Epi business grew strongly in 2023  comfortably meeting the revenue target of more than €130 million in 2023  and with synergies already paying off. In the fourth quarter of 2023  two more customers selected our latest 200mm SiC Epi tool  with multiple tool orders expected in 2024.Normalized gross margin increased to 49.3% in 2023  supported by mix  including a substantial increase in sales from China with above-average profitability. Free cash flow increased by 17% in 2023 (on an adjusted basis  excluding cash spent on acquisitions in 2022)  even with a further increase in capex.We remain on track towards our strategic targets and continue to invest in our people  in innovation and expansion. In December  we announced to invest in a new state-of-the-art R&D center in Scottsdale  Arizona. It will be twice as big as the current R&D facility  in Phoenix  Arizona  and will enhance our ALD and Epi product- development efforts.We also made further progress in accelerating sustainability in 2023. A highlight was the verification of our Net Zero by 2035 targets by SBTi in August 2023  a first in the semiconductor industry. In addition  we increased the use of renewable electricity from 73% to 88% in 2023  and we remain on track to achieve 100% by 2024.”OutlookWhile the broader semiconductor market is expected to recover in 2024  the softer WFE market conditions we saw in the second half of 2023 are expected to continue into the first part of 2024. For the first quarter of 2024  we expect revenue of €600-640 million  with a similar level in the second quarter. For the second half of 2024  we expect revenue to be up compared to the level in the first half year  but it is too early to provide more specific guidance for the second half or for the full year. Looking at the expectations for WFE demand  memory and leading-edge logic/foundry demand is expected to gradually recover in the course of 2024. The revenue contribution from the Chinese market is expected to be still relatively high in the first part of the year  but likely to normalize in the rest of the year. For our SiC Epi business  we expect a continued strong performance in 2024. We expect ASM to benefit from an expected rebound of the WFE market in 2025. Based on this  we remain confident ASM revenue will increase to the forecasted range for 2025 (€3.0-3.6 billion). The move of GAA 2nm technology into high-volume manufacturing in 2025 is expected to be a significant driver for ASM.Benjamin Loh to retire  Hichem M’Saad to succeed him as new CEOASM announced on February 12  2024  that CEO Benjamin Loh will retire and step down as per the AGM on May 13  2024. He will be succeeded by Hichem M’Saad  currently member of the Management Board and CTO.ASM announced €300M expansion of U.S. operations in Scottsdale  ArizonaASM announced on December 5  2023  its plans for a new North American expansion to accommodate growing demand for research and development in the semiconductor industry.ASM is investing €300 million over a period of up to five years to design and construct the new state-of-the-art site on more than 20 acres (8.5 hectares) in Scottsdale  Arizona. This total investment is a combination of capital expenditures related to infrastructure and lab equipment  and includes operational expenses such as the additional research and engineering jobs created with the expansion.Share buyback programASM announces today that its Management Board authorized a new repurchase program of up to €150 million of the company's common shares within the 2024/25 timeframe. This buyback program will be executed by intermediaries and will end as soon as the aggregate purchase price of the common shares acquired by ASM has reached €150 million.Dividend proposalASM will propose to the forthcoming 2024 Annual General Meeting on May 13  2024  to declare a regular dividend of €2.75 per common share over 2023  increased from the regular dividend paid over 2022 (€2.50 per common share).About ASM InternationalASM International N.V.  headquartered in Almere  the Netherlands  and its subsidiaries design and manufacture equipment and process solutions to produce semiconductor devices for wafer processing  and have facilities in the United States  Europe  and Asia.

Global gre…,"Tyneside operation aiming for eight tonnes of green hydrogen per day  serving industrial and transport sectorsSupporting net zero ambitions by cutting thousands of tonnes of CO2Nantes (France)  27 February 2024  7.30am CET. Global green and renewable hydrogen pioneer Lhyfe has today unveiled plans for its first UK plant to support the country's net zero ambitions.The company's proposed facility in the North East of England is receiving support from Shepherd Offshore  a leading maritime and energy service provider  following the signing of a land deal.If plans are approved  Lhyfe's facility on the brownfield site of the historic Neptune Bank Power Station in Wallsend  North Tyneside  would have an initial capacity of 20 megawatts (MW)  capable of producing up to eight tonnes of green hydrogen per day.As an equivalent  eight tonnes would enable a hydrogen truck to travel approximately 100 000 km without emitting any CO2. With the same quantity  a car could go around the Earth 20 times or travel around 800 000 km.Named Lhyfe Wallsend  this plant aims to supply a range of organisations seeking to decarbonise their manufacturing and transport operations.Lhyfe (EURONEXT: LHYFE) is one of the world's pioneers in the production of green and renewable hydrogen through water electrolysis  with its units being powered by green electricity. Water is fed into the electrolyser  which is split into hydrogen and oxygen meaning the only by-product is oxygen.The France-based multinational's first plant in Pays de la Loire  Western France  has been operational since the 2nd half of 2021  with two more sites inaugurated in the Occitanie and Brittany regions in December 2023.Several other sites are currently under construction or extension across Europe.The announcement comes 18 months after Lhyfe launched its UK subsidiary  headquartered in Newcastle  to meet the increasing demand from companies aiming to reduce their reliance on natural gas and other fossil fuels.In the UK  Lhyfe aims to become a major supplier to energy-intensive industries and transportation  boosting the country's energy security and creating new economic opportunities.It also has ambitions to develop offshore hydrogen production  tapping into the huge offshore wind potential the UK offers.The proposed plant will occupy 4 acres of leased industrial-zoned land along the north bank of the River Tyne.This site was once part of the Neptune Bank Power Station  an early 20th-century pioneer in high-voltage power distribution and a model for the National Grid.Lhyfe Wallsend will use green electricity from the grid  complying with the UK Low Carbon Hydrogen Standard. The company is also exploring options to source power from local renewable assets  such as solar and wind.Lhyfe's proposed plant is receiving support from Shepherd Offshore  a company that has more than 40 years of experience as leading UK service providers  developing and operating facilities  and supporting world-class manufacturing on the north bank of the River Tyne. Shepherd Offshore has also extensively redeveloped Neptune and Swans Energy Park. The company offers over 1 700 meters of quay frontage and more than 200 acres of overall capacity on the north bank of the Tyne.Lhyfe is in advanced talks with several energy-intensive businesses in the area and across the UK  including those with transport fleets that could use hydrogen in their operations.Companies and sectors looking to decarbonise are encouraged to contact Lhyfe to discuss opportunities to collaborate.Lhyfe's planning application will be submitted to North Tyneside Council in the spring  with a programme of community engagement underway.The project is subject to obtaining notably building permission and a financial investment decision.Taia Kronborg  Chief Business Officer at Lhyfe  said: “We are excited to announce North Tyneside as the site for our first UK green hydrogen production project. The development of green hydrogen projects is critical if major energy users are to decarbonise their operations. We hope this project will not only help the North East but the whole of the UK reach its net zero targets.“At Lhyfe  we are demonstrating that green hydrogen is now a reality and a key driver of the clean energy transition. We have a strong ethos of working with partners and communities to create projects that deliver real local value  and this is a key focus in growing our operations in line with demand.”Charles Shepherd  Managing Director at Shepherd Offshore  said: “We at Shepherd Offshore are excited to announce the partnership with Lhyfe on the hydrogen production facility in Wallsend. Shepherd Offshore is fully committed to yet another critical milestone in the growing strength and evolution of the River Tyne and looks forward to welcoming Lhyfe to the north bank of the Tyne.”About Green HydrogenHydrogen is a gas that emits no carbon dioxide when it is used  but its carbon footprint varies depending on how it is made. Lhyfe's green and renewable hydrogen is produced from a process of electrolysis of water  in production units powered by renewable electricity.Water is fed into the electrolyser  which is split into hydrogen and oxygen meaning the only by-product is oxygen.The hydrogen is compressed and transported locally from the production unit  providing an alternative to fossil fuels.About LhyfeLhyfe is a European group devoted to energy transition  and a producer and supplier of green and renewable hydrogen. Its production sites and portfolio of projects intend to provide access to green and renewable hydrogen in industrial quantities  and enable the creation of a virtuous energy model capable of decarbonising entire sectors of industry and transport.In 2021  Lhyfe inaugurated the first industrial-scale green hydrogen production plant in the world to be interconnected with a wind farm. In 2022  it inaugurated the first offshore green hydrogen production pilot platform in the world. In 2023  it inaugurated its second and third sites  and currently has several sites under construction or expansion across Europe. Lhyfe is represented in 12 European countries and had 195 staff at the end of December 2023. The company is listed on the Euronext market in Paris (ISIN: FR0014009YQ1 – LHYFE).Lhyfe.comClick to access the Lhyfe Media Kit (press kit and visuals)About Shepherd OffshoreShepherd Offshore is one of the UK's leading service providers  developing and operating facilities while supporting world class manufacturing within the North East of England  based on the North Bank of the River Tyne.The success and influence of Shepherd Offshore is shared across the North East economy.

The Spanish listed company Lleida.net (BME:LLN) (EPA:ALLLN) (OTCQX:LLEIF) presents this week at the Mobile World Congress two solutions to put an end to fraud and forgery of electronic signatures.The presence of electronic signatures is on the rise  as is their fraud  which is already a major problem in the digital society. This trend compromises the authenticity and integrity of information and digital documentation  in addition to triggering legal problems and identity forgery.In response to this problem  Lleida.net has developed over the last two years two specific solutions: the USVC and Certvalidator  which will be presented at the Mobile World Congress 2024 starting this Monday  February 26th.The USVC (Universal Signature Validator Certificate) is the first universal validator of electronic signatures.

CASE 2 The Investor chooses not to convert any bonds into stocks.The Company chooses to redeem all the bonds in stocks at the current floor price of 3.2796 euros  then the issuance of 2 383 420 new shares for the First Tranche and 1 702 443 for the Second Tranche. CASE 3 The Investor chooses not to convert any bonds into stocks.The Company chooses to redeem all the bonds in stocks at the new floor price of 1 euro  then the issuance of 7 816 666 new shares for the First Tranche and 5 583 333 for the Second Tranche.RISK FACTORSRisks related to financing obtained in the form of convertible bondsCrossject has set up a financing arrangement with convertible bonds purchased by Heights and  once it has received the stocks resulting from the conversion or exercise of these instruments  does not intend to remain a stockholder in the company.Stocks resulting from the conversion or exercise of the securities mentioned above will generally be sold on the market very quickly  which can create strong downward pressure on the stock price.Stockholders may suffer a loss of their invested capital due to a significant decrease in the company's stock value and significant dilution due to the large number of securities issued to Heights.Investors are advised to exercise extreme caution before deciding to invest in a listed company's securities that carry out such dilutive financing transactions  particularly when carried out successively.Crossject would like to point out that this is not its first financing transaction with a dilutive impact.In addition  the financing agreement concluded with the Investor includes repayment clauses:(1) In the event of a default or change of control (cf. above)(2) Crossject has undertaken to submit a resolution to a vote at its next General Meeting (which must be held no later than June 31st 2024  or  failing that  September 30th 2024) in order to remove the floor price to 1 euro.Failing this  the Investor shall be entitled to require Crossject to repurchase all or part of the stocks held by it (“Investor Put Option”) at a price equal to the greater of the following amounts: (i) 102% of the principal amount outstanding and (ii) 120% of parity.This put option will be exercisable within 30 days from the date of the announcement of the votes of the second general meeting.General risksInvestors are invited to take into consideration the risk factors described in the 2022 annual report (and the entirety of this report) and in the 2023 half-yearly report (available on the Company's website: www.crossject.com).Crossject (ISIN: FR0011716265; Stock symbol: ALCJ (Euronext:LEI; www.crossject.com) is developing and will soon market a portfolio of drugs for use in emergency situations: epilepsy  overdose  allergic shock  severe migraine  and asthma attack. Thanks to its patented needle-free auto-injector  Crossject aims to become the world leader in self-administered emergency drugs. The company has been listed on the Euronext Growth Paris market since 2014  and receives financing  including from the American BARDA (Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority) and Bpifrance.1 Based on the lowest volume-weighted average daily price of the Company's stocks over the last five (5) trading days prior the issuance of each tranche of bonds.2 The closing of the transaction will take place on Wednesday  February 28  2024  subject to the satisfaction of usual conditions.3 Natural or legal persons (including companies)  investment firms  trusts  investment funds or other investment vehicles of any kind  governed by French or foreign law  that invest or have invested on a regular basis in the pharmaceutical  biotechnology  medical or innovative technologies sector4 See the press release from 6 February  20245 cf. chapter “Impact of the issuance on stockholders currently holding 1% of crossject capital stock”6 Minimum price equal to 3.2796 euros  pursuant to the delegation granted by the 13th extraordinary resolution of the Combined General Meeting of June 7th 2023. The Company has undertaken to submit a resolution to its next General Meeting of Stockholders to amend the price limit for the issue of new stocks in connection with the amortization of the convertible bonds to one (1) euro per stock 7At an amount equal to the greater of (i) 120% of the outstanding principal amount of the convertible bonds together with accrued but unpaid interest and (ii) the greater of (A) the product of (x) the Market Price on the date and (y) such number of shares per bond as would have been required to be issued and delivered in respect of such bond had the conversion right been exercised in respect thereof and (B) the product of (x) the outstanding principal amount of each bond and (y) Parity (fraction having as numerator the Market Price on this date and for denominator 85% of the Market Price on the date of the last instalment payment)  it being specified that in case of change of control  the company may return new shares.Attachment",neutral,0.02,0.98,0.0,positive,0.63,0.35,0.01,True,English,"['two tranches', 'Crossject', 'financing', 'Euronext Growth BPI France Innovation', 'Euronext Growth Paris', 'Euronext Growth Allshare', '13th extraordinary resolution', 'United States Food', 'status epilepticus seizures', 'United States Government', 'real estate sale', '2023 Research Tax Credit', '969500W1VTFNL2D85A65 Listing type', 'current floor price', 'preferential subscription rights', 'maximum overall budget', 'initial reference price', 'Combined General Meeting', 'Executive Board meeting', 'Emergency Use Authorization', 'other non-dilutive financing', 'specialty pharma company', 'Heights Capital Management', 'CROSSJECT STOCK CODES', 'capital stock', 'emergency situations', 'Initial Investment', 'conversion price', 'Supervisory Board', 'new capital', 'current funding', 'Stock symbol', 'stock market', 'two tranches', 'needle-free auto-injectors', 'new stock', 'nominal value', 'growing companies', 'market progress', 'North America', 'advanced development', 'ZENEO-midazolam autoinjector', 'Drug Administration', 'future prospects', '$60 million worth', 'primary objective', 'limited dilution', 'leaseback transaction', 'commercial revenues', 'existing partnerships', 'Patrick Alexandre', 'Reuters code', 'Bloomberg code', 'continuous Indexes', 'holding limit', 'partial drawdown', 'due date', 'first repayment', '70 amortizable bonds', '70 Convertible Bonds', 'new shares', 'maximum financing', 'maximum amount', 'First Tranche', 'Second Tranche', 'conversion premium', 'usual conditions', 'following conditions', 'cash repayment', 'January 31st', 'AMF approval', 'twelve (12) months', 'ALCJ.FP', '6.3 million euros', 'February 28th', 'institutional investor', 'Crossject stocks', '36 months', '1,359,434 stocks', '2,383,420 stocks', '7,816,666 stocks', '100,000 euros', '5.1492 euros', '3.8142 euros', '3.2796 euros', 'Dijon', '8:30am', 'entity', 'options', 'rate', 'issue', 'category', 'investors3', 'June', 'decision', 'member', 'sub-delegation', 'sign', 'confidence', 'industrial', 'funds', 'addition', 'BARDA', 'contract', 'name', 'ZEPIZURE', 'FDA', 'treatment', 'supply', 'product', 'form', 'solutions', 'time', 'CEO', 'ISIN', 'LEI', 'EnterNext', 'PEA-PME', 'Number', 'securities', 'STRUCTURE', 'OPERATION', 'initiative', 'compliance', 'issuance', 'rise', 'Prospectus', 'Characteristics', 'cancellation', 'persons', 'benefit', 'delivery', 'satisfaction', 'event', 'adjustment', 'amortization', 'obligation', 'total']",2024-02-27,2024-02-28,marketscreener.com

Double-digit full-year revenue growth  outperforming softer WFE market in 2023 Financial highlights € m…,Almere  The Netherlands February 27  2024  6 p.m. CETASM International N.V. (Euronext Amsterdam: ASM) today reports its fourth quarter 2023 operating results (unaudited).Double-digit full-year revenue growth  outperforming softer WFE market in 2023Financial highlights€ million Q4 2022 Q3 2023 Q4 2023 New orders 828.6 627.4 677.5 YoY change % at constant currencies 26% 0% (14%) Revenue 724.8 622.3 632.9 YoY change % at constant currencies 42% 9% (7%) Normalized gross profit margin 1 46.9% 48.9% 47.9% Normalized operating result 1 189.8 157.2 141.0 Normalized operating result margin 1 26.2% 25.3% 22.3% Share in income of investments in associates (excluding amortization intangible assets resulting from the sale of ASMPT stake 2013)8.30.42.2 Amortization intangible assets (resulting from the sale of ASMPT stake in 2013)(3.5)(0.1)(0.1) Reversal of impairment of investments in associates 106.1 0.0 0.0 Net earnings 236.6 129.6 90.9 Normalized net earnings 2 142.4 139.1 100.31 Excluding amortization of fair value adjustments from purchase price allocations (before tax)2 Excluding amortization of fair value adjustments from purchase price allocations (net of tax)  change in fair value of the contingent consideration (LPE earn-out) and impairment reversal of ASMPTNew orders of €678 million for the fourth quarter 2023 representing a decrease of 14% over the same period last year on a constant currency basis (decreased by 18% as reported).Year-on-year revenue decrease for the fourth quarter 2023 was 7% at constant currencies (decreased by 13% as reported).Normalized gross profit margin of 47.9%  improved compared to 46.9% in the same quarter last year  mainly explained by mix  including a continued strong contribution from China sales.Normalized operating result for the fourth quarter 2023  decreased from €190 million last year to €141 million this year  largely explained by lower sales and increased operating expenses (€13 million).Normalized net earnings for the fourth quarter 2023 were €100 million  down from €142 million in Q4 last year. This decrease was primarily due to a decline in normalized operating result  partially offset by a lower translation loss of €25 million compared to a translation loss of €36 million in Q4 2022 (Q3 translation gain of €3 million).Net earnings for the fourth quarter 2023 included a negative impact of €9 million (net of tax) relating to PPA expenses (Q4 2022 €8 million). Details of (estimated) amortization and earn-out expenses (PPA expenses) relating to the 2022 acquisitions of LPE and Reno are found in Annex 2.Comment“2023 was another successful year for ASM. Sales increased by 13% at constant currencies  despite softening market conditions  and marking the seventh consecutive year of double-digit growth.” said Benjamin Loh  CEO of ASM. “Revenue in Q4 2023 amounted to €633 million  in line with our guidance of €600-640 million and down compared to the level in Q4 2022. Revenue in the quarter was supported by strong sales in the power/analog/ wafer segment. Bookings at €678 million were slightly better than our expectation and were driven by GAA pilot- line orders and continued strength in China demand.Our full-year revenue increased to a record-high level of €2.6bn  outperforming the WFE market which was slightly down in 2023. Our sales dropped in memory in 2023  reflecting significant cuts in investment in this segment  and despite relatively healthy demand for high-performance DRAM. The leading-edge logic/foundry segment was also lower in 2023  impacted by weak end-market conditions and delays in some new customers’ fab  as already reported earlier in 2023. This was offset by strong growth in the mature node market segments: in power/analog/wafer  and in mature logic/foundry  particularly in China. Our silicon carbide (SiC) Epi business grew strongly in 2023  comfortably meeting the revenue target of more than €130 million in 2023  and with synergies already paying off. In the fourth quarter of 2023  two more customers selected our latest 200mm SiC Epi tool  with multiple tool orders expected in 2024.Normalized gross margin increased to 49.3% in 2023  supported by mix  including a substantial increase in sales from China with above-average profitability. Free cash flow increased by 17% in 2023 (on an adjusted basis  excluding cash spent on acquisitions in 2022)  even with a further increase in capex.We remain on track towards our strategic targets and continue to invest in our people  in innovation and expansion. In December  we announced to invest in a new state-of-the-art R&D center in Scottsdale  Arizona. It will be twice as big as the current R&D facility  in Phoenix  Arizona  and will enhance our ALD and Epi product- development efforts.We also made further progress in accelerating sustainability in 2023. A highlight was the verification of our Net Zero by 2035 targets by SBTi in August 2023  a first in the semiconductor industry. In addition  we increased the use of renewable electricity from 73% to 88% in 2023  and we remain on track to achieve 100% by 2024.”OutlookWhile the broader semiconductor market is expected to recover in 2024  the softer WFE market conditions we saw in the second half of 2023 are expected to continue into the first part of 2024. For the first quarter of 2024  we expect revenue of €600-640 million  with a similar level in the second quarter. For the second half of 2024  we expect revenue to be up compared to the level in the first half year  but it is too early to provide more specific guidance for the second half or for the full year. Looking at the expectations for WFE demand  memory and leading-edge logic/foundry demand is expected to gradually recover in the course of 2024. The revenue contribution from the Chinese market is expected to be still relatively high in the first part of the year  but likely to normalize in the rest of the year. For our SiC Epi business  we expect a continued strong performance in 2024. We expect ASM to benefit from an expected rebound of the WFE market in 2025. Based on this  we remain confident ASM revenue will increase to the forecasted range for 2025 (€3.0-3.6 billion). The move of GAA 2nm technology into high-volume manufacturing in 2025 is expected to be a significant driver for ASM.Benjamin Loh to retire  Hichem M’Saad to succeed him as new CEOASM announced on February 12  2024  that CEO Benjamin Loh will retire and step down as per the AGM on May 13  2024. He will be succeeded by Hichem M’Saad  currently member of the Management Board and CTO.ASM announced €300M expansion of U.S. operations in Scottsdale  ArizonaASM announced on December 5  2023  its plans for a new North American expansion to accommodate growing demand for research and development in the semiconductor industry.ASM is investing €300 million over a period of up to five years to design and construct the new state-of-the-art site on more than 20 acres (8.5 hectares) in Scottsdale  Arizona. This total investment is a combination of capital expenditures related to infrastructure and lab equipment  and includes operational expenses such as the additional research and engineering jobs created with the expansion.Share buyback programASM announces today that its Management Board authorized a new repurchase program of up to €150 million of the company's common shares within the 2024/25 timeframe.

This project illustrates Bilendi's ability  which very few players can boast  to offer the services and technologies needed to manage surveys taking place simultaneously in a very large number of countries (up to 70) and in every language.Objectives reaffirmed for 2026:Bilendi is reaffirming its aggressive growth strategy combining development and targeted acquisitions with the aim of achieving sales of 100 M€ by 2026  and EBITDA of 20% to 25% of sales  i.e.  20 to 25 M€.Next publication: results for the 2023 financial year will be published on 3 April 2023 (after market close)About BilendiAt a time when the volume  variety and speed of data transmitted and exchanged are increasing exponentially  Bilendi provides an innovative technological response to data collection  management and enhancement.

Specifically tailored to meet the rigorous requirements of institutional investors  the ETC Group Ethereum Staking ETP offers superior outcomes compared to alternative staking offerings and other similar ETPs on the market. It is the first real institutional-grade  low-cost  liquid  and transparent staking ETP  anchored to a genuine benchmark to ensure optimal investor outcomes.Tracking the Compass Ethereum Total Return Monthly Index as benchmarkEther (ETH) is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. ETH Staking ETPs are investment vehicles that provide exposure to Ether's price appreciation and as well as additional yield in the form of staking rewards that are reinvested into the ETP. By tracking a robust and transparent benchmark in the Compass Ethereum Total Return Monthly Index  investors – for the first time – can accurately evaluate performance against ETH staking market-wide rates and benefit from the lowest total cost and highest yielding Ethereum Staking ETP on the market.Staking is a way to generate income for crypto asset owners. When investors pledge their cryptocurrency to validate transactions on a Proof of Stake (PoS) blockchain network such as Ethereum  they contribute to the security of the blockchain and receive additional tokens as rewards. In many ways staking is similar to dividends in equities. More information can be found in the digital assets staking guide recently released on the website of the company.The ETP has a maximum management fee of 0.65%. In addition to ETH price action  investors in ET32 earn the full ETH staking rewards less a staking service fee of 10% deducted from the total rewards. Rewards earned are reinvested into the ETP  further benefitting investors. The ETH staking yield market rate is currently 3.5% but subject to change  driven by factors including activity on the network and the total amount of Ethereum being staked.Focus on investor returns and investor safetyThere are many different ways to stake ETH. Chanchal Samadder  Head of Product at ETC Group  points out that the key factors determining the staking solution are transparency  cost  operational efficiency  liquidity  accessibility  and treatment of rewards.“With investor outcomes in mind  ETC Group carefully considered all elements and designed what we believe to be the best Ethereum Staking product on the market  with the greatest transparency  lowest total cost  and highest staking rewards.” Samadder concludes.Investors can trade the new ETP like shares or ETFs via their securities account at online brokers and banks that offer trading on XETRA and trading in crypto ETPs. The Ethereum Staking ETP is underpinned by the same institutional grade security and risk management expertise applied to all ETC Group products. It is fully backed by the underlying digital assets  and counterparty risk is negated through an independent trustee. The digital assets backing the ETP are safely kept in cold storage by a market-leading specialised institutional custodian  Zodia Custody  and staked through the leading blockchain infrastructure provider  Blockdaemon. All transactions are additionally monitored independently by a dedicated administrator with veto rights on each transaction  a unique feature developed by ETC Group to minimize operational risk and eliminate the possibility of white-collar crime within the product cycle.The product offers investors a cost-efficient  regulated and secure way to tap into the benefits of Ethereum staking and diversify crypto asset portfolios.Samadder commented: “As institutional investors grow their internal crypto capabilities and teams  we are seeing a deeper appreciation for the key differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum  which in our view are highly complementary assets and should both form the cornerstone of any allocation to digital assets. With ET32 we strongly believe we have delivered the first institutional grade vehicle to capture the full economic opportunity of Ethereum  including its staking benefits.”ET32 Trading InformationETP name Primary listing exchange Primary ticker ISIN WKN Trading currency ETC GroupEthereum Staking ETP Deutsche Börse XETRA ET32 DE000A3G90G9 A3G90G EUR ETC GroupEthereum Staking ETP Deutsche Börse XETRAET33 DE000A3G90G9 A3G90G USDKey product features include:Low annual management fee of 0.65%.Highest reward pass through to investors  90% of all rewards passed to investors.The only product tracking a real total return benchmark  for the first time offering transparency of returns to investors.More information about the product will be provided upon listing on the respective product page at www.etc-group.com.The full ETC Group product list including all exchange listings and trading information is available at https://etc-group.com/products/.- Ends -Cryptocurrencies are highly volatile  and your capital is at risk.

The initial feedback from the market is encouraging. Combogesic® IV represents a significant innovation in pain management  offers effective pain relief and importantly provides clinicians a valuable alternative to opioid analgesics.”Hyloris is entitled to a milestone payment of USD 1 1 million  in addition to the USD 1 million that became due upon product manufacturing  which occurred in December 2023.Approval of Maxigesic® IV in CanadaMaxigesic® IV has recently been granted marketing authorization by Health Canada.Canada1 is facing a significant public health crisis related to opioid use with debilitating consequences for individuals  families  and communities. 22 Canadians die on average each day from apparent opioid toxicity. Between 2022 and 2023  health systems have seen an 11% year over year increase in the number of opioid-related hospitalizations. Beyond the human toll  the opioid crisis has significantly impacted Canada's economy  costing an estimated CAD 3 5 billion across healthcare  law enforcement  and lost productivity.Stijn Van Rompay added: “When launched  it will fill the critical need for post-surgical pain management between inadequate non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and habit-forming opioids.”About the opioid pandemic in the U.S.The opioid pandemic in the U.S. is a critical healthcare issue  with chronic opioid use after surgery being one of the most common post-operative complications2. The devastating consequences are reflected in the prevalence of new chronic opioid use post-surgery in the U.S. In the past 2 decades  prescription opioid usage in the U.S. contributed to over 600 000 deaths related to opioid overdoses  with the annual death toll rising tenfold between 1999 and 2021. In 2021 alone approximately 80 000 deaths were attributed to opioid overdoses  with nearly involving prescription opioids. The economic impact is also substantial  as patients requiring medical attention related to opioid abuse contribute around USD 11 billion in added costs to the U.S. healthcare system annually  constituting 1% of all hospital costs.About Maxigesic® IVMaxigesic® IV is a unique combination of 1000mg paracetamol with 300mg ibuprofen solution for infusion (in a 100 ml bottle) for use post-operatively. Results from a randomised  double-blind  placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial in 276 patients following bunion surgery demonstrated that Maxigesic® IV was well-tolerated and had a faster onset of action and offered higher pain relief compared to Ibuprofen IV or Paracetamol IV alone in the same doses.Moreover  the superior analgesic effect of Maxigesic® IV was supported by a range of secondary endpoints  including reduced opioid consumption compared to the Paracetamol IV and Ibuprofen IV treatment groups (p-value < 0.005). Hyloris holds several patents for the U.S. market  with the latest expiring in 2038.Maxigesic® IV is  to date  licensed in over 100 countries  approved in over 40 countries and marketed in over 20 countries.About Hyloris Pharmaceuticals SAHyloris is a specialty biopharma company focused on innovating  reinventing  and optimizing existing medications to address important healthcare needs and deliver relevant improvements for patients  healthcare professionals and payors.The Company’s development strategy primarily focuses on leveraging established regulatory pathways  such as the FDA’s 505(b)2 pathway in the U.S or equivalent regulatory frameworks in other regions which are specifically designed for pharmaceuticals for which safety and efficacy of the molecule have already been established. This approach can reduce the clinical burden required for market entry  and significantly shorten the development timelines  leading to reduced costs and risks.Hyloris has built a broad  patented portfolio of 18 reformulated and repurposed value-added medicines that have the potential to offer significant advantages over existing alternatives. Two products are currently in early phases of commercialization in collaboration with commercial partners: Sotalol IV for the treatment of atrial fibrillation  and Maxigesic® IV  a non-opioid post-operative pain treatment. In addition to its core strategic focus  the Company has 1 approved high barrier generic product launched in the U.S. and 2 high barrier generic products in development.Hyloris is based in Liège  Belgium.

The only global event in this field  it allows researchers and professionals from the world of art and heritage to come together to exchange and debate current issues. This will be a major event for France in 2024  ranking among the most important events of the year such as the Paris Olympics.This year  the French Committee for the History of Art (CFHA) was chosen to organize it. The International Congress of Art History will be held at the Convention Center of the Cité Internationale de Lyon from June 23 to 28  2024:https://www.cihalyon2024.fr/en/Artprice by Artmarket Headquarters at The Museum of Contemporary Art ""Abode of Chaos"" dixit NYT (Lyon – France)[ https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2024/02/image1-artprice-by-artmarket-headquarters-at-the-museum-of-contemporary-art-abode-of-chaos-dixit-NYT-lyon-france.jpg ]36th CIHA World Congress - Lyon 2024 - Endorsed by the French Ministry of Culture  the French Ministry of Higher Education and Research  and the French Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs[ https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2024/02/image2-36-th-ciha-world-congress-lyon-france.png ]thierry Ehrmann  President of Artmarket.com and Founder of Artprice: “It is clear that Artprice's sponsorship of this global event  which will be pivotal for France and its international cultural policy  is significant. With over 50 countries and 1000 speakers participating  particularly in this Olympic Games year of 2024  the event holds immense importance. This exceptional event focusing on the History of Art  held once every four years  underscores France's resurgence  as it reclaims  according to Artprice  its position as the leading European hub in the Art Market.”The theme chosen for the 36th edition is “Matter Materiality”. This theme concerns all artistic productions from all periods of art history. Their materiality poses problems of perception  conservation  or reproduction.This theme allows us to question the effects of dematerialization due to digital technology  but also the material dimension of digital technology such as the techniques of rematerialization or perception of materiality. It explores very current questions  in full evolution  and in line with major societal  ecological  and ethical challenges.The congress will address many techniques and categories of material objects  from painting to print  from architectural techniques to the use of waste  from the human body to clothing  and more  as detailed in the online program ( in progress):https://openagenda.com/en/ciha-2024Olivier Bonfait  President of the French Committee for Art History (CFHA)  organizer of CIHA 2024: “Coming to this international congress in Lyon means participating in a great celebration of knowledge in Art History  being present at one of those events that (almost) never happen. The last CIHA congress in France took place in… 1989. We are working intensively to make this exceptional event a success. And Artprice's sponsorship carries its full meaning in this edition.”Nearly 1 000 participants from more than 50 countries will speak during the congress. There will be a program of plenary conferences with the greatest specialists and world-renowned artists where they will talk about their approach to the subject. Artprice and the Organe Museum of Contemporary Art will participate in workshops in the form of collaborative knowledge-sharing sessions. In the evening  discussions will continue during events organized with partner museums and foundations.A special evening will be organized at the world headquarters of Artprice by Artmarket  in the heart of the Organe Museum of Contemporary Art managing La Demeure du Chaos / Abode of Chaos (dixit The New York Times)  including a visit to its unique in the world historical documentary collection dating from 1700 to the present day.

The Company continues to experience consistent double-digit expansion. Strong growth was observed in key markets such as Benelux  the Baltics and the Balkans in 2023  with other countries also showing promising growth trends.93 8% of Unifiedpost Group's total year-to-date revenue is recurring  highlighting the Company's strong and consistent revenue stream.The non-recurring digital processing revenue decreased by 17 5% y/y. Projects for corporates in this segment performed well in 2023  achieving a growth rate of 7 9% compared to the previous year. The revenue from licenses was lower due to delayed decisions coming from postponed legislations. However  this revenue is anticipated to materialise in the future.Improved contributions and operational challengesIn 2023  the digital business segment showed an improvement in contribution  with a €6 million increase compared to 2022. This growth was achieved through a combination of revenue expansion and effective cost management practices. The contribution from the Postage & Parcel Optimisation segment remained relatively stable  experiencing only a marginal decrease of €0 1 million.During 2022 and 2023  the Company diligently pursued cost reduction initiatives  yielding favourable results. These efforts were impacted by inflation and wage indexation. Additionally  two one-time elements influenced the outcome: firstly  the Company decided to put all non-core applications in maintenance and expense all Research and Development (R&D) of those  resulting in a negative impact on costs in 2023 without any cash implications. Secondly  there were one-time costs totalling €2 million  primarily attributed to lay-offs and consulting fees related to divestment activities.Impairment result[INSIDE INFORMATION] It was determined that an impairment of €39 million is necessary  this is a non-cash event. This impairment test was influenced by two key factors. Firstly  there was a rise in the cost of capital due to increased interest rates  impacting our financial calculations. Secondly  the future business plans faced setbacks due to delays in the legal requirement for e-invoicing  which forced the Company to make changes to our anticipated plans and forecasts.Group’s operating and financial resultThe Group's loss from operations excluding the impairment improved by €3 million  from a loss of €29 9 million in 2022 to €26 9 million in 2023. In total  with the impairment of €39 million  the total loss from operations for 2023 amounted to €65 9 million. The financial costs  income tax and loss on equity method of the Group  which amounted to €17 2 million in 2023  resulted in a total loss of €83 1 million. Within these financial costs lies a non-cash expense related to Francisco Partners amounting to €10 8 million.Unifiedpost continues investment in R&D for future growthUnifiedpost recognises the importance of staying ahead in our dynamic market.

Our financing activities resulted in a negative cash flow of €11 6 million during 2023. Overall  the Group realised a negative cash flow of €13 7 million for the year  excluding any divestments.Starting the year with €40 million in cash  after accounting for cash flow results  we ended the year with €26 3 million in cash.The Group successfully met its cash objective in the fourth quarter of 2023. The overall result for H2 still revealed a modest negative balance of €1 7 million (adjusted for restructuring costs). Thanks to the cost-cutting measures implemented over the past two years  we have positioned ourselves with a cost base that provides a solid foundation for future cash flow generation.Streamlining operations for continued profitable and cash-flow positive growthThroughout 2023  we have successfully reduced our workforce by 189 full-time equivalents (FTEs) through careful evaluation and optimisation of our organisational structure. The R&D team remains at the core with 380 FTE’s at YE  securing the future growth.

Moving forward  we remain committed to optimising our workforce to better align with our strategic objectives.The divestment of FitekIn/Onea  announced on August 1st  is still pending completion. However  we anticipate the closing to occur in the very near term. This transaction involves €7 2 million in cash. Additionally  we are actively exploring or working on other divestments to streamline the Group's operations and refocus on core business activities. This initiative aims to enhance our strategic focus and drive sustainable growth.Changes in Unifiedpost Group's Board of DirectorsMr. Joost Uwents resigned from all his mandates within the Company  effective December 31  2023  due to commitments arising from his other professional activities.

Germany: additional details regarding their plans for B2B e-invoicing have been provided  emphasising the use of XRechnung and ZUGFeRD formats. Implementation is expected to commence in January 2025  with mandatory e-invoicing for large companies starting from 2026. Croatia: plans are underway to implement mandatory B2B e-invoicing by 2026. France: updated timelines have been announced for the upcoming mandatory e-invoicing regulations. While the French Senate has approved a revised timetable for the implementation with a gradual roll-out starting from 1 July 2025  an amendment has been introduced by the government to restore the 2026 timing. Poland: the mandatory rollout of e-invoicing has been indefinitely postponed. The implementation of EU 'ViDa' e-invoicing and e-reporting has been delayed until at least 2030  allowing more time for preparations and adjustments.These regulatory updates underscore the dynamic nature of the European market and highlight the importance of staying informed about changes to ensure compliance and strategic alignment. Unifiedpost remains committed to leveraging these developments to drive growth and innovation  while simultaneously prioritising short-term objectives such as further improving its cash flow and optimising business operations.About Unifiedpost GroupUnifiedpost is a leading cloud-based platform for SME business services built on “Documents”  “Identity” and “Payments”.

The Company continues to experience consistent double-digit expansion. Strong growth was observed in key markets such as Benelux  the Baltics and the Balkans in 2023  with other countries also showing promising growth trends.93 8% of Unifiedpost Group's total year-to-date revenue is recurring  highlighting the Company's strong and consistent revenue stream.The non-recurring digital processing revenue decreased by 17 5% y/y. Projects for corporates in this segment performed well in 2023  achieving a growth rate of 7 9% compared to the previous year. The revenue from licenses was lower due to delayed decisions coming from postponed legislations. However  this revenue is anticipated to materialise in the future.Improved contributions and operational challengesIn 2023  the digital business segment showed an improvement in contribution  with a €6 million increase compared to 2022. This growth was achieved through a combination of revenue expansion and effective cost management practices. The contribution from the Postage & Parcel Optimisation segment remained relatively stable  experiencing only a marginal decrease of €0 1 million.During 2022 and 2023  the Company diligently pursued cost reduction initiatives  yielding favourable results. These efforts were impacted by inflation and wage indexation. Additionally  two one-time elements influenced the outcome: firstly  the Company decided to put all non-core applications in maintenance and expense all Research and Development (R&D) of those  resulting in a negative impact on costs in 2023 without any cash implications. Secondly  there were one-time costs totalling €2 million  primarily attributed to lay-offs and consulting fees related to divestment activities.Impairment result[INSIDE INFORMATION] It was determined that an impairment of €39 million is necessary  this is a non-cash event. This impairment test was influenced by two key factors. Firstly  there was a rise in the cost of capital due to increased interest rates  impacting our financial calculations. Secondly  the future business plans faced setbacks due to delays in the legal requirement for e-invoicing  which forced the Company to make changes to our anticipated plans and forecasts.Group’s operating and financial resultThe Group's loss from operations excluding the impairment improved by €3 million  from a loss of €29 9 million in 2022 to €26 9 million in 2023. In total  with the impairment of €39 million  the total loss from operations for 2023 amounted to €65 9 million. The financial costs  income tax and loss on equity method of the Group  which amounted to €17 2 million in 2023  resulted in a total loss of €83 1 million. Within these financial costs lies a non-cash expense related to Francisco Partners amounting to €10 8 million.Unifiedpost continues investment in R&D for future growthUnifiedpost recognises the importance of staying ahead in our dynamic market. To ensure our solutions remain innovative and competitive  we continue to invest in the development of our offerings. With a dedicated R&D team of 380 full-time employees at YE  Unifiedpost remains at the forefront of technological advancements. These investments not only keep our solutions cutting-edge but also position the Company for future growth.Unifiedpost Group achieves positive cash flow momentum in 2023Our focus on cash flow has yielded significant improvement in 2023. In 2022  the combined operational and investing cash flow resulted in a negative balance of €43 7 million. This has improved substantially in 2023  with just a €2 1 million negative result. Our financing activities resulted in a negative cash flow of €11 6 million during 2023. Overall  the Group realised a negative cash flow of €13 7 million for the year  excluding any divestments.Starting the year with €40 million in cash  after accounting for cash flow results  we ended the year with €26 3 million in cash.The Group successfully met its cash objective in the fourth quarter of 2023. The overall result for H2 still revealed a modest negative balance of €1 7 million (adjusted for restructuring costs). Thanks to the cost-cutting measures implemented over the past two years  we have positioned ourselves with a cost base that provides a solid foundation for future cash flow generation.Streamlining operations for continued profitable and cash-flow positive growthThroughout 2023  we have successfully reduced our workforce by 189 full-time equivalents (FTEs) through careful evaluation and optimisation of our organisational structure. The R&D team remains at the core with 380 FTE’s at YE  securing the future growth. Workforce reductions have been implemented without compromising the core development of our future-oriented services or the support we provide to our valued customers. Moving forward  we remain committed to optimising our workforce to better align with our strategic objectives.The divestment of FitekIn/Onea  announced on August 1st  is still pending completion. However  we anticipate the closing to occur in the very near term. This transaction involves €7 2 million in cash. Additionally  we are actively exploring or working on other divestments to streamline the Group's operations and refocus on core business activities. This initiative aims to enhance our strategic focus and drive sustainable growth.Changes in Unifiedpost Group's Board of DirectorsMr. Joost Uwents resigned from all his mandates within the Company  effective December 31  2023  due to commitments arising from his other professional activities.

This development underscores the importance of preparing for upcoming changes in 2024 and 2025. Following Belgium's implementation  France will implement e-invoicing requirements starting from 2026  with other countries like Germany and Spain to follow. These regulatory shifts are reshaping the business landscape  emphasising the need for digitalisation and compliance with evolving standards across European markets.

Germany: additional details regarding their plans for B2B e-invoicing have been provided  emphasising the use of XRechnung and ZUGFeRD formats. Implementation is expected to commence in January 2025  with mandatory e-invoicing for large companies starting from 2026. Croatia: plans are underway to implement mandatory B2B e-invoicing by 2026. France: updated timelines have been announced for the upcoming mandatory e-invoicing regulations. While the French Senate has approved a revised timetable for the implementation with a gradual roll-out starting from 1 July 2025  an amendment has been introduced by the government to restore the 2026 timing. Poland: the mandatory rollout of e-invoicing has been indefinitely postponed. The implementation of EU 'ViDa' e-invoicing and e-reporting has been delayed until at least 2030  allowing more time for preparations and adjustments.These regulatory updates underscore the dynamic nature of the European market and highlight the importance of staying informed about changes to ensure compliance and strategic alignment.

Our turnover rose +6.0% at constant FX over the year due to an excellent first half  client retention which remained at record highs and an increase of service revenues. Business information revenue was up +23.4% in the last quarter  with FY growth of +17.3%  confirming this activity’s growth potential.Annual net income under IFRS 17 was stable at €240m thanks to an excellent underwriting margin  leading to an annualised RoATE of 13.4% despite the negative impact of the fall of certain foreign currencies (Argentina  Turkey) and a drop in real estate prices  which affected our net income.In an increasingly uncertain environment  Coface’s teams confirmed their dedication to and their high level of expertise at the service of our clients.We will propose a dividend of €1.30 per share at the Shareholders’ Meeting  representing a payout ratio of 81%3. This is in line with the ambitions of the Build to Lead strategic plan – the objectives of which have all been met or exceeded. We will present our new strategic plan 2024 - 2027  on 5 March.”Key figures at 31 December 2023The Board of Directors of COFACE SA approved the consolidated financial statements at 31 December 2023 at its meeting of 27 February 2024.

TurnoverIn 2023  Coface recorded a consolidated turnover of €1 868.2m  up +6.0% compared to 2022 at constant FX and perimeter. As reported (at current FX and perimeter)  turnover rose +3.8%.Revenues from insurance activities (including surety bonds and single risk) increased by +5.4% at constant FX and perimeter. Growth benefited from a rise in client activity in the first half of the year  but this fell into negative territory in the second half following a decline in inflation and the economic slowdown. The retention rate reached a record level of 93.1% (up +0.2% compared to 2022). Buoyed by an increase in demand  new business rose to €117m  up €7m compared to 2022.The growth in Coface’s client activities had a positive impact of +2.3% during 2023. However  this growth reflects the slowdown of the economy and inflation (-11.5 ppts compared to 2022). The price effect remained negative  coming in at -1.9% for FY-23 (compared to -3.0% for FY-22) and stabilised in Q4-23. This is largely due to very low past losses offset by the current normalisation environment.Turnover from non-insurance activities was up +10.3% compared to 2022. All the business lines are experiencing positive growth. Turnover from factoring rose +2.6%  mainly due to the increase in volumes refinanced in Germany (+3.9%). Revenues from information services continued to grow  rising +17.3% (+23.4 in Q4-23). Fee and commission income (debt collection commissions) increased +42.1% due to the increase in claims to be collected. Commissions were up +8.7%.Total revenue - in €m(by country of invoicing) 2022 2023 Variation % ex.

The region saw a slump in client activity  but adjacent activities were on the rise. Factoring turnover rose by +3.9%.In Western Europe  turnover increased +5.9% at constant FX (+5.7% at current FX). Client activities were resilient and information sales increased.In Central and Eastern Europe  turnover fell -4.5% at constant FX (-2.7% at current FX) due to the decline in business in Russia. Excluding Russia  growth would be +1.3%.In the Mediterranean and Africa region  which is driven by Italy and Spain  turnover rose +12.4% at constant FX and +8.6% at current FX on the back of strong sales performance.In North America  turnover increased +5.6% at constant FX and +2.1% as reported  driven by the return in client activity and rising commissions.In Latin America  turnover increased +11.1% at constant FX and fell -0.5% at current FX. The region saw a slump in client activity  mainly in commodities and metals  and the consequences of the devaluation of the Argentine peso.In Asia-Pacific  turnover increased +5.2% at constant FX and +2.0% at current FX. The boost in revenue was driven by past sales performances  which sustained the growth of the portfolio  and high retention rates.2. ResultCombined ratioThe combined ratio net of reinsurance was 64.3% for the year  improved by 3.3 ppts year on year. The combined ratio net of reinsurance for Q4-23 stood at 59.0%  improved by 14.4 ppts year on year  and 7.8 ppts compared to Q3-23.(i) Loss ratioThe gross loss ratio stood at 35.8%  up 0.3 ppt compared to the previous year. This reflects an increased claims frequency since H1-21  with the number of claims nearing pre COVID levels. The amount of claims recorded is now higher than in 2019. Lastly  large losses have become relatively significant in size again while remaining below the historical average.The Group’s provisioning policy remained unchanged. The amount of provisions related to the underwriting year  although discounted  remained in line with the historical average. Strict management of past claims enabled the Group to record 47.1 ppts of recoveries.The net loss ratio improved to 37.7%  down 2.0 ppts compared to 2022.(ii) Cost ratioCoface follows a strict cost management policy. Coface remained disciplined throughout 2023  with costs rising 7.0% at constant FX and perimeter (+4.0% in Q4-23). This increase was slightly more than growth in revenue over the year (6.0%) due to ongoing investment. The cost ratio before reinsurance stood at 31.5%  down 0.2 ppt despite slowed revenue growth due to an improvement in the product mix.In 2023  the cost ratio net of reinsurance was 26.6%  an improvement of 1.4 ppt year on year due to the improved gross ratio and reinsurance commissions that remain high.Financial resultNet financial income came to +€12.4m in 2023. This amount includes market value adjustments for -€21.9m (including -€28.9m on real estate funds)  positive hedging results and a currency effect for -€38.7m. This FX effect was due to the major devaluation in Argentina and the application of IAS 29 (Hyperinflation) in Turkey.The portfolio’s current yield (i.e. excluding capital gains  depreciation and FX) was €64.9m. The accounting yield5  excluding capital gains and fair value effect  was 2.1% for 2023. The yield on new investments was 3.9%.In 2023  Insurance Finance Expenses (IFE) stood at €40.0m due to higher discount rates and higher loss reserves on the balance sheet.Operating income and net incomeOperating income amounted to €362.9m in 2023  up 1.6%.The effective tax rate was 27% (27% in 2022).In total  net income (group share) stood at €240.5m  stable compared to 2022 under IFRS 17  of which €50.8m in Q4-23.3. Shareholders’ equityAt 31 December 2023  Group shareholders’ equity stood at €2 050.8m  up €32.2m or +1.6% (€2 018.6m at 31 December 2022).This change was mainly due to the positive net income of €240.5m  the payment of the dividend (-€227.0m) and the increase in unrealised capital gains (€25.0m).The annualised return on average tangible equity (RoATE) was 13.4% at 31 December 2023  mainly due to the improvement in underwriting income.The solvency ratio reached 199%6  representing an decrease of 2 ppts compared to FY-22. It remains well above the upper end of the target range (155%-175%). The solvency ratio excludes the debt that will be repaid in March 2024.Coface will propose €1.30 dividend per share  corresponding toa payout ratio of 81%7 to shareholders at the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting  in line with its capital management policy.4. OutlookThe most pessimistic scenarios for 2023 did not materialise. While the Chinese economy continued to disappoint  the United States continued to surprise on the upside. The economic impact of higher interest rates was delayed in an environment of full employment and still strong corporate balance sheets.The most notable point of the year was the generalised decline in inflation through the second half of the year due to proactive coordinated actions of central banks and the fall of energy prices despite an increasingly tense geopolitical environment.For 2024  Coface anticipates a drawn-out soft landing for the global economy  with growth expected at +2.2% after +2.6% in 2023. Downside risks are real  in particular due to the unprecedented number of political elections in the world  culminating with the US presidential election at the end of the year.As expected  business failures continued to rise  sometimes above pre-pandemic levels. However  the many preventive measures taken by Coface so far avoided a spike in recorded claims. While the number of claims has not yet reached 2019 levels  the total claims amount is now equivalent.In 2023  Coface’s IFRS 17 results were stable against the previous year  once again demonstrating Coface’s resilience in a challenging environment. This year marks the end of the Build to Lead strategic plan  with all its objectives having been met or exceeded. Coface will present its new strategic plan 2024 - 2027  which will build on the success of the Build to Lead plan  on 5 March 2024.Conference call for financial analystsCoface’s results for FY-2023 will be discussed with financial analysts during the conference call on 28 February 2024 at 11.00 (Paris time).

Our turnover rose +6.0% at constant FX over the year due to an excellent first half  client retention which remained at record highs and an increase of service revenues. Business information revenue was up +23.4% in the last quarter  with FY growth of +17.3%  confirming this activity’s growth potential.Annual net income under IFRS 17 was stable at €240m thanks to an excellent underwriting margin  leading to an annualised RoATE of 13.4% despite the negative impact of the fall of certain foreign currencies (Argentina  Turkey) and a drop in real estate prices  which affected our net income.In an increasingly uncertain environment  Coface’s teams confirmed their dedication to and their high level of expertise at the service of our clients.We will propose a dividend of €1.30 per share at the Shareholders’ Meeting  representing a payout ratio of 81%3.

TurnoverIn 2023  Coface recorded a consolidated turnover of €1 868.2m  up +6.0% compared to 2022 at constant FX and perimeter. As reported (at current FX and perimeter)  turnover rose +3.8%.Revenues from insurance activities (including surety bonds and single risk) increased by +5.4% at constant FX and perimeter. Growth benefited from a rise in client activity in the first half of the year  but this fell into negative territory in the second half following a decline in inflation and the economic slowdown. The retention rate reached a record level of 93.1% (up +0.2% compared to 2022). Buoyed by an increase in demand  new business rose to €117m  up €7m compared to 2022.The growth in Coface’s client activities had a positive impact of +2.3% during 2023. However  this growth reflects the slowdown of the economy and inflation (-11.5 ppts compared to 2022). The price effect remained negative  coming in at -1.9% for FY-23 (compared to -3.0% for FY-22) and stabilised in Q4-23. This is largely due to very low past losses offset by the current normalisation environment.Turnover from non-insurance activities was up +10.3% compared to 2022. All the business lines are experiencing positive growth. Turnover from factoring rose +2.6%  mainly due to the increase in volumes refinanced in Germany (+3.9%). Revenues from information services continued to grow  rising +17.3% (+23.4 in Q4-23). Fee and commission income (debt collection commissions) increased +42.1% due to the increase in claims to be collected. Commissions were up +8.7%.Total revenue - in €m(by country of invoicing) 2022 2023 Variation % ex.

The region saw a slump in client activity  but adjacent activities were on the rise. Factoring turnover rose by +3.9%.In Western Europe  turnover increased +5.9% at constant FX (+5.7% at current FX). Client activities were resilient and information sales increased.In Central and Eastern Europe  turnover fell -4.5% at constant FX (-2.7% at current FX) due to the decline in business in Russia. Excluding Russia  growth would be +1.3%.In the Mediterranean and Africa region  which is driven by Italy and Spain  turnover rose +12.4% at constant FX and +8.6% at current FX on the back of strong sales performance.In North America  turnover increased +5.6% at constant FX and +2.1% as reported  driven by the return in client activity and rising commissions.In Latin America  turnover increased +11.1% at constant FX and fell -0.5% at current FX. The region saw a slump in client activity  mainly in commodities and metals  and the consequences of the devaluation of the Argentine peso.In Asia-Pacific  turnover increased +5.2% at constant FX and +2.0% at current FX. The boost in revenue was driven by past sales performances  which sustained the growth of the portfolio  and high retention rates.2. ResultCombined ratioThe combined ratio net of reinsurance was 64.3% for the year  improved by 3.3 ppts year on year. The combined ratio net of reinsurance for Q4-23 stood at 59.0%  improved by 14.4 ppts year on year  and 7.8 ppts compared to Q3-23.(i) Loss ratioThe gross loss ratio stood at 35.8%  up 0.3 ppt compared to the previous year. This reflects an increased claims frequency since H1-21  with the number of claims nearing pre COVID levels. The amount of claims recorded is now higher than in 2019. Lastly  large losses have become relatively significant in size again while remaining below the historical average.The Group’s provisioning policy remained unchanged. The amount of provisions related to the underwriting year  although discounted  remained in line with the historical average. Strict management of past claims enabled the Group to record 47.1 ppts of recoveries.The net loss ratio improved to 37.7%  down 2.0 ppts compared to 2022.(ii) Cost ratioCoface follows a strict cost management policy. Coface remained disciplined throughout 2023  with costs rising 7.0% at constant FX and perimeter (+4.0% in Q4-23). This increase was slightly more than growth in revenue over the year (6.0%) due to ongoing investment. The cost ratio before reinsurance stood at 31.5%  down 0.2 ppt despite slowed revenue growth due to an improvement in the product mix.In 2023  the cost ratio net of reinsurance was 26.6%  an improvement of 1.4 ppt year on year due to the improved gross ratio and reinsurance commissions that remain high.Financial resultNet financial income came to +€12.4m in 2023. This amount includes market value adjustments for -€21.9m (including -€28.9m on real estate funds)  positive hedging results and a currency effect for -€38.7m. This FX effect was due to the major devaluation in Argentina and the application of IAS 29 (Hyperinflation) in Turkey.The portfolio’s current yield (i.e. excluding capital gains  depreciation and FX) was €64.9m. The accounting yield5  excluding capital gains and fair value effect  was 2.1% for 2023. The yield on new investments was 3.9%.In 2023  Insurance Finance Expenses (IFE) stood at €40.0m due to higher discount rates and higher loss reserves on the balance sheet.Operating income and net incomeOperating income amounted to €362.9m in 2023  up 1.6%.The effective tax rate was 27% (27% in 2022).In total  net income (group share) stood at €240.5m  stable compared to 2022 under IFRS 17  of which €50.8m in Q4-23.3. Shareholders’ equityAt 31 December 2023  Group shareholders’ equity stood at €2 050.8m  up €32.2m or +1.6% (€2 018.6m at 31 December 2022).This change was mainly due to the positive net income of €240.5m  the payment of the dividend (-€227.0m) and the increase in unrealised capital gains (€25.0m).The annualised return on average tangible equity (RoATE) was 13.4% at 31 December 2023  mainly due to the improvement in underwriting income.The solvency ratio reached 199%6  representing an decrease of 2 ppts compared to FY-22. It remains well above the upper end of the target range (155%-175%). The solvency ratio excludes the debt that will be repaid in March 2024.Coface will propose €1.30 dividend per share  corresponding toa payout ratio of 81%7 to shareholders at the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting  in line with its capital management policy.4. OutlookThe most pessimistic scenarios for 2023 did not materialise. While the Chinese economy continued to disappoint  the United States continued to surprise on the upside. The economic impact of higher interest rates was delayed in an environment of full employment and still strong corporate balance sheets.The most notable point of the year was the generalised decline in inflation through the second half of the year due to proactive coordinated actions of central banks and the fall of energy prices despite an increasingly tense geopolitical environment.For 2024  Coface anticipates a drawn-out soft landing for the global economy  with growth expected at +2.2% after +2.6% in 2023. Downside risks are real  in particular due to the unprecedented number of political elections in the world  culminating with the US presidential election at the end of the year.As expected  business failures continued to rise  sometimes above pre-pandemic levels. However  the many preventive measures taken by Coface so far avoided a spike in recorded claims. While the number of claims has not yet reached 2019 levels  the total claims amount is now equivalent.In 2023  Coface’s IFRS 17 results were stable against the previous year  once again demonstrating Coface’s resilience in a challenging environment.

I am very satisfied with how quickly and seamlessly Equans is integrating into the Bouygues group  and equally with the initial steps taken to roll out the strategic plan unveiled to the financial community in February 2023. The Bouygues group also made considerable progress in CSR in 2023. Each business segment has measurable  quantified targets relating to our key challenges. On the climate front  our decarbonisation targets are now documented and endorsed  while Equans is currently going through the endorsement process. The 10-eurocent increase in the dividend testifies to the Group’s ability to create value for its shareholders.”Full-year 2023 sales were €56 billion  up 26% versus 2022  driven mainly by Equans’ contribution. Sales growth was 3% compared with the 2022 proforma figure including Equans.

The ex-date and payment date have been set at 30 April and 3 May 2024  respectively.OUTLOOK FOR 2024The outlook below is based on information known to date.Outlook for the GroupIn 2024  Equans will continue to improve its results in line with its strategic Perform plan. Bouygues Immobilier will continue to face a challenging market environment  with low visibility on the timetable for recovery.In an uncertain economic and geopolitical environment  and after a year of strong growth  Bouygues is targeting sales and current operating profit from activities (COPA) for 2024 that are slightly up on 2023.Outlook for EquansIn 2024  Equans will continue to roll out its strategic plan. It will remain focused on improving performance in a supportive environment and will continue to prioritise margins over volume growth. The 2024 sales figure will be close to that of 2023  because it will factor in both the effects of growth in Equans’ markets and the scope effect related to the asset-based activity disposals at end-2023  and the selective approach to contracts strategy.As a reminder  Equans is aiming for:Sales: from 2025 onwards  an acceleration in organic sales growth to align with that of market peersMargin: In 2025  a current operating margin from activities (COPA margin) close to 4% In 2027  a current operating margin from activities (COPA margin) of 5%Cash: a cash conversion rate (COPA-to-cash flow8) before working capital requirements (WCR) of between 80% and 100%Outlook for Bouygues TelecomAs it continues to grow its customer base  particularly in the fixed segment  and maintains its investments to boost its mobile network  Bouygues Telecom’s guidance for 2024 is as follows:an increase in sales billed to customers;EBITDA after Leases of above €2 billion;gross capital expenditure at around €1.5 billion (excluding frequencies).Outlook for the TF1 groupIn line with TF1’s distribution policy disclosed in February 2023  the Board of Directors will propose to the General Meeting of Shareholders on 17 April 2024 the payment of a dividend of fifty-five cents per share  an increase of five eurocents or up 10% versus 2022.The TF1 group’s ambition is to establish itself as the go-to free-to-air destination for news and family entertainment in France.The TF1 group's outlook for 2024 is the following:keep growing in digital  building on the promising launch of TF1+;maintain a broadly stable current operating margin from activities  close to that of 2023;continue to generate solid cash flow  enabling the TF1 group to aim for a growing dividend policy over the next few years.DETAILED ANALYSIS BY SECTOR OF ACTIVITYCONSTRUCTION BUSINESSESAs a reminder  Bouygues Energies & Services has been consolidated within Equans since the start of 2023. For easier comparison  the 2022 data for the construction businesses presented below have been restated for Bouygues Energies & Services  as it contributed to Bouygues Construction’s figures.At end-December 2023  the backlog in the construction businesses (Bouygues Construction excluding Bouygues Energies & Services  Bouygues Immobilier and Colas) rose 4% year-on-year to €28.4 billion (up 7% at constant exchange rates and excluding principal disposals and acquisitions).Bouygues Construction’s order intake in 2023 was €10.6 billion  driven notably by the award of major contracts  which represented 50% of the full-year 2023 order intake. Examples include the Abidjan metro (first quarter  for around €770 million)  the Potomac River Tunnel in the US (fourth quarter  for around €480 million) and a metro line extension in Hong Kong (MTRC 1201  second quarter  for around €470 million). The normal course of business also remained steady. Bouygues Construction’s backlog (excluding Bouygues Energies & Services) stood at €15 billion at end-2023  up 6% year-on-year (up 9% at constant exchange rates and excluding principal disposals and acquisitions)  providing good visibility on future activity. This growth was driven by the Civil Works backlog (up 12% year-on-year) and the International Building backlog (up 5% year-on-year).Bouygues Immobilier is still contending with a challenging market environment. As such  residential property reservations were down 25% year-on-year. In France  block sales rose by 19%  representing 48% of reservations in 2023  versus 30% in 2022. Commercial property activity remains at a standstill as investor delay their decisions. In this context  Bouygues Immobilier is adapting its organisation and postponing the launch of a certain number of projects. Its backlog was 32% lower than at end-2022.Colas benefited from order intake of €13.7 billion. The backlog was €12.4 billion  up 6% year-on-year (up 9% at constant exchange rates and excluding principal disposals and acquisitions)  driven by International (up 6%) and France (up 7%) – especially Rail outside France  in connection with several major contracts which were awarded in the past year such as the extension of the NSCR line in Manila (worth around €660 million)  the Abidjan metro (around €330 million) and the Old Oak Common station in the United Kingdom (around €215 million). As a result  the Rail backlog was up 39% year-on-year. The Roads backlog was down 5% year-on-year (down 3% year-on-year like-for-like and excluding principal disposals and acquisitions).The construction businesses reported sales of €27.3 billion in 2023  up 2% year-on-year  driven by Bouygues Construction and Colas. Like-for-like and at constant exchange rates  sales increased 4%. Bouygues Construction’s sales rose 5%  lifted mainly by a strong performance from International Building (up 15%). Bouygues Immobilier’s sales declined 14%9 versus 2022  reflecting a challenging market environment (including the share of co-promotions  sales would have decreased 13%). Sales at Colas were up 3%  driven by Rail (up 6%) and to a lesser extent by Roads (up 3%) notably in EMEA  and rising 6% like-for-like and at constant exchange rates.The current operating profit from activities (COPA) in the construction businesses was €851 million at end-2023  up €70 million year-on-year  and the COPA margin in the construction businesses increased 0.2 points over the period to 3.1%.Over full-year 2023  Bouygues Construction’s COPA was €281 million  up slightly versus 2022. The margin from activities was 2.9%  very close to the level of 2022. Against a backdrop of a sharp decline in sales  Bouygues Immobilier’s COPA1 amounted to €28 million  a lower level than in 2022 (including the share of co-promotions  this figure would have been €56 million  at a similar level to that of 2022). At Colas  COPA was €542 million  an increase of €74 million versus 2022. This increase is notably supported by the United States  Canada and France. It includes the gain on a land sale in the United States during the third quarter. The margin from activities in 2023 was 3.4%  an improvement of 0.4 points year-on-year.GovernanceA change in governance has taken place at Bouygues Immobilier. On 19 February 2024  following the separation of the offices of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer:Emmanuel Desmaizières was appointed Chief Executive Officer of Bouygues Immobilier;Pascal Minault was appointed Chairman of Bouygues Immobilier.EQUANSEquans’ figures include Bouygues Energies & Services with effect from January 2023. The percentage changes shown below are a comparison with the proforma data for 2022  which include Equans and Bouygues Energies & Services before eliminations with Bouygues Construction. Equans’ proforma results for 2022  which were not audited  are provided for comparative purposes.In line with the announcements made at the Capital Markets Day in February 2023  Equans continued its selective approach to contracts  prioritising margins over volume growth in a supportive environment for its activities. Full-year order intake in 2023 amounted to €17.4 billion  reflecting significant order intake for data centres  construction of solar farms and gigafactories (electric vehicle batteries) in Europe and in the United States  as well as recurrent maintenance contracts for industrial sites and public buildings. The backlog  which includes Bouygues Energies & Services  was €24.8 billion at end-2023  down 4% versus end-December 2022  reflecting the selective approach to contracts strategy.Equans posted sales of €18.8 billion in 2023  reflecting positive market trends and factoring in the contribution of asset-based activities which were divested in late 2023. This can be compared with a proforma figure of €17.7 billion (unaudited) for 2022 and represents an increase of 6%. Current operating profit from activities (COPA) in 2023 was €545 million  an increase of €130 million versus the proforma 2022 figure  and reflects the continued roll-out of the Perform plan to all of Equans’ operating units. The margin from activities was therefore 2.9%  in the upper end of the range of between 2.5% and 3% announced at the Capital Markets Day in February 2023. Net surplus cash improved sharply in the period  driven by strong cash generation from operations  improvement in the change in WCR relating to operating activities and asset disposals.TF1TF1 group reported sales of €2.3 billion in 2023  representing an 8% decrease year-on-year (down 7% like-for-like and at constant exchange rates):Media sales fell 5% (down 2% like-for-like and at constant exchange rates  related to the disposal of Unify assets in 2022). Advertising revenue was down 4% year-on-year (-2% like-for-like)  but rose in second-half 2023 versus second-half 2022  reflecting a rebound in the advertising market driven by renewed adspend by certain advertisers and the Rugby World Cup  broadcast in September and October.Sales at Newen Studios declined by 23% year-on-year. The decline was due to an unfavourable comparison basis due to the delivery of flagship shows in 2022 (such as Liaison and Marie-Antoinette in third-quarter 2022)  the discontinuation of the Salto activity and the end of Plus Belle la Vie at France Télévisions. Newen also observed a slowdown in investment by international streaming platforms over the first nine months of the year.Current operating profit from activities (COPA) was €287 million  down €35 million year-on-year. The margin from activities was 12.5%  close to 2022  as expected. This was indicative of TF1’s tight control over programme costs  which amounted to €960 million (down €27 million year-on-year  or 3% lower)  in particular as a result of the decline in the advertising market during the first half of the year.Free cash flow before WCR stood at €178 million  confirming TF1’s ability to convert its results into cash. Net surplus cash stood at €505 million  an increase of €179 million year-on-year.BOUYGUES TELECOMBouygues Telecom continued expanding in both the mobile and fixed segments in 2023. At end-December 2023  mobile plan customers excluding MtoM totalled 15.5 million  thanks to the gain of 287 000 new customers since the start of the year  of which 71 000 in the fourth quarter. In fixed  FTTH customers were 3.6 million at end-December 2023  thanks to 574 000 new adds over the full year  of which 150 000 in the fourth quarter. The proportion of fixed customers subscribing to a FTTH plan continued to increase  reaching 73% versus 64% one year earlier. The total fixed customer base was 4.9 million  which was 232 000 more than at end-December 2022  of which an increase of 65 000 in the fourth quarter.Fibre performance is explained in particular by the sustained FTTH roll-out. Bouygues Telecom has reached its target of 35 million FTTH premises by end-2026  almost three years ahead of schedule.Within the framework of its fibre roll-out  Bouygues Telecom set up the SDAIF10 joint-venture (49% stake)  which is investing in fibre roll-out in Orange's part of the Medium Dense Area. In 2024  Bouygues Telecom will not exercise the call option  the first exercise period for which opens on 15 March 2024  which would enable it to lift its stake to 51% of this joint-venture.Sales billed to customers reflected this commercial momentum and reached €5.9 billion  up 5% versus 2022  lifted by the strength of the mobile and fixed customer bases and very robust ABPU11 (year-on-year  fixed ABPU rose €1.9 to €31.4 per customer per month  while mobile ABPU was stable at €19.7 per customer per month  as some customers migrated to cheaper plans  reflecting pressure on purchasing power).Sales from services rose 4% year-on-year  still held back by the decrease in sales from incoming traffic12. Other sales were slightly lower year-on-year  mainly due to a decrease in built-to-suit sales. In total Bouygues Telecom’s sales increased 3% versus 2022.EBITDA after Leases rose €196 million year-on-year to €1 969 million  driven by sales growth and continued tight control on costs. EBITDA after Leases margin was 32.9%  an increase of 2.1 points versus 2022.Current operating profit from activities (COPA) was €798 million  up €104 million year-on-year. Operating profit was €791 million and includes non-current income of €22 million.Gross capital expenditure excluding frequencies was €1 475 million at end-December 2023  in line with the target set for 2023.PUBLIC TENDER OFFER AND SQUEEZE-OUT FOR COLAS SHARESThe public tender offer followed by a squeeze out for the Colas shares not yet held by Bouygues  at a price of €175 per share  was followed by the delisting of Colas shares from the Euronext Paris regulated market on 22 December 2023.As of that date  Bouygues has held 100% of the share capital of Colas.FINANCIAL SITUATIONat €14.6 billion  the Group maintained a high level of liquidity  which comprised €4.9 billion in cash and equivalents  supplemented by €9.7 billion in undrawn medium- and long-term credit facilities;net debt at end-December 2023 was €6.3 billion  versus €7.5 billion at end-December 2022 13 . This change mainly reflected: the payment of dividends  the payment of €310 million 14 to Free Mobile  on 16 May 2023  in respect of which the Group is disputing the ruling and validity of its immediate execution 15   the disposal of asset-based activities at Equans  the squeeze-out of minority shareholders and subsequent delisting of Colas  the capital increase reserved for Bouygues employees  the change in the WCR relating to operating activities of +€1.1 billion. As previously announced  the change in the WCR relating to operating activities was -€0.6 billion in 2022. In the fourth quarter of 2023  the change in the WCR relating to operating activities was €3 billion  reflecting efforts made by the business segments;. This change mainly reflected: net gearing16 was 44% (versus 54% at end-2022).During 2023  Bouygues:renewed its medium- and long-term credit facilities as they expired  without financial covenants or rating clauses;redeemed a €700-million bond issue;repaid the syndicated loan arranged to finance the acquisition of Equans;issued several bonds for a total of €1 450 million.At end-December 2023  the average maturity of the Group’s bonds was 8.5 years  and the average coupon was 3.01% (average effective rate of 2.25%). The debt maturity schedule is well-spread over time  and the next bond redemption will be in October 2026.The Group’s long-term credit ratings by Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s of A3  stable outlook  and A-  negative outlook  respectively  were confirmed on 30 November 2023 and 11 December 2023.NON-FINANCIAL PERFORMANCEAfter the endorsement of Colas’ and Bouygues Telecom’s GHG emission reduction targets in 2021 and 2022  respectively  three other business segments of the Group (Bouygues Construction  Bouygues Immobilier and TF1) received SBTi endorsement for their decarbonisation targets in 2023.Equans has completed its global carbon footprint audit and will submit its targets to SBTi in 2024  with the aim of endorsement by the end of this year.The trend in the Group’s greenhouse gas emissions shows an initial downward trend in the carbon footprint of the business segments on a constant scope basis  with a decrease of 1.6 million tonnes of CO 2 equivalent year-on-year. This trend also shows the extension of scope 3b analysis  and the integration of Equans into the Group’s scope.A more detailed presentation of the CSR strategy  which includes the Climate strategy  will be given at the Annual General Meeting.GOVERNANCEAt its meeting of 26 February 2024  the Board of Directors approved the draft resolutions that will be submitted for approval by the Annual General Meeting on 25 April 2024 with the purpose of renewing the terms of office of two directors  Martin Bouygues (Chairman) and Pascaline de Dreuzy (independent director)  for three years  expiring at the end of the Ordinary General Meeting called to approve the financial statements for 2026.Assuming that these resolutions are approved by the Annual General Meeting on 25 April 2024:the Board of Directors would remain at a membership of 14  and include two new directors representing employees (to be appointed by the Group Council on 11 April 2024) and two directors representing employee shareholders;the proportion of women and the proportion of independent directors would both remain unchanged at 50% (directors representing employees and employee shareholders are not included in the calculation of these percentages).Further  following the expiry of the terms of office of the CEO and the two Deputy CEOs  the Board of Directors:confirmed the decision to separate the functions of Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer;renewed the term of office of Martin Bouygues as Chairman of the Board of Directors 17 ;; renewed for a three-year period the terms of office of Olivier Roussat as Chief Executive Officer  ofPascal Grangé as Deputy CEO (who retains his office as Chief Financial Officer) and of Edward Bouygues as Deputy CEO in charge of Telecoms development  CSR and Innovation.FINANCIAL CALENDAR25 April 2024: Annual General Meeting (3.30pm CET)3 May 2024: Dividend payment  subject to approval by the Annual General Meeting7 May 2024: First-quarter 2024 results (7.30am CET)26 July 2024: First-half 2024 results (7.30am CET)5 November 2024: Nine-month 2024 results (7.30am CET)The financial statements have been audited and the statutory auditors have issued a report certifying them without reserve.You can find the full financial statements and notes to the financial statements on www.bouygues.com/results.The results presentation for analysts will start at 11am (CET) on 27 February 2024.Details on how to connect are available on www.bouygues.com.The results presentation will be available before the webcast startson www.bouygues.com/results.ABOUT BOUYGUESBouygues is a diversified services group operating in over 80 countries with 201 500 employees all working to make life better every day.

I am very satisfied with how quickly and seamlessly Equans is integrating into the Bouygues group  and equally with the initial steps taken to roll out the strategic plan unveiled to the financial community in February 2023. The Bouygues group also made considerable progress in CSR in 2023. Each business segment has measurable  quantified targets relating to our key challenges. On the climate front  our decarbonisation targets are now documented and endorsed  while Equans is currently going through the endorsement process. The 10-eurocent increase in the dividend testifies to the Group’s ability to create value for its shareholders.”Full-year 2023 sales were €56 billion  up 26% versus 2022  driven mainly by Equans’ contribution. Sales growth was 3% compared with the 2022 proforma figure including Equans.

The ex-date and payment date have been set at 30 April and 3 May 2024  respectively.OUTLOOK FOR 2024The outlook below is based on information known to date.Outlook for the GroupIn 2024  Equans will continue to improve its results in line with its strategic Perform plan. Bouygues Immobilier will continue to face a challenging market environment  with low visibility on the timetable for recovery.In an uncertain economic and geopolitical environment  and after a year of strong growth  Bouygues is targeting sales and current operating profit from activities (COPA) for 2024 that are slightly up on 2023.Outlook for EquansIn 2024  Equans will continue to roll out its strategic plan. It will remain focused on improving performance in a supportive environment and will continue to prioritise margins over volume growth. The 2024 sales figure will be close to that of 2023  because it will factor in both the effects of growth in Equans’ markets and the scope effect related to the asset-based activity disposals at end-2023  and the selective approach to contracts strategy.As a reminder  Equans is aiming for:Sales: from 2025 onwards  an acceleration in organic sales growth to align with that of market peersMargin: In 2025  a current operating margin from activities (COPA margin) close to 4% In 2027  a current operating margin from activities (COPA margin) of 5%Cash: a cash conversion rate (COPA-to-cash flow8) before working capital requirements (WCR) of between 80% and 100%Outlook for Bouygues TelecomAs it continues to grow its customer base  particularly in the fixed segment  and maintains its investments to boost its mobile network  Bouygues Telecom’s guidance for 2024 is as follows:an increase in sales billed to customers;EBITDA after Leases of above €2 billion;gross capital expenditure at around €1.5 billion (excluding frequencies).Outlook for the TF1 groupIn line with TF1’s distribution policy disclosed in February 2023  the Board of Directors will propose to the General Meeting of Shareholders on 17 April 2024 the payment of a dividend of fifty-five cents per share  an increase of five eurocents or up 10% versus 2022.The TF1 group’s ambition is to establish itself as the go-to free-to-air destination for news and family entertainment in France.The TF1 group's outlook for 2024 is the following:keep growing in digital  building on the promising launch of TF1+;maintain a broadly stable current operating margin from activities  close to that of 2023;continue to generate solid cash flow  enabling the TF1 group to aim for a growing dividend policy over the next few years.DETAILED ANALYSIS BY SECTOR OF ACTIVITYCONSTRUCTION BUSINESSESAs a reminder  Bouygues Energies & Services has been consolidated within Equans since the start of 2023. For easier comparison  the 2022 data for the construction businesses presented below have been restated for Bouygues Energies & Services  as it contributed to Bouygues Construction’s figures.At end-December 2023  the backlog in the construction businesses (Bouygues Construction excluding Bouygues Energies & Services  Bouygues Immobilier and Colas) rose 4% year-on-year to €28.4 billion (up 7% at constant exchange rates and excluding principal disposals and acquisitions).Bouygues Construction’s order intake in 2023 was €10.6 billion  driven notably by the award of major contracts  which represented 50% of the full-year 2023 order intake. Examples include the Abidjan metro (first quarter  for around €770 million)  the Potomac River Tunnel in the US (fourth quarter  for around €480 million) and a metro line extension in Hong Kong (MTRC 1201  second quarter  for around €470 million). The normal course of business also remained steady. Bouygues Construction’s backlog (excluding Bouygues Energies & Services) stood at €15 billion at end-2023  up 6% year-on-year (up 9% at constant exchange rates and excluding principal disposals and acquisitions)  providing good visibility on future activity. This growth was driven by the Civil Works backlog (up 12% year-on-year) and the International Building backlog (up 5% year-on-year).Bouygues Immobilier is still contending with a challenging market environment. As such  residential property reservations were down 25% year-on-year. In France  block sales rose by 19%  representing 48% of reservations in 2023  versus 30% in 2022. Commercial property activity remains at a standstill as investor delay their decisions. In this context  Bouygues Immobilier is adapting its organisation and postponing the launch of a certain number of projects. Its backlog was 32% lower than at end-2022.Colas benefited from order intake of €13.7 billion. The backlog was €12.4 billion  up 6% year-on-year (up 9% at constant exchange rates and excluding principal disposals and acquisitions)  driven by International (up 6%) and France (up 7%) – especially Rail outside France  in connection with several major contracts which were awarded in the past year such as the extension of the NSCR line in Manila (worth around €660 million)  the Abidjan metro (around €330 million) and the Old Oak Common station in the United Kingdom (around €215 million). As a result  the Rail backlog was up 39% year-on-year. The Roads backlog was down 5% year-on-year (down 3% year-on-year like-for-like and excluding principal disposals and acquisitions).The construction businesses reported sales of €27.3 billion in 2023  up 2% year-on-year  driven by Bouygues Construction and Colas. Like-for-like and at constant exchange rates  sales increased 4%. Bouygues Construction’s sales rose 5%  lifted mainly by a strong performance from International Building (up 15%). Bouygues Immobilier’s sales declined 14%9 versus 2022  reflecting a challenging market environment (including the share of co-promotions  sales would have decreased 13%). Sales at Colas were up 3%  driven by Rail (up 6%) and to a lesser extent by Roads (up 3%) notably in EMEA  and rising 6% like-for-like and at constant exchange rates.The current operating profit from activities (COPA) in the construction businesses was €851 million at end-2023  up €70 million year-on-year  and the COPA margin in the construction businesses increased 0.2 points over the period to 3.1%.Over full-year 2023  Bouygues Construction’s COPA was €281 million  up slightly versus 2022. The margin from activities was 2.9%  very close to the level of 2022. Against a backdrop of a sharp decline in sales  Bouygues Immobilier’s COPA1 amounted to €28 million  a lower level than in 2022 (including the share of co-promotions  this figure would have been €56 million  at a similar level to that of 2022). At Colas  COPA was €542 million  an increase of €74 million versus 2022. This increase is notably supported by the United States  Canada and France. It includes the gain on a land sale in the United States during the third quarter. The margin from activities in 2023 was 3.4%  an improvement of 0.4 points year-on-year.GovernanceA change in governance has taken place at Bouygues Immobilier. On 19 February 2024  following the separation of the offices of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer:Emmanuel Desmaizières was appointed Chief Executive Officer of Bouygues Immobilier;Pascal Minault was appointed Chairman of Bouygues Immobilier.EQUANSEquans’ figures include Bouygues Energies & Services with effect from January 2023. The percentage changes shown below are a comparison with the proforma data for 2022  which include Equans and Bouygues Energies & Services before eliminations with Bouygues Construction. Equans’ proforma results for 2022  which were not audited  are provided for comparative purposes.In line with the announcements made at the Capital Markets Day in February 2023  Equans continued its selective approach to contracts  prioritising margins over volume growth in a supportive environment for its activities. Full-year order intake in 2023 amounted to €17.4 billion  reflecting significant order intake for data centres  construction of solar farms and gigafactories (electric vehicle batteries) in Europe and in the United States  as well as recurrent maintenance contracts for industrial sites and public buildings. The backlog  which includes Bouygues Energies & Services  was €24.8 billion at end-2023  down 4% versus end-December 2022  reflecting the selective approach to contracts strategy.Equans posted sales of €18.8 billion in 2023  reflecting positive market trends and factoring in the contribution of asset-based activities which were divested in late 2023. This can be compared with a proforma figure of €17.7 billion (unaudited) for 2022 and represents an increase of 6%. Current operating profit from activities (COPA) in 2023 was €545 million  an increase of €130 million versus the proforma 2022 figure  and reflects the continued roll-out of the Perform plan to all of Equans’ operating units. The margin from activities was therefore 2.9%  in the upper end of the range of between 2.5% and 3% announced at the Capital Markets Day in February 2023. Net surplus cash improved sharply in the period  driven by strong cash generation from operations  improvement in the change in WCR relating to operating activities and asset disposals.TF1TF1 group reported sales of €2.3 billion in 2023  representing an 8% decrease year-on-year (down 7% like-for-like and at constant exchange rates):Media sales fell 5% (down 2% like-for-like and at constant exchange rates  related to the disposal of Unify assets in 2022). Advertising revenue was down 4% year-on-year (-2% like-for-like)  but rose in second-half 2023 versus second-half 2022  reflecting a rebound in the advertising market driven by renewed adspend by certain advertisers and the Rugby World Cup  broadcast in September and October.Sales at Newen Studios declined by 23% year-on-year. The decline was due to an unfavourable comparison basis due to the delivery of flagship shows in 2022 (such as Liaison and Marie-Antoinette in third-quarter 2022)  the discontinuation of the Salto activity and the end of Plus Belle la Vie at France Télévisions. Newen also observed a slowdown in investment by international streaming platforms over the first nine months of the year.Current operating profit from activities (COPA) was €287 million  down €35 million year-on-year. The margin from activities was 12.5%  close to 2022  as expected. This was indicative of TF1’s tight control over programme costs  which amounted to €960 million (down €27 million year-on-year  or 3% lower)  in particular as a result of the decline in the advertising market during the first half of the year.Free cash flow before WCR stood at €178 million  confirming TF1’s ability to convert its results into cash. Net surplus cash stood at €505 million  an increase of €179 million year-on-year.BOUYGUES TELECOMBouygues Telecom continued expanding in both the mobile and fixed segments in 2023. At end-December 2023  mobile plan customers excluding MtoM totalled 15.5 million  thanks to the gain of 287 000 new customers since the start of the year  of which 71 000 in the fourth quarter. In fixed  FTTH customers were 3.6 million at end-December 2023  thanks to 574 000 new adds over the full year  of which 150 000 in the fourth quarter. The proportion of fixed customers subscribing to a FTTH plan continued to increase  reaching 73% versus 64% one year earlier. The total fixed customer base was 4.9 million  which was 232 000 more than at end-December 2022  of which an increase of 65 000 in the fourth quarter.Fibre performance is explained in particular by the sustained FTTH roll-out. Bouygues Telecom has reached its target of 35 million FTTH premises by end-2026  almost three years ahead of schedule.Within the framework of its fibre roll-out  Bouygues Telecom set up the SDAIF10 joint-venture (49% stake)  which is investing in fibre roll-out in Orange's part of the Medium Dense Area. In 2024  Bouygues Telecom will not exercise the call option  the first exercise period for which opens on 15 March 2024  which would enable it to lift its stake to 51% of this joint-venture.Sales billed to customers reflected this commercial momentum and reached €5.9 billion  up 5% versus 2022  lifted by the strength of the mobile and fixed customer bases and very robust ABPU11 (year-on-year  fixed ABPU rose €1.9 to €31.4 per customer per month  while mobile ABPU was stable at €19.7 per customer per month  as some customers migrated to cheaper plans  reflecting pressure on purchasing power).Sales from services rose 4% year-on-year  still held back by the decrease in sales from incoming traffic12. Other sales were slightly lower year-on-year  mainly due to a decrease in built-to-suit sales. In total Bouygues Telecom’s sales increased 3% versus 2022.EBITDA after Leases rose €196 million year-on-year to €1 969 million  driven by sales growth and continued tight control on costs. EBITDA after Leases margin was 32.9%  an increase of 2.1 points versus 2022.Current operating profit from activities (COPA) was €798 million  up €104 million year-on-year. Operating profit was €791 million and includes non-current income of €22 million.Gross capital expenditure excluding frequencies was €1 475 million at end-December 2023  in line with the target set for 2023.PUBLIC TENDER OFFER AND SQUEEZE-OUT FOR COLAS SHARESThe public tender offer followed by a squeeze out for the Colas shares not yet held by Bouygues  at a price of €175 per share  was followed by the delisting of Colas shares from the Euronext Paris regulated market on 22 December 2023.As of that date  Bouygues has held 100% of the share capital of Colas.FINANCIAL SITUATIONat €14.6 billion  the Group maintained a high level of liquidity  which comprised €4.9 billion in cash and equivalents  supplemented by €9.7 billion in undrawn medium- and long-term credit facilities;net debt at end-December 2023 was €6.3 billion  versus €7.5 billion at end-December 2022 13 . This change mainly reflected: the payment of dividends  the payment of €310 million 14 to Free Mobile  on 16 May 2023  in respect of which the Group is disputing the ruling and validity of its immediate execution 15   the disposal of asset-based activities at Equans  the squeeze-out of minority shareholders and subsequent delisting of Colas  the capital increase reserved for Bouygues employees  the change in the WCR relating to operating activities of +€1.1 billion. As previously announced  the change in the WCR relating to operating activities was -€0.6 billion in 2022. In the fourth quarter of 2023  the change in the WCR relating to operating activities was €3 billion  reflecting efforts made by the business segments;. This change mainly reflected: net gearing16 was 44% (versus 54% at end-2022).During 2023  Bouygues:renewed its medium- and long-term credit facilities as they expired  without financial covenants or rating clauses;redeemed a €700-million bond issue;repaid the syndicated loan arranged to finance the acquisition of Equans;issued several bonds for a total of €1 450 million.At end-December 2023  the average maturity of the Group’s bonds was 8.5 years  and the average coupon was 3.01% (average effective rate of 2.25%). The debt maturity schedule is well-spread over time  and the next bond redemption will be in October 2026.The Group’s long-term credit ratings by Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s of A3  stable outlook  and A-  negative outlook  respectively  were confirmed on 30 November 2023 and 11 December 2023.NON-FINANCIAL PERFORMANCEAfter the endorsement of Colas’ and Bouygues Telecom’s GHG emission reduction targets in 2021 and 2022  respectively  three other business segments of the Group (Bouygues Construction  Bouygues Immobilier and TF1) received SBTi endorsement for their decarbonisation targets in 2023.Equans has completed its global carbon footprint audit and will submit its targets to SBTi in 2024  with the aim of endorsement by the end of this year.The trend in the Group’s greenhouse gas emissions shows an initial downward trend in the carbon footprint of the business segments on a constant scope basis  with a decrease of 1.6 million tonnes of CO 2 equivalent year-on-year. This trend also shows the extension of scope 3b analysis  and the integration of Equans into the Group’s scope.A more detailed presentation of the CSR strategy  which includes the Climate strategy  will be given at the Annual General Meeting.GOVERNANCEAt its meeting of 26 February 2024  the Board of Directors approved the draft resolutions that will be submitted for approval by the Annual General Meeting on 25 April 2024 with the purpose of renewing the terms of office of two directors  Martin Bouygues (Chairman) and Pascaline de Dreuzy (independent director)  for three years  expiring at the end of the Ordinary General Meeting called to approve the financial statements for 2026.Assuming that these resolutions are approved by the Annual General Meeting on 25 April 2024:the Board of Directors would remain at a membership of 14  and include two new directors representing employees (to be appointed by the Group Council on 11 April 2024) and two directors representing employee shareholders;the proportion of women and the proportion of independent directors would both remain unchanged at 50% (directors representing employees and employee shareholders are not included in the calculation of these percentages).Further  following the expiry of the terms of office of the CEO and the two Deputy CEOs  the Board of Directors:confirmed the decision to separate the functions of Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer;renewed the term of office of Martin Bouygues as Chairman of the Board of Directors 17 ;; renewed for a three-year period the terms of office of Olivier Roussat as Chief Executive Officer  ofPascal Grangé as Deputy CEO (who retains his office as Chief Financial Officer) and of Edward Bouygues as Deputy CEO in charge of Telecoms development  CSR and Innovation.FINANCIAL CALENDAR25 April 2024: Annual General Meeting (3.30pm CET)3 May 2024: Dividend payment  subject to approval by the Annual General Meeting7 May 2024: First-quarter 2024 results (7.30am CET)26 July 2024: First-half 2024 results (7.30am CET)5 November 2024: Nine-month 2024 results (7.30am CET)The financial statements have been audited and the statutory auditors have issued a report certifying them without reserve.You can find the full financial statements and notes to the financial statements on www.bouygues.com/results.The results presentation for analysts will start at 11am (CET) on 27 February 2024.Details on how to connect are available on www.bouygues.com.The results presentation will be available before the webcast startson www.bouygues.com/results.ABOUT BOUYGUESBouygues is a diversified services group operating in over 80 countries with 201 500 employees all working to make life better every day.

The geographical distribution is as follows:Francophone In EURM United Kingdom and the rest of the world United States Europe CA 2023 35% 47% 18% CA 2022 33% 47% 20%The 2023 fiscal year was notably driven by significant activity with the National Football League and one of its biggest clubs  which won the Super Bowl for the second time  with prestigious new football clubs  and even diversification outside of the sports world but still linked to it  as part of the Paris Olympics. It is noteworthy that Samba Digital made a significant investment effort of USD1M in Artificial Intelligence for its Força ""creative services"" online offering  which is already bearing fruit since  as of today  the revenue already billed in 2024 amounts to USD321K  thus validating the forecast of USD2M included in the budgeted 2024 revenue of USD10M. It is important to mention that this offering was developed in partnership with Orange Business' Data Science department. Operating income stands at EUR1.51M  up 76% from 2022.

After accounting for a tax expense of EUR328K  net income stands at EUR1.18M  up 78% from 2022. The net margin remains solid  exceeding 21%.A solid financial structureThe company is fully self-financed without having to resort to bank debt.

As of 12/31/2023  the company's consolidated cash holdings amount to EUR906K (including USD292K on the US subsidiary's books)  and its client receivables stand at EUR1.3M.

Concurrently  the company will continue its expansion into new regions  particularly in the Middle East and specifically in Saudi Arabia  where it is already involved in projects related to the 2034 Football World Cup. Thanks to its business model favouring recurring subscription-type revenues and the high renewal rate of its client contracts  Samba Digital starts the year with a high level of backlog. The company thus is aiming for a 2024 revenue of EUR10M  representing an organic growth of nearly 70% for the upcoming fiscal year.
