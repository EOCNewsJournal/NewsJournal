Despite the complex pathophysiology  the resultant clinical profile is thought to manifest as a self-reinforcing negative feedback cycle characterized by decreased glomerular filtration  increased renal sodium avidity  and congestion  despite escalating diuretic doses.No current therapies have been shown to improve patient outcomes in this complex and poorly understood indication. Reducing congestion is a key element of therapy but loop diuretics exacerbate many of the core mechanisms thought to underly CRS. Through effective control of the volume status for an extended period of time and thereby avoiding the negative consequences of loop diuretics  DSR has the potential to break the negative feedback cycle of this clinical challenge.Extensive analysis of patients in the RED DESERT and SAHARA studies shows the benefit from DSR therapy on i) volume status  ii) normalized diuretic response and dramatically reduced loop diuretic dosing  iii) improvement in kidney function  iv) neurohormonal status and signalling  as well as v) cardiovascular parameters. In these patients there were no congestion-related re-hospitalizations  a one class improvement in their NYHA status and a reduction of 75% in their predicated one-year mortality (based on the Seattle Heart Failure model). Initial data from the non-randomized cohort in the US MOJAVE study support these findings and indicated that DSR is safe and well tolerated  restores diuretic response and improves cardio-renal health.Data from the RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies have been submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.About Sequana MedicalSequana Medical NV is a pioneer in treating fluid overload  a serious and frequent clinical complication in patients with liver disease  heart failure and cancer. This causes major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care  they become ineffective  untolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing ""diuretic-resistant"" patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  delivering major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients and reducing costs for healthcare systems.The Company's Premarket Approval (PMA) application for the alfapump was submitted to the US FDA in December 2023 and accepted for substantive review in January 2024  having reported positive primary and secondary endpoint data from the North American pivotal POSEIDON study in recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis. US market approval of the alfapump is anticipated in the second half of 2024.Results of the Company's RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure support DSR's mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE  a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study  have been successfully treated with DSR  confirming the strong clinical outcomes seen in the RED DESERT and SAHARA studies. The independent Data Safety Monitoring Board approved the start of the randomized MOJAVE cohort of up to a further 30 patients  which is planned after alfapump PMA approval.Sequana Medical is listed on Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent  Belgium. For further information  please visit www.sequanamedical.com.Important Regulatory DisclaimersThe alfapump® system is currently not approved in the United States or Canada. In the United States and Canada  the alfapump system is currently under clinical investigation (POSEIDON Trial) and is being studied in adult patients with refractory or recurrent ascites due to liver cirrhosis. DSR® therapy is still in development and it should be noted that any statements regarding safety and efficacy arise from ongoing pre-clinical and clinical investigations which have yet to be completed.

This comprehensive study  carried out by Ipsos  provides an updated perspective on air passenger profiles  their relationship with the airport environment and their perception of advertising within airports.A premium  younger and more affluent audienceThe Ipsos research unveils that the typical flyer profile tends to be younger (index 111 for aged 25-44) and more affluent (index 123 for high income) compared to the general population.Despite the development of videocoference applications  the ACI ASQ Global Traveller Survey shows that the volume of Business travellers has increased in 2022 and 2023 compared to 2019 (24% vs 22%) and the Ipsos research shows they maintain a notably higher frequency of travel compared to the average flyer with an average of almost 5 trips over the past 12 months versus 3.6 for the general flyer population. And global air travel intention remains robust.Airports hold a special allure for travellers  serving as integral components of their overall travel experience rather than mere stopoversThe predominant feelings  whether at departures or arrivals  are excitement and curiosity. Moreover  flyers overwhelmingly recognise and value the unique appeal of the airport environment  indicating its profound influence on their perceptions and experiences. A remarkable 71% express appreciation for the layout and ambiance of airports. Similarly  an equal percentage (71%) underscores the distinctive and exclusive nature of the airport experience  distinguishing it from the everyday routines of life. Additionally  a notable 68% agree that airports are essential components of their holiday or travel experiences.Shopping holds a pivotal role in the airport experience for travellersIndeed  a striking 85% of flyers have made purchases at the airport in the past 12 months  indicating a strong engagement with retail offerings. This figure excludes spend on food and beverages.Also  65% of flyers do not pre-plan their purchase at the airport  presenting an opportunity for influence and spontaneous consumption.Airport advertising is more powerful and influential than everThe majority of travellers perceive airport advertising in a positive light. Indeed  70% of flyers indicate that they enjoy looking at the exhibition stands  shops  advertising  and other things to see when they are at the airport.Top associations for brands being advertised at the airport are that they are “global”  “successful”  “innovative”  “trustworthy” & “prestigious”.Furthermore  flyers view airport advertising more favourably than online and social media ads across key metrics such as international status  creativity  superior quality  attention or superior brand image.Airport advertising influences consumer choices across the entire purchasing funnel  affecting awareness  consideration  and conversion77% of flyers in the past 12 months have taken at least one action during or after their trip after being exposed to an advertisement at the airport.Kelly Beaver MBE  Chief Executive of Ipsos UK and Ireland  said: “We are proud to have partnered with JCDecaux on this ground-breaking research project. This research underscores the significant impact airports have on passenger perceptions and behaviours  highlighting the importance of airport advertising in capturing the attention and influencing the actions of this highly engaged audience.”Jérôme Lepage  Marketing & Business Development Director – Transport Division of JCDecaux  said: “As the number one airport advertising company worldwide  present in more than 150 airports among them majors hubs like Los Angeles Intl Airport  London Heathrow  Paris Roissy-Charles de Gaulle  Dubai International  Shanghai Hongqiao or Singapore Changi  JCDecaux is thrilled to unveil the insights from our latest global research  “First Class Advertising – The Enduring Magic of Airports”. The Ipsos research findings confirm the potent opportunity for brands to connect with business  leisure and the new bleisure travellers in these influential spaces. Not only do flyers enjoy the airport experience and advertising  but they are also receptive to it and act upon it  making airport advertising more powerful and influential than ever.”MethodologyConducted by Ipsos on behalf of JCDecaux  the study involved a 15-minute online survey of 11 368 participants aged 18-65 in 14 global markets: Australia  Belgium  Brazil  Mainland China and China Hong-Kong SAR  France  Germany  India  Italy  Saudi Arabia  Singapore  United Arab Emirates  United Kingdom  and United States.

Net profit 1.18 .66 +78% +85% Net margin 21.2% 17.3% +3.9%The variation indicates growth in published data and  at constant exchange rates  the progression in dollars excluding currency variation.The final and audited accounts will be available by May 20  2024  at the latest.Increase in Activity Across All RegionsIn 2023  Samba Digital successfully deployed its offerings globally  perfectly meeting the challenges of digital sports marketing in all regions of the world. The geographical distribution remains roughly the same as in 2022  with slight growth in Francophone Europe.The geographical distribution is as follows:In €M Francophone Europe United Kingdom and the rest of the world United States CA 2023 35% 47% 18% CA 2022 33% 47% 20%The 2023 fiscal year was notably driven by significant activity with the National Football League and one of its biggest clubs  which won the Super Bowl for the second time  with prestigious new football clubs  and even diversification outside of the sports world but still linked to it  as part of the Paris Olympics.It is noteworthy that Samba Digital made a significant investment effort of $1M in Artificial Intelligence for its Força ""creative services"" online offering  which is already bearing fruit since  as of today  the revenue already billed in 2024 amounts to $321K  thus validating the forecast of $2M included in the budgeted 2024 revenue of $10M. It is important to mention that this offering was developed in partnership with Orange Business' Data Science department.Operating income stands at €1.51M  up 76% from 2022. Thanks to a 100% subcontracting model and an increase in activity allowing for better absorption of its fixed costs  Samba Digital's operational profitability significantly appreciated in 2023  reaching 27.1% of revenue  an increase of 4.7 points.After accounting for a tax expense of €328K  net income stands at €1.18M  up 78% from 2022. The net margin remains solid  exceeding 21%.A solid financial structureThe company is fully self-financed without having to resort to bank debt. However  given the numerous development projects and their impact on working capital needs  the Company obtained a credit line of €400K from Santander Bank in 2023  which has been utilized up to €273K as of December 31.As of 12/31/2023  the company’s consolidated cash holdings amount to €906K (including $292K on the US subsidiary's books)  and its client receivables stand at €1.3M.Equity has reached €25.18M as of 12/31/2023 after incorporating the 2023 net income.Outlook: A revenue target of €10M for 2024For 2024  Samba Digital will continue its commercial efforts at a sustained pace with particularly dynamic news in the world of sports (Olympic and Paralympic Games in France in the summer of 2024  European Football Championships  etc.). Concurrently  the company will continue its expansion into new regions  particularly in the Middle East and specifically in Saudi Arabia  where it is already involved in projects related to the 2034 Football World Cup.Thanks to its business model favouring recurring subscription-type revenues and the high renewal rate of its client contracts  Samba Digital starts the year with a high level of backlog. The company thus is aiming for a 2024 revenue of €10M  representing an organic growth of nearly 70% for the upcoming fiscal year.As previously announced  Samba Digital also confirms its intention to request a transfer to Euronext Growth® Lisbon in the first half of 2024 followed by a dual listing of its shares in Paris.1 based on even exchange of €/$ABOUT SAMBA DIGITALFounded in 2018 in the United States  Samba Digital supports clubs and players in the sports and eGaming industry in their internationalization strategy  by developing their digital audiences around the world.The company is active on four continents: America (USA and LATAM)  Europe  Africa and Asia.

The appointment has immediate effect  following the Board’s decision to end the mandate of Andreas Segerros.Gavin Spencer was most recently Executive Vice-President  Chief Business Officer & Head of Corporate Development at Nicox. He has spent more than 25 years in the life sciences industry and combines strong business acumen with a solid scientific background and broad strategic  financial  corporate development  commercial and operational management experience in biotechs and large pharma.“I am delighted to welcome Gavin Spencer to his new role as CEO of Nicox. Gavin brings exhaustive industry experience  particularly related to strategic partnership agreements and financing. He has a deep understanding of Nicox and how to deliver on the Company’s potential  having been involved in all aspects of our activities over many years. We have reported positive results on our lead asset NCX 470 in its first Phase 3 trial in glaucoma  and Gavin’s initial focus will be on enabling Nicox to generate the additional data necessary for a New Drug Application for NCX 470. Gavin’s financial experience will be vital in moving this process forward  and his finesse and judgement will be equally important in our strategic and partnering discussions ” said Jean-François Labbe  Chairman of the Board of Directors of Nicox.During his time with Nicox  since 2005  Gavin Spencer has had a key role in building and managing Nicox’s partnerships  including closing agreements with Pfizer  Bausch + Lomb  VISUfarma and Ocumension Therapeutics. He has been involved in equity raising and investor relations at Nicox for many years and has led the Company’s recent financing activities. He has previously worked at Novartis Consumer Health and Boots Healthcare International and holds a Ph.D. in chemistry from the University of Aberdeen.“It is an exciting time for Nicox as we move towards the Phase 3 data from the second pivotal glaucoma trial of NCX 470  Denali  which we are conducting with our long-term Chinese partner  Ocumension Therapeutics. Interest in this innovative compound has been further validated by our recently announced Japanese licensing agreement with Kowa. While our re-negotiated debt agreement  also announced today  provides us valuable additional cash runway  we are working to put financing in place to complete the Denali trial. With full data from this trial  we believe we will be in a position to partner this innovative treatment for glaucoma in other territories  including the United States. Added to our current licensing revenue from VYZULTA and ZERVIATE  existing and future NCX 470 partnerships would generate additional royalty revenue on sales which we forecast could exceed $300 million worldwide  within 8 years of the date of launches in the U.S. and China” said Gavin Spencer  CEO of Nicox.About NicoxNicox SA is an international ophthalmology company developing innovative solutions to help maintain vision and improve ocular health.

The Renewstable Barbados (RSB) project has also made significant progress  securing $41 million in financing from the World Bank and the Green Climate Fund (GCF). This financing is an important step in the financial structuring of the project and confirms the viability of the Renewstable® model for all future projects.For all these projects  HDF receives or will receive revenues under project management assistance contracts during the development phase  followed by revenues from the delivery of fuel cells  for a combined sum representing between 12% and 17% of the project's total investment.Stable revenuesConsolidated revenues for 2023 amounted to €3.9 million (compared to €3.5 million in 2022)  including €3.2 million in project management assistance  excluding re-invoicing  without margins  for services outsourced to external service providers. It mainly comprises development work on the RSB project in Barbados (€2.9 million  compared to €3.0 million in 2022) and the Newgen project in Trinidad and Tobago (€0.8 million  compared to zero in 2022).HDF is also a shareholder in Renewstable Barbados (RSB) Inc  in which the Rubis Group is the majority shareholder  and in Newgen  in which the historical founder Kenesjay Green Ltd (KGL) also remains a shareholder. These two entities have been accounted for using the equity method since 2022.For the 2023 financial year  the development services provided by HDF on projects in which the Group remains the majority shareholder  the impact of which is eliminated in the consolidated financial statements  amounted to €1.1 million (compared to €3.0 million in 2022). These projects will contribute to the Group's consolidated revenue once shares are sold to investors and control of the SPV is lost. At that date  the revenue previously eliminated in the consolidated financial statements will be recognised through gains or losses on disposal of the investments.Damien Havard  Chairman and CEO of Hydrogène de France  said: “In line with the strategic plan  2023 saw the deployment of technical teams at head office to support the sales teams in the various regions in which the Group operates. This expertise has enabled us to advance the development of our projects  enabling us to envisage launching the construction of several of them in the near future.At the same time  the launch of the industrial project will culminate in the move to the new site in 2024. In 2025  the first fuel cell will be manufactured at our Blanquefort plant - a watershed moment for HDF!”ABOUT HYDROGÈNE DE FRANCE (HDF Energy)HDF Energy is a leading global player in the hydrogen industry  dedicated to developing large-scale hydrogen infrastructure and advanced multi-megawatt fuel cell technology.These fuel cells generate electricity from hydrogen  driving the decarbonization efforts across the power generation  heavy maritime and rail mobility sectors.

The debt restructuring is intended to facilitate future financing and in parallel pursue strategic options which would allow the completion of the NCX 470 Phase 3 clinical trial  Denali.The debt restructuring and related signature of the amended debt agreements (the “Closing”) will come into effect upon: Nicox initiating the Board-approved streamlining of its operating costs to focus on the completion of the Denali trial; and calling an Extraordinary General Meeting (“EGM"") to enable future financing.The debt restructuring together with a reduction in operating costs allows for the interest-only period on the entire outstanding debt to be continued to 30 September 2024  extending the Company’s cash runway to November 2024. Subsequently such interest only period would be further extended proportionally with future increases in the cash runway  provided however that the Company raises at least €3 million in equity financing by 30 September 2024  which would extend the cash runway into Q1 2025.The Company’s core ophthalmology development and key corporate functions will focus on the ongoing clinical development of NCX 470 in the pivotal Denali trial  preparation of a New Drug Application (NDA) and discussions on partnering and other strategic opportunities.“The additional cash runway and the overall reduction in cash needs gives us the flexibility to advance our core asset and continue partnering and strategic discussions. Specifically  this provides an opportunity to deliver on the promise of NCX 470 in glaucoma  and thereby to preserve and create value. We trust that our shareholders will recognize this at the Extraordinary General Meeting.” said Jean-François Labbé  Chairman of the Board of Directors of Nicox. “We sincerely thank our departing employees for their dedication and service  and wish them every success in their future endeavors. We would also like to thank the three Board members who are leaving us at this time for their contributions to the Company.”Debt RestructuringCurrent DebtNicox has a total amount of €16.9 million2 debt outstanding from Kreos Capital VI (UK) Limited (together with its affiliates “Kreos”)  in the form of amortizing and non-amortizing bonds (the Amortizing Bond and the Non-Amortizing Bonds respectively) as of 28 February 2024. Further details of the debt are given in Section 23.2.1 of the consolidated annual accounts in the Company’s Annual Report.Payments up to 31 December 2025Under the current bond agreement  Nicox was due to begin repaying the Amortizing Bond to Kreos from 1 February 2024.Under the agreed terms of the amendment announced today  Nicox will make payments of interest only on the entire debt to Kreos until 30 September 2024  based on a cash runway until November 2024. Provided that Nicox raises at least €3 million in equity by 30 September 2024  the interest-only period will be extended each time the cash runway is increased  and no later than 31 December 2025.Nicox has the option to make capital repayments as part of paying down the Amortizing Bond. If Nicox decides not to make these payments  the interest rate on the entire debt would increase to 13.5% (from 9.25%) until such payments are made.Nicox will pay Kreos a 3% restructuring fee upon Closing.Payments from 1 January 2026The Non-amortizing Bonds are currently due to be repaid on 1 January 2026.Under the amended agreement  Nicox may  at its sole discretion  repay only part of these amounts  on 1 January 2026  and pay a fee on any unpaid amount  in which case Nicox will continue to pay interest on the remaining amount until 1 July 2026  which will be the final term of the debt.The settlement fee of 3% due on repayment of the entire debt due on 1 July 2026 shall be increased to 8% regardless of any pre-payments.Subject to a favorable vote at the EGM  the existing Non-amortizing Convertible Bond shall be cancelled and replaced with a new Convertible Bond at a revised conversion price (€0.4312  the 30-day VWAP prior to signature of the term sheet  subject to realignment with the next equity raise). If such a vote is not obtained  Nicox would pay back the loan in cash at the term together with a premium  which would be calculated as if the new pricing has been set for the convertible loan i.e. based on the share price increase at the time of repayment. The repayment may be made in cash or cash and shares  at Kreos’ discretion.Kreos still holds 100 000 warrants to acquire Nicox shares at €4.2344 from a previous debt restructuring in January 2021.Additional obligations upon NicoxUnder the proposed amendment  Nicox undertakes to:Immediately initiate implementation of the Board decision to reduce its operations in France and Italy to reduce operating costs and optimize the structure of the Company for the completion of the second phase 3 trial  Denali.Call an EGM to vote on future financing resolutions and the changes to the Convertible Bond noted above.Execution of the loan agreementThe agreement between Nicox and Kreos is subject to Closing  which is expected to take place by 31 March 2024.Nicox has proposed a business plan for the remaining term of the Bonds based on estimations of costs and expected revenue and are required to meet and discuss if there are any material changes to such budget. Any significant deviation from the plan would trigger a discussion with Kreos.Kreos will appoint two Observers (“censeurs”) to the Nicox Board of Directors  subject to EGM approval.Cash Runway and Cash NeedsThe debt restructuring and cost reductions extend the Company’s cash runway to November 2024  based on focusing exclusively on the development of NCX 470.The Company is pursuing business development discussions  including the sale or license of certain assets  and exploring multiple strategic options which could further extend the cash runway. The Company is evaluating all options for financing and will use the most appropriate at the time.If the Company is unable to continue extending the cash runway and hence the interest-only period of the Amortizing Bond  the Company would be required to start repaying the capital of the Amortizing Bond  and may not have sufficient financial resources to do so  which could require the Company to sell assets or take other necessary steps to safeguard the situation in case it is unable to make the debt repayments.Corporate Cost ReductionsThe Company is planning to reduce its operational costs to focus on the activities related to the Denali Phase 3 trial only. The implementation by the Company of their cost-reduction plan is a key feature of the debt restructuring agreement. As such  the Company and its Italian subsidiary will be reducing the number of employees. The development team in the U.S.  considered essential for the completion of the Denali trial  is not impacted by these changes.Corporate Governance ChangesIn the context of the cost reduction and downsizing  the following members of the Nicox Board of Directors have tendered their resignation  effective immediately: Adrienne Graves  Lauren Silvernail and Luzi von Bidder. These members will not be replaced on the Board of Directors.The Company will no longer be reporting Consolidated Financial Statements under IFRS and will limit its communication to statutory financial statements under French Gaap. Further details will be given in the full year 2023 accounts  currently expected to be published in April 2024.About NicoxNicox SA is an international ophthalmology company developing innovative solutions to help maintain vision and improve ocular health.

This unexpected improvement in the placebo group complicated the interpretation of the results based on this endpoint. However  other data from the trial suggested no deterioration in the condition of patients under treatment  which is a positive sign in the context of a degenerative disease such as CMT1A.In the meantime  the trial reaffirmed the high safety profile of the treatment already established in all previous studies. This safety profile is crucial for the treatment of a chronic disease such as CMT1A.On December 19  2023  Pharnext announced that pre-specified subgroup analyses of the PREMIER trial suggested an efficacy signal  including a better response in treated patients with a BMI<25  or in patients under 45 years of age.Analysis of the data also revealed that  while the study as a whole was indeed randomized into two arms (PXT3003 and placebo)  the distribution of the two treatments within each clinical investigation center was not balanced. As a result  in some centers  patients received only placebo  and in others only treatment. However  a post-hoc analysis showed that by removing data from centers with fewer than two patients per arm  i.e. 50 patients (13%)  there was a statistically significant difference between the treated and placebo groups on the CMTNS score.To advance these encouraging results  several additional studies enabled to refine our conclusions at this stage  with the analysis continuing and extending through Q1 2024.Considering all patients in the PREMIER trial  the CMTNS score  secondary efficacy endpoint  showed in both subgroups of patients with BMI<25 and age<45  a statistically significant improvement with PXT3003 treatment versus placebo.Considering only centers with at least two patients per arm  i.e. 87% of patients included in the PREMIER trial  a statistically significant improvement in CMTNS score was observed with PXT3003 versus placebo whatever the patient's weight.A simple comparison of adverse events collected during the PREMIER trial showed that patients in the PXT3003 group reported approximately 30% fewer CMT1A-related symptoms than patients in the placebo group (overall worsening  increased falls  weakness  pain  muscle stiffness  spasms  twitches). This observation suggests a potential positive impact of PXT3003 in alleviating typical CMT1A symptoms  potentially contributing to patients' quality of life beyond the detection capabilities of the ONLS scale.Now  as committed on January 17  2024  the Company stopped all operating expenses while completing the additional analyses for the PREMIER trial. It confirms having reduced its current consumption as announced and waiting for the results (by Summer 2024) of the Phase III trial currently being conducted in China by its partner Tasly  which acquired the licensing rights for PXT3003 in China in 2017  with 2 options:If the results of the study in China are negative  Pharnext will analyze these results and draw the necessary conclusions in conjunction with the Company's shareholders.If the results of the study in China are positive  showing a statistically significant benefit of PXT3003 on the primary endpoint  the ONLS score  Pharnext will continue its dialogue with the FDA and EMA to agree on a registration process for PXT3003 in CMT1A.Hugo Brugière  Manager of Pharnext  said: “I'm pleased to be gaining confidence as our analysis progresses  and look forward to the results of the parallel Phase III study to be completed soon in China.We are continuing our own analyses and will need to discuss with the FDA and EMA to agree on a registration pathway  as once again we remain hopeful of finally being able to bring a medical solution to CMT1A patients. If the results of the Phase III trial in China are positive  and even without FDA or EMA approval  the company will then be able to finance itself over the coming years solely through revenues from the Chinese license. More than ever  and thanks to many additional analyses  our teams are confident in the future"".DisclaimerPharnext arranged (I) financing in the form of convertible bonds financing (OCEAN-BSA) with Global Tech Opportunities 13 which  after receiving the shares resulting from the conversion or exercise of these instruments  will not remain shareholder of the Company  and (II) financing in OS bonds which were subsequently transferred to a trust  which is now responsible for their equitization.The shares resulting from the conversion or exercise of the above-mentioned securities will generally be sold on the market at very short notice  which may create strong downward pressure on the share price. In the specific case of the trust  the shares are sold on the market in accordance with the terms set out in the trust agreement.Shareholders may suffer a loss of their invested capital due to a significant fall in the Company's share price  as well as significant dilution due to the large number of securities issued to Global Tech Opportunities 13 and/or the trust.Investors are advised to exercise extreme caution before deciding to invest in the securities of a listed company that carries out such dilutive financing transactions  particularly when they are carried out in succession. The Company wishes to point out that this is not the first dilutive financing transaction it has undertaken.About PharnextPharnext is an advanced clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapies for neurodegenerative diseases currently without satisfactory therapeutic solutions.

Shareholders holding the Company’s shares through Euronext VPS may receive this cash dividend later on or about March 27  2024.Lars-Christian Svensen  Chief Executive Officer  commented:“The Company’s large  modern fleet has been predominantly exposed to the spot market  resulting in strong performance in the fourth quarter of 2023 and thus far in 2024. The market for large size dry bulk vessels continues to outperform the broader freight market due to increasing tonne-mile demand for various key commodities  including iron ore  coal  and bauxite. We have entered 2024 with strong demand in Asia and a broad-based global economic recovery underway  creating an overall healthy demand picture. Fleet growth  particularly in the Capesize segment  remains at historically low levels  and the global fleet is trading at historically high efficiency levels. The Company maintains a positive outlook  and with no unfunded capex or near-term debt maturities  we are well positioned to continue to return value to our shareholders through dividends. Golden Ocean has now paid a dividend for 11 consecutive quarters  demonstrating the Company’s potential as well as the resilience of its performance in weaker market conditions.”The Board of DirectorsGolden Ocean Group LimitedHamilton  BermudaFebruary 28  2024Questions should be directed to:Lars-Christian Svensen: Chief Executive Officer  Golden Ocean Management AS+47 22 01 73 40Peder Simonsen: Chief Financial Officer  Golden Ocean Management AS+47 22 01 73 40The full report is available in the link below.Forward-Looking StatementsMatters discussed in this earnings report may constitute forward-looking statements.

Reconciliation between the 2022 reported revenue and OM  and the 2023 revenue and OM at constant scope and foreign exchange rates is presented below  by Business Lines and Regional Business Units.In 2023  revenue was negatively impacted by €62 million as a consequence of the Group review of its accounting of some software resales following the IFRIC IC decision illustrated by the decision published by ESMA in October 2023 that enacted a restrictive position on the assessment of Principal vs. agent under IFRS 15 for the resale of third-party software licenses. This impact affected Eviden in the Americas RBU. It had no impact on the operating margin. Revenue for the 12 months period ended December 31  2022 was restated accordingly by €-71 million.FY 2022 revenue in € million FY 2022 published Restatement FY 2022 restated Internal transfers Scope effects Exchange rates effect on acquired / disposed perimeter Exchange rates effects FY 2022* Eviden 5315 -71 5244 -4 -220 2 -80 4943 Tech Foundations 6026 6026 4 -222 2 -106 5703 Total 11341 -71 11270 0 -442 4 -186 10646 FY 2022 Operating margin in € million FY 2022 published Restatement FY 2022 restated Internal transfers Scope effects Exchange rates effect on acquired / disposed perimeter Exchange rates effects FY 2022* Eviden 276 0 276 -2 -32 0 -10 233 Tech Foundations 79 79 3 -22 0 -5 56 Others & Global Structures 0 0 -2 1 0 0 Total 356 0 356 0 -53 1 -15 289* : At constant scope and foreign exchange ratesScope effects on revenue amounted to €-438 million.

They mostly came from the depreciation of the American dollar  the British pound  the Argentinian peso  and the Turkish lira.Internal transfers adjustments reflected split of Processia perimeter from Americas to Northern Europe & Asia-Pacific and to Southern Europe.***About AtosAtos is a global leader in digital transformation with 95 000 employees and annual revenue of c. €11 billion.

We expect to see the first benefits of this plan by 2024  with further acceleration from 2025 onwards.”€m except %Q42022 Q42023 Organicchange Reportedchange FY2022 FY2023 Organicchange Reported change Sales by region France 119.8 111.7 -6.7% -6.7% 413.6 413.2 -0.1% -0.1% EMEA ex.

The second semester was impacted by traffic slowdown  especially in December  due to the persistent inflation which affected consumer purchasing power. Sandro and the “Other brands” showed a positive annual performance. Digital sales also performed well.The network is growing with 12 net POS openings in 2023.In EMEA  sales reached €389m  an organic increase of +3% compared to 2022  driven by like-for-like network  despite a high basis of comparison. After a good performance in the first semester (+9%)  the second semester was impacted by inflation and demand slowdown. However  several European countries performed well (Germany  Spain and Middle East)  while the year was tougher in the UK and in Switzerland due to low tourism flow.The network remains nearly stable with one net POS opening in 2023. The openings offset the definitive closure of the POS of the former partner in Russia.In America  after two years in a row of outstanding performance  sales reached €173m  and recorded a slight organic decrease of 3% compared to 2022. The trend sequentially improved during the second semester with a positive organic growth in Q4. US sales remained resilient  and Canada returned to growth in Q4.The network increased by 17 net POS openings in 2023.In APAC  sales reached €255m  +13% organic vs 2022. Except for Korea and Taiwan  all the markets are progressing. Greater China sales signed a double-digit growth vs 2022. The rest of the region benefited from a good performance in Hong-Kong  Macau  Singapore  and Malaysia  and from the internalization of Australia & New-Zealand network.The network increased by 17 net POS openings in 2023.Unless stated otherwise  all figures used to analyze the performance are disclosed by taking into account the impact of the application of IFRS 16.KEY FIGURES (€m) 2022 2023 Changeas reported Sales 1 205.8 1 230.5 +2.1% Adjusted EBITDA 266.6 236.4 -11.3% Adjusted EBIT 110.5 79.5 -28.0% Net Income Group Share 51.3 11.2 -78.2% EPS2F2F3 (€) 0.68 0.15 -78.2% Diluted EPS3F3F4 (€) 0.65 0.14 -77.9% FCF 34.3 14.4 -57.9%2023 CONSOLIDATED RESULTSAdjusted EBITDA reached €236m in 2023 (adjusted EBITDA margin of 19% of sales)  compared with €267m in 2022.Management gross margin (73.8%  -0.7pp vs 2022) remained at a high level with an improvement in H2 (74.4% in H2 vs 73.1% in H1) due to a very strict full-price strategy. The average in-season discount rate remains nearly stable vs 2022  despite a challenging and very promotional environment in several markets.Total Opex (store costs4F4F5 and general and administrative expenses) have been impacted by inflation specially on rents and staff costs in stores and HQ. This increase has been controlled in particular in the second semester (vs 2022: +10% in H1 vs +3% in H2) resulting from savings plan implemented.Depreciation  amortization  and provisions remained nearly stable at -€157m in 2023  vs -€156m in 2022. Excluding IFRS 16  depreciation and amortization represented 3.8% of sales in 2023  nearly stable vs 2022 (4.1% in 2022).As a result  adjusted EBIT reached €79.5m in 2023 compared with €111m in 2022. The adjusted EBIT margin is 6.5% in 2023 (9.2% in 2022).Other non-current expenses reached -€26m  increasing vs 2022 (-€12m)  including impairment of stores and goodwill (with no impact on cash).Financial expenses are increasing at -€28m in 2023 (vs -€24m in 2022) due to the increase in interest rates.With an income tax expense at -€11m in 2023 (vs -€17m in 2022)  Net income - Group share remains positive at €11m (€51m in 2022).Excluding the non-cash impairment effect  the net income stands at €37m.2023 BALANCE SHEET AND NET FINANCIAL DEBTThe Group maintained a strict control over its inventories and investments during the year. Inventories went down from €292m year-end 2022 to €282m as of December 31st  2023.Capex increased as a percentage of sales  representing 4.5% of sales in 2023  compared with 3.7% in FY 2022.Net financial debt stands at €286m as of December 31st  2023  vs €293M on December 31st  2022  and €306m on June 30th  2023.The net debt/EBITDA ratio is at 2.55x. The slight gap with the contract level of 2.50x has been waived by the pool of banks.As a reminder  the maturity of the main lines of financing (including the revolving credit facility) has been renegotiated and extended to 2026 and 2027 depending on the lines  confirming SMCP's financial flexibility.CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOKAfter 2023 was impacted by a challenging macroeconomic environment  2024 should see a similar trend  especially in the first half of the year. Given the lack of visibility on the timing of the turnaround in consumer demand  the Group will not provide financial guidance for 2024. The management team is fully committed to accelerating its action plan to foster growth through new development opportunities and to protect profitability through significant savings. The action plan is articulated around four key priorities:1. Reignite growth and gain market share by working on brand desirability  maintaining brand relevance  and positioning  and maximizing the product offer. To this end  the Group will seize new digital opportunities and enhance its business model with new opportunities of development2. Mitigate risk across geographiesReview systematically the existing network by closing the less contributive points of sales (in particular 15% of China network) to improve retail productivityAccelerate opportunities with partners  such as Middle East and Latin AmericaChallenge operations in low contributive countries (mutualization  externalization and/or closing)3. Improve efficiency with more agility in the way we execute projects  as well as through a strict inventory management4. Continue to protect profits  cash and liquidity byShifting savings from a one-off to a recurrent approachprioritizing the most productive investmentsand adjusting the organization to optimize smaller brandsThe initial benefits are expected in 2024 with full effect from 2025 onwards. Management will provide an update on mid-term plan during next publication (end of April).OTHER INFORMATIONThe Board of Directors held a meeting today and approved the consolidated accounts for the year of 2023. The review procedures have been carried out by the statutory auditors and the related report is being issued.FINANCIAL CALENDARApril 25  2024 – 2024 Q1 Sales publicationA conference call with investors and analysts will be held today by CEO Isabelle Guichot and CFO Patricia Huyghues Despointes  from 6:00 p.m. (Paris time). Related slides will also be available on the website (www.smcp.com)  in the Finance section.FINANCIAL INDICATORS NOT DEFINED IN IFRSThe Group uses certain key financial and non-financial measures to analyze the performance of its business. The principal performance indicators used include the number of its points of sale  like-for-like sales growth  Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin  Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBIT margin.Number of points of saleThe number of the Group’s points of sale comprises total retail points of sale open at the relevant date  which includes (i) directly-operated stores  including free-standing stores  concessions in department stores  affiliate-operated stores  factory outlets and online stores  and (ii) partnered retail points of sale.Organic sales growthOrganic sales growth refers to the performance of the Group at constant currency and scope  i.e. excluding the acquisition of Fursac.Like-for-like sales growthLike-for-like sales growth corresponds to retail sales from directly operated points of sale on a like-for-like basis in a given period compared with the same period in the previous year  expressed as a percentage change between the two periods. Like-for-like points of sale for a given period include all of the Group’s points of sale that were open at the beginning of the previous period and exclude points of sale closed during the period  including points of sale closed for renovation for more than one month  as well as points of sale that changed their activity (for example  Sandro points of sale changing from Sandro Femme to Sandro Homme or to a mixed Sandro Femme and Sandro Homme store).Like-for-like sales growth percentage is presented at constant exchange rates (sales for year N and year N-1 in foreign currencies are converted at the average N-1 rate  as presented in the annexes to the Group's consolidated financial statements as of December 31 for the year N in question).Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA marginAdjusted EBITDA is defined by the Group as operating income before depreciation  amortization  provisions  and charges related to share-based long-term incentive plans (LTIP). Consequently  Adjusted EBITDA corresponds to EBITDA before charges related to LTIP.Adjusted EBITDA is not a standardized accounting measure that meets a single generally accepted definition. It must not be considered as a substitute for operating income  net income  cash flow from operating activities  or as a measure of liquidity.Adjusted EBITDA margin corresponds to adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales.Adjusted EBIT and adjusted EBIT marginAdjusted EBIT is defined by the Group as earning before interests  taxes  and charges related to share-based long-term incentive plans (LTIP). Consequently  Adjusted EBIT corresponds to EBIT before charges related to LTIP.Adjusted EBIT margin corresponds to Adjusted EBIT divided by net sales.Management Gross marginManagement gross margin corresponds to the sales after deducting rebates and cost of sales only. The accounting gross margin (as appearing in the accounts) corresponds to the sales after deducting the rebates  the cost of sales and the commissions paid to the department stores and affiliates.Retail MarginRetail margin corresponds to the management gross margin after taking into account the points of sale’s direct expenses such as rent  personnel costs  commissions paid to the department stores and other operating costs. The table below summarizes the reconciliation of the management gross margin and the retail margin with the accounting gross margin as included in the Group’s financial statements for the following periods:(€m) – excluding IFRS 16 2022 2023 Gross margin (as appearing in the accounts) 769.2 775.2 Readjustment of the commissions and other adjustments 128.3 135.2 Management Gross margin 897.5 910.4 Direct costs of point of sales -514.5 -554.5 Retail margin 383.0 355.9Net financial debtNet financial debt represents the net financial debt portion bearing interest.

In the last 14 months we obtained 14 approvals  across 6 patient populations and across 3 continents  fuelling our growth for a decade plus. As an example  superior patient experience and UCB's dedication have allowed to double the number of patients using BIMZELX ® in Europe over six months "" Jean-Christophe Tellier  CEO UCB commented. ""For future growth  we are studying innovative  potential medicines for 10 patient populations in 12 clinical development programs with expected news flow in 2024. What guides us is our belief that everyone deserves to live the best life that they can. We are therefore pleased with the growing access to our medicines across geographies  and we continue to decrease our greenhouse gas emissions in line with our commitment to reach net zero emissions.""FY 2023 revenue reached € 5.25 billion (-5%; -6% CER1). Net sales reached € 4.87 billion (-5%; -6% CER1)  based on the stable performance of CIMZIA® and the strong growth of BRIVIACT®  FINTEPLA® and BIMZELX®. As expected  this was more than offset by the contracting effects from the losses of exclusivity of two products.Underlying profitability (adjusted EBITDA2) reached € 1.35 billion (7%; -1% CER1)  despite lower revenue due to the losses of exclusivity  higher operating expenses – reflecting the investments into the future growth of UCB  namely into product launches - and compensated by higher operating income.Profit amounted to € 343 million (-18%; -34% CER1).

As expected  we're seeing the impacts from the losses of exclusivity for two products diminishing in the second half and thanks to the strong revenue performance of our growth assets  we returned to growth in the second half with almost +3%. Continued smart resource allocation and a strong contribution from EVENITY® enabled us to invest in the product launches. In 2024  we will accelerate our investments launching three products around the globe  including a direct to consumer (DTC) campaign in the U.S. for BIMZELX®  previously slated for 2023. We are on our way to deliver growth for a decade plus. Our financial guidance for 2024 foresees a growing top line and an almost stable adjusted EBITDA margin. Our commitment for 2025 for growing the top line to at least € 6 billion and an improved margin stands.""Regulatory and Clinical Pipeline UpdateUCB continuously innovates and strives to find new ways to deliver solutions to people living with severe immunological and neurological diseases  leading in 2023 to a clinical development pipeline with 12 clinical programs ongoing spanning 10 different medicines  set to help 10 different patient populations.

This application is for the treatment of partial onset seizures (POS) with or without secondary generalization in adult patients (≥16 years of age) with monotherapy and adjunctive therapy.In September 2023  UCB announced the approval of RYSTIGGO® (rozanolixizumab) and ZILBRYSQ® (zilucoplan) for the treatment of adult patients with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) in Japan  where RYSTIGGO® is indicated for patients inadequately responding to corticosteroids or non-corticosteroid immunosuppressants and ZILBRYSQ® is indicated for patients who inadequately respond to steroids or other immunosuppressants. In February 2023  PMDA in Japan accepted for review the filing of rozanolixizumab in a priority review.In October 2023  UCB announced U.S. FDA approval of ZILBRYSQ® (zilucoplan) for the treatment of adults with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) who are anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody-positive (anti-AChRAb+). ZILBRYSQ® is the first once-daily subcutaneous  targeted C5 complement inhibitor for gMG. It is the only once-daily gMG-targeted therapy for self-administration.In October 2023  the U.S. FDA approved BIMZELX® (bimekizumab-bkzx)  the first and only IL-17A and IL-17F inhibitor  for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy.In November 2023  UCB filed bimekizumab for the treatment of hidradenitis suppurativa (HS)  a chronic  painful  and debilitating skin condition  with PMDA in Japan.In December 2023  ZILBRYSQ® (zilucoplan) was approved in the European Union for the treatment of adults with gMG who are anti-AChRAb+. In September 2023  UCB received CHMP positive opinion for zilucoplan for the treatment of adults with gMG in Europe.In December 2023  BIMZELX® was approved in Japan for the treatment of adult patients with active psoriatic arthritis (PsA)  adult patients with active ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and adult patients with active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA). In January 2023  PMDA in Japan had accepted for review the filing for BIMZELX® in these indications.In early January 2024  RYSTIGGO® (rozanolixizumab) was approved in the European Union for the treatment of adults with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) or anti-muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) antibody positive. In November 2023  UCB received the CHMP positive opinion for rozanolixizumab for treatment of adults with generalized myasthenia gravis in Europe.In February 2024  UCB announced that the U.S. FDA accepted the supplemental biologics license applications (sBLA) seeking approval of BIMZELX® (bimekizumab-bkzx) for three new spondyloarthritides indications: psoriatic arthritis (PsA)  non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS). The fourth sBLA for hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) has also been submitted to FDA. UCB expects FDA action and potential approvals for all indications before the end of 2024.Pipeline UpdateIn November 2023  first patients were included in a phase 2a study with UCB0022. UCB0022 is designed to enhance the potency of endogenous dopamine 'when and where needed'. UCB0022 is an orally available  brain-penetrant  small molecule acting as a Dopamine-1 receptor positive allosteric modulator. UCB0022 could bring  as symptomatic treatment  significant positive impact on the quality of life of people who are suffering from Parkinson's symptoms despite an adequately dosed treatment without bothersome side effects that can result from Dopamine-receptor overstimulation. First results are expected in H1 in 2025.During H2 2023  UCB9741 and UCB1381 progressed successfully and moved into Phase 2a status with first headline results expected in H2 2024. Atopic Dermatitis (AtD) is a common inflammatory skin disorder with higher prevalence rates among children. Despite evolving standard of care  unmet needs for moderate to severe AtD patients persist. Multiple pathways are believed to be the driver of pathobiology in AtD  as such UCB is developing two anti-bodies targeting distinct pathways.All other clinical studies are continuing as planned  with headline results expected for 11 programs in 2024.Net sales break-down by key productsDue to rounding  some financial data may not add up in the tables.CIMZIA® (certolizumab pegol) reached more than 180 000 people living with inflammatory TNF-mediated diseases. CIMZIA® is showing a stronger growth than the anti-TNF market – based on differentiation. CIMZIA® is offering treatment for women of childbearing age across 6 indications and for rheumatoid arthritis patients with high rheum factor levels. In Europe as well as in international markets growth trend continues. Volume growth in the U.S. remains robust with 5% plus. Also in Japan  volume growth was positive but over-compensated by the regular mandatory price cut.€ million 2023 2022 Act CER1 U.S. 1 364 1 381 -1 % 2 % Europe 428 416 3 % 3 % Japan 39 51 -24 % -17 % International markets 257 237 8 % 16 % Total Cimzia® 2 087 2 085 0 % 3 %VIMPAT® (lacosamide) was accessed by over 500 000 people living with epilepsy and is experiencing generic competition since March 2022 in the U.S. and since September 2022 in Europe due to loss of exclusivity.

Net sales in Europe increased to € 60 million after € 25 million in 2022. EVENITY® is being launched successfully globally by Amgen  Astellas and UCB since 2019  with net sales outside Europe reported by the partners. EVENITY® showed strong growth annualizing worldwide sales of more than US$ 1 billion. The worldwide profit contribution from EVENITY® is recognized under 'Other operating income'.RYSTIGGO® (rozanolixizumab-noli)  a new treatment option for people living with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) was launched in the U.S. in July 2023.

This was driven by the continued growth of UCB's product portfolio – namely BRIVIACT®  NAYZILAM® and FINTEPLA® showed double digit growth. CIMZIA® is the largest drug in the portfolio  showing stable performance and an increase at constant rates. EVENITY® as well as newly launched BIMZELX® more than doubled net sales. This performance was over-compensated by the known effects of the loss of exclusivity for VIMPAT® in the U.S. and Europe and E KEPPRA® in Japan.Royalty income and fees were € 77 million (-9%; -7% CER1) and other revenue went up by 5% (6% CER1) to € 308 million due to continued partnership activities  milestones and other payments from R&D partners and include a one-time amount of € 70 million from a milestone.Adjusted Gross profit (Gross Profit before ""amortization of intangible assets linked to sales"") was € 4 033 million (-5%; -6% CER1) and well in-line with the net sales performance. The adjusted gross margin remained stable at 76.8% as in 2022.Gross profit after ""amortization of intangible assets linked to sales"" reached € 3 545 million – a gross margin of 67.5% after 69.7% in 2022 and reflecting the addition of FINTEPLA® amortization. This amortization has been revised in late 2023 following a settlement in a patent dispute in the U.S. UCB is now considering Q4 2033 as the loss of exclusivity in the U.S.Operating expenses declined to € 2 888 million (-9%; -7% CER1) reflecting higher marketing and selling expenses  lower research and development expenses  slightly higher general and administration expenses and an ""other operating income"" which more than doubled.

The adjusted EBITDA ratio for 2023 (in % of revenue) reached 25.7%  after 22.8% in 2022.Total impairment  restructuring and other expenses decreased to € 53 million  after € 90 million in 2022. In 2022  this was mainly driven by fees and restructuring expenses related to the acquisition of Zogenix in March 2022.Net financial expenses went up to € 163 million from € 74 million  based on higher interest rates as well as higher interest cost due to higher net debt in connection with the acquisition of Zogenix in March 2022. Also  positive currency income in 2022 did not reoccur in 2023.Income tax expenses were € 98 million compared to € 91 million in 2022. The average effective tax rate was 22% compared to 18% in 2022  reflecting the lower earnings and the earnings mix.Profit amounted to € 343 million (-18%; -34% CER1).Core earnings per share  adjusted for the after-tax impact of to be adjusted items  the financial one-offs  the after-tax contribution from discontinued operations and the net amortization of intangibles linked to sales  reached € 4.20 after € 4.37 in 2022  based on stable 190 million weighted average shares outstanding.Dividend - The Board of Directors of UCB proposes a dividend of €1.36 per share (gross)  +2%.Financial Guidance 2024 - The year 2024 will be marked by intense ongoing global launches of the UCB growth drivers  BIMZELX®  RYSTIGGO®  ZILBRYSQ® and FINTEPLA® as well as EVENITY®.For 2024  UCB is aiming for an increase of revenues to the range of € 5.5 - € 5.7 billion taking into account the launches and the continued solid contributions from the existing product portfolio.UCB will accelerate investments in launches around the globe to offer potential new solutions for people living with severe diseases and remains committed to invest into research and development advancing its late-stage and early development pipeline. At the same time  UCB will continue to be cost disciplined and  as in 2023  to actively manage the tail of its portfolio. Underlying profitability  adjusted EBITDA  is expected in the range of 23.0% - 24.5% of revenue. Core earnings per share are therefore expected in the range of € 3.70 - 4.40 per share – based on an average of 190 million shares outstanding.The figures for the financial guidance 2024 as mentioned above are calculated on the same basis as the actual figures for 2023.Guidance for 2025: UCB confirms its growth ambition for 2025 based on the strong product portfolio and the strong growth drivers. Revenue in 2025 is expected to reach at least € 6 billion and the underlying profitability (adjusted EBITDA) at the low end of the range of low to mid-thirties in percent of revenue.Find the financial reports on UCB website: http://www.ucb.com/investors/Download-centerToday  UCB will host a conference call/video webcast at 08.00 (EST) / 13.00 (GMT) / 14.00 (CET)Register here: https://www.ucb.com/investorsFor further information  contact UCB:Investor RelationsGlobal Communications Antje WitteT +32.2.559.9414Antje.witte@ucb.com Julien BayetT: +32 2 559 9580Julien.bayet@ucb.com Laurent Schots  Media RelationsT+32.2.559.9264Laurent.schots@ucb.comCheck out our IR App on the App Store and Google PlayAbout UCBUCB  Brussels  Belgium (www.ucb.com) is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of innovative medicines and solutions to transform the lives of people living with severe diseases of the immune system or of the central nervous system.

By their nature  such forward-looking statements are not guaranteeing future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties  and assumptions which might cause the actual results  financial condition  performance or achievements of UCB  or industry results  to be materially different from any future results  performance  or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this press release.Important factors that could result in such differences include but are not limited to: global spread and impacts of wars and pandemics  changes in general economic  business and competitive conditions  the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing  costs associated with research and development  changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB  effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations  safety  quality  data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches  or disruptions of our information technology systems  product liability claims  challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates  competition from other products including biosimilars  changes in laws or regulations  exchange rate fluctuations  changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws  and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline  or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far  the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models  cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB's efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also  UCB or others could discover safety  side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB's products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover  sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment  including pricing pressure  political and public scrutiny  customer and prescriber patterns or practices  and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes.

The second semester was impacted by traffic slowdown  especially in December  due to the persistent inflation which affected consumer purchasing power. Sandro and the “Other brands” showed a positive annual performance. Digital sales also performed well.The network is growing with 12 net POS openings in 2023.In EMEA  sales reached €389m  an organic increase of +3% compared to 2022  driven by like-for-like network  despite a high basis of comparison. After a good performance in the first semester (+9%)  the second semester was impacted by inflation and demand slowdown. However  several European countries performed well (Germany  Spain and Middle East)  while the year was tougher in the UK and in Switzerland due to low tourism flow.The network remains nearly stable with one net POS opening in 2023. The openings offset the definitive closure of the POS of the former partner in Russia.In America  after two years in a row of outstanding performance  sales reached €173m  and recorded a slight organic decrease of 3% compared to 2022. The trend sequentially improved during the second semester with a positive organic growth in Q4. US sales remained resilient  and Canada returned to growth in Q4.The network increased by 17 net POS openings in 2023.In APAC  sales reached €255m  +13% organic vs 2022. Except for Korea and Taiwan  all the markets are progressing. Greater China sales signed a double-digit growth vs 2022. The rest of the region benefited from a good performance in Hong-Kong  Macau  Singapore  and Malaysia  and from the internalization of Australia & New-Zealand network.The network increased by 17 net POS openings in 2023.Unless stated otherwise  all figures used to analyze the performance are disclosed by taking into account the impact of the application of IFRS 16.KEY FIGURES (€m) 2022 2023 Changeas reported Sales 1 205.8 1 230.5 +2.1% Adjusted EBITDA 266.6 236.4 -11.3% Adjusted EBIT 110.5 79.5 -28.0% Net Income Group Share 51.3 11.2 -78.2% EPS2F2F3 (€) 0.68 0.15 -78.2% Diluted EPS3F3F4 (€) 0.65 0.14 -77.9% FCF 34.3 14.4 -57.9%2023 CONSOLIDATED RESULTSAdjusted EBITDA reached €236m in 2023 (adjusted EBITDA margin of 19% of sales)  compared with €267m in 2022.Management gross margin (73.8%  -0.7pp vs 2022) remained at a high level with an improvement in H2 (74.4% in H2 vs 73.1% in H1) due to a very strict full-price strategy. The average in-season discount rate remains nearly stable vs 2022  despite a challenging and very promotional environment in several markets.Total Opex (store costs4F4F5 and general and administrative expenses) have been impacted by inflation specially on rents and staff costs in stores and HQ. This increase has been controlled in particular in the second semester (vs 2022: +10% in H1 vs +3% in H2) resulting from savings plan implemented.Depreciation  amortization  and provisions remained nearly stable at -€157m in 2023  vs -€156m in 2022. Excluding IFRS 16  depreciation and amortization represented 3.8% of sales in 2023  nearly stable vs 2022 (4.1% in 2022).As a result  adjusted EBIT reached €79.5m in 2023 compared with €111m in 2022. The adjusted EBIT margin is 6.5% in 2023 (9.2% in 2022).Other non-current expenses reached -€26m  increasing vs 2022 (-€12m)  including impairment of stores and goodwill (with no impact on cash).Financial expenses are increasing at -€28m in 2023 (vs -€24m in 2022) due to the increase in interest rates.With an income tax expense at -€11m in 2023 (vs -€17m in 2022)  Net income - Group share remains positive at €11m (€51m in 2022).Excluding the non-cash impairment effect  the net income stands at €37m.2023 BALANCE SHEET AND NET FINANCIAL DEBTThe Group maintained a strict control over its inventories and investments during the year. Inventories went down from €292m year-end 2022 to €282m as of December 31st  2023.Capex increased as a percentage of sales  representing 4.5% of sales in 2023  compared with 3.7% in FY 2022.Net financial debt stands at €286m as of December 31st  2023  vs €293M on December 31st  2022  and €306m on June 30th  2023.The net debt/EBITDA ratio is at 2.55x. The slight gap with the contract level of 2.50x has been waived by the pool of banks.As a reminder  the maturity of the main lines of financing (including the revolving credit facility) has been renegotiated and extended to 2026 and 2027 depending on the lines  confirming SMCP's financial flexibility.CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOKAfter 2023 was impacted by a challenging macroeconomic environment  2024 should see a similar trend  especially in the first half of the year. Given the lack of visibility on the timing of the turnaround in consumer demand  the Group will not provide financial guidance for 2024. The management team is fully committed to accelerating its action plan to foster growth through new development opportunities and to protect profitability through significant savings. The action plan is articulated around four key priorities:1. Reignite growth and gain market share by working on brand desirability  maintaining brand relevance  and positioning  and maximizing the product offer. To this end  the Group will seize new digital opportunities and enhance its business model with new opportunities of development2. Mitigate risk across geographiesReview systematically the existing network by closing the less contributive points of sales (in particular 15% of China network) to improve retail productivityAccelerate opportunities with partners  such as Middle East and Latin AmericaChallenge operations in low contributive countries (mutualization  externalization and/or closing)3. Improve efficiency with more agility in the way we execute projects  as well as through a strict inventory management4. Continue to protect profits  cash and liquidity byShifting savings from a one-off to a recurrent approachprioritizing the most productive investmentsand adjusting the organization to optimize smaller brandsThe initial benefits are expected in 2024 with full effect from 2025 onwards. Management will provide an update on mid-term plan during next publication (end of April).OTHER INFORMATIONThe Board of Directors held a meeting today and approved the consolidated accounts for the year of 2023.

Related slides will also be available on the website (www.smcp.com)  in the Finance section.FINANCIAL INDICATORS NOT DEFINED IN IFRSThe Group uses certain key financial and non-financial measures to analyze the performance of its business. The principal performance indicators used include the number of its points of sale  like-for-like sales growth  Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin  Adjusted EBIT and Adjusted EBIT margin.Number of points of saleThe number of the Group’s points of sale comprises total retail points of sale open at the relevant date  which includes (i) directly-operated stores  including free-standing stores  concessions in department stores  affiliate-operated stores  factory outlets and online stores  and (ii) partnered retail points of sale.Organic sales growthOrganic sales growth refers to the performance of the Group at constant currency and scope  i.e. excluding the acquisition of Fursac.Like-for-like sales growthLike-for-like sales growth corresponds to retail sales from directly operated points of sale on a like-for-like basis in a given period compared with the same period in the previous year  expressed as a percentage change between the two periods. Like-for-like points of sale for a given period include all of the Group’s points of sale that were open at the beginning of the previous period and exclude points of sale closed during the period  including points of sale closed for renovation for more than one month  as well as points of sale that changed their activity (for example  Sandro points of sale changing from Sandro Femme to Sandro Homme or to a mixed Sandro Femme and Sandro Homme store).Like-for-like sales growth percentage is presented at constant exchange rates (sales for year N and year N-1 in foreign currencies are converted at the average N-1 rate  as presented in the annexes to the Group's consolidated financial statements as of December 31 for the year N in question).Adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA marginAdjusted EBITDA is defined by the Group as operating income before depreciation  amortization  provisions  and charges related to share-based long-term incentive plans (LTIP). Consequently  Adjusted EBITDA corresponds to EBITDA before charges related to LTIP.Adjusted EBITDA is not a standardized accounting measure that meets a single generally accepted definition. It must not be considered as a substitute for operating income  net income  cash flow from operating activities  or as a measure of liquidity.Adjusted EBITDA margin corresponds to adjusted EBITDA divided by net sales.Adjusted EBIT and adjusted EBIT marginAdjusted EBIT is defined by the Group as earning before interests  taxes  and charges related to share-based long-term incentive plans (LTIP). Consequently  Adjusted EBIT corresponds to EBIT before charges related to LTIP.Adjusted EBIT margin corresponds to Adjusted EBIT divided by net sales.Management Gross marginManagement gross margin corresponds to the sales after deducting rebates and cost of sales only. The accounting gross margin (as appearing in the accounts) corresponds to the sales after deducting the rebates  the cost of sales and the commissions paid to the department stores and affiliates.Retail MarginRetail margin corresponds to the management gross margin after taking into account the points of sale’s direct expenses such as rent  personnel costs  commissions paid to the department stores and other operating costs. The table below summarizes the reconciliation of the management gross margin and the retail margin with the accounting gross margin as included in the Group’s financial statements for the following periods:(€m) – excluding IFRS 16 2022 2023 Gross margin (as appearing in the accounts) 769.2 775.2 Readjustment of the commissions and other adjustments 128.3 135.2 Management Gross margin 897.5 910.4 Direct costs of point of sales -514.5 -554.5 Retail margin 383.0 355.9Net financial debtNet financial debt represents the net financial debt portion bearing interest.

Consolidated net sales rose organically by +6.4%  driven in particular by the very good performances of Bureau Veritas and Crisis Prevention Institute. Our companies also pressed ahead with their targeted external growth strategies.We are deploying the new strategic directions announced in March 2023  with a strong portfolio rotation  with the acquisition of a majority stake in the Scalian Group  and the sale of Constantia Flexibles at a price above Net Asset Value.In October  we announced the ongoing acquisition of IK Partners  a major step in the deployment of the Wendel transforming strategy. It will be the foundation of the private asset management division we are building.Implementing this ambitious strategy allows to accelerate Wendel’s diversification  to boost recurring cash flow generation and to enhance our attractiveness as an investor and as a listed company.The combined growth of our Principal investments activity and our Asset management activity  coupled with disciplined cost management  give us confidence in our ability to offer our shareholders growing and recurring dividends  starting now with a dividend increase of +25% to a level representing 2.5% of NAV. 2023 was a year of transformation for Wendel  and I would like to extend my warmest thanks to the Wendel teams who are so skilfully supporting this project.”2023 net sales2023 consolidated net sales(in millions of euros) 2022 2023 Δ Organic Δ Bureau Veritas 5 650.6 5 867.8 +3.8% +8.5% Stahl(1) 914.9 913.5 -0.2% -8.3% CPI 114.2 128.0 +12.1% +15.6% ACAMS(2) 66.2 91.6 n.a. +12.0%(3) Scalian(4) n.a. 126.8 n.a. n.a.

Volumes were generally stable over the entire year with contrasting situations depending on activities and geographies.

While listed peers’ multiples remain the main calculation methodology  in the event a significant gap with the acquisition multiple is identified  a calibration coefficient can be applied. The calibration process is strongly recommended by IPEV and is widely used in the industry.This application of the updated methodology has impacted Wendel’s December 31  2023 NAV by €+2.3 per share  or approximately +1.4%).The full methodology is available on Wendel’s website.Renewal of term and new Supervisory Board member to be submitted to the 2024 Shareholders’ MeetingIt will be proposed to shareholders to renew for a further four-year term Thomas de Villeneuve as member of the Supervisory Board.Non-financial ratings: Wendel confirms its inclusion in the DJSI World and Europe and improves its CDP scoreDJSIFor the fourth year in a row  Wendel has been included in the Dow Jones Sustainability (DJSI) World and Europe indices  making it one of the top 10% of companies in terms of sustainability in the Diversified Financials category.

Revenue growth on a like-for-like basis of 9.4%.Group EBITDA decreased by 9.0% to €284.6m  mainly impacted by lower subsidies  increased gap between tariff increases and the inflation of our costs base  and staff shortage challenges.Group share of net loss after tax of € (17.3)m compared to the prior period net profit of €43.9m from lower operating result and increased cost of debt.Ramsay Santé has maintained its actions to participate in the support of the French and Nordic countries healthcare systems and to complement public hospital capacity to cope with demand pressures. Continued commitment to better care accessibility through further development of out-of-hospital services (primary care  imaging  specialised care consultations  home care) resulting in a 5.4% increase in patient admissions in our hospital facilities.France revenue has grown by 9.2% supported by a 5.1% increase in admissions volumes  higher tariffs applicable since 1 st March 2023 and additional medical purchases rechargeable revenue. This is despite one business day less this semester compared to the previous one.March 2023 and additional medical purchases rechargeable revenue. This is despite one business day less this semester compared to the previous one. Nordic countries revenue grew by +10.5% on a like-for-like basis  with a reported revenue increasing by only by +3.4% penalised by unfavourable foreign exchange rate variances versus the prior period. The growth was mainly realised in acute care facilities in Sweden and from the contribution of two new geriatrics care contracts in Stockholm.The group consolidated EBITDA decreased by 9.0% or €28.1m to €284.6m (prior period €312.7m) with a margin of 12.0% (prior period 14.2%). EBITDA margin was driven down by the adverse trend on inflation not fully covered by revenue price increases in all jurisdictions and by lower subsidies level  despite the effect from ongoing cost control and efficiency actions. The €51.6m decrease of Covid-related government subsidies and of the French revenue guarantee compared to the prior period put further strain on the viability of some French facilities as they transition to less secure post-Covid government financing regime.Total interest expense increased by €34.8m or 52.4% including higher funding costs for 10.5m€ and evolution of our P&L impact from our hedge mark to market valuation. Average interest rate for our financial debt under IFRS rules for the last semester is at 4.22%. It was 3.8% as of June 2023.Group share of net result after tax was a loss of €(17.3)m compared to the prior period net profit of €43.9m  impacted by lower operational margins and reflecting increased funding costs. The prior period results included a non-recurring €31.0m (€24.2m net of tax) capital gain for a property sale in the Oslo area.Ramsay Santé has continued to invest in initiatives enabling its “Yes We Care 2025” strategy in addition to recurring investment on maintenance  optimisation and facilities portfolio improvement  resulting in total capital expenditure for the period of €84.7m net of proceeds from disposals  slightly below the prior period.Net cash flow from operating activities of €149.2m versus €183.6m in the prior period primarily reflected the dip in EBITDA generation  working capital seasonality and French subsidies payment terms.Net financial debt as at 30 June 2023 amounted to €3 869.9m  including €2 172.8m of IFRS16 lease liabilities.Ramsay Santé  now a mission-driven company  publishes its first social and environmental performance indicators. They include an engagement rate of its teams across Europe of 71% and a -17% reduction in its greenhouse gases emissions  thanks in particular to a change in anaesthetic practices in its 900 operating theatres. The Mission committee report is expected for publication end of 2024.Pascal Roché  CEO of Ramsay Santé says:“Ramsay Santé is committed to improving health of everyone through constant innovation. Being a mission driven company  we intend to generate profit with purpose. We want to do well financially by doing good to society. This led the Group to pursue its strategy of developing access to healthcare everywhere and for everyone by accelerating its range of out-of-hospital services and better care accessibility (primary care  imaging  specialized care consultations  home care). Consequently  the Group revenue increased by 7.3%. This increase in sales was unfortunately offset by the significant gap between the continuing high inflation in our base costs and price increases  resulting in a 9% drop in EBITDA during the semester.”The Board of Directors that met on 28 February 2024 approved the consolidated financial statements for the six-month period ended 31 December 2023. The consolidated financial statements have been subject to a limited review by the statutory auditors.Summary of resultsP&L – in € millions From 1 July 2023 to 31 December 2023 From 1 July 2022 to 31 December 2022 Variation Revenue 2 370.1 2 209.5 +7.3% EBITDA 284.6 312.7 -9.0% As a % of revenue +12.0% +14.2% -2.2 pts Current Operating Result 78.2 113.1 -30.9% As a % of revenue +3.3% +5.1% -1.8 pts Operating Profit 85.9 134.7 -36.2% As a % of revenue +3.6% +6.1% -2.5 pts Net income  Group Share (17.3) 43.9 -139.4% Earnings per share (in €) (0.16) 0.40 -140.0%Net Financial Debt – in € millions 31 December 2023 30 June 2023 Non-current financial liabilities 1 876.6 1 893.8 Non-current lease liability 1 942.9 1 928.0 Current lease liability 229.9 213.5 Current financial liabilities 60.1 58.8 (Cash and cash equivalents) (188.6) (352.2) Other financial (assets) & liabilities (51.0) (71.9) Net financial debt 3 869.9 3 670.0Cash Flow Statement – in € millions From 1 July 2023 to 31 December 2023 From 1 July 2022 to 31 December 2022 EBITDA 284.6 312.7 Change in working capital requirements (114.5) (83.5) Net cash flow from operating activities 149.2 183.6 Net cash flow from/(used in) investing activities (94.9) (96.9) Net cash flow from/(used in) financing activities (224.5) 10.8 Change in net cash position (170.2) 97.5 Closing cash and cash equivalents 188.6 220.9Breakdown of revenue by operating segmentIn € million From 1 July 2023 to 31 December 2023 From 1 July 2022 to 31 December 2022 Variation Île-de-France 573.7 517.9 +10.8% Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes 321.5 295.2 +8.9% Hauts de France 208.9 190.9 +9.4% Occitanie 142.2 134.8 +5.5% Other regions 377.9 349.1 +8.2% Nordic countries 745.9 721.6 +3.4% Reported Revenue 2 370.1 2 209.5 +7.3%Note : The table above details the contributions of the various operating segments to the Group's consolidated revenue.Changes in reported turnover from the half-year ended 31 December 2022 to the half-year ended31 December 2023.31 December 20226 months Changes in FX rates Acquisitions and disposals Organic growth 31 December 20236 months Variation In € millions 2 209.5 (57.6) 9.8 208.4 2 370.1 160.6 -2.6% 0.4% 9.4% 7.3%Significant events of the half-year:FranceRamsay Santé's hospitals in France continued to operate under the French government's revenue guarantee arrangements  which supported the business for the use of its facilities and services during the Covid pandemic and continued to help offsetting its negative effects on activity after that crisis period.The structure of the arrangements up until 31 December 2022 were similar to previous periods  however from the calendar year 2022 mental health services are excluded as they are now reimbursed under a bundled payment structure. The French Government prolonged its support to the industry through a modified revenue guarantee scheme for the calendar year up to 31 December 2023. This new guarantee amounts to 70% of the 2022 guarantee (tariff adjusted) plus 30% of the period billings.The amount of the revenue guarantee recognised by the Group for the half year ending 31 December 2023 amounts to €38.9 million (€62.2 million for the previous period) and was reported as “Other operating income”.Furthermore  significant grants recognised in the prior period as “Other operating income” have been either discontinued  such as compensation grants for additional costs related to COVID (prior period €20m) or transferred into an increase in tariffs since March 2023  such as specific grants funding inflation and mandated salary increases (prior period €45m).The group continued its expansion in its core strategic development areas:The first day mental health facility opened in Orleans in January 2024  to be followed shortly by a second one in the Ile de France region.A further 6 new imaging equipment have been installed and started their activity during the semester.Nordic countriesPatient demand continued to underpin the growth of the nordic countries facilities  with higher activity volumes and cost inflation remediation measures supporting the revenue and operating profit of the acute care facilities in Sweden. Capio has started operating two new geriatrics care contracts in Stockholm on 1st May 2023 representing an annual turnover of approximately €50m  and St Göran has opened its new maternity ward in Stockholm on 1st April 2023  supporting further organic growth in this half-year. Denmark revenue has been negatively impacted by new public contract tariffs effective since June 2023 and disappointing volumes. Norway is focusing on cost control actions and have been able to apply inflation increases in their revenue rates.Scope of consolidationRamsay Santé completed 2 small acquisitions in Denmark in connection with the activity of its existing subsidiary WeCare. Moreover  Ramsay Santé has increased its shareholding to 70% in WeCare by buying back minority partners. WeCare was already fully consolidated.Comments on the half-year accountsActivity and revenue:Activity and revenue in France and the Nordic countries have grown across the board reflecting sustained patient demand and the capacity of the group’s facilities to provide more care services despite staffing challenges from competition for nursing staff in Europe. Ramsay Santé Group reported a consolidated revenue of €2 370.1m for the half-year ended 31 December 2023  up 7.3% on a reported basis. Adjusted for changes in the consolidation scope and at constant currency exchange rates  revenue for the half year ended 31 December 2023 was up with a solid 9.4% organic sales growth.France revenue has grown by 9.2%  reflecting in part the March 2023 tariff increase  supported by an increase in volumes and in revenue medical purchases rechargeable revenue  and despite 1 less business day this semester compared to last year’s and the continuing shift towards a greater ambulatory care mix.France total admissions in our hospitals rose by 5.1%  extending and confirming the contribution of the group’s facilities to address the post-Covid backlog of elective hospital care:+4.7% in MSO (medicine  surgery and obstetrics)+12.3% in FCR (follow-up care and rehabilitation)-1.2% in mental healthOur French facilities managed approximately 350 000 emergency presentations this semester  confirming their important role in delivering on public service missions.Nordic countries reported revenue grew by +3.4% and was penalised by foreign exchange fluctuation by €57.6m by unfavourable foreign exchange rate. Organic revenue growth in the Nordic countries for the half year ending 31 December 2023 was +10.5% on a like-for-like basis from continued positive revenue growth acute care facilities in Sweden  together with the contribution of new contracts. Patients listed in our proximity care centres increased by 1% on the prior period.Results:EBITDA reached €284.6m for the half year ending 31 December 2023  down €28.1m or 9.0% on the prior period on a reported basis.The Group's EBITDA as at 31 December 2023 includes €38.9 million (€62.2 million for the previous period) related to the revenue guarantee described in the paragraph “Significant events of the half-year”. With Covid abating to a mainstream endemic status in 2023  no Covid costs compensations grants were received in the period (€28.4m prior period).EBITDA and margins were also driven down by inflationary pressures sustained from the impact of the effort made on the compensations and benefits made to our medical staff as well as overall operating expenditure price increases  in particular on energy and outsourced services. Ramsay Santé received funding through French tariff increases and Nordics agreements indexation with various public payors which only partially covered procurement and wages inflation.Cost control measures were sustained to adapt activities to the current inflation environment and resources allocation are also revisited as a consequence.Underlying current operating profit amounted to €85.9m for the half year ended 31 December 2023 (or 3.6% of revenue)  down 36.2% on the previous period.Other non-current income and expenses represent a net income of €7.7m for the half year ending 31 December 2023 (prior period €21.6m)  consisting mainly of a €15.1m profit on the remeasurement of options to buy back minority interests in the Nordic countries  in particular reflecting updated agreements further to the increase in shareholding in WeCare in Denmark.The cost of net financial debt amounted to €87.3m for the half year ending 31 December 2023  compared with €68.7m in the previous period  driven by higher funding costs. The impact of financial instruments recorded in P&L was a €11.9m expense (€10.8m income in the prior period)  contributing a further €22.7m increase in the net interest expense on the prior period. In accordance with IFRS 16  the Group recorded a financial interest expense of €39.9m related to lease debt (€37.0m the previous period).The group share of net income after tax for the half year ended 31 December 2023 was a loss of €(17.3)m compared to the prior period net profit of €43.9mImpact from IFRS16 Lease :Reported EBITDA of €284.6m in accordance with IFRS16 excludes contracted lease expenses for €125.8m which are instead recorded as amortisation of the right-of-use asset and interest on the lease debt as outlined in the table below. The increase in the lease accounting impact on the prior period primarily came from the effect of price indexation mechanism.EUR millions31 December 2023 31 December 2022 Δ IFRS16 Impact Pre-IFRS16 IFRS16 Impact Pre-IFRS16 Impact EBITDA 284.6 125.8 158.8 312.7 117.1 195.6 8.7 Depreciation & amortisation (206.4) (101.1) (105.3) (199.6) (94.6) (105.0) (6.5) EBIT before non-current items 78.2 24.7 53.5 113.1 22.5 90.6 2.2 Net interest expense (101.4) (37.7) (63.7) (66.5 (35.7 (30.8) (2.0) Net profit after tax (13.4) (9.3) (4.1) 47.0 (9.8) 56.8 0.5Cash-flow and financing :Reported net financial debt on 31 December 2023 was €3 869.9m compared with €3 670.0m on 30 June 2023. IAS 17 Net debt includes €1 876.6m in non-current borrowings and €60.1m in current borrowings  offset by €188.6m in cash and cash equivalents.The application of IFRS 16 to leases contributed €2 172.8m to net financial debt as of 31 December 2023  of which €1 942.9m was non-current lease debt and €229.9m was current lease debt.Net cash decreased by €163.6m over the half-year  which is seasonally generates lower liquidity from operations than the January to June period. This includes net borrowings repayments of €21.0m. The cash flow from operating activities was subdued from an unfavourable working capital variation encompassing the absence of collection of accrued revenue guarantee income  and higher interest paid.Total capital expenditure for the period of €84.7m was slightly below last year’s €91.0m and included maintenance and optimisation  as well as improvement on our portfolio of clinics. Significant effort is sustained to roll out our strategy to increase Ramsay Santé’s imaging assets portfolio  to invest on digital tools  and to acquire new equipment.About Ramsay SantéRamsay Santé is the leader in private hospitalisation and primary care in Europe.

Revenue growth on a like-for-like basis of 9.4%.Group EBITDA decreased by 9.0% to €284.6m  mainly impacted by lower subsidies  increased gap between tariff increases and the inflation of our costs base  and staff shortage challenges.Group share of net loss after tax of € (17.3)m compared to the prior period net profit of €43.9m from lower operating result and increased cost of debt.Ramsay Santé has maintained its actions to participate in the support of the French and Nordic countries healthcare systems and to complement public hospital capacity to cope with demand pressures. Continued commitment to better care accessibility through further development of out-of-hospital services (primary care  imaging  specialised care consultations  home care) resulting in a 5.4% increase in patient admissions in our hospital facilities.France revenue has grown by 9.2% supported by a 5.1% increase in admissions volumes  higher tariffs applicable since 1 st March 2023 and additional medical purchases rechargeable revenue. This is despite one business day less this semester compared to the previous one.March 2023 and additional medical purchases rechargeable revenue. This is despite one business day less this semester compared to the previous one. Nordic countries revenue grew by +10.5% on a like-for-like basis  with a reported revenue increasing by only by +3.4% penalised by unfavourable foreign exchange rate variances versus the prior period. The growth was mainly realised in acute care facilities in Sweden and from the contribution of two new geriatrics care contracts in Stockholm.The group consolidated EBITDA decreased by 9.0% or €28.1m to €284.6m (prior period €312.7m) with a margin of 12.0% (prior period 14.2%). EBITDA margin was driven down by the adverse trend on inflation not fully covered by revenue price increases in all jurisdictions and by lower subsidies level  despite the effect from ongoing cost control and efficiency actions. The €51.6m decrease of Covid-related government subsidies and of the French revenue guarantee compared to the prior period put further strain on the viability of some French facilities as they transition to less secure post-Covid government financing regime.Total interest expense increased by €34.8m or 52.4% including higher funding costs for 10.5m€ and evolution of our P&L impact from our hedge mark to market valuation. Average interest rate for our financial debt under IFRS rules for the last semester is at 4.22%. It was 3.8% as of June 2023.Group share of net result after tax was a loss of €(17.3)m compared to the prior period net profit of €43.9m  impacted by lower operational margins and reflecting increased funding costs. The prior period results included a non-recurring €31.0m (€24.2m net of tax) capital gain for a property sale in the Oslo area.Ramsay Santé has continued to invest in initiatives enabling its “Yes We Care 2025” strategy in addition to recurring investment on maintenance  optimisation and facilities portfolio improvement  resulting in total capital expenditure for the period of €84.7m net of proceeds from disposals  slightly below the prior period.Net cash flow from operating activities of €149.2m versus €183.6m in the prior period primarily reflected the dip in EBITDA generation  working capital seasonality and French subsidies payment terms.Net financial debt as at 30 June 2023 amounted to €3 869.9m  including €2 172.8m of IFRS16 lease liabilities.Ramsay Santé  now a mission-driven company  publishes its first social and environmental performance indicators. They include an engagement rate of its teams across Europe of 71% and a -17% reduction in its greenhouse gases emissions  thanks in particular to a change in anaesthetic practices in its 900 operating theatres. The Mission committee report is expected for publication end of 2024.Pascal Roché  CEO of Ramsay Santé says:“Ramsay Santé is committed to improving health of everyone through constant innovation. Being a mission driven company  we intend to generate profit with purpose. We want to do well financially by doing good to society. This led the Group to pursue its strategy of developing access to healthcare everywhere and for everyone by accelerating its range of out-of-hospital services and better care accessibility (primary care  imaging  specialized care consultations  home care). Consequently  the Group revenue increased by 7.3%. This increase in sales was unfortunately offset by the significant gap between the continuing high inflation in our base costs and price increases  resulting in a 9% drop in EBITDA during the semester.”The Board of Directors that met on 28 February 2024 approved the consolidated financial statements for the six-month period ended 31 December 2023. The consolidated financial statements have been subject to a limited review by the statutory auditors.Summary of resultsP&L – in € millions From 1 July 2023 to 31 December 2023 From 1 July 2022 to 31 December 2022 Variation Revenue 2 370.1 2 209.5 +7.3% EBITDA 284.6 312.7 -9.0% As a % of revenue +12.0% +14.2% -2.2 pts Current Operating Result 78.2 113.1 -30.9% As a % of revenue +3.3% +5.1% -1.8 pts Operating Profit 85.9 134.7 -36.2% As a % of revenue +3.6% +6.1% -2.5 pts Net income  Group Share (17.3) 43.9 -139.4% Earnings per share (in €) (0.16) 0.40 -140.0%Net Financial Debt – in € millions 31 December 2023 30 June 2023 Non-current financial liabilities 1 876.6 1 893.8 Non-current lease liability 1 942.9 1 928.0 Current lease liability 229.9 213.5 Current financial liabilities 60.1 58.8 (Cash and cash equivalents) (188.6) (352.2) Other financial (assets) & liabilities (51.0) (71.9) Net financial debt 3 869.9 3 670.0Cash Flow Statement – in € millions From 1 July 2023 to 31 December 2023 From 1 July 2022 to 31 December 2022 EBITDA 284.6 312.7 Change in working capital requirements (114.5) (83.5) Net cash flow from operating activities 149.2 183.6 Net cash flow from/(used in) investing activities (94.9) (96.9) Net cash flow from/(used in) financing activities (224.5) 10.8 Change in net cash position (170.2) 97.5 Closing cash and cash equivalents 188.6 220.9Breakdown of revenue by operating segmentIn € million From 1 July 2023 to 31 December 2023 From 1 July 2022 to 31 December 2022 Variation Île-de-France 573.7 517.9 +10.8% Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes 321.5 295.2 +8.9% Hauts de France 208.9 190.9 +9.4% Occitanie 142.2 134.8 +5.5% Other regions 377.9 349.1 +8.2% Nordic countries 745.9 721.6 +3.4% Reported Revenue 2 370.1 2 209.5 +7.3%Note : The table above details the contributions of the various operating segments to the Group's consolidated revenue.Changes in reported turnover from the half-year ended 31 December 2022 to the half-year ended31 December 2023.31 December 20226 months Changes in FX rates Acquisitions and disposals Organic growth 31 December 20236 months Variation In € millions 2 209.5 (57.6) 9.8 208.4 2 370.1 160.6 -2.6% 0.4% 9.4% 7.3%Significant events of the half-year:FranceRamsay Santé's hospitals in France continued to operate under the French government's revenue guarantee arrangements  which supported the business for the use of its facilities and services during the Covid pandemic and continued to help offsetting its negative effects on activity after that crisis period.The structure of the arrangements up until 31 December 2022 were similar to previous periods  however from the calendar year 2022 mental health services are excluded as they are now reimbursed under a bundled payment structure. The French Government prolonged its support to the industry through a modified revenue guarantee scheme for the calendar year up to 31 December 2023. This new guarantee amounts to 70% of the 2022 guarantee (tariff adjusted) plus 30% of the period billings.The amount of the revenue guarantee recognised by the Group for the half year ending 31 December 2023 amounts to €38.9 million (€62.2 million for the previous period) and was reported as “Other operating income”.Furthermore  significant grants recognised in the prior period as “Other operating income” have been either discontinued  such as compensation grants for additional costs related to COVID (prior period €20m) or transferred into an increase in tariffs since March 2023  such as specific grants funding inflation and mandated salary increases (prior period €45m).The group continued its expansion in its core strategic development areas:The first day mental health facility opened in Orleans in January 2024  to be followed shortly by a second one in the Ile de France region.A further 6 new imaging equipment have been installed and started their activity during the semester.Nordic countriesPatient demand continued to underpin the growth of the nordic countries facilities  with higher activity volumes and cost inflation remediation measures supporting the revenue and operating profit of the acute care facilities in Sweden. Capio has started operating two new geriatrics care contracts in Stockholm on 1st May 2023 representing an annual turnover of approximately €50m  and St Göran has opened its new maternity ward in Stockholm on 1st April 2023  supporting further organic growth in this half-year. Denmark revenue has been negatively impacted by new public contract tariffs effective since June 2023 and disappointing volumes. Norway is focusing on cost control actions and have been able to apply inflation increases in their revenue rates.Scope of consolidationRamsay Santé completed 2 small acquisitions in Denmark in connection with the activity of its existing subsidiary WeCare. Moreover  Ramsay Santé has increased its shareholding to 70% in WeCare by buying back minority partners. WeCare was already fully consolidated.Comments on the half-year accountsActivity and revenue:Activity and revenue in France and the Nordic countries have grown across the board reflecting sustained patient demand and the capacity of the group’s facilities to provide more care services despite staffing challenges from competition for nursing staff in Europe. Ramsay Santé Group reported a consolidated revenue of €2 370.1m for the half-year ended 31 December 2023  up 7.3% on a reported basis. Adjusted for changes in the consolidation scope and at constant currency exchange rates  revenue for the half year ended 31 December 2023 was up with a solid 9.4% organic sales growth.France revenue has grown by 9.2%  reflecting in part the March 2023 tariff increase  supported by an increase in volumes and in revenue medical purchases rechargeable revenue  and despite 1 less business day this semester compared to last year’s and the continuing shift towards a greater ambulatory care mix.France total admissions in our hospitals rose by 5.1%  extending and confirming the contribution of the group’s facilities to address the post-Covid backlog of elective hospital care:+4.7% in MSO (medicine  surgery and obstetrics)+12.3% in FCR (follow-up care and rehabilitation)-1.2% in mental healthOur French facilities managed approximately 350 000 emergency presentations this semester  confirming their important role in delivering on public service missions.Nordic countries reported revenue grew by +3.4% and was penalised by foreign exchange fluctuation by €57.6m by unfavourable foreign exchange rate. Organic revenue growth in the Nordic countries for the half year ending 31 December 2023 was +10.5% on a like-for-like basis from continued positive revenue growth acute care facilities in Sweden  together with the contribution of new contracts. Patients listed in our proximity care centres increased by 1% on the prior period.Results:EBITDA reached €284.6m for the half year ending 31 December 2023  down €28.1m or 9.0% on the prior period on a reported basis.The Group's EBITDA as at 31 December 2023 includes €38.9 million (€62.2 million for the previous period) related to the revenue guarantee described in the paragraph “Significant events of the half-year”. With Covid abating to a mainstream endemic status in 2023  no Covid costs compensations grants were received in the period (€28.4m prior period).EBITDA and margins were also driven down by inflationary pressures sustained from the impact of the effort made on the compensations and benefits made to our medical staff as well as overall operating expenditure price increases  in particular on energy and outsourced services. Ramsay Santé received funding through French tariff increases and Nordics agreements indexation with various public payors which only partially covered procurement and wages inflation.Cost control measures were sustained to adapt activities to the current inflation environment and resources allocation are also revisited as a consequence.Underlying current operating profit amounted to €85.9m for the half year ended 31 December 2023 (or 3.6% of revenue)  down 36.2% on the previous period.Other non-current income and expenses represent a net income of €7.7m for the half year ending 31 December 2023 (prior period €21.6m)  consisting mainly of a €15.1m profit on the remeasurement of options to buy back minority interests in the Nordic countries  in particular reflecting updated agreements further to the increase in shareholding in WeCare in Denmark.The cost of net financial debt amounted to €87.3m for the half year ending 31 December 2023  compared with €68.7m in the previous period  driven by higher funding costs. The impact of financial instruments recorded in P&L was a €11.9m expense (€10.8m income in the prior period)  contributing a further €22.7m increase in the net interest expense on the prior period. In accordance with IFRS 16  the Group recorded a financial interest expense of €39.9m related to lease debt (€37.0m the previous period).The group share of net income after tax for the half year ended 31 December 2023 was a loss of €(17.3)m compared to the prior period net profit of €43.9mImpact from IFRS16 Lease :Reported EBITDA of €284.6m in accordance with IFRS16 excludes contracted lease expenses for €125.8m which are instead recorded as amortisation of the right-of-use asset and interest on the lease debt as outlined in the table below. The increase in the lease accounting impact on the prior period primarily came from the effect of price indexation mechanism.EUR millions31 December 2023 31 December 2022 Δ IFRS16 Impact Pre-IFRS16 IFRS16 Impact Pre-IFRS16 Impact EBITDA 284.6 125.8 158.8 312.7 117.1 195.6 8.7 Depreciation & amortisation (206.4) (101.1) (105.3) (199.6) (94.6) (105.0) (6.5) EBIT before non-current items 78.2 24.7 53.5 113.1 22.5 90.6 2.2 Net interest expense (101.4) (37.7) (63.7) (66.5 (35.7 (30.8) (2.0) Net profit after tax (13.4) (9.3) (4.1) 47.0 (9.8) 56.8 0.5Cash-flow and financing :Reported net financial debt on 31 December 2023 was €3 869.9m compared with €3 670.0m on 30 June 2023. IAS 17 Net debt includes €1 876.6m in non-current borrowings and €60.1m in current borrowings  offset by €188.6m in cash and cash equivalents.The application of IFRS 16 to leases contributed €2 172.8m to net financial debt as of 31 December 2023  of which €1 942.9m was non-current lease debt and €229.9m was current lease debt.Net cash decreased by €163.6m over the half-year  which is seasonally generates lower liquidity from operations than the January to June period. This includes net borrowings repayments of €21.0m. The cash flow from operating activities was subdued from an unfavourable working capital variation encompassing the absence of collection of accrued revenue guarantee income  and higher interest paid.Total capital expenditure for the period of €84.7m was slightly below last year’s €91.0m and included maintenance and optimisation  as well as improvement on our portfolio of clinics. Significant effort is sustained to roll out our strategy to increase Ramsay Santé’s imaging assets portfolio  to invest on digital tools  and to acquire new equipment.About Ramsay SantéRamsay Santé is the leader in private hospitalisation and primary care in Europe.

Consolidated net sales rose organically by +6.4%  driven in particular by the very good performances of Bureau Veritas and Crisis Prevention Institute. Our companies also pressed ahead with their targeted external growth strategies.We are deploying the new strategic directions announced in March 2023  with a strong portfolio rotation  with the acquisition of a majority stake in the Scalian Group  and the sale of Constantia Flexibles at a price above Net Asset Value.In October  we announced the ongoing acquisition of IK Partners  a major step in the deployment of the Wendel transforming strategy. It will be the foundation of the private asset management division we are building.Implementing this ambitious strategy allows to accelerate Wendel’s diversification  to boost recurring cash flow generation and to enhance our attractiveness as an investor and as a listed company.The combined growth of our Principal investments activity and our Asset management activity  coupled with disciplined cost management  give us confidence in our ability to offer our shareholders growing and recurring dividends  starting now with a dividend increase of +25% to a level representing 2.5% of NAV. 2023 was a year of transformation for Wendel  and I would like to extend my warmest thanks to the Wendel teams who are so skilfully supporting this project.”2023 net sales2023 consolidated net sales(in millions of euros) 2022 2023 Δ Organic Δ Bureau Veritas 5 650.6 5 867.8 +3.8% +8.5% Stahl(1) 914.9 913.5 -0.2% -8.3% CPI 114.2 128.0 +12.1% +15.6% ACAMS(2) 66.2 91.6 n.a. +12.0%(3) Scalian(4) n.a. 126.8 n.a. n.a.

The organic increase was +8.5%  benefiting from very solid trends across most businesses and most geographies. In the fourth quarter  organic growth stood at a strong +9.4%.Three businesses delivered double-digit organic revenue growth  with Industry up +16.5%  Marine & Offshore +14.4% and Certification +12.4%. Two businesses delivered mid-single-digit organic revenue growth  with Buildings & Infrastructure (B&I) up +6.3% and Agri-Food & Commodities up +5.7%. Consumer Products Services saw a nearly stable organic revenue growth  down -0.5% (including a +3.8% recovery in Q4 2023).The scope effect was a positive +0.6% reflecting the bolt-on acquisitions realized in the previous year partly offset by a small disposal in the third quarter (explaining a negative impact of -0.4% in the last quarter). Currency fluctuations had a negative impact of -5.3% (including a negative impact of -6.4% in the fourth quarter)  mainly due to the strength of the Euro against the US dollar and pegged currencies and some emerging countries’ currencies.Adjusted operating profit increased by +3.1% to €930.2 million. The 2023 adjusted operating margin decreased by 11 basis points to 15.9%  including a 32 basis-point negative foreign exchange impact and a 1 basis point positive scope impact. Organically  the adjusted operating margin increased by +20 basis points to 16.2% (of which c.50 basis point was delivered in the second half of 2023). This illustrates good progress in operational excellence programs  and the disciplined execution of pricing programs.Solid financial positionAt the end of December 2023  the Group’s adjusted net financial debt decreased compared with the level at December 31  2022. Bureau Veritas has a solid financial structure with most of its maturities to be refinanced after 2024.

Organic decrease of -8.3%  in a context of destocking and relatively weak demand in the chemical industry. EBITDA margin up at 22.3% with cashflow generation ahead of 2022. €125 million dividend paid to shareholders in December 2023.(Full consolidation)Stahl  the world leader in specialty coatings for flexible substrates  posted total sales of €913.5 million in 2023  stable versus 2022. Organic growth was -8.3%  in the context of muted market demand across Leather and Coatings. FX contributed negatively (-1.6%)  mostly through USD weakening against the Euro. External growth (+9.7%)  driven by the acquisition of ISG in March 2023  offset the destocking and sluggish demand.On a quarterly basis  Stahl’s business showed a returning demand in H2  as the decline in organic growth significantly reduced compared to previous quarters: in Q3 2023  Stahl’s sales organically decreased by -3.4%  and in Q4 by -0.4% compared to -15.4% and -13.1% in Q2 and Q1 respectively.On March 16  2023  the Stahl Group acquired 100% of the shares (EV of c.$205 million) in ICP Industrial Solutions Group (ISG)  a leader in high-performance packaging coatings which reinforces Stahl’s position as the global leader in the field of specialty coatings for flexible materials.

Stahl remained highly cash generative  notably thanks to the good EBITDA level. Management’ successful integration of ISG  generated higher than estimated synergies and on a much faster timeline.As a result  net debt as of December 31  2023  was €329.0 million9  after the ICP acquisition and the payment to its shareholders of a 125 million euros dividend in December 2023  vs. €98 million end of December 2022.

EBITDA and Net debt are post IFRS 16)Scalian  a European leader in digital transformation  project management and operational performance consulting  reported like-for-like growth of +15.7% in 2023  with annual sales at December 31  2023 of €541.4 million. This performance  above that of its peers  is particularly remarkable given the slowdown in growth observed in its industry since March 2023.Scalian generated EBITDA16 of €65.8 million in 2023  up 22.7% in 2023 on a like-for-like basis. The EBITDA margin thus stood at 12.2%  slightly up compared to 2022. Compared with H1 2023  EBITDA margin is slightly down  mainly due to the slippage of expected projects by Scalian’s customers  translating into lower utilization rate. Since September 2023  Scalian has adapted to the market conditions by limiting its recruitment volume to optimize its utilization rate  while adjusting its initially planned SG&A investments.Net debt17 stands at €303.6 million  representing a leverage of 5.9x18 EBITDA  giving Scalian a comfortable headroom in relation to its covenants (limit of 8.5x). In terms of recent news  Scalian announced the acquisition of Dulin Technology in January 2024  a Spanish-based consulting firm specializing in cybersecurity for the financial sector  and the recruitment of Nathalie Senechault  former CFO of the Atos Group  as its new CFO in January 2024.Scalian seeks to achieve sales of €1.5 billion by 2028.Tarkett – Organic sales growth of +4.5% driven by record turnover in the Sports segment.Increase in adjusted EBITDA value and margin thanks to a solid performance in Sports and recovery in North America.

Organic growth reached +4.5% and remains unchanged including selling price increases in the CIS region (selling price adjustments in the CIS countries are historically intended to offset currency movements and are therefore excluded from the organic growth calculation).The effect of selling price increases mainly implemented during the second half of 2022 is on average +3.9% over 2023 and contributed mainly to the first half of the financial year. Volumes were generally stable over the entire year with contrasting situations depending on activities and geographies. Sports experienced strong growth again (+20.2%)  volumes in CIS improved after the sharp fall in 2022 and North American Commercial activity held on track over the financial year in a market that remains complicated. On the other hand  Residential activities in North America and Europe fell sharply as a result of the drop in real estate transactions. The currency effect was unfavorable over the year (-4.5%)  mainly due to the depreciation of the ruble and the dollar.Adjusted EBITDA amounted to €287.8 million  i.e. 8.6% of revenue  compared to €234.9 million in 2022  i.e. 7.0% of revenue.The Group generated a positive free cash flow for the year of €147.1 million  a very strong increase from 2022 (- €148.3 million)  thanks to the improvement in EBITDA and the significant reduction in working capital requirements.At the end of the 2023 financial year  the Group had a good level of liquidity amounting to €656 million comprising the undrawn RCF in an amount of €350 million at the end of December 2023  other confirmed and unconfirmed credit lines in an amount of €82 million and €224 million in cash.For more information: https://www.tarkett-group.com/en/investors/IHS Towers – IHS Towers will report its FY 2023 results in March 2024Wendel Growth: 4 new direct investments in 2023Wendel Growth made four direct investments in 2023:In January  €15 million invested in Tadaweb.

Wendel made an equity investment of €15.5 million to support the Company’s growth. Aqemia develops a first-in-class technological platform (the Launchpad) combining quantum-inspired physics and machine learning. The technology developed by the Company aims to quickly and accurately predict the affinity between a molecule and a target  hence accelerating drug discovery.AlphaSense  the leading IA powered market intelligence and search platform  of which Wendel is a minority shareholder ($2.7 million invested)  announced two financing rounds in 2023  leading its valuation to $2.5 billion.Total investments and commitments to date stand at €235 million  of which €180 million committed in funds and around €55 million in direct investments.Sale of Constantia FlexiblesAfter obtaining the necessary authorizations  Wendel announced on January 4  2024  that it had completed the sale of Constantia Flexibles (“The Company”) to an affiliate of One Rock Capital Partners  LLC (“One Rock”).

Compared to the last 20-day average share price as of December 31  the discount to the December 31  2023 NAV per share was of -50.1%.Wendel’s NAV methodology is now aligned with IPEV GuidelinesWendel’s NAV methodology has been updated to incorporate the recommendations of the industry market standard International Private Equity Valuation Guidelines (IPEV)   under which NAV is based on management’s best estimate of Fair Value.The main adjustment concerns the methodology for the calculation of the NAV of the unlisted assets  where the progressive fadeout of the acquisition multiple is no longer used and the calibration principle is implemented  in line with IPEV Guidelines. While listed peers’ multiples remain the main calculation methodology  in the event a significant gap with the acquisition multiple is identified  a calibration coefficient can be applied. The calibration process is strongly recommended by IPEV and is widely used in the industry.This application of the updated methodology has impacted Wendel’s December 31  2023 NAV by €+2.3 per share  or approximately +1.4%).The full methodology is available on Wendel’s website.Renewal of term and new Supervisory Board member to be submitted to the 2024 Shareholders’ MeetingIt will be proposed to shareholders to renew for a further four-year term Thomas de Villeneuve as member of the Supervisory Board.Non-financial ratings: Wendel confirms its inclusion in the DJSI World and Europe and improves its CDP scoreDJSIFor the fourth year in a row  Wendel has been included in the Dow Jones Sustainability (DJSI) World and Europe indices  making it one of the top 10% of companies in terms of sustainability in the Diversified Financials category.

Nexity will adapt to this new reality more quickly in 2024  by making adjustments that will enable it to sell supply designed during the previous cycle  scaling its organisation to match new market conditions with respect to volume  and switching to an operating model focused on local areas in order to meet the demand for our services as an urban operator even more effectively.This means that we will recognise the costs of these transformations  including the implementation of a redundancy plan  in 2024  and will continue to refocus the strategic roadmap and deleverage the business. To do so  we will minimise risk as we ramp up urban regeneration activities with operational partners  and we will- continue seeking out strategic and financial partnerships in services  particularly in the management and distribution businesses.Having reinforced our financial structure  Nexity is in a position to convert all the growth opportunities offered by the emerging new real estate cycle  as evidenced by initial positive indicators  and to extend our leadership  as we have succeeded in doing after every previous market crisis.”KEY FIGURES FOR 2023Business activity – France 2022 2023 Change Reservations: Residential Real EstateVolume 18 015 units 14 602 units -19% Value €3 924m €2 964m -24% Development backlog €6.1bn €5.4bn -12% Financial results (in €m) 2022 2023 Change Revenue 4 704 4 273 -9% Operating profit 367 246 -33% Operating margin (as % of revenue) 7.8% 5.7% -210 bps Group share of net profit 188 19 Net debt1 820 776 x EBITDA after lease payments2 1.5x 2.5x1 Net debt before lease liabilities and following application of IFRS 5 after entering into exclusive negotiations on 21 December 2023 for the sale of the Property Management for Individuals business.2 Leverage ratio calculated in accordance with contractual terms set out in financing agreements (IFRS reporting).PERFORMANCE BY DIVISIONRESIDENTIAL REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENTBusiness activityIn a highly challenging market  Nexity’s business activity showed resilience: 14 602 reservations were booked  down 19% in a market that declined by 26%. The total value of these reservations was €2 964 million (down 24%). The latest FPI statement  dated 15 February  reported 94 828 reservations in the market  a record low for the past 10 years.As expected  and in line with market data  retail sales declined sharply (down 41% compared with 2022)  mainly due to lower solvency among individual clients arising from the substantial  lasting rise in interest rates and the drop in implied yields for individual investors. Sales to individual investors and homebuyers fell to an all-time low  accounting for 21% and 12% of total sales  respectively.Bulk sales remained strong  holding steady year on year: Nexity continued to pursue its dynamic sales strategy  in place since 2022  earmarking retail sale reservations for bulk sales  through its long-term partnerships with private and public landlords.Bulk sales accounted for 67% of total reservations at year-end 2023  up 13 percentage points from 2022  driven in particular by bulk sales of intermediate housing  which more than doubled year on year  peaking at 16%.The difference between the change in reservations by volume and by value is mainly due to the change in the product mix.Supply for sale at year-end 2023 was down 23% relative to year-end 2022  at 7 778 units  with take-up periods stable at around 7 months. These trends reflected the Group’s increasingly selective approach to launching programmes (the average rate of pre-selling was nearly 75%2 on programmes launched in 2023) and demonstrated its ability to adapt its supply despite a slower pace of sales. Developments under construction accounted for around 46% of the total supply for sale (vs. 60% for the market as a whole) and the stock of unsold completed units remained marginal  at around one hundred.Financial performance(in millions of euros) 2022(1) 2023 Change Revenue 3 385 2 942 -13% Operating profit 280 140 -50% Margin (as % of revenue) 8.3% 4.8% -350 bps(1) Reclassification of Villes & Projets (historically classified in the Other Activities division) in Residential Real Estate DevelopmentRevenue declined by 13% in 2023 to €2 942 million  reflecting the slower pace of signings of notarial deeds of sale since the beginning of the year and fewer new programmes launched into the construction phase.Operating profit was €140 million (down 50%)  representing a margin of 4.8%  down 350 basis points. This change was mainly due to the decrease in revenue  the change in the customer mix with a higher proportion of bulk sales  higher construction costs affecting the budgets of certain programmes under construction  and the slowdown in business  which has affected the balance of overhead costs.Outlook:The backlog stands at €5.0 billion  representing two years’ revenue.The Carrefour partnership announced in 2023  which is fully aligned with the Group’s increased emphasis on urban regeneration  reached a key milestone at the end of November with the formation of the “Villes et Commerces” land banking joint venture. As a reminder  this partnership covers the upgrade of 76 Carrefour sites across France through urban mixed-use projects  including 12 000 homes  and will generate revenue at termination of over €2 billion over the next ten years (developments will be included in the backlog with effect from H2 2024).In early October  the French government made an initial revision to the country’s zoning map  reclassifying more than 150 municipalities as supply-constrained areas (A/Abis/B1)  meaning they are now eligible for the “Pinel” scheme  intermediate rental housing (LLI) and the 2024 PTZ interest-free loan scheme  and in some cases raising rent ceilings  which in turn improves rental yields. This zoning extension will enable Nexity to recalibrate developments currently being set up in the municipalities concerned  and to sell its available supply more quickly. For reference  81% of Nexity’s current supply for sale is located in supply-constrained areas.COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENTBusiness activityWith the market at a cyclical low  marked by higher interest rates and changes in usage for commercial real estate (according to CBRE  investment in France was down 56% in 2023)  as forecast  Nexity recorded a low volume of new orders in 2023 (€39 million).In 2023  the Group delivered 12 developments totalling over 100 000 square metres  including the following iconic developments:Deloitte University : 23 385-square-metre low-carbon business park standing on 14.7 hectares of land in a natural setting : 23 385-square-metre low-carbon business park standing on 14.7 hectares of land in a natural setting  Aqueduc business park : Nearly 40 000 square metres of office space developed in Gentilly : Nearly 40 000 square metres of office space developed in Gentilly  Facette development: 5 200 square metres of office space at the heart of the Belvédère development in Bordeaux  Nexity’s new regional head office.These developments bring total deliveries over the past five years to nearly 700 000 square metres  including almost 200 000 square metres of logistics facilities  warehouses and business parks and over 50 000 square metres of higher education facilities  reflecting continuing diversity in the new business written by the Group.Financial performance(in millions of euros) 2022 2023 Change Revenue 380 459 +21% Operating profit 45 41 -9% Margin (as % of revenue) 11.9% 8.9% -300 bpsAt year-end 2023  revenue totalled €459 million and operating profit was €41 million  driven  as in 2022  by the contribution of the green business park in La Garenne-Colombes  which is 75% completed.Outlook15 developments in progress at year-end 2023  totalling more than 200 000 square metres and ~€350 million  including the following:Green business park in La Garenne-Colombes : 95 000-square-metre project scheduled for delivery in Q2 and Q4 2024  contributing €250 million to secure 2024 revenue.: 95 000-square-metre project scheduled for delivery in Q2 and Q4 2024  contributing €250 million to secure 2024 revenue. Carré Invalides (Paris): Renovation of the 15 400-square-metre former headquarters of the Greater Paris regional council(Paris): Renovation of the 15 400-square-metre former headquarters of the Greater Paris regional council Confluence business park (Lyon): Mixed development incorporating a 15 000-square-metre higher education campus.(Lyon): Mixed development incorporating a 15 000-square-metre higher education campus. Reiwa: New construction of Nexity’s future head office  totalling around 25 000 square metres  in Saint-Ouen (Seine-Saint-Denis).While the market for off-plan sales remained buoyant outside the Paris region  the Group continued to capitalise on its integrated expertise and positioning to step up its role supporting institutional clients with urban regeneration projects under delegated project ownership and CPI development contracts.The backlog stood at €349 million at year-end 2023.ServicesServices revenue was €872 million at year-end 2023  down very slightly and once again driven by Managed Real Estate (Serviced Properties):(in millions of euros) 2022 2023 Change Revenue 938 872 -7% o/w: Property Management3 382 385 +1% o/w: Serviced Properties 217 270 +25% o/w: Distribution 340 217 -36% Operating profit 92 73 -21% Margin (as % of revenue) 9.8% 8.3% -150 bpsRevenue from Property Management (Property Management for Individuals and Property Management for Companies) grew slightly  up 1% to €385 million  confirming the resilience of the condominium and rental management businesses  with a portfolio of nearly 825 000 units under management at year-end 2023 and significant contracts renewed or signed  an example being Nexity Property Management’s successful bid to manage over 4 000 sites on behalf of the Orange group. Meanwhile  rental intermediation-related business lines (sales and lettings) were affected in 2023 by the rise in interest rates and very tight supply in the rental market.The Serviced Properties business (serviced residences for students  coworking spaces) posted €270 million in revenue (up 25%)  driven in particular by the strong growth momentum of the portfolio of coworking businesses (16 new sites and an increase of nearly 24 000 square metres under management)  as well as occupancy rates  which remained high at end-December for both coworking spaces (96%4) and student residences (97%).Lastly  as expected  revenue from Distribution activities (down 36%) reflected the downturn in the new home market. It should however be noted that reservation volumes decreased less than did the individual investor market  and that the market share for distribution activities grew by two points (totalling 10.3%).Operating profit for the Services business totalled €73 million at year-end 2023  down 21%  mainly due to lower profitability in the Distribution business  reflecting the downturns in the new home and brokerage markets. Excluding Distribution  profit grew by 8%.Outlook:After announcing at end-October that it had initiated a process to seek out strategic and financial partnerships in its management and distribution businesses  Nexity announced on 21 December that it had entered into exclusive negotiations with a view to selling 100% of its Real Estate Services to Individuals activities to Bridgepoint  a European leader in alternative asset management  based on an enterprise value of €440 million. This transaction  expected to be finalised in the first half of the year  involves the launch of a long-term5 strategic partnership aimed at amplifying existing synergies with Nexity’s businesses and securing their long-term future. The agencies will continue to assist with the pre-deliveries of our new buildings and provide condominium management services  we will offer dedicated rental management services to our individual investors  we will be the preferred developer for land banking and real estate projects (such as extensions to existing buildings through additional storeys)  and we will have access to the client base to promote our range of services and solutions.CONSOLIDATED RESULTS – OPERATIONAL REPORTINGDue to the process underway for the sale of Real Estate Services to Individuals activities  which is expected to be finalised in the first half of the year  the Group is applying IFRS 5 (on assets held for sale)  which requires the assets and liabilities of these activities to be presented separately from other continuing operations in the balance sheet.

Revenue from Residential Real Estate Development was down 13%  due to the slowdown in business in a highly unfavourable environment.business was down 10%  mainly driven by the revenue generated through major projects in Commercial Real Estate (the green business park in La Garenne-Colombes and Nexity’s headquarters in Saint-Ouen). Revenue from Residential Real Estate Development was down 13%  due to the slowdown in business in a highly unfavourable environment. Revenue from Services was down 7%  with the surge in revenue for the Serviced Properties business (up 25% compared with 2022) not enough to offset the decline in revenue from Distribution  which was affected by the downturn in the new home market.In IFRS terms  revenue in 2023 totalled €3 964 million  down 9% relative to 2022. This figure excludes revenue from joint ventures  in accordance with IFRS 11  which requires these ventures – proportionately consolidated in the Group’s operational reporting – to be accounted for using the equity method. It should be noted that revenue generated by the development businesses from VEFA off-plan sales and CPI development contracts is recognised using the percentage-of-completion method  i.e. on the basis of notarised sales and pro-rated to reflect the progress of all inventoriable costs.OPERATING PROFIT2022(1) 2023 (in millions of euros) Current operatingprofit MarginCurrent operatingprofit MarginDevelopment 326 8.6% 181 5.3% Residential Real Estate Development 280 8.3% 140 4.8% Commercial Real Estate Development 45 11.9% 41 8.9% Services 92 9.8% 73 8.3% Other Activities (51) N/A (48) N/A Operating profit 367 7.8% 246 5.7%(1) Reclassification of Villes & Projets (historically classified in the Other Activities division) in Residential Real Estate DevelopmentOperating profit was €246 million  in line with guidance.OTHER INCOME STATEMENT ITEMSThe net financial expense totalled €108 million. In particular  it comprised an increase of nearly €25 million in financing costs due to the rise in interest rates (with 51% of total debt made up of floating-rate debt at year-end 2023) and an €8 million increase in finance costs on lease liabilities driven by growth in the portfolio of managed real estate.The tax expense (including the CVAE7) amounted to €51 million. The current effective tax rate (excluding the CVAE) was 35% (28% at year-end 2022). This rate  which was 9 points higher than our normative rate  mainly resulted from international losses that were not recoverable against French taxes  as well as the tax on the long-term disposal gain following the transfer of Studéa shares from Property Management for Individuals to Nexity SA.The decrease in “Share of profit/(loss) from equity-accounted investments” primarily arose from the 18% stake in Ægide Domitys.The Group share of net profit came to €19 million at 31 December 2023.FINANCIAL STRUCTUREDEBT AND LIQUIDITYThe Group’s net debt before lease liabilities amounted to €776 million at year-end 2023  down €43 million compared to 2022  in line with its debt management policy announced at the beginning of the year.This decrease notably reflects the following:Strict management of working capital in an adverse environment due to a more selective approach before projects are launched and the simultaneous start of construction work and signing of deeds when new land is purchasedDiscontinuation of business outside France and disposal of activities in Poland and Portugal finalised in Q3  with a €100 million impact on net debtDebt at 31 December 2023 takes into account the impact of IFRS 5 application on Property Management for Individuals and thus includes a corresponding €67 million adjustment.The Group was in compliance with all its financial ratios as at end-December 2023. The leverage ratio8  calculated in accordance with contractual terms set out in financing agreements  stood at 2.5x  below the limit set out in the financial covenant (3.5x).(in millions of euros) 31 Dec. 2022 31 Dec. 2023 Change Bond issues and other 976 821 (155) Bank borrowings and commercial paper 874 837 (37) Net cash and cash equivalents (1 030) (882) +149 Net financial debt before lease liabilities 820 776 -43Overall  nearly 50% of the Group’s gross debt is fixed-rate debt  limiting its exposure to rising interest rates. The Group has also put in place interest rate hedges  bringing the proportion of its gross debt that is either well hedged or at fixed rates to over 60%.At 31 December 2023  the average maturity of the Group’s debt remained above two years (2 years and 4 months)  with an average cost of borrowing of 3.8%.The Group’s liquidity is solid  with total cash and cash equivalents of €882 million  and €630 million in confirmed undrawn credit lines.As a reminder  in February 2023  the Group renewed its corporate credit line for a period of 5 years with an expanded pool of banks and for an increased amount (€800 million versus €500 million).WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENT(in millions of euros) 31 Dec. 2022 31 Dec. 2023 Change Development 1 322 1 316 (6) Residential Real Estate Development 1 199 1 240 +41 Commercial Real Estate Development 123 76 (47) Services 36 62 +27 Other Activities (23) (39) (15) Total WCR excluding tax 1 335 1 340 +5 Corporate income tax (11) 7 +17 Working capital requirement (WCR) 1 324 1 346 +23The Group’s working capital requirement  after adjusting working capital in the Property Management for Individuals business in accordance with IFRS 5  stood at €1 346 million at year-end 2023  mainly due to the slowdown in business and thus in sales of inventory. Excluding tax and before the adjustment relating to IFRS 5  the working capital requirement declined €39 million.It mainly consists of secure operating items (receivables due from individual clients guaranteed by banks  and receivables due from institutional clients relating to top-tier counterparties) and includes an almost 40% reduction in the land bank  which stood at €171 million at 31 December 2023.CLIMATE AND BIODIVERSITY: STRONG PERFORMANCE IN 2023In 2023  Nexity continued to roll out its ambitious strategy in support of resilient low-carbon cities  thus helping accelerate the sustainability transition in the real estate sector.1.5°C carbon trajectory validated by SBTi (the Science Based Targets initiative) in July 2023  with the Group joining the Euronext CAC SBT 1.5 index(the Science Based Targets initiative) in July 2023  with the Group joining the Euronext CAC SBT 1.5 index CDP score 9 upgraded to A- “Leadership”   notably in recognition of the Group’s carbon reduction targets across its entire value chain and high-quality environmental reporting  notably in recognition of the Group’s carbon reduction targets across its entire value chain and high-quality environmental reporting Partnership between Nexity and the Net Zero Initiative for Real Estate  which aims to draw up guidelines so that the real estate sector helps achieve the global net-zero targetLower carbon emissions – Regulatory requirements met or outperformed nearly two years ahead of time: The Group’s aim is to achieve a 42% reduction in its carbon impact per square metre delivered between 2019 and 2030  10% above the level required by France’s RE2020 environmental regulations10. On average in 2023  the Group’s developments at building permit stage outperformed RE2020 requirements by 25% (representing the equivalent of 300 000 metric tons of CO 2 avoided)  thus meeting the new regulatory thresholds nearly two years ahead of time. This performance was notably made possible by the following:Large-scale rollout of heat pumps as well as low-carbon and bio-sourced materialsWork on new construction processes and innovations pursued for many years  as seen in the low-carbon performance of the Athletes’ Village (60 000 square metres)  at under 700 kg of CO 2 per square metreNexity  at the forefront of biodiversity footprint measurement: The Group measured its biodiversity footprint for the first time in 2022 and identified actions across the entire real estate value chain (wood supplies  support from sustainability experts  etc.)  which were included in the Act4Nature commitments  renewed in 2023 for 2024-2026.A Climate and Biodiversity Report presenting the Group’s business strategy and implementation approach will be made available ahead of the Shareholders’ Meeting to be held in May 2024.2023: A BUSY YEAR FOR REFOCUSING THE GROUP’S ROADMAPEven before the persistent market downturn throughout 2023  Nexity had begun proactively concentrating on refocusing its roadmap  speeding up its execution  in line with the following announcements:Discontinuation of business outside France:Disposal of Polish and Portuguese subsidiaries completed in July and September 2023Sale proceeds of around €100 million went towards deleveraging the GroupPivoting more quickly towards urban regeneration:Launch of Nexity Héritage   a subsidiary specialising in urban regeneration  a subsidiary specialising in urban regeneration First market deal aimed at upgrading 76 Carrefour sites and launching a land banking company:The 76 sites to be regenerated total approximately 800 000 sq.m  and their development will lead to the creation of 12 000 homes  for estimated revenue of over €2 billion spread over 10 years.aimed at upgrading and launching a land banking company: The 76 sites to be regenerated total approximately 800 000 sq.m  and their development will lead to the creation of 12 000 homes  for estimated revenue of over €2 billion spread over 10 years. Land banking solution with Mirabaud AM: The land banking solution offered by Mirabaud AM will cover predominantly residential large-scale property renovation  transformation and/or refurbishment projects and will enable Nexity to outsource up to 90% of the carry risk  for a total investment of up to €200 million over 5 years.Process initiated to seek out strategic and financial partnerships in management and distribution businesses:At year-end 2023  Nexity entered into exclusive negotiations with a view to selling 100% of its Real Estate Services to Individuals activities to Bridgepoint  based on an enterprise value of €440 million.This transaction involves a strategic partnership aimed at amplifying existing synergies with Nexity’s businesses and securing their long-term future.2024: A YEAR OF FAR-REACHING TRANSFORMATIONAlthough interest rates now appear to have plateaued  the sector is likely to continue to face an unfavourable market environment in 2024.After beating the market in 2023  backed by its solid liquidity  Nexity intends to step up actions to adjust its roadmap to adapt to changes in scope and the new market reality  including:Finalisation of the first strategic and financial partnership dealing with real estate services in the first half of the yearReal Estate Services to Individuals activities to be sold to Bridgepoint in the first half of the yearThe only closing condition for authorisation by the European Commission in respect of merger control was met on 20 February 2024.

As such  the Board proposes that the dividend in respect of financial year 2023 be suspended.12Through these transformation initiatives  Nexity is aiming for improved profitability from 2025  and as a result  maximum net debt of €500 million at year-end 2025.The dividend policy will be conducted so as to be consistent with the context and reviewed annually in light of free cash flow.Thanks to an agile  deleveraged  regionally focused multi-product organisation  at the end of this year of transformation Nexity will be in a position to seize the opportunities offered by the impending change in the real estate cycle.Forecast for 2024Operating profit to remain positive while reaching a low point   taking into account gains on disposals  the costs of adjusting supply to new market conditions and costs relating to the Group’s reorganisation  paving the way for a rebound in 2025  taking into account gains on disposals  the costs of adjusting supply to new market conditions and costs relating to the Group’s reorganisation  Net financial debt considerably lower than at the end of 2023*****FINANCIAL CALENDAR & PRACTICAL INFORMATIONQ1 2024 revenue and business activity Thursday  25 April 2024 (after market close)(after market close) Shareholders’ Meeting Thursday  23 May 20242024 interim results Thursday  25 July 2024 (after market close)(after market close) Q3 2024 revenue and business activity Thursday  24 October 2024 (after market close)A conference call will be held today in French  with simultaneous translation into English  at 6:45 p.m. (Paris time)  which can be joined via the “Finance” section of our website  https://nexity.group/en/finance  or by calling one of the following numbers:Calling from France +33 (0)1 70 37 71 66 Calling from elsewhere in Europe +44 (0)33 0551 0200 Calling from the United States +1 786 697 3501Code: Nexity FR / Nexity ENThe presentation accompanying this conference will be available on the Group’s website from 6:30 p.m. (Paris time) and may be viewed at the following address: Nexity FY 2023 webcastThe conference call will be available on replay at www.nexity.group/en/finance from the following day.Disclaimer:Audit procedures by the Statutory Auditors for the consolidated financial statements are being finalised and the corresponding report will be issued shortly.The information  assumptions and estimates that the Company could reasonably use to determine its targets are subject to change or modification  notably due to economic  financial and competitive uncertainties.

UMG's Recorded Music  Music Publishing and Merchandising and Other segments all had strong revenue growth  as discussed further below.EBITDA for the quarter grew 6.6% year-over-year  or 13.3% in constant currency  to €564 million  driven by the revenue growth. EBITDA margin was 17.6%  compared to 18.0% in the fourth quarter of 2022. EBITDA and EBITDA margin were impacted by non-cash share-based compensation expenses of €113 million during the fourth quarter of 2023  and by €91 million of non-cash share-based compensation expenses during the fourth quarter of 2022. Excluding these amounts  Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was €677 million  up 9.2% year-over-year  or 15.1% in constant currency  driven by the revenue growth and €22 million in cash compensation savings associated with our equity plan rollout. Adjusted EBITDA margin remained constant at 21.1% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022.As detailed in the Appendix  EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA were negatively impacted by a €15 million Legal Provision.

This increase was driven by double-digit improvements across all segments  as discussed further below.As detailed in the Appendix  2023 revenue included the benefit of the Copyright Royalty Board Phonorecords III ruling. 2022 revenue included the benefit from the Change in Society Accounting and the Legal Settlement. Excluding these items from both years  full year revenue grew 8.7%  or 12.4% in constant currency.Cost of revenues  consisting of artist and product costs  increased by 7.9% to €6 208 million in 2023 and Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue increased to 55.9% in 2023 from 55.6% in 2022. Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues increased due a greater proportion of Music Publishing and Merchandising and Other revenues  which have higher Cost of revenues compared to Recorded Music  and an increase in artist costs as a share of revenue due to Recorded Music repertoire mix.Operating profit declined 11.4%  or 8.3% in constant currency  to €1 418 million in 2023 due to the higher non-cash share-based compensation expenses in 2023 compared to 2022 as discussed below.EBITDA of €1 808 million decreased 10.8% year-over-year  or 7.8% in constant currency  and EBITDA margin was 16.3%  compared to 19.6% in the prior year period. EBITDA and EBITDA margin were impacted by non-cash share-based compensation expenses of €561 million during 2023 compared to €107 million during 2022. Excluding these amounts  Adjusted EBITDA was €2 369 million  up 11.0% in 2023  or 14.6% in constant currency  driven by the revenue growth. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved 0.7pp year-over-year to 21.3%.As detailed in the Appendix  EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in 2023 were impacted by the Copyright Royalty Board Phonorecords III ruling and the Legal Provision while EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in 2022 were impacted by the Change in Society Accounting and the Legal Settlement. Excluding these items  Adjusted EBITDA grew 14.9% year-over-year  or 18.5% in constant currency  and Adjusted EBITDA margin increased 1.2pp year-over-year to 21.5%  compared to 20.3% in 2022  despite a margin headwind from repertoire mix and revenue mix  as discussed above.Net profit attributable to equity holders of the parent for 2023 amounted to €1 259 million compared to €782 million in 2022  resulting in Basic EPS of €0.69 in 2023  compared to €0.43 in 2022  and Diluted EPS of €0.68 in 2023  compared to €0.43 in 2022. The increase in Net profit attributable to equity holders of the parent was due in part to the variance in revaluation of investments in listed companies (including Spotify and Tencent Music Entertainment  among others) that was a net income in 2023 of €425 million compared to a net expense in 2022 of €617 million. Adjusted net profit  which adjusts for the revaluation of investments  non-cash share-based compensation expense  amortization of catalogues and other items detailed in the Appendix  amounted to €1 595 million in 2023  compared to €1 454 million in 2022  resulting in Adjusted Basic EPS of €0.88 in 2023  compared to €0.80 in 2022 and Adjusted Diluted EPS of €0.87 in 2023  compared to €0.80 in 2022. The increase in Adjusted net profit was driven by the growth in Adjusted EBITDA.Net debt  defined as total debt minus cash and cash equivalents  at the end of 2023 was €1 689 million compared to €1 810 million at the end of 2022. The net leverage ratio at year-end 2023  defined as Net debt over EBITDA  was 0.9x  consistent with 0.9x at year-end 2022.Net cash provided by operating activities before income tax paid improved 14.6% to €2 278 million compared to €1 987 million in 2022  despite €132 million paid to settle employee tax liabilities from equity grants on non-cash share-based compensation. The improvement in Net cash provided by operating activities before income tax paid was due to the increase in Adjusted EBITDA  favourable working capital movements and lower royalty advance payments  net of recoupments  which declined 32% to €100 million in 2023 from €148 million in 2022  due to the timing of major artist renewals.The strong Net cash provided by operating activities before income tax paid allowed the Company to continue to strategically invest in the long-term growth of the business. Cash paid for catalogue acquisitions decreased to €178 million in 2023 compared to €359 million in 2022 and included the previously announced acquisitions of catalogues from RS Group in Thailand and Oriental Star Agencies  a British label focused on South Asian music  as well as several artist catalogue deals. Separately  investing activities also included €75 million cash put into escrow for another catalogue acquisition. Other strategic investments in the year included the acquisition of a 50% stake in the entity that owns the iconic Capitol Records building in Hollywood and the acquisitions of a brand services company  a niche record label and UAE-based music company Chabaka  among other items. Free cash flow was largely flat at €1 082 million in 2023 compared to €1 086 million in 2022  even with the increase in investing activities detailed above. Free cash flow also reflects higher income taxes paid and higher net interest paid  both of which benefitted from previously disclosed tax settlements in the prior year.In accordance with UMG's dividend policy to pay a dividend of 50% of Net Profit (subject to agreed non-cash items and applicable law)  UMG has proposed to pay a final dividend of €492 million  or €0.27 per share for the year ended December 31  2023. If approved by shareholders  this would bring UMG's total dividend for 2023 to €929 million  or €0.51 per share.

This has affected the timing of the recognition of certain revenues across financial reporting quarters compared to periods before 2022 and also  notably in the second quarter of 2022  reflected the receipt of higher income than was accrued at the end of 2021.Legal SettlementRevenue  EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in 2022 included a benefit from the settlement of a copyright infringement lawsuit with an internet service provider previously disclosed and booked in Q3 2022.CRB Phonorecords III AccrualRevenue  EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in 2023 included the accrual for a catch-up payment from certain DSPs related to the Copyright Royalty Board Phonorecords III ruling in 2023 disclosed and booked in Q3 2023.Legal ProvisionEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in Q4 2023 were negatively impacted by a provision reflected in relation to a decades-old  ongoing artist estate litigation in Latin America.Conference Call DetailsThe Company will host a conference call to discuss these results on Wednesday  February 28  2024 at 6:15PM CET.

These non-IFRS measures (also known as alternative performance indicators) are presented because management considers them important supplemental measures of UMG's performance and believes that they are widely used in the industry in which UMG operates as a means of evaluating a company's operating performance and liquidity. UMG believes that an understanding of its sales performance  profitability  financial strength and funding requirements is enhanced by reporting the following non-IFRS measures. All non-IFRS measures should be considered in addition to  and not as a substitute for  other IFRS measures of operating and financial performance as presented in UMG's Consolidated Financial Statements and the related Notes  or as described in this press release. In addition  it should be noted that other companies may have definitions and calculations for these non-IFRS measures that differ from those used by UMG  thereby affecting comparability.EBITDA and EBITDA marginUMG considers EBITDA and EBITDA margin  non-IFRS measures  to be relevant measures to assess its operating performance and the performance of its operating segments as reported in the segment data. It enables UMG to compare the operating performance of operating segments regardless of whether their performance is driven by the operating segment's organic growth or by acquisitions. It excludes restructuring expenses  which may impact period-to-period comparability. EBITDA margin is EBITDA divided by revenue. To calculate EBITDA  the accounting impact of the following items is excluded from the Operating Profit:i. amortization of intangible assets;ii. impairment on goodwill and other intangibles;iii. depreciation of tangible assets including right of use assets;iv. (gains)/losses on the sale of tangible assets  included right of use assets and intangible assets; andv. restructuring expenses.Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA marginThe difference between EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA consists of non-cash share-based compensation expenses and certain one-time items that are deemed by management to be significant and incidental to normal business activity. Adjusted EBITDA margin is Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue. UMG considers Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin  non-IFRS measures  to be relevant measures to assess performance of its operating activities excluding items that may be incidental to normal business activity and excluding non-cash share based compensation which may impact period-to-period comparability.Adjusted Net Profit/Adjusted Net Profit per shareUMG's use of Adjusted net profit is appropriate as UMG uses it as the basis for the Adjusted net profit per share (in EUR) – diluted  both of which are non-IFRS measures. Adjusted net profit may be subject to limitations as an analytical tool for investors  as it excludes certain items and therefore does not reflect the expense associated with such items  which may be significant and have a significant effect on UMG's net profit. The accounting impact of the following items are excluded from Net profit attributable to equity holders of the parent:i. amortization of catalogues;ii. impairment of goodwill and intangible assets;iii. financial income and expenses  excluding interest and income from investments;iv. earnings from discontinued operations;v. non-cash share-based compensation expense;vi. certain one-time items that are deemed by management to be significant and incidental to normal business activity;vii. income tax impact on the above adjustments;viii. non-recurring tax items; andix. adjustments attributable to non-controlling interests.Financial Net DebtUMG considers Financial Net Debt  a non-IFRS measure  to be a relevant indicator of its liquidity and capital resources. UMG management uses this indicator for reporting  management and planning purposes. Financial Net Debt is calculated as the sum of:i. cash and cash equivalents  as reported in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position  including (i) cash in banks and deposits  whether or not compensated  corresponding to cash  and (ii) money market funds;ii. cash management financial assets  included in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position under ""financial assets""  relating to financial investments  which do not satisfy the criteria for classification as cash equivalents set forth in IAS 7; andiii. derivative financial instruments  net (assets and liabilities) where the underlying instruments are Financial Net Debt items  as well as cash deposits securing borrowings included in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position under ""financial assets""; less:i. the value of borrowings at amortized cost as reported in the Consolidated Statement of Financial PositionFree Cash FlowUMG defines Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by/(used for) operating activities plus net cash provided by/(used for) investing activities  less repayment of lease liabilities  interest paid  net and other cash items related to financing activities. UMG considers Free Cash Flow  a non-IFRS measure  to be a relevant indicator of its cash flow generated to fund dividend payments and repayment of debt. Free Cash Flow is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with IFRS and therefore it should not be considered in isolation of  or as a substitute for cash flow provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity. Free Cash Flow  as we calculate it  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. In addition  Free Cash Flow does not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use and is not necessarily a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs.View original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/universal-music-group-nv-reports-financial-results-for-the-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-ended-december-31-2023-302074199.htmlSOURCE Universal Music Group N.V.",neutral,0.04,0.96,0.01,positive,0.73,0.25,0.01,True,English,"['Universal Music Group N.V.', 'Financial Results', 'Fourth Quarter', 'Full Year', 'Universal Music Group N.V.', 'UAE artist services business Chabaka', 'International Accounting Standards Board', 'International Financial Reporting Standards', 'IFPI Global Recording Artist', 'first artist-centric royalty models', 'Recorded Music subscription revenue', 'Global artist success', 'innovative business models', 'high-growth music markets', 'Summary Q4 2023 Results1', 'The Rolling Stones', 'alternative performance indicators', 'Summary FY 2023 Results1', 'Strategic Organizational Redesign', 'annual run-rate savings', 'Oriental Star Agency', 'South Asian repertoire', 'U.S. Congress', 'creative community interests', ""songwriters' record-breaking performance"", 'final dividend proposal', 'First music company', '€15 million one-time item', 'Adjusted EBITDA margin', 'Responsible AI Initiatives', 'AI content development', 'other operational efficiencies', 'Top 10 global artists', 'RS Group', '2023 Business Highlights', 'Apple Music', 'First phase', 'financial results', 'total dividend', 'innovative partnerships', 'streaming revenue', 'one-time items', 'low-value content', 'other items', 'responsible practices', 'constant currency', 'strong growth', 'Taylor Swift', 'Jung Kook', 'Stray Kids', 'press release', 'Net cash', 'operating activities', 'income tax', 'shareholder approval', 'headcount reduction', 'cost areas', 'labels capabilities', 'fan connections', 'Initial deals', 'DSP platforms', 'catalogue acquisitions', 'British label', 'federal right', 'unethical uses', 'early-stage entrepreneurs', 'key principles', 'fourth quarter', 'Top sellers', 'historic partnership', 'long-term strategy', 'thoughtful investment', 'IFRS measures', 'Year chart', 'full year', 'exceptional year', 'Top 20', 'segments', 'headwind', 'Drake', 'descriptions', 'reconciliations', 'Appendix', 'combination', 'Plan', 'targeted', 'Spotify', 'songs', 'Implementation', 'Deezer', 'fans', 'fraud', 'gaming', 'amount', 'Progress', 'Thailand', 'publicity', 'deepfakes', 'YouTube', 'HILVERSUM', 'Netherlands', 'Feb.', 'UMG', 'work', 'industry', 'leadership', 'nex']",2024-02-28,2024-02-29,marketscreener.com

Income tax was €53.0 million  of which €42.0 million deferred taxes from the revaluation of EUROAPI Hungary assets. The revaluation was triggered by the tax treatment applied by Sanofi in 2023 to the transfer of the Hungarian business to EUROAPI as part of the carve-out in 2021 and the subsequent exit of EUROAPI from Sanofi10.Net income was €(189.7) million in 2023. Excluding the impact of the €42.0 million deferred tax asset from the revaluation of EUROAPI Hungary assets and the €(226.4) millions of impairment on non-current assets triggered by the strategic review  the 2023 net income would have been €5.3 million.Core Free Cash Flow(in € millions) FY-2023 FY-2022 Cash flow provided by operating activities 5.1 44.8 Net change in other current assets and other current liabilities and current taxes 24.3 26.5 Acquisitions of property plant and equipment and intangible assets (132.8) (167.4) Intangible assets relating to the carve-out and Group IT set up 3.8 29.1 Restructuring costs and similar items – inflows/outflows 14.1 7.6 Expenses relating to environmental provisions – inflows/outflows 3.5 5.2 Core Free Cash Flow (82.0) (54.2) Core Free Cash Flow conversion (Core Free Cash FlowithCore EBITDA) (88.0)% (45.2)%Core Free Cash Flow was €(82.0) million in 2023 versus €(54.2) million in 2022. 2023 Core Free Cash-Flow was notably impacted by:€48.9 million change in trade receivables€(40.4) million change in inventories mainly driven by the impact of inflation and sales phasing.

Ludwig joined EUROAPI on January 2nd  2024  as EVP and Chief Transformation Officer. With over 30 years of experience  notably in companies undergoing transformation  Ludwig will be instrumental to the success of the FOCUS-27 project and the company’s turnaround.Serving as interim CEO since October 2023  Viviane Monges will resume her position as Chair of EUROAPI’s Board and actively oversee the deployment of the transformation project. Elizabeth Bastoni  Chair of the Nominations and Compensation Committee  remains independent lead-Director.FOCUS-27: build on our strengths to refocus on high-value and growing market segments  improve competitiveness  and unlock EUROAPI's sustainable and profitable growth potentialOver the last four months  EUROAPI’s management has carried out a comprehensive analysis of the company’s operational strengths and weaknesses  expected net sales growth  and subsequent financial trajectory.The review confirmed the long-term growth potential of the company as a leading CDMO and API supplier.The merchant API market is expected to deliver a +6% to +8% CAGR between 2024 and 2028  with Tides (+10% CAGR)  HP-APIs (+9.0% CAGR)  and Biochemistry (+6.5% CAGR) leading the growthbetween 2024 and 2028  with Tides (+10% CAGR)  HP-APIs (+9.0% CAGR)  and Biochemistry (+6.5% CAGR) leading the growth EUROAPI has one of the broadest CDMO portfolios   offering a diversified range of technology platforms to its customers  offering a diversified range of technology platforms to its customers EUROAPI benefits from state-of-the-art innovative technologies to better serve its customersOther than Sanofi  EUROAPI has built a broad 500+ customer base  from large Pharma and Biotech to Animal Health  Food  and Cosmetics.To leverage its potential  the company needs to adapt quickly launching FOCUS-27  a comprehensive 4-year project that builds on EUROAPI’s inner strengths to improve competitiveness and unlock sustainable and profitable growth potential.The project is built on 4 pillars:a streamlined value-added API portfolio portfolio  a focused CDMO offer leveraging our recognized capabilities and technology platforms a rationalized industrial footprint  and a leaner organization with more efficient ways of working.Streamlined value-added portfolio - Optimization of EUROAPI’s API portfolio and focus on highly differentiated profitable productsThe strategic review confirmed the potential of several highly differentiated and profitable products  mostly sold to clients other than Sanofi. The commercial strategy will be refocused on these APIs to foster profitable growth  notably:Large molecules  including Peptides and Oligonucleotidesincluding Peptides and Oligonucleotides HP APIs  including Prostaglandins  Corticosteroids and Hormonesincluding Prostaglandins  Corticosteroids and Hormones Vitamin B12 and derivativesand derivatives OpiatesThe decision has been taken to discontinue 13 APIs with low or negative margins  including certain complex small molecules manufactured in Frankfurt and in Brindisi.These undifferentiated molecules represented 8% of 2023 net sales. To take into account EUROAPI's contractual commitments and regulatory constraints  they will be phased out gradually between 2026 and 2027.Focused CDMO offer  leveraging our recognized capabilities and technology platformsThanks to its unique offer  the CDMO business will remain the main driver for growth and profitability  pending adjustments to enhance the organization's responsiveness and agility.The portfolio will be progressively shifted towards more customized and high-value CDMO segments  with a focus on complex small molecules and complex tides.The commercial strategy will be geared towards large biotech and big pharma companies  which accounted for 91% of the RFPs received in 2023. The goal is to increase the average value of the projects and de-risk the pipeline through late-stage projects while strengthening EUROAPIs’ capabilities in HP-APIs  fermentation  and complex tides through value-added and customized offers.Rationalized industrial footprint  prioritizing high-return CAPEXThe rationalization of the industrial footprint will allow for an increase in capacity utilization  with a targeted average utilization rate of 80% to 85%  in line with industry standards.It will impact the Frankfurt site  and two workshops could be mothballed to rightsize the small complex chemistry capacities.In light of the company’s refocused commercial strategy on added-value APIs and the significant decrease in Sanofi’s volumes  the Haverhill and Brindisi sites are considered for divestment. EUROAPI will continue to invest to ensure the required maintenance and compliance CAPEX as well as ongoing CMO activities while working on a potential divestment.Prioritizing high-return projects  EUROAPI will invest between €350 and 400 million CAPEX between 2024 and 2027  with a focus on strategic growth initiatives  including increased capacities for Peptides and Oligonucleotides  Vitamin B12  and Prostaglandins.To foster profitable growth  future CAPEX will be focused on:Dedicated growth investments will strengthen Elbeuf site biochemistry fermentation capabilities  where a steam generation biomass boiler will be built to reduce CO 2 emissions to achieve EUROAPI 2030 decarbonation plansite biochemistry fermentation capabilities  where a steam generation biomass boiler will be built to reduce CO emissions to achieve EUROAPI 2030 decarbonation plan Vertolaye’s multi-production capabilities will be leveraged to boost Corticosteroids and Hormones sales through innovative processes and accelerate the CDMO roadmapmulti-production capabilities will be leveraged to boost sales through innovative processes and The Frankfurt Large Molecules platform to grow the Tides capacitiesIn Budapest  EUROAPI will continue to increase its Prostaglandin capacities.Organizational transformation  and more efficient ways of working12Our organization strives to become more agile and efficient  which includes reducing headcount across all functions. In addition to optimizing its portfolio and rationalizing its industrial footprint  EUROAPI intends to implement a leaner operating model.All functions  including industrial operations  quality  R&D  and support functions  will contribute to the cost savings initiatives  which could lead to headcount reduction across the organization. The project will be presented to EUROAPI’s social partners  local employee representatives  and European Works Council in the coming days  according to legal and social procedures.Under the leadership of Ludwig de Mot  several organizational initiatives have been launched:The organization of the commercial teams will be redesigned to increase synergies and efficiencies  and support future growthThe R&D teams will be reprioritized on innovative platforms and late-stage projects to support the CDMO activityThe transformation of the procurement organization initiated in March 2023 will be accelerated  and a new indirect procurement strategy implementedStrengthened E2E processes will allow to improve supply chain efficiency  increase capacity  drive lead-time and inventory reductions.Revised commercial terms signed with SanofiEUROAPI’s initial mid-term perspectives factored in a low-single-digit regular decline in volumes sold to Sanofi  which were expected to be offset by the ramp-up of the sales to Other Clients.However  the 2024 and 2025 cumulated demand forecasts for API received from Sanofi in early 2024 were significantly below IPO projections. In addition to the volume reduction  higher raw materials and energy prices  which could not be fully reflected in price increases as per the current MSA  weighing on the profitability of our API Solution business.Acknowledging the need for both parties to adapt their commercial relationship to the current environment  Sanofi and EUROAPI have agreed on a series of revisions to the Manufacturing and Supply Agreement signed in October 2021  including:Cancellation of the mutual performance clause 13 . This clause required notably EUROAPI to retrocede to Sanofi a portion of the fixed and variable cost savings realized on APIs sold to Sanofi annually until the end of 2026.

The impairment testing was based on the strategic plan 2024-2027 with an extrapolation period of cash flow estimates.Impairment test resultsThe results of this assessment displayed the following impacts:For France  the impairment of Property  Plant and Equipment amounting €68.3 million is triggered mainly by the change in the discount rate (8.3% in 2023 to be compared to 7.1% in 2022).For Germany (Frankfurt site)  the revised cash flow projections reflecting (i) the restructuring envisaged to stop two workshops will infer material drop in sales due to the discontinuation of certain low margin APIs (e.g. Metamizole) and (ii) the decrease in sales to Sanofi across all APIs triggered an impairment of €51.9 million.For Haverhill  the net impairment is triggered by the sharp decrease of the Sanofi demand for Sevelamer whereas limited additional volumes will come from Other Clients. The amount of PPE and intangible assets impairment reach €57.6 million.For Italy (Brindisi site)  the impairment of €48.6 million is triggered by the discontinuation of certain APIs (e.g. Spiramycin) and expected underactivity on other manufacturing lines while CDMO business will contribute marginally to the site performance.Deferred Tax AssetsAs already disclosed in our 2023 Half-Year financial report  as part of the carve out operation in 2021  Sanofi has transferred the Hungarian business to EUROAPI Hungary. Sanofi has applied for a favorable tax treatment upon this asset transfer  i.e. the deferral of the capital gain taxation. Symmetrically  EUROAPI has maintained the historical value of the assets from a tax perspective. This treatment has been maintained by Sanofi and EUROAPI until the exit from the Sanofi group in May 2022. Upon the filing of their 2022 tax return in May 2023  Sanofi has waived this favorable tax treatment and paid corresponding capital gain tax. As a result and having received from Sanofi necessary confirmations of capital gain tax payment  EUROAPI Hungary has performed a free step-up based on legal restructuring documentation and in the framework of the ownership change. In other words  EUROAPI would amortize tangible assets based on their FMV and would depreciate the goodwill. The step-up of the tax value of the assets results in the recognition of a deferred tax assets in an amount of €42.0 million in addition to the impact of the recurring amortization of the assets for the period.Consolidated Balance Sheet(in € millions) December 31  2023 December 31  2022 Goodwill 4.6 — Property  plant and equipment 468.9 597.1 Right-of-use assets 37.2 42.2 Intangible assets 34.2

UMG's Recorded Music  Music Publishing and Merchandising and Other segments all had strong revenue growth  as discussed further below.EBITDA for the quarter grew 6.6% year-over-year  or 13.3% in constant currency  to €564 million  driven by the revenue growth. EBITDA margin was 17.6%  compared to 18.0% in the fourth quarter of 2022. EBITDA and EBITDA margin were impacted by non-cash share-based compensation expenses of €113 million during the fourth quarter of 2023  and by €91 million of non-cash share-based compensation expenses during the fourth quarter of 2022. Excluding these amounts  Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was €677 million  up 9.2% year-over-year  or 15.1% in constant currency  driven by the revenue growth and €22 million in cash compensation savings associated with our equity plan rollout. Adjusted EBITDA margin remained constant at 21.1% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022.As detailed in the Appendix  EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA were negatively impacted by a €15 million Legal Provision.

This increase was driven by double-digit improvements across all segments  as discussed further below.As detailed in the Appendix  2023 revenue included the benefit of the Copyright Royalty Board Phonorecords III ruling. 2022 revenue included the benefit from the Change in Society Accounting and the Legal Settlement. Excluding these items from both years  full year revenue grew 8.7%  or 12.4% in constant currency.Cost of revenues  consisting of artist and product costs  increased by 7.9% to €6 208 million in 2023 and Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenue increased to 55.9% in 2023 from 55.6% in 2022. Cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues increased due a greater proportion of Music Publishing and Merchandising and Other revenues  which have higher Cost of revenues compared to Recorded Music  and an increase in artist costs as a share of revenue due to Recorded Music repertoire mix.Operating profit declined 11.4%  or 8.3% in constant currency  to €1 418 million in 2023 due to the higher non-cash share-based compensation expenses in 2023 compared to 2022 as discussed below.EBITDA of €1 808 million decreased 10.8% year-over-year  or 7.8% in constant currency  and EBITDA margin was 16.3%  compared to 19.6% in the prior year period. EBITDA and EBITDA margin were impacted by non-cash share-based compensation expenses of €561 million during 2023 compared to €107 million during 2022. Excluding these amounts  Adjusted EBITDA was €2 369 million  up 11.0% in 2023  or 14.6% in constant currency  driven by the revenue growth. Adjusted EBITDA margin improved 0.7pp year-over-year to 21.3%.As detailed in the Appendix  EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in 2023 were impacted by the Copyright Royalty Board Phonorecords III ruling and the Legal Provision while EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in 2022 were impacted by the Change in Society Accounting and the Legal Settlement. Excluding these items  Adjusted EBITDA grew 14.9% year-over-year  or 18.5% in constant currency  and Adjusted EBITDA margin increased 1.2pp year-over-year to 21.5%  compared to 20.3% in 2022  despite a margin headwind from repertoire mix and revenue mix  as discussed above.Net profit attributable to equity holders of the parent for 2023 amounted to €1 259 million compared to €782 million in 2022  resulting in Basic EPS of €0.69 in 2023  compared to €0.43 in 2022  and Diluted EPS of €0.68 in 2023  compared to €0.43 in 2022. The increase in Net profit attributable to equity holders of the parent was due in part to the variance in revaluation of investments in listed companies (including Spotify and Tencent Music Entertainment  among others) that was a net income in 2023 of €425 million compared to a net expense in 2022 of €617 million. Adjusted net profit  which adjusts for the revaluation of investments  non-cash share-based compensation expense  amortization of catalogues and other items detailed in the Appendix  amounted to €1 595 million in 2023  compared to €1 454 million in 2022  resulting in Adjusted Basic EPS of €0.88 in 2023  compared to €0.80 in 2022 and Adjusted Diluted EPS of €0.87 in 2023  compared to €0.80 in 2022. The increase in Adjusted net profit was driven by the growth in Adjusted EBITDA.Net debt  defined as total debt minus cash and cash equivalents  at the end of 2023 was €1 689 million compared to €1 810 million at the end of 2022. The net leverage ratio at year-end 2023  defined as Net debt over EBITDA  was 0.9x  consistent with 0.9x at year-end 2022.Net cash provided by operating activities before income tax paid improved 14.6% to €2 278 million compared to €1 987 million in 2022  despite €132 million paid to settle employee tax liabilities from equity grants on non-cash share-based compensation. The improvement in Net cash provided by operating activities before income tax paid was due to the increase in Adjusted EBITDA  favourable working capital movements and lower royalty advance payments  net of recoupments  which declined 32% to €100 million in 2023 from €148 million in 2022  due to the timing of major artist renewals.The strong Net cash provided by operating activities before income tax paid allowed the Company to continue to strategically invest in the long-term growth of the business. Cash paid for catalogue acquisitions decreased to €178 million in 2023 compared to €359 million in 2022 and included the previously announced acquisitions of catalogues from RS Group in Thailand and Oriental Star Agencies  a British label focused on South Asian music  as well as several artist catalogue deals. Separately  investing activities also included €75 million cash put into escrow for another catalogue acquisition. Other strategic investments in the year included the acquisition of a 50% stake in the entity that owns the iconic Capitol Records building in Hollywood and the acquisitions of a brand services company  a niche record label and UAE-based music company Chabaka  among other items. Free cash flow was largely flat at €1 082 million in 2023 compared to €1 086 million in 2022  even with the increase in investing activities detailed above. Free cash flow also reflects higher income taxes paid and higher net interest paid  both of which benefitted from previously disclosed tax settlements in the prior year.In accordance with UMG's dividend policy to pay a dividend of 50% of Net Profit (subject to agreed non-cash items and applicable law)  UMG has proposed to pay a final dividend of €492 million  or €0.27 per share for the year ended December 31  2023. If approved by shareholders  this would bring UMG's total dividend for 2023 to €929 million  or €0.51 per share. This dividend proposal is subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders.Recorded MusicThree MonthsEndedDecember 31  % %Year ended December 31  % % (in millions of euros) 2023 2022 YoY const.2023 2022 YoY const.(unaudited) (unaudited)(unaudited) (unaudited)Subscriptions and streaming revenue 1 532 1 444 6.1 % 12.4 %5 700 5 321 7.1 % 10.4 % of which streaming 395 400 (1.3 %) 5.6 %1 425 1 420 0.4 % 3.6 % of which subscription 1 137 1 044 8.9 % 15.0 %4 275 3 901 9.6 % 12.8 % Downloads and other digital revenue 32 63 (49.2 %) (45.8 %)207 337 (38.6 %) (35.7 %) Physical revenue 447 404 10.6 % 17.0 %1 380 1 207 14.3 % 19.4 % License and other revenue 410 324 26.5 % 34.0 %1 174 1 072 9.5 % 13.6 % Recorded Music Revenues 2 421 2 235 8.3 % 14.7 %8 461 7 937 6.6 % 10.2 %EBITDA1 618 1 827 (11.4 %) (8.5 %) EBITDA margin19.1 % 23.0 % (3.9pp)Adjusted EBITDA2 042 1 900 7.5 % 11.0 % Adjusted EBITDA margin24.1 % 23.9 % 0.2ppNote: % YoY indicates % change year-over-year; % const. indicates % change year-over-year adjusted for constant currency.Q4 2023Recorded Music revenue for the fourth quarter of 2023 was €2 421 million  up 8.3% compared to the fourth quarter of 2022  or 14.7% in constant currency.

By reimagining our global structure  we are creating a blueprint for a future where our labels are empowered with new capabilities and additional agility  ensuring they can sign and support artists with enhanced access to UMG's highest-performing internal teams and resources.Our organizational redesign achieves efficiencies in targeted cost areas while providing our labels with unprecedented capabilities to deepen artist and fan connections via new experiential  commerce  and content offerings.After a careful review of our cost base for efficiencies  we expect to generate €250m in annual run-rate savings by 2026  all of which is accretive to EBITDA  through a combination of headcount reduction and other operational efficiencies. In the redesign's first phase  which we will execute on immediately  we anticipate achieving €125m in annual run-rate savings  €75m of which will be realized in 2024  with the full amount in 2025.At the same time  UMG's redesign is a carefully crafted balance that preserves the core of where our labels excel – creative A&R and artist-development  marketing and brand building innovation  unique identities and vision  and a shared entrepreneurial spirit. Our long-term growth strategy  including this organizational redesign  represents a new paradigm for artist support and fan engagement.Items Impacting Comparability of ResultsTOTAL UMGFY23 FY22 (in millions of euros) 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 FY23Total 1Q22 2Q22 3Q22 4Q22 FY22Total RevenueLegal Settlement - - - - - - - 71 - 71 Change in Society Accounting - - - - - - 98 - - 98 CRB Phonorecords III Accrual - - 53 - 53 - - - - -Adjusted EBITDALegal Settlement - - - - - - - 52 - 52 Change in Society Accounting - - - - - - 17 - - 17 CRB Phonorecords III Accrual - - 11 - 11 - - - - - Legal Provision - - - (15) (15) - - - - -RECORDED MUSICFY23 FY22 (in millions of euros) 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 FY23Total 1Q22 2Q22 3Q22 4Q22 FY22Total RevenueLegal Settlement - - - - - - - 71 - 71Adjusted EBITDALegal Settlement - - - - - - - 52 - 52 Legal Provision - - - (15) (15) - - - - -MUSIC PUBLISHINGFY23 FY22 (in millions of euros) 1Q23 2Q23 3Q23 4Q23 FY23Total 1Q22 2Q22 3Q22 4Q22 FY22Total RevenueChange in Society Accounting - - - - - - 98 - - 98 CRB Phonorecords III Accrual - - 53 - 53 - - - - -Adjusted EBITDAChange in Society Accounting - - - - - - 17 - - 17 CRB Phonorecords III Accrual - - 11 - 11 - - - - -Change in Society AccountingAs disclosed in UMG's Annual Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31  2021  UMG adjusted its accounting policy in relation to certain revenues that are collected through societies. In prior years  these revenues were recognized when the relevant collection society notified UMG of the usage by the end customer and collectability was assured. Recognition of that revenue  in both 2022 and 2023  was based on an accrual for the best available estimate of when the usage occurs and the amount of consideration which is probable to be collected. This has affected the timing of the recognition of certain revenues across financial reporting quarters compared to periods before 2022 and also  notably in the second quarter of 2022  reflected the receipt of higher income than was accrued at the end of 2021.Legal SettlementRevenue  EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in 2022 included a benefit from the settlement of a copyright infringement lawsuit with an internet service provider previously disclosed and booked in Q3 2022.CRB Phonorecords III AccrualRevenue  EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in 2023 included the accrual for a catch-up payment from certain DSPs related to the Copyright Royalty Board Phonorecords III ruling in 2023 disclosed and booked in Q3 2023.Legal ProvisionEBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in Q4 2023 were negatively impacted by a provision reflected in relation to a decades-old  ongoing artist estate litigation in Latin America.Conference Call DetailsThe Company will host a conference call to discuss these results on Wednesday  February 28  2024 at 6:15PM CET.

These non-IFRS measures (also known as alternative performance indicators) are presented because management considers them important supplemental measures of UMG's performance and believes that they are widely used in the industry in which UMG operates as a means of evaluating a company's operating performance and liquidity. UMG believes that an understanding of its sales performance  profitability  financial strength and funding requirements is enhanced by reporting the following non-IFRS measures. All non-IFRS measures should be considered in addition to  and not as a substitute for  other IFRS measures of operating and financial performance as presented in UMG's Consolidated Financial Statements and the related Notes  or as described in this press release. In addition  it should be noted that other companies may have definitions and calculations for these non-IFRS measures that differ from those used by UMG  thereby affecting comparability.EBITDA and EBITDA marginUMG considers EBITDA and EBITDA margin  non-IFRS measures  to be relevant measures to assess its operating performance and the performance of its operating segments as reported in the segment data. It enables UMG to compare the operating performance of operating segments regardless of whether their performance is driven by the operating segment's organic growth or by acquisitions. It excludes restructuring expenses  which may impact period-to-period comparability. EBITDA margin is EBITDA divided by revenue. To calculate EBITDA  the accounting impact of the following items is excluded from the Operating Profit:i. amortization of intangible assets;ii. impairment on goodwill and other intangibles;iii. depreciation of tangible assets including right of use assets;iv. (gains)/losses on the sale of tangible assets  included right of use assets and intangible assets; andv. restructuring expenses.Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA marginThe difference between EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA consists of non-cash share-based compensation expenses and certain one-time items that are deemed by management to be significant and incidental to normal business activity. Adjusted EBITDA margin is Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue. UMG considers Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin  non-IFRS measures  to be relevant measures to assess performance of its operating activities excluding items that may be incidental to normal business activity and excluding non-cash share based compensation which may impact period-to-period comparability.Adjusted Net Profit/Adjusted Net Profit per shareUMG's use of Adjusted net profit is appropriate as UMG uses it as the basis for the Adjusted net profit per share (in EUR) – diluted  both of which are non-IFRS measures. Adjusted net profit may be subject to limitations as an analytical tool for investors  as it excludes certain items and therefore does not reflect the expense associated with such items  which may be significant and have a significant effect on UMG's net profit. The accounting impact of the following items are excluded from Net profit attributable to equity holders of the parent:i. amortization of catalogues;ii. impairment of goodwill and intangible assets;iii. financial income and expenses  excluding interest and income from investments;iv. earnings from discontinued operations;v. non-cash share-based compensation expense;vi. certain one-time items that are deemed by management to be significant and incidental to normal business activity;vii. income tax impact on the above adjustments;viii. non-recurring tax items; andix. adjustments attributable to non-controlling interests.Financial Net DebtUMG considers Financial Net Debt  a non-IFRS measure  to be a relevant indicator of its liquidity and capital resources. UMG management uses this indicator for reporting  management and planning purposes. Financial Net Debt is calculated as the sum of:i. cash and cash equivalents  as reported in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position  including (i) cash in banks and deposits  whether or not compensated  corresponding to cash  and (ii) money market funds;ii. cash management financial assets  included in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position under ""financial assets""  relating to financial investments  which do not satisfy the criteria for classification as cash equivalents set forth in IAS 7; andiii. derivative financial instruments  net (assets and liabilities) where the underlying instruments are Financial Net Debt items  as well as cash deposits securing borrowings included in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position under ""financial assets""; less:i. the value of borrowings at amortized cost as reported in the Consolidated Statement of Financial PositionFree Cash FlowUMG defines Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by/(used for) operating activities plus net cash provided by/(used for) investing activities  less repayment of lease liabilities  interest paid  net and other cash items related to financing activities. UMG considers Free Cash Flow  a non-IFRS measure  to be a relevant indicator of its cash flow generated to fund dividend payments and repayment of debt. Free Cash Flow is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with IFRS and therefore it should not be considered in isolation of  or as a substitute for cash flow provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity. Free Cash Flow  as we calculate it  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. In addition  Free Cash Flow does not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use and is not necessarily a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs.Logo - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/512308/UMG.jpg",neutral,0.04,0.96,0.01,positive,0.68,0.31,0.01,True,English,"['Universal Music Group N.V.', 'Financial Results', 'Fourth Quarter', 'Full Year', 'UAE artist services business Chabaka', 'Universal Music Group N.V.', 'International Accounting Standards Board', 'International Financial Reporting Standards', 'IFPI Global Recording Artist', 'first artist-centric royalty models', 'Recorded Music subscription revenue', 'Global artist success', 'innovative business models', 'high-growth music markets', 'Summary Q4 2023 Results1', 'The Rolling Stones', 'alternative performance indicators', 'Summary FY 2023 Results1', 'Strategic Organizational Redesign', 'annual run-rate savings', 'Oriental Star Agency', 'South Asian repertoire', 'U.S. Congress', 'creative community interests', ""songwriters' record-breaking performance"", 'Sir Lucian Grainge', 'final dividend proposal', '€15 million one-time item', 'First music company', 'Adjusted EBITDA margin', 'AI content development', 'Responsible AI Initiatives', 'other operational efficiencies', 'Top 10 global artists', '2023 Business Highlights', 'RS Group', 'financial results', 'Apple Music', 'First phase', 'total dividend', 'low-value content', 'innovative partnerships', 'streaming revenue', 'one-time items', 'other items', 'responsible practices', 'constant currency', 'strong growth', 'Taylor Swift', 'Jung Kook', 'Stray Kids', 'press release', 'Net cash', 'operating activities', 'income tax', 'shareholder approval', 'headcount reduction', 'cost areas', 'labels capabilities', 'fan connections', 'Initial deals', 'DSP platforms', 'catalogue acquisitions', 'British label', 'federal right', 'unethical uses', 'early-stage entrepreneurs', 'key principles', 'fourth quarter', 'next wave', 'growth opportunities', 'Boyd Muir', 'Top sellers', 'historic partnership', 'long-term strategy', 'thoughtful investment', 'IFRS measures', 'Year chart', 'full year', 'exceptional year', 'Top 20', 'segments', 'headwind', 'Drake', 'descriptions', 'reconciliations', 'Appendix', 'combination', 'Plan', 'targeted', 'Spotify', 'songs', 'Implementation', 'Deezer', 'fans', 'fraud', 'gaming', 'amount', 'Progress', 'Thailand', 'publicity', 'deepfakes', 'YouTube', 'HILVERSUM', 'Netherlands', 'Feb.', 'UMG', 'work', 'industry', 'leadership', 'behalf', 'employees', 'shareholders', 'Chairman', 'CEO', 'EVP', 'CFO', 'President', 'Operations']",2024-02-28,2024-02-29,prnewswire.co.uk

Inflation in Argentina has accelerated  resulting in a more significant impact on the organic revenue growth of AB InBev than historically. For illustrative purposes  fully excluding the Argentinean operation  the 4Q23 organic revenue increase for AB InBev would be 0.5% versus the 6.2% reported. For FY23  revenue growth for AB InBev would be 3.8% versus the 7.8% reported.Consolidated other operating income/(expenses) in FY23 increased by 19.8% primarily driven by higher government grants. In FY23  Ambev recognized 44 million USD income in other operating income related to tax credits (FY22: 201 million USD). The year-over-year change is presented as a scope change and does not affect the presented organic growth rates.Non-underlying items above EBIT & Non-underlying share of results of associatesFigure 4.

Normalized EBITDA and normalized EBIT do not have a standard calculation method and AB InBev’s definition of normalized EBITDA and normalized EBIT may not be comparable to that of other companies.Argentinean Peso devaluationIn December 2023  the Argentinean Peso underwent a significant devaluation with the USDARS exchange rate closing at 809 on 31 December 2023 compared to 350 on 30 September 2023. IFRS (IAS 29) require us to restate the year-to-date results for the change in the general purchasing power of the local currency  using official indices before converting the local amounts at the closing rate of the period (i.e. FY23 and FY22 results at the closing rate on 31 December 2023 and 2022  respectively). The December 2023 devaluation negatively impacted our revenue and Normalized EBITDA as reported in 4Q23 and FY23. The impact of hyperinflation accounting in 4Q22 and 4Q23  as well as FY22 and FY23 were as follows:Impact of hyperinflation (million USD) Revenue 4Q22 4Q23 FY22 FY23 Indexing (1) 161 156 483 561 Currency (2) -268 -855 -578 -1 279 Total impact -107 -699 -95 -717 Normalized EBITDA 4Q22 4Q23 FY22 FY23 Indexing (1) 41 83 150 211 Currency (2) -107 -356 -209 -525 Total impact -66 -274 -59 -314 USDARS average rate 128 294 USDARS closing rate 177 809(1) Indexation calculated at closing rate (2) Currency impact from hyperinflation calculated as the difference between converting the Argentinean peso (ARS) reported amounts at the closing exchange rate compared to the average exchange rate of each periodFinancial positionFigure 13.

Net increase/(decrease) in cash and cash equivalents -1 942 315FY23 recorded an increase in cash and cash equivalents of 315 million USD compared to a decrease of 1 942 million USD in FY22  with the following movements:Our cash flow from operating activities reached 13 265 million USD in FY23 compared to 13 298 million USD in FY22. The decrease was driven by changes in working capital for FY23 compared to FY22 as a result of (i) higher trade and other receivables due partially to increased sales in December 2023 versus December 2022 and extended credit terms to our wholesalers in the US  and (ii) a decrease in trade and other payables due to lower inventory purchases and net capex  and US volume performance.Our cash outflow from investing activities was 4 354 million USD in FY23 compared to a cash outflow of 4 620 million USD in FY22. The decrease in the cash outflow from investing activities was mainly due to lower net capital expenditures in FY23 compared to FY22. Out of the total FY23 capital expenditures  approximately 40% was used to improve the company’s production facilities while 44% was used for logistics and commercial investments and 16% was used for improving administrative capabilities and for the purchase of hardware and software.Our cash outflow from financing activities amounted to 8 596 million USD in FY23  as compared to a cash outflow of 10 620 million USD in FY22. The decrease is primarily driven by lower debt redemption in FY23 compared to FY22.Our net debt decreased to 67.6 billion USD as of 31 December 2023 from 69.7 billion USD as of 31 December 2022.Our net debt to normalized EBITDA ratio was 3.38x as of 31 December 2023. Our optimal capital structure is a net debt to normalized EBITDA ratio of around 2x.We continue to proactively manage our debt portfolio. After redemptions in December 2023 of 3 billion USD  98% of our bond portfolio holds a fixed-interest rate  41% is denominated in currencies other than USD and maturities are well-distributed across the next several years.In addition to a very comfortable debt maturity profile and strong cash flow generation  as of 31 December 2023  we had total liquidity of 20.5 billion USD  which consisted of 10.1 billion USD available under committed long-term credit facilities and 10.4 billion USD of cash  cash equivalents and short-term investments in debt securities less bank overdrafts.2024 presentation updateFor FY24  the definition of organic revenue growth has been amended to cap the price growth in Argentina to a maximum of 2% per month. Corresponding adjustments will be made to all income statement related items in the organic growth calculations.Proposed full year 2023 dividendThe AB InBev Board proposes a full year 2023 dividend of 0.82 EUR per share  subject to shareholder approval at the AGM on 24 April 2024. In line with the Company’s financial discipline and deleveraging objectives  the recommended dividend balances the Company’s capital allocation priorities and dividend policy while returning cash to shareholders. A timeline showing the ex-dividend  record and payment dates can be found below:Dividend Timeline Ex-dividend date Record Date Payment date Euronext 3 May 2024 6 May 2024 7 May 2024 MEXBOL 3 May 2024 6 May 2024 7 May 2024 JSE 2 May 2024 6 May 2024 7 May 2024 NYSE (ADR program) 3 May 2024 6 May 2024 7 June 2024 Restricted Shares 3 May 2024 6 May 2024 7 May 2024NotesTo facilitate the understanding of AB InBev’s underlying performance  the analyses of growth  including all comments in this press release  unless otherwise indicated  are based on organic growth and normalized numbers. In other words  financials are analyzed eliminating the impact of changes in currencies on translation of foreign operations  and scope changes. Scope changes represent the impact of acquisitions and divestitures  the start or termination of activities or the transfer of activities between segments  curtailment gains and losses and year over year changes in accounting estimates and other assumptions that management does not consider as part of the underlying performance of the business. The organic growth of our global brands  Budweiser  Stella Artois  Corona and Michelob Ultra  excludes exports to Australia for which a perpetual license was granted to a third party upon disposal of the Australia operations in 2020. All references per hectoliter (per hl) exclude US non-beer activities. Whenever presented in this document  all performance measures (EBITDA  EBIT  profit  tax rate  EPS) are presented on a “normalized” basis  which means they are presented before non-underlying items. Non-underlying items are either income or expenses which do not occur regularly as part of the normal activities of the Company. They are presented separately because they are important for the understanding of the underlying sustainable performance of the Company due to their size or nature. Normalized measures are additional measures used by management and should not replace the measures determined in accordance with IFRS as an indicator of the Company’s performance. As from 1 January 2023  mark-to-market gains/(losses) on derivatives related to the hedging of our share-based payment programs are reported in the non-underlying net finance income/(cost). The 2022 presentation was amended to conform to the 2023 presentation. We are reporting the results from Argentina applying hyperinflation accounting since 3Q18. The IFRS rules (IAS 29) require us to restate the year-to-date results for the change in the general purchasing power of the local currency  using official indices before converting the local amounts at the closing rate of the period. These impacts are excluded from organic calculations. In FY23  we reported a negative impact on the profit attributable to equity holders of AB InBev of 203 million USD. The impact in FY23 Basic EPS was -0.10 USD. Values in the figures and annexes may not add up  due to rounding. 4Q23 and FY23 EPS is based upon a weighted average of 2 016 million shares compared to a weighted average of 2 013 million shares for 4Q22 and FY22.Legal disclaimerThis release contains “forward-looking statements”.

(""CoolCo"" or the ""Company"") (NYSE:CLCO / CLCO.OL).Q4 Highlights and Subsequent EventsGenerated total operating revenues of $97.1 million in Q4  compared to $92.9 million for the third quarter of 2023 (""Q3"" or ""Q3 2023"");Net income of $22.4 1 million in Q4  compared to $39.2 1 million for Q3  with the decrease primarily related to unrealized mark-to-market losses on our interest rate swaps;million in Q4  compared to $39.2 million for Q3  with the decrease primarily related to unrealized mark-to-market losses on our interest rate swaps; Achieved average Time Charter Equivalent Earnings (""TCE"") 2 of $87 300 per day for Q4  compared to $82 400 per day for Q3;of $87 300 per day for Q4  compared to $82 400 per day for Q3; Generated Adjusted EBITDA 2 of $69.4 million for Q4  compared to $62.8 million for Q3;of $69.4 million for Q4  compared to $62.8 million for Q3; During the Quarter  the Company announced that it had entered into sale and leaseback financing arrangements (the “Sale and Leasebacks”) with Huaxia Financial Leasing Co. Ltd for the two state-of-the-art MEGA LNG carriers under order at Hyundai-Samho (the ""Newbuilds"");Subsequent to the Quarter  the Company received commitments from certain banks to upsize (on a delayed draw-down basis) the existing $520 million term loan facility maturing in May 2029 in anticipation of the maturity of the two sale & leaseback facilities during the first quarter of 2025;Announced a twelve-month charter  which is scheduled to commence during the first quarter of 2024.Declared a dividend for Q4 of $0.41 per share  to be paid to shareholders of record on March 11  2024.Richard Tyrrell  CEO  commented:“In the fourth quarter  we benefited from strong operational performance  a seasonal uplift on our variable rate contract  and the continuing impact of our fleet’s fixed-rate charter coverage. Additionally  we took measured exposure to the charter market in the form of one vessel that we chose to deploy directly in the spot market while waiting for the right term opportunity. The net result was a sequentially higher TCE level at $87 300 per day  CoolCo's highest ever quarterly TCE.This winter saw rates return to more normalized levels after an extraordinary period following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Despite the normalization of the overall market  CoolCo benefited from having a number of medium and long-term charters at previously contracted higher levels and continued to show its ability to secure high value business with the announcement of a 12-month charter for its spot market vessel  to commence during the first quarter of 2024. Our next available vessels are well spaced and do not come open before the second half of 2024  when the market is anticipated to be in a seasonal upswing powered by expected longer voyage distances as greater volumes of LNG head east this year.Due to the relatively warm northern hemisphere winter  gas prices have fallen and reduced the option value to charterers of maintaining excess LNG carrier capacity to facilitate opportunistic trades. This  combined with some delays to certain liquefaction projects  has resulted in sublets weighing on time charter rates. Nonetheless  CoolCo’s Newbuilds continue to attract interest and remain the only such vessels in the market available from independent owners in 2024  and thus the only such vessels likely to be available for term contracts. With the imposition of increasingly tight emissions regulations in the coming years  the relative advantage of these state-of-the-art vessels only increases over time. Conversely  older steam turbine vessels  which presently make up 31% of the global fleet (by number of vessels) face growing pressure from those same regulations and their utilization is falling to the point that  heavy scrapping in the coming years is anticipated.CoolCo has a backlog of $1.4 billion of contracted revenue at the end of the Quarter and continues to expect near-term earnings growth from its fully financed Newbuilds  when delivered  to offset current market weakness should it persist.""Financial HighlightsThe table below sets forth certain key financial information for Q4 2023  Q3 2023  Q4 2022  FY 2023 and December 31  2022 (""FY 2022"")  split between Successor and Predecessor periods  as defined below.Twelve Months ended December 31  Q4 2023 Q3 2023 Q4 2022 2023 2022 (in thousands of $  except TCE) Successor Successor Successor Successor Successor Predecessor Total Time and voyage charter revenues 89 319 84 523 79 032 347 081 183 567 37 289 220 856 Total operating revenues 97 144 92 901 90 255 379 010 212 978 43 456 256 434 Operating income 55 051 48 336 48 881 200 893 110 936 27 728 138 664 Net income 1 22 415 39 170 33 069 176 363 87 500 23 244 110 744 Adjusted EBITDA2 69 432 62 754 58 621 259 894 134 585 33 473 168 058 Average daily TCE2 (to the closest $100) 87 300 82 400 83 600 83 600 73 000 57 100 69 800Note: As disclosed previously  the commencement of operations and funding of CoolCo and the acquisition of its initial tri-fuel diesel electric (""TFDE"") LNG carriers  The Cool Pool Limited and the shipping and FSRU management organization from Golar LNG Limited (""Golar"") were completed in a phased process. It commenced with the funding of CoolCo on January 27  2022 and concluded with the acquisition of the LNG carrier and FSRU management organization on June 30  2022  with vessel acquisitions taking place on different dates over that period. Results for the twelve months that commenced January 1  2022 and ended December 31  2022 have therefore been split between the period prior to the funding of CoolCo and various phased acquisitions of vessel and management entities (the ""Predecessor"" period) and the period subsequent to the various phased acquisitions (the ""Successor"" period). The combined results are not in accordance with U.S. GAAP and consist of the aggregate of selected financial data of the Successor and Predecessor periods. No other adjustments have been made to the combined presentation. We cannot adequately benchmark the operating results for the year ended December 31  2023 against the previous year reported in our comparative unaudited financial information without combining the applicable Successor and Predecessor periods and do not believe that reviewing the results of the periods in isolation would be useful in identifying trends in or reaching conclusions regarding our overall operating performance.LNG Market ReviewThe average Japan/Korea Marker gas price (""JKM"") for the Quarter was $13.35/MMBtu compared to $11.81/MMBtu for Q3 2023; with average JKM for Q1 2024 at $13.84/MMBtu as of February 23  2024. The Quarter commenced with Dutch Title Transfer Facility gas price (""TTF"") at $12.54/MMBtu and quoted TFDE headline spot rates of $188 750 per day. The Quarter concluded with TTF at $10.31/MMBtu and quoted TFDE headline spot rates of $78 750 per day. The TFDE headline spot rate has subsequently fallen to as low as $40 000 per day  but with a very low volume of transactions taking place at those levels.Because trading opportunities that rely on LNG carriers for floating storage were limited and periods of West-East arbitrage did not materialize  the pre-winter seasonal spike that began in late September quickly normalized  as has been seen in prior years when similar trading conditions prevailed. LNG was generally traded within its basin of origin  which reduced the number of long-distance inter-basin voyages. While those inter-basin voyages that did take place during the Quarter were extended by limitations on Panama Canal traffic and the more recent threat of attacks in the Red Sea causing vessels to route around the Cape of Good Hope  the limited number of such voyages during the winter 2023/24 has meant that their effect on prevailing rates has not been material.The high level of LNG prices in the first half of the year and expectation that these would persist resulted in coal being stockpiled for the current winter. Today’s lower actual prices and the environmental benefits of transitioning from coal-to-gas are likely to make LNG an increasingly attractive alternative going forward  particularly in markets such as China  India  and South-East Asia which have typically been more price-sensitive and involve relatively greater shipping distances.Operational ReviewCoolCo's fleet continued to perform well with a Q4 fleet utilization of 97% (Q3: 97%) with the remaining 3% covered by a ballast bonus  compared to 100% for the first half of 2023. While there were no drydocks in 2023  four drydocks are expected during 2024  starting with one in the second quarter and the remaining three during the third quarter. The budgeted cost of these dry-docks is approximately $6.5 million each plus up to 30 days off-hire. One of the drydocks in the third quarter will involve the upgrade of a vessel to LNGe specification through the addition of a subcooler with high liquefaction capacity and other performance enhancements at a budgeted cost of an additional $15.0 million and an additional 20 days off-hire.Subsequent to the Quarter  a ship management services customer has decided to transfer an additional two vessels for which CoolCo currently provides technical management to managers that solely provide ship management services. This is not expected to materially impact CoolCo's earnings and we expect to incur some immaterial restructuring costs to adjust our operations in light of this change.Business DevelopmentSubsequent to the end of the Quarter  the Company announced that it has entered into a new time charter agreement for one of its TFDE vessels. The 12-month time charter is with Santos Singapore Shipping Pte. Ltd. and is scheduled to commence in the first quarter of 2024. The vessel is scheduled to be upgraded to LNGe specification in the third quarter of 2024 and the charter includes an innovative commercial mechanism to reward both the charterer and CoolCo for realizing performance and environmental gains as a result of the upgrades.CoolCo continues to be in discussions with multiple potential charterers seeking employment for the two Newbuilds it has on order for delivery towards the end of second half of 2024. While headline LNG carrier rates and recent negative sentiment in the sector have served as a headwind to securing long-term employment at attractive rates  several charterers are known to have specific and as-yet-unmet transportation requirements and are expected to come to market in advance of the 2024 winter season and delivery of the Newbuilds.Financing and LiquidityIn October 2023  the Company announced that it had entered into Sale and Leasebacks for the Newbuilds with Huaxia Financial Leasing Co. Ltd. The Sale and Leasebacks are on a fixed rate per day basis for 10 years  with extension options  an implied fixed interest rate just under 6% and a minimum loan-to-value of 80%  with potential for additional capacity contingent upon the terms of the charter employment that the Company anticipates securing in advance of the Newbuilds' deliveries. The Sale and Leaseback financing also offers pre-delivery financing of the Newbuilds.Subsequent to the Quarter  the Company received commitments from certain banks to upsize the existing $520 million term loan facility maturing in May 2029 in anticipation of the need to refinance the maturity of the two existing sale & leaseback facilities during the first quarter of 2025. The upsize will be on a delayed drawdown basis (at our option) to benefit from the current low interest rate in these existing facilities.As of December 31  2023  CoolCo had cash and cash equivalents of $133.5 million and total short and long-term debt  net of deferred finance charges  amounted to $1 061.1 million. Total Contractual Debt2 stood at $1 163.9 million  which comprised of $485.3 million in respect of the $570 million bank facility maturing in March 2027  $461.9 million in respect of the $520 million term loan facility  maturing in May 2029  and $216.7 million of sale and leaseback facilities which comprised of $176.7 million in respect of the two maturing in the first quarter of 2025 (Kool Ice and Kool Kelvin) and $40 million in respect of the Newbuilds financing (Kool Tiger & Kool Panther).Overall  the Company’s interest rate on its debt is fixed or hedged for approximately 85% of the notional amount of debt  adjusting for existing cash on hand.Corporate and Other MattersAs of December 31  2023  CoolCo had 53 702 846 shares issued and outstanding. Of these  31 254 390 shares (58.2%) were owned by EPS Ventures Ltd (""EPS"") and 22 448 456 (41.8%) were publicly owned.In line with the Company’s variable dividend policy  the Board has declared a Q4 dividend of $0.41 per common share. The record date is March 11  2024 and the dividend will be distributed to DTC-registered shareholders on or around March 18  2024  while due to the implementation of the Central Securities Depositories Regulation in Norway  the dividend will be distributed to Euronext VPS-registered shareholders on or around March 21  2024.OutlookIn the coming years  the global supply of LNG is set to increase by more than 50% based on projects that have already reached Final Investment Decision (""FID""). At least 40 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of capacity have reached FID stage in 2023 alone  equivalent to approximately 10% of total LNG production in 2022. To understand the current 51% orderbook-to-fleet ratio (by volume)  it is critical to recognize that the orderbook has overwhelmingly been built based on long-term contracts to service new liquefaction facilities. The timing and quantity of these vessels deliveries are intended to match the commencement of new production. Furthermore  to the extent that project development delays result in vessels delivering to their charterers before their intended startup time  we would expect to see a dynamic similar to that which has recently prevailed. In such a scenario  the market is sharply divided between charterers seeking to fill interim periods in the spot market and owners such as CoolCo  who are in a position to offer multi-year time charters. Numerous liquefaction projects are still under development in North America  the Middle East  and various other geographies. This supply is expected to meet gas demand arising from the continued strong and widespread desire to decarbonize both through complementing renewables with gas  and gas substituting for the vast amounts of coal still being consumed.Among LNG carriers currently on the water  the older  less efficient vessels in the charter market are expected to face growing competitive pressure over time  particularly among the steam turbine vessels that continue to make up over 30% of the global fleet by volume. The imposition of the International Maritime Organization's (IMO) carbon intensity indicator (CII) rules from the beginning of last year  as well as this year's implementation of carbon pricing on voyages into Europe  are projected to increase the relative advantage of modern  efficient TFDE and 2-stroke tonnage  such as those in the CoolCo fleet.The limited supply of modern vessels available for time charter employment through the medium-term is concentrated among a small number of owners  including CoolCo. Given the improved bargaining position afforded by a combination of scarcity and concentration  such owners have remained focused primarily on longer-term charters that would bridge the period from now until the next wave of LNG supply is expected to arrive in 2026-2027. A newbuild vessel ordered today would have a lead time of approximately four years  a purchase price exceeding $260 million and relatively expensive financing  limiting the likelihood of unforeseen newbuild tonnage during that period while providing support for the rate benchmark against which the overall fleet is priced.1 Net income includes mark-to market loss on interest rate swaps amounting to $13.1 million for Q4 2023  compared to gains of $9.7 million for Q3 2023 and $7.3 million for year ended December 31  2023. 2 Refer to 'Appendix A' - Non-GAAP financial measures and definitions  for definitions of these measures and a reconciliation to the nearest GAAP measure.FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTSThis press release and any other written or oral statements made by us in connection with this press release include forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

On January 26  2022  CoolCo entered into various agreements (the ""Vessel SPA"") with Golar  as amended on February 25  2022  pursuant to which CoolCo acquired all of the outstanding shares of nine of Golar’s wholly-owned subsidiaries on various dates in March and April 2022. Eight of these entities were each the registered or disponent owner or lessee of the following modern LNG carriers: Crystal  Ice  Bear  Frost  Glacier  Snow  Kelvin and Seal (disposed subsequently). The Cool Pool Limited was the entity responsible for the marketing of these LNG carriers. For CoolCo  for the three and twelve month periods ended December 31  2022  the successor period reflects the period beginning from January 27  2022 with the closing of CoolCo’s Norwegian equity raise and the date CoolCo operations substantially commenced and were considered meaningful. Vessel SPA acquisition dates were staggered reflecting results  as the successor  from the date CoolCo obtained control of the respective vessel entities. (2) Predecessor period includes results derived from the carve-out of historical operations from Golar entities acquired by CoolCo as part of the Vessel SPA and ManCo SPA until the day before the

BusinessIn addition to disclosing financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (US GAAP)  this earnings release and the associated investor presentation and discussion contain references to the non-GAAP financial measures which are included in the table below. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business  enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance  and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business and measuring our performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for  or superior to  financial measures calculated in accordance with US GAAP  and the financial results calculated in accordance with US GAAP. Non-GAAP measures are not uniformly defined by all companies  and may not be comparable with similar titles  measures and disclosures used by other companies. The reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated.Non-GAAP measure Closest equivalent US GAAP measure Adjustments to reconcile to primary financial statements prepared under US GAAP Rationale for adjustments Performance Measures Adjusted EBITDA Net income '+/- Other non-operating income +/- Net financial expense  representing: Interest income  Interest expense  Gains/(Losses) on derivative instruments and Other financial items  net +/- Income taxes  net + Depreciation and amortization - Amortization of intangible assets and liabilities – charter agreements  net Increases the comparability of total business performance from period to period and against the performance of other companies by removing the impact of other non-operating income  depreciation  amortization of intangible assets and liabilities -charter agreements  net  financing and tax items. Average daily TCE Time and voyage charter revenues - Voyage  charter hire and commission expenses  net The above total is then divided by calendar days less scheduled off-hire days. - Measure of the average daily net revenue performance of a vessel. - Standard shipping industry performance measure used primarily to compare period-to-period changes in the vessel’s net revenue performance despite changes in the mix of charter types (i.e. spot charters  time charters and bareboat charters) under which the vessel may be employed between the periods. - Assists management in making decisions regarding the deployment and utilization of its fleet and in evaluating financial performance. Liquidity measures Total Contractual Debt Total debt (current and non-current)  net of deferred finance charges + VIE Consolidation and fair value adjustments upon acquisition + Deferred Finance Charges We consolidate two lessor VIEs for our sale and leaseback facilities (for the vessels Ice and Kelvin). This means that on consolidation  our contractual debt is eliminated and replaced with the Lessor VIEs’ debt. Contractual debt represents our actual debt obligations under our various financing arrangements before consolidating the Lessor VIEs. The measure enables investors and users of our financial statements to assess our liquidity and the split of our debt (current and non-current) based on our underlying contractual obligations. Total Company Cash CoolCo cash based on GAAP measures: + Cash and cash equivalents + Restricted cash and short-term deposits (current and non-current) - VIE restricted cash and short-term deposits (current and non-current) We consolidate lessor VIEs for our sale and leaseback facilities.

The price range was set between €9 and €11  giving a market capitalisation of €2.67bn.The IPO has had a lasting effect on Lottomatica’s earnings. In its third quarter 2023 results  it reported €2.8bn in gross gambling revenue (GGR).During November  Lottomatica acquired SKS365 Malta  which had an enterprise value of €639m at the time. In the same month  Lottomatica announced that it would issue and sell €500.0m in notes to help fund the acquisition. The deal with Lottomatica proved to be the nail in the coffin for Playtech  which had previously opened talks to acquire SKS365.Guglielmo Angelozzi  CEO of Lottomatica  said the year had seen the company grow on all business fronts – including the IPO.“2023 marked a very strong year for our group  in which we consolidated our leadership position across all segments and brands ” said Angelozzi. “We exceeded expectations set at IPO and subsequent upgrades  with revenues of €1 632 million and adjusted EBITDA of €596 million at normalised payout.”“We continued to grow both organically  increasing market share for the fifth quarter in a row and  through M&A  signing the acquisition of SKS365 and executing our bolt-on strategy.”Online segment and bets stand out for LottomaticaThe full-year revenue was up 12.0% on a pro-forma basis.

But the company’s gaming segment outperformed in terms of revenue  bringing in €743.4m. This represented a rise of 2.4%. Lottomatica’s sports franchise segment generated €368.2m.A total of €30.1bn was generated in bets  up 17.9% pro-forma. More than half of this – €16.20bn – came from Lottomatica’s online segment. Its gaming segment made up €11.10bn of the total  while the sports franchise segment made up the remaining €2.82bn.Lottamatica GGR for the year was €3.86bn  up by 6.0%. Total online market share stood at 21.7% in Q4  while online sports market share was 22.1% during the quarter. Online gaming market share was 21.5% in Q4.adjusted ebitda for 2023 was at €580.4m – up by 16.6% on a pro-forma basis.Full-year break down and 2024 guidanceOther income for Lottomatica amounted to €18.5m for the year  bringing the total revenues and income to €1.65bn. Looking at costs and expenses  cost of services delivered the largest blow here  rising 10.6% to €972.7m. Finance expenses topped €220.2m  while depreciation  amortisation and impairments hit €194.1m.The overall costs brought the profit before tax to €137.6m  a 3.2% improvement year-on-year. Following €63.4m in income tax expense  the net profit for the year totalled at €74.2m  down from €78.4m.Adjusted EBITDA for 2023 was €580.4m. This was up by 16.6% on a pro-forma basis.For Lottomatica’s 2024 full-year projections  it noted that it expects revenue between €1.80bn-€1.84bn. Adjusted EBITDA is projected to be between €625m-€645m  with an estimated 53.0% generated by the online segment.Updated guidance is set to be released after the SKS365 acquisition has closed.

The designation is reserved for novel  cutting-edge therapies addressing an unmet need and provides many potential regulatory and reimbursement advantages.,EINDHOVEN  the Netherlands  Feb. 29  2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ONWARD Medical N.V. (Euronext: ONWD)  the medical technology company creating innovative spinal cord stimulation therapies to restore movement  function  and independence in people with spinal cord injury (SCI)  today announces it has been awarded Breakthrough Device Designation (BDD) by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the ARC-BCI System  which uses brain-computer interface (BCI) technology in conjunction with its ARC-IM® Therapy to restore thought-driven lower limb mobility after spinal cord injury (SCI). This BDD is supported by clinical data from two feasibility studies.This is the tenth FDA BDD awarded to ONWARD Medical. The designation is reserved for novel  cutting-edge therapies addressing an unmet need and provides many potential regulatory and reimbursement advantages. This latest award gives ONWARD Medical priority FDA review  the opportunity to interact with FDA experts throughout the pre-market regulatory review phase  and the potential to seek additional reimbursement for its ARC-BCI System.“Brain-computer interface technology unlocks the transformative potential to enhance ARC-IM with thought-driven control of movement after paralysis ” said ONWARD Medical CEO Dave Marver. “We look forward to learning more about the potential for this combination of ARC Therapy™ and a BCI to help people with spinal cord injury live more independently. We are also grateful to the FDA for recognizing our innovations and their potential to help people with profound unmet needs.”An implanted BCI records brain activity  capturing signals that indicate a person’s intention to move. The ARC-BCI System then uses artificial intelligence (AI) to decode those signals and translate them into specific instructions for the ARC-IM System  which converts the instructions into precise stimulation of the injured spinal cord. ARC-BCI creates a “digital bridge ” restoring communication between the brain and the body  enabling thought-driven movement after paralysis.In 2021  a BCI was paired with ARC-IM Therapy for the first time in history to restore movement of the lower limbs  including walking  after SCI. In May 2023  Nature published the results of this groundbreaking feasibility study  highlighting the study participant’s augmented control over his paralyzed legs with the addition of a BCI. ONWARD Medical was previously granted nine BDDs for multiple indications for its ARC Therapy platforms  including mobility and blood pressure regulation. The Company plans to launch its first product later this year.All ONWARD Medical devices and therapies  including but not limited to ARC-IM®  ARC-EX®  and ARC Therapy™  alone or in combination with a brain-computer interface (BCI)  are investigational and not available for commercial use.About ONWARD MedicalONWARD® Medical is a medical technology company creating therapies to restore movement  function  and independence in people with spinal cord injury (SCI) and movement disabilities. Building on more than a decade of science and preclinical research conducted at leading neuroscience laboratories  the Company has received ten Breakthrough Device Designations from the US Food and Drug Administration for its ARC Therapy™ platform.ONWARD® ARC Therapy  which can be delivered by external ARC-EX® or implantable ARC-IM® platforms  is designed to deliver targeted  programmed spinal cord stimulation. Positive results were presented in 2023 from the Company’s pivotal study  called Up-LIFT  evaluating the ability for transcutaneous ARC Therapy to improve upper extremity strength and function. The Company is now preparing regulatory approval submissions for ARC-EX for the US and Europe. In parallel  the Company is conducting studies with its implantable ARC-IM platform  which demonstrated positive interim clinical outcomes for improved blood pressure regulation  a component of hemodynamic instability  following SCI. Other ongoing studies include combination use of ARC-IM with a brain-computer interface (BCI) to address multiple symptoms of SCI.Headquartered in Eindhoven  the Netherlands  ONWARD Medical has a Science and Engineering Center in Lausanne  Switzerland and a US office in Boston  Massachusetts.

Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About BioSenic's technology platformsThe ATO platform has immunomodulatory properties with fundamental effects on the activated cells of the immune system. One direct application is its use in autoimmunity to treat in its chronic  established stage. Chronic GvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT)  a curative treatment for patients with serious blood diseases  including cancers.BioSenic’s intravenous ATO formulation  Arscimed®  has orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA  and it has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy for skin  mucosae  and the gastrointestinal tract in an early Phase 2a study. The company is planning a confirmatory international Phase 3 study with its oral ATO (OATO) formulation. OATO will also target moderate-to-severe forms of SLE. BioSenic is also developing a new IP-protected OATO formulation for the treatment of SSc  a serious chronic disease that affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and has no current effective treatment. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models support the launch of a Phase 2 clinical trial.ALLOB is an allogeneic cell therapy platform made of differentiated  bone marrow-sourced mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs)  which can be stored at the point-of-use in hospitals. ALLOB represents a unique and proprietary approach to organ repair  and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated MSCs from healthy donors into bone-forming cells at the site of injury. BioSenic is studying the results of a Phase 2 trial to optimise the efficacy of ALLOB by determining the best timing for therapeutic intervention and seeking partners to continue the development of the promising underlying therapy strategies.The company is also exploring partnerships at all levels for its JTA-004 viscosupplement for a severe inflammatory subtype of osteoarthritis  following a positive post hoc analysis of Phase 3 data demonstrating safety and efficacy in support of this licensing.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAFrançois Rieger  PhD  CEOTel: +33 (0)671 73 31 59investorrelations@biosenic.comInternational Media Enquiries:IB CommunicationsMichelle BoxallTel: +44 (0)20 8943 4685michelle@ibcomms.agencyFrench Investor Enquiries:Seitosei ActifinGhislaine GasparettoTel: +33 (0)1 56 88 11 22ghislaine.gasparetto@seitosei-actifin.comMichael Scholzemichael.scholze@seitosei-actifin.comCertain statements  beliefs and opinions in this press release are forward-looking  which reflect the company or  as appropriate  the company directors’ current expectations and projections about future events.
