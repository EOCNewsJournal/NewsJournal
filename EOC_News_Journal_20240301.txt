This transaction  which was carried out pursuant to a decision by the Company's shareholders at an Extraordinary General Meeting held on November 10  2023  took effect on February 27  2024.The old Spineway shares with a par value of €0.002 (ISIN code: FR001400BVK2) were delisted from the Euronext Growth market after the close of the market on February 26  2024 and were replaced with the new Spineway shares with a par value of €4.00 (ISIN code: FR001400N2P2) on February 27  2024. The mnemonic code (ALSPW) remains unchanged.As at 27 February 2024  Spineway's share capital comprised 832 962 shares with a par value of €4.00 each.It should be noted that  as of February 26  2024  after the close of the market  the new shares that could not be allotted individually and which correspond to fractional rights will be sold automatically by block on the market by financial intermediaries. The financial intermediaries will make the proceeds of the sale available to their shareholder clients within 30 days from February 26  2024. For more information on the reverse split  shareholders are invited to consult the notice of reverse split published in the BALO on January 10  2024  and available on the Company's website (www.spineway.com) and the press release published on January 5  2024 also available on the Company's website.Increase in share capitalFollowing conversions of Negma Group Ltd bonds between 22 January 2024 and 9 February 2024  the Company's Board of Directors  meeting on 29 February 2024  recorded the creation of 1 191 228 073 new ordinary shares and an increase in the share capital of a nominal amount of €2 382 456.15. As these conversions took place during the consolidation period  the new shares issued were taken into account in the exchange transactions.Reduction of the share capitalSubsequent to the reverse stock split  the Company's Board of Directors decided on 29 February 2024 to reduce the share capital by reducing the par value of the Company's shares1. This purely technical operation has no impact on the value of the Company's stock value  nor on the number of shares in circulation.

(Euronext: ONWD)  the medical technology company creating innovative spinal cord stimulation therapies to restore movement  function  and independence in people with spinal cord injury (SCI)  today announces it has been awarded Breakthrough Device Designation (BDD) by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the ARC-BCI System  which uses brain-computer interface (BCI) technology in conjunction with its ARC-IM® Therapy to restore thought-driven lower limb mobility after spinal cord injury (SCI). This BDD is supported by clinical data from two feasibility studies.This is the tenth FDA BDD awarded to ONWARD Medical. The designation is reserved for novel  cutting-edge therapies addressing an unmet need and provides many potential regulatory and reimbursement advantages. This latest award gives ONWARD Medical priority FDA review  the opportunity to interact with FDA experts throughout the pre-market regulatory review phase  and the potential to seek additional reimbursement for its ARC-BCI System.“Brain-computer interface technology unlocks the transformative potential to enhance ARC-IM with thought-driven control of movement after paralysis ” said ONWARD Medical CEO Dave Marver. “We look forward to learning more about the potential for this combination of ARC Therapy™ and a BCI to help people with spinal cord injury live more independently. We are also grateful to the FDA for recognizing our innovations and their potential to help people with profound unmet needs.”An implanted BCI records brain activity  capturing signals that indicate a person’s intention to move. The ARC-BCI System then uses artificial intelligence (AI) to decode those signals and translate them into specific instructions for the ARC-IM System  which converts the instructions into precise stimulation of the injured spinal cord. ARC-BCI creates a “digital bridge ” restoring communication between the brain and the body  enabling thought-driven movement after paralysis.In 2021  a BCI was paired with ARC-IM Therapy for the first time in history to restore movement of the lower limbs  including walking  after SCI. In May 2023  Nature published the results of this groundbreaking feasibility study  highlighting the study participant’s augmented control over his paralyzed legs with the addition of a BCI. ONWARD Medical was previously granted nine BDDs for multiple indications for its ARC Therapy platforms  including mobility and blood pressure regulation. The Company plans to launch its first product later this year.All ONWARD Medical devices and therapies  including but not limited to ARC-IM®  ARC-EX®  and ARC Therapy™  alone or in combination with a brain-computer interface (BCI)  are investigational and not available for commercial use.About ONWARD MedicalONWARD® Medical is a medical technology company creating therapies to restore movement  function  and independence in people with spinal cord injury (SCI) and movement disabilities.

In an environment characterised by high inflation and volatile and rising interest rates  these adjustments will allow Fluxys Belgium's margin to reach a fair level for the period 2024-2027.Fluxys Belgium and the CREG have agreed on certain changes they wish to make to the tariff methodology for the natural gas transmission system  the natural gas storage facility and the LNG facility for the regulatory period 2024-2027. The CREG and Fluxys Belgium believe that these changes are necessary to guarantee the system operators a fair return on the capital invested in the regulated assets  and to enable them to make the necessary investments in order to carry out their duties.The tariff methodology  adopted in June 2022  provides for the use of a risk-free rate of 1.68% to calculate the margin for the four years of the 2024-2027 regulatory period. In the current context of high interest rates volatility  an overall upward trend over the last two years and a particularly high inflation in 2022  the CREG and Fluxys Belgium have agreed to make the following three changes to the risk-free rate:1. Set the risk-free rate annually ex-post based on the evolution of the 10-year OLO rate actually observed on the markets;2. Keep the 1.68% rate currently included in the tariff methodology as a minimum guaranteed value;3. For investments made before 01/01/2022  if the 10-year OLO rate increases above 2.87%  only half of the increase of the 10-year OLO rate above 2.87% will be reflected in the risk-free rate. For investments made as from 01/01/2022  the entire increase of the 10-year OLO above 2.87% will be included in the risk-free rate.The impact of these changes will be covered by the regularization account. The tariffs set by the CREG for the 2024-2027 period therefore remain unchanged at this stage.A public consultation on these changes will be held on the CREG website from the 14th of March to the 14th of April 2024.Press contactPress team: +32 471 95 00 24 • press@fluxys.comAbout Fluxys BelgiumFluxys Belgium is a Euronext listed subsidiary of infrastructure group Fluxys headquarted in Belgium.

In November  a significant milestone was reached as the BW Opal hull arrived in Singapore  22 months after first steel cut at the construction yard in South Korea  marking the start of topside construction activities. Integration activities in Singapore are well underway  with 11 out of 16 topside modules successfully installed at the end of February.In January 2024  all shares in BW Energy were sold to BW Group Limited  for USD 176 million. Following the transaction  the Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of USD 0.088 per share  amounting to USD 15.9 million in total  for the fourth quarter of 2023.“We have a strong balance sheet after completing our fleet divestment programme and the sale of BW Energy shares  supported by strong cash generation from our FPSO fleet. This is reflected in our fourth quarter dividend which brings the total distribution based on 2023 results to USD 48.6 million  being the maximum allowed under our debt covenants  and shows our continuous commitment to returning value to shareholders ” said Marco Beenen  CEO of BW Offshore. “In Singapore  the BW Opal integration phase is still on track for first gas in the first half of 2025. The market for new FPSO projects remains strong with high FEED activity  and we continue to selectively progress growth opportunities that meet our selection criteria.”The shares of BW Offshore will trade ex-dividend from 4 March 2024. Shareholders recorded in VPS following the close of trading on Oslo Børs on 5 March 2024 will be entitled to the distribution payable on or about 12 March 2024. For 2024  the Company plans to continue to provide a stable  predictable quarterly cash dividend based on an annual total distribution of 0.25 cents per share  with a potential adjustment for the fourth quarter subject to  inter alia  net income for the full year and debt covenants.FINANCIALSEBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2023 was USD 91.1 million (USD 74.5 million in Q3). The EBITDA reflects solid operational performance across the FPSO fleet  further enhanced by the conclusion of the Petróleo Nautipa contract.EBIT for the fourth quarter was USD 44.3 million (USD 38.2 million). Gain from sale of fixed assets in the third quarter of USD 9.6 million relates to the sale of Abo FPSO.Net financial expense was USD 19.4 million (expense USD 2.5 million) of which net interest expense amounted to USD 9.0 million (USD 10.1 million). FX and other financial items were negative  mainly due to the mark-to-market on interest hedges as swap rates decreased.Share of profit from equity accounted investments was USD 17.5 million (USD 0.4 million) and relates to BW Offshore’s ownership in BW Energy.Tax expense was USD 2.4 million (USD 7.2 million). The higher tax expense in the third quarter is mainly due to tax on the sale of Abo FPSO.Net profit for the fourth quarter was USD 40.0 million (USD 28.9 million).Total equity on 31 December 2023 was USD 1 195.3 million (USD 1 179.8 million). The equity ratio was 30.2% at the end of the quarter (31.0%).Net interest-bearing debt was USD 172.2 million (USD 294.7 million).Available liquidity was USD 605.7 million  excluding consolidated cash from BW Ideol and including USD 245 million available under the corporate loan facility.FPSO OPERATIONSThe FPSO fleet continued to deliver stable uptime in the quarter with a weighted average fleet uptime of 97.3% (99.2% in Q3 2023). Fleet uptime was impacted by a planned shutdown on the BW Catcher FPSO.In December  Petróleo Nautipa was decommissioned from the field in Gabon and is expected to be sold for recycling in 2024.In October  BW Energy paid the first instalment of USD 30 million for the FPSO Polvo. The second and last instalment will be paid on 30 April 2024.On 6 January 2024  the BW Catcher contract was extended beyond the initial fixed term. The contract is subject to a rolling 12-month termination right. The contract automatically extends on a day-to-day basis beyond 6 January 2025 into the option period.BW ENERGYBW Energy had an average daily production of ~32 900 bbls/day in the fourth quarter from the Tortue and Hibiscus fields in the Dussafu licence and Golfinho field in Brazil.At the end of the fourth quarter  BW Offshore held 22.52% of the shares in BW Energy. The entire shareholding was divested to BW Group on 25 January 2024. The Company expects to record loss of USD 6.0 million on the book value of the BW Energy shares from the transaction in first quarter 2024 accounts.OFFSHORE FLOATING WINDBW Offshore is actively engaged in the energy transition by developing clean energy production solutions  applying its offshore engineering and operations capabilities to drive future value creation through its ownership in BW Ideol. BW Ideol is a global leader in offshore floating wind technology and co-development with more than 12 years of experience from design  execution and development of floating wind projects based on proprietary and patented Damping Pool® technology and engineering capabilities.In October  BW Ideol AS and ADEME Investissement completed an initial financial closing investing EUR 17.8 million into BW Ideol Projects Company SAS  with BW Ideol initially holding 75.8% and ADEME Investissement set to gradually increase its share under the EUR 40 million funding agreement. BW Ideol manages the development company through a service agreement. In November  BW Ideol signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to investigate the feasibility of serialised production of floating concrete substructures based on own design at APB’S Port Talbot to position for the upcoming UK Celtic Sea leasing round with a multi-GW development potential. The operational period for the Floatgen pilot in France was recently extended by five years. The unit has generated over 30 GWh of electricity since start of operations in 2018  underscoring the robustness of BW Ideol's design.On 20 December  the shares of BW Ideol were delisted from Euronext Growth Oslo following the completion of a compulsory offer for all shares outstanding by a consortium consisting of existing shareholders following an earlier voluntary tender offer. The delisting positions BW Ideol to raise capital more efficiently from investors that invest in privately held growth companies. Furthermore  the management at BW Ideol would benefit from freed-up management time to focus on core activities to develop the company. The delisting of BW Ideol is expected to facilitate funding and execution of the company’s dual-leg growth strategy as EPCI provider and project co-developer.OUTLOOKBW Offshore expects that the fleet will continue to generate significant cash flows in the time ahead. Based on the contract backlog  BW Offshore maintains the guidance of reporting an EBITDA in the range USD 290-310 million for 2024.Growing energy demand  underinvestment in production capacity and geopolitical conflicts continue to support high oil and gas prices and drive interest for developing new infrastructure-type FPSO projects. These projects typically have long production profiles  low break-even costs and focus on lower emissions. Increased project complexity  combined with inflationary pressures and higher construction costs  necessitates financial structures with significant dayrate prepayments during the construction period for new lease and operate projects. Alternatively  oil and gas majors may finance and own FPSOs  relying on FPSO specialists for the design  construction and installation scope  combined with operation and maintenance services.BW Offshore will continue to selectively evaluate new projects that meet required return targets  offer a firm contract with no residual value risk  and provide a financeable structure with strong national or investment-grade counterparties.BW Offshore is also actively applying its offshore engineering and operational capabilities to drive future value creation within the energy transition by developing low-carbon and clean energy production solutions. This includes exploring new ventures that target significant market opportunities emerging within gas-to-power  ammonia and carbon capture  as well as combining FPSO and floating offshore wind capabilities to grow in new  adjacent areas. BW Offshore maintains a disciplined approach with selective and diligent allocation of capital.Please see attached the Annual Report and Q4 Presentation.

As of September 30  2023  cash and cash equivalents totaled €93.9 million.This amount does not include the receipt in February 2024 of a €13.3 million milestone payment from Ipsen  which was invoiced in December 2023  triggered by the acceptance of the New Drug Application (NDA) filing by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for accelerated approval of elafibranor in Primary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC) in December 2023.As previously indicated in past communications1  in 2024 GENFIT expects to receive total milestone payments of approximately €89 million (including the €13.3 milestone already received in February 2024)  subject to the approval and commercialization of elafibranor in PBC.The decrease in cash and cash equivalents between September 30  2023  and December 31  2023  takes into account our continued research and development efforts  notably for:UNVEIL-IT™  our Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating VS-01 in Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure (ACLF);our cholangiocarcinoma program evaluating GNS561;our ACLF program evaluating NTZ;our non-clinical trial of SRT-015 in ACLF; andELATIVE®  specifically the portion of the Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating elafibranor in PBC that has not yet been transferred to Ipsen.We expect that our existing cash and cash equivalents will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements until approximately the fourth quarter of 2025. This is based on current assumptions and programs  and does not include exceptional events. This estimation includes our expectations to receive future milestone revenue in 2024  subject to approval by applicable regulatory authorities and US and European commercial launches of elafibranor in PBC by Ipsen  representing a total of approximately €75.2 million.RevenuesRevenues for 2023 amounted to €28.6 million compared to €20.2 million for the same period in 2022.Of the €28.6 million  €13.3 million was attributable to a milestone payment invoiced to Ipsen in December 2023 in accordance with the Collaboration and Licensing agreement signed in December 2021. This milestone payment was earned following the NDA filing acceptance by the FDA and MAA filing acceptance by the EMA for accelerated approval of elafibranor. €8.7 million in revenue was attributable to the partial recognition of the €40.0 million deferred income as described below. €6.5 million in revenue was generated from the services rendered under the Transition Services Agreement and Part B Transition Services Agreement  signed in April 2022 and September 2023 respectively by GENFIT and Ipsen  in order to facilitate the transition of certain services related to the Phase 3 ELATIVE® clinical trial until the complete transfer of the responsibility of the trial to Ipsen. €0.1 million was attributable to other ancillary activities.Of the €20.2 million in revenues for 2022  €15.9 million was attributable to the partial recognition of the €40.0 million deferred income per IFRS2 15 in accordance with the Collaboration and Licensing Agreement signed with Ipsen in 2021. €1.0 million in revenue was generated from services rendered by GENFIT to Ipsen in accordance with the Transition Services Agreement signed in 2022. €3.3 million was recognized as revenue in accordance with the Inventory Purchase Agreement signed with Ipsen in 2022  under which the Company sold almost all of its remaining stock of elafibranor’s active ingredient and drug products for the ELATIVE® Phase 3 clinical trial to Ipsen.Upcoming FDA PDUFA3 Action Date for Elafibranor in PBC: June 10  2024Regulatory filing acceptance has been obtained in the US  Europe and the United Kingdom4 and a Priority Review has been granted for an NDA by the FDA for elafibranor in PBC with a PDUFA target action date of June 10  2024.Upcoming Financial CommunicationsThe Company will release its full-year 2023 financial results on April 4  2024.

At the same time  and of no less importance to us  FirstFarms addresses and works ambitiously with the necessary (climate)transition that the agriculture is facing. We look forward to following and being a part of this "" says Lise Kaae  CEO Heartland A/S.The capital injection is made by the Board of Directors' decision today to increase FirstFarms’ share capital with nominally DKK 12 000 000 new shares of nominally DKK 10.00 each (""New Shares"") against cash payment of DKK 81 per share through a directed share issue from FirstFarms to Constantinsborg.Simultaneously  the Board of Directors in FirstFarms has decided to take out a loan of DKK 89 100 000 from Constantinsborg against issuance of convertible bonds without pre-emptive rights for existing shareholders and to carry out the associated capital increase of maximum nominal DKK 11 000 000.Details about the directed share issueThe New Shares will be issued by FirstFarms in accordance with the authorisation to the Board of Directors from FirstFarms' shareholders in articles 5.3.7 and 5.3.10 of the articles of association. The New Shares will be issued against cash payment without pre-emption rights for FirstFarms' existing shareholders.Registration of the capital increase with the Danish Business Authority will be made as soon as possible and the New Shares will be issued through Euronext Securities Copenhagen and admitted to trading on Nasdaq Copenhagen with ISIN DK0060056166 as soon as possible after registration of the capital increase with the Danish Business Authority.The New Shares carry the same rights as the existing shares  including the right to any dividends from and including the date of registration of the New Shares with the Danish Business Authority. Following the issuance of the New Shares  the Company's share capital will amount to nominally DKK 111 463 110 divided into 11 146 311 shares of nominally DKK 10.00 each  corresponding to 11 146 311 total voting rights. After the share issue  Constantinsborg will own 10.77 percent of FirstFarms' share capital and voting rights.Details about the issuance of convertible bondsThe convertible bonds are issued in accordance with the authorisation in FirstFarms' articles of association section 5.7 to issue convertible bonds and the related capital increase and will be registered with the Danish Business Authority as soon as possible.The loan according to the convertible bonds carries an interest rate of 5 percent p.a. and remains without instalments until the expiry of the term on 28 February 2029  after which FirstFarms shall repay the loan including interest  unless Constantinsborg has given notice of conversion of the loan to shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing  25% of the accrued interest in the period from the date of issue until 28 February 2026 is due for payment 10 banking days after the end of a quarter.Upon conversion of the loan into new shares  the new shares will be without pre-emption rights for the company's existing shareholders and with the same rights as the company's existing shares and will be admitted to trading on Nasdaq Copenhagen.The conversion price is fixed corresponding to a price of at least DKK 81 per share of a nominal value of DKK 10. The conversion price is adjusted with accrued unpaid interest  meaning that the proportion of the loan amount for conversion is added the unpaid interest  while the number of shares is calculated solely on the basis of the loan amount  resulting in a conversion price between DKK 81-101 per share depending on the time of exercise of the conversion right.

Thanks to CARBIOS’ highly selective enzyme  less sorting and washing is required compared to current recycling technologies  offering future savings in energy and water use. From 2026  Landbell Group will supply CARBIOS with 15 kt/year of PET flakes  ensuring a steady supply chain for sustainable PET production. These flakes will serve as essential feedstock for CARBIOS’ production of food-grade PTA and MEG  further re-polymerized into PET.Through the partnership with Landbell Group in Germany  the supply of multilayer trays through the CITEO tender in France and the MoU with Indorama Ventures  CARBIOS will have sourced over 70% of its feedstock required for the 50kt/year capacity when its first commercial plant in Longlaville  France  will operate at full capacity. Close to the borders with Belgium  Germany and Luxembourg  the plant’s location is strategic for nearby waste supplies.Through this partnership with CARBIOS  Landbell Group will ensure that the problematic PET fractions such as multilayered  colored and opaque trays from packaging waste and polyester textile waste are redirected towards recycling. In this way  Landbell Group strengthens its commitment to the development of innovative recycling solutions to enable a circular economy.Emmanuel Ladent  CEO of CARBIOS: “Through our new partnership with Landbell Group  CARBIOS secures a significant feedstock supply for our first commercial plant  and we are pleased to make biorecycled PET available to Landbell’s extensive client portfolio  powering a circular economy for plastic. CARBIOS’ innovative biorecycling technology enables the conversion of diverse wastes into valuable products  enhancing flexibility and competitiveness. By minimizing bottle usage and diversifying raw material sources  we’re advancing sustainability while meeting market demands effectively. Together  we’re forging a future where waste becomes a valuable resource.”Uwe Echteler  COO of Landbell Group: “PET trays are extensively used in food packaging due to their excellent barrier properties  transparency and strength. However  PET trays  especially with a multi-layered structure  currently pose a challenge for mechanical recycling. The innovative depolymerization process developed by CARBIOS facilitates the recycling of PET waste into high-quality recycled PET. Landbell Group and CARBIOS together will enable closed-loop recycling of problematic PET waste to allow its customers – packaging manufacturers and brands – to use recycled content in food packaging and meet their sustainability targets.”.The environmental benefits of CARBIOS’ biorecycling technologyRecent life-cycle analyses1 show a 57% reduction in CO 2 emissions compared with the production of virgin plastic2  and for every ton of recycled PET produced  1.3 tons of oil are avoided. Compared with conventional recycling  enzymatic recycling is 5 times more circular (calculated according to the Ellen MacArthur Foundation's Material Circularity Indicator 3 ). Thanks to its highly selective enzyme  optimized for efficient PET degradation  CARBIOS’ depolymerization process can process all types of PET waste  including colored  multilayer or textile waste that cannot be recycled using current technologies. Furthermore  the two monomers produced (PTA and MEG) make it possible to recreate recycled PET products of identical quality to petro-sourced ones  and suitable for food contact.###About CARBIOS:CARBIOS is a biotech company developing and industrializing biological solutions to reinvent the life cycle of plastic and textiles. Inspired by nature  CARBIOS develops enzyme-based processes to break down plastic with a mission to avoid plastic and textile pollution  and accelerate the transition to a circular economy. Its two disruptive technologies for the biorecycling of PET and the biodegradation of PLA are reaching industrial and commercial scale. Its biorecycling demonstration plant has been operational since 2021 and a first industrial plant  in partnership with Indorama Ventures  is due to be commissioned in 2025. CARBIOS  founded in 2011 by Truffle Capital  has received scientific recognition  notably with the cover of Nature  and is supported by prestigious brands in the cosmetics  Food & Beverage and apparel industries to enhance their products’ recyclability and circularity. Nestlé Waters  PepsiCo and Suntory Beverage & Food Europe are members of a packaging consortium founded by CARBIOS and L’Oréal.

Additionally  it may be considered for persons traveling to a country or territory without an outbreak but with evidence of CHIKV transmission within the last five years  who are aged >65 years and likely to have at least moderate exposure to mosquitos (at least two weeks  cumulatively) or who are traveling for a longer duration (six months or more  cumulatively). ACIP also recommended chikungunya vaccination for laboratory workers with potential for exposure to CHIKV.Juan Carlos Jaramillo  MD  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  commented  “Chikungunya poses a significant risk to individuals journeying to or residing in regions where the chikungunya virus and its mosquito vectors thrive. IXCHIQ offers advantages to travelers on vacation and visiting family and to people engaged in business ventures  missions  or laboratory duties. We embrace the ACIP endorsement  marking IXCHIQ® as the only approved and recommended vaccine for the target population. We will continue collaborating with regulatory authorities worldwide to increase the accessibility of IXCHIQ® across regions.”The ACIP recommendations will be forwarded to the director of the CDC and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for review and approval. Once approved  the final recommendations will be published in a future Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) to advise healthcare providers on appropriate use of the vaccine.About ChikungunyaChikungunya is a mosquito-borne viral disease caused by the chikungunya virus (CHIKV)  a Togaviridae virus  transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Infection leads to symptomatic disease in up to 97% of humans after four to seven days following the mosquito bite2. While mortality with CHIKV is low  morbidity is high  and the global market for vaccines against chikungunya is estimated to exceed $500 million annually by 20323. Clinical symptoms include acute onset of fever  debilitating joint and muscle pain  headache  nausea  rash and chronic arthralgia. Chikungunya virus often causes sudden large outbreaks with high attack rates  affecting one-third to three-quarters of the population in areas where the virus is circulating. The high-risk areas of infection for travelers are places where chikungunya virus-carrying mosquitos are endemic  including the Americas  parts of Africa  and Southeast Asia  and the virus has spread to more than 110 countries4. Between 2013 and 2023  more than 3.7 million cases were reported in the Americas5 and the economic impact is considered to be significant. The medical and economic burden is expected to grow as the CHIKV primary mosquito vectors continue to spread geographically. Before IXCHIQ®  there were no preventive vaccines or effective treatments available and  as such  chikungunya is considered to be a major public health threat.To make the vaccine more accessible to Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMIC)  Valneva and Instituto Butantan in Brazil signed an agreement in January 2021 for the development  manufacturing and marketing of VLA15536. The collaboration falls within the framework of the agreement signed between CEPI and Valneva in July 20197  which provides funding of up to $23.4 million with support from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 program. Regulatory review by the Brazilian authority ANVISA is ongoing.About IXCHIQ®In the U.S.  IXCHIQ® is a live-attenuated vaccine indicated for the prevention of disease caused by chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in individuals 18 years of age and older who are at increased risk of exposure to CHIKV. As for all products approved under FDA’s accelerated approval pathway  continued approval for this indication is contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory studies.Please click here for full Prescribing Information for IXCHIQ®.About Valneva SEWe are a specialty vaccine company that develops  manufactures  and commercializes prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases addressing unmet medical needs.

Additionally  it may be considered for persons traveling to a country or territory without an outbreak but with evidence of CHIKV transmission within the last five years  who are aged >65 years and likely to have at least moderate exposure to mosquitos (at least two weeks  cumulatively) or who are traveling for a longer duration (six months or more  cumulatively). ACIP also recommended chikungunya vaccination for laboratory workers with potential for exposure to CHIKV.Juan Carlos Jaramillo  MD  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  commented  “Chikungunya poses a significant risk to individuals journeying to or residing in regions where the chikungunya virus and its mosquito vectors thrive. IXCHIQ offers advantages to travelers on vacation and visiting family and to people engaged in business ventures  missions  or laboratory duties. We embrace the ACIP endorsement  marking IXCHIQ® as the only approved and recommended vaccine for the target population. We will continue collaborating with regulatory authorities worldwide to increase the accessibility of IXCHIQ® across regions.”The ACIP recommendations will be forwarded to the director of the CDC and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for review and approval. Once approved  the final recommendations will be published in a future Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) to advise healthcare providers on appropriate use of the vaccine.About ChikungunyaChikungunya is a mosquito-borne viral disease caused by the chikungunya virus (CHIKV)  a Togaviridae virus  transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Infection leads to symptomatic disease in up to 97% of humans after four to seven days following the mosquito bite2. While mortality with CHIKV is low  morbidity is high  and the global market for vaccines against chikungunya is estimated to exceed $500 million annually by 20323. Clinical symptoms include acute onset of fever  debilitating joint and muscle pain  headache  nausea  rash and chronic arthralgia. Chikungunya virus often causes sudden large outbreaks with high attack rates  affecting one-third to three-quarters of the population in areas where the virus is circulating. The high-risk areas of infection for travelers are places where chikungunya virus-carrying mosquitos are endemic  including the Americas  parts of Africa  and Southeast Asia  and the virus has spread to more than 110 countries4. Between 2013 and 2023  more than 3.7 million cases were reported in the Americas5 and the economic impact is considered to be significant. The medical and economic burden is expected to grow as the CHIKV primary mosquito vectors continue to spread geographically. Before IXCHIQ®  there were no preventive vaccines or effective treatments available and  as such  chikungunya is considered to be a major public health threat.To make the vaccine more accessible to Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMIC)  Valneva and Instituto Butantan in Brazil signed an agreement in January 2021 for the development  manufacturing and marketing of VLA15536. The collaboration falls within the framework of the agreement signed between CEPI and Valneva in July 20197  which provides funding of up to $23.4 million with support from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 program. Regulatory review by the Brazilian authority ANVISA is ongoing.About IXCHIQ®In the U.S.  IXCHIQ® is a live-attenuated vaccine indicated for the prevention of disease caused by chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in individuals 18 years of age and older who are at increased risk of exposure to CHIKV. As for all products approved under FDA’s accelerated approval pathway  continued approval for this indication is contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory studies.Please click here for full Prescribing Information for IXCHIQ®.About Valneva SEWe are a specialty vaccine company that develops  manufactures  and commercializes prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases addressing unmet medical needs.

Our revenue is increasing at constant exchange rates and our profitability is being maintained by the ongoing improvement in our competitiveness. At the end of this 2023-2024 1st first half year  the group’s revenue growth and profitability are in line with targets communicated in October 2023.Our mission is more than ever aligned with consumer expectations  which place plant-rich food at the heart of consumer trends. The turnaround in profitability is an essential catalyst in our strategy of positive impact with sustainable growth and in support of this mission.The Bonduelle Group is committed to sustainable and local agriculture based on the principles of regenerative agriculture to which 46% of our growers are already committed. As a family business  we have been working hand-in-hand for decades with our farming partners  with whom we’ve forged strong ties.Our relationship is based on trust  exchange of know-how and goes far beyond a contractual relationship. These ties are a strength in meeting the sector’s environmental challenges  while offering our consumers healthy and quality products.With the commitment and agility of all the group’s employees  we will pursue our transformation and efficiency efforts in the second half year  to enable us to achieve the targets set for 2023-2024.*******The 2023-2024 half year financial statements were approved by the General Partner  then reviewed by the Supervisory Board of February 29  2024 and by the Statutory Auditors.Key figures(in millions of euros) 1st half year2023-2024 1st half year2022-2023 Variations Revenue 1 213.1 1 243.4 -2.4% Current operating income 38.5 43.1 -10.7% Current operating margin 3.2% 3.5% -29 bps Consolidated net income 4.5 20.0 -77.4% Gearing(2) 0.95 0.79RevenueThe Bonduelle Group’s revenue for the 1st half of fiscal year 2023-2024 amounted 1 213.1 million euros compared with 1 243.4 million euros for the 1st half of previous fiscal year  up +4.5% on a like-for-like basis(1) and down -2.4% on reported figures.Activity by Geographical RegionTotal consolidated revenue(in millions of euros) 1st half year2023-2024 1st half year2022-2023 VariationReported figures VariationLike-for-like basis(1) Europe Zone 786.4 739.1 6.4% 5.9% Non-Europe Zone 426.6 504.2 -15.4% 2.5% Total 1 213.1 1 243.4 -2.4% 4.5%Activity by Operating SegmentsTotal consolidated revenue(in millions of euros) 1st half year2023-2024 1st half year2022-2023 VariationReported figures VariationLike-for-like basis(1) Canned 594.7 597.1 -0.4% 10.6% Frozen 148.9 138.5 7.5% 9.3% Fresh processed 469.5 507.7 -7.5% -3.9% Total 1 213.1 1 243.4 -2.4% 4.5%Europe ZoneThe Europe Zone representing 64.8% of the business activity over the period  posted overall growth of +6.4% on reported figures and +5.9% on a like-for-like basis(1) over the 1st half year  with all technologies showing growth over the period.The downturn in volumes remains limited in the region despite a significant weakness in food consumption. In canned and frozen retail activity  the private label category grew in both volume and value  while branded products (Bonduelle and Cassegrain) increased in value but fell back in volume.The food service activity continued to grow  in both volume and value.The fresh processed segment (bagged salads) was virtually stable in volume  but grew in value in retail. However  the situation varied from one region to another  with France affected by bad weather leading to a lower service rate. Germany is operating in a difficult market context while Italy is recording solid growth.Fresh prepared segment posted growth over the period  fuelled by range renovations.Non-Europe ZoneThe Non-Europe Zone revenue representing 35.2% of the business activity over the period  posted an overall decline of -15.4% on reported figures and +2.5% on a like-for-like basis(1).The activity was clearly penalized by the translation effects of the Russian ruble  which lost an average of 40% of its value between the 1st half of the 2023-2024 fiscal year and the same half of the previous fiscal year.In the Eurasia region  the canned activity remained sustained in terms of volume and value  for both branded products (which are largely predominant in the region) and private label category. The frozen activity recovered significantly over the last quarter and now shows sustained growth in volume and value over the period as a whole.In North America  the decline in fresh processed products (bagged salads and meal solutions) remained more limited than in the same period last year  due to negative market trends. In this context  branded complete meal solutions based on salads as well as salad kits (salad bags with ingredients) posted significant market share gains.Operating IncomeThe Bonduelle Group’s recurring operating income for 2023-2024 1st half year stands at 38.5 million euros at current exchange rate and at 50.5 million euros at constant exchange rates against 43.1 million euros the previous year. This corresponds to a +17.1% increase in current operating income  i.e. a current operating margin of 3.9% on a like-for-like basis(1) and 3.2% on reported figures.The Europe Zone succeeded in maintaining an operating margin of 5.6% on a like-for-like basis(1)  close to that of the 1st half year of the previous year  thanks to price upgrades and productivity efforts which helped to partially absorb increases in production costs  in particular for agricultural materials.Profitability of the Non-Europe Zone  although still lower than Europe  is improving under the effect of the industrial competitiveness measures initiated in spring 2023 in North America and continued buoyant activity in Eurasia despite a very unfavorable exchange rate equation.After taking into account non-recurring items of -5 million euros over the period  mainly reflecting a decision by the French Competition Authority  the Bonduelle Group operating income stands at 33.4 million euros on reported figures  compared with 41.5 million euros for the same period last year.Net ResultFinancial result came to -17.4 million euros  compared with -17.5 million euros at the end of the previous half year. Interest expense for the half year rose from -11.5 million euros to -15.6 million euros  mainly due to the increase of interest rates (partially offset by interest-rate hedges) and an increase in indebtedness linked to the rise in inventories both in volume and value (inflation). The group’s average financing rate increased over the period.The foreign exchange result for the half year was balanced (-0.2 million euros)  compared with a loss of -4.5 million euros for the same period last year.The tax charge stands at 12.5 million euros against 13.1 million euros in the 1st half of previous fiscal year  with the effective tax rate (78.3%) still distorted by the non-activation of losses from the North American fresh activities on the one hand and the non-deductibility of the penalty imposed by the French Competition Authority on the other.Result from associates amounts to 1.1 million euros  mainly corresponding to the group’s share in the net result of Nortera Foods  which is accounted for under the equity method.After taking into account financial result  tax charge and result of equity method  the Bonduelle Group’s consolidated net result for 2023-2024 1st half year amounted to 4.5 million euros  compared with 20.0 million euros the previous fiscal year  representing 0.4% of revenue.Financial SituationNet financial debt (excluding IFRS 16) stood on December 31  2023 at 649 million euros against 556.7 million euros at December 31 of the previous fiscal year. After taking IFRS 16 into account  debt stood at 716.5 million euros (versus 633.9 million euros at December 31 of the previous fiscal year)  and the debt-to-equity ratio (gearing(2)) was 0.95  compared with 0.79 at the same period last year.The rebuilding of inventories in terms of volume  and their revaluation due to significant increases in production costs  in particular agricultural raw materials  explains the rise in debt over the period  it being specified that the seasonal nature of the activity (summer agricultural harvests) results in a high level of debt at December 31  which is not representative of average debt or debt at the end of fiscal year.Other significant informationAnnual Shareholder’s Meeting held on Dec 7  2023The Bonduelle Group's Annual Shareholder’s Meeting held on December 7  2023 approved the payment of a dividend of 0.25 euro per share  with effective payment on January 4  2024  as well as the election of Rémi Duriez to replace Matthieu Duriez  whose mandate expired at this meeting  and the reappointment of Jean-Michel Thierry as members of the Supervisory Board.OutlookLike the whole food industry  the Bonduelle Group operates in a general context of declining consumption  weighing on sales volumes  and inflation in production costs  partly offset by limited price increases.Despite this environment  given the performance recorded in the 1st half year and all the commercial initiatives of targeted activations and promotions  the continuous improvement of our industrial efficiency and the strict control of our overheads  the Bonduelle Group confirms its objectives of revenue growth of around 5% and an increase in current operating income of around 15% on a like-for-like basis(1)  announced in October 2023.(1) at constant currency exchange rate and scope of consolidation basis.

Our revenue is increasing at constant exchange rates and our profitability is being maintained by the ongoing improvement in our competitiveness. At the end of this 2023-2024 1st first half year  the group’s revenue growth and profitability are in line with targets communicated in October 2023.Our mission is more than ever aligned with consumer expectations  which place plant-rich food at the heart of consumer trends. The turnaround in profitability is an essential catalyst in our strategy of positive impact with sustainable growth and in support of this mission.The Bonduelle Group is committed to sustainable and local agriculture based on the principles of regenerative agriculture to which 46% of our growers are already committed. As a family business  we have been working hand-in-hand for decades with our farming partners  with whom we’ve forged strong ties.Our relationship is based on trust  exchange of know-how and goes far beyond a contractual relationship. These ties are a strength in meeting the sector’s environmental challenges  while offering our consumers healthy and quality products.With the commitment and agility of all the group’s employees  we will pursue our transformation and efficiency efforts in the second half year  to enable us to achieve the targets set for 2023-2024.*******The 2023-2024 half year financial statements were approved by the General Partner  then reviewed by the Supervisory Board of February 29  2024 and by the Statutory Auditors.Key figures(in millions of euros) 1st half year2023-2024 1st half year2022-2023 Variations Revenue 1 213.1 1 243.4 -2.4% Current operating income 38.5 43.1 -10.7% Current operating margin 3.2% 3.5% -29 bps Consolidated net income 4.5 20.0 -77.4% Gearing(2) 0.95 0.79RevenueThe Bonduelle Group’s revenue for the 1st half of fiscal year 2023-2024 amounted 1 213.1 million euros compared with 1 243.4 million euros for the 1st half of previous fiscal year  up +4.5% on a like-for-like basis(1) and down -2.4% on reported figures.Activity by Geographical RegionTotal consolidated revenue(in millions of euros) 1st half year2023-2024 1st half year2022-2023 VariationReported figures VariationLike-for-like basis(1) Europe Zone 786.4 739.1 6.4% 5.9% Non-Europe Zone 426.6 504.2 -15.4% 2.5% Total 1 213.1 1 243.4 -2.4% 4.5%Activity by Operating SegmentsTotal consolidated revenue(in millions of euros) 1st half year2023-2024 1st half year2022-2023 VariationReported figures VariationLike-for-like basis(1) Canned 594.7 597.1 -0.4% 10.6% Frozen 148.9 138.5 7.5% 9.3% Fresh processed 469.5 507.7 -7.5% -3.9% Total 1 213.1 1 243.4 -2.4% 4.5%Europe ZoneThe Europe Zone representing 64.8% of the business activity over the period  posted overall growth of +6.4% on reported figures and +5.9% on a like-for-like basis(1) over the 1st half year  with all technologies showing growth over the period.The downturn in volumes remains limited in the region despite a significant weakness in food consumption. In canned and frozen retail activity  the private label category grew in both volume and value  while branded products (Bonduelle and Cassegrain) increased in value but fell back in volume.The food service activity continued to grow  in both volume and value.The fresh processed segment (bagged salads) was virtually stable in volume  but grew in value in retail. However  the situation varied from one region to another  with France affected by bad weather leading to a lower service rate. Germany is operating in a difficult market context while Italy is recording solid growth.Fresh prepared segment posted growth over the period  fuelled by range renovations.Non-Europe ZoneThe Non-Europe Zone revenue representing 35.2% of the business activity over the period  posted an overall decline of -15.4% on reported figures and +2.5% on a like-for-like basis(1).The activity was clearly penalized by the translation effects of the Russian ruble  which lost an average of 40% of its value between the 1st half of the 2023-2024 fiscal year and the same half of the previous fiscal year.In the Eurasia region  the canned activity remained sustained in terms of volume and value  for both branded products (which are largely predominant in the region) and private label category. The frozen activity recovered significantly over the last quarter and now shows sustained growth in volume and value over the period as a whole.In North America  the decline in fresh processed products (bagged salads and meal solutions) remained more limited than in the same period last year  due to negative market trends. In this context  branded complete meal solutions based on salads as well as salad kits (salad bags with ingredients) posted significant market share gains.Operating IncomeThe Bonduelle Group’s recurring operating income for 2023-2024 1st half year stands at 38.5 million euros at current exchange rate and at 50.5 million euros at constant exchange rates against 43.1 million euros the previous year. This corresponds to a +17.1% increase in current operating income  i.e. a current operating margin of 3.9% on a like-for-like basis(1) and 3.2% on reported figures.The Europe Zone succeeded in maintaining an operating margin of 5.6% on a like-for-like basis(1)  close to that of the 1st half year of the previous year  thanks to price upgrades and productivity efforts which helped to partially absorb increases in production costs  in particular for agricultural materials.Profitability of the Non-Europe Zone  although still lower than Europe  is improving under the effect of the industrial competitiveness measures initiated in spring 2023 in North America and continued buoyant activity in Eurasia despite a very unfavorable exchange rate equation.After taking into account non-recurring items of -5 million euros over the period  mainly reflecting a decision by the French Competition Authority  the Bonduelle Group operating income stands at 33.4 million euros on reported figures  compared with 41.5 million euros for the same period last year.Net ResultFinancial result came to -17.4 million euros  compared with -17.5 million euros at the end of the previous half year. Interest expense for the half year rose from -11.5 million euros to -15.6 million euros  mainly due to the increase of interest rates (partially offset by interest-rate hedges) and an increase in indebtedness linked to the rise in inventories both in volume and value (inflation). The group’s average financing rate increased over the period.The foreign exchange result for the half year was balanced (-0.2 million euros)  compared with a loss of -4.5 million euros for the same period last year.The tax charge stands at 12.5 million euros against 13.1 million euros in the 1st half of previous fiscal year  with the effective tax rate (78.3%) still distorted by the non-activation of losses from the North American fresh activities on the one hand and the non-deductibility of the penalty imposed by the French Competition Authority on the other.Result from associates amounts to 1.1 million euros  mainly corresponding to the group’s share in the net result of Nortera Foods  which is accounted for under the equity method.After taking into account financial result  tax charge and result of equity method  the Bonduelle Group’s consolidated net result for 2023-2024 1st half year amounted to 4.5 million euros  compared with 20.0 million euros the previous fiscal year  representing 0.4% of revenue.Financial SituationNet financial debt (excluding IFRS 16) stood on December 31  2023 at 649 million euros against 556.7 million euros at December 31 of the previous fiscal year. After taking IFRS 16 into account  debt stood at 716.5 million euros (versus 633.9 million euros at December 31 of the previous fiscal year)  and the debt-to-equity ratio (gearing(2)) was 0.95  compared with 0.79 at the same period last year.The rebuilding of inventories in terms of volume  and their revaluation due to significant increases in production costs  in particular agricultural raw materials  explains the rise in debt over the period  it being specified that the seasonal nature of the activity (summer agricultural harvests) results in a high level of debt at December 31  which is not representative of average debt or debt at the end of fiscal year.Other significant informationAnnual Shareholder’s Meeting held on Dec 7  2023The Bonduelle Group's Annual Shareholder’s Meeting held on December 7  2023 approved the payment of a dividend of 0.25 euro per share  with effective payment on January 4  2024  as well as the election of Rémi Duriez to replace Matthieu Duriez  whose mandate expired at this meeting  and the reappointment of Jean-Michel Thierry as members of the Supervisory Board.OutlookLike the whole food industry  the Bonduelle Group operates in a general context of declining consumption  weighing on sales volumes  and inflation in production costs  partly offset by limited price increases.Despite this environment  given the performance recorded in the 1st half year and all the commercial initiatives of targeted activations and promotions  the continuous improvement of our industrial efficiency and the strict control of our overheads  the Bonduelle Group confirms its objectives of revenue growth of around 5% and an increase in current operating income of around 15% on a like-for-like basis(1)  announced in October 2023.(1) at constant currency exchange rate and scope of consolidation basis.

Clinically  we generated significant data through multiple study readouts  achieving key milestones for both the CIDP and MMN patient communities and importantly advancing our second molecule  empasiprubart. Looking forward to 2024  we will act with a continued sense of purpose to expand our patient reach. We will use the learnings and momentum from our gMG launch to strategically lay the groundwork for a potential CIDP approval  leveraging our current infrastructure and deep relationships in the neurology community to position VYVGART SC for success. CIDP patients have been waiting for innovation  and we are eager to translate the transformative ADHERE data into potential benefit for patients as quickly as possible.”FOURTH QUARTER 2023 AND RECENT BUSINESS UPDATEReaching More Patients with VYVGARTVYVGART® (efgartigimod alfa-fcab) is a first-in-class antibody fragment targeting the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)  and is now approved in more than 30 countries globally for the treatment of generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG).

Normalized EBITDA and normalized EBIT do not have a standard calculation method and AB InBev’s definition of normalized EBITDA and normalized EBIT may not be comparable to that of other companies.Argentinean Peso devaluationIn December 2023  the Argentinean Peso underwent a significant devaluation with the USDARS exchange rate closing at 809 on 31 December 2023 compared to 350 on 30 September 2023. IFRS (IAS 29) require us to restate the year-to-date results for the change in the general purchasing power of the local currency  using official indices before converting the local amounts at the closing rate of the period (i.e. FY23 and FY22 results at the closing rate on 31 December 2023 and 2022  respectively). The December 2023 devaluation negatively impacted our revenue and Normalized EBITDA as reported in 4Q23 and FY23. The impact of hyperinflation accounting in 4Q22 and 4Q23  as well as FY22 and FY23 were as follows:Impact of hyperinflation (million USD) Revenue 4Q22 4Q23 FY22 FY23 Indexing (1) 161 156 483 561 Currency(2) -268 -855 -578 -1 279 Total impact -107 -699 -95 -717 Normalized EBITDA 4Q22 4Q23 FY22 FY23 Indexing (1) 41 83 150 211 Currency(2) -107 -356 -209 -525 Total impact -66 -274 -59 -314 USDARS average rate 128 294 USDARS closing rate 177 809(1) Indexation calculated at closing rate (2) Currency impact from hyperinflation calculated as the difference between converting the Argentinean peso (ARS) reported amounts at the closing exchange rate compared to the average exchange rate of each periodFinancial positionFigure 13.

Net increase/(decrease) in cash and cash equivalents -1 942 315FY23 recorded an increase in cash and cash equivalents of 315 million USD compared to a decrease of 1 942 million USD in FY22  with the following movements:Our cash flow from operating activities reached 13 265 million USD in FY23 compared to 13 298 million USD in FY22. The decrease was driven by changes in working capital for FY23 compared to FY22 as a result of (i) higher trade and other receivables due partially to increased sales in December 2023 versus December 2022 and extended credit terms to our wholesalers in the US  and (ii) a decrease in trade and other payables due to lower inventory purchases and net capex  and US volume performance.Our cash outflow from investing activities was 4 354 million USD in FY23 compared to a cash outflow of 4 620 million USD in FY22. The decrease in the cash outflow from investing activities was mainly due to lower net capital expenditures in FY23 compared to FY22. Out of the total FY23 capital expenditures  approximately 40% was used to improve the company’s production facilities while 44% was used for logistics and commercial investments and 16% was used for improving administrative capabilities and for the purchase of hardware and software.Our cash outflow from financing activities amounted to 8 596 million USD in FY23  as compared to a cash outflow of 10 620 million USD in FY22. The decrease is primarily driven by lower debt redemption in FY23 compared to FY22.Our net debt decreased to 67.6 billion USD as of 31 December 2023 from 69.7 billion USD as of 31 December 2022.Our net debt to normalized EBITDA ratio was 3.38x as of 31 December 2023. Our optimal capital structure is a net debt to normalized EBITDA ratio of around 2x.We continue to proactively manage our debt portfolio. After redemptions in December 2023 of 3 billion USD  98% of our bond portfolio holds a fixed-interest rate  41% is denominated in currencies other than USD and maturities are well-distributed across the next several years.In addition to a very comfortable debt maturity profile and strong cash flow generation  as of 31 December 2023  we had total liquidity of 20.5 billion USD  which consisted of 10.1 billion USD available under committed long-term credit facilities and 10.4 billion USD of cash  cash equivalents and short-term investments in debt securities less bank overdrafts.2024 presentation updateFor FY24  the definition of organic revenue growth has been amended to cap the price growth in Argentina to a maximum of 2% per month. Corresponding adjustments will be made to all income statement related items in the organic growth calculations.Proposed full year 2023 dividendThe AB InBev Board proposes a full year 2023 dividend of 0.82 EUR per share  subject to shareholder approval at the AGM on 24 April 2024. In line with the Company’s financial discipline and deleveraging objectives  the recommended dividend balances the Company’s capital allocation priorities and dividend policy while returning cash to shareholders. A timeline showing the ex-dividend  record and payment dates can be found below:Dividend Timeline Ex-dividend date Record Date Payment date Euronext 3 May 2024 6 May 2024 7 May 2024 MEXBOL 3 May 2024 6 May 2024 7 May 2024 JSE 2 May 2024 6 May 2024 7 May 2024 NYSE (ADR program) 3 May 2024 6 May 2024 7 June 2024 Restricted Shares 3 May 2024 6 May 2024 7 May 2024NotesTo facilitate the understanding of AB InBev’s underlying performance  the analyses of growth  including all comments in this press release  unless otherwise indicated  are based on organic growth and normalized numbers. In other words  financials are analyzed eliminating the impact of changes in currencies on translation of foreign operations  and scope changes. Scope changes represent the impact of acquisitions and divestitures  the start or termination of activities or the transfer of activities between segments  curtailment gains and losses and year over year changes in accounting estimates and other assumptions that management does not consider as part of the underlying performance of the business. The organic growth of our global brands  Budweiser  Stella Artois  Corona and Michelob Ultra  excludes exports to Australia for which a perpetual license was granted to a third party upon disposal of the Australia operations in 2020. All references per hectoliter (per hl) exclude US non-beer activities. Whenever presented in this document  all performance measures (EBITDA  EBIT  profit  tax rate  EPS) are presented on a “normalized” basis  which means they are presented before non-underlying items. Non-underlying items are either income or expenses which do not occur regularly as part of the normal activities of the Company. They are presented separately because they are important for the understanding of the underlying sustainable performance of the Company due to their size or nature. Normalized measures are additional measures used by management and should not replace the measures determined in accordance with IFRS as an indicator of the Company’s performance. As from 1 January 2023  mark-to-market gains/(losses) on derivatives related to the hedging of our share-based payment programs are reported in the non-underlying net finance income/(cost). The 2022 presentation was amended to conform to the 2023 presentation. We are reporting the results from Argentina applying hyperinflation accounting since 3Q18. The IFRS rules (IAS 29) require us to restate the year-to-date results for the change in the general purchasing power of the local currency  using official indices before converting the local amounts at the closing rate of the period. These impacts are excluded from organic calculations. In FY23  we reported a negative impact on the profit attributable to equity holders of AB InBev of 203 million USD. The impact in FY23 Basic EPS was -0.10 USD. Values in the figures and annexes may not add up  due to rounding. 4Q23 and FY23 EPS is based upon a weighted average of 2 016 million shares compared to a weighted average of 2 013 million shares for 4Q22 and FY22.Legal disclaimerThis release contains “forward-looking statements”.

Technip Energies (the “Company”)  a leading Engineering & Technology company for the energy transition  today announces its unaudited financial results for full year 2023.Arnaud Pieton  Chief Executive Officer of Technip Energies  commented:“2023 represents an outstanding year in terms of safety  profitability  and orders  as well as for the delivery of strategic objectives to drive future growth. I would like to thank our employees and all stakeholders for their dedication  trust and support through this remarkable phase of Technip Energies’ evolution”.“We posted excellent operating results that reflect a relentless focus on execution and discipline  which strongly endorse our hybrid model. Technology  Products and Services - TPS - delivered more than 40% EBIT growth  while Project Delivery profitability remained high thanks to strong execution and project close-outs. This operational performance  combined with consistently high cash conversion from EBIT  drove robust free cash flow generation. Based on the strength of these results and confidence in our outlook  we propose a 10% annual dividend increase and are launching a €100 million share buyback program.”“Commercially  we secured €10 billion of order intake  significantly exceeding 2023 revenue and bolstering earnings visibility. Project Delivery benefited from the major North Field South award in Qatar  confirming our leading position in LNG  and TPS momentum continued to be strong  including over 90 studies from our Capture.Now™ platform.“We also set out to drive early leadership in net-zero markets through the launch of differentiated technologies  products and solutions. These provide us with more avenues for long-term growth and position Technip Energies to play a prominent role in targeted markets including carbon capture  clean hydrogen  and sustainable chemistry. While these markets are maturing at different speeds  early commercial traction for our new offerings is highly encouraging  notably in carbon capture.”“On our sustainability journey  we achieved strong safety performance that confirms Technip Energies’ industry leadership  and made solid progress towards our 2030 Net Zero target for scope 1 & 2 emissions. In addition  all of our technology and innovation programs are now dedicated to sustainability themes to strengthen our competitive positioning.”“Looking ahead  our focus will remain on areas where we bring differentiated capabilities and core competencies  and we are confident that our hybrid model provides us with a strong platform to navigate geopolitical developments that could affect the market. Our backlog provides excellent visibility  and the quality of our commercial pipeline is evidenced by material prospects - in LNG  carbon capture and other key markets - that are progressing towards investment decisions in 2024.”“Our priorities for 2024 are to strengthen our leadership in low-carbon LNG and net zero solutions  to build proprietary technology demonstration projects in decarbonization and circularity  and to form strategic partnerships crucial to fast-track deployment of clean tech solutions at commercial scale.”“Scaling clean energy technologies and emissions abatement are new demands being placed on producers and industries to drive sustainable development. For this  Technip Energies is the technology and industrial partner of choice.”“To respond to the scale of the Net Zero challenge  together  we must rise to the challenge of scale.”Key financials – adjusted IFRS(In € millions  except EPS and %) FY 2023 FY 2022 Revenue 6 014.7 6 424.4 Recurring EBIT 445.1 451.1 Recurring EBIT margin % 7.4% 7.0% Net profit 294.1 320.2 Diluted earnings per share(1) €1.63 €1.79 Order intake 10 070.1 3 844.8 Backlog 15 713.3 12 750.1 Financial information is presented under adjusted IFRS (see Appendix 8.0 for complete definition).

Adjusted order intake in the fourth quarter amounted to €562 million  which included a proprietary technology  engineering  and procurement services contract for Dow’s net-zero integrated ethylene cracker in Canada as well as other studies  services contracts and smaller projects.The first nine months included a major LNG contract for the North Field South Project by QatarEnergy  a significant ethylene proprietary equipment contract for QatarEnergy and CPChem’s Ras Laffan petrochemicals complex in Qatar  a significant contract for the electric-driven Xi’An LNG project in China  a FEED for Calpine’s carbon capture project in Texas  US  a FEED for the world’s largest low-carbon hydrogen project at ExxonMobil’s Baytown facility in Texas  US  a significant contract for a hydrogen production unit at bp’s Kwinana biorefinery in Australia  two EPsCm contracts for an advanced biofuels unit and a green hydrogen unit for Galp in its Sines refinery in Portugal  a PMC contract with Aramco for the master planning of Ras Al Khair  a new industrial city in Saudi Arabia  as well as other studies  services contracts and smaller projects.Adjusted backlog increased by 23% year-over-year to €15.7 billion  equivalent to 2.6x 2023 full year revenue. Adjusted backlog in the fourth quarter was impacted by three factors beyond foreign exchange: (1) the cancellation of a large EPC contract by Hafslund Oslo Celsio; (2) an adjustment to long lead items on recently awarded LNG projects; and (3) a technical reduction associated with variable consideration  which may reverse in the future. In aggregate  these factors led to a negative backlog adjustment of €861.6 million. In addition  Adjusted backlog was negatively impacted by foreign exchange of €230.6 million.(In € millions) FY 2023 FY 2022 Adjusted order intake 10 070.1 3 844.8 Project Delivery 8 311.5 1 682.1 Technology  Products & Services 1 758.6 2 162.8 Adjusted backlog 15 713.3 12 750.1 Project Delivery 13 884.1 10 727.9 Technology  Products & Services 1 829.2 2 022.2 Reconciliation of IFRS to non-IFRS financial measures are provided in appendices.Adjusted backlog at December 31  2023  has been impacted negatively by foreign exchange of €230.6 million.The table below provides estimated backlog scheduling as of December 31  2023.(In € millions) FY 2024 FY 2025 FY 2026+ Adjusted backlog 5 097.0 4 070.3 6 546.0Company financial performanceAdjusted statement of income(In € millions  except %) FY 2023 FY 2022 % Change Adjusted revenue 6 014.7 6 424.4 (6)% Adjusted EBITDA 540.4 560.2 (4)% Adjusted recurring EBIT 445.1 451.1 (1)% Non-recurring items (45.0) (1.4) N/A EBIT 400.1 449.7 (11)% Financial income (expense)  net 86.2 15.5 N/A Profit (loss) before income tax 486.3 465.2 5% Income tax (expense) profit (145.4) (131.5) 11% Net profit (loss) 340.9 333.7 2% Net profit (loss) attributable to Technip Energies Group 294.1 320.2 (8)% Net profit (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests 46.8 13.5 N/ABusiness highlightsProject Delivery – adjusted IFRS(In € millions  except % and bps) FY 2023 FY 2022 % Change Revenue 4 078.2 5 023.9 (19)% Recurring EBIT 318.1 396.0 (20)% Recurring EBIT margin % 7.8% 7.9% -10 bps Financial information is presented under adjusted IFRS (see Appendix 8.0 for complete definition).FY 2023 Adjusted revenue decreased by 19% year-over-year to €4 078.2 million. The continued ramp-up of activity on Qatar NFE  an initial contribution from Qatar NFS  and good volumes in downstream projects  including ethylene  were more than offset by significantly lower revenue contribution from LNG projects in Russia following the completion of the warranty phase on Yamal LNG in 2022 and the orderly exit from Arctic LNG 2.FY 2023 Adjusted recurring EBIT decreased by 20% year-over-year to €318.1 million  broadly in line with the reduction in revenue. FY 2023 Adjusted recurring EBIT margin decreased slightly year-over-year by 10 bps to 7.8%  but remained close to historic high levels due to continued strong execution on late stage LNG and downstream projects  and favorable project close outs.Q4 2023 Key operational milestones(Please refer to Q1 2023  H1 2023 and 9M 2023 press releases for first nine months milestones)Qatar Energy North Field Expansion (Qatar)Shipment and delivery of all essential LNG equipment  and primary mechanical equipment installed.

Technip Energies (the “Company”)  a leading Engineering & Technology company for the energy transition  today announces its unaudited financial results for full year 2023.Arnaud Pieton  Chief Executive Officer of Technip Energies  commented:“2023 represents an outstanding year in terms of safety  profitability  and orders  as well as for the delivery of strategic objectives to drive future growth. I would like to thank our employees and all stakeholders for their dedication  trust and support through this remarkable phase of Technip Energies’ evolution”.“We posted excellent operating results that reflect a relentless focus on execution and discipline  which strongly endorse our hybrid model. Technology  Products and Services - TPS - delivered more than 40% EBIT growth  while Project Delivery profitability remained high thanks to strong execution and project close-outs. This operational performance  combined with consistently high cash conversion from EBIT  drove robust free cash flow generation. Based on the strength of these results and confidence in our outlook  we propose a 10% annual dividend increase and are launching a €100 million share buyback program.”“Commercially  we secured €10 billion of order intake  significantly exceeding 2023 revenue and bolstering earnings visibility. Project Delivery benefited from the major North Field South award in Qatar  confirming our leading position in LNG  and TPS momentum continued to be strong  including over 90 studies from our Capture.Now™ platform.“We also set out to drive early leadership in net-zero markets through the launch of differentiated technologies  products and solutions. These provide us with more avenues for long-term growth and position Technip Energies to play a prominent role in targeted markets including carbon capture  clean hydrogen  and sustainable chemistry. While these markets are maturing at different speeds  early commercial traction for our new offerings is highly encouraging  notably in carbon capture.”“On our sustainability journey  we achieved strong safety performance that confirms Technip Energies’ industry leadership  and made solid progress towards our 2030 Net Zero target for scope 1 & 2 emissions. In addition  all of our technology and innovation programs are now dedicated to sustainability themes to strengthen our competitive positioning.”“Looking ahead  our focus will remain on areas where we bring differentiated capabilities and core competencies  and we are confident that our hybrid model provides us with a strong platform to navigate geopolitical developments that could affect the market. Our backlog provides excellent visibility  and the quality of our commercial pipeline is evidenced by material prospects - in LNG  carbon capture and other key markets - that are progressing towards investment decisions in 2024.”“Our priorities for 2024 are to strengthen our leadership in low-carbon LNG and net zero solutions  to build proprietary technology demonstration projects in decarbonization and circularity  and to form strategic partnerships crucial to fast-track deployment of clean tech solutions at commercial scale.”“Scaling clean energy technologies and emissions abatement are new demands being placed on producers and industries to drive sustainable development. For this  Technip Energies is the technology and industrial partner of choice.”“To respond to the scale of the Net Zero challenge  together  we must rise to the challenge of scale.”Key financials – adjusted IFRS(In € millions  except EPS and %) FY 2023 FY 2022 Revenue 6 014.7 6 424.4 Recurring EBIT 445.1 451.1 Recurring EBIT margin % 7.4% 7.0% Net profit 294.1 320.2 Diluted earnings per share(1) €1.63 €1.79 Order intake 10 070.1 3 844.8 Backlog 15 713.3 12 750.1 Financial information is presented under adjusted IFRS (see Appendix 8.0 for complete definition).

Adjusted order intake in the fourth quarter amounted to €562 million  which included a proprietary technology  engineering  and procurement services contract for Dow’s net-zero integrated ethylene cracker in Canada as well as other studies  services contracts and smaller projects.The first nine months included a major LNG contract for the North Field South Project by QatarEnergy  a significant ethylene proprietary equipment contract for QatarEnergy and CPChem’s Ras Laffan petrochemicals complex in Qatar  a significant contract for the electric-driven Xi’An LNG project in China  a FEED for Calpine’s carbon capture project in Texas  US  a FEED for the world’s largest low-carbon hydrogen project at ExxonMobil’s Baytown facility in Texas  US  a significant contract for a hydrogen production unit at bp’s Kwinana biorefinery in Australia  two EPsCm contracts for an advanced biofuels unit and a green hydrogen unit for Galp in its Sines refinery in Portugal  a PMC contract with Aramco for the master planning of Ras Al Khair  a new industrial city in Saudi Arabia  as well as other studies  services contracts and smaller projects.Adjusted backlog increased by 23% year-over-year to €15.7 billion  equivalent to 2.6x 2023 full year revenue. Adjusted backlog in the fourth quarter was impacted by three factors beyond foreign exchange: (1) the cancellation of a large EPC contract by Hafslund Oslo Celsio; (2) an adjustment to long lead items on recently awarded LNG projects; and (3) a technical reduction associated with variable consideration  which may reverse in the future. In aggregate  these factors led to a negative backlog adjustment of €861.6 million. In addition  Adjusted backlog was negatively impacted by foreign exchange of €230.6 million.(In € millions) FY 2023 FY 2022 Adjusted order intake 10 070.1 3 844.8 Project Delivery 8 311.5 1 682.1 Technology  Products & Services 1 758.6 2 162.8 Adjusted backlog 15 713.3 12 750.1 Project Delivery 13 884.1 10 727.9 Technology  Products & Services 1 829.2 2 022.2 Reconciliation of IFRS to non-IFRS financial measures are provided in appendices.Adjusted backlog at December 31  2023  has been impacted negatively by foreign exchange of €230.6 million.The table below provides estimated backlog scheduling as of December 31  2023.(In € millions) FY 2024 FY 2025 FY 2026+ Adjusted backlog 5 097.0 4 070.3 6 546.0Company financial performanceAdjusted statement of income(In € millions  except %) FY 2023 FY 2022 % Change Adjusted revenue 6 014.7 6 424.4 (6)% Adjusted EBITDA 540.4 560.2 (4) % Adjusted recurring EBIT 445.1 451.1 (1)% Non-recurring items (45.0) (1.4) N/A EBIT 400.1 449.7 (11) % Financial income (expense)  net 86.2 15.5 N/A Profit (loss) before income tax 486.3 465.2 5% Income tax (expense) profit (145.4) (131.5) 11% Net profit (loss) 340.9 333.7 2 % Net profit (loss) attributable to Technip Energies Group 294.1 320.2 (8) % Net profit (loss) attributable to non-controlling interests 46.8 13.5 N/ABusiness highlightsProject Delivery – adjusted IFRS(In € millions  except % and bps) FY 2023 FY 2022 % Change Revenue 4 078.2 5 023.9 (19) % Recurring EBIT 318.1 396.0 (20) % Recurring EBIT margin % 7.8% 7.9% -10 bps Financial information is presented under adjusted IFRS (see Appendix 8.0 for complete definition).FY 2023 Adjusted revenue decreased by 19% year-over-year to €4 078.2 million. The continued ramp-up of activity on Qatar NFE  an initial contribution from Qatar NFS  and good volumes in downstream projects  including ethylene  were more than offset by significantly lower revenue contribution from LNG projects in Russia following the completion of the warranty phase on Yamal LNG in 2022 and the orderly exit from Arctic LNG 2.FY 2023 Adjusted recurring EBIT decreased by 20% year-over-year to €318.1 million  broadly in line with the reduction in revenue. FY 2023 Adjusted recurring EBIT margin decreased slightly year-over-year by 10 bps to 7.8%  but remained close to historic high levels due to continued strong execution on late stage LNG and downstream projects  and favorable project close outs.Q4 2023 Key operational milestones(Please refer to Q1 2023  H1 2023 and 9M 2023 press releases for first nine months milestones)Qatar Energy North Field Expansion (Qatar)Shipment and delivery of all essential LNG equipment  and primary mechanical equipment installed.

Technip Energies provided an Extended Basic Engineering Package for this new ethylene plant  including the cracking furnaces and the downstream separation section. This is the first ethylene plant worldwide to be designed to achieve net-zero CO 2 emissions.Corporate and other itemsCorporate costs  excluding non-recurring items  were €59.3 million for the full year 2023  higher than the underlying run-rate in 2022 due to costs associated with the employee share offering (“ESOP 2023”)  as well as incremental costs associated with strategic projects and pre-development initiatives.Non-recurring expense amounted to €45.0 million  relating to three main factors: the settlement with the French Parquet National Financier (PNF) announced on June 27  2023  the non-cash impact of the cumulative translation adjustment (CTA) as part of the deconsolidation of our main Russian operating entity  and costs incurred related to strategic developments.Net financial income of €86.2 million benefited from higher rates of interest income generated from cash and cash equivalents  partially offset by interest expenses associated with the senior unsecured notes and the mark-to-market valuation impact of investments in traded securities.Effective tax rate on an adjusted IFRS basis was 29.9% for the full year 2023  consistent with the top-end of the 2023 guidance range of 26% - 30%. The slight increase in the effective tax rate year-over-year is explained by non-recurring expenses disallowed for tax purposes.Depreciation and amortization expense was €95.3 million  of which €65.9 million is related to IFRS 16.Adjusted net cash at December 31  2023 was €2.8 billion  which compares to €3.1 billion at December 31  2022.Adjusted free cash flow was €212.5 million for the full year 2023. Adjusted free cash flow  excluding the working capital variance of €330.5 million  was €543.0 million benefiting from strong operational performance and consistently high conversion from Adjusted recurring EBIT. Free cash flow is stated after capital expenditures of €48.5 million. Adjusted operating cash flow was €261.0 million.LiquidityAdjusted liquidity of €4.2 billion at December 31  2023 comprised of €3.6 billion of cash and €750 million of liquidity provided by the Company’s undrawn revolving credit facility  offset by €80 million of outstanding commercial paper. The Company’s revolving credit facility is available for general use and serves as a backstop for the Company’s commercial paper program.Shareholder returnsThe Company is committed to delivering long term sustainable growth and attractive returns to shareholders through a balanced approach to capital allocation.

The maximum number of shares that can be acquired under the share buyback program is 5 million shares. The share buyback program will be carried out until December 31  2024.ESG roadmap and scorecardThe Company made significant progress towards achieving its targets. On our Climate & Environment pillar  scope 1 & 2 emissions were reduced by 28% compared to 2021 thanks to the Company’s 5-point action plan to reduce energy the carbon footprint of our offices and industrial sites.

The severity of our incidents have decreased by 72% compared to 2022 and our TRIR (Total Recordable Incident Rate) is amongst the lowest in the industry  reflecting the impact of the Pulse HSE safety program which saw over 9 000 participants in 2023.T.EN considers Diversity and Inclusion as a business imperative and we continue to improve our workforce diversity and cultivate behavioral change to boost innovation and collaboration and to deliver tangible results of gender representation at all levels.

In conversation with stakeholders and the Building Responsibly association  Technip Energies has developed a series of worker welfare guidance notes which form the basis of its Human Rights Policy which is adopted across our operations. In November  Technip Energies held its inaugural ESG Supplier Council during which the Company rolled out a supplier and subcontractor sustainability assessment program and pushed for alignment on the importance of collaboration and engagement  including through human rights due diligence.All these achievements are thanks to the drive and commitment of all Technip Energies employees  and they reflect the progress that can be made through working together towards shared goals.Sustainability goes beyond reporting what Technip Energies does right. It is a way of thinking and doing that drives the Company’s activity  the way it does business and develops new offers  with a wider definition of value for the planet and people.
