36865,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rt.com/business/593558-us-g7-russia-frozen-assets-confiscation/,US pushing G7 members to devise ways to tap Russian frozen assets,US and its allies are looking for a “firm” legal rationale for them to confiscate frozen Russian assets  the US Treasury Secretary has said Read Full Article at RT.com,Western allies are looking for “viable” options to expropriate the funds  US Treasury Secretary Yellen has saidThe US and its allies will continue to seek a “firm” legal rationale to underpin plans to confiscate Russia's assets abroad  US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told Reuters on Thursday.Yellen said that any such action would need an airtight legal basis  shortly after a meeting of the Group of Twenty finance ministers in Brazil  during which she failed to seal a deal to aid Kiev using Russian funds.She noted that despite skepticism from some EU countries about asset seizure  there were ways to tap the $300 billion belonging to the Russian central bank  such as using the funds as collateral for loans. Yellen also mentioned a new proposal to issue a syndicated loan  which she described as an “interesting option.”“There are complicated legal issues here. We agree that whatever we do has to have a firm international legal  as well as domestic rationale ” Yellen said.While the US and UK have been pushing for actions to outright seize these funds  the EU has been warning about the legal and financial implications of such a move.At the meeting in Sao Paulo on Wednesday French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire publicly questioned Yellen’s view that it would be legal to tap Russian funds  revealing a rift among G7 countries.Arguing that the West doesn’t have the “legal basis to seize the Russian assets now ” Le Maire called for a more modest approach  centered on the EU’s moves to seize the interest earned from the assets held at the clearinghouse Euroclear.Echoing his remarks  German Finance Minister Christian Lindner said that the EU was looking into “a legally secure step” to use proceeds from frozen Russian assets.France and Germany  along with the European Central Bank  have expressed most concern that seizing the funds could negatively affect financial stability and erode trust in the euro’s status as a reserve currency.It’s also argued that such a drastic move would set a precedent  pushing other countries to avoid holding their reserves in Western currencies in case they may one day become subject to similar sanctions.While admitting it was critical not to put at risk the work of Euroclear  which holds most of the Russian sovereign funds  Yellen said she challenged Le Maire to help develop the workarounds sought by G7 leaders in time for their June summit in Italy.She added that G7 members had urged their staff “to come up with as many viable options as we can  and to analyze both the benefits and costs associated with them.”Moscow warned it would respond in kind if the West went through with threats to confiscate Russian assets. In a recent interview Finance Minister Anton Siluanov noted that Western states themselves still have equivalent assets in Russia that could be jeopardized if the frozen funds belonging to Russia are tapped.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section,neutral,0.05,0.69,0.26,negative,0.04,0.32,0.64,True,English,"['Russian frozen assets', 'G7 members', 'ways', 'French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire', 'German Finance Minister Christian Lindner', 'US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen', 'Finance Minister Anton Siluanov', 'US Treasury Secretary Yellen', 'Twenty finance ministers', 'European Central Bank', 'complicated legal issues', 'firm international legal', 'Russian central bank', 'firm” legal rationale', 'airtight legal basis', 'many viable options', 'Russian sovereign funds', 'frozen Russian assets', 'viable” options', 'The US', 'domestic rationale', 'frozen funds', 'Russian funds', 'asset seizure', 'new proposal', 'syndicated loan', 'interesting option', 'financial implications', 'Sao Paulo', 'G7 countries', 'modest approach', 'secure step', 'most concern', 'financial stability', 'reserve currency', 'other countries', 'Western currencies', 'similar sanctions', 'G7 leaders', 'June summit', 'G7 members', 'recent interview', 'Western states', 'business section', 'equivalent assets', 'Western allies', 'drastic move', 'EU countries', 'plans', 'Reuters', 'Thursday', 'action', 'meeting', 'Group', 'Brazil', 'deal', 'Kiev', 'skepticism', 'ways', 'collateral', 'loans', 'UK', 'Wednesday', 'rift', 'moves', 'clearinghouse', 'Euroclear', 'remarks', 'proceeds', 'France', 'Germany', 'trust', 'status', 'precedent', 'reserves', 'case', 'risk', 'work', 'time', 'Italy', 'staff', 'benefits', 'costs', 'Moscow', 'kind', 'threats', 'stories', 'economy']",2024-03-01,2024-03-02,rt.com
36866,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rt.com/news/593482-biden-russian-assets-june/,Biden eyes June deadline for plan on Russian assets – Bloomberg,US President Joe Biden is looking for progress on using Russian funds for Ukraine by the June meeting of G7 leaders  Bloomberg has reported Read Full Article at RT.com,EU leaders are reluctant to seize the frozen billions  fearing retaliation and damage to the euroPresident Joe Biden is pushing his fellow Group of Seven (G7) leaders to make progress on a plan to use frozen Russian assets to fund Kiev by the time they meet in June  Bloomberg reported on Thursday  citing people familiar with the matter.While the UK and Canada both advocate the seizure of blocked Russian sovereign assets to further fund Ukraine’s military and its reconstruction  France and Germany both have reservations.Most of Russia's assets are located in the EU  primarily at the Belgium-based clearing house Euroclear. Making too strong a move without legal justification may undermine the euro’s status as a reserve currency and do other harm to the bloc's reputation  leading members fear  according to Bloomberg.There is also the threat of a response by Moscow. Russia has condemned the freezing of approximately $300 billion of its national wealth as illegal  and has warned that any move to confiscate the money would be criminal.Last month  the European Council took measures aimed at imposing a windfall tax on profits generated by the Russian funds and sending proceeds to Ukraine. The Russian Foreign Ministry said Brussels was trying to “create the illusion of legitimacy over attacks on our property and thereby camouflage what is in fact outright theft.”There are Western assets of similar value under Russian jurisdiction  which can be targeted in retaliation  Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said in an interview last week.“This is not a question for us; we are following the decisions of Western countries ” he stated. “Any actions with our assets will receive a symmetrical response.” Other global players have been closely watching the developments and have adjusted their policies accordingly  the minister noted.For example  the Chinese  whose foreign reserves exceed $3 trillion  according to the State Administration of Foreign Exchange  “are reducing their exposure to American securities” as a consequence.EU nations are reportedly considering other options for making frozen Russian assets play in Ukraine’s favor without resorting to an outright seizure. For example  they could be offered as collateral to lenders for money borrowed on Kiev’s behalf.Ultimately Western nations want Moscow to willingly pay damages to Kiev for the Ukraine conflict  before restoring its control over Russian assets.,neutral,0.02,0.97,0.01,negative,0.02,0.19,0.79,True,English,"['June deadline', 'Russian assets', 'Biden', 'plan', 'Bloomberg', 'Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov', 'The Russian Foreign Ministry', 'President Joe Biden', 'Belgium-based clearing house', 'Seven (G7) leaders', 'Other global players', 'Russian sovereign assets', 'frozen Russian assets', 'Russian funds', 'Russian jurisdiction', 'frozen billions', 'foreign reserves', 'Foreign Exchange', 'other harm', 'other options', 'EU leaders', 'Western assets', 'fellow Group', 'legal justification', 'reserve currency', 'leading members', 'national wealth', 'European Council', 'windfall tax', 'outright theft', 'similar value', 'Western countries', 'State Administration', 'American securities', 'Western nations', 'EU nations', 'symmetrical response', 'outright seizure', 'Ukraine conflict', 'retaliation', 'damage', 'progress', 'plan', 'Kiev', 'time', 'June', 'Bloomberg', 'Thursday', 'people', 'matter', 'Canada', 'military', 'reconstruction', 'France', 'Germany', 'reservations', 'Euroclear', 'strong', 'move', 'status', 'bloc', 'reputation', 'threat', 'Moscow', 'freezing', 'money', 'measures', 'profits', 'proceeds', 'Brussels', 'illusion', 'legitimacy', 'attacks', 'property', 'fact', 'interview', 'question', 'decisions', 'actions', 'developments', 'policies', 'example', 'Chinese', 'exposure', 'consequence', 'favor', 'collateral', 'lenders', 'behalf', 'control']",2024-03-01,2024-03-02,rt.com

Yorkville no longer owns any convertible notes (obligations convertible en actions “OCA”) or other dilutive variable price-products*.Since its arrival on June 5  2023  management has expressed its desire to end the company’s historical reliance on variable pricing financial instruments such as those that were in place for many years between Yorkville and the company  then known as Delta Drone  prior to management’s arrival.All obligations to Yorkville have now been satisfied by (i) the company making the final payment due to Yorkville under the terms of the Share Purchase Agreement (“SPA”) that were announced in the company’s press release of 27 June 20231; and (ii) an investor purchasing from Yorkville the 23 000 OCA issued on 5 June 2023 and modified as announced in the company’s press release of 15 November 2023.2 Satisfying all of these obligations with Yorkville is a significant milestone in Tonner Drones eliminating these variable pricing financial instruments  as it continues its financial restructuring and refinancing endeavors.Tonner Drones is pleased that an investor provided the funding to ensure the final payment to Yorkville under the SPA. In addition  discussions are ongoing with the investor that purchased the OCA to restructure or end them as well.Tonner Drones recently published their semi-annual accounts3 and was released from the Euronext penalty bench.4 Coupled with management’s financial restructuring and cost reduction initiatives over the past eight months  these significant developments now allow management to focus their time and resources on growing the company’s drone and drone-related technology business  particularly in the military and defense markets.*This will be effective once Yorkville has received the full payment  which will be processed in the coming days.About Tonner Drones : Tonner Drones (formerly Delta Drone) develops UAVs and associated technologies for the defense and homeland security sectors. Tonner Drones holds valuable stakes in some of France's leading civilian and military drone manufacturers. Tonner Drones’ strategy is to leverage its shareholdings in these companies through active asset management  a private equity fund  and by teaming up with other private equity funds to become a significant industry consolidator. Additional revenues can be achieved through royalties from patents held by Tonner Drones to recognized manufacturers. Tonner Drones does not plan on owning a factory; however  it is determined to retain R&D for its products and systems in France.Tonner Drones’ shares are listed on Euronext Growth Paris (ISIN code: FR001400H2X4).More information at www.tonnerdrones.comIf you would like to find out more  or if you are interested in a partnership: contact@tonnerdrones.comContactActifinJean-Yves BARBARAFinancial communicationjean-yves.barbara@seitosei-actifin.com+33 (0)1 56 88 11 13 ActifinAmélie OrioPress Relationsamelie.orio@seitosei-actifin.com+33 (0)1 56 88 11 161https://tonnerdrones.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/DeltaDrone_CP_DeltaDrone_Yorkville_27.06.2023_EN__VD.pdf2https://tonnerdrones.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/2023-11-15_Avenant-accord-OCA-Tonner-Drones-et-Yorkville_EN.pdf.3 https://tonnerdrones.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/TONNER-DRONES-UK.pdf4 https://tonnerdrones.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/TonnerDrones-leaves-penalty-bench-VD.pdfAttachment,neutral,0.01,0.98,0.0,positive,0.71,0.27,0.01,True,English,"['Convertible Note Relationship', 'Tonner Drones', 'Yorkville', 'Amélie Orio Press Relations', 'other private equity funds', 'variable pricing financial instruments', 'Share Purchase Agreement', 'Euronext penalty bench', 'cost reduction initiatives', 'past eight months', 'drone-related technology business', 'homeland security sectors', 'Euronext Growth Paris', 'Convertible Note Relationship', 'significant industry consolidator', 'active asset management', 'Tonner Drones’ strategy', 'military drone manufacturers', 'press release', 'financial restructuring', 'Financial communication', 'convertible notes', 'significant milestone', 'significant developments', 'historical reliance', 'many years', 'Delta Drone', 'final payment', 'refinancing endeavors', 'semi-annual accounts3', 'full payment', 'coming days', 'associated technologies', 'valuable stakes', 'leading civilian', 'Additional revenues', 'R&D', 'ISIN code', 'More information', 'defense markets', 'Jean-Yves BARBARA', 'Yorkville Advisors', 'Cannes', 'March', 'FR001400H2X4', 'ALTD', 'company', 'obligations', 'actions', 'OCA', 'arrival', 'June', 'desire', 'place', 'terms', 'SPA', 'investor', '15 November', 'funding', 'discussions', 'time', 'resources', 'UAVs', 'France', 'shareholdings', 'companies', 'royalties', 'patents', 'factory', 'products', 'systems', 'shares', 'tonnerdrones', 'partnership', 'Contact', 'Actifin', 'seitosei', 'amelie', 'uploads', 'DeltaDrone_CP_DeltaDrone_Yorkville', 'Avenant', 'accord', 'TONNER-DRONES', 'UK', 'penalty-bench-VD', 'Attachment']",2024-03-01,2024-03-02,globenewswire.com

Excluding Aegide International  growth was 29.3%  confirming the recovery in activity after a first half of 2023 marked by the very weak performance of DOLFINES SA.The activities of DOLFINES SA (Conventional Energies Division) suffered in the 1st half (-49%) from a shortening of the duration of inspection contracts from one semester to the next  as well as from delays and cancellations of inspection contracts awarded in Kuwait and India and the departure of several team members at the beginning of the year.This delay was only partially offset in the second half of the year by the signing of new firm contracts in Brazil  the Gulf of Mexico and Malaysia  as well as in Egypt and West Africa. For the year as a whole  the decline in activity was 18.5%.8.2 France saw its business grow by 17.1% to €3.63 million for the year as a whole. After a stable first half of the year  activity accelerated significantly in the second half of the year (+35% year-on-half) thanks to the signing of several QA/QC contracts on the Fécamp offshore wind farm construction project and at the offshore wind turbine platform manufacturing plants in Saint Nazaire and Le Havre.AEGIDE international  an international expertise company in the EHS (Environment  Health and Safety) market  was integrated on May 1  2023.

The Ad-Hoc Committee sought further clarification from the interested party to assess whether it could constitute an alternative to the Bidco offer on improved financial terms. The interested party has indicated that it thinks it could value Believe shares at least at 17 euro per share  restating that at this stage its approach did not constitute an offer or constitute any obligation to make an offer  nor did it evidence an intention to make an offer.The Ad-hoc Committee notes that the completion of the Block Acquisitions would put BidCo in a position of majority control of Believe  so that  under those circumstances  it would prevent a competing bidder from acquiring control.The Ad-Hoc Committee will examine with the interested party whether such party envisages further steps.The Ad-Hoc Committee will continue to perform its mission and keep the market informed in accordance with applicable rules.*****About BelieveBelieve is one of the world’s leading digital music companies.

Full-year 2023 operating result of EUR 1 498 million  a decrease of 17% from EUR 1 802 million in 2022Shareholders’ equity reduces by EUR 0.7 billion to EUR 7.5 billion following EUR 1.1 billion capital returns. Shareholders’ equity per share remains stable at EUR 4.27Capital generation  cash and capital managementOperating capital generation before holding funding and operating expenses increases by 16% compared with the second half of 2022 to EUR 660 million and to EUR 1 280 million for the full-yearCapital ratios remain robust  above their respective operating levelsCash Capital at Holding at EUR 2.4 billion. EUR 829 million of the announced EUR 1.5 billion share buyback completed at year-end; reduced financial leverage to target level of around EUR 5 billionFree Cash Flow of EUR 429 million includes special dividend from Aegon AM of EUR 75 million; full-year Free Cash Flow of EUR 715 million exceeds guidance of around EUR 600 millionProposed final 2023 dividend of EUR 0.16 per common share  bringing the full-year dividend to EUR 0.30 per common share  up 30% versus the full-year 2022 dividendLard Friese  Aegon CEO  commented:“The second half of 2023 saw Aegon maintain commercial momentum  driven by the strong performance of our US business  Transamerica  as well as our UK workplace business and our joint venture in Brazil. Aegon’s operating capital generation (OCG) from the units of EUR 660 million was solid during the period  bringing the total OCG for 2023 to EUR 1 280 million  exceeding the initial guidance for the year. Our business units remained well capitalized and our holding cash position continued to be robust. Free cash flow amounted to EUR 429 million for the second half of 2023  contributing to a total of EUR 715 million for the year  enabling us to exceed our guidance of EUR 600 million. The IFRS operating result of EUR 681 million was lower than in the second half of 2022  reflecting one-time benefits in 2022 that did not recur in 2023  as well as the impact of announced management actions in 2023. The contrasting trend in our IFRS results compared to our OCG results is caused by differences in the timing of recognition of earnings between the two frameworks. OCG continues to be the primary lens by which we evaluate business performance and steer the company.At our Capital Markets Day (CMD) in June of last year  we announced Transamerica’s strategy to become America’s leading middle market life insurance and retirement company. In 2023  Transamerica again delivered a strong performance. The Individual Solutions business generated new life sales of USD 486 million  an increase of 13% compared with the prior year and the highest sales level in the past eight years. The number of agents at World Financial Group (WFG) grew by 18% compared with a year earlier to almost 74 000. Written sales of mid-sized plans for our Workplace Solutions business amounted to USD 6.7 billion  an increase of 72% compared with the prior year. This was driven by growth in sales of both single employer plans and pooled plans. Meanwhile  we continued to actively manage our Financial Assets  including recent actions to reduce the exposure of Transamerica’s capital ratio to equity market movements.Our UK Workplace platform also performed well. Despite the loss of a large  low margin pension scheme in the third quarter  we reported positive net inflows for 2023 and expect continued net inflows as a result of the onboarding of new schemes and higher net deposits on existing schemes.At the same time  both Aegon’s UK Retail platform and asset management business experienced net outflows as they were adversely affected by the macro-economic environment in 2023.Moving to our insurance joint ventures: in Brazil  new life sales at Mongeral Aegon Group increased by 37% to EUR 144 million reflecting both business growth and Aegon’s increased economic stake  while new life sales in China increased by 19% to EUR 103 million in 2023.We have completed 76% of our current EUR 1.5 billion share buyback program (on February 23  2023) and we have executed upon our planned de-leveraging. We have proposed a final dividend of 16 eurocents per share. On this basis  the total dividend paid for the full-year 2023 will be 30 eurocents  in line with our target and up 30% compared with 2022.I am very proud of everything the teams have achieved in 2023  and I am grateful for all their work during another transformational year. We will continue to work hard executing our strategy in 2024. Our strong commercial performance  together with the important steps we took to realign our company  have given us a solid foundation on which to sustainably grow our dividend per share. We also look forward to presenting the strategy for our UK business in more depth during a teach-in session on June 25 this year.”Please note that all comparisons are versus the second half of 2022 unless stated otherwise.Additional informationPresentationThe conference call presentation is available on aegon.com as of 7.00 am CET.SupplementsAegon’s second half 2023 Financial Supplement and other supplementary documents are available on aegon.com .Conference call including Q&AThe conference call starts at 9:00 am CET  with an audio webcast on aegon.com.

In addition  we initiated a substantial strategic shift in our operations in China which is already contributing meaningfully to improved Group results. While these major projects were being executed  we delivered the Group’s best results in nearly 15 years. We have reduced our net debt by €560 million versus the year-end 2022 level  and by over €900 million versus the third quarter 2022 peak. I would like to thank the entire Vallourec team for their hard work towards achieving these results.“Today  we are well advanced in our plans to deliver best-in-class profitability and cycle-proof our business. Yet  we still see further opportunities ahead. In 2024  we plan to deliver further improvements in our operations in Brazil to fully capitalize on our premier asset base in the country. Globally  we remain intensely focused on cost control and disciplined capital allocation.“The overall market remains conducive to our efforts to generate strong cash flows and deleverage our balance sheet. In the US  the rig count has slightly increased since October 2023  imports remain suppressed  and distributor inventories continue to fall. We expect pricing in the region to stabilize imminently.“Outside of the US  we continue to experience demand in excess of our capacity and see strong prices in our new orders. Notwithstanding recent market concerns  we believe the demand environment in the Middle East is among the best we have seen in years. We continue to see a multi-year activity upturn mainly led by major customer drilling programs in Saudi Arabia  the UAE and Iraq. Our commercial intimacy with our customers as well as our local value-added facilities give us comfort that this region should contribute significantly to our results in the coming years.“We are well on track to reach zero net debt by year-end 2025 at the latest.

The decrease in Group revenues reflects:(26%) volume decrease mainly driven by lower deliveries in Industry in Europe and Oil & Gas Tubes in North America10% price/mix effect1% Mine and Forest effect(3%) currency effect mainly related to the strengthening of the Euro versus the US dollarIn Q4 2023  EBITDA amounted to €280 million  or 21.9% of revenues  compared to €312 million (20.3% of revenues) in Q4 2022. The decrease was largely driven by lower average selling prices in Tubes in North America  offset by improved Tubes results outside of North America.In Q4 2023  Vallourec recorded a €153 million income related to the reversal of previously-booked impairments. This reversal largely reflects an improved near-term earnings outlook in Eastern Hemisphere. This improvement  to be realized over the coming years  is due both to the successful results of the Group’s restructuring efforts in Asia  including the premiumization strategy executed in China  as well as a favorable medium-term price outlook. In Q4 2022  the Group recorded a (€36) million impairment charge primarily related to assets in Europe.In Q4 2023  Vallourec recorded a (€185) million charge predominantly related to its restructuring efforts in Germany. The largest component of this charge is a (€127) million expense related to the Group’s ongoing supply agreement with its legacy steel supplier in Germany  HKM. As disclosed in its 2022 Universal Registration Document  Vallourec has terminated its long-term supply agreement with HKM in conjunction with the shutdown of its German rolling mills. Vallourec’s remaining obligation under its supply agreement will therefore end in 2028 following the 7-year contractual notice period. Vallourec has been reselling excess steel products (largely slabs) throughout 2023  but currently expects these operations to be somewhat loss-making over the remainder of the contract. The €127 million liability is related to the expected negative cash flows to be spread over the next five years. Vallourec continues to pursue various means of improving the cash flow profile of this supply agreement.As a result of the above factors  operating income was €198 million  compared to €164 million in Q4 2022.Financial income (loss) was positive at €26 million  compared to (€60) million in Q4 2022. Net interest expense in Q4 2023 was (€14) million compared to (€25) million in Q4 2022. In Q4 2023  financial income was supported by a €40 million settlement of a longstanding dispute in Brazil with one of the Company’s electricity suppliers.Income tax amounted to (€102) million compared to (€9) million in Q4 2022. This increase was largely driven by significantly higher earnings before tax. The effective tax rate was impacted by non-tax-deductible tax losses in Germany.This resulted in positive net income  Group share  of €105 million  compared to €78 million in Q4 2022.Earnings per diluted share was to €0.44  versus €0.34 in Q4 2022. The increase reflects the above changes in net income as well as an increase in potentially dilutive shares largely related to the Company’s outstanding warrants  which are accounted for using the treasury share method.Full Year Results AnalysisOver the full year 2023  Vallourec recorded revenues of €5 114 million  up 5% year-on-year (+6% at constant exchange rates). The increase in Group revenues reflects:(14%) volume decrease predominantly due to lower deliveries in Industry in Europe18% price/mix effect2% Mine and Forest effect(2%) currency effect mainly related to the strengthening of the Euro versus the US dollarFor FY 2023  EBITDA amounted to €1 196 million  or 23.4% of revenues  compared to €715 million (14.6% of revenues) for FY 2022. The increase was driven by substantially higher Tubes EBITDA due to favorable pricing in North America in H1 2023  and steadily improving Tubes results outside of North America  particularly in H2 2023.FY 2023 operating income was positive at €859 million  versus the (€122) million loss incurred in 2022. Vallourec recorded a net €145 million impairment reversal  offset by (€279) million in charges largely related to the costs of executing the New Vallourec plan. In 2022  Vallourec’s operating income was burdened by (€574) million of charges largely related to the costs of executing the New Vallourec plan.Financial income (loss) was (€66) million in FY 2023  compared to (€111) million in 2022. Net interest expense in FY 2023 was (€88) million compared to (€95) million in FY 2022. FY 2023 financial income (loss) benefitted from the previously-discussed €40 million settlement amount in Q4 2023.Income tax amounted to (€269) million in FY 2023 compared to (€113) million in FY 2022. The increase was attributable to higher profits in most regions and the exhaustion of net operating losses in North America. The effective tax rate was elevated due to non-tax-deductible losses in Germany.This resulted in positive FY 2023 net income  Group share  of €496 million  compared to (€366) million in FY 2022.Earnings per diluted share amounted to €2.07  versus a (€1.60) loss in FY 2022. The increase reflects the above changes in net income as well as an increase in potentially dilutive shares largely related to the company’s outstanding warrants  which are accounted for using the treasure share method.RESULTS ANALYSIS BY SEGMENTFourth Quarter Results AnalysisTubes: In Q4 2023  Tubes revenues were down 18% YoY due to a 26% reduction in shipments  offset by a 10% increase in average selling price. This decrease in shipments was largely attributable to the closure of Vallourec’s German rolling operations as a result of the New Vallourec plan. Tubes EBITDA decreased from €285 million in Q4 2022 to €249 million due to decreases in profitability in North America offset by improvements in the rest of the world.Mine & Forest: In Q4 2023  iron ore production sold reached 1.7 million tonnes  increasing by 20% year-over-year but down slightly sequentially. In Q4 2023  Mine & Forest EBITDA reached €43 million  versus €22 million in Q4 2022  reflecting favorable iron ore prices offset by somewhat higher costs.Full Year Results AnalysisTubes: In FY 2023  Tubes revenues were up 3% YoY  which reflected a 14% reduction in shipments offset by a 20% increase in average selling price. These results reflected the closure of Vallourec’s German rolling operations as well as the implementation of the Value over Volume strategy. Tubes EBITDA increased from €638 million in FY 2022 to €1 051 million due to a favorable market pricing environment and the execution of the New Vallourec plan.Mine & Forest: In FY 2023  iron ore production sold reached 6.9 million tonnes  increasing by 71% year-over-year due to the recovery in volumes following the waste pile slippage experienced at the mine in 2022. In FY 2023  Mine & Forest EBITDA reached €180 million versus €113 million in FY 2022  reflecting a strong volume recovery offset by higher costs.CASH FLOW AND FINANCIAL POSITIONFourth Quarter Cash Flow AnalysisIn Q4 2023  adjusted operating cash flow was €226 million versus €213 million in Q4 2022. The increase was driven by lower financial cash out which was positively impacted by the €40 million settlement discussed above  which offset lower EBITDA and higher taxes.Adjusted free cash flow was €275 million  versus €318 million in Q4 2022. Higher adjusted operating cash flow was more than offset by a smaller working capital release versus the prior year period.Total cash generation in Q4 2023 was €149 million  versus €323 million in Q4 2022  due largely to €193 million of restructuring charges and non-recurring items. These expected cash headwinds were primarily related to severance and restructuring costs in Germany.Full Year Cash Flow AnalysisIn FY 2023  adjusted operating cash flow was €928 million versus €458 million in FY2022. The increase was driven largely by higher EBITDA generation.Adjusted free cash flow was €860 million in 2023  versus (€88) million in FY 2022. In addition to higher EBITDA  Vallourec saw a working capital release of €145 million as compared to a (€355) million cash use for working capital in 2022.Total cash generation in FY 2023 was €568 million  versus (€200) million in FY 2022. This increase  driven by higher EBITDA and a working capital release  was offset by a (€362) million cash headwind for restructuring charges & non-recurring items related primarily to the closure of the Company’s German rolling operations and the global implementation of the New Vallourec plan.Net Debt and LiquidityAs of December 31  2023  net debt stood at €570 million  a significant decrease compared to €1 130 million on December 31  2022. Gross debt amounted to €1 470 million including €49 million of fair value adjustment under IFRS 9 which will be reversed over the life of the debt. Gross debt decreased over the course of 2023 due to the reduction of ACC ACE financing in Brazil. Long-term debt amounted to €1 348 million and short-term debt totaled €122 million.As of December 31  2023  the liquidity position was very strong at €1 539 million  with cash amounting to €900 million  availability on our revolving credit facility (RCF) of €462 million  and availability on an asset-backed loan (ABL) of €177 million (c). The Group has no long-term debt repayments scheduled before June 2026.THE NEW VALLOUREC PLANThe New Vallourec plan  announced in May 2022  has been fully implemented  giving birth to a new Vallourec. As planned  we shut down our German operations  and the majority of the affiliated staff has now departed the company. A team remains for dismantling operations in 2024. The land related to one of the two primary production facilities in Germany (Mülheim) was sold at the end of 2023. The sale of the site related to the second primary production facility (Duesseldorf-Rath) remains in progress. The capability enhancement program in Brazil  which enabled the transfer of Oil & Gas production from Germany  is completed. We also executed the planned worldwide overhead cost reduction program.These actions will generate a €230 million recurring EBITDA uplift versus 2021 and an approximately €20 million capex reduction. We have therefore substantially progressed the goals of making the Group cycle-proof and generating positive free cash flowd  excluding changes in working capital  even at the bottom of the cycle.We have also continuously broadened the scope of the New Vallourec plan to drive meaningful operational and profitability improvements. In China  we initiated a meaningful premiumization strategy in 2023 that has already begun to contribute to our results. EBITDA margins in that production hub are expected to converge towards Group average. In Saudi Arabia  we have executed a regional capacity expansion to capitalize on the strong demand environment in the region.As we move into 2024  we continue to identify potential operational enhancements globally. In particular  we see outsized opportunity to deliver higher profitability from our Brazilian production hub. Beyond this  we will capitalize on opportunities to grow our New Energies business and our high-margin services & accessories revenue streams. Finally  in 2024  we will further progress on our path towards net debt zero  ultimately reaching this level by year-end 2025 at the latest.FIRST HALF AND FULL YEAR 2024 OUTLOOKEIn the first half of 2024  based on our assumptions and current market conditions  Vallourec expects:Group EBITDA to be broadly similar to second half 2023 EBITDA of €502m  driven by: A slight decline in international Tubes volumes due to the closure of Vallourec’s operations in Germany  offset by improved international pricing Moderating declines in US Tubes pricing  offset by improving US sales volumes Iron ore production sold of approximately 3 million tonnes  with mine costs remaining elevatedTotal cash generation be positiveNet debt to decline further versus the year-end 2023 level  starting in the first quarterFor the full year 2024  based on our assumptions and current market conditions  Vallourec expects:Another year of strong EBITDA generation  driven by: Continued strong performance in Tubes  due to robust pricing in backlog and further operational improvement Iron ore production sold of approximately 6 million tonnes  with mine costs remaining elevatedTotal cash generation to be positiveNet debt to decline further versus the year-end 2023 level  starting in the first quarterKey items affecting Vallourec’s cash flow in 2024 are expected to be as follows:Financial cash out is expected to be approximately (€100) millionTax payments are expected to reflect a mid to high 20% cash tax rate relative to reported pre-tax incomeCapital expenditures are expected to be approximately (€200) millionRestructuring charges and non-recurring items are expected to represent a cash use of approximately (€200) million.

It corresponds to net cash used in operating activities less restructuring and non-recurring items +/- gross capital expenditure.Adjusted operating cash flow is defined as EBITDA adjusted for non-cash benefits and expenses  financial cash out and tax payments.Asset disposals and other cash items includes cash inflows from asset sales as well as other investing and financing cash flows.Change in working capital refers to the change in the operating working capital requirement.Data at constant exchange rates: The data presented “at constant exchange rates” is calculated by eliminating the translation effect into euros for the revenue of the Group’s entities whose functional currency is not the euro. The translation effect is eliminated by applying Year N-1 exchange rates to Year N revenue of the contemplated entities.EBITDA: Earnings Before Interest  Taxes  Depreciation and Amortization is calculated by taking operating income (loss) before depreciation and amortization  and excluding certain operating revenues and expenses that are unusual in nature or occur rarely  such as:impairment of goodwill and non-current assets as determined within the scope of impairment tests carried out in accordance with IAS 36;significant restructuring expenses  particularly resulting from headcount reorganization measures  in respect of major events or decisions;capital gains or losses on disposals;income and expenses resulting from major litigation  significant roll-outs or capital transactions (e.g.  costs of integrating a new activity).Financial cash out includes interest payments on financial and lease debt  interest income and other financial costs.Free cash flow  as previously defined  may continue to be derived as follows: total cash generation - asset disposals & other cash items. This is also defined as EBITDA adjusted for changes in provisions  less interest and tax payments  changes in working capital  less gross capital expenditures  and less restructuring/other cash outflows.Gross capital expenditure: gross capital expenditure is defined as the sum of cash outflows for acquisitions of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets and cash outflows for acquisitions of biological assets.(Increase) decrease in net debt (alternatively  “change in net debt”) is defined as total cash generation +/- non-cash adjustments to net debt.Industrial margin: The industrial margin is defined as the difference between revenue and cost of sales (i.e. after allocation of industrial variable costs and industrial fixed costs)  before depreciation.Lease debt is defined as the present value of unavoidable future lease payments.Net debt: Consolidated net debt (or “net financial debt”) is defined as bank loans and other borrowings plus overdrafts and other short-term borrowings minus cash and cash equivalents. Net debt excludes lease debt.Net working capital requirement is defined as working capital requirement net of provisions for inventories and trade receivables; net working capital requirement days are computed on an annualized quarterly sales basis.Non-cash adjustments to net debt includes non-cash foreign exchange impacts on debt balances  IFRS-defined fair value adjustments on debt balances  and other non-cash items.Non-cash items in EBITDA includes provisions and other non-cash items in EBITDA.Operating working capital requirement includes working capital requirement as well as other receivables and payables.Restructuring charges and non-recurring items consists primarily of the cash costs of executing the New Vallourec plan  including severance costs and other facility closure costs.Total cash generation is defined as adjusted free cash flow +/- restructuring charges and non-recurring items and asset disposals & other cash items. It corresponds to net cash used in operating activities +/- gross capital expenditure and asset disposals & other cash items.Working capital requirement is defined as trade receivables plus inventories minus trade payables (excluding provisions).a In all cases  total cash generation and net debt guidance excludes the potential positive impact of asset sales.b Vallourec’s dividend policy would in any event be conditional upon the Board’s decision taking into account Vallourec’s results  its financial position including the deleveraging target and the potential restrictions applicable to the payment of dividends. Dividends and share repurchases would also be subject to shareholders’ approvalc As of December 31  2023  the borrowing base for this facility was approximately $205 million  and $9 million in letters of credit and other commitments were issuedd Free cash flow aligned with prior definition.

It’s a picture that is echoed across several ...,"By most measures  2023 was a difficult year for the stock exchange at Euronext Dublin with several high-profile departures - chiefly building materials company CRH and betting company Flutter - along with a distinct lack of initial public offering (IPO) activity.It’s a picture that is echoed across several exchanges worldwide with the London and exchanges within the Euronext Group seeing a slump in IPO activity in 2023 compared to previous years. The London Stock Exchange saw a drop of 49% last year with just 23 new issuers.The Euronext Group - which encompasses exchanges in Amsterdam  Brussels  Lisbon  Milan  Oslo  Paris as well as Dublin - saw 64 new IPOs which is down from 83 in 2022 and 212 in 2021 which was considered a bumper year.Of these 64 IPOs last year  Milan alone accounted for 38 new listings  while Paris had 15 and Oslo had seven. Dublin  along with Amsterdam  Brussels  and Lisbon  had one each.Irish construction giant CRH moved its listing to the New York Stock Exchange in September. Picture: Allie Joseph - NYSEThe one new listing in Dublin last year was a company called Aquila which invests in renewable energy infrastructure.In an interview with the Irish Examiner  Daryl Byrne  chief executive of Euronext Dublin  said Ireland “isn’t alone” as other exchanges saw “muted” IPO activity during 2023 as well but they are being proactive in engaging with companies to put a potential IPO on their radar.The core focus for Euronext Dublin going forward is to connect with Irish companies at a much earlier stage. ""Showing them all of the benefits that a listing and Euronext can deliver for them because it is a European listing ” Mr Byrne said.“We're absolutely confident that the offering we have will deliver everything that a company needs.” He said there hasn’t been the flow of new companies coming to market than there used to be which isn’t just a problem for Euronext  it's a problem for the entire ecosystem.Daryl Byrne  CEO  Euronext Dublin: Stamp duty “creates an unlevel playing field”. Picture: Moya Nolan""The crux of the issue is we haven't seen that flow of companies coming through. We're in a fortunate position being part of the Euronext group because Euronext is the number one exchange in Europe for listings  so a listing on Euronext Dublin isn't just a local listing  it's actually a European listing which gives access to a broad base of European investors ” Mr Byrne said.During 2023  Euronext Dublin saw delistings from CRH and Paddy Power owner Flutter - both of which are seeking further growth in the US. These two were among the highest-traded stocks on the Euronext Dublin platform.CRH is looking to take advantage of growing infrastructure spending by the Biden administration while Flutter is looking to take advantage of moves by States to legalise sports betting. Flutter operates betting platform FanDuel across 21 States in the US.In addition to these companies  Guinness-maker Diageo was also delisted from the Dublin exchange along with packaging giant Smurfit-Kappa.In September  the chief executive of Ryanair Michael O’Leary said the company was considering moving its listings from the Euronext Dublin exchange to Brussels citing the high level of stamp duty on trades in Ireland.Mr Byrne said for the companies that have left  Euronext delivered for them for years and this can be done for other companies.""We need to create the next wave of CRHs and Flutters ” Mr Byrne said.To try and address this the lack of companies coming to market Dublin exchange migrated trading of Irish stocks onto the Euronext Pan-European trading platform.""That resulted in a significant uplift in terms of the proportion of trading taking place on Euronext Dublin compared to the London Stock Exchange because most of our stocks are dual-listed ” Mr Byrne said.""We've made revisions to our growth market rules to really try and streamline that make our growth markets more attractive for smaller companies.” Mr Byrne said that they have their IPO Ready Programme as well and 2023 saw the largest-ever cohort of companies taking part in that.He said in Ireland there isn’t the same culture of getting to an IPO as it is in other countries such as the US. He said it is often a later ambition for some companies.In order to address some of the issues within the market  Mr Byne said they’ve commissioned Grant Thornton to do an analysis of the market and look at where things aren’t working and what can be done to enhance the effectiveness and the accessibility of the market.It has established the Irish Equity Market which is looking to take each of the recommendations from Grant Thornton and develop proposals that can be presented to the Government.“I think all of the right things are being done. Ultimately  we need to get to a point where we have four to five IPOs coming through each year ” Mr Byrne said.One of the main issues that Euronext Dublin has been raising with the Government over the last number of years is in relation to stamp duty on stock trades. As it stands  trading Irish shares carry a 1% stamp duty which Mr Byrne said is much higher than other comparable exchanges.According to the Department of Finance  in 2022 stamp duty on stocks and shares generated nearly €500m for the Exchequer. The amounts raised during 2023 were not yet available.“In the UK  it's 0.5% and then when we look across the other markets  some don't even have the equivalent which is a financial transaction tax. If they do  it could be 0.1% or 0.3%. So we're completely out there by ourselves in terms of the rate of stamp duty ” he said.Euronext Dublin has made a number of submissions to the Government calling for an abolition of this duty saying it “creates an unlevel playing field”.It's not the silver bullet that's going to solve all of the issues in the market but it is an important factor for new companies joining but also for existing listed companies as well ” he said.Mr Byrne said that the stamp duty has led to a “bizarre” situation with its Atlantic Securities Market (ASM). The ASM was set up 10 years ago to facilitate companies looking to dual-list in the US and complies with all regulations under the Securities and Exchange Commission.However  under the current stamp duty rules  an Irish company listing in the US will get an exemption from stamp duty but if that company is trading on the ASM  the stamp duty will apply.While the stock exchange part of Euronext Dublin’s business - and the high-profile departures from it - gets the most attention  it only makes up a smaller portion of its overall business. The exchange’s bonds and debt listings is the larger portion of the business and is thriving.Mr Byrne said the equity market only accounts for approximately 30% of its business while the remaining 70% is its bonds and debt listing market where it is considered a world leader.While the stock exchange side of Euronext Dublin gets most of the spotlight  Mr Byrne said that bonds  debts  and funds listings are a “crucially important” part of the business.""We're the number one exchange globally for listing bonds and listing investment funds.
