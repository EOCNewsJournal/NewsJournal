Some assets  like cryptocurrencies  require a collective belief in those benefits. Others  like wine  will undeniably provide future pleasure  such as the ability to savour a 1974 Château Margaux. Still others  like American Treasuries  represent a claim on the government of the strongest economy in the world  backed by a formidable legal system.To derive such benefits  however  an owner must be able to access their assets. And that is where the Central Bank of Russia struggles. Much like every other central bank  the CBR stores reserve assets abroad. After Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022  the G 7 froze these assets and prohibited financial firms from moving them. Of the $282bn of Russian assets immobilised in Japan and the West  some $207bn (€191bn) are held at Euroclear  a clearing-house in Belgium. When coupon payments on Russia’s assets come due or bonds are redeemed  Euroclear puts the cash into a bank account. This account is now home to roughly €132bn. Last year it earned a return of €4.4bn  which conveniently belongs to Euroclear  as per the clearing-house’s terms and conditions.Western policymakers are now considering whether these assets can be used to help Ukraine. Russia might one day have to compensate the country for war damages  which the World Bank already puts at more than $480bn. Ukraine needs more money and weapons to push back Russian advances  as well as to maintain its state and economy. At the same time  Western governments are increasingly struggling to find room in their budgets to support the war effort  and to get approval from legislatures for such spending. On February 26th Dmytro Kuleba  Ukraine’s foreign minister  once again argued that Russia’s assets should be confiscated. A day later Janet Yellen  America’s treasury secretary  called on her colleagues “to unlock the value” of those funds. Ursula von der Leyen  president of the European Commission  wants to use Euroclear’s windfall to buy military equipment for Ukraine.How exactly could this be done? Taking assets from someone usually requires a court order  but in international law things are a little more complicated. The International Court of Justice would only be able to rule on the matter should Ukraine and Russia agree to let it decide upon reparations  which is unlikely at present. The UN Security Council has the ability to pass binding resolutions  over which Russia unfortunately holds a veto.Some  including Lawrence Summers  a former American treasury secretary  want to make use of states’ right to take so-called countermeasures. These are otherwise unlawful actions that are sometimes allowed in response to unlawful acts. That Ukraine is entitled to deploy countermeasures is undisputed. How broadly the same rules apply to those acting in support of Ukraine is more controversial. Sanctions and asset freezes fall under the category  and have been widely used against Russia. Asset confiscations do not  at least in most interpretations of international law. That is because they are irreversible and would seek to punish Russia  rather than to induce a change in its behaviour.As Lee Buchheit  a veteran of international law  notes  the problem reflects a geographical mismatch. Ukraine has strong claims on Russia  but no frozen Russian assets it could use to settle them. The West has no claims but plenty of assets. Thus the challenge is to find a way to match these assets and claims.In a recent paper  Mr Buchheit and co-authors suggest just such a way. They argue that the West could provide a loan to Ukraine  in return for which Ukraine could offer its claims on Russia as collateral. The West would agree to use only this collateral for redemption of the loan. When Russia inevitably refuses to pay up  the West would then be able to foreclose on the collateral.Would this work? One difficulty is that an international body would still have to determine precisely how much Ukraine is owed. Perhaps the UN General Assembly could enlist the World Bank to crunch the numbers. But this would require careful diplomacy on behalf of the West  as well as the support of France and Germany  which have so far been unimpressed by suggestions involving creative interpretations of international law. Mr Buchheit argues the shift in approach is not quite as big as it might appear at first. The West has already gone quite far by freezing assets and making clear that it will not give them back unless reparations are paid. As he notes: “Russia won’t pay reparations. War reparations are paid by the vanquished to the victor  and this situation does not end with the Ukrainian flag flying over the Kremlin.” In effect  he argues  the West has already taken the assets.A second difficulty is posed by Belgium  which has access to most frozen Russian assets and would therefore need to receive most of the claims against Russia from Ukraine. It might be reluctant to play such a pivotal role  given the potential for retribution. It would also be unfair to expect a country of its size to be the main provider of the initial loan to Ukraine. In order to overcome this difficulty  Mr Buchheit suggests that the initial loan to Ukraine is set up in a syndicated manner with a sharing clause  which would enable lending countries to group together both when providing the money and receiving collateral. Such an approach was adopted to fund emerging-market governments in the 1970 and 1980s before bond-financing markets took over. Just as is the case now  a mechanism was needed to share risk and access to collateral.Gold rushBut perhaps there is no need to seize Russian assets after all. Indeed  the EU is already planning to implement a windfall tax on any profits they accrue. If returns continue to be siphoned off indefinitely  the difference between confiscating the asset and confiscating the income becomes smaller and smaller. In economic terms  the West is already the owner of Russia’s assets. All that is left now is to fund Ukraine’s fight. ■Read more from Free exchange  our column on economics:Trump wants to whack Chinese firms. How badly could he hurt them?

The results were initially presented at the ESMO Conference in October 2023The publication outlines the full trial results  including observations on UV1’s positive impact on objective response rate  overall survival  and additional data on increased efficacy in defined histological subtypesOslo  March 2  2024: Ultimovacs ASA (“Ultimovacs”) (OSE ULTI)  a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing immunotherapeutic cancer vaccines  today announced that the results from the randomized controlled Phase II clinical trial  NIPU  are published in the European Journal of Cancer . The trial investigates the effect of adding Ultimovacs’ cancer vaccine UV1 to second-line treatment with ipilimumab and nivolumab for patients with pleural mesothelioma (NCT04300244).NIPU is an investigator-initiated  open-label  multi-center Phase II trial sponsored by Oslo University Hospital with support from Bristol-Myers Squibb and Ultimovacs. Six university hospitals in Australia  Denmark  Norway  Spain  and Sweden participated in the trial. 118 patients were randomized between June 2020 and January 2023.The study did not meet its primary endpoint of improved progression-free survival (PFS) based on blinded independent central review (BICR). Analyses on the secondary endpoints  objective response rate (ORR) by BICR and overall survival (OS)  showed a significant benefit of adding the UV1 vaccine to ipilimumab and nivolumab. Local assessment demonstrated an improved PFS among patients in the vaccine arm for all histological subtypes combined  and new subgroup analysis demonstrates further improvement for the epithelioid subtype. The epithelioid subtype represents approximately 70% of all patients with mesothelioma.The safety profile of the combination of UV1 plus ipilimumab and nivolumab observed in the trial was consistent with that of ipilimumab and nivolumab alone  confirming the good safety profile for the UV1 vaccine.==ENDS==About UltimovacsUltimovacs is a clinical-stage biotechnology leader in novel immunotherapeutic cancer vaccines with broad applicability. Ultimovacs’ lead cancer vaccine candidate UV1 is directed against human telomerase (hTERT)  an antigen present in 85-90% of cancers in all stages of tumor growth. A broad clinical program  with Phase II trials in five cancer indications enrolling more than 670 patients  aims to demonstrate UV1’s impact in combination with other immunotherapies in multiple cancer types expressing telomerase and where patients have unmet medical needs. UV1 is universal  off-the-shelf  and easy to use. UV1 is a patented technology owned by Ultimovacs.In addition  Ultimovacs holds all rights to the proprietary TET technology platform for any possible future formulations for the treatment of solid tumor indications. The Company is listed on the Euronext Oslo Stock Exchange (OSE: ULTI).About NIPUNIPU ( N ivolumab and I pilimumab P lus/minus U V1 vaccination) is a randomized  multi-center phase II trial in which Ultimovacs’ universal cancer vaccine  UV1  is evaluated in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb’s checkpoint inhibitors  nivolumab and ipilimumab  as second-line treatment of malignant pleural mesothelioma. The trial sponsor is Oslo University Hospital  supported in the preparation and execution of the trial by Ultimovacs and Bristol Myers Squibb. The 118 patients are randomized 1:1 into two treatment arms. All participants receive treatment with nivolumab (240 mg every 2 weeks) and ipilimumab (1 mg/kg every 6 weeks) until disease progression  unacceptable toxicity or for a maximum of 2 years. Patients randomized to the experimental arm received 8 intradermal injections of UV1 vaccine during the first three months of treatment. The objective of the study is to achieve a clinically meaningful progression-free survival (PFS) benefit in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) after progression on first-line standard platinum doublet chemotherapy. Subsequent events emerging in patients in both arms of the NIPU study will continue to be monitored beyond the read-out of the primary endpoint. The ipilimumab and nivolumab combination has recently been approved as first-line treatment for patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma in Europe and the U.S.About MesotheliomaMalignant pleural mesothelioma is a rare and aggressive type of cancer that occurs in the thin layer of tissue that surrounds the lungs and inside of the chest. Mesothelioma accounted for 30 870 new cancer cases and 26 278 cancer deaths worldwide in 2020  according to International Agency for Research on Cancer (Globocan 2020). Pleural mesothelioma is a disease with a high unmet medical need  especially in industrialized countries. The median overall survival is approximately 1 year. Occupational asbestos exposure is the No. 1 cause of the disease  and several occupations like firefighters  military veterans  construction  and industry workers  are at risk. This cancer usually takes several decades to develop after a person’s first exposure to asbestos. Most patients are diagnosed after age 70 because of the long latency period. Even though the use of asbestos to a large extent is banned in many countries today  new incidences of mesothelioma will continue to be a medical and public health challenge because of the long latency period typical of the illness. For patients with inoperable disease  few treatment options are available after first-line chemotherapy. The combination of ipilimumab and nivolumab has recently shown increased survival compared to standard chemotherapy  but most patients do not respond  and improvements are called for. Telomerase is expressed in mesothelioma cells and is therefore a relevant target for therapeutic vaccination.About UV1UV1 is a universal cancer vaccine designed to induce a specific T-cell response against telomerase. UV1 consists of long  synthetic peptides representing a sequence in the reverse transcriptase subunit of telomerase (hTERT)  shown to induce CD4+ T-cells. These CD4+ T-cells have the potential to provide inflammatory signals  and T-cell support is believed to be critical for triggering a strong anti-tumor immune response. Following intradermal injection  antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in the skin are exposed to the vaccine peptides. These APCs will process the peptides and present vaccine epitopes on Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) molecules to naïve T-cells in the lymph nodes. Activated vaccine-specific T-cells will then enter the circulation and search for cells displaying their cognate antigen in the context of HLA molecules.The UV1 peptides contain several epitopes  shown to be non-restrictive in terms of (HLA) alleles for presentation. It is  therefore  not required to perform HLA pre-screening of patients  which potentially enables broad population utilization of the vaccine. UV1 is administered over three months with eight intradermal injections and the immune-modulator GM-CSF.For further information  please see www.ultimovacs.com or contact:Carlos de Sousa  CEOEmail: carlos.desousa@ultimovacs.comPhone: +47 908 92507Anne Worsøe  Head of Investor RelationsEmail: anne.worsoe@ultimovacs.comPhone: +47 90686815This stock exchange announcement was published by Anne Worsøe  Head at Investor Relations at Ultimovacs ASA  on March 2  2024 at 18:40 CET.,neutral,0.01,0.97,0.02,mixed,0.31,0.29,0.39,True,English,"['NIPU Phase II trial', 'UV1 vaccination', 'European Journal', 'Ultimovacs', 'publication', 'results', 'mesothelioma', 'Cancer', 'I pilimumab P lus/minus U V1 vaccination', 'investigator-initiated, open-label, multi-center Phase II trial', 'randomized controlled Phase II clinical trial', 'randomized, multi-center phase II trial', 'lead cancer vaccine candidate UV1', 'blinded independent central review', 'proprietary TET technology platform', 'first-line standard platinum doublet', 'high unmet medical need', 'Euronext Oslo Stock Exchange', 'novel immunotherapeutic cancer vaccines', 'Phase II trials', 'Ultimovacs’ universal cancer vaccine', 'broad clinical program', 'unmet medical needs', 'Ultimovacs’ cancer vaccine UV1', 'NON-REGULATORY PRESS RELEASE', 'Six university hospitals', 'new subgroup analysis', 'clinical-stage biotechnology leader', 'possible future formulations', 'first three months', 'Occupational asbestos exposure', 'five cancer indications', 'multiple cancer types', '30 870 new cancer cases', 'Oslo University Hospital', 'solid tumor indications', 'objective response rate', 'Bristol Myers Squibb', 'clinical-stage biotechnology company', 'good safety profile', 'meaningful progression-free survival', 'median overall survival', 'malignant pleural mesothelioma', 'full trial results', 'two treatment arms', 'U.S.', 'patented technology', 'UV1 vaccine', 'vaccine arm', '26 278 cancer deaths', 'trial sponsor', 'first-line treatment', 'broad applicability', 'tumor growth', 'Bristol-Myers Squibb', 'NIPU trial', 'ESMO Conference', 'additional data', 'histological subtypes', 'European Journal', 'primary endpoint', 'secondary endpoints', 'significant benefit', 'Local assessment', 'epithelioid subtype', 'other immunotherapies', 'N ivolumab', 'checkpoint inhibitors', 'unacceptable toxicity', 'experimental arm', '8 intradermal injections', 'Subsequent events', 'aggressive type', 'thin layer', 'International Agency', 'industrialized countries', 'No. 1 cause', 'several occupations', 'military veterans', 'industry workers', 'second-line treatment', 'Ultimovacs ASA', 'positive impact', 'human telomerase', 'PFS) benefit', 'OSE ULTI', 'disease progression', 'NIPU study', 'nivolumab combination', 'effect', 'immunotherapy', 'October', 'publication', 'observations', 'efficacy', 'ipilimumab', 'patients', 'NCT0430024', 'support', 'Australia', 'Denmark', 'Norway', 'Spain', 'Sweden', 'June', 'January', 'BICR', 'Analyses', 'ORR', 'improvement', 'ENDS', 'hTERT', 'antigen', 'cancers', 'stages', 'shelf', 'rights', 'preparation', 'execution', 'participants', '240 mg', '2 weeks', '6 weeks', 'maximum', '2 years', 'MPM', 'chemotherapy', 'rare', 'tissue', 'lungs', 'chest', 'Research', 'Globocan', '1 year', 'firefighters', 'construction']",2024-03-02,2024-03-03,globenewswire.com

Let me start with today's agenda and what we will cover in this presentation. After my introduction on the key highlights of 2023  I will come back specifically on the business and operational decisions we took during H2 in close coordination with our Board of Directors to address as fast and as efficiently as possible the short-term challenges faced by Worldline. In particular  I will give you an update on the launch of Power24  our cost-reduction and transformation ambition. Marc-Henri Desportes  our Deputy CEO  will then give you an update on our business and commercial dynamics through the last year. While Gregory Lambertie  our Group CFO  will come back on our financial results. In my conclusion  I will share our guidance for 2024  a year of transition and accelerated transformation towards a business and financial profile structurally improved at Worldline as early as '25. Let's have a look now at a few highlights of the full year '23. Definitely  2023 is a tale of 2 stories for Worldline with a very dynamic first half of the year  very much in line with our '22 performance  while we faced clearly unexpected challenges developing along the second semester. Overall  in '23  we have delivered results in line with the revised guidance issued in October '23 despite further macro deterioration during the fourth quarter. Looking at our top line  we have delivered in '23 an organic growth of 6% with much softer growth during H2. Our Merchant Services activities  in particular  still delivered 8.9% organic growth on a full year basis  but the second semester has been materially impacted by the macro and consumption evolutions and the merchant termination process in fast execution. Our adjusted EBITDA in '23  which is the exact same aggregate than our former OMDA reached €1.11 billion  stable versus '22. Finally  we generated a free cash flow of €355 million over the year  corresponding to an adjusted EBITDA conversion of 32%. But despite the headwinds we faced in H2  the group could nonetheless make decisive progresses on a number of strategic and development initiatives  which will reinforce our growth foundation for the years to come. I would like to start by the joint venture we are setting up with Credit Agricole  which is truly a strategic initiative for both our groups. We intend to create together a new major player in the merchant services and acquiring business in the French payment market leveraging the highly global technological performance and innovation capabilities of Worldline  combined with the commercial strength and exceptional knowledge of the French market of Credit Agricole and its powerful distribution network. Since the announcement in April '23  we have reached important milestones and are fully on track to close this partnership in the coming weeks and to have a full go-live of the joint venture early '25 as  expected. Our commercial push on merchants has also led to successes and additional circa 55 000 merchants onboarded last year in line with our multiyear ambition. We have also executed a number of large strategic partnerships  such as the one announced with Google recently  and pursued a solid dynamic in large merchant wins that Marc-Henri will detail later on. I'm also pleased to report that we have obtained 2 new payment licenses from local prominent regulators in the U.K. and in Singapore  enhancing our offering for both local and international merchants operating through these countries. Finally  as mentioned earlier  we've been moving fast on Power24  our transformation ambition  and I will come back to it in a minute. Now let's turn to the next page to take a closer look at the second half of '23 and all the actions engaged together with the Board and the management team. In brief   we need to adapt fast to this new environment that we faced in the second year and we decided to act decisively. First  we decided to accelerate our transformation with the implementation of Power24 in addition to key structural initiatives that were already in motion. Number two  we will  of course  continue to sharpen our risk management framework. We are in full execution mode and on track with regards to the announced merchant termination and corresponding impacts. In parallel  we reinforced our teams  our tools and processes to ensure long-term alignment with these enhanced regulatory requirements and our own risk policy. Finally  in this uncertain macro context  we will particularly focus in 2024 our management action on what we can best control  our costs  to structurally improve operating leverage and the cash flow conversion levels. Accordingly  we have adopted management incentive schemes with free cash flow objective as one of our top metrics. Now let me come back in details on Power24. After our strong focus on transformational M&A over the last decade to reach the targeted strategic scale  the group is now fully focused on extracting the full benefits of its enlarged scale. In this context  Worldline announced Power24 in October '23  enabling the acceleration of its existing post-integration transformation ambition built upon both ongoing and new initiatives. The overarching goal is not only to bring short-term cost benefits  but in parallel  to structurally increase the group's operational efficiency and reinforce its long-term competitiveness  making it faster  more automated  leaner while streamlining our global sourcing. For your information  more than 500 managers have been involved during H2 in the very detailed design of the plan. And as we start '24  the social processes are already initiated in all group entities and the granular implementation plan is already in action. Beyond having been elaborated at a fairly granular level  Power24 is also a fast and very secured transformation program. It leverages indeed both well-established and new group initiatives that we will bring to a higher scale quickly in '24. You will find on this slide some concrete illustrations of some of these productivity levels. For example  on the product and technology side  we have built a scalable platform that we will continue to leverage through further rationalization  improvement and extended functionalities such as the continuous migration of our accepted transaction into the cloud now reaching circa 40% while benefiting of the power of our new technology partnership with Google. The increase in our product convergence road map based on our target applicative landscape through the full decommissioning of the remaining legacy modules. Lastly  we will accelerate the development of our proprietary GenAI tool to improve  for example  merchants onboarding performance and assisted KYC or to increase the quality of the user experience or international efficiency. Be aware that more than 1 000 of our developers generate already more than 10% productivity gains as we speak based on GenAI deployment. Regarding global sourcing  which is another example. Let's focus on India. We have been successfully ramping up our global competency center in 2023 with head count multiplied by 2 over the last year  reaching now 1 300 people in our Indian global competency center and with the target to have a tech team over there of more than 3 000 people by the end of 2025 with a vast array of competencies such as program managers  architects or developers  of course. We are now in full execution and our social processes for Power24 has been initiated  as I said  in all the relevant group countries as the program will translate into circa 8% European onshore workforce reduction  in particular. We fully confirm our objective to deliver circa €200 million of run rate cash cost savings in '25. And thanks to a strong focus already during H2 on cash cost control and attrition management  we have already secured circa €80 million run rate impact for '24 as we start this year. To reach the targeted €200 million run rate cash cost savings  the remaining savings will be primarily delivered in H2 '24  thanks to the executive rollout that will take place post the social negotiation that will occur during H1 '24. And as a reminder  we also confirm today the circa €250 million cash cost implementation with the vast majority occurring in '24 and the smaller part in '25. Finally  in order to secure the execution of our transformation priorities  we have taken some important management decisions. To better reinforce operational performance and business control in Merchant Services as well as the fast implementation of all the Power24 initiative in this major division. Marc-Henri Desportes  Deputy CEO  takes the direct steer of the Merchant Services business unit. To ensure we properly reinforce our risk management framework in line with best-in-class standards  the group risk function will from now on directly reporting to me. To ensure the proper rollout and central steer of Power24  Lisa Coleman  our Group Head of Operational Performance  takes the full leadership of Power24 implementation and execution across the entire group. And last  to rejuvenate the commercial dynamics of the Financial Services business unit  Pascal Mauze  former Head of Group Sales Excellence  has taken the responsibility of the Financial Services sales team. Now  it's my pleasure to give the floor to Marc-Henri to dig into the business and commercial dynamics.Marc-Henri Desportes: Thank you  Gilles  and good morning to all. I would like to start today with an update on the decision that we had announced to the market in Q3 regarding our merchant termination process following a German regulatory audit and the implementation of a reinforced risk control framework for the entire online portfolio. After evaluating at that time a maximum risk of €130 million run rate revenues  we would like to update you on the processes and figures. First  our final assessment of €130 million is fully confirmed as a maximum. Second  the termination of the German portion representing €40 million run rate revenues has been completed entirely in 2023. Third  the termination process regarding the merchants outside of Germany is fully on track with more than half already executed  and we will confirm objective to end the remaining part by the end of H1 this year. We continue to raise the bar and to sharpen our risk management framework  ensuring perfect alignment with enhanced regulatory requirements and our own risk policies. Now regarding our MSV indicator  we observed that it was overall up circa 7% in 2023 versus 2022  reaching €480 billion. The 3 most important points to flag here are the following: first  after a solid start of 2023 benefiting from some catch-ups in specific verticals such as travel  we have seen a normalization in MSV growth in Q2 and Q3 as then said. Second  when we published our third quarter at the end of October  we reduced our full year expectations given the volume slowdown leading to a revised Q4 forecast. You can see the narrowing of the curve gap between 2022 and 2023 materializing in November and even more end of December and it's reflected in our Q4 performance. Third  for the beginning of 2024  here we can see that the trend observed end of 2023 continues with MSV growth more on the low single-digit side. This pattern is fully factored in our guidance that Gilles will later detail in this presentation. Beyond macroeconomic context  Worldline continues to be very dynamic in its commercial activity with several wins  both on SMB and large merchants  both in store and online that I will dig in  in the next 2 slides. Now deep diving on MS Dynamics  we've mentioned KPIs. In 2023  we have increased our merchant -- our base of merchants with a net additional 55 000 new merchants  pushing our merchant base at the end of 2023 at 1.4 million merchants. Since 2021  we have grown our merchant base by 135 000 merchants on a net monthly average growth of 6 000 merchants. Given the context  we are satisfied by this growth versus 2022 because  first  it is in line with our trajectory ambition and also because it shows that we continue to develop actively our franchise in our core markets  and in particular  in new markets such as Italy and Greece. During 2023  we continued to win new customers  a lot of big names  as you can see on this slide  and we continue to extend the use of our solutions to existing customers to offer new products and to conclude key partnerships. I will start with the omnichannel. In this domain  the rollout of our a la carte offerings since several quarters continued to be a strong differentiator  allowing us recently to extend our business with Vertbaudet  a renowned French clothes brand for kids. With them  we have developed a local and global payment gateway with multiple acquiring solutions improving massively their conversion rates. On the hospitality vertical  our omnichannel experience has been key for Boscolo using Worldline payment services from prebooking to check-out on the lever -- one of the levers for this win is related to the partnerships we have with Sabre (NASDAQ: ) and Oracle (NYSE: )  both being fully connected to our solutions. On the online cross-border  our global expansion approach to offer direct access to local payment means for domestic corridors continue to be a key growth accelerator for our clients. And on that specific offering  we signed recently Opn  particularly for the access to the Thai customer  Thailand  and obviously  Google  but I will come back on it later. Last  on the travel and airline vertical being already strong in the paying solutions  we continued to enrich our value proposition adding a significant payout layer with the signing of a new virtual card deal with Visa (NYSE: ) in B2B for online travel agencies. It will support them to pay their suppliers through easier integration  more standard and with faster funding. With all these examples  you can see our commercial dynamic is strongly driven by our product portfolio with dedicated verticalization approach. It remains a key success and differentiating factor that we will develop further through continuous investment in innovation and R&D. Now in addition to new customer logos  I want to deep dive on the partnership side  which are a key pillar for future growth. On this subject  I'd like to come back on the strategic agreement that we signed with Google in collaboration with Google Cloud  Worldline's offering in a new era of fintech excellence. Worldline selects Google Cloud technology to boost its digital transformation while streamlining its operation. As part of the expanded partnership  Worldline will also serve as one of Google's key payment providers in Europe and across multiple geographies for Google's own B2C solutions. We will provide to Google customers more advanced payment options  support for more payment networks  improved cross-border conversion  et cetera. We will also collaborate together to develop new innovative solution in digital payments and customer experience improvements. Regarding the other partnerships. On the distribution side  I can mention Datalogic  a global technology partner -- leader in automatic data capture and industrial automation solutions. The new generation of mobile computers will enable payments with Worldline SoftPos. Through the partnership  Worldline solution will be promoted to the Datalogic ISV and distribution network  allowing us to open a new distribution channel in the larger tech ecosystem. And on the solutions side  the innovative partnership with SV365 and Sodexo (EPA: ) aims to create an exceptional lining experience  revolutionizing the concept of self-service kiosks. The technological highlights include Android terminals accepting all payments with corresponding apps and services. These partnerships are some proof points of Worldline capabilities in terms of breakthrough innovation to be embedded in partner's ecosystem and enlarging our reach. Our innovation is at the top of Worldline priorities  and 2023 has been a year of investment and new product launch. On the in-store space  we successfully rolled out our Tap to Pay product  leveraging our software solution with now more than 150 partners connected. On the innovation acceptance  we have developed a suite of products enriching user experience such as the universal QR code automatically displayed on the POS screen without requiring any merchant handling and managing automatically the payment process. And on the account to account -- all the account-to-account pay button with more than 3 000 connection to banks. Regarding the mobility and travel market  we have developed our open payment solution with Tap 2 Use allowing travelers to pay with their Apple (NASDAQ: ) Pay wallet without need to use their Face or Touch ID. Our payment orchestration growth channels continued to develop significantly with 355 partners connection available and offering an agnostic payment management software. Last  on the domestic corridors  we have pursued our expansion with the development of 4 geographies with local acquired partnerships  enabling our local payment means to large e-com merchants while increasing their conversion rates. We will pursue our investment efforts in product enrichments going forward as it remains a strong growth enabler for us bringing value to our merchants. To end this presentation  I will comment on the Financial Services and MeTS commercial dynamics. During the fourth quarter  on the commercial front  Financial Services signed an agreement with Volksbank for the emission of payment cards in Italy  underlying the strength of Worldline solution for the issuing value chain. Within the issuing business  numerous contract extensions were also signed  notably in Belgium with BNP Paribas (OTC: ) Fortis (NYSE: ) Bank and KBC Banks. Business was also strong in Asia Pacific  a key region in Worldline development with the extension of 5-year contracts with EastWest Bank and Baiduri Bank. Regarding Mobility & e-Transactional Services  commercial activity has been solid  notably public expanding business with ASP and the renewal of ANCV in the domain of holiday vouchers  supporting the dematerialization of vouchers used by millions of French people. Now  let me hand over to Gregory who will walk you through more detailed financial results.Gregory Lambertie: Thank you  Marc-Henri  and good morning  everyone. Before I dive into detailed '23 numbers  let me share with you an overview of finance actions in the last few months  both in terms of financial policy and regarding the metrics we will share with you going forward. On the debt and liquidity management first  we sought to secure ample liquidity for Worldline through active debt management while taking advantage of the inverted yield curve throughout '23 to lengthen our average maturities and to meaningfully increase our interest income. As a result  our financial policy and liquidity remained strong. In parallel  we've designed a detailed reporting framework ensuring a tight financial control to support the execution and tracking of Power24 and secure our trajectory of operating leverage improvement while reinforcing our focus on free cash flow delivery. On the reporting front  let me also present a couple of new metrics reflecting feedback from our shareholders  investors analysts over the last quarter and introduced to ensure more clarity and comparability with peers. First  we'll now disclose net-net revenue information  excluding schemes and partners fees  therefore  showing growth in margin levels on an NNR basis as is customary in our sector. Second  we're introducing EBITDA  which is equal to the former OMDA minus the integration and rationalization costs. This is a new metric  and more importantly  it is the metric upon which 500 top managers will be incentivized reflecting our enhanced focus on free cash flow generation. We'll  of course  continue to provide adjusted EBITDA  i.e.  EBITDA before those integration costs  which is strictly equal to our former OMDA to ensure continuity of performance tracking for our investors and analysts. Reconciliation tables are available in the appendix as well as in the press release. Now looking back on 2023. We reached our revised guidance on all 3 counts with revenues of €4.6 billion  representing growth of 6% or 3.9% on a net-net revenue basis. On profitability  adjusted EBITDA reached €1.1 billion or 24.1% of revenues  meaning 29.4% on an NNR basis. Free cash flow stood at €355 million  reflecting a conversion ratio close to 32%. Normalized net income group share reached €521 million  while reported net income group share was minus €817 million  reflecting a noncash impairment of €1.1 billion related to the decrease in the carrying value of the MS business line. Normalized diluted EPS stands at €1.85 per share versus €1.88 in 2022. Moving on  revenue performance by business line. Our fourth quarter came in at €1.2 billion  i.e.  organic growth of 1.3% versus 4.8% in Q3. This slowdown was anticipated to some extent in October '23 and factored in the revised guidance. Looking at it by business line  organic growth in Q4 was impacted by a number of headwinds. Merchant Services grew 3.1% organically or 2.7% on an NNR basis reflecting  first  a slowdown of digital consumption growth across our core geographies as well as the impact of merchant terminations impacting our performance by around 2%. Financial Services was down 4.4%  mostly impacted by slow commercial dynamics versus a very strong Q4 '22  where we signed a landmark contract with ING. Last  MeTS came in flat during the quarter. For the full year  organic growth is at 6% or 3.9% on an NNR basis. MS is up 8.9% or 6.7% on an NNR basis. FS was down 1.3% and MeTS was up 0.1%. Let me quickly walk you through the H1-H2 dynamics for '23. And it's clear on the Slide  '23 saw a very contrasted performance between the first and the second half  a 6% full year organic growth is made of 9.3% growth in H1 at group level with MS growing at 13%. While in H2  group growth slowed to 3% and 5.3% for MS on the back of the changes I just outlined in the previous slide  mainly impacting the fourth quarter. Now moving on to the next slide regarding adjusted EBITDA performance. During 2023  Worldline's adjusted EBITDA reached €1.1 billion  representing a 24.1% margin  140 basis points out from '22 in line with our revised guidance. On an NNR basis  adjusted EBITDA margin was down 110 basis points at 29.4%. By business lines  the main highlights are as follows. On MS  adjusted EBITDA reached €847 million or 25.5% margin or 33.8% on an NNR basis  down 200 basis points versus 2022  both in net and net-net revenue terms. Financial Services adjusted EBITDA came in at €275 million or 29.1%  a drop of 50 basis points. MeTS profitability is up 70 basis points to 14.1%  benefiting from cost control measures put in place early '23. Finally  corporate costs were under control at €59 million  slightly down versus '22 in absolute terms. Now let's look at H1 versus H2. The bridge shows well how trading conditions impacted MS margins. I'll be brief regarding FS and MeTS since margin development has been broadly similar from one semester to another reflecting  for FS  the impact of slower top line developments; and for MeTS  the effect of cost mitigations already mentioned. So focusing on MS. As a reminder  in H1 MS margin increased 100 basis points supported by a 13.1% revenue growth coupled with a good operating leverage above 35%. Turning to H2  the contraction in profitability was mainly driven by 4 factors that accelerated in Q4. Number one  slower payment volume growth from 10% in H1 to 6% in H2 driven by lower consumer spending. Number two  mix effect  a direct impact on the contribution margin. Number three  the impact of merchant terminations for €30 million. And four  the accumulated impact of inflation  in particular  wage increases from '22 and '23 that we were not able to fully compensate by repricing actions and cost-saving plans. We expect operating leverage to rebound above 40% in 2024 driven by progressive growth reacceleration throughout the year and progressive Power24 ramp-up. Now moving from adjusted EBITDA to other elements of the income statement. The largest impact in the P&L is clearly the €1.1 billion goodwill impairment  which impacts our reported numbers. As a result  we report an operating loss of €817 million. Regarding the impairment test  a detailed slide is in the appendix. And the main points to bear in mind are  on the business plan front  we took into account a conservative view versus the ambition we have for Worldline in the medium term. And in terms of technical factors underpinning the IFRS valuation exercise  we also applied some extra buffers versus the intrinsic parameters calculated by external valuers. This is  of course  a noncash effect that reflects the accounting adjustment of the fair value of the assets in our book as of December '23. Now more in operations and the P&L. First  integration and rationalization costs. We discussed it with a number of you  and clearly  we're committed to meaningful reduction. Excluding strategic projects accelerated in Q4  those costs are already down 8% to €176 million. Our EBITDA  therefore  reached €905 million. As mentioned earlier  this new metric will be a key driver of management incentive for around 500 managers in the group. Excluding Power24  integration and rationalization costs were reduced by 30% in '24 with the view to continue to reduce them drastically in the coming years. Our net finance costs are broadly stable at €48 million. The tax charge was €40 million with a normalized effective rate of 18% in '23 versus 23.5% in '22. Going forward  we expect an effective tax rate between 23% and 24%. Last  on noncontrolling interests  the positive €141 million contribution is impacted by the goodwill impairment allocation to the different MS entities that are not fully owned. Excluding this effect  the amount of noncontrolling interest impact is equivalent to 2022. Now on the cash flow statement. We generated €355 million of free cash flow in '23 or 32% of our adjusted EBITDA. The main parameters of our free cash flows are: in terms of capital intensity  we started to decrease CapEx as a percentage of revenue  down from 7.4% in 2022 to 7.2% this year for total CapEx of €333 million. In terms of capitalized production  we spent 4% of revenue  stable versus '22. Working capital was a slight negative at minus €18 million  and for 2024  we expect a slight negative contribution with working cap becoming cash neutral in the medium term. Mirroring the P&L trend and excluding Power24  our integration and rationalization cash costs are down 14% to €166 million and will continue to go down going forward. Overall  the full year free cash flow before strategic investments stood at €384 million or close to 35% cash conversion. After strategic investments  reported free cash flow came in at €355 million or a 32% cash conversion. Going forward  we're committed to materially increase free cash flow conversion by reducing the capital intensity of the model meaning CapEx should broadly remain constant in absolute value. We also intend to reduce integration and rationalization costs well below 1%. Working capital should become neutral. And all this will be leading to north of 50% free cash flow conversion in the medium term. Finally  during the year  we delevered by €391 million  mainly driven by the €355 million free cash flow we just mentioned. Our net debt  therefore  stands at €1.8 billion  which equates to 1.6x adjusted EBITDA. Important elements to mention on the debt and liquidity side for '23 are we've increased our average debt maturity through short-term bond buyback and active management of mid-term maturities. On top  we've already secured the remaining part of our September '24 maturity through a bond issue in September '23 at attractive costs. And last  we kept a strong liquidity profile  qualified as exceptional by S&P  with €1.9 billion in gross cash at the end of 2023. This active management is a strong support to our investment-grade rating we're committed to. Now let me hand over to Gilles to conclude.Gilles Grapinet: Many thanks  Gregory. And indeed  to conclude this presentation  let me reemphasize how we are  Board and management  actively executing since the third quarter all the necessary transformation actions to strengthen Worldline's business and financial perspective during this year '24. It will be indeed a year of transformation and transition with a heavy focus of myself and my team on stringent execution  and in particular  with a reinforced central steer on all our core immediate priorities. First  Power24 execution is in full motion it will deeply adapt our operating model to the fast-changing environment  but more importantly  it will also structurally improve with very quick benefits our operating leverage for the midterm. Secondly  we are ramping up future growth engine initiatives. I mentioned the Credit Agricole joint venture addressing the French acquiring market with a go-live confirmed early '25 as well as the continuous enrichment of Worldline value proposition through new products and partnership launch. Third  our efforts and priorities are definitely focused on improving our free cash flow generation supported notably by the fast plan reduction of integration costs and as well evolution. Regarding the governance  the Board will continue to adapt it as committed. After the sudden passing of our Chairman  Mr. Bernard Bourigeaud  in December '23  the Board has immediately initiated the search for a new Chairman in early January. The process driven by the Nomination and Governance Committee on behalf of the Board is progressing actively and the new Chairman should be selected before the end of March '24. Regarding the evolution of the Board composition itself  the Board of Directors is working on a partial renewal of its composition to bring it down to a maximum of 13 members  excluding the 2 employee directors  while new profiles could join the board. As already mentioned  this year will be a transition year for our group with a strong focus on the execution of the transformation plan in a macro environment we expect to remain challenging in our main markets in Europe. Consequently  we expect to deliver in '24 a top line organic growth of at least 3%. This guidance assumes an unchanged macro environment along the year in our core geographies with softer growth in H1 in the low single-digit area mainly due to the merchant termination impact and the progressive growth reacceleration in H2 towards a more normative comparison basis. On the adjusted EBITDA level  we expect to achieve at least €1.17 billion of adjusted EBITDA with a modest improvement in adjusted EBITDA in H1 while H2 will benefit from Merchant Services growth reacceleration and from Power24 ramp-up. Finally  we expect a free cash flow of at least €230 million mainly impacted this year by the Power24 one-off implementation costs. And to conclude  let's take a quick step back. Over the last 10 years  we have built a true payment leader at scale. After its necessary transition in '24  we will definitely enter a new strategic phase  rebalanced towards extracting the full benefit of our remarkable combination of scale and advanced technology in European payments and beyond. Looking at growth and growth potential. The combination of our leading positions in Europe still benefiting from natural payment market tailwinds  coupled with our powerful distribution network  will be a key success factor in the rollout of our existing innovative products as well as the launch of new growth engine. It will be also supported by the scalability of our transformed platform accelerating our go-to-market while reducing the marginal cost of our solutions. On the operating leverage side  as soon as '25  we will have the full benefit of the Power24 transformation plan increasing Worldline operational efficiency  agility and reinforcing our competitiveness by a more agile and leaner organization. Both growth and operating leverage will translate into a free cash flow generation coming back to a more normative level in the midterm  benefiting as well from the fast reduction  as Greg said  of our integration and transformation costs because the vast majority of Power24 cash-out and past M&A integration efforts will be largely behind us. Lastly  always to reinforce our value proposition  we will  of course  pursue some M&A but much more focused on bolt-on acquisitions  including products and technologies  while still keeping a low leverage and solid balance sheet. All in all  with all our assets and current cost of actions  we will deliver in the midterm a top line organic growth in the mid- to high single digit  a continuous operating leverage and adjusted EBITDA improvement from 2024 onwards and a free cash flow conversion in fast progression towards circa 50% or above. We will  of course  provide further details during the Capital Market Day  which we intend to hold in the second half of 2024. I thank you very much for your attention so far. And I am now ready with Marc-Henri and Gregory to take your questions.Operator: [Operator Instructions] First question is from the line Frederic Boulan from Bank of America.Frederic Boulan: Firstly  if we -- just a question on the commercial dynamics in the business. So in H2  we saw 15 000 wins in  in-store merchants  the online base was stable. So it's a pretty sharp deceleration. This is what we saw before. So when we look at the volume  can you explain a little bit what's going on there in terms of commercial traction? Are you seeing more competition in some of the segments? So that would be first point. And then secondly  when we look at the operating leverage  so can you come back a little bit on what happened in the second half? We had in the MS segment 5% revenue growth  but about €50 million EBITDA decline. So when we look at '24  you're guiding for  at the group level  50 to 100 bps margin expansion if I look at your minimum EBITDA commitment. So can you explain a little bit what do you think will change and give you that confidence in guiding considering the pretty big compression we saw in the business in 2023?Gilles Grapinet: I'll give maybe the floor for Marc-Henri to the first question and for Greg to the second one.Marc-Henri Desportes: Frederic  regarding the commercial dynamics  this profile of merchant wins that are stronger in H1 than in H2 is something we observed on the previous years. If you may remember  it was already the case in 2022. So this year  it's not very different in terms of overall profile. As I said  the momentum remains good. The macroeconomic context is somehow deteriorated. But I can't tell that we have a significant impact on merchant disruptions from that point of view. So overall  in terms of profile we observed in 2022 and we are observing again in 2023  so no significant change there.Gregory Lambertie: And on your second question  2023 has been impacted mainly in H2 '23 in MS by 3 points. First  the decision to terminate merchants  which clearly impacted the margin. Second  the overall macro softness across all geographies as well as some mix effect  which we alluded to in Q3. And slightly less repricing actions in Q4 versus initial expectations due to the economic environment at the end of '23 and lower volumes. Those 3 elements are the main drivers of the margin rate decrease in H2 '23. In '24  while we're keeping a cautious stance on macro and where termination impacts will impact H1  we should continue to see an improvement in EBITDA margin recovering throughout H2 benefiting from less merchant termination effect and a more favorable comparison basis as well as operating leverage benefit. All in all  we expect 40% operating leverage in 2024  thanks to those 2 effects and of merchant termination Power24 ramp-up.Operator: We will now take the next question from the line of Mohammed Moawalla from Goldman Sachs.Mohammed Moawalla: Two for me. Obviously  2024 is going to be a year of internal focus as you sort of flagged on the call and in the release. I just want to kind of better understand that from a commercial standpoint  what are you doing to kind of safeguard against any sort of impact on the external side  whether it's both handling a more challenged macro but potentially risk of kind of market share losses as the organization is much more kind of inward focused around kind of driving the earnings quality  executing on the transformation program? And then  secondly  we hear a lot more around platforms from a lot of the kind of next-gen players and increasing traction there. You obviously got a sizable exposure to SMBs in Europe. I'm just curious to better understand your strategy around platforms. And is there a risk that as you're a bit more internally focused that you all sort of fall behind? I know it's interesting to hear your comments  Gilles  that M&A -- tuck-in M&A going forward is going to be more technology focused  so curious to get a better understanding around your strategy on platforms and how you kind of take advantage of that or protect against future kind of competitive threats there?Gilles Grapinet: Maybe I will start  and of course  Marc-Henri can elaborate them. What I mentioned during the call was precisely to strike the right balance between this internal focus that is necessary to adapt to the current situation and the headwinds we face  notably to make sure that we do the proper fixed cost extraction at the requested speed  and at the same time  to maintain our very permanent and long-term established focus on growth and development. So from that standpoint  I flagged during the call that we've been elaborating the Power24 initiative mobilizing circa 500 top managers of the group in all service lines. It was precisely to make sure that we were adequately targeting all the necessary action on all fronts to make sure we can extract the relevant productivity gains  implement fast certain existing actions. And from that standpoint  I want to really clearly state here that  as I said  it's much more than the cost-reduction program only. It is an actual improvement of the company. It will allow us to accelerate many technology initiatives to reinforce our technology capabilities  as we flagged  for example  in our global competency center in India that will give us meaningful additional means to pursue developing features  technology progress on our platform and support to our customers  too  for their own needs and features. So it is exactly the point where we have been looking at very carefully is to make it a transformation program  bringing simultaneously benefit to our internal efficiency  but also to our customers through more efficiency  agility and also brain power to pursue developing and enriching the platforms. It's why I've been a bit long presenting all the levers that are standing behind Power24. The easy way would have been to say we just cut across about 6% of the staff. It's not the way we think. We care for the long-term growth development and the quality of the technology of this firm. It's why Power24 has been such a granular effort in terms of design and now is moving to implementation. With that framework  I give the floor to Marc-Henri to elaborate a bit more on the technology side.Marc-Henri Desportes: No  Mohammed  I think you have a very right question  it's core on this market to have the right platform and the right connections  which is something in which we invested a lot. We have  as we said  our target platform is live. We are extending its connections with all the markets. The domestic corridor I'm referring to is indeed enabling more markets  more access to remote geography. We optimize authorization rates  and better authorization rate than the competition. And the connection to new distribution models to be outwards-focused  new distribution partnerships is a clear focus of the team  both in '23  even more so in '24 and that leverages a lot of technology. I mentioned SoftPos and the 150 partners we signed in 1 year on the technology that allows to take payment on any Android device and now as well on Apple device. I think it's a very good example of how we were able to onboard an element  a piece of technology  connected to our core platform and make it scalable in signing and onboarding new partners. And this logic  this strategic momentum we have to boost this partnership is really the key of the story -- on the core platform. The joint venture with Credit Agricole is another -- a typical example  it's structured and based on our target platforms. It's leveraging their distribution partnerships  it's encompassing the full technology stack. So there is clearly no deviation from that. You could see we have a very clear discipline and dynamic on the investment front for the years to come  but it is not a disruption bringing the investment level extremely low versus what we are doing. We are not giving up on the platform investment. We are not giving up on the technology. And we are certainly not giving us on the commercial front. Like Gilles said  Power24 is there to optimize cost  primarily for automation but also where we can get this benefit. Clearly  we bring it  but we don't touch the sales front. We don't touch what is at the core for growth because we know we have to bring this dynamic back versus what we experienced at the end of this year.Operator: We will now take the next question  which is from the line of Josh Levin from Autonomous Research.Josh Levin: Two questions for me. Gilles  you made a brief comment about M&A and I wanted to ask for some clarification. The Worldline story for many years was about consolidating the fragmented European payments landscape. To what extent is still -- is that still the Worldline story? Do you still intend to try to consolidate Europe? And then the second question is about the impairment charge in Merchant Services. The press release says the impairment was based on conservative assumptions reflecting the change in the valuation paradigm in the payments industry. Does that mean the impairment was driven by lower peer group valuation multiples or because you're forecasting lower cash flows in Merchant Services than you were previously?Gilles Grapinet: So clearly  we believe that this mandate that we were given at the IPO and supported by the shareholders' community to consolidate Europe has been largely executed. We came to a strategic scale that is -- that we believe is largely in line to anchor this leadership position in Europe and from now on also to develop beyond Europe. We said M&A will still happen in Europe. We believe it will be less transformative than in the past because obviously there are much less target available outside just to set revenues  and of course  because we see now new types of M&A-related opportunities where we believe also the balance sheet can be less decisive than it was in the past years. If you look at the Credit Agricole joint venture  it is a perfect example of still a very meaningful combination of strength between ourselves and the French -- and in this case  a French leading bank  but which is basically not set up strictly speaking as an acquisition  but much more as a combination in kind that will generate a fantastic benefit for the group in the medium term. This type of discussion with banks we have further ongoing in Europe as we speak. Some may imply some balance sheet-related cash out. Some may be set up much more like a partnership. So it's why definitely this is a pivotal moment. We believe that there will still be some consolidation  but it will be of a different nature than the fast scale game that has been happening over the last years  clearly. So it's why also we are so comfortable thinking that it is also a right moment for us to harvest all the benefit of this scale. Our scale  notably the quality of our technology at scale  is one of the key factors that is attracting to us some leading banks. They don't choose us because of the check we put on the table  they choose us for the quality of our products and technology. I can tell you it has been duly assessed over the recent transaction we announced by our banking partners. And so it's why we believe we will pursue expanding our partnership and distribution network. But at the same time  it will still allow us to have much less effort to do in terms of heavy integration  heavy lifting as we had to do over the past years while also we foresee very steady acceleration of the free cash flow generation in the coming years because M&A will help us on the product and technology side or distribution side but also improving Worldline. But at the same time  it will be from the core platform we have been building that will just get more scale and [indiscernible] thanks to this extended distribution. I hope I am giving you where we see the market going and where we want to drive growth.Gregory Lambertie: And regarding the -- regarding the impairment charge  Josh. I mean looking at the 2023 accounts  we felt this was the right time to be conservative  of course. First  multiples have been divided by 2 to 3 [indiscernible]. And those sector valuation levels are also reflected in the parameters we took into account to articulate our valuation. And second  this was also your question  in terms of business plan assumptions. As I mentioned earlier  we also took a conservative view by taking a business plan that is below the one we have in mind for our ambition for the medium term in Worldline. That we'll share in detail at the Capital Markets Day.Operator: We will now take the next question from the line of Alexandre Faure from BNP Paribas.Alexandre Faure: Just a couple of things from me  if I may. Firstly  a clarification on the 2024 free cash flow guide. Could you please remind us what's included in the guide when it comes to the setting up of the Credit Agricole joint venture and perhaps the first CapEx efforts relating to that JV? And second question is following up on previous questions on the M&A strategy. I think  Gilles  thanks for highlighting the nature of those partnerships you could strike with banks in the future being a bit less capital intensive. I think you also talked about using M&A to improve product and distribution. So where do you see gaps at the moment in Worldline's portfolio or go-to-market?Gregory Lambertie: So on your first question  Alex  on the 2024 free cash flow. For the Credit Agricole joint venture  we're talking about -- around about €20 million. As I mentioned  we're pretty comfortable in improving the free cash flow going forward. First of all  because we intend to increase EBITDA  reduce the integration and rationalization costs  make sure that capital intensity is lower with constant CapEx going forward  working cap flat. Therefore  we expect to reach a midterm ambition of above 50% after more than 40% in 2025.Gilles Grapinet: Thank you  Greg. Alex  thanks for your question. And of course  I don't want here to be ahead of ourselves by entering too much into the details we intend to share with you guys and the community at our Capital Market Day  where we give -- of course  where we will give much more detail about where we want to drive the business  the offerings  the product range of Worldline. But let me flag here that if I look at today's tech stack of Worldline  both in terms of quality of features and fit-to-market value proposition  we don't miss things in the current situation. We -- one of the reasons to do the transaction  you remember  with Ingenico was precisely to increase our online capability portfolio. Here we are. We've been recently making specific targeted acquisition in particular niches of the market. You remember that we made an investment on the marketplace payment features with OPP online payment platform. We are extremely satisfied with the way we work with this entity  which is leveraging the market reach of Worldline with a very specific value proposition for marketplaces  which are actually booming  as you know. So this was a typical example of a product and technology that we wanted to acquire to have this capacity to leverage it. And Marc-Henri was very clear about the SoftPos evolution that is allowing to engage into more of micro merchant segment  on one hand  but also to provide some large retailers relatively light touch payment acceptance capabilities in store. Now expanding a bit beyond that  we today have what we need  no doubt. What we want to pursue doing is to see where we could bring Worldline in terms of value chain positioning. Here  M&A may help to help us to add to our existing market positioning the possibility to expand within the payment value chain  either vertically or horizontally. As you know  the boundaries in the world of payment acquiring and acceptance are not engraved in the model. We have 1.4 million merchant base. What else can we sell or upsell to a merchant base of that side? It is a strategic topic for us  and we have many initiatives ongoing. We have pilots. We test things with partners. It may go into the direction of more integrated software. It may go into added functionalities for payout for merchants  not only doing the paying  for example  or moving into card issuing type of activities. I don't want to elaborate too long here  but just for you to know  guys  we are constantly looking also beyond our geographic reach into the depth of the offerings of Worldline. It is there that M&A can help to accelerate and to expand leveraging the franchise  the merchant connections  the bank connections and our partner reach also.Gregory Lambertie: Just to give you a bit of color in terms of numbers. For 2024  when we're looking at our partners' growth  what we're looking at is growth that is in the north of 20%. So this is a channel that is exciting and that is a good ROI.Gilles Grapinet: So of course  much more on that topic  Alex  and many thanks for your question  at the Capital Market Day.Operator: We will now take the next question from the line of Hannes Leitner from Jefferies.Hannes Leitner: We have a couple of questions. The first one is around -- is to Marc-Henri  you're replacing Niklaus Santschi. Could you maybe comment around his departure and then also how you want to split your responsibility? And is this leading the Merchant Services just a temporary solution until you find a new head? And then the second one is on the Power24. You have updated on -- in a press statement that it's around 8% of head count. Maybe you can talk about the split between the different segments and geographies and then what is the expected head count by end of this year? You talked about offshoring  so is there actually the net amount of head count to be increased?Gilles Grapinet: Maybe I will start here because  of course  as you rightly pinpointed  it is one of our important management decision we announced today. I wanted Marc-Henri to take the direct steer of the most important division of the group because we want tighter execution of our current group strategic priorities  clearly to reinforce the performance delivery  to strengthen the business and risk control implementation  and more importantly or as importantly  to ensure a full and swift Power24 implementation into the largest division of the group. And of course  this is also taking the lessons from the past months and particularly what we've been experiencing in the MS division over the past months after the Q3  clearly. And then  of course  we will reorganize ourselves. I take over the risk myself also that was reporting so far to Marc-Henri to letting also some more bandwidth to MS  and we will do some other adjustments in our ways of working.Marc-Henri Desportes: Yes. And maybe just to come back on the split of my time. You know that we have also upgraded recently the management of the 2 of our business lines with Caroline Jéséquel in MeTS and Alessandro Baroni in FS. I think they have reorganized their team  put in place everything that was needed defined by Power24 plan. So I think it's -- we need much less of my bandwidth. MS was already under my management's responsibility  and I will focus much more time with these teams that I already know well. And I think we have all the assets and the quality of people now to ramp up in terms of gains of performance of Power24 execution  and of course  in terms of growth. Coming back to also your point in terms of Power24 split  it's clearly well balanced between all the key European geographies where we have significant workforce being France  Germany  Belgium  Switzerland  Sweden. So all these countries are involved. And in terms of overall head count  you should see a decline. The decrease in onshore will be more than the increase in offshore.Gilles Grapinet: Thank you  Hannes. Look forward to interacting with you guys. We are already largely above the hour  conscious that this is busy time also for you and for us all. So really  I would like to thank you for being with us this morning. Looking forward further interaction in the coming road shows. My message here is that we are  with the Board  fully focused on executing our current short-term and medium-term priorities and I really look forward to further interaction  and of course  look forward at the Capital Market Day to give you a full refresh on Worldline after these fantastic 10 years to build this company and how we are going to pursue developing the franchise in the coming years into this new environment that we are going in terms of challenges  clearly  to overcome quickly  thanks to our initiatives. But more importantly  I want to flag that the fundamentals of this sector  the fundamental of Worldline are certainly as strong as they have been in the past years and they will be even better after the accelerated transformation of Power24. Thank you  and look forward to interacting with you.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.
