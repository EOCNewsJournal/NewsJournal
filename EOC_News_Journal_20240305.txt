36927,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/03/04/russia-ukraine-war-funding-central-bank-assets/,Europe Edges Closer to ‘Plan B’ for Using Frozen Russian Money,Leery of seizing all of Russia’s state assets  Europe may opt for a next-best approach that could still provide Ukraine billions of euros a year.,The United States is still pushing to seize outright all the frozen Russian Central Bank assets it can to help fund Ukraine  even as broader Ukraine funding remains blocked by Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives. But it is becoming clearer that in Europe  the only politically realistic approach to using Russian money to fund Ukraine is by tapping a much smaller windfall that amounts to about 1 percent of Moscow’s frozen funds.The United States is still pushing to seize outright all the frozen Russian Central Bank assets it can to help fund Ukraine  even as broader Ukraine funding remains blocked by Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives. But it is becoming clearer that in Europe  the only politically realistic approach to using Russian money to fund Ukraine is by tapping a much smaller windfall that amounts to about 1 percent of Moscow’s frozen funds.The big question is whether that relatively small amount can be squeezed even harder to provide a more substantial and ongoing funding stream for Ukraine  which is now worried less about postwar reconstruction than the grim situation of its ammo-starved army on the battlefield.“There is a massive financing crisis. Europe and the West are not really addressing it ” said Timothy Ash  a sovereign strategist at RBC Bluebay Asset Management and a fellow at Chatham House  a U.K. think tank. He figures Ukraine needs about 100 billion euros a year to fight off the Russian invasion  and another 50 billion euros a year for reconstruction.On paper  a big chunk of that money is theoretically available. There don’t appear to be any insurmountable legal obstacles to seizing the entirety of the roughly $300 billion in frozen Russian Central Bank assets held by Europe  the United States  and a handful of other countries since Russia’s full-scale invasion of its neighbor two years ago. What’s lacking is political will. Legislation to authorize such a seizure has yet to pass the full U.S. Congress (though a version may get wrapped into the latest congressional effort to fund Ukraine)  and Europe  fearing Russian retaliation  has balked at that more aggressive step.What is gaining momentum in Brussels  however  is a less controversial option that would take the approximately $3 billion a year that accrues from frozen Russian assets and use that money for Ukraine. It’s a fraction of the more ambitious proposals  and faces many of the same legal questions  but seems to have more political backing from key countries such as Belgium (custodian of the lion’s share of frozen Russian assets).Last month  the European Union formally ordered the accumulating profits from Russian assets to be hived off and kept separate from the underlying balance  with a view to supporting Ukraine at a later date. Last week  European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen went further  arguing that the windfall proceeds could be used not just to pay for Ukraine’s eventual reconstruction but also for its present-day arms requirements. On Monday  Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said Belgium is ready to allocate some of the proceeds (held largely in Belgium’s Euroclear financial clearinghouse) to fund Ukraine’s defense needs.“All the signals suggest the Europeans are prepared to make use of the Euroclear windfall ” said Brad Setser  an expert on capital flows and sovereign debt at the Council on Foreign Relations. “The only questions are how assets outside Euroclear are handled  and whether they are willing to get creative to maximize the income stream.”Setser  like many other economists  advocates a more aggressive approach to managing the captive Russian Central Bank assets—the 3 billion euros or so a year that accrue currently are a floor  not a ceiling  he said.“The 3 billion [euros] is the lowest possible number that you can imagine. It should be much bigger ” said Setser  who is also a former U.S. Treasury official. Given that the frozen Russian assets are likely to remain that way for some time  he argued for a more proactive approach—for instance  by investing the proceeds that are piling up in Europe in higher-yielding U.S. dollar deposits or in even higher-yielding sovereign debt from different countries.It’s a view that is gaining adherents among finance professionals  who make both an economic and a moral case for a more aggressive use of Russian assets. Ash suggested investing those Russian proceeds in emerging market bonds that could fetch returns of up to 10 percent a year; another  more audacious idea is to use the money to purchase Ukrainian government bonds directly  thus using Russia’s frozen treasure to underwrite Ukraine’s survival. Still other suggestions include using the trickle of annual proceeds to service debt on future joint EU bond issues that could be used to finance Ukraine in one big lump sum.For Ash  finding a way to make better use of the frozen Russian funds is a political imperative; European taxpayers have so far supported Ukraine to the tune of tens of billions of euros  while Russians have not  partly out of lingering concerns about violating the sanctity of the Russian state’s alleged property rights.“Our taxpayer dollars are subordinate to the Russian taxpayers ” he said. “We are willing to pick up the check for Russia’s aggression  but not prepared to charge Russia for it?”Since momentum began building last year for the seizure of Russia’s frozen assets  the situation has changed in two related ways.First  as von der Leyen made clear last week  those funds aren’t just thought of as a down payment on Ukraine’s estimated $400 billion to $500 billion reconstruction tab. The lack of artillery shells  advanced jets  and long-range fire handicapped Ukraine’s long-planned offensive last year and enabled Russian forces to shrug off staggering losses and regain the battlefield initiative earlier this year.“It seems a little early to be talking about full reconstruction ” Setser said. “Ukraine’s in a fight for survival.” He said that one advantage highlighted by von der Leyen’s proposal would be to provide a recurring  predictable stream of funding for Ukrainian armaments purchases  which could help kick-start so far laggard European production of much-needed munitions.“What I think is clever about von der Leyen’s proposal is that  if you take my view and invest it in 10-year securities  this is actually a stable future income stream for Ukraine and Ukrainian weapons purchases ” he said. “So you could use it to buy arms this year  and next year  and thereby incentivize increased [arms] production.”More broadly  Europe’s (and the United States’) struggle to outsource the fight in Ukraine at relatively small levels of expenditure means that  if Russia prevails over Ukraine  other European countries would feel threatened—with a much bigger bill to pay in the future than a few score billion euros of Russia’s money today. European countries have increased their defense spending to record levels but are still largely short of the informal threshold of 2 percent of GDP required of NATO members. If Ukraine loses  Ash suggested  Europe would have to ramp up to closer to 3 percent on defense spending—about 400 billion euros a year  every year.“Is Ukraine’s security a national security priority? I would say absolutely it is. Then how are we going to fund it?” Ash asked. “In the end  you do whatever you have to do to do that  and the only credible source of funding for Ukraine is from Russian assets.”,neutral,0.04,0.93,0.03,negative,0.04,0.29,0.67,True,English,"['Frozen Russian Money', 'Plan B', 'Europe', 'European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen', 'future joint EU bond issues', 'Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal', 'former U.S. Treasury official', 'higher-yielding U.S. dollar deposits', 'captive Russian Central Bank assets', 'RBC Bluebay Asset Management', 'U.K. think tank', 'full U.S. Congress', 'one big lump sum', 'U.S. House', 'Ukrainian government bonds', 'massive financing crisis', 'insurmountable legal obstacles', 'latest congressional effort', 'present-day arms requirements', 'lowest possible number', 'emerging market bonds', 'ongoing funding stream', 'frozen Russian assets', 'many other economists', 'higher-yielding sovereign debt', 'The United States', 'same legal questions', 'Euroclear financial clearinghouse', 'broader Ukraine funding', 'European Union', 'European taxpayers', 'Russian invasion', 'Russian retaliation', 'big question', 'Chatham House', 'big chunk', 'frozen treasure', 'income stream', 'sovereign strategist', 'other countries', 'Russian proceeds', 'other suggestions', 'Russian money', 'Russian funds', 'realistic approach', 'smaller windfall', 'small amount', 'grim situation', 'full-scale invasion', 'political will', 'aggressive step', 'controversial option', 'ambitious proposals', 'political backing', 'key countries', 'accumulating profits', 'underlying balance', 'later date', 'defense needs', 'Euroclear windfall', 'capital flows', 'Foreign Relations', 'aggressive approach', 'proactive approach', 'different countries', 'finance professionals', 'moral case', 'audacious idea', 'political imperative', 'lingering concerns', '100 billion euros', '50 billion euros', '3 billion euros', '3 billion [euros', 'postwar reconstruction', 'eventual reconstruction', 'windfall proceeds', 'annual proceeds', 'Timothy Ash', 'Brad Setser', 'aggressive use', 'Republicans', 'Representatives', '1 percent', 'Moscow', 'substantial', 'battlefield', 'fellow', 'paper', 'entirety', 'handful', 'neighbor', 'Legislation', 'seizure', 'version', 'momentum', 'Brussels', 'less', 'fraction', 'Belgium', 'share', 'view', 'Monday', 'signals', 'Europeans', 'expert', 'Council', 'floor', 'ceiling', 'way', 'time', 'instance', 'adherents', 'economic', 'returns', '10 percent', 'survival', 'trickle', 'tune', 'tens', 'billions', 'Russians']",2024-03-04,2024-03-05,foreignpolicy.com

Provided that the AGM votes in favor of this proposal  the dividend is expected to be sent out via Euroclear on Thursday  April 18  2024.Guidelines for compensation of senior executivesThe guidelines apply to Industrivärden's CEO and other senior executives. The guidelines must be applied to compensation that is agreed  and changes that are made to previously agreed compensation  after the guidelines are adopted by the 2024 AGM. Compensation decided by the AGM is not covered by the guidelines.No substantive changes have been made to the guidelines for compensation to senior executives compared to those most recently adopted by the 2020 AGM  except under the heading Forms of compensation etc.  where a simplification has been made in the passage concerning Pension benefits by deleting the regulation of retirement age in respect of the right to receive pension benefits  and the cap on Other benefits has been increased. In addition  certain editorial changes have been made.The guidelines’ promotion of the Company’s business mission  long-term interests and sustainabilityThe company's business mission  goals and strategy are presented on Industrivärden's website www.industrivarden.net.The successful and sustainable implementation of the company's business mission  goals and strategy to safeguard the Company's long-term interests require the Company to recruit and retain qualified employees. The guidelines support this in that senior executives can be offered a market-based and competitive total compensation in relation to responsibility and authority.Forms of compensation etc.Compensation must be market-based and competitive and be related to individual performance as well as the Company's performance. Compensation may consist of the following components: fixed cash salary  short-term variable cash compensation  pension benefits and other benefits.Short-term variable cash compensation may amount to a maximum of 50 percent of fixed annual cash salary. Compensation must be linked to fulfillment of individual criteria which are determined annually and evaluated based on the executive's effort and performance. Criteria may be financial or non-financial  and consist of individually adapted quantitative or qualitative goals. Criteria must be designed so that they have a clear connection to value creation for the Company and promote the Company's business mission and a sustainable implementation of the Company's long-term interests.Fulfillment of criteria for payment of short-term variable cash compensation must be measured over a period of one year. The Compensation Committee is responsible for assessing to what extent criteria for payment of short-term variable cash compensation to the CEO have been met. The Board then determines the compensation for the CEO. The CEO is responsible for the assessment of fulfillment of the criteria for short-term variable cash compensation to other senior executives. Short-term variable cash compensation shall not be pensionable.The Board must have the opportunity  according to law or agreement  with the limitations that may follow therefrom  wholly or partially reclaim variable cash compensation paid on incorrect grounds.Pension benefits  including health insurance  must be defined contributions  unless the executive has a defined benefit pension according to mandatory collective bargaining provisions. Premiums and other costs due to defined contribution pension benefits are paid to the CEO and other senior executives in a total amount of up to 40 percent of fixed annual cash salary  depending on the senior executive's position.Other benefits may include life insurance  health insurance  car benefit and fitness benefits. Such benefits may amount to no more than ten (10) percent of fixed annual cash salary  depending on the position of the executive.In addition to the above – and independently of these guidelines – the AGM may decide on share and share price-related compensation. Since 2012  the Company has established long-term incentive programs  as resolved by the AGM. The programs are open to all employees  require employees to buy shares in the Company  and have three-year terms. Results are assessed based on performance targets that relate to the performance of Industrivärden's Class C shares. Current share incentive programs and those that have ended during the year are presented in more detail on Industrivärden's website www.industrivarden.net.In the event of the termination of employment by the Company  a notice period of no more than two (2) years is applicable. Fixed cash salary during the notice period and severance pay must not exceed a total corresponding to the fixed cash salary for two (2) years. In the event of termination by an executive  the notice period may be a maximum of six (6) months  without the right to severance pay.Furthermore  compensation related to any non-compete clause may be paid. Such compensation shall compensate for any loss of income and shall only be paid to the extent that the former employee is not entitled to severance pay. Compensation may amount to no more than 60 percent of fixed cash salary at the time of notice of termination  unless otherwise stated in mandatory collective agreement provisions  and be paid during the period for which the commitment to restrict competition applies  which may be no more than 12 months after the cessation of employment.Decision-making process to determine  review and implement the guidelinesThe Board has established a Compensation Committee. The Committee's tasks include preparing the Board's decisions on proposed guidelines for compensation to senior executives. The Board must draw up proposals for new guidelines at least every four years and submit these proposals for resolution at the AGM. Guidelines apply until new guidelines are adopted by a general meeting of shareholders. The Compensation Committee must also monitor and evaluate variable compensation programs for Company management  the application of compensation guidelines to senior executives and the Company's current compensation structures and compensation levels.When preparing the Board's proposal for compensation guidelines  pay and employment conditions for the Company's other employees are taken into account as information on employee's total compensation  compensation components  as well as increase and rate of increase of compensation over time have constituted part of the Compensation Committee's and the Board's decision-making basis when evaluating the fairness of the guidelines and the limitations that follows from these.The members of the Compensation Committee are independent of the Company and Company management. When the Board reviews and decides on compensation-related matters  the CEO or others in the Company's management are not present  insofar as they are affected by such matters.Departing from the guidelinesThe Board may decide to temporarily depart from the guidelines in whole or in part if  in an individual case  there are special reasons for this and a departure is necessary to satisfy the Company's long-term interests or to ensure the Company's financial viability. The Compensation Committee's responsibilities include preparing the Board's decisions on compensation matters  which includes decisions on deviations from the guidelines.Long-term share savings programBackgroundSince 2012 the AGMs have resolved on the implementation of long-term share saving programs for employees of the company. The terms of the share savings program (the “Program”) now proposed by the Board of Directors to the 2024 AGM corresponds to the program adopted by the 2023 AGM. Industrivärden’s long-term share savings programs that are outstanding and were completed during the year are presented in more detail in Note 8 of the Annual Report 2023.The Program entails that the employee after three years receives so-called performance shares  provided that certain conditions are fulfilled and that the employee has invested a portion of his or her base salary in Industrivärden shares and that the employee has not given  or been served  notice of termination during the Lock-in Period (as defined in item d below).The purpose of the Program is to encourage Industrivärden’s employees to increase their shareholdings and thereby further emphasize long-term shareholder value. The share savings program is deemed to increase Industrivärden’s prospects for retaining and recruiting competent employees as well as the employees’ interest and involvement in Industrivärden’s business and development. The performance conditions  which are based on the total return for Industrivärden shares during the term of the Program  are deemed to further enhance the participants’ long-term commitment and the mutual interests between Industrivärden’s shareholders and employees. The Program is intended to be annually recurring and constitute the form of long-term variable remuneration.The Board of Directors thus proposes that the 2024 AGM resolve to implement a long-term share savings program for in total no more than 20 employees of Industrivärden.The Board of Directors’ proposal for resolutionThe Board of Directors proposes that the AGM resolve to implement the Program based on the terms and conditions set out below.a. The Program is open to the CEO and a maximum of 4 other members of Industrivärden’s management (“CEO” and “Management” respectively)  to a maximum of 6 key persons employed by Industrivärden (“Key Persons”)  and to other permanent employees of Industrivärden (“Employees”)  however in total a maximum of 20 permanent employees of Industrivärden.b. Provided that the CEO  Management  Key Persons and Employees (as applicable) have made an own investment in Class C shares in Industrivärden (“Savings Shares”) during the Acquisition Period (defined in item c below)  such participant is under the terms of the Program offered the opportunity to be granted shares free of charge  from a designated third party at the end of the Lock-in Period  as follows:(i) Provided that the total return for the Industrivärden Class C shares during the Lock-in Period is equal to or exceeds 10 percent  all program participants may be granted 0.5 Class C shares in Industrivärden (“Performance Share”) per Savings Share (ii) Provided that the average annual total return for Industrivärden Class C shares during the Lock-in Period is equal to or exceeds SIXRX during the same period of time  the CEO and Management may be granted 1 additional Performance Share  Key Persons may be granted 0.5 additional Performance Share  and Employees may be granted 0.5 additional Performance Share  per Savings Share (iii) Provided that the average annual total return for Industrivärden Class C shares during the Lock-in Period exceeds SIXRX by 2 percentage points during the same period of time  the CEO and Management may be granted 1.5 additional Performance Shares and Key Persons may be granted 1 additional Performance Share per Savings Share  and(iv) Provided that the average annual total return for Industrivärden Class C shares during the Lock-in Period exceeds SIXRX by 3 percentage points during the same period of time  the CEO may be granted 1 additional Performance Share per Savings share.In total  the Program thus entails that the CEO may be granted 4 Performance Shares per Savings Share  that Management may be granted 3 Performance Shares per Savings Share  that Key Persons may be granted 2 Performance Shares per Savings Share  and that Employees may be granted 1 Performance Share per Savings Share.c. The maximum number of Savings Shares that each program participant may acquire is limited in such way that Savings Shares may be acquired for an amount corresponding to a maximum of 10 percent of the participant’s gross annual base salary for 2024. Acquisition of Savings Shares shall take place during the period from 22 July 2024 until and including 31 October 2024  however with a right for the Board of Directors to extend the period in certain circumstances (the “Acquisition Period”).d. Grants of Performance Shares are expected to take place shortly after publication of Industrivärden’s third quarter interim report for 2027. The time from the last day of the Acquisition Period to the date of publication of Industrivärden’s third quarter interim report for 2027 is defined as the “Lock-in Period”.e. In order for a program participant to be granted Performance Shares it is required that  with certain specific exemptions  the participant has not given  or been served  notice of termination of employment in Industrivärden during the Lock-in Period and that the participant  throughout the Lock-in Period  has retained the Savings Shares. Saving Shares disposed of prior to the expiration of the Lock-in Period will therefore not entitle to any grants of Performance Shares. Should a program participant retire during the Lock-in Period  the entitlement to receive allotment of Performance Shares shall be reduced in proportion to the time remaining in the Lock-in Period.f. The Program shall comprise a maximum of 50 000 Class C shares in Industrivärden. Should Savings Shares be acquired at a share price such that the total number of Performance Shares exceeds 50 000  the number of Performance Shares that may be transferred to the program participants will be proportionally reduced.g. The Board of Directors shall be authorized to establish the detailed terms and conditions for the Program.h. In the event significant changes occur in Industrivärden or the market  or in the event the costs for the Program significantly exceed the estimated costs  and this  in the opinion of the Board of Directors  results in a situation where the conditions for grants of Performance Shares under the Program become unreasonable  the Board of Directors shall be entitled to make adjustments to the Program  including  among other things  a decision to reduce the grant of Performance Shares or to not grant any Performance Shares at all.i. The number of Performance Shares shall be subject to recalculation as a result of intervening bonus issues  splits  rights issues and/or other similar company events.Drafting of the proposalThe proposal regarding the Program to the 2024 AGM has been decided on by the Board of Directors following preparation by the Compensation Committee.Hedging  etc.To hedge the financial exposure that the Program is expected to have  the Board of Directors intends to enter into a share swap agreement with a third party on behalf of Industrivärden  at market terms  whereby the third party in its own name shall be entitled to acquire and transfer Class C shares in Industrivärden to the program participants.As proposed the Program may comprise a maximum of 50 000 Class C shares in Industrivärden  representing approximately 0.01 percent of all outstanding shares in Industrivärden and approximately 0.03 percent of all outstanding Class C shares in Industrivärden.In accordance with the scope of the Program as described above  the cost upon full grant is estimated to approximately SEK 14 million  under the assumption all current employees participate in the Program and that all program participants acquire the maximum number of Savings Shares.The Program is expected to have only marginal effect on Industrivärden’s and the Industrivärden Group’s key ratios.Majority requirementsThe AGM’s resolution in accordance with the above requires a majority of more than half of the votes cast.Nominating Committee’s proposalsThe Nominating Committee has consisted of Bo Selling (L E Lundbergföretagen)  Håkan Sandberg (Jan Wallander and Tom Hedelius Foundation and others)  Jan Svedjebrant (SCA Pension Foundations and others)  Mikael Schmidt (Essity Pension Foundation and others)  and Fredrik Lundberg (Chairman of the Board of AB Industrivärden).

36929,Clearstream,NewsApi.org,https://www.thejournal.ie/lawyers-say-uk-predator-vigilante-group-bordering-entrapment-sentencing-hearing-dublin-6316856-Mar2024/,UK predator vigilante group methods 'bordering on entrapment'  lawyers say at sentencing hearing,A Dublin man is facing sentencing for sending explicit messages to someone he believed was a 14-year-old girl.,THE METHODS USED by a UK group seeking to expose “predators” online have been described as “objectionable” and “bordering on entrapment” by lawyers for a Dublin man facing sentencing for sending explicit messages to someone he believed was a 14-year-old girl.Keith Redmond (45) of Clearstream Court  McKee Avenue  Finglas pleaded guilty at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court to attempting  by electronic means  to disseminate sexually explicit material to a child between 30 August and 3 December  2022.At a previous hearing the court heard that the alarm was raised by a UK-based group called Volunteers for Predator Exposure.That group seeks out people who attempt to communicate with children by creating decoys and waiting to see if the decoy is contacted.In this case  the group created a decoy called ‘Amber’  a 14-year-old girl living in Leeds in the UK.The court heard that Redmond had put his details on a social media platform called Kick as “male  44  from Ireland” and that the decoy  ‘Amber’  had connected with him.Anne Rowland SC  defending  today told Judge Orla Crowe  during her plea in mitigation  that this case had caused her concern and should cause the court concern.She said her client had posted a profile on a widely used website  that was not dedicated to porn or underage children  without seeking to contact anyone underage and a message had come to him.She said her client had been approached by a UK-based person seeking out predators who are abusing or seeking to exploit underage girls. She said this was not the case with her client.Rowland said this case could be distinguished from others before the court as her client did not set out to look for an underage girl and there was no evidence that he did.She said the messaging was “not nice” and had sexual content but submitted he indicated to a Probation Officer that he was playing out a fantasy and there would never be a meeting.She said her client had not shown up for an arranged meeting and contact was again initiated by the decoy following two weeks of “radio silence” from her client.She said there was something very objectionable about the methods of the organisation which set out to entrap her client. She said he had nothing of this nature on his mind and was “beguiled” into it.Rowland said she had a big concern this was bordering on entrapment and the court could take that into account in sentencing.She submitted  while her client feels ashamed and remorseful  there was not a “real person” involved or being abused.She said a probation report before the court wrongly said he had initiated the contact but pointed out an assessment in the report places him at low risk of reoffending.Judge Crowe said it had not been previously asserted that this was “borderline entrapment” and she adjourned finalisation of the case until Thursday to give her time to reread the text messages.At the earlier hearing  Garda Tracey O’Reilly told Karl Moran BL  prosecuting  that within a few messages  Redmond asked ‘Amber’ what age she was and she replied that she was 14.Rowland pointed out that Redmond then replied  “OK I’m a bit too old for you ” whereupon the decoy replied  “it’s up to you ” and Redmond answered  “add me so.”The court heard that Redmond then requested that the conversation move to the private messaging service WhatsApp.AdvertisementRedmond and the decoy proceeded to text one another over the following three months in a conversation that spanned 83 typed pages  the court heard.The chat initially comprised of ordinary conversation but then became sexually explicit.Redmond sent the decoy four photographs of his penis on dates in November 2022. He also sent selfies of his face and tattoos.The court heard there was a “grooming element” in that Redmond discussed meeting ‘Amber’ for sexual activity  offered to buy her a phone and discussed running away to live together.They spoke about booking a hotel in Leeds and Redmond said he would have to act as her father and she would have to pretend to be his daughter.“Your Mum would kill me if she knew I was texting you so this is our secret ” one text read  while another told ‘Amber’ she was Redmond’s “sexy secret”.The accused said he had never done anything like this before and told ‘Amber’ she was “honest  beautiful and smart”.On one occasion  Redmond texted: “I don’t care that you’re 14  I like you lots.”The court heard that the UK-group used open source technology to locate the person making contact with their decoy and then got in touch with a similar Irish group called Child Online Protection Enforcers.Members of this group located Redmond on a laneway beside Boyle Sports on Manor Street in Dublin 7 and there were ‘angry scenes’ the court heard  before gardaí were called and Redmond asked for garda protection.Redmond gave his phone to gardaí and told them about the conversations on Kick and WhatsApp with ‘Amber’. He said they talked about “normal stuff” at first but that it turned serious and they talked about what they would do to one another.“After a while I sent a dick pic  I don’t know why I did it  but I did ” Redmond told gardaí.He has no previous convictions.Rowland  told the court that members of the UK group Predator Exposure have been tried in the UK for false imprisonment in the last year.Counsel also pointed out that Kick is a social media platform and that Redmond told gardaí he had not gone on the site with any intention of making contact with a child.The court heard of a planned meeting between Redmond and ‘Amber’ in a Leeds hotel that never happened as Redmond did not book flights.The decoy sent him several messages on the day asking if he had come and that Redmond didn’t reply until he texted “sorry” two weeks later and told ‘Amber’ that he got “cold feet”.Redmond was working as a barman and was married with one child at the time of the offence  the court heard.Counsel said Redmond’s marriage had been breaking down for several years at the time of the offence and he was very unhappy.“He embarks on this obsessive correspondence  it has all the hallmarks of a lonely person ” Rowland said.As a result of this prosecution Redmond has lost his job  left the family home and is now living with his parents in the city centre.,neutral,0.02,0.74,0.24,negative,0.02,0.28,0.7,True,English,"['UK predator vigilante group methods', 'sentencing hearing', 'entrapment', 'lawyers', 'Garda Tracey O’Reilly', 'Dublin Circuit Criminal Court', 'social media platform', 'Karl Moran BL', 'following three months', 'open source technology', 'Judge Orla Crowe', 'private messaging service', 'similar Irish group', 'Anne Rowland SC', 'decoy four photographs', 'Judge Crowe', 'Dublin man', '14-year-old girl', 'McKee Avenue', 'electronic means', 'explicit material', 'previous hearing', 'Predator Exposure', 'sexual content', 'Probation Officer', 'two weeks', 'radio silence', 'low risk', 'earlier hearing', '83 typed pages', 'grooming element', 'sexual activity', 'one text', 'one occasion', 'Boyle Sports', 'Manor Street', 'angry scenes', 'garda protection', 'normal stuff', 'underage girls', 'explicit messages', 'UK-based group', 'UK-based person', 'big concern', 'real person', 'text messages', 'THE METHODS', 'arranged meeting', 'probation report', 'sexy secret', 'Clearstream Court', 'borderline entrapment', 'ordinary conversation', 'underage children', 'UK group', 'Keith Redmond', 'court concern', 'gardaí', 'predators', 'lawyers', 'sentencing', 'someone', 'Finglas', '30 August', '3 December', 'alarm', 'people', 'decoys', 'case', 'Leeds', 'details', 'Ireland', 'Amber', 'plea', 'mitigation', 'client', 'profile', 'website', 'porn', 'others', 'evidence', 'fantasy', 'contact', 'something', 'organisation', 'nature', 'mind', 'account', 'assessment', 'reoffending', 'finalisation', 'Thursday', 'time', 'WhatsApp', 'Advertisement', 'chat', 'penis', 'dates', 'November', 'selfies', 'face', 'tattoos', 'phone', 'hotel', 'father', 'daughter', 'Mum', 'accused', 'lots', 'UK-group', 'touch', 'Members', 'laneway', 'conversations', 'Kick']",2024-03-04,2024-03-05,thejournal.ie

ISS last year added ""board-aligned"" investment voting guidelines that opposed many ESG resolutions  though the new offering may appeal to clients who want to go further against ESG.Kelly said the firm is making available the new guidelines in partnership with Bowyer Research  a fund consulting business based near Pittsburgh  for the upcoming shareholder meeting season.ISS will initially make Bowyer's research available only to public pension plans  according to firm principal Jerry Bowyer.Bowyer said he calls his approach that of an ""ESG skeptic"" and that he supports ESG resolutions less than 5% of the time  compared to about 50% for the ISS benchmark guidelines. Bowyer said he and ISS executives started speaking after he criticized ISS on social media site LinkedIn in June 2023  discussions that led to the collaboration.""This is an effort at de-politicization. This isn't an effort to get companies to be more conservative  this is an effort to get companies out of the political process "" Bowyer said.For example  Bowyer said he recommended votes against shareholder measures at Apple (NASDAQ: ) last week related to labor and pay equality issues.But Bowyer said he backed proposals from conservative groups that he said focused on company policies that created investment risks including a measure calling on Apple to review how it curates app content  citing the removal of religious material in China.That measure won support from only 2% of votes cast  a typically low level for conservative proposals. Sponsors have blamed a lack of support from proxy advisors  and a petition organized by Inspire Investing  which serves Christian investors with what it calls ""biblically responsible"" policies  called for more specialty policies from proxy advisers.Inspire portfolio manager Tim Schwarzenberger called the new ISS offering ""a big step in the right direction.""",neutral,0.03,0.95,0.02,negative,0.04,0.26,0.69,True,English,"[""ESG skeptic' clients"", 'Exclusive-Proxy adviser', 'ISS', 'offerings', 'Reuters', 'U.S. Republican politicians', 'upcoming shareholder meeting season', 'influential proxy adviser majority', 'new ""ESG skeptic"" option', 'board-aligned"" investment voting guidelines', 'firm principal Jerry Bowyer', 'voting policy choices', 'Institutional Shareholder Services', 'fund consulting business', 'public pension plans', 'many shareholder resolutions', 'Inspire portfolio manager', 'specialty voting guidelines', 'many ESG resolutions', 'social media site', 'ISS global head', 'ISS benchmark guidelines', 'new guidelines', 'shareholder measures', 'investment stewardship', 'investment risks', 'proxy advisors', 'proxy advisers', 'new offering', 'Inspire Investing', 'specialty policies', 'ESG) topics', 'Maryland-based firm', 'Ross Kerber', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'corporate elections', 'longstanding mission', 'wide array', 'strong reception', 'seven types', 'climate-focused groups', 'religious funds', 'political process', 'equality issues', 'conservative groups', 'company policies', 'app content', 'religious material', 'low level', 'Tim Schwarzenberger', 'big step', 'right direction', 'Watchlist DB1Gn', 'Lorraine Kelly', 'conservative proposals', 'Christian investors', 'Bowyer Research', 'ISS executives', 'Reuters', 'AAPL', 'ETR', 'shareholders', 'statement', 'criticism', 'governance', 'clients', 'partnership', 'Pittsburgh', 'approach', 'time', 'LinkedIn', 'June', 'discussions', 'collaboration', 'effort', 'politicization', 'companies', 'example', 'votes', 'Apple', 'NASDAQ', 'pay', 'removal', 'China', 'support', 'Sponsors', 'lack', 'petition', '©']",2024-03-04,2024-03-05,investing.com

Continued surge in trading volumes and signs of its equity derivatives segment picking up have driven shares of Asia's oldest stock exchange by over 400% from the same period a year ago. BSE shares  which are listed on the National Stock Exchange  closed at ₹2352.45 on Saturday. The stock hit an all-time high of ₹2 598.95 on February 5. BSE shares' 430% gains in the past year far exceeds the 35% upmove in US-based Intercontinental Exchange (ICE)  the second-best performer in the pack London Stock Exchange gained 21%  US-based CME Group rose 19%  Deutsche Boerse advanced 16.7% and Singapore Stock Exchange moved up 8.8% in this period. Shares of Australian Securities Exchange and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing declined in the last 12 months.Analysts said higher cash market volumes have boosted BSE's profitability.""The cash volumes on the BSE have increased by up to 50% a day in the past one year  which has also led to higher transaction charges "" said Deepak Jasani  head of retail research at HDFC Securities. ""The value of the transactions on BSE have also increased as the share prices have gone up.""BSE's net profit in October-December jumped 123.3% and revenue from operations rose 82.2% from last year.Jasani said the exchange's revival of its derivatives segment in the last year by launching Sensex Futures and Options has added to its growth.BSE  under the new management led by CEO Sundararaman Ramamurthy  relaunched Sensex derivatives in May last year after repeated attempts to boost the segment in recent years. So far  NSE has dominated the country's stock F&O trading business. BSE's weekly Sensex contracts attracted trading interest amid the heightened frenzy in equity derivative trading.The exchange's market share in terms of notional turnover stood at 13% and 5% in terms of premium turnover in the country's equity derivatives segment  according to Motilal Oswal Financial Services The robust initial public offering (IPO) market in the past year has also boosted the country's stock exchanges.India has emerged as the global leader in the number of IPOs in 2023  according to EY India.Brokers see domestic exchanges' prospects remaining stronger as India's weight in global equity indices rise ""There's immense scope for higher volume and participation domestically and globally through higher allocation in emerging index like MSCI in the coming 10 years compared to other international exchanges "" said Dharan Shah  founder of Tradonomy  a Mumbai-based investment research advisor.The run-up in share price has also resulted in BSE becoming the most expensively valued listed exchange in terms of price to earnings (PE) ratio. While other global stock exchanges are trading at a PE in the range of 19-27 times their CY24 earnings  BSE trades at 67 times  said Jasani.""This is because of its compact equity structure where a small growth in earnings can lead to higher EPS  which may not apply to other exchanges "" he said. ""For other exchanges  the earnings growth expected is at 5-10% whereas BSE has a growth potential of about 80% in FY25  which is the reason for the higher PE of the stock.""Analysts think there is still some more steam left in the stock price. It will be critical for the stock to cross its current high to extend upsides.""Its making a clear flag pattern and a breakout and closing above Rs2600 could lead to a further upside of 16% with a target Rs2925 - 3000 levels "" said Shah.While a drop in the trading volumes on account of the stock market trend reversal remains the key risk  analysts said its bigger rival NSE's listing could also hurt investor appetite.""We may see some setback in this buying interest once NSE may float its IPO  as BSE is enjoying a 'scarcity premium'  being the sole listed exchange "" said Jasani. ""Since the shares of NSE are not freely available in the market  people are rushing in to buy BSE shares and be a party to the gains.""",positive,0.92,0.08,0.01,negative,0.01,0.15,0.85,True,English,"['BSE stock best performer', 'global bourses', 'robust initial public offering (IPO) market', 'stock F&O trading business', 'Motilal Oswal Financial Services', 'target Rs2925 - 3000 levels', 'Mumbai-based investment research advisor', 'stock market trend reversal', 'higher cash market volumes', 'other global stock exchanges', 'ETMarkets WhatsApp channel', 'performing listed bourse', 'US-based CME Group', 'CEO Sundararaman Ramamurthy', 'global equity indices', 'compact equity structure', 'clear flag pattern', 'equity derivative trading', 'Hong Kong Exchanges', 'higher transaction charges', 'weekly Sensex contracts', 'other international exchanges', 'US-based Intercontinental Exchange', 'Bombay Stock Exchange', 'oldest stock exchange', 'National Stock Exchange', 'London Stock Exchange', 'Singapore Stock Exchange', 'Australian Securities Exchange', 'equity derivatives segment', 'past one year', 'cash volumes', 'market share', 'other exchanges', 'trading volumes', 'retail research', 'global leader', 'Sensex derivatives', 'trading interest', 'domestic exchanges', 'HDFC Securities', 'higher volume', 'higher allocation', 'higher EPS', 'past year', 'stock price', 'Sensex Futures', 'higher PE', 'last year', 'sizzling rally', 'Continued surge', 'time high', 'best performer', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'last 12 months', 'share prices', 'net profit', 'new management', 'repeated attempts', 'recent years', 'heightened frenzy', 'notional turnover', 'premium turnover', 'immense scope', 'emerging index', 'coming 10 years', 'current high', 'key risk', 'bigger rival', 'investor appetite', 'buying interest', 'scarcity premium', 'small growth', 'growth potential', 'PE) ratio', 'same period', 'Dharan Shah', 'CY24 earnings', 'EY India', 'Deepak Jasani', 'earnings growth', 'BSE shares', 'Agencies', 'world', 'signs', 'Asia', 'Saturday', 'February', '430% gains', '35% upmove', 'second', 'pack', 'Clearing', 'Analysts', 'profitability', 'head', 'value', 'transactions', 'December', 'revenue', 'operations', 'revival', 'Options', 'May', 'country', 'terms', 'number', 'IPOs', 'Brokers', 'prospects', 'weight', 'participation', 'MSCI', 'founder', 'Tradonomy', 'run-up', 'range', '19-27', '67 times', 'FY25', 'reason', 'steam', 'upsides', 'breakout', 'Rs2600', 'drop', 'account', 'listing', 'setback', 'sole', 'people', 'party']",2024-03-04,2024-03-05,economictimes.indiatimes.com

GenSight Biologics’ pipeline leverages two core technology platforms  the Mitochondrial Targeting Sequence (MTS) and optogenetics  to help preserve or restore vision in patients suffering from blinding retinal diseases. GenSight Biologics’ lead product candidate  GS010  is in Phase III trials in Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON)  a rare mitochondrial disease that leads to irreversible blindness in teens and young adults. Using its gene therapy-based approach  GenSight Biologics’ product candidates are designed to be administered in a single treatment to each eye by intravitreal injection to offer patients a sustainable functional visual recovery.About Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON)Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON) is a rare maternally inherited mitochondrial genetic disease  characterized by the degeneration of retinal ganglion cells that results in brutal and irreversible vision loss that can lead to legal blindness  and mainly affects adolescents and young adults. LHON is associated with painless  sudden loss of central vision in the 1 st eye  with the 2 nd eye sequentially impaired. It is a symmetric disease with poor functional visual recovery. 97% of subjects have bilateral involvement at less than one year of onset of vision loss  and in 25% of cases  vision loss occurs in both eyes simultaneously.About LUMEVOQ ® (GS010; lenadogene nolparvovec)LUMEVOQ ® (GS010; lenadogene nolparvovec) targets Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON) by leveraging a mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) proprietary technology platform  arising from research conducted at the Institut de la Vision in Paris  which  when associated with the gene of interest  allows the platform to specifically address defects inside the mitochondria using an AAV vector (Adeno-Associated Virus). The gene of interest is transferred into the cell to be expressed and produces the functional protein  which will then be shuttled to the mitochondria through specific nucleotidic sequences in order to restore the missing or deficient mitochondrial function. “LUMEVOQ” was accepted as the invented name for GS010 (lenadogene nolparvovec) by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in October 2018.View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240303717701/en/GenSight BiologicsChief Financial OfficerIvan Tortetitortet@GENSIGHT-BIOLOGICS.comLifeSci AdvisorsInvestor RelationsGuillaume van Renterghemgvanrenterghem@lifesciadvisors.com+41 (0)76 735 01 31,neutral,0.03,0.96,0.01,negative,0.01,0.23,0.76,True,English,"['LUMEVOQ® Scientific Updates', 'GenSight Biologics', 'NANOS 2024', 'Leading Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy', 'maternally inherited mitochondrial genetic disease', 'GenSight Biologics’ lead product candidate', 'm.11778G>A MT-ND4 LHON', 'Scientific Platform Session III Time', 'North American Neuro-Ophthalmology Society', 'two core technology platforms', 'central nervous system disorders', 'GenSight Biologics’ product candidates', 'Institut de la Vision', 'sustainable functional visual recovery', 'poor functional visual recovery', 'GenSight Biologics S.A.', 'lenadogene nolparvovec gene therapy', 'Alfredo A.

Those in Germany were the second most confident (61% versus 13%)  and even in Italy  the least confident of the seven nations  there were almost four times as many travellers expecting increased budgets (44%) as those anticipating reduced budgets (12%).The number of overseas leisure trips people expect to take is slightly up over the number they took last year  and international “workation” or “bleisure” trips – that is  trips that combine both business and leisure – will also see an increase. With working patterns increasingly flexible and employers ever-more willing to enable greater latitude around their employees’ work trips  a noteworthy one in five European travellers (19%) expects to take at least one trip combining work and play in 2024.The hotspots of southern Europe are still top of the list for European travellers  with one in four (23%) planning a trip to Spain this year  followed by Italy (18%)  France (16%)  Portugal and Greece (13%). Outside of Europe  16% of European travellers intend to take a trip to North or Central America this year  with the same proportion planning a trip to Asia.Cost pressures despite confidenceWhile spending more overall  finances aren’t far from consumers’ thoughts – with the vast majority (87%) taking measures to reduce costs where they can as a result of inflation and a heightened cost of living. From opting for more affordable accommodation (27%) to reducing their spending money (27%)  cost-saving measures may shape travel offerings in the year ahead.Climate consciousnessSeven in ten travellers (71%) say sustainability is important to their travel decisions. Of the European countries sampled  travellers in Italy are the most focused on green travel  with 82% claiming that having sustainable options is important to their decision-making process. This is followed by Spain (78%) and Poland (77%)  with British travellers lagging behind (61%).Three in four travellers (77%) say climate concerns will have an actual impact on their travel or booking behaviour. Actions people will take include travelling less frequently (11%); flying less (14%); and actively seeking sustainable accommodation providers or tour operators (10%).However  despite their good intentions  travellers acknowledge that there are obstacles preventing them from making sustainable travel choices  including conflicting cost pressures  cited by 38% of respondents  and a perceived lack of information (23%).Longer peak seasonClimate change is also partially contributing to another trend; peak season avoidance. One in three respondents across Europe (32%) say they will purposefully take a holiday outside peak season to reduce costs; while one in five (19%) expects to do so to avoid the risk of heat waves  such as those seen last summer in southern Europe.Some warm weather destinations may see a longer tourism season as a result  with some tour operators already offering holidays in warmer destinations.Spheres of influenceTravellers take recommendations from friends and family first around where to go on holiday  with 35% saying their recommendations influence their holiday plans  followed by 29% who are swayed by online reviews on sites such as TripAdvisor or hotel websites.Loyalty also counts.

Being a member of the loyalty programme of a particular accommodation provider or tour operator is also crucial for 6% of respondents.One in six (16%) are influenced by destinations they have seen on TV programmes or movies. “Set-jetting”  the trend for holidays to TV show or movie filming locations  has been popularised with influxes of visitors to landscapes made famous by shows such as The White Lotus and Game of Thrones. Some travel firms have even created TV-inspired itineraries and experiences to capture the interest.Some 12% of respondents are influenced by destinations they have seen on social media – the same as those who are influenced by advice from a travel agent.Hotel heavenHotels dominate as the most popular type of holiday accommodation for European travellers  with two-thirds (65%) planning to check-in in 2024. When it comes to picking a hotel  cost and location are understandably the most important factors. However  travellers are also drawn to hotels that offer great in-person service  with 21% citing it as a key factor when booking a stay. Other booking drivers include great food and drink (37%)  great ambiance (17%) and embracing the local destination (11%).Other insights and trends revealed in the report include:Solo travellers: 17% of European travellers will go on a solo trip in 2024.17% of European travellers will go on a solo trip in 2024.

(Euronext Amsterdam: VVY; NL00150002Q7) (Vivoryon)  a clinical stage company focused on the discovery and development of small molecule medicines to modulate the activity and stability of pathologically altered proteins  today announced topline results from its Phase 2b European VIVIAD study of varoglutamstat (PQ912)  an investigational oral glutaminyl cyclase (QPCT) inhibitor in development for the treatment of early Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The VIVIAD study did not meet its primary endpoint and did not show a statistically significant difference in change over time on cognition  as measured by a combined score (Z-score) of the Detection test  the Identification test and the ‘One Back’ test (attention and working memory domains) of the Cogstate neuropsychological test battery (NTB)  called “Cogstate 3-item scale”. Additionally  the study did not meet key secondary endpoints measuring cognition (Cogstate Brief Battery  CBB  and complete Cogstate NTB)  Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Questionnaire (A-IADL-Q) and electroencephalogram (EEG) global theta power. Varoglutamstat was generally well tolerated and showed rates similar to placebo of serious and severe treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs)  low discontinuation rates due to adverse events and no evidence of symptomatic ARIAs (amyloid-related imaging abnormalities) in the clinical setting.The Company is conducting an in-depth analysis of the results  including analyses of additional pre-specified exploratory endpoints (e.g. WAIS-IV coding test  executive function and episodic memory domains  Winterlight Labs speech assessment  cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers and additional EEG analysis) and distinct patient cohorts as defined in the statistical analysis plan  including ApoE4 status  tau level  dose level and pre-treatment.“We are profoundly disappointed by the outcome of the VIVIAD Phase 2b study of varoglutamstat in the early AD patient population given the huge unmet need for new safe and effective oral therapies ” said Frank Weber  M.D.  CEO of Vivoryon. “I would like to express our gratitude to the patients  their families and caregivers  as well as the investigators for participating in the VIVIAD study  and to our incredible team at Vivoryon for their tireless efforts. While these results are not what we had hoped for  VIVIAD is a comprehensive  diligently designed and high-quality study and we are doing all we can to fully analyze the dataset as quickly as possible to gain insights into key findings that might influence varoglutamstat clinical development and help advance the science and understanding of this devastating disease.”A further update is expected to be provided no later than with the publication of the Company’s full year 2023 financial results which are expected in mid to late April 2024.###About VaroglutamstatVaroglutamstat (PQ912) is a differentiated oral small-molecule targeting the toxic Abeta species N3pE which is being developed as disease-modifying therapy and is designed to target AD pathology upstream of Abeta-antibody focused approaches. Varoglutamstat blocks the enzyme glutaminyl cyclase (QPCT) and its isoenzyme QPCTL. QPCT catalyzes the formation of N3pE amyloid  a particularly neurotoxic variant of Abeta peptides  which is only found in patients with AD and not present in the brains of healthy individuals. N3pE amyloid in the brain acts as a seeding element for Abeta aggregation  thus providing a starting point for plaque formation. It has been described to correlate with the cognitive ability of patients with AD. Beyond Abeta pathology  varoglutamstat has also been shown to impact synaptic impairment. Through a second mode of action  the inhibition of full CCL2 maturation via QPCTL  varoglutamstat modulates pro-inflammatory signaling and tau pathology  thereby simultaneously addressing multiple hallmarks of AD. Vivoryon has received Fast Track designation for varoglutamstat in early AD by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It is being investigated in two Phase 2 clinical studies  one in Europe (VIVIAD  NCT04498650) and one in the U.S. (VIVA-MIND  NCT03919162). Varoglutamstat has not yet been approved by any regulatory authority and the safety and efficacy have not yet been established.About VIVIADVIVIAD is a state-of-the-art Phase 2b study conducted in Europe and designed to evaluate the safety  tolerability  and efficacy of varoglutamstat in 259 participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild AD (collectively referred to as “early AD”). The primary endpoint is the change over time on working memory and attention as measured by a combined score (Z-score) of the Detection test  the Identification test and the ‘One Back’ test (attention and working memory domains) of the Cogstate neuropsychological test battery (NTB)  called “Cogstate 3-item scale”. Key secondary efficacy endpoints include in hierarchical order: Cogstate Brief Battery (CBB  4-item scale)  the complete Cogstate NTB (8-item scale)  the Amsterdam Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Questionnaire (A-IADL-Q)  and electroencephalogram (EEG) global theta power.About Vivoryon Therapeutics N.V.Vivoryon is a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on developing innovative small molecule-based medicines. Driven by our passion for ground-breaking science and innovation  we strive to change the lives of patients in need suffering from severe diseases. We leverage our in-depth expertise in understanding post-translational modifications to develop medicines that modulate the activity and stability of proteins which are altered in disease settings. Beyond our lead program  varoglutamstat  which is in Phase 2 clinical development to treat Alzheimer’s disease  we have established a solid pipeline of orally available small molecule inhibitors for various indications including cancer  inflammatory diseases and fibrosis. www.vivoryon.comVivoryon Forward Looking StatementsThis press release includes forward-looking statements  including  without limitation  those regarding the business strategy  management plans and objectives for future operations of the Vivoryon Therapeutics N.V.

Coface has laid strong foundations which will support its development. It has indeed: Built a best in industry risk infrastructure Developed a high-performance sales organisation in key markets Simplified its operating model Established Business Information services (BI) foundations Defined a clear Corporate Social Responsibility roadmap Nurtured a strong leadership cultureThe new plan will deepen and broaden the quality of Coface’s franchise. Its targets are  in particular  to:Reach data and technology excellence Deepen and broaden Coface’s historical Trade Credit Insurance (TCI) franchise Grow profitably Business Information services at double digit growth rate Leverage its unique culture of a human-sized multinational with a strong commitment to sustainabilityCoface  again  raises its through-the-cycle financial targets:An undiscounted combined ratio at ~78% through-the-cycle  a 2 ppts improvement compared to Build to Lead A RoATE of 11.0% through-the-cycle  an increase of 1.5 pt at the current level of interest rate environment A solvency ratio towards the upper end of the 155%-175% target range with a payout ratio of at least 80% An additional contribution from Business Information services to group RoATE of 50bp starting in 2027Xavier Durand  Coface’s Chief Executive Officer  commented:“The numerous successes of our strategic plans Fit to Win and Build to Lead have built solid foundations for Coface. We have demonstrated that our businesses complement each other  allowing for the development of a credit risk management ecosystem of reference to increase our value proposition to our customers.Our new plan Power the Core aims at building upon our strengths and our employees’ commitment and expertise in order to accelerate our transformation. We will in particular deliberately invest in data and technology  for our Trade Credit Insurance and our Business Information services. We will further reinforce our leadership in credit insurance while pursuing a double-digit profitable growth in information services.In order to reach these ambitious targets  we will leverage our unique culture of a human-sized multinational  dedicated to its clients and deeply committed to our responsibilities in sustainability matters.We are again upgrading our through-the-cycle financial targets and are now targeting an additional positive 50bp contribution from Business Information services to the group RoATE starting in 2027.Our employees’ and partners’ commitment will be  like for our previous plan a critical pillar of our collective success at the service of our clients.”1. Strong foundations: Build to Lead has met or exceeded all of its targetsOur Build to Lead plan was presented in February 2020. Its execution happened in a particularly shaky environment: pandemic  inflation outbreak  brutal rise in interest rates  war coming back in Europe. Coface has stuck with its strategic direction and was able to rely on its agility to reach or exceed  all of its plan’s targets.Beyond the financial targets  Coface has simplified its operating model  notably by reducing the number of IT systems by 40% and by decreasing its IT complexity index by 25%.Over the 2020-2023 period  Coface’s combined ratio was significantly reduced and reached 69.1% on average  a level well below the Build to Lead target and at the best level in the industry. The cost ratio constantly decreased while the loss ratio benefited from past investments in the risk management infrastructure.Revenues grew on average by 6% per annum  supported by a record retention and by our clients’ turnover growth.Over the last 4 years  return on average tangible equity was 10.8%  above the 9.5% target.Finally  despite the numerous shocks  be it economic  financial  or political  Coface’s solvency has constantly remained above its target range which permitted to Coface to be in 2020 one of the very first European insurance companies to restart  with a share buyback  returns to shareholders.In 2019  the Business Information services were still relatively immature. Since then  they pursued their development and confirmed their growth potential. This activity has strong synergies with Trade Credit Insurance and relies on the same risk infrastructure. It is currently profitable despite significant growth investments. The growth of this pure service activity  which requires no regulatory capital  reached 13% on average between 2019 and 2023.2. Power the Core aims at developing a global credit risk management ecosystem of referenceCoface’s conviction is intact: Trade Credit Insurance is a service business which exhibits high barriers to entry  is growing and among which Coface has built the best risk infrastructure in the market. The latter relies on proprietary data and scores  a global reach  a worldwide technology platform  a through-the-cycle underwriting experience  a robust regulatory and legal set up and a strong balance sheet.Our strategic plan Power the Core will thus  relying on these strong foundations  broaden and deepen Coface’s franchises. In particular  it will:Invest deliberately in data and technology to build new differentiating data and scoring capabilities  integrating the most modern modelling techniques  data science and artificial intelligence in particular. Investments will be specifically oriented towards technology and connectivity for the benefit of our clients.Deepen and broaden our TCI franchise. Risk underwriting will remain disciplined while we will continue to invest for growth  especially on the SME and Mid-market segments  and deliver on the simplification of the customer experience.Pursue profitable double-digit growth in Business Information services. We will invest to keep building sales teams with consistency  broaden data sourcing  expand use cases  and upgrade IT platforms. Leverage Coface’s unique culture. We will further enhance attractive employer value proposition and deliver on our CSR commitments.3. Power the Core will give Coface ambitious financial targets for 2027 and beyondThe rigorous execution of the strategic plan will allow Coface to reach its improved through-the-cycle financial targets:An undiscounted combined ratio of ~78% through-the-cycle  a 2 ppts improvement compared to the previous planA return on average tangible equity of 11.0% through-the-cycle.

It's great to have people here in Paternoster Square  and welcome to those who are joining us online. I'm here with Anna  and we are also joined by Michel-Alain Proch  or MAP as he is widely known  who has joined us this week as our new CFO. We have had a very good 2023. We delivered at the top end of our growth guidance for the year and have compounded organic growth at 6.5% over the last 3 years. We also accelerated within 2023  exceeding the year with organic growth at 8.5% in Q4. So this is a great setup as we head into 2024. I'm pleased to say that we've met or exceeded all of our Refinitiv acquisition targets  which Anna will talk you through in a moment. Cash generation was very strong  with all of our profit converted to cash. This means we can invest in growth and our platform and still have significant excess capital to return to investors. You have seen us do this with over £1 billion of buybacks in the past year and further growth in our dividend announced today. At our Capital Markets Day in November  we set new upgraded targets for growth with an acceleration over the medium term. I'll give more detail on our progress and our plans in a few moments. First  though  let me hand over to Anna to take you through our 2023 financial performance.Anna Manz: Thanks  David  and good morning. 2023 marked the end of our initial guidance period following the Refinitiv acquisition. And I'm pleased to say that  thanks to a strong track record of performance  we've beaten all of our acquisition targets. We've delivered good cash generation and have been active in our approach to capital allocation. Looking forward  we're confident in our delivery of our upgraded medium-term guidance. So let's start with the performance against our 3-year Refinitiv acquisition targets. Income growth has been consistently at the upper end of our 5% to 7% range. And our organic growth has accelerated through the period from 6.1% in 2021 to 7.1% in 2023. Excluding the impact of the Ukraine-Russia conflict  our 3-year organic income CAGR was 6.5%. Our 2023 margin on a like-for-like basis  and that's reflecting a constant perimeter from the time that guidance was set  was 50.3%  ahead of our guidance of a 50% exit run rate. There's a bridge in the appendix  which walks you through the perimeter changes. These changes strengthen our business for the future. Turning to revenue synergies. Here  we're on track to deliver against our upgraded targets. For 2023  we aim to double the prior year run rate of £68 million. In fact  we've significantly exceeded that  exiting the year at a run rate of £158 million. Our cost synergy program is largely complete  with a bit more to come in 2024. We're well ahead of the upgraded targets with a run rate of £442 million. In short  we've delivered against all of our acquisition targets. Now for the rest of this presentation  I will  as usual  focus on constant currency growth rates  and you can see the strength of our 2023 performance on this slide. Total income  excluding recoveries  rose up by over 8%  and EBITDA was up nearly 9%. Depreciation and amortization was up about 11%. There's 2 drivers of this. Firstly  we've continued to invest at a high level. And secondly  during 2023  we've embedded a more agile product engineering culture  and this means we're delivering product to our customers faster in regular releases  and we're starting to depreciate earlier. The accelerated -- this accelerated depreciation in 2023 and will have a further impact in 2024. Growth in adjusted operating profit was about 8%  fairly consistent with EBITDA growth. Turning to the lower half of the P&L on the next slide. Our finance expense includes £30 million of FX losses  mainly related to the group's funding arrangements. Previously  these FX movements were included in operating expense  and this change is to bring us in line with best practice disclosure. £16 million of the £30 million relates to the first half  which at the time was reported in OpEx. Our effective tax rate has gone up 2.2 percentage points from last year  and that reflects the higher U.K. corporate tax rate in place from April 2023. Tradeweb and LCH performed strongly in the year  and this has resulted in higher profit attributable to noncontrolling interests. The combination of depreciation  FX impacts and higher tax has impacted our EPS performance relative to EBITDA. All our divisions grew well. Data & Analytics grew 7.3%  with higher pricing  improved retention and stronger sales. Capital Markets grew 6.1%  with good growth at Tradeweb  partly offset by market driven weakness in equities and FX. Post Trade had an exceptional year  up 17%  as interest rate uncertainty drove strong client demand for our SwapClear services. And there was also a contribution from M&A. Let's start with Data & Analytics  where all of our businesses performed well. Trading & Banking grew over 3% this year or 2.5% organically. We've turned around a business that had been in decline for over a decade to one achieving consistent solid growth for the last 2 years. And we continue to get better and better feedback on Workspace  as David will cover later. This improved product delivered better price realization and higher retention. Enterprise Data grew strongly  up over 9%  driven by demand for our proprietary real-time data. Within Investment Solutions  subscription revenues have accelerated  and we've seen double-digit growth this year. Improved sales execution is driving a better customer experience and helping us meet the strong demand for our core benchmark products. We also saw a recovery in asset-based revenues over the year  with Q4 up 11%. Assets under management at year-end were 23% higher than December 2022. Wealth was up 4%  driven by digital solutions  where we have seen sustained demand for data feeds. Customer & Third-Party Risk grew 16%. World-Check continued to show excellent growth  benefiting from both regulatory and reputational risk management tailwinds. Turning to ASV. ASV growth continues to be good evidence of the improvements we're making in our business. Subscription revenues in Data & Analytics are growing nearly 4% faster than when we acquired Refinitiv. ASV growth was 6.7% at the end of the year. As we saw over the course of the year  this metric will fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter. So while it remains indicative of future growth  it won't always perfectly align. The 6.7% in December includes a small impact of Credit Suisse  with some more to come in the first half of 2024. We continue to monitor our sales metrics closely  and they remain strong. And David will talk more about that in a minute. Turning to Capital Markets. We grew 6.1%. Equity revenues declined due to market conditions  as 2023 was a pretty weak year globally for equities. In FX  market volumes were also weaker  impacting activity across both FXall and Matching. In fixed income  Tradeweb  which drives over 2/3 of our Capital Markets revenues  saw record transaction volumes in both rates and credit. Variable fees per million were lower due to product mix and a skew towards shorter-duration instruments. So overall  revenue growth is a bit behind volumes  but still very strong and accelerating in the second half. Our Post Trade business delivered an exceptional performance  up 17%. Interest rate volatility drove strong client demand for SwapClear services  and that was the primary driver of the organic growth in OTC Derivatives. In addition  we helped our clients through U.S. LIBOR reference rate reform  contributing £18 million in onetime revenues. The acquisitions of Acadia and Quantile  which round out our Post Trade solutions offering  contributed a further 15% to OTC Derivatives growth. Securities & Reporting grew 7%  as revenues relating to the early termination of the Euronext clearing agreement more than offset the in-year impact of the business lost. And we also saw strength in RepoClear. Net treasury income was up nearly 13%  as interest margins benefited from the shape of the yield curve in 2023. We saw higher levels of cash collateral in the first half  which moderated in the second half  as balances normalized and members optimize their collateral between cash and noncash. Turning to costs on Slide 13. Before I go into the drivers of our cost growth  I want to touch on FX. In 2022  you'll remember  we had a £68 million benefit in OpEx. And this year  we saw an adverse impact of £42 million. These FX impacts are a result of being a global organization operating in over 170 countries. And that's why constant currency growth rates are a better indicator of underlying performance. Organic cost growth of 5.3% was broadly balanced between ongoing operating costs and investment for growth. Average pay increases in 2023 were around 6%. But at the same time  we've delivered further cost synergies  which partly offset this. Acquisitions added 2.4% to our cost growth. Ongoing operating cost growth reduced from 6.4% in the first half to 3% in the second half. This reflects the phasing of investment and efficiencies. Looking ahead  Refinitiv synergies will continue to benefit us in 2024  but that's not the end of the efficiency opportunity. Our broader transformation program is building a more scalable platform  which will deliver cost efficiencies over the medium term. Turning to margins on Slide 14. We delivered an EBITDA margin of 47.2%  which included a 110 basis point improvement in our underlying efficiency. As I mentioned earlier  the FX-related items are impacting margins in both years  and the impact is clearly shown in the table on this slide. We're laying out our 2023 EBITDA margin guidance. I explained how our investment with Microsoft and recent acquisitions would impact this year's margin. And you can see that the impact was 120 basis points. Our guidance was set excluding the Acadia acquisition and FX. On this basis  we delivered an in-year margin of 48%  in line with guidance. The reconciling items between adjusted and reporting operated profit relate to the acquisitions that we've closed over the last few years  and most materially Refinitiv. The £69 million remeasurement gain relates to the fair value adjustment of our previously held 14% in Acadia. Moving from the P&L to cash flow. Our business is highly cash generative  as you can see on Slide 16. We delivered £3.2 billion of operating cash in the year. As a reminder  the CapEx figure here is the cash cost of both business as usual and integration CapEx. Equity free cash flow was again substantial at £1.8 billion  and we converted all of our profit into cash this year. Let's look at how we're deploying this capital on the next slide. We continue to deploy our strong cash generation back into the business for future growth  whilst also returning any excess to shareholders. The level of CapEx reflects the transformation we're driving in our business and investments in our broad range of growth opportunities. On dividends  we're proposing a final dividend of 79.3p  totaling 115p for the year  up 7.5% from last year. We completed the acquisitions of Acadia and Yieldbroker and the buyout of the LCH SA minorities in the year. We returned £1.2 billion to shareholders via share buybacks in the year. We carried out the remaining £450 million of the on-market buyback announced in 2022  followed by a £750 million directed buyback  targeting the former Refinitiv shareholders. At our Capital Markets Day in November  we announced a further £1 billion share buyback in 2024. As we announced this morning  we intend to do that through directed buybacks from the former Refinitiv shareholders. Looking ahead  we're reiterating our upgraded medium-term targets that we announced at our Capital Markets Day. We expect revenue to grow organically at mid- to high single digits  accelerating after 2024. 2024 is impacted by a number of known one-offs  including Credit Suisse and the Euronet clearing termination. These impacts are well understood and reflected in consensus. We expect underlying EBITDA margin to increase over time. The improvement won't be linear because it will depend partly on the phasing of investments and efficiencies. With regards to CapEx  for 2024  this will remain at current levels of 11% to 12% of income  reducing over time to high single digits as a percentage of income. And lastly  over the medium term  our cumulative free cash flow will exceed net income. For 2024  we're confident of continued growth and improving profitability  in line with our medium-term guidance. And we expect the adjusted tax rate to be 24% to 25%. As noted at the CMD  we'll be moving to our new reporting structure from the first quarter. So in summary  we built a strong track record of performance and met and beat -- or beaten all of our Refinitiv acquisition targets. 2023 was another great year of delivery across the top line and in profitability. And we continue to be very active and thoughtful about how we allocate capital  combining investments in the long-term growth with returns today. It's been a privilege and a pleasure to be part of the LSEG journey these last few years  and now I see the transformation that we've been driving. I'll be eagerly watching the group deliver the next phase of growth. And with that  David.David Schwimmer: Thank you  Anna. Now we gave you a pretty detailed update at the CMD back in November  so for the next few minutes  I want to briefly look at our plans for accelerating growth in three key ways: one  by delighting our customers  improving retention and pricing power as a result; two  by transforming our sales and account management approach to deepen and scale our customer relationships; and three  by improving existing products and bringing new solutions to market. These are the building blocks of our growth goal  to deliver mid- to high single-digit growth accelerating after this year. So first  our customers are recognizing the ongoing transformation of our business and our products. Customer satisfaction is up across all of our key products  with the biggest improvement seen in our largest accounts. Our customers also tell us they feel better informed about our products and find it easier to get things done. We are significantly improving our customer service. We've already reduced the time it takes us to resolve customer queries by 25%  and we plan to lower it much more. Second  we are deepening and scaling our relationships. You've heard us talk before about the success we've been having with our key strategic accounts  those 20 or so global institutions that are our biggest customers. The combination of LSEG and Refinitiv has created a truly strategic partner  and we have resourced our account management to reflect that. These relationships involve regular top-to-top dialogues and more strategic partnerships that have led to faster growth from our biggest customers. The Design Partner Programme with Microsoft is a great example of this. We're now putting in place a similar account coverage program for our top 250 accounts. Across all of these accounts  we are focused on solution selling  a comprehensive sales training program selling the LSEG way is on target for global rollout completion by the end of next month. And then for our smaller customers  we are improving how we serve them by consolidating and standardizing our approach. We have already migrated 10 000 customers to be served out of 3 global hubs  with 2 further hubs to follow. At the end of last year  we launched our e-commerce platform  empowering our smaller customers to self-serve and giving us a tool to upsell and cross-sell much more effectively. We will be launching new products onto that platform throughout 2024. And as you know  we continue to keep a close eye on sales cycle trends. The data remained very consistent with what we shared at the first half. Deal sizes are up year-on-year  win rates are up strongly since acquisition  and we are not seeing any lengthening in those cycles. And now onto product  where I'll update you on what we're doing and the breadth of opportunity in front of us. You'll recognize this slide from the CMD. It underlines the waves of growth as they contribute to our acceleration. Half of LSEG  Enterprise Data  Tradeweb and Post Trade are businesses driving industry-leading growth. Another set of businesses  such as Trading & Banking and Investment Solutions  have great market positions and are the focus of investment programs to make them even better. And then we have our partnerships with Microsoft and with the world's leading financial institutions  where we are transforming the industry. Let's look at Enterprise Data first  which is just under 1/5 of our revenue. This has been a continuing success story  building on our leadership in real time and our growing share in pricing and reference services. Our continuing investment in content is driving strong growth. We're having real success with fixed income and evaluated pricing data. A recent major win with an Asian bank reflects the new LSEG's unrivaled breadth and depth as well as the quality of our data set. This was business that Refinitiv lost to a competitor pre-LSEG  largely because of that competitor's extremely aggressive pricing. But this customer has come back to LSEG because of the quality of our product. Our real-time optimized service in the cloud now has over 500 new customers since its launch a couple of years ago and opens up a real-time service to many more customers who previously would not have invested in on-premise infrastructure to take the service. We're also seeing growing demand for data management and storage  which is an encouraging sign for our move into this space with Microsoft. Looking ahead  we are expanding on the same winning formula. We're investing in our content  transforming our data operations  so we can onboard data much more efficiently and accurately. And as we make it easier for customers to access and combine data sets and drive insights from them  usage and value are only going to increase. Moving to Tradeweb  which is about 13% of our revenue. It was another strong year  with a notable acceleration in the second half. This business has a number of really strong growth vectors. Overall  electronification is an ongoing tailwind  but when the team is adding to with market share gains  particularly in credit  where Tradeweb represents 1/4 of the high-grade credit market. Innovation in core markets continues  as does international expansion. In 2023  Tradeweb moved into the Australian market with the acquisition of Yieldbroker. Looking at 2024  Tradeweb is adding more trading tools  pushing further into emerging markets where electronification is in its very early stages and looking to make further share gains in credit. Overall  we've stepped up the level of collaboration between Tradeweb and the rest of LSEG  building better products for our customers. The Russell partnership and the integration with FXall are great examples of this  but there is much more to go for. Turning to our businesses where we are driving improvement through investment. Trading & Banking has probably been the area with the most upside surprise for our investors. After years of revenue declines  it's fair to say that expectations of a turnaround were low  but we have now delivered 8 straight quarters of organic growth. What's changed? Put simply  Workspace is a great product  and we are continuing to improve it week in and week out. In 2023 alone  we made nearly 400 updates. We integrated some of the TORA functionality  and we launched the AI-driven advanced dealing for FX. Customers with multiple desktop services are spending 59% of their time on Workspace compared to 43% for Eikon  and that is showing up in improved retention and better pricing. We also continue to make inroads in volumes and competitor displacements. UniCredit is a great example of this. They were lining up to cancel  but they saw how good and cost-effective the new product was. And we are confident that this progress can continue. As you know  we plan to have nearly all of Eikon customers migrated to Workspace by the end of this year before sunsetting Eikon in 2025. And the first applications from the Microsoft partnership will be in customers' hands in the first half of this year  with Meeting Prep and Open Directory pilots scheduled for the next month or 2. Now we have also seen improving performance in our FTSE Russell index business  which forms the bulk of investment solutions. We are selling more to our existing customers  and we have also generated significant Refinitiv revenue synergies as we link index sales to underlying data subscriptions much more effectively. Together  these measures have led to an acceleration in subscription revenue in 2023  as you can see on the right. Looking to 2024 and beyond  we see further growth from better commercialization of our existing products and improve distribution  both through partnerships and technology. On top of that  we'll improve functionality as we complete our index refactoring program  accelerating time to market and giving our customers better tools and functionality. Now moving on to our truly transformational opportunities  where we are making a step change to our addressable markets through deep partnership with the industry. For Post Trade  it's worth reflecting on 2023 before we go on to the new opportunities in '24 and beyond. The division achieved total income growth of over 17% and 12% on an organic basis. Not bad for a supposedly mature business. That extends a double-digit compound growth record over 5 years. In addition to market volatility  the drivers were continued expansion with our first 2 Singaporean members onboarded  product innovation and a strong demonstration of our partnership credentials. We helped our customers migrate 600 000 contracts worth $45 trillion from LIBOR to SOFR in the first half of the year. Looking ahead  we will continue to innovate in our core clearing business  with a move into clearing of derivatives on digital assets  CDS in the U.S. market and the development of our FX forward service. But the big opportunity is in Post Trade solutions. We thought it would be useful on this slide just to frame the opportunity in the simplest way possible. Over the last 10 years  LCH has achieved extraordinary growth  tripling revenues and increasing profit 6x. It now generates well over £1 billion in revenue and is still growing. Almost all of its income is generated from clearing  but this is only half of the OTC Derivatives market  as you can see from the pie chart. At the end of 2022  the total value of OTC Derivatives contracts outstanding was $21 trillion. Obviously  the amount traded during a year is many multiples of that. Almost all of that cleared business is in swaps  where  as you know  we are the market leader. Two important changes are taking place in the industry. First  regulations such as SCR  are making it much more expensive from a capital perspective for banks to enter into bilateral trades. We think this will see more and more business migrate to clearing over time  as liquidity improves and the relative cost comes down. Note that FX  the second biggest OTC market  is still over 90% uncleared. Second  the industry is crying out for common standards in the uncleared space. Participants want a consistent framework for contracting  documentation  valuation and dispute resolution  and they want us to provide that. We are combining our existing SwapAgent business with Quantile  which offers trade compression and optimization across multiple counterparties and with Acadia  which provides risk management  margining and collateral services for uncleared markets. Together  these businesses offer a full suite of services to manage risk and capital efficiency across the whole OTC market  i.e.  cleared and uncleared. So we are effectively doubling our market opportunity. And finally  a brief update on our Microsoft partnership. We covered this in some detail at the CMD  but progress continues to be encouraging  and we are very close to having product in the hands of our customers a few months ahead of our original plan. Now I know you have found the demo videos that we have shared in the past very helpful in visualizing the types of service we will be providing. So here is another one. This is actually a recording of a live demo done by Nej D'Jelal  our Head of Workspace to our Board. And it shows the integration of Workspace with Meeting Prep and the broader Teams suite and just how flexible and embedded it is. So please play the video. [Presentation]David Schwimmer: So pretty powerful in terms of that embedded nature. And one point to note that the video doesn't emphasize Meeting Prep uses Microsoft's AI to combine our data with the customers' own data in their e-mail  other files or CRM system to write those briefing materials. We are rolling out pilots of these 2 customers over the course of the next month or 2. As we've said before  the first meaningful revenues from the partnership will begin to flow in 2025. We have gotten some questions as to how we will commercialize these products. We will get paid for usage of our data and Workspace licenses. Microsoft revenue will come from cloud consumption and their licenses. Of course  the precise commercial model will vary from product to product and will also depend on the distribution mechanism  whether that's through our sales organization or Microsoft's enterprise relationships. But the bigger point is clear. We are developing products will -- which will significantly enhance insight and efficiency for financial markets participants  and the value proposition will be compelling. And as we highlighted at the CMD  we see at least 2 significant new opportunities opening up for us: first  an adjacent TAM of around £50 billion in data management services; and second  penetrating the 300 million-plus Teams user base with our data. So to sum up  in 2023  we drove growth in all of our divisions  with acceleration through each quarter. We made significant strategic progress through the Refinitiv integration benefits  the deeper collaboration across the group  the investments in our platforms and our partnership with Microsoft. We have an exciting set of plans to accelerate growth and are confident of executing on them. And we will continue to allocate capital actively for growth and shareholder returns. Now  we're very happy to take your questions  which Peregrine will moderate. And I already see hands popping up.A - Peregrine Riviere: Thank you  David. Morning  everyone. So we'll take the questions in the room first  and then we'll go to the conference line. So Tom  I saw you first.Thomas Mills: Thanks very much. It's Tom Mills from Jefferies. So I saw the FCA's wholesale data market study  final report also came out this morning. I guess  nobody has really had that much time to look through it in much detail. But I mean  certainly  the headlines look fairly neutral from a sort of outcomes perspective. I just wondered if you had any other takes beyond that. And then I also wanted to pick up on the demo that you just showed there. Is it right to think that people would -- or users would need to sort of pay the additional Copilot subscription with Microsoft in order to get the benefits that you show there? And I guess  some of the early feedback on Copilot had been that people found it interesting  but perhaps didn't meet the $30 a month price tag that it sort of currently applies. Do you think that the sort of additional capabilities within Workspace will significantly add to what it has to offer? Thank you.David Schwimmer: So I'll take your second question first. Short answer is  I think  yes. I think this is a very clear use case that is going to add significant efficiency to users. I think we all know how much time is spent in terms of preparing for meetings  and the notion that you can have a pretty effective briefing memo prepared in about 15 seconds is going to be pretty compelling. So I think that it will prove to be an attractive element  both from a Microsoft perspective  but also in terms of users of our data. Just a point to mention on that. If you are not a user of Refinitiv data and you have access to the Microsoft product and you are using Meeting Prep  you will be given access to basically a teaser element of our data and then a link to accessing more of our data via subscription. So we see that as a very interesting opening to a larger set of Microsoft customers. On your first question really around the FCA  I took a quick look at it this morning. For those of you who haven't seen it  it indicates there will be no -- I think the phrase they used was no significant intervention in the markets  but that they will continue to focus on fair and -- fair  reasonable and transparent distribution of data. That's exactly how we approach data. We are both a provider of and a consumer of data. So we look at it from both sides and try to take that fair and reasonable and transparent approach at all times. So again  early days  just came out this morning  but it looks to be not a material event from our perspective and one where we will continue to work with the FCA.Thomas Mills: Can I just check on the first point you made? Is it the case that people would need to take the CopIlot subscription to benefit from what we saw in the demo there?David Schwimmer: At this point  yes. But I can't speak for Microsoft in terms of whether they may modify that over time.Thomas Mills: Okay. Thank you.Peregrine Riviere: Enrico?Enrico Bolzoni: Thank you. It's Enrico Bolzoni  JPMorgan. A couple of questions from me. So one  again  related to the demo you showed us. I would like to understand  from your point of view  where is the biggest opportunity in terms of winning market share? And I'm referring to the different divisions within banks  for example. So you have markets historically that have been adopter of Bloomberg. My understanding is very difficult to displace those. This product seems to be more targeted to investment banking  possibly or other -- I guess  other division within banks. Can you just give us some color whether you think you can generally take market share with the partnership  at least in the early phases? My second question relates to the synergies. I mean  clearly  you are ahead of your original schedule. You gave us an indication of the -- where the run rates were towards the end of the year. What should we expect for 2024? So where -- related to that  were this run rate achieved towards the very end of the year? So should we expect already from first  second quarter a meaningful benefit from a cost and revenue standpoint? And then finally  among the things you mentioned  you have this e-commerce opportunity to service smaller clients. And I was thinking whether it relates also to clients that might be served better with the cloud -- adoption of the cloud technology. So can you just remind us what is the addressable market there? What is the opportunity for revenue?David Schwimmer: Sure. Maybe I'll take your first and third  and if you want to touch on the synergies. So in terms of where we look to be taking market share within different segments in Capital Markets  we're not limiting it and we're not targeting it at any one area. You may see in our different demos a use case that may be more relevant for investment banking or for trading or for wealth or for data management. But we think this is going to be a kind of step-change product that is going to be significantly better in terms of the user experience  in terms of the flexibility  in terms of the availability of data  analytics  workflow. And so I think that the market opportunities apply across banking  wealth  trading  corporates  and we have seen that kind of interest. As you know  we have the Design Partner Programme where we are working with a number of our biggest customers  and we're not working with any one division of those big institutions. These are both buy side and sell side. We are working with them across their different segments. On e-commerce  the real opportunity here is to have our sales force work much  much more effectively and efficiently. So if we have tens of thousands of customers  in the past  we used to deal with all of them in basically the same way  i.e.  human intervention  so we could have a human dealing with a very large international bank that we might have hundreds of millions of dollars or pounds of business with  and we could also have a human dealing with a small hedge fund that might need a little bit of data and workflow from us. What we are doing is creating the e-commerce capability. So for the long tail of customers that might want a single data set from us  they can access that themselves electronically and do that quickly  efficiently  no human intervention  more efficient for them  more efficient for us. That allows our sales force to focus the human interaction on those who either need more individual help or on the bigger customers  which have more complex needs and requirements. So in terms of the e-commerce platform  we have rolled out a beta version at the end of last year on Workspace for Wealth. And then this year  we have World-Check becoming available on the platform  and then we'll be making more and more product available on it over the course of this year and into next year. Over to you on the synergies question.Anna Manz: Synergies  yes. So just to recap a little bit. So starting with revenue synergies  we've said that we exited the year at £158 million run rate synergies. And you've seen that grow fairly consistently  and it will continue to grow consistently. So I wouldn't look at any specific phasing around that  but really good momentum there. And in terms of cost synergies  we exited the year at £442 million run rate synergies at the end of the year. And we said there's a little bit more to come. So £442 million won't be the final number. It will be a little bit higher. And we'll see the benefits of the annualization of the 400 -- the incremental piece that we've delivered this year  which has been relatively evenly spread  plus the benefits that we'll see from those further synergies flowing through to 2024.Peregrine Riviere: Let's come over to this side. Andy?Andrew Coombs: Thank you. Good morning. It's Andrew Coombs from Citi. Firstly  just wish Anna all the best in her new endeavors. And let's take advantage of that and ask a few numbers questions beforehand.Anna Manz: I knew that this coming.Andrew Coombs: The first thing is just on the ASV metric. You do reference there is some Credit Suisse impact in there. You said that Credit Suisse is well captured for the full year consensus figure. But can you give us an idea of how much you've already recognized in the ASV figure versus how much is still to come? Second question would just be coming back to the OpEx. You made this point that the second half organic growth run rate was notably below the first half in 2023 because of the timing of investments. So when we're thinking ahead to 2024  should we be thinking about the full year run rate as the base or the second half run rate as the base? Intrigued on your thoughts there. And final question on buybacks  just given the reference to the AGM authorizations. Can you just provide us an idea of how many authorizations do you have outstanding still from last year versus the timing of the buyback and  hence  your comment about potentially rolling those at the end of April with the new AGM?David Schwimmer: You do the first. I'll do the third.Anna Manz: Yes. Sure. So with respect to Credit Suisse  just to kind of recap the things that we've said so far  so firstly  we've said it's less than a point of D&A revenue growth in total. And we have said that the effect is fully reflected in 2024 consensus. In terms of ASV  there was a smaller impact in Q4  and there will be a larger impact as we look ahead to first half 2024. In terms of OpEx  I'm afraid I'm not going to give you the detail of the phasing  in part because we work our way through making investments in a thoughtful way  and we don't sort of manage to an overarching number. We manage investing when we've got the teams ready and capable to deliver. Now in terms of phasing  well  firstly  we've given you guidance on margin. It will improve as we look forward to 2024. And in terms of phasing  it would be right to think that the second half growth rate as we exit the year gives you a sense of where we entered the year  and then we'll continue to drive efficiencies and investments as we manage our way through.David Schwimmer: And on your buyback question  the authorization that we guide at last year's AGM goes through the year until this year's AGM. And so we then  to do anything after this year's AGM  need the shareholder vote at this year's AGM.Andrew Coombs: So in terms of launching that directed buyback  there's no constraint when you're doing it before the AGM potentially. It's just you're saying that should you choose to do it after the AGM  you would.David Schwimmer: So the authorization we got at last year's AGM  I believe  was a percentage amount  up to just under 5%. And so then we need to get the new authorization going forward after this year's AGM -- at this year's AGM.Peregrine Riviere: Russell  just behind you  Andrew.Russell Quelch: Hi. Russell Quelch from Redburn Atlantic. I've got a few questions on the go-to-market strategy. And I'm just going to give you these in the order I wrote them down  but you can answer them in any order. When you roll out product  particularly around when you start adding predictive analytics  generative AI into the product suite  and you're moving more  as you mentioned  David  towards the sort of consumption or usage based model  someone called that like a token based pricing model  I wondered how that affect ASV growth given you'll have less visibility at the upfront when you've actually made the -- when you put the contracts on the total size of the contract. That's my number one. In terms of these clients where you've done -- or you're targeting through your 250 clients implementing this new structured enterprise sales approach  can you give us some details on where you're at in that sort of 250  how far you are through? In terms of your investments in the sales team to deliver that  can you give us some idea as to where you are in your spending on your sales team? Is there an incremental expense we should expect in 2024 in the sales teams? And then just any flavor you can give us. I assume you've done some trials with your customers around the new products. So just any flavor you can give us around sort of feedback insights  any statistics you can share from some of those trials. Thanks.David Schwimmer: Okay. Let me see how much of that we can tackle. So your first question around moving to a consumption-based model  so we will not be shifting to a fully consumption-based model. It will basically be -- and this is all -- please take -- this is all still work in process here. But it is likely that we would be shifting to a model where we're maintaining the subscription relationship and sort of a base level of subscription with consumption-based pricing -- consumption-based charging on top of that. And so you're right that in the ASV construct  there will not be an ability to predict the exact levels of the incremental consumption on top of the base level subscription. And that's something that  as we move into that space  we'll all get comfortable with that together. On the 250 clients  so we have gone through -- as I mentioned in my remarks  we've gone through a process of training our full sales force  and this is not a light endeavor in terms of our overall sales and account management team. That's about 2 700 people  so a very substantial part of the organization  in terms of thinking in this way  in terms of focusing on our customers in this way and in terms of allocating the resources appropriately. And this includes the focus on the 250 accounts  but also  as I mentioned  the focus on the shift of the 10 000 smaller tail accounts to basically call center hubs  and we're still in that process. So we're not completely done on either part of that. In terms of the spending  I don't know if there's nothing specific I would add on  but if Anna wants to touch on...Anna Manz: A couple of thoughts. If you think about it  historically  we've been serving 40 000 customers with humans  which has to be a deeply inefficient way of doing it. And so what you're seeing us do here is really make sure that we're targeting our resource  those really biggest customers that can drive the incremental value and removing the sales force focus from those ones that can and would actually prefer to engage with us electronically. So this is not about incremental spend in sales. It's actually about efficiency  but it's about efficiency  greater returns focus and  frankly  a better experience for our customer.David Schwimmer: Then on your last question with respect to trials with new customers  so we have had our design partners actively engaged in the product build process and the development. And then in terms of  to use your word  trials  we will have pilot versions of these products with a subset of members of the design partnership around kind of end of March  April time frame. That applies to Meeting Prep. We are also going to be piloting Open Directory with probably one close partner on the same time frame  and then we'll be rolling that out further over the course of the year.Peregrine Riviere: Arnaud?Arnaud Giblat: Good morning. It's Arnaud Giblat from BNP Paribas (OTC: ) Exane. Three questions  please. Firstly  could we come back on the adoption of Workspace? I think from the stats you gave on the time your clients have taken on Workspace  it sounded like usage have increased by about 20%  25%. Could you confirm that or give a more -- the accurate number? My second question is  you talked about sunsetting Eikon in 2025. I mean  given that Eikon is run on-premise and Workspace on the cloud  I'm just wondering if there are any significant cost synergies to extract from that event. And thirdly  really interesting  the Meeting Prep demo you showed us. I think one of the big advantages is the AI being able to access the client's data. I'm just wondering if -- particularly knowing how banks work  if you're finding any pushback in terms of giving access -- giving AI access to clients' data  how difficult is it to convince -- what sort of safeguards need to be put in place  so that the clients adopt it?David Schwimmer: I'll take the first and third  if you want to touch on the cost question. So maybe a little bit of a correction or adjustment in terms of your first question around usage. So we have a customer experience monitor  which is an ongoing process in terms of tracking our customers and their customer satisfaction scores  their usage. What we have found is that usage when you are a Workspace user  that your Workspace is your -- is the desktop that you use 59% of the time. This is for multiple desktop users  so if a customer has other services. That compares to  if you were an Eikon user before Workspace  if I have the percentage  was 43%  yes  you used Eikon 43% of the time. So that's a significant uptick in terms of where our customers who have access to multiple desktops and have a choice where they are spending their time. That's probably not -- what that does imply is greater usage. But I just want to be careful  it's not exactly the same thing as what you said in terms of usage increasing by 25% or so. But that is a very clear and strong indicator  and we have other customer metrics that are comparable to that in terms of -- our customers like Workspace. It's a great product. Just -- while I'm going here  I'll then turn it over to you. Pushback from customers on data  Microsoft is perceived to be a very good enterprise partner. And if you think about how embedded Microsoft already is in many of these institutions  we use them. I'm sure many of you use them. It is a question  but it is a question that is addressed. And I'll say  I'm a pilot user of Copilot now. And so I am now using some of these tools that have access to all of my files. And I would say initially  it's -- you asked questions  like  who else has access to because I actually asked that question. And for the files that are just in my OneDrive  I'm the only person who has access to them. If you put them into SharePoint  anybody has access to them. So it certainly raised the question in my mind. I'm sure it raises the question for our customers. But once you address those questions  the power of the product is impressive. Just quickly to Anna on...Anna Manz: Yes. So sunsetting Eikon and does it give us a big synergy benefit. So as I've said before  there's quite a big opportunity for us to continue to drive efficiency actually across our whole platform  as we continue to modernize our infrastructure and improve the quality of the applications across the top and move to the cloud. And that's why there is a sustained cost opportunity to create cost efficiencies to allow further investment beyond the Refinitiv synergies  and sunsetting Eikon is part of that. I wouldn't see it as a single big lump in and of itself. Actually  there's lots of small applications that sit around it  and we sunset them sort of one by one over time. So what you'll see is consistent cost efficiency as we've delivered through the synergies to date  but coming through other moves to make our platform more scalable  and it's part of that.Peregrine Riviere: Hubert?Hubert Lam: Thanks. It's Hubert Lam from Bank of America. I've got 3 questions. Firstly  on EBITDA margin. I know your target is to have that growing over time. But any guidance for this year and the moving parts  like how much more of a hit is EBITDA margin could be from the Microsoft investments and other moving parts? That's the first question. Second question is on capital allocation. Just wondering what your thoughts are in terms of further possibility of M&A for this year. I know you've got your management time mainly around Microsoft. But just wondering what other opportunities potentially to see or maybe even another buyback by the year-end. And lastly  on the -- another regulation question on EU derivatives. I'm just wondering what your thoughts are on that. It seems to not be that significant for you  but just wondering what your thoughts on it after the EU proposal. Thank you.David Schwimmer: Thank you. Do you want to take the first question? I'll take the other 2.Anna Manz: It's going to be a bit of a nonanswer  I'm afraid. EBITDA margin will improve in 2024 is what we've said. The moving parts to think about  you've got the annualization of some of the Refinitiv synergies that we've seen. You've got some more to come through  and we will be making investment. You'll see the Microsoft investment ramp up a little bit. And there'll be some areas of investment. But overall  it will give us margin enhancement.David Schwimmer: And on capital allocation  Anna had a slide on this in the presentation. You should expect to see us continue to manage our capital in a very similar way. So this is a business that generates a lot of cash flow  and we are continuing to invest in the business. You shouldn't be surprised to see us do the more modest sized kind of bolt-on M&A going forward. We've done a number of those over the past couple of years  and they've all been very additive to us strategically and financially. I think we've talked about the buyback we announced today. I think that is probably a good place to start for this year. But that gives you a sense. We will continue to actively manage our capital going forward. And then on EU clearing  this has been a topic that we've talked about a lot over the last 6  7 years. And I think you're absolutely right. So it looks as if the EU regulators have come out with a proposal and a new regime that I think is being described as pragmatic from a risk management perspective  this notion of having active accounts for various market participants. But in terms of impact on our business  I'll say  de minimis kind of impact  and you've seen our business continuing to grow very attractively. And I think it ends up being a healthy outcome for the markets  including our members who are based in the EU  who want to have access to our liquidity in LCH.Peregrine Riviere: Ian?Ian White: Thanks. This is Ian White from Autonomous Research. A couple of follow-ups from my side  please. Just -- first of all  is there any particular reason you might offer as to why maybe you haven't been seeing the sales cycle pressures that some of your North American peers have called out over the last few months? That's question one. And just on question 2  I'm keen to understand a bit more or a slightly bit more detail about the progress on the Workspace migration following on from the numbers you put up on Slide 27. I guess  where is Eikon continuing to provide mission-critical functionality for clients? And what operationally kind of still needs to happen from your side in order for that functionality to transfer to Workspace and those users to transfer to? Thank you.David Schwimmer: Sure. So on your first question  I can't comment on the North American peers and the challenges that they might be facing. But what I can say very clearly is our business is significantly more diversified than those you are talking about. And we serve our customers in a much broader way than most of our peers. We don't have a particular focus or particular exposure  for example  to buy side or a particular exposure to a segment  like wealth. A relatively small percentage of our business is charged on a per user or per desktop basis. So you put all of those things together and the diversity of our business  we -- as I said  we're not seeing those kinds of dynamics that some of our U.S. competitors or peers have spoken about. In terms of the migration of Workspace  so there are a couple of things here. Overall  I would say the big picture answer is that this is just about working with our customers. And we need to work with them on their time frames to make sure that these migrations go smoothly. There are a couple aspects of if a customer has been using Eikon for many  many years. They may have certain tailored or bespoke aspects associated with it. And so in certain cases like that  we may be working to make sure that when the migration happens  it's relatively seamless  so that they can access some of the same bespoke functionality on Workspace. So in certain cases  that is an element of what we are working through. But broadly speaking  it's about working on customer time lines and on their time frame.Ian White: Got it. Thanks.Peregrine Riviere: Ben?Benjamin Bathurst: Hi. It's Ben Bathurst from RBC. I've got a question on Microsoft. At the CMD  I think it was apparent that there could be opportunities to expand the existing partnership. I just wondered  firstly  if you'd agree with that. And then secondly  over what sort of time horizon do you think those conversations might be starting to happen?David Schwimmer: I guess  the way I would answer that  I'm not sure I would describe it as anything unusual in terms of expanding the partnership. I would just say the partnership is evolving  and a lot has changed over the last year plus. And we and Microsoft are working very well together. When we announced the partnership  generative AI was -- had just been announced. ChatGPT had just been launched 2 weeks before we announced the partnership. Microsoft Fabric had not been announced yet. That's a platform that we're working very actively with. And so some of the products that we're talking about now in terms of Meeting Prep  those were not fully formed 1.5 years ago. So I think the point that you probably heard some of this from Satvinder at the Capital Markets Day  there's a lot that we are doing together. And as we -- as the market is evolving  as the technology is evolving  as we're learning more and more about each other  we are seeing how we can do more and more together. It's proving to be  I would say  a very healthy successful partnership  and we look forward to continuing to build on it as we go forward.Peregrine Riviere: Mike? Sorry.Michael Werner: Thank you. Mike Werner from UBS. Two questions  please. In terms of the rollout of the Microsoft enhancements  it's taken some time to fully roll out Workspace. As you say  it's going to be done by the end of this year. How long will that roll out and some of these new products take? Is this something that takes us into the middle of '25? I'm just trying to get an idea there. And then second  I think in the past  you've noted how there's a -- quite a big disparity between your desktop product  the Workspace product  and some competitors. As these new functionalities and capabilities and the strength of this product becomes evident to the market  when you think about pricing in terms of narrowing that gap  is that something you expect to do incrementally over time? Or do you expect over a year or 2 where you kind of narrow that gap a little bit more quickly? Thank you.David Schwimmer: Actually  I think your 2 questions are pretty closely related. And what I mean by that is the fact that we will be rolling out new capabilities and new products and new functions kind of incrementally. So if you go back to probably the product launch of Eikon  I don't know  15  20 years ago  there was a big launch. We don't expect to have a big launch of a completely new system or a completely new platform. You're going to start to see really high-quality products rolling out incrementally  and Meeting Prep is a great example of this. It's coming in  in a few months  and that will have a big impact on our customers. But it's not going to be a massive launch. It's going to be a new button on the screen. I think you'll see more of that. Open Directory  similarly  this will enable Teams users to communicate across different companies. Today  Teams is only an intracompany platform. And I think we can all see how powerful it would be to have that kind of communication flexibility across the industry. But again  there will be a launch of that functionality  but it will not be a massive new launch of Workspace. So you'll see more and more of that. And then if you go to your second question in terms of what does the pricing look like  I think that as we add more value and as we make this platform more and more powerful and better and better for our customers  you'll see the pricing adjust appropriately.Peregrine Riviere: Oliver?Oliver Carruthers: Hi  there. Oliver Carruthers from Goldman Sachs. Maybe just one final one for me. Assuming this Design Partner Programme with Microsoft and your strategic customers feels like an environment that you can drive innovation in a fairly derisked way because you're figuring out what your customers want and you're piloting it with them as you go. When you have these top-to-top dialogues  what is your sense of what your competitors are doing or potentially will do in terms of building out these new solutions like this Meeting Prep product for your customers?David Schwimmer: Hard for us to speculate on that. I think we can only assume that our customers -- that our competitors will try to respond. And of course  everyone across the industry is putting out announcements about how much they're doing with AI. And you all can evaluate those as they come. But I think we feel very good about our positioning. We are viewed culturally  and if I can use that word  as a partner to the industry. The partnership with Microsoft is working very well. Microsoft is viewed as a good enterprise partner for the industry. So that is a very strong triangle  if I can put it that way  in terms of our sense -- as our position as a very strong partner systemic to the industry  Microsoft's position as a very strong partner. And we can't control what our competition is going to do  but we like our position  like our chances. And the receptivity from the customer base is  I'll say  very encouraging.Oliver Carruthers: Thanks.Peregrine Riviere: Great. I think that’s it in the room. So operator  could you open the lines for Q&A from the conference call  please?Operator: [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of Kyle Voigt from KBW. Your line is open.Kyle Voigt: Hi. Good morning. Maybe just a few follow-ups for Anna on expenses. First  on Slide 14  you showed the walk and impact to your EBITDA margins with margins  excluding the impact of FX  coming in at 47.7%  which is very slightly below the 48% guide. But that is despite over delivering your cost synergy target in the year and with organic revenue growth coming in stronger than you initially guided to. So I'm just wondering on a core basis  where did the incremental expense growth come from in 2023 versus your initial expectations? Was there simply a higher level of investments paid for growth during the year? Or was the core operating expense inflation a bit higher than expected? And then my second question  on Slide 13  expense growth walk  you show 4.6% growth in core and 4% growth for investments in 2023. It sounds like there will still be some increase related to Microsoft spend in 2024. But is it fair to think that investments for growth bucket will significantly decelerate in 2024 given that we've already had the big step-up in 2023 related to Microsoft? And can you remind us where you stand today on the £250 million to £300 million of incremental cash costs you expected when you laid out that Microsoft deal? Thank you.Anna Manz: So if I start with your first question  which I think if I boil it right down  it's really what has changed during the year  have you seen incremental inflation or is it phasing. And I would say the thing that has changed during the year is really the phasing of efficiencies and investments. And we don't go into the year with that completely fixed because we invest when we're ready to invest well and deliver well  deliver those returns. And we ramp up at the speed we're confident that the teams are ready and delivering. And the same with efficiencies  we work our way through it  so that the change that we're implementing doesn't impact the business as a whole. So you do see phasing move around a little bit in the year. With respect to your question around Microsoft costs year-on-year and also what that means for the level of investment in 2024  I'm not going to answer it directly  but I can give you a bit of a sense. So the step-up in 2023  some of that was Microsoft  but actually not a huge piece of it was in that we were ramping up our Microsoft investment back to that. We do it thoughtfully. Some of it was in other areas because  as you can see  we're investing to transform our sales force  for example. So I wouldn't sort of read that straight as a Microsoft thing. Year-on-year  we'll spend a little bit more on Microsoft. In terms of investments and efficiencies  we will be making some more investments to drive growth. You see the benefit that's having on the top line  but you also see the work that we're doing on efficiencies. So across the two  you can be comfortable that we'll see margin enhancement year-on-year.Peregrine Riviere: Thanks  Kyle. Next question.Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Johannes Thormann from HSBC. Your line is open.Johannes Thormann: Hello  everybody. Johannes Thormann. Two follow-up questions  please. First of all  on your pricing policy regarding the mix of consumption and subscription-based models  will the clients have a choice in choosing how much subscription and how much consumption they want? Or will you put in pillars where everybody has to take a certain level of subscription and a certain level of consumption-based pricing? And secondly  looking at your strong rise in OTC revenues  if we look at previous years  has there been any incremental shift like in the mix from SwapClear and other clearing products? Or have both buckets  I may say so  SwapClear and the other clearing products like CSP  and so increased similarly in the last year? Thank you.David Schwimmer: Thanks  Johannes. So on the pricing question  probably the best way to answer that is to say early days. I think we have a good track record over many years of partnering with our customers in a way  demonstrating flexibility to our customers to make sure that what we're doing works from their perspective. So it's probably premature for me to give you a detailed framework of exactly what that's going to look like. But I think the subscription revenue model will certainly continue  and this -- we will not be inventing this. There are plenty of other industries that have seen these kinds of models. So we'll keep you posted as this comes closer to delivery. Do you want to touch on the breakdown in terms of the OTC revenues?Anna Manz: Yes. So our cleared business is  of course  by far the majority of our OTC line  and that is what is driving the majority of that. But within that  you've also got some really good momentum in the pieces that we're building to create Post Trade Solutions. And while it's off a smaller base and early stage  really good momentum and strong growth there  and that's building for the future. And of course  there's some acquisition benefit in the year as well.Peregrine Riviere: Okay. Thanks  Johannes.Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Benjamin Goy from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.Benjamin Goy: Yes. Hi. Good morning. Two questions  please. First  given we are now 2 months into the first quarter  maybe you can comment a bit on the ASV trends going into 2024  considering Q4 -- or Q1 was a strong year with the pricing. So what's the pricing impact we can expect this year and then Credit Suisse and other moving parts maybe? And the second is now 3 years after the Refinitiv deal closed  are restructuring challenges  integration challenges falling going forward? And how do you think about moving to a reported -- reporting structure EBITDA  operating profit other than adjusting for purchase price amortization  which I think is fair? Thank you.Anna Manz: So shall I take those? So with respect to ASV  so we ended the year at 6.7%. We've said to you before that we expect to see the similarly higher level of pricing increase in 2024 that we saw in 2023  and that's really on the back of all of the improvements that we've made in our products and the improvement in customer satisfaction. And we've said to you that there will be an impact in the first half of Credit Suisse that would be bigger than the impact that we've seen so far. I guess  stepping back from it  I would point you back to the strong sales metrics that we're seeing  I think  which gives me comfort going into the year. And the second question was  sorry?David Schwimmer: Structuring integration  all that's mostly...Anna Manz: Yes. Refinitiv synergies. So as we move to the end of our Refinitiv synergy costs -- our Refinitiv cost synergies  the cost associated with the delivery of those synergies will start to tail off. There is still more to do on the Refinitiv revenue synergies  and you will see that cost associated with delivering those revenue synergies continue as we move from the £158 million run rate that we are at today to -- into the £350 million to £400 million zone. So a bit more to go  but  I mean  really more than broken the back of it  and the machine is working well.Operator: [Operator Instructions] And there are no final questions. I would like to hand the call back over to David Schwimmer  Chief Executive Officer.David Schwimmer: Thank you. Before we wrap up  I would just like to recognize Anna's huge contribution to LSEG over the last 3 years. She has been a great partner to me  to the Executive Committee  to the Board. And she has combined a strong sense of strategic direction  high standards  rigorous attention to detail. We are sorry to see her go. But if I could pick out two among the many areas of contribution just to highlight  Anna played a critical role in driving the Microsoft partnership over the line. And of course  she has played a critical role in driving a lot of the integration  financial and otherwise around Refinitiv. She's had a great impact throughout the organization culturally as a role model  great impact on her team. We all wish you the best. We will be watching your successes at Nestle. And thank you  and congratulations.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

To mark the …The post De Gruyter Brill Begins He…,De Gruyter and Brill have formed De Gruyter BrillBerlin and Leiden  March 4  2024 – De Gruyter and Brill have joined forces to form De Gruyter Brill  a leading academic publisher in the humanities and beyond. To mark the occasion  a new corporate website has been launched today at degruyterbrill.com.With combined pro forma revenues of approximately €140 million and 750 employees  De Gruyter Brill is uniquely positioned to offer outstanding services and technological infrastructure tailored to the needs of academic authors  librarians  and institutions around the world. Together  De Gruyter Brill publishes well over 3 500 books and 800 journals per year  with a particularly strong focus on the humanities and social sciences  while extending to subject areas in science  technology  engineering  and mathematics.The increased scale not only enables De Gruyter Brill to offer a highly attractive and diverse publishing environment for its authors’ publications across disciplines. It also allows the publisher to accelerate the transition to open access and fund technology investments for the benefit of the scholarly community. Joining forces also makes the business more resilient  allowing more effective sales and marketing operations and increasing the ability to attract and retain talent.The new name De Gruyter Brill signals the importance of the long heritage of both publishers. The existing individual De Gruyter and Brill brands  as well as their respective imprints and publishing programs  will continue. De Gruyter Brill intends to build on the size  breadth  and depth of the existing publishing programs  offering authors as many opportunities to publish under established De Gruyter Brill imprints  in existing series and journals  and in as many subject areas as before.As scholarly publishing continues to digitize and move toward open access  operational scale has become an increasingly important factor in remaining competitive  funding future investments  and achieving efficiencies. The strategic rationale is underpinned by shared cultural values. De Gruyter and Brill are deeply rooted in the scholarly community  building on a long tradition of trusted partnerships with academic institutions  serving authors  and publishing research of the highest quality.“The creation of De Gruyter Brill is an exciting new chapter in the centuries-long history of our two publishing houses ” said Carsten Buhr  Chief Executive Officer of De Gruyter Brill. “I firmly believe that as De Gruyter Brill we will be in an even better position to shape the future of scholarly communication as a trusted partner to the academic community. I look forward to working with our new and existing colleagues to ensure that rigorous scholarly research continues to have a significant impact on the world.”“As De Gruyter Brill  we will be able to provide better services  technology  and infrastructure to our authors and the academic community at large. In addition  we will accelerate our transition towards open access. The research we publish is crucial in answering today’s global questions and  as the leading publisher in the humanities  we will be able to increase its impact ” said Jasmin Lange  Chief Publishing Officer  De Gruyter Brill.“With the creation of De Gruyter Brill we are bringing Brill back into family ownership. Our independence will allow De Gruyter Brill to prioritize long-term investment and economic sustainability. We are committed to ensuring that De Gruyter Brill remains a family-owned  independent publishing house for many more centuries to come ” said Rüdiger Gebauer  Chairman of the Supervisory Board of De Gruyter Brill.With the closing of the transaction  Brill’s delisting from Euronext will come into effect on 28 March 2024.De Gruyter BrillMauricio QuiñonesCommunicationsTel: +49 30 260 05 424mauricio.quinones@degruyterbrill.com,neutral,0.07,0.92,0.01,positive,0.64,0.34,0.02,True,English,"['De Gruyter Brill', 'family-owned, independent publishing house', 'Mauricio Quiñones Communications', 'existing individual De Gruyter', 'De Gruyter Brill imprints', 'pro forma revenues', 'Chief Executive Officer', 'Rüdiger Gebauer', 'diverse publishing environment', 'two publishing houses', 'Chief Publishing Officer', 'new corporate website', 'exciting new chapter', 'existing publishing programs', 'many subject areas', 'rigorous scholarly research', 'leading academic publisher', 'scholarly publishing', 'respective imprints', 'existing series', 'existing colleagues', 'Brill brands', 'leading publisher', 'new name', 'scholarly community', 'scholarly communication', 'academic community', 'strong focus', 'social sciences', 'open access', 'effective sales', 'marketing operations', 'long heritage', 'many opportunities', 'important factor', 'competitive, funding', 'strategic rationale', 'cultural values', 'long tradition', 'trusted partnerships', 'highest quality', 'centuries-long history', 'Carsten Buhr', 'global questions', 'Jasmin Lange', 'family ownership', 'long-term investment', 'economic sustainability', 'Supervisory Board', 'academic institutions', 'academic authors', 'outstanding services', 'technological infrastructure', 'operational scale', 'future investments', 'significant impact', 'authors’ publications', 'technology investments', 'Berlin', 'Leiden', 'forces', 'humanities', 'occasion', 'degruyterbrill', 'million', '750 employees', 'needs', 'librarians', 'world', '3,500 books', '800 journals', 'year', 'engineering', 'mathematics', 'attractive', 'disciplines', 'transition', 'benefit', 'business', 'talent', 'importance', 'publishers', 'size', 'breadth', 'depth', 'efficiencies', 'creation', 'position', 'addition', 'independence', 'Chairman', 'closing', 'transaction', 'delisting', 'Euronext', '28 March', 'Tel', 'quinones']",2024-03-04,2024-03-05,sspnet.org
