The US and UK have been pushing for action to seize the holdings and use them to fund the Ukrainian government.The West has frozen roughly $300 billion in assets belonging to the Russian central bank since the start of the Ukraine conflict.During a joint press conference with Czech President Petr Pavel in Prague on Tuesday  Macron outlined his support for the European Commission’s proposal to tax profits generated from the reinvestment of the funds  suggesting that the move could potentially unlock €3-5 billion ($3.25-5.4 billion) annually to bolster Ukraine’s defense capabilities. He emphasized however that the core assets should remain untouched.“We are not in favor of doing things forbidden in international law and opening a debate that I believe would weaken Europe ” Macron stated.Western allies have been divided over the issue of confiscating the frozen billions to help Ukraine  and continue to debate legal ways to use the immobilized funds. US President Joe Biden has been pushing his fellow Group of Seven (G7) leaders to make progress on a plan to use the frozen assets to fund Kiev by the time they meet in June  according to media reports. US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen insisted recently that the legal and moral foundations for confiscation were strong.The EU  however  has been cautious about the legal and financial implications of such a move. Most of Russia’s assets are located in the EU  primarily at the Belgium-based clearing house Euroclear. Taking action without legal justification could reflect badly on the Western financial system and do harm to the bloc’s reputation  leading members have warned.Moscow has condemned the freezing of its national wealth as illegal  and has stated that any confiscation of the money would be criminal.

Brussels-based clearing house Euroclear holds around €191 billion ($205 billion) of them and has accrued nearly €4.4 billion in interest over the past year.While the US and UK have been pushing for actions to outright seize the funds  the EU has warned about the legal and financial implications of such a move and has opted instead for a plan to seize the interest earned from the funds.Moscow has warned that it will respond in kind if the West goes through with threats to confiscate Russian assets blocked abroad. Finance Minister Anton Siluanov noted last month that Western states themselves still have holdings in Russia that could be jeopardized if the frozen funds are tapped.The EU  along with the US  has been providing military aid to Ukraine  with individual countries such as Germany and Spain sending tanks and weapons  and the bloc providing artillery shells.EU countries should do whatever it takes to provide Ukraine with the ammunition it needs  Borrell said last month  after Kiev’s counter-offensive stalled and the Russian military continued its advance against Ukrainian forces in Donbass  including the liberation of the key town of Avdeevka.,neutral,0.06,0.53,0.42,negative,0.04,0.34,0.63,True,English,"['frozen Russian assets', 'EU mulls', 'military support', 'Ukraine', 'Borrel', 'Finance Minister Anton Siluanov', 'The European Peace Facility', 'foreign policy chief', 'Brussels-based clearing house', 'Russian central bank', 'The West', 'Russian military', 'past year', 'military support', 'late January', 'news conference', 'military capacity', 'technology base', 'potential use', 'separate statement', 'budget mechanism', 'financial implications', 'Western states', 'military aid', 'individual countries', 'artillery shells', 'Ukrainian forces', 'key town', 'Russian assets', 'windfall profits', 'Russian funds', 'EU nations', 'EU members', 'EU countries', 'frozen funds', 'Josep Borrell', 'Ukraine conflict', 'Moscow', 'interest', 'option', 'reconstruction', 'bloc', 'billions', 'euros', 'destruction', 'country', 'Tuesday', 'TASS', 'defense', 'deliveries', 'procurement', 'step', 'Twitter', 'weapons', 'holdings', 'start', 'Euroclear', 'actions', 'legal', 'move', 'plan', 'kind', 'threats', 'Germany', 'Spain', 'tanks', 'ammunition', 'Kiev', 'advance', 'Donbass', 'liberation', 'Avdeevka']",2024-03-05,2024-03-06,rt.com

Washington policymakers are piling pressure on their allies to ditch their hang-ups over what would be an unprecedented step fraught with legal  ethical and political difficulties.“It’s never been done before to seize a country’s reserves ” said Charles Lichfield  an analyst with the Atlantic Council and a leading expert on Russian frozen assets. “But crossing the threshold  the irreversible threshold  where you take them away and give them to Ukraine  while morally it may seem right … the Europeans are not yet comfortable with doing it without a more sound legal basis  which has not yet been found.”Washington's determination has alarmed European governments that worry such a move would spook investors in the euro. Others fear Moscow could retaliate by targeting European assets in Russia and launching cyberattacks against Western countries. Some say that however heinous Moscow’s behavior  a country shouldn’t be forced into reparations while war still rages.The problem for the U.S. is that the vast majority of the assets are kept in Belgium  in the security depository Euroclear ― America holds only negligible amounts ― so any confiscation move would need European approval. The hope is that the G7 group of leading industrialized nations will come up with a common position later this year.EU doesn't plan full-scale confiscationA senior Biden administration official  having been granted anonymity to discuss the sensitive issue  confirmed to POLITICO there are tensions between the U.S. and some of its European allies over the matter.The European Commission  the EU's executive arm  is not ready to go beyond an existing plan that only targets the revenues generated by the frozen funds  rather than a wholesale confiscation of the assets.,neutral,0.04,0.76,0.2,mixed,0.08,0.25,0.67,True,English,"['Western allies', 'Putin', 'U.S. President Joe Biden', 'senior Biden administration official', 'unprecedented step fraught', 'sound legal basis', 'leading industrialized nations', 'The European Commission', 'Russian frozen assets', 'legal, ethical', 'leading expert', 'frozen funds', 'European governments', 'European approval', 'powerful governments', 'political difficulties', 'Charles Lichfield', 'Atlantic Council', 'Western countries', 'vast majority', 'security depository', 'negligible amounts', 'G7 group', 'common position', 'sensitive issue', 'executive arm', 'European assets', 'European allies', 'full-scale confiscation', 'wholesale confiscation', 'Washington policymakers', 'irreversible threshold', 'existing plan', 'Paris', 'Berlin', 'Rome', 'pressure', 'hang-ups', 'country', 'reserves', 'analyst', 'Ukraine', 'Europeans', 'determination', 'move', 'investors', 'Others', 'Moscow', 'cyberattacks', 'behavior', 'reparations', 'war', 'problem', 'Belgium', 'America', 'hope', 'anonymity', 'POLITICO', 'tensions', 'matter', 'revenues']",2024-03-05,2024-03-06,politico.eu

That's close to  but still below Tuesday's highs.Bitcoin briefly topped $69K on Tuesday  setting a new all-time high  but has since corrected by more than 15%.The size  speed and nature of the decline indicate a desire for ""weak hands"" to exit Bitcoin. At its lowest point  the price fell below $59K due to large orders that the market was unable to quickly digest. Excluding this spike  we can assume that the price fell to $62K - last week's consolidation area - wiping out all the recent gains.We saw these 15% corrections for a long time after the first update of the highs in the last cycle in 2020.

The data provide further evidence of the efficacy of NCX 470  and its robust intraocular pressure lowering effect  reinforcing the positive results we have seen in the first Phase 3 trial  Mont Blanc. We are looking forward to continuing to progress NCX 470 in the second Phase 3 trial  Denali  and moving this innovative product towards market ” said Doug Hubatsch  Chief Scientific Officer of Nicox.Details of the presentations are as follows:Poster title: Intraocular Pressure Reduction with NCX 470 versus Latanoprost Across the Spectrum of Baseline Intraocular PressuresAn analysis of Intraocular pressure (IOP) reduction by baseline IOPs demonstrated that in patients with baseline pressures ≤ 28 mmHg  NCX 470 was numerically better at all  and statistical superior at 5/6 timepoints at lowering IOP vs. latanoprost  the current standard of care. Furthermore  NCX 470 provided consistent IOP reduction across the spectrum of baseline IOPs while latanoprost IOP reduction was baseline IOP-dependent.Poster title: Intraocular Pressure Reduction with NCX 470 versus Latanoprost In Previously Treated Versus Treatment-Naïve PatientsIn a pre-planned analysis  we tested whether being on previous IOP lowering medications had an impact on the IOP lowering of NCX 470. Previously treated subjects had greater IOP lowering vs. latanoprost at all timepoints but not by a clinically significant margin. Differences in IOP lowering between treatments were minimal in previously untreated patients. Whether previously treated or treatment naïve-should not impact the selection of NCX 470 versus latanoprost in the treatment of OAG or OHT.The posters are available on Nicox’s website in the section Publications.About NCX 470NCX 470  a novel NO-donating bimatoprost eye drop  is currently in Phase 3 clinical development for the lowering of IOP in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Results of Mont Blanc  the first of the two Phase 3 clinical trials  have been announced in October 2022. The second Phase 3 clinical trial  Denali  is currently ongoing  and the results are expected in 2025.About NicoxNicox SA is an international ophthalmology company developing innovative solutions to help maintain vision and improve ocular health.

The monetization process and Facility are further to Mithra’s 06 February 2024 announcement on its cash position.Monetization ProcessIn an effort to maximize value for all of Mithra’s stakeholders  the Company has initiated a monetization process to realize value from its assets involving the sale of various selected assets  particularly Estetra SRL  and/or the business as a whole (the ""Monetization Process""). The Company is finalizing negotiations with an internationally recognized investment bank to help conduct the Monetization Process in collaboration with DC Advisory and Alvarez & Marsal  who are advising on liquidity management and advising on monetization  among other things.As is described below  the Monetization Process with respect to key assets is being funded under the Facility  subject to achievement of milestones.Parties interested in participating in the Monetization Process should contact Ed Kulik of DC Advisory (Ed.Kulik@dcadvisory.com) and Thomas Dillenseger of Alvarez & Marsal (TDillenseger@alvarezandmarsal.com).Liquidity / Terms of FacilityThe Facility provides up to EUR 13.5 million to be drawn in multiple tranches upon the satisfaction of certain milestones  as well as an uncommitted EUR 5 million ""accordion"" facility (which can be used once the committed amount has been fully drawn and only if the lenders consent).The cash received under the Facility  if received in full  creates expected cash runway intended to fund the business through 30 April  permitting a focus on the Monetization Process.The borrower under the Facility is Estetra SRL with a guarantee from Mithra Pharmaceuticals SA (such guarantee being limited in recourse to the secured assets). The Facility is secured on all of the assets of Estetra SRL  a share pledge over shares in Estetra SRL and a pledge on intercompany receivables of Mithra Pharmaceuticals SA on Estetra SRL.The maturity date of the Facility is sixty days from the first utilization date of the Facility. The initial conditions precedent have been met  and the first drawdown of EUR 9 million is expected to be drawn on 6 March 2024.The remaining tranches can be drawn during successive periods of ten business days (starting within ten business days after signing) each time for an amount not exceeding EUR 2.5 million (and  for the avoidance of doubt  never exceeding in aggregate the total committed amount). Drawdowns under the remaining tranches are conditional upon additional milestones having been met  which primarily include various data and plans being provided to the Lenders in relation to the implementation of the Monetization Process  the appointment of (an) investment bank(s) to advise on the Monetization Process  the entry into an intercreditor agreement with other secured lenders  including receipt of third-party guarantor consent  and the actual implementation of the Monetization Process. The Facility is subject to mandatory prepayment in full upon a change of control over Estetra SRL and the proceeds of sales of assets of Estetra SRL will also be applied to a mandatory prepayment. The Facility contains various undertakings and events of default.The lenders under the Facility consist of funds managed by Highbridge Capital Management  LLC and funds managed by Whitebox Advisors  LLC (each a “Lender”). The Lenders under the Facility will enter into an intercreditor agreement with ING Belgium NV/SA and Belfius Bank NV/SA  the other existing secured creditors to Estetra SRL  who have agreed in principle to forebear and standstill with respect to any defaults under their agreements.The Facility does not bear interest; however  the Facility provides for a forbearance fee of 2% on the amounts outstanding under Mithra’s existing senior secured convertible facility with the Lenders (which is in consideration of the waivers and forbearance that the Lenders have provided to Mithra under that facility while Mithra explored strategic alternatives to maximize value for all of its stakeholders  as referenced in Mithra’s 6 February 2024 announcement on its cash position) and a 5% commitment fee on the committed amounts (including the accordion when and if it becomes committed). Both fees will be paid in kind by compounding these amounts with the principal amount of the Facility. The Facility also provides for an exit fee of 5% (or 10% in the absence of third party guarantor consent) of any amounts paid  repaid or cancelled under the Facility and a make-whole fee equal to the amount necessary to ensure that the total return on investment of the Lenders (including the funded amounts and compounded fees and interest  but excluding the commitment fee) is equal to 20% (or 30% in the absence of third party guarantor consent ) of the Facility. The exit fee and make-whole fee are payable in cash upon any repayment  prepayment or cancellation of the Facility.The EUR 12.8 million of cash currently held in escrow as described in the Mithra's 15 February announcement regarding the sale of its holding in Mayne Pharma is expected to be used to repay indebtedness owed to the Lenders under the existing facility.However  there is a risk that Mithra will not be able to draw the full amount  for instance if it is not able to initiate a Monetization Process. Even if a Monetization Process is initiated  there is a material risk that that process will not be successful  in whole or in part  or may not be sufficient to repay Mithra's existing indebtedness. If Mithra is not able to draw funds under the Facility or is otherwise not able to raise or generate sufficient cash  this will adversely affect Mithra's continued operations and ability to operate as a going concern.For more information  please contact:Mithra Pharmaceuticals SAAlex Sokolowski  PhDHead of IR & Communicationsinvestorrelations@mithra.com +32 (0)4 349 28 22Frédérique DepraetereCommunications Directorinfo@mithra.com+32 (0)4 349 28 22About MithraMithra Pharmaceuticals SA (Euronext: MITRA) is a Belgian biopharmaceutical company dedicated to transforming women’s health by offering new choices through innovation  with a particular focus on contraception and menopause.

The GEOVIA solutions portfolio is transforming significantly to seamlessly integrate with Dassault Systèmes' 3DEXPERIENCE platform. This integration establishes a unified source of truth  empowering organizations to strengthen their resilience in a swiftly evolving landscape while securing a competitive edge across the entire mining value chain  spanning from pit to port.The latest advancements in the GEOVIA portfolio include the Strategic Mine Planner role and the Underground Mine Designer role  which are available now.The GEOVIA Strategic Mine Planner role complements the Pit Optimizer role  allowing users to develop a comprehensive strategic plan that is robust and reliable by evaluating critical input parameters through multiple scenario analyses  from development to closure. It enables the simultaneous or sequential application of several advanced value-adding options for optimizing capacity to create a robust mining schedule that prioritizes value and ecological responsibility. The role counts with a novel optimization technology  based on an extension of the Bienstock-Zuckerberg algorithm  which provides increased net present value (NPV) while significantly speeding up runtimes compared to any other commercial solution.The GEOVIA Underground Mine Designer role enables the user to rethink the design experience of underground mining by evaluating multiple options thanks to generative parametric modeling. Users can generate and evaluate various development designs through a highly automated process  offering an optimal design assessment. Adopting a ""Safety by Design"" approach allows compliance with requirements and safety standards related to underground excavations  from physical constraints to geotechnical features. The new Underground Mine Designer role allows significant time-savings and transparency through seamless process and data model continuity between different mining levels  development areas and practical access designs.The two new roles complement the GEOVIA portfolio for mining in the 3DEXPERIENCE platform  which also includes Geology Modeler  Geoscience Referential Manager  Earth Engineering Coordinator and Pit Optimizer.“We are excited to actively participate at PDAC 2024 and announce our latest advancements in mining solutions ” said Mauro DelleMonache  CEO  GEOVIA  Dassault Systèmes. “Our team of mining specialists and consultants have prepared exciting live presentations featuring multiple releases and scheduled activities harnessing the capabilities of the 3DEXPERIENCE platform. GEOVIA solutions facilitate smooth collaboration  streamlined data exchange  and enhanced workflow efficiency  empowering mining companies to make well-informed decisions  elevate operational performance  and achieve operational and sustainability objectives. Our motivation stems from the vision of modeling a sustainable planet where technology  knowledge andknow-how play pivotal roles in advocating responsible management of natural resources. We look forward to connecting with our users  clients  and partners  sharing insights  and actively shaping the future of the mining segment together.”###FOR MORE INFORMATIONDassault Systèmes’ 3DEXPERIENCE platform  3D design software  3D Digital Mock Up and Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) solutions: http://www.3ds.comFor more information about Dassault Systèmes’ GEOVIA  visit https://www.3ds.com/products/geoviaSHARE THIS ON X  FORMERLY KNOWN AS TWITTER@Dassault3DS unveils innovative  collaborative @3dsGEOVIA mining solutions within the #3DEXPERIENCE platform @the_PDAC 2024Connect with Dassault Systèmes onhttps://twitter.com/Dassault3DShttps://www.facebook.com/DassaultSystemeshttps://www.linkedin.com/company/dassaultsystemeshttps://www.youtube.com/DassaultSystemesABOUT DASSAULT SYSTÈMESDassault Systèmes  the 3DEXPERIENCE® Company  is a catalyst for human progress.

In addition  the training campaign for all Group personnel in respect of the risks of conflicts of interest and corruption continued in 2023 as part of the Group's responsible systems and practices policy.Starting from January 1  2024  Ekinops has created the position of ""Corporate Sustainability Risks Manager""  to reconcile risks and sustainable development and to enable the company to better respond to ESG objectives.OutlookAgainst a backdrop of economic slowdown and rising interest rates affecting investment policies and financial health of companies  the Access activity was severely impacted in H2 2023. 2024 has started in the wake of end-2023  with the market now stabilized but not yet showing any signs of recovery.In view of demanding comparison (H1 2023 revenue up +12% to €71.0 million)  revenue in H1 2024 is likely to be down compared to last year.Further ahead  Ekinops expects Access equipment sales to rebound as the economy recovers  and plans to launch a major new optical transport product this summer  doubling the capacity of optical links  and a new OTN (Optical Transport Network) product  which should contribute to the healthy momentum of the Group's optical activity.In view of current visibility and a still uncertain timing for an economic recovery at this stage of the year  Ekinops does not provide financial guidance for 2024.In terms of acquisitions  Ekinops' management remains mobilized to carry out one or more operations to consolidate its R&D clout and round out its customer base  favoring non-dilutive financing.Full 2024 financial calendar can be found here.All press releases are published after Euronext Paris market close.EKINOPS ContactDidier Brédy -Chairman and CEO -

Site's heating will be delivered through electric heat pumps and lighting throughsmart LED devices with presence and luminance sensors. All this equipment helps drastically reduce the site's CO 2 emissions (divided by a factor of 10 compared with a standard warehouse). Remainingemissions will be compensated by a reforestation plan led in France. The site will thus be carbon neutral when operations start.Moreover  making a development on the military brownfield of Frescaty results in the recycling of land that has already been artificialized and thus limits the ecological impact of the whole project.The delivery of this first phase is expected for the 4th quarter of 2024. Additionally  an extension capacity of about 8 000 sq.m was arranged on this project's property-base.2024 financial calendar (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)March 21: General Assembly 2024April 2: Net sales of 1 st quarter 2024quarter 2024 July 1: Net sales of 2 nd quarter 2024quarter 2024 July 24: Half-year results 2024October 1: Net sales of 3rd quarter 20242025 financial calendar (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)January 3: Net sales of 4 th quarter 2024quarter 2024 January 16: Annual results 2024March 20: General Assembly 2025About ARGANARGAN is the only French real estate company specializing in the DEVELOPMENT & RENTAL OF PREMIUM WAREHOUSES listed on EURONEXT and is the leading player of its market.
