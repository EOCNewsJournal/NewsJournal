Keith Redmond (45) of Clearstream Court  McKee Avenue  Finglas pleaded guilty at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court to attempting  by electronic means  to disseminate sexually explicit material to a child between August 30 and December 3  2022.,A Dublin man has been jailed for sending explicit messages to someone he believed was a 14-year-old girl.Keith Redmond (45) of Clearstream Court  McKee Avenue  Finglas pleaded guilty at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court to attempting  by electronic means  to disseminate sexually explicit material to a child between August 30 and December 3  2022.Today's top videos STORY CONTINUES BELOWPassing sentence on Thursday  Judge Orla Crowe said this offending took place over a three-month period and described the charge as ‘inherently serious’.Keith Redmond (45) of Clearstream Court  McKee Avenue  Finglas pleaded guilty at Dublin Circuit Criminal Court to attempting  by electronic means  to disseminate sexually explicit material to a child between August 30 and December 3  2022. Photo: Collins CourtsJudge Crowe said that the aggravating factors before the court were that Redmond moved the conversation to a private platform when he was aware that the decoy was 14 years of age. There were 83 pages of sexually explicit conversation  and Redmond sent four pictures of his penis to the decoy.The judge said she would consider the following as mitigating factors in the case: his early guilty plea  his admissions  and he gave up his phone to the gardai. He has no previous convictions. He was a married father but has now lost his marriage and his job. In a letter written by Redmond  he outlines his shame and remorse.Judge Crowe said the threshold for a custodial sentence had been passed. She sentenced Redmond to two years in prison  with the final six months suspended for one year.She also placed him under the supervision of Probation Services for one-year post-release. She further ordered that Redmond have no unsupervised access to children.At a previous hearing  the court heard that the alarm was raised by a UK-based group called Volunteers for Predator Exposure.That group seeks out people who attempt to communicate with children by creating decoys and waiting to see if the decoy is contacted.Passing sentence on Thursday  Judge Orla Crowe said this offending took place over a three-month period and described the charge as ‘inherently serious’. Photo: Collins CourtsIn this case  the group created a decoy called ‘Amber’  a 14-year-old girl living in Leeds in the UK.The court heard that Redmond had put his details on a social media platform called Kick as ‘male  44  from Ireland’ and that the decoy  ‘Amber’  had connected with him.During her plea in mitigation  Anne Rowland SC  defending  told Judge Crowe that this case had caused her concern and should cause the court concern.She said her client had posted a profile on a widely used website that was not dedicated to porn or underage children  without seeking to contact anyone underage  and a message had come to him.She said her client had been approached by a UK-based person seeking out predators who are abusing or seeking to exploit underage girls. She said this was not the case with her client.Ms Rowland said this case could be distinguished from others before the court as her client did not set out to look for an underage girl  and there was no evidence that he did.She said the messaging was ‘not nice’ and had sexual content  but submitted he indicated to a Probation Officer that he was playing out a fantasy and there would never be a meeting.She said her client had not shown up for an arranged meeting and contact was again initiated by the decoy following two weeks of ‘radio silence’ from her client.She said there was something very objectionable about the methods of the organisation which set out to entrap her client. She said he had nothing of this nature on his mind and was ‘beguiled’ into it.Ms Rowland said she had a big concern this was bordering on entrapment and the court could take that into account in sentencing.She submitted that while her client feels ashamed and remorseful  there was not a ‘real person’ involved or being abused.She said a probation report before the court wrongly said he had initiated the contact but pointed out an assessment in the report places him at low risk of reoffending.Garda Tracey O’Reilly told Karl Moran BL  prosecuting  that within a few messages  Redmond asked ‘Amber’ what age she was and she replied that she was 14.Ms Rowland pointed out that Redmond then replied  ‘OK I’m a bit too old for you ’ whereupon the decoy replied  ‘it’s up to you ’ and Redmond answered  ‘add me so.’The court heard that Redmond then requested that the conversation move to the private messaging service WhatsApp.Redmond and the decoy proceeded to text one another over the following three months in a conversation that spanned 83 typed pages  the court heard.The chat initially comprised of ordinary conversation but then became sexually explicit.Redmond sent the decoy four photographs of his penis on dates in November 2022. He also sent selfies of his face and tattoos.The court heard there was a ‘grooming element’ in that Redmond discussed meeting ‘Amber’ for sexual activity  offered to buy her a phone and discussed running away to live together.They spoke about booking a hotel in Leeds and Redmond said he would have to act as her father and she would have to pretend to be his daughter.‘Your Mum would kill me if she knew I was texting you so this is our secret ’ one text read  while another told ‘Amber’ she was Redmond’s ‘sexy secret’.The accused said he had never done anything like this before and told ‘Amber’ she was ‘honest  beautiful and smart’.On one occasion  Redmond texted: ‘I don’t care that you’re 14  I like you lots.’The court heard that the UK-group used open source technology to locate the person making contact with their decoy and then got in touch with a similar Irish group called Child Online Protection Enforcers.Members of this group located Redmond on a laneway beside Boyle Sports on Manor Street in Dublin 7 and there were ‘angry scenes’ the court heard  before gardaí were called and Redmond asked for garda protection.Redmond gave his phone to gardaí and told them about the conversations on Kick and WhatsApp with ‘Amber’. He said they talked about ‘normal stuff’ at first but that it turned serious and they talked about what they would do to one another.‘After a while I sent a d**k pic  I don’t know why I did it  but I did ’ Redmond told gardaí.He has no previous convictions.Ms Rowland  told the court that members of the UK group Predator Exposure have been tried in the UK for false imprisonment in the last year.Counsel also pointed out that Kick is a social media platform and that Redmond told gardaí he had not gone on the site with any intention of making contact with a child.The court heard of a planned meeting between Redmond and ‘Amber’ in a Leeds hotel that never happened as Redmond did not book flights.The decoy sent him several messages on the day asking if he has come and that Redmond didn’t reply until he texted ‘sorry’ two weeks later and told ‘Amber’ that he got ‘cold feet’.Redmond was working as a barman and married with one child at the time of the offence  the court heard.Counsel said Redmond’s marriage had been breaking down for several years at the time of the offence and he was very unhappy.‘He embarks on this obsessive correspondence  it has all the hallmarks of a lonely person ’ Ms Rowland said.As a result of this prosecution Redmond has lost his job  left the family home and is now living with his parents in the city centre.Additional reporting by Fiona Ferguson.,negative,0.01,0.32,0.66,negative,0.01,0.27,0.71,True,English,"['explicit messages', '14-year-old girl', 'Man', 'someone', 'Garda Tracey O’Reilly', 'Dublin Circuit Criminal Court', 'A Dublin man', 'final six months', 'Karl Moran BL', 'following three months', 'social media platform', 'Anne Rowland SC', 'early guilty plea', 'Judge Orla Crowe', 'private messaging service', 'decoy four photographs', 'private platform', 'Judge Crowe', 'four pictures', 'Ms Rowland', '14-year-old girl', 'McKee Avenue', 'electronic means', 'explicit material', 'top videos', 'three-month period', 'Collins Courts', 'aggravating factors', 'mitigating factors', 'previous convictions', 'married father', 'one year', 'Probation Services', 'one-year post-release', 'unsupervised access', 'previous hearing', 'UK-based person', 'sexual content', 'Probation Officer', 'two weeks', 'radio silence', 'real person', 'low risk', 'grooming element', 'sexual activity', 'underage girls', 'big concern', 'Clearstream Court', 'explicit messages', 'two years', 'probation report', '83 typed pages', 'explicit conversation', 'ordinary conversation', 'custodial sentence', 'UK-based group', 'court concern', 'Keith Redmond', 'underage children', '14 years', '83 pages', 'someone', 'Finglas', 'August', 'December', 'STORY', 'Thursday', 'offending', 'place', 'charge', 'penis', 'case', 'admissions', 'phone', 'gardai', 'marriage', 'job', 'letter', 'shame', 'remorse', 'threshold', 'prison', 'supervision', 'alarm', 'people', 'decoys', 'Leeds', 'details', 'Ireland', 'mitigation', 'client', 'profile', 'website', 'porn', 'predators', 'others', 'evidence', 'fantasy', 'meeting', 'contact', 'something', 'methods', 'organisation', 'nature', 'mind', 'entrapment', 'account', 'sentencing', 'assessment', 'WhatsApp', 'chat', 'dates', 'November', 'selfies', 'face', 'tattoos', 'Amber', 'runnin']",2024-03-07,2024-03-07,extra.ie

Both refinancing transactions have been structured  arranged  and managed by ENCAVIS' inhouse Project Finance team.The Talayuela plant  located in the region of Extremadura  has a generation capacity of 300 MW  while the La Cabrera plant  located in the region of Andalusia  has a generation capacity of 200 MW. Both projects are operational since end of 2020/beginning of 2021 and were one of the first European utility scale solar parks that were realised and operated without public subsidies. The energy prices for the majority of the electricity production for both projects are fixed by long-term Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs)  both for a term of initially ten years.The refinancing is provided by a club of four international banks: ABN AMRO Bank N.V. (NL)  Coöperatieve Rabobank U.A. (NL)  Bankinter S.A. (ES)  as well as NatWest Bank Europe GmbH (GER/UK).

37035,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://digitalmarketreports.com/news/11297/deutsche-borse-unveils-institutional-spot-cryptocurrency-trading-service/,Deutsche Börse Unveils Institutional Spot Cryptocurrency Trading Service,The German securities marketplace  Deutsche Börse  has made a significant foray into the digital assets space with the introduction of its exclusive cryptocurrency trading platform  the Deutsche Börse Digital Exchange (DBDX)  specifically designed for ...,The German securities marketplace  Deutsche Börse  has made a significant foray into the digital assets space with the introduction of its exclusive cryptocurrency trading platform  the Deutsche Börse Digital Exchange (DBDX)  specifically designed for institutional clients. This strategic move  announced on March 5  marks a pivotal step in the company’s commitment to digital asset services  launched in partnership with Crypto Finance  a provider specializing in custody solutions.Innovating Cryptocurrency Trading for InstitutionsDBDX emerges as a regulated  secure ecosystem for the trading  settlement  and custody of cryptocurrency assets. Deutsche Börse emphasizes that the platform will initially adopt a request-for-quote (RfQ) model to facilitate trading. This approach allows businesses to solicit quotations directly from pre-selected suppliers and contractors  ensuring a tailored and competitive trading environment.Following the RfQ trading phase  DBDX is set to introduce a multilateral trading facility (MTF)  enhancing its trading system to accommodate financial instrument exchanges among various parties. This expansion demonstrates Deutsche Börse’s ambition to streamline and innovate institutional crypto trading practices.The platform’s services are poised to cater not only to clients within Germany but also to extend its reach across other European markets  reflecting a broader vision for continental digital asset trading infrastructure.A New Horizon for Digital Asset TradingCarlo Kölzer  Deutsche Börse’s Head of Digital Assets  articulated the transformative potential of the DBDX  positioning it as a cornerstone for trusted crypto asset market operations in Europe. The launch is aligned with Deutsche Börse’s Horizon 2026 strategy  aiming to lead in the digitalization of asset classes and establish a comprehensive suite of digital asset services.This initiative follows Deutsche Börse’s announcement in late 2023 about its plan to debut a digital asset platform. A crucial step towards the realization of DBDX was the acquisition of four licenses by Crypto Finance from the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) in February. These licenses authorized Crypto Finance to offer regulated digital asset trading  settlement  and custody services within Germany  setting a solid regulatory foundation for DBDX’s launch.Deepening Deutsche Börse’s Crypto EngagementDeutsche Börse’s venture into spot cryptocurrency trading reaffirms its proactive stance towards embracing digital assets. The firm has previously engaged with the cryptocurrency industry  notably through Xetra  its electronic trading platform. Xetra has listed a variety of cryptocurrency-related investment products  including exchange-traded products (ETPs) for Bitcoin and Ether by leading European issuers such as 21Shares.Moreover  Deutsche Börse has been exploring the utility of blockchain technology in enhancing operations  particularly in areas like securities financing. This ongoing exploration indicates the company’s broader interest in leveraging blockchain and crypto technologies to augment its traditional financial services.The launch of the Deutsche Börse Digital Exchange represents a strategic extension of Deutsche Börse’s digital assets and blockchain initiatives  targeting institutional clients with a robust  secure  and regulated platform for cryptocurrency trading. By integrating advanced trading models and setting a high standard for regulatory compliance  Deutsche Börse not only aims to cater to the immediate needs of institutional traders but also to shape the future landscape of digital asset trading in Europe. This development underscores the growing acceptance and integration of cryptocurrencies within traditional financial systems  promising enhanced liquidity  transparency  and efficiency for institutional participants in the digital asset market.Featured image credit: Timon via Adobe Stock,neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,neutral,0.07,0.92,0.01,True,English,"['Institutional Spot Cryptocurrency Trading Service', 'Deutsche Börse Unveils', 'German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority', 'continental digital asset trading infrastructure', 'Deutsche Börse Digital Exchange', 'The German securities marketplace', 'institutional crypto trading practices', 'crypto asset market operations', 'exclusive cryptocurrency trading platform', 'digital asset market', 'financial instrument exchanges', 'traditional financial systems', 'other European markets', 'Carlo Kölzer', 'leading European issuers', 'Featured image credit', 'competitive trading environment', 'multilateral trading facility', 'advanced trading models', 'traditional financial services', 'digital asset services', 'digital asset platform', 'regulated, secure ecosystem', 'A New Horizon', 'solid regulatory foundation', 'cryptocurrency-related investment products', 'Innovating Cryptocurrency Trading', 'RfQ trading phase', 'digital assets space', 'electronic trading platform', 'asset classes', 'securities financing', 'trading system', 'regulated platform', 'cryptocurrency assets', 'Crypto Finance', 'Crypto Engagement', 'crypto technologies', 'RfQ) model', 'Horizon 2026 strategy', 'cryptocurrency industry', 'exchange-traded products', 'regulatory compliance', 'institutional traders', 'institutional participants', 'institutional clients', 'custody services', 'significant foray', 'strategic move', 'pivotal step', 'various parties', 'broader vision', 'transformative potential', 'comprehensive suite', 'crucial step', 'proactive stance', 'ongoing exploration', 'broader interest', 'strategic extension', 'high standard', 'immediate needs', 'future landscape', 'growing acceptance', 'Adobe Stock', 'custody solutions', 'blockchain technology', 'blockchain initiatives', 'four licenses', 'introduction', 'DBDX', 'March', 'company', 'commitment', 'partnership', 'provider', 'Institutions', 'settlement', 'request', 'quote', 'approach', 'businesses', 'quotations', 'suppliers', 'contractors', 'tailored', 'MTF', 'expansion', 'ambition', 'Germany', 'reach', 'Head', 'cornerstone', 'launch', 'digitalization', 'announcement', 'plan', 'realization', 'acquisition', 'BaFin', 'February', 'venture', 'spot', 'firm', 'Xetra', 'variety', 'ETPs', 'Bitcoin', 'Ether', '21Shares', 'utility', 'areas', 'development', 'integration', 'cryptocurrencies', 'liquidity', 'transparency', 'efficiency', 'Timon']",2024-03-07,2024-03-07,digitalmarketreports.com

Four years later  ARGAN is now pursuing a new development in this area to deliver an Aut0nom®-labelled warehouse of 9 500 sq.m.Located on the outskirts of Metz  at the heart of an urban area of 240 000 inhabitants  with a direct connection to the A31 French highway  Augny offers an ideal location for the logistics businesses.This new Premium warehouse will be operated by 4MURS as part of a 12-year lease  including nine years for a fixed term.With 650 employees and a portfolio of 106 stores in France and Belgium  4MURS is reshaping its positioning by becoming a concept store that brings under one roof collections of various offerings for home decoration  for kids and lifestyle products.The site of Augny will be dedicated to managing the logistics flows for 7 000 SKUs sold by the company  close to its headquarters located in the neighbouring city of Marly.An exemplary site from an environmental standpointThis new warehouse will be Aut0nom®-labelled. With a rooftop photovoltaic power station combined with energy-storing batteries  this warehouse will generate its own green energy for its self-consumption. Site’s heating will be delivered through electric heat pumps and lighting throughsmart LED devices with presence and luminance sensors. All this equipment helps drastically reduce the site’s CO 2 emissions (divided by a factor of 10 compared with a standard warehouse). Remainingemissions will be compensated by a reforestation plan led in France. The site will thus be carbon neutral when operations start.Moreover  making a development on the military brownfield of Frescaty results in the recycling of land that has already been artificialized and thus limits the ecological impact of the whole project.The delivery of this first phase is expected for the 4th quarter of 2024. Additionally  an extension capacity of about 8 000 sq.m was arranged on this project’s property-base.2024 financial calendar (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)March 21: General Assembly 2024April 2: Net sales of 1 st quarter 2024quarter 2024 July 1: Net sales of 2 nd quarter 2024quarter 2024 July 24: Half-year results 2024October 1: Net sales of 3rd quarter 20242025 financial calendar (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)January 3: Net sales of 4 th quarter 2024quarter 2024 January 16: Annual results 2024March 20: General Assembly 2025About ARGANARGAN is the only French real estate company specializing in the DEVELOPMENT & RENTAL OF PREMIUM WAREHOUSES listed on EURONEXT and is the leading player of its market.

The study is planned to enroll up to 184 patients.“We are pleased to announce the dosing of a first patient in this Phase 1/2 study evaluating IPH6501  our proprietary ANKET® asset and the first tetraspecific NK Cell Engager to enter the clinic.” commentedDr Sonia Quaratino  Chief Medical Officer at Innate Pharma. “With the addition of the IL-2 variant  our second generation ANKET® molecules can deliver proliferation signals to NK cells  and thus enhance their effector functions against cancer cells. Thanks to this novel format  IPH6501 represents a promising alternative strategy to T cell therapies for patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas.”“The discovery and implementation of novel chemotherapies  T-cell based immunotherapies and targeted therapies have improved outcomes for patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas compared with traditional chemotherapy.” added Dr Lorenzo Falchi  Lymphoma Specialist at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center  New-York  and principal investigator of the study. “However  many patients fail to achieve a response to or develop disease relapse after treatment. In this context  IPH6501 represents an innovative option for the treatment of patients with R/R B-cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas and has the potential to fulfil a large unmet need.”More information about the trial can be found on clinicaltrials.gov.About B-Cell Non-Hodgkin’s LymphomaB-cell lymphomas are clonal tumors of mature and immature B cells that constitute the majority (80-85%) of NHLs. NHLs are a heterogeneous group of lymphoproliferative malignancies. NHL usually originates in the lymphoid tissues and can spread to other organs. NHL is the most common hematological malignancy worldwide  accounting for nearly 3% of cancer diagnoses and deaths.According to the latest World Health Organization (WHO) classification  the most common B-NHL in Western countries is Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL)  accounting for around 31% of adult cases. Other common aggressive B-cell subtypes include Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) (6% of cases) and Burkitt lymphoma (BL) (2% of cases). Among indolent B-cell NHL  Follicular Lymphoma (FL) accounts for 22% of cases in the Western world  followed by marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) (8% of cases).About IPH6501IPH6501 is the first Antibody-based NK cell Engager Therapeutic to co-engage activating receptors on NK cells (NKp46 and CD16)  IL-2R (but not α subunit) through a variant of human IL-2  and a tumor antigen (CD20) via a single molecule  hence providing proliferation and activation signals targeted to NK cells and promoting their cytotoxic activity against CD20 expressing malignant cells. IPH6501 has shown better anti-tumor efficacy than approved benchmark antibodies in preclinical tumor models (Demaria  EHA 2023).About ANKET®ANKET® (Antibody-based NK cell Engager Therapeutics) is Innate’s proprietary platform for developing next-generation  multispecific natural killer (NK) cell engagers to treat certain types of cancer. This fit-for-purpose technology is creating an entirely new class of molecules to induce synthetic immunity against cancer.About Innate PharmaInnate Pharma S.A. is a global  clinical-stage biotechnology company developing immunotherapies for cancer patients.

The planned investments will support the launch of more than 40 new products during the period as well as the development of new Bio-Hybrid technologies  innovative decarbonization technologies across the automotive supply chain  and strategic new business opportunities.The investment from Stellantis reinforces its leadership in the region  strengthens the development of the local industry  and accelerates its achievement of the Dare Forward 2030 long-term strategic plan as the region maintains its leadership in offering clean  safe and affordable mobility in Brazil and South America.“This announcement solidifies our trust and commitment in the future of the South American automotive industry and is a response to the favorable business environment here ” said Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares. “As a critical part of our ‘third engine’ growth strategy  South America will take a leading role in accelerating the decarbonization of mobility together with our employees  our supply chain network and our partners. I want to thank each team member involved in helping create and execute our investment strategy so that  together  we can achieve our industry-leading carbon neutrality ambition.”As part of its Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan  Stellantis is investing more than €50 billion in electrification over the next decade and is on track to become a carbon net zero corporation by 2038  all scopes included  with single-digit percentage compensation of remaining emissions. South America plays a leading role in the “third engine” - the aggregation of the South America  Middle East & Africa and China and India & Asia Pacific segments - and is a thriving contributor to growing Stellantis’ revenue targets outside North America and Europe.New Propulsion Systems Featuring Bio-Hybrid TechnologiesOne of the beneficiaries of this investment are the cutting-edge Bio-Hybrid technologies  which combine electrification with hybrid engines powered by bio-fuels (ethanol) on three different levels. The Stellantis facility in Betim  Brazil is the Company’s global center of expertise for Bio-Hybrid technology  continuing its legacy of innovation. Stellantis  under the Fiat brand  pioneered the development and application of bio-fuel engine technology  which used 100% ethanol.

The planned investments will support the launch of more than 40 new products during the period as well as the development of new Bio-Hybrid technologies  innovative decarbonization technologies across the automotive supply chain  and strategic new business opportunities.The investment from Stellantis reinforces its leadership in the region  strengthens the development of the local industry  and accelerates its achievement of the Dare Forward 2030 long-term strategic plan as the region maintains its leadership in offering clean  safe and affordable mobility in Brazil and South America.“This announcement solidifies our trust and commitment in the future of the South American automotive industry and is a response to the favorable business environment here ” said Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares. “As a critical part of our ‘third engine’ growth strategy  South America will take a leading role in accelerating the decarbonization of mobility together with our employees  our supply chain network and our partners. I want to thank each team member involved in helping create and execute our investment strategy so that  together  we can achieve our industry-leading carbon neutrality ambition.”As part of its Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan  Stellantis is investing more than €50 billion in electrification over the next decade and is on track to become a carbon net zero corporation by 2038  all scopes included  with single-digit percentage compensation of remaining emissions. South America plays a leading role in the “third engine” - the aggregation of the South America  Middle East & Africa and China and India & Asia Pacific segments - and is a thriving contributor to growing Stellantis’ revenue targets outside North America and Europe.New Propulsion Systems Featuring Bio-Hybrid TechnologiesOne of the beneficiaries of this investment are the cutting-edge Bio-Hybrid technologies  which combine electrification with hybrid engines powered by bio-fuels (ethanol) on three different levels. The Stellantis facility in Betim  Brazil is the Company’s global center of expertise for Bio-Hybrid technology  continuing its legacy of innovation. Stellantis  under the Fiat brand  pioneered the development and application of bio-fuel engine technology  which used 100% ethanol. In the future  the region will also produce a battery electric vehicle (BEV).The production of the first vehicles equipped with Bio-Hybrid technology is flexible and can be integrated into various models manufactured by Stellantis. It is compatible with all production lines of the Company in the region. The new hybrid and electric technologies are expected to strengthen Brazilian engineering and the domestic industry. The Bio-Hybrid technology is supported by three hybrid powertrains that will be gradually produced and introduced to the market. These new technologies include Bio-Hybrid  Bio-Hybrid electrified dual-clutch transmissions (eDCT)  Bio-Hybrid Plug-In  and BEV (100% electric). The new hybrid technologies will start to be available by the end of 2024.Stellantis Strengthening in South AmericaStellantis is the leader in the three main markets in South America: Brazil  Argentina  and Chile. Last year  Stellantis total sales in the region surpassed 878 000 vehicles  with a 23.5% market share. The Company is the sales leader in Brazil with a 31.4% market share and maintains leadership in light commercial vehicle sales in South America  with a 28.6% market share. Fiat is the best-selling brand in Brazil and South America  and the Fiat Strada pickup is the best-selling vehicle in the country and the region.With this investment  Stellantis will be increasingly prepared to design  develop  and produce modern cars in the region  while also expanding its business. In Argentina  for instance  the company acquired a 19.9% stake in Argentina Litio y Energía S.A.  a significant step toward establishing a cluster of sustainable battery materials to meet the electrification goals outlined in its global plan.In addition  with the acquisitions of companies Norauto and DPaschoal  Stellantis has become the largest auto parts distributor in South America and has plans to further expand its presence in the aftermarket segment.# # #About StellantisStellantis N.V.

Since 31 December 2020 Eurotunnel has been developing the smart border to ensure that the Tunnel remains the fastest  most reliable  easiest  and most environmentally friendly way to cross the Channel. Since it opened in 1994  almost 500 million people and more than 102 million vehicles have travelled through the Channel Tunnel. This unique land link  which carries 25% of trade between the Continent and the UK  has become a vital link  reinforced by the ElecLink electricity interconnector installed in the Tunnel  which helps to balance the energy needs between France and the UK. Getlink completes its sustainable mobility services with its rail freight subsidiary Europorte. Committed to ""low carbon"" services that control their impact on the environment (through its activities  the Group avoids the equivalent of 1.9 million tonnes of CO 2 per year)   Getlink has made the place of people  nature and territories a central concern.https://www.getlinkgroup.com1 The notice of meeting will be published in the BALO (Bulletin des Annonces Légales et Obligatoires) on 6 March 2024 and will be available on the Company's website.2 The current version of Article 19 of the Articles of Association stipulates that the Chairman's term of office expires on the date of the ordinary general meeting called to approve the financial statements for the year in which the age limit (70) is reached.

This collaboration aims to establish Metrodora Institute as the first U.S. Center of Excellence that will serve as the model of patient care and physician training on the use of Cellvizio for identifying and treating food intolerances in patients suffering from Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). The Cellvizio Food Intolerance Test (C-FIT) offers a groundbreaking approach to diagnosing food intolerances  providing a real-time visualization of the intestinal barrier during a food challenge.In the United States  about 10-15%1 of the general adult population suffers from IBS  a condition reportedly linked to atypical food intolerance in the majority of cases  characterized by a group of symptoms including abdominal pain  bloating  and changes in bowel habits (diarrhea  constipation  or both). This condition significantly affects the quality of life of those affected who often face a protracted and distressing journey of medical consultation that could last 2 to 3 years on average with no guaranteed path to identifying the underlying cause of their symptoms.""This partnership is perfectly aligned with our strategic ambition and represents a significant step forward in expanding the use of Cellvizio in the food intolerance markets. The Cellvizio U.S. Center of Excellence at the Metrodora Institute serves as a key driver in increasing awareness among the medical and patient communities about C-FIT  positioning it as a benchmark method for food intolerance detection""  said Sacha Loiseau  Ph.D.  Founder  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Mauna Kea Technologies. ""There is an urgent  unmet need for the immense pool of IBS patients who endure debilitating daily complications. It is crucial to swiftly extend the C-FIT procedure to as broad an audience as possible.""Metrodora was established in 2021 as a multidisciplinary care and research center for people with neuroimmune disorders  including neurogastrointestinal disorders. Metrodora’s state-of-the-art ambulatory surgery center in Salt Lake City  Utah  offers advanced diagnostic and therapeutic procedures to evaluate and treat a range of complex and routine conditions.“We couldn’t be more excited about being named the first U.S. Center of Excellence for implementing and serving as a healthcare model for the C-FIT procedure ” said John Wirthlin  CEO  Metrodora Institute. “Many patients live with undiagnosed food intolerances  simply because existing testing methods cannot identify the underlying issues. Our vision is that Metrodora Institute will adopt novel technologies like Cellvizio to improve the lives of the patients we serve.”***About Mauna Kea TechnologiesMauna Kea Technologies is a global medical device company that manufactures and sells Cellvizio®  the real-time in vivo cellular imaging platform.

Our objectives for 2024 are therefore logically focused on revitalizing our sales activity in all the regions we cover. Thus  following the capital increase carried out on February 2  2024  we now have the resources we need to continue expanding our product offer and strengthening our international presence  particularly in the United States. The appointment of Max W. Painter as Vice President and General Manager of Implanet America is a decisive first step in ensuring the deployment of our innovative solutions in this critical market. We also look forward to Sanyou Medical's commercial launch of our proprietary JAZZ® range in China  scheduled for later this year. Finally  as a result of the close collaboration between the teams of our reference shareholder  Sanyou Medical  and our R&D team  we are finalizing the development of a unique range of hybrid posterior fixation systems for the European market  which should be completed this year. All these achievements  coupled with our new medical equipment distribution activity  should enable us to strengthen our sales momentum in our main markets and return to growth in the years ahead.”In € thousands - IFRS - Simplified income statement 2023 2022 Change % Revenue 7 447 8 028 -7% Cost of goods sold -3 215 -3 067 5% Gross margin 4 233 4 961 -15% Gross margin % 56.8% 61.8% -5.0 bp Operating costs -10 295 -8 930 15% Recurring operating profit/loss -6 063 -3 968 -53% Other non-recurring operating income and expenses -325 - n.a Operating profit/loss -6 388 -3 968 -61% Financial profit/loss -288 428 -n.a Net result -6 676 -3 540 -89% *Unaudited figuresRevenueOverall  the Company reported revenue of €7.45 million in 2023  compared with full-year revenue of €8.03 million in 2022.Spine activity recorded revenue of €7.07 million in 2023  compared with €7.93 million in 2022. Revenue in France remained stable at €3.45 million. Revenue in the United States in 2023 amounted to €1.36 million  down 18% from €1.67 million in the previous year  due to the poor performance in the second half of 2023. Export revenue in the Rest of the World also fell by 23% over the period  to €2.26 million in 2023 from €2.93 million in 2022.The medical equipment distribution activity generated €0.30 million in 2023.Gross margin and operating lossThe gross margin amounted to €4.23 million in 2023  compared with €4.96 million in 2022  a decline of around 5 basis points. This decrease is mainly due to the product mix  with the launch of the SMTP medical equipment ranges and the minimally invasive pedicle screw positioning system driving down the margin rate from 61.8% to 56.8%.At the same time  the Company's operating costs rose from €8.93 million to €10.30 million. This €1.37 million increase is due to the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets associated with the company OSD in the amount of €1.75 million. This impairment considers the possible cannibalization of existing OSD products by the launch of a new range of hybrid posterior fixation systems planned jointly with Sanyou Medical in 2024.Excluding the impact of this impairment  the Company continued its strict control of operating expenses over the period.As a result  the recurring operating loss increased by 53% to -€6.06 million in 2023  compared with -€3.97 million in 2022.Other non-recurring expenses correspond to restructuring costs at the U.S. subsidiary and the renegotiation of financial debt. Taking into account these various items  non-recurring exceptional expenses of €0.33 million and net financial loss of €0.29 million  net result for 2023 stands at €6.68 million  compared with €3.54 million for 2022.Cash positionAs of December 31  2023  Implanet’s cash position stood at €0.25 million.On February 2  2024  the Company announced the completion of a €5.5 million capital increase. The net proceeds of this capital increase amounted to 5.3 M€.As mentioned in its press releases of October 11 and December 11  2023  the Company redeemed the bond loan contracted in October 2023 for a total amount of €1.3 million.The Company also concluded an agreement with some of its lenders (Banque Populaire Méditerranée  Bpifrance  Région Nouvelle Aquitaine and Société Générale) to reschedule part of its financial debt over the remaining term of each of the loans concerned  whose maturity has been extended by nine months. This agreement took effect on March 4  2024.In view of these elements  and the cash consumption forecasts based on current activity assumptions and anticipated business developments with Sanyou Medical over the 2024 and 2025 financial years  the Company considers that it will be able to cover the financing requirements of its operations for the next twelve months.Corporate governanceAs mentioned in its previous press releases  and in particular that of February 2  2024  on the completion of the capital increase announced on January 4  2024  Sanyou Medical asked to benefit from the majority of directorships on the Company's Board of Directors as of the completion of the said capital increase.During its meeting on March 5  2024  Ms. Paula Ness Speers  Ms. Mary Shaughnessy and Mr. Jean Gérard Galvez each tendered their resignations from the Company's Board of Directors.

In both groups  the clinical improvement exceeded the conventional definition of clinical meaningfulness  in which a 15-letter gain is considered meaningful. The safety profile of the gene therapy continues to be favorable and comparable between bilaterally treated patients and unilaterally treated patients.The results were presented at the 2024 annual meeting of the North American Neuro-Ophthalmology Society (NANOS) and will also be presented at other major medical conferences in Europe and the US later this year. Dr. Chiara La Morgia  MD  PhD  of the IRCCS Institute of Neurological Sciences of Bologna and the University of Bologna  Italy  presented the results at NANOS and commented  “It is very reassuring to clinicians that as successive waves of data become available  we continue to obtain a consistent picture of significant visual improvement among most patients treated with lenadogene nolparvovec. The evidence is becoming more robust  which is relevant for patients who are struck by a severe blinding disease such as LHON.”These latest analyses are able to draw upon a more robust sample than the early view of the data released in March 20232. In particular  the improvements at one year post-treatment and beyond provide a more definitive view of the upward trajectory of mean visual acuity (see Figure 1).One year after treatment  responder analyses show that the visual improvements accrue to the majority of patients: 63.2% of the eyes of bilaterally injected patients reached a clinically meaningful level of improvement in BCVA (≥0.3 LogMAR or +15 ETDRS letters)  as did 57.9% of eyes of unilaterally injected patients. Nine months after injection  the average visual acuity corresponded to on-chart vision  compared to off-chart average visual acuity at baseline.The safety results obtained in the EAPs were consistent with those observed in the clinical studies  showing a favorable safety profile of lenadogene nolparvovec. Notably  intraocular inflammation events reported in LUMEVOQ®-treated eyes were comparable in frequency  intensity  and location to those observed in the clinical studies.“Witnessing results like these energizes the GenSight team’s drive to restore early access availability for eligible patients by Q3 this year ” said Laurence Rodriguez  Chief Executive Officer of GenSight. “As the evidence accumulates that access to LUMEVOQ helps LHON patients  in clinical trials and in real-life settings  we are working on all options to bring LUMEVOQ to patients as quickly as possible.”LUMEVOQ® (GS010; lenadogene nolparvovec) was made available through EAPs in selected countries based on unsolicited requests from clinicians and where authorized for early access use by local regulations in those countries. The Company aims to resume early access in France under the Autorisation de l’accès compassionnel (AAC) program in Q3 2024.About GenSight BiologicsGenSight Biologics S.A. is a clinical-stage biopharma company focused on discovering and developing innovative gene therapies for retinal neurodegenerative diseases and central nervous system disorders. GenSight Biologics’ pipeline leverages two core technology platforms  the Mitochondrial Targeting Sequence (MTS) and optogenetics  to help preserve or restore vision in patients suffering from blinding retinal diseases. Using its gene therapy-based approach  GenSight Biologics’ product candidates are designed to be administered in a single treatment to each eye by intravitreal injection to offer patients a sustainable functional visual recovery.About Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON)Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON) is a rare maternally inherited mitochondrial genetic disease  characterized by the degeneration of retinal ganglion cells that results in brutal and irreversible vision loss that can lead to legal blindness  and mainly affects adolescents and young adults. LHON is associated with painless  sudden loss of central vision in the 1st eye  with the 2nd eye sequentially impaired. It is a symmetric disease with poor functional visual recovery. 97% of subjects have bilateral involvement at less than one year of onset of vision loss  and in 25% of cases  vision loss occurs in both eyes simultaneously.About LUMEVOQ® (GS010; lenadogene nolparvovec)LUMEVOQ® (GS010; lenadogene nolparvovec) targets Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON) by leveraging a mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) proprietary technology platform  arising from research conducted at the Institut de la Vision in Paris  which  when associated with the gene of interest  allows the platform to specifically address defects inside the mitochondria using an AAV vector (Adeno-Associated Virus). The gene of interest is transferred into the cell to be expressed and produces the functional protein  which will then be shuttled to the mitochondria through specific nucleotidic sequences in order to restore the missing or deficient mitochondrial function. “LUMEVOQ” was accepted as the invented name for GS010 (lenadogene nolparvovec) by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in October 2018. LUMEVOQ® (GS010; lenadogene nolparvovec) has not been registered in any country at this stage._________________________________ 1 Nadir = lowest observed visual acuity between baseline (time of treatment) and the time point of interest. 2 “GenSight Biologics Announces Presentation of LUMEVOQ® Efficacy and Safety Data from Early Access Programs for ND4-LHON Patients at NANOS 2023”  press release  March 15  2023View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240305810568/en/,neutral,0.02,0.97,0.0,positive,0.57,0.41,0.02,True,English,"['Early Access Programs', 'LUMEVOQ® Gene Therapy', 'GenSight Biologics', 'Real-World Data', 'Update', 'NANOS 2024', 'rare maternally inherited mitochondrial genetic disease', 'central nervous system disorders', 'Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy', 'North American Neuro-Ophthalmology Society', 'other major medical conferences', 'Dr. Chiara La Morgia', 'two core technology platforms', 'sustainable functional visual recovery', 'GenSight Biologics’ product candidates', 'GenSight Biologics S.A.', 'recent prospective real-world data', 'chart mean visual acuity', 'chart average visual acuity', 'severe blinding disease', 'Mitochondrial Targeting Sequence', 'accès compassionnel', 'corrected visual acuity', 'intraocular inflammation events', 'Chief Executive Officer', 'innovative gene therapies', 'gene therapy-based approach', 'retinal ganglion cells', 'GenSight Biologics’ pipeline', 'higher responder rate', 'retinal neurodegenerative diseases', '18-letter average gain', 'favorable safety profile', 'significant visual improvement', 'early access programs', 'one year post-treatment', 'early access availability', 'early access use', 'clinical-stage biopharma company', 'LUMEVOQ®-treated eyes', 'retinal diseases', 'real-world setting', 'visual improvements', 'early view', 'GenSight team', 'responder analyses', 'chart vision', '15-letter gain', 'The Company', 'meaningful improvement', '+23 ETDRS letters', '+18 ETDRS letters', 'press release', 'full release', 'Business Wire', 'ND4 mutation', 'clinical trials', 'clinical improvement', 'conventional definition', 'clinical meaningfulness', '2024 annual meeting', 'IRCCS Institute', 'Neurological Sciences', 'successive waves', 'consistent picture', 'lenadogene nolparvovec', 'latest analyses', 'robust sample', 'definitive view', 'upward trajectory', 'meaningful level', '+15 ETDRS letters', 'safety results', 'clinical studies', 'Laurence Rodriguez', 'real-life settings', 'unsolicited requests', 'local regulations', 'AAC) program', 'Regulatory News', 'Witnessing results', 'single treatment', 'intravitreal injection', 'most patients', 'eligible patients', 'baseline Eyes', 'LHON patients', '9 months', 'similar', 'multimedia', 'businesswire', 'Graphic', 'Euronext', 'ISIN', 'PEA-PME', 'commercializing', 'EAP', 'benefit', '4-LHON', 'nadir1', 'BCVA', 'groups', 'NANOS', 'Europe', 'MD', 'PhD', 'Bologna', 'University', 'Italy', 'clinicians', 'evidence', 'March', 'Figure', 'majority', '0.3 LogMAR', 'frequency', 'intensity', 'location', 'drive', 'Q3', 'options', 'countries', 'France', 'Autorisation', 'MTS', 'optogenetics', 'degeneration', 'brutal']",2024-03-06,2024-03-07,marketscreener.com

In both groups  the clinical improvement exceeded the conventional definition of clinical meaningfulness  in which a 15-letter gain is considered meaningful. The safety profile of the gene therapy continues to be favorable and comparable between bilaterally treated patients and unilaterally treated patients.The results were presented at the 2024 annual meeting of the North American Neuro-Ophthalmology Society (NANOS) and will also be presented at other major medical conferences in Europe and the US later this year.

At the same time  Global Bioenergies received financial support from ADEME for the Prénidem project  which enabled the Company to record €0.8 million in grant income over the 2023 financial year.Details of operating expenses(€ thousands) 2023 2022 2021 Personnel 4 553 4 287 4 091 Industrialization/Commercialization 8 778 6 713 8 117 Laboratory 346 343 680 Rentals and maintenance 1 034 850 834 Intellectual property 390 323 562 Amortization 1 590 703 1 474 Other 1 931 1 688 1 471 TOTAL 18 621 14 907 17 229Operating expenses are increasing with the production of several tons of Isonaturane™ 12  and amortization charges are up sharply following the commissioning of the Pomacle industrial production facility during 2022.• Group Balance SheetAssets (€ thousands) 31/12/23 31/12/22 31/12/21 Liabilities (€ thousands) 31/12/23 31/12/22 31/12/21 Intangible assets 327 539 800 Capital 906 749 743 Tangible assets 2 471 3 612 637 Share premium 10 538 16 029 29 289 Assets under construction 77 401 1 897 Balance carried forward -2 769 -2 708 -4 697 Financial assets 341 1 546 1 544 Profit (loss) -8 656 -11 986 -11 773 Equipment subsidies 2 758 463 - NON-CURRENT ASSETS 3 217 6 097 4 879 EQUITY 2 778 2 547 13 562 IBN and derivatives inventories 219 2 342 1 793 PROVISIONS 53 110 61 Consumables inventories 350 250 250 Receivables 2 247 3 647 3 524 Conditional advances and loans 12 451 11 486 12 454 Cash 11 673 8 768 20 931 Trade payables 2 411 5 580 3 520 Marketable securities 171 173 147 Tax and social security liabilities 559 502 1 185 Prepaid expenses 378 300 261 Other debts and deferred income 3 1 352 1 003 CURRENT ASSETS 15 038 15 480 26 907 PAYABLES and DEFERRED INCOME 15 423 18 921 18 163 TOTAL ASSETS 18 254 21 577 31 785 TOTAL LIABILITIES 18 254 21 577 31 785The balance sheet shows an increasing cash position reaching €11.7 million as of 31 December 2023  ensuring the financial visibility of the Company for the entire 2024 financial year. Furthermore  the collection of the first tranche of the financing granted by the French government as part of the France 2030 plan for the construction of the world's first full-size biosourced isobutene plant (€4.1 million) leads to an increase in the equipment subsidies item.2023 highlights and recent eventsSuccessful commercialization of the first tons of Isonaturane™ 12 to several customers including L'OréalIn the first half of 2023  Global Bioenergies successfully supplied several tons of Isonaturane™ to major players in the cosmetics industry  including L'Oréal. As a reminder  Isonaturane™ is the first equivalent of natural origin to fossil isododecane  one of the most widely used ingredients in cosmetics. In both cases the structure of the molecule is the same  only its origin differs. Thanks to this unique innovation  cosmetic products  from make-up to skincare  gain in naturalness while guaranteeing customers the same level of performance.These first sales initiate the scale-up of Global Bioenergies  which is now focusing on building a full-size plant to significantly increase the quantities produced and be able to address ever larger markets. In this context  the Company has decided not to continue the activities of its brand LAST™. This brand  a showcase for the Company launched in 2021  made it possible to demonstrate the quality of its ingredients and to understand the complex cosmetics market. Its mission is now accomplished and the Company is now directing all its efforts towards its larger-scale projects.ASTM certification received for the production of sustainable aviation fuelsAs a reminder  the airline industry requires the fuel used in airplanes to be ASTM certified. Sustainable aviation fuels also undergo this complex  multi-year process  according to the ASTM D7566 standard. This standard allows them to be considered as 'drop-in' fuels  meaning they can be blended with fossil kerosene and used safely in existing airplanes and infrastructures worldwide.In June 2023  Global Bioenergies obtained this ASTM certification for its sustainable aviation fuels production technology. This is the starting point for the Company to position itself in the emerging SAF market  where many questions remain unanswered: Which technologies will be the most mature? Which technologies will be the most commercially competitive? What will be the production capacities able to meet the immense production volumes demanded by the RefuelEU regulations? Current production does not exceed 500 000 tons  whereas more than 12 million tons are expected to be needed worldwide by 2030  and will have to be multiplied by a ten-fold factor by 2050.Major public funding granted  notably for the construction of the first full-scale biobased isobutene plantThe year 2023 was also marked by the very strong support of the French government in the pursuit of the Company's activities. With the signing of the so-called ""Prénidem"" project in March 2023  ADEME is once again supporting the Group's technological optimization activities to the tune of €4.4 million. The French government then granted Global Bioenergies a €16.4 million package (in the form of subsidies and repayable advances) to build the world's first full-scale biobased isobutene plant  designed to produce ingredients for the cosmetics industry. The first tranche of financing  amounting to €4.1 million  was received at the end of 2023.Continued collaboration with Shell in the development of low carbon road fuelsAt the beginning of 2023  the Company signed an extension to the collaboration agreement established the previous year with Shell for low-carbon road fuel production pathways. Following the conclusions of this research  a new phase of collaboration was initiated in January 2024 to support a specific technology pathway.Continuing to structure teamsIn order to support and accelerate the evolution of its activities towards industry and commercialization  the Company has recruited several new positions. On the industrial side  an experienced Industrial Director and an LCA Project Manager have been recruited to carry out our future plant project in accordance with our environmental convictions. On the commercial side  the recruitment of a Chief Business Officer and a Quality Manager allow the Company to meet the expectations of our customers.Progress of our CSR approach: EcoVadis bronze medal and concrete actionsFor its first evaluation  Global Bioenergies has reached the top 30% of the best performing companies in terms of CSR among the 110 000 companies evaluated worldwide by the rating agency. This award recognizes the CSR approach adopted by the entire company over the last few years  which has led to a 30% reduction in electricity consumption at the Evry laboratory between 2021 and 2023. In 2023 alone  the savings of 100 MWh are equivalent to the private consumption of all Global Bioenergies employees.Increase in the resources allocated to the liquidity contract with the brokerage firm Gilbert DupontUnder the liquidity contract entrusted by Global Bioenergies to the brokerage firm Gilbert Dupont  an additional contribution of €50 000 was made on 6 March 2024.As a reminder  on the full-year report of 29 December 2023  the following assets appeared on the liquidity account:Number of shares: 11 427Cash balance of the liquidity account: €16 691.74About GLOBAL BIOENERGIESGlobal Bioenergies substitutes products of fossil origin with products of natural origin. In their quest for naturalness without compromising on performance  the cosmetics players are the Company's first customers. By 2027  the Company will be operating its innovative process in a large-scale plant. By 2030  the Company plans to become a leader in the huge emerging market for sustainable aviation fuels  in order to fight against global warming.

At the same time  Global Bioenergies received financial support from ADEME for the Prénidem project  which enabled the Company to record €0.8 million in grant income over the 2023 financial year.Details of operating expenses(€ thousands) 2023 2022 2021 Personnel 4 553 4 287 4 091 Industrialization/Commercialization 8 778 6 713 8 117 Laboratory 346 343 680 Rentals and maintenance 1 034 850 834 Intellectual property 390 323 562 Amortization 1 590 703 1 474 Other 1 931 1 688 1 471 TOTAL 18 621 14 907 17 229Operating expenses are increasing with the production of several tons of Isonaturane™ 12  and amortization charges are up sharply following the commissioning of the Pomacle industrial production facility during 2022.• Group Balance SheetAssets (€ thousands) 31/12/23 31/12/22 31/12/21 Liabilities (€ thousands) 31/12/23 31/12/22 31/12/21 Intangible assets 327 539 800 Capital 906 749 743 Tangible assets 2 471 3 612 637 Share premium 10 538 16 029 29 289 Assets under construction 77 401 1 897 Balance carried forward -2 769 -2 708 -4 697 Financial assets 341 1 546 1 544 Profit (loss) -8 656 -11 986 -11 773 Equipment subsidies 2 758 463 - NON-CURRENT ASSETS 3 217 6 097 4 879 EQUITY 2 778 2 547 13 562 IBN and derivatives inventories 219 2 342 1 793 PROVISIONS 53 110 61 Consumables inventories 350 250 250 Receivables 2 247 3 647 3 524 Conditional advances and loans 12 451 11 486 12 454 Cash 11 673 8 768 20 931 Trade payables 2 411 5 580 3 520 Marketable securities 171 173 147 Tax and social security liabilities 559 502 1 185 Prepaid expenses 378 300 261 Other debts and deferred income 3 1 352 1 003 CURRENT ASSETS 15 038 15 480 26 907 PAYABLES and DEFERRED INCOME 15 423 18 921 18 163 TOTAL ASSETS 18 254 21 577 31 785 TOTAL LIABILITIES 18 254 21 577 31 785The balance sheet shows an increasing cash position reaching €11.7 million as of 31 December 2023  ensuring the financial visibility of the Company for the entire 2024 financial year. Furthermore  the collection of the first tranche of the financing granted by the French government as part of the France 2030 plan for the construction of the world's first full-size biosourced isobutene plant (€4.1 million) leads to an increase in the equipment subsidies item.2023 highlights and recent eventsSuccessful commercialization of the first tons of Isonaturane™ 12 to several customers including L'OréalIn the first half of 2023  Global Bioenergies successfully supplied several tons of Isonaturane™ to major players in the cosmetics industry  including L'Oréal. As a reminder  Isonaturane™ is the first equivalent of natural origin to fossil isododecane  one of the most widely used ingredients in cosmetics. In both cases the structure of the molecule is the same  only its origin differs. Thanks to this unique innovation  cosmetic products  from make-up to skincare  gain in naturalness while guaranteeing customers the same level of performance.These first sales initiate the scale-up of Global Bioenergies  which is now focusing on building a full-size plant to significantly increase the quantities produced and be able to address ever larger markets. In this context  the Company has decided not to continue the activities of its brand LAST™. This brand  a showcase for the Company launched in 2021  made it possible to demonstrate the quality of its ingredients and to understand the complex cosmetics market. Its mission is now accomplished and the Company is now directing all its efforts towards its larger-scale projects.ASTM certification received for the production of sustainable aviation fuelsAs a reminder  the airline industry requires the fuel used in airplanes to be ASTM certified. Sustainable aviation fuels also undergo this complex  multi-year process  according to the ASTM D7566 standard. This standard allows them to be considered as 'drop-in' fuels  meaning they can be blended with fossil kerosene and used safely in existing airplanes and infrastructures worldwide.In June 2023  Global Bioenergies obtained this ASTM certification for its sustainable aviation fuels production technology. This is the starting point for the Company to position itself in the emerging SAF market  where many questions remain unanswered: Which technologies will be the most mature? Which technologies will be the most commercially competitive? What will be the production capacities able to meet the immense production volumes demanded by the RefuelEU regulations? Current production does not exceed 500 000 tons  whereas more than 12 million tons are expected to be needed worldwide by 2030  and will have to be multiplied by a ten-fold factor by 2050.Major public funding granted  notably for the construction of the first full-scale biobased isobutene plantThe year 2023 was also marked by the very strong support of the French government in the pursuit of the Company's activities. With the signing of the so-called ""Prénidem"" project in March 2023  ADEME is once again supporting the Group's technological optimization activities to the tune of €4.4 million. The French government then granted Global Bioenergies a €16.4 million package (in the form of subsidies and repayable advances) to build the world's first full-scale biobased isobutene plant  designed to produce ingredients for the cosmetics industry. The first tranche of financing  amounting to €4.1 million  was received at the end of 2023.Continued collaboration with Shell in the development of low carbon road fuelsAt the beginning of 2023  the Company signed an extension to the collaboration agreement established the previous year with Shell for low-carbon road fuel production pathways. Following the conclusions of this research  a new phase of collaboration was initiated in January 2024 to support a specific technology pathway.Continuing to structure teamsIn order to support and accelerate the evolution of its activities towards industry and commercialization  the Company has recruited several new positions. On the industrial side  an experienced Industrial Director and an LCA Project Manager have been recruited to carry out our future plant project in accordance with our environmental convictions. On the commercial side  the recruitment of a Chief Business Officer and a Quality Manager allow the Company to meet the expectations of our customers.Progress of our CSR approach: EcoVadis bronze medal and concrete actionsFor its first evaluation  Global Bioenergies has reached the top 30% of the best performing companies in terms of CSR among the 110 000 companies evaluated worldwide by the rating agency. This award recognizes the CSR approach adopted by the entire company over the last few years  which has led to a 30% reduction in electricity consumption at the Evry laboratory between 2021 and 2023. In 2023 alone  the savings of 100 MWh are equivalent to the private consumption of all Global Bioenergies employees.Increase in the resources allocated to the liquidity contract with the brokerage firm Gilbert DupontUnder the liquidity contract entrusted by Global Bioenergies to the brokerage firm Gilbert Dupont  an additional contribution of €50 000 was made on 6 March 2024.As a reminder  on the full-year report of 29 December 2023  the following assets appeared on the liquidity account:Number of shares: 11 427Cash balance of the liquidity account: €16 691.74About GLOBAL BIOENERGIESGlobal Bioenergies substitutes products of fossil origin with products of natural origin. In their quest for naturalness without compromising on performance  the cosmetics players are the Company's first customers. By 2027  the Company will be operating its innovative process in a large-scale plant. By 2030  the Company plans to become a leader in the huge emerging market for sustainable aviation fuels  in order to fight against global warming.

With a strong financial position  the Group is advancing the development of its commercial portfolio and residential property development activities in a secure and cautious manner  particularly in island markets where demand remains substantial »  says Géraldine Neyret  Chief Executive Officer of CBo Territoria.The Board of Directors of CBo Territoria (ISIN: FR0010193979 - CBOT)  a significant real estate player in La Réunion for nearly two decades  met on Wednesday  March 6  2024  to approve the consolidated financial accounts for the fiscal year ended December 31  2023. Audits of the consolidated financial statements are underway.CHANGES IN THE ECONOMIC PORTFOLIOCBo Territoria is pursuing a property investment strategy and  as of the end of December 2023  held a diversified portfolio of commercial properties[6] with strong foundations:a rise in value of +6.1% to €318.9 million excluding transfer taxes compared with year-end 2022 (commercial assets represents 86% of total assets[7]) upon the delivery of the Ylang Ylang shopping center in October 2023. Total surface area stands at 140 800 sq.m. (100% contribution of equity affiliates) to excluding transfer taxes compared with year-end 2022 (commercial assets represents 86% of total assets[7]) upon the delivery of the Ylang Ylang shopping center in October 2023. Total surface area stands at 140 800 sq.m. (100% contribution of equity affiliates)  a high and stable occupancy rate of 98%  confirming the quality of the assets held annualized gross rental income of €26.9 million (including equity affiliates' contribution) versus €23.8 million at year-end 2022 a gross yield including transfer duties of 8.0% (vs. 7.4% at the end of 2022).Following the sale of 135 units to SHLMR in December 2023  the Group owned only 79 housing units at the end of December 2023[8]  which will be sold in the medium term.The Group's overall economic portfolio6 is valued at €371.8 million  minus transfer duties  which is stable compared to year-end 2022 (€373.0 million)  with residential unit disposals (-€19.4 million) almost totally offset by deliveries  net of value adjustments. The overall value of the portfolio minus transfer duties (including ongoing commercial projects for €5.8 million) reached €377.6 million by the end of December 2023 (vs. €388.1 million at the end of 2022).2023 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCEProperty Investment: Recurring net income of €12.5 million (+13.8%)In 2023  gross rental income from the commercial economic portfolio increased by 11.3% to €26.5 million. The increase is divided into three components: +2.4% scope effect (€0.6 million)  +4.0% indexation effect (€0.9 million)  and +4.9% other effects (for €1.2 million  including a €0.9 million non-recurring effect of variable rents).Net commercial rents increased by +8.3% to €24.5 million (including a €3.5 million contribution of equity affiliates).Net rental revenue from residential assets  agricultural lands  and miscellaneous was €1.4 million in 2023 (compared to €2.2 million in 2022)  accounting for the full-year impact of housing disposals in 2022.The property investment business reported a recurring net income of €12.5 million  up 13.8% year on year.Property Development: a €8.9m margin (-27%) impacted by the change in mix  with a high margin rate of 15.4%.At the end of 2023  CBo Territoria had achieved a level of reservations (order book) of €24.1 million (compared to €39.7 million in 2022)  consisting solely of residential programs  with €16.4 million in blocks to be launched soon (Aloe Macra)  €6.2 million (35 units) for building plots  and €1.5 million in retail sales  corresponding to the last available land plots on projects currently in construction. The supply at the end of December consisted solely of 131 building plots for €25 million (compared to €20.5 million at the end of 2022 for all product kinds). Despite this  the outlook remains positive  with a residential backlog of €29.0 million. The Group intends to launch three programs in the next few months: Aloe Macra (76 lots under reservation contract with SHLMR) and two programs totaling 135 lots presently on the marketing phase.Property development revenue reached €58.1 million in 2023  up 1.5% year on year. Residential revenue accounted for 93% of total sales (80% in 2022) at €54.0 million  an increase of 18.8%  led by block sales  which accounted for 43% of residential sales in 2023 (+53% to €23.3 million). This was followed by retail sales of €19.1 million (35% of residential sales)  which increased by 66%  owing in large part to the rush effect of the Pinel DOM programs at year-end 2022. As a result  the product mix has shifted dramatically in the past twelve months. For the record  plot sales accounted for 41% of 2022 sales (22% in 2023)  with the majority occurring in the western tourism zone  resulting in unusually high margins.Commercial property development revenue is limited due to the opportunistic nature of the business. In 2023  il amounted to €4.1 million (compared to €11.8 million in 2022)  reflecting the completion of the EPSMR facilities delivered in March and the disposal of the last available commercial plot in the Portail area.Overall  the margin rate remains high  at 15.4% (versus 21.4% in 2022)  reflecting the shift in the product/activity mix  with a promotion margin of €8.9 million (-27%).Earnings from operations €25.1 million (-5.0%) and Net income (Group share) €14.1 million (-11.7%)Revenue from business operations  71% of which is a net rental income from the property investment division  decreased by -5.0% to €25.1 million in 2023 due to weaker margins in property development (base effect in 2022 due to the very high contribution from land in the tourism zone).The change in fair value was -€2.8 million (-€4.5 million in 2022)  with the benefit of lower interest rates somewhat offset by the delivery of the Ylang Ylang shopping center in Combani and the impact of rent indexation.The cost of net financial debt is -€5.3 million (vs. -€5.1 million in 2022).In the absence of capital gains on disposals and other operating income compared with 2022 (capital gains on agricultural land disposals and income from the sale of control of Outdoor activities totaling +€2.0 million)  net income group share came to €14.1 million versus €16.0 million (-11.7%)  or €0.39/share (versus €0.45 in 2022).Net Asset Value (NAV): €241.8 million (+1.8% vs. end 2022)Net Asset Value was €241.8 million on December 31  2023  compared to €237.5 million at the end of December 2022 (+1.8%). The €4.3 million rise year on year is due to the period's earnings (€14.1 million)  which cover the €8.6 million 2022 dividend distribution and €1.2 million in other adjustments (including €1.4 million in mark-to-market on hedging instruments). On a per-share basis  NAV improved by 1.8% in 12 months to €6.75 (from €6.63 at year-end 2022).Solid financial structure and cash position - Diversified  secure debt profileCBo Territoria issued a new Ornane[9] by private placement in June 2023  maturing in June 2028 for €15.1 million  replacing the Ornane issued in 2018 (for €30 million) and due in July 2024. This transaction has allowed the Group to maintain diversification of its financing sources while also confirming institutional investors' confidence (the majority of whom had already subscribed to the previous issue) in its development model in an economic climate that is still more demanding for publicly traded real estate companies.In 2023  the Group repaid almost €52.9 million in loans. In addition to the annual contractual repayments  the Group repaid €22.6 million of Ornane 2018 and €11.3 million early following the sale of housing assets to SHLMR.At the end of 2023  the Group's gross financial debt was €179.1 million  down from €195.4 million at the end of 2022. Mortgage financing accounted for 80% of the total  with the remaining balance made up of outstanding Ornanes  the PGE (state-guaranteed loan) that is currently being amortized  and the PPR (Prêt Participatif Relance). Following these operations  CBo Territoria has an excellent cash position of €34.7 million  including €9.1 million in term deposits[10].After accounting for hedging instruments  87% of financial debt is at fixed rates. The average debt cost was 3.5% (vs. 2.9% on December 31  2022)  with a maturity of 8 years and 5 months (+4 months compared to the end of 2022).At year-end 2023  the LTV ratio excluding transfer duties was 32.7%  compared to 36.8% in 2022 for a covenant of ≤55%. The ICR reached 4.2x (compared to 3.5x at the end of 2022 for a covenant of ≥ 1.8x). The net debt/Ebitda ratio remains high at 5.0x (compared to 5.5x at the end of 2022).Proposed dividend for 2023 is constant at €0.24 per share.In relation to the fiscal year 2023  CBo Territoria will recommend to the Annual General Meeting on May 2  2024  the payment in full in cash of a stable dividend of €0.24 per share  ensuring the preservation of a balanced distribution between financing the development of the Property Investment business and rewarding shareholders. The dividend will be paid on June 14  2024  with the ex-dividend date set for June 12.2024 OUTLOOKFor the whole year  the Group expects a 4% increase in gross commercial rents (including equity affiliate contributions)  taking into account the ramp-up and full-year impact of the Ylang Ylang shopping center  which will be delivered in October 2023  and the delivery of Pôle Emploi offices in Q3 2024.In residential property development  against a more challenging environment  the Group has strong expectations for buildings  particularly considering the share of block sales  and slightly lower forecasts for building plots  which take longer to sell due to buyers' credit constraints.For the Property Investment side  the pipeline[11] of commercial projects under development to date represents €76 million of investment  including the offices currently under construction in Mayotte (Pôle Emploi) and €24 million of projects to be launched within 12-18 months  depending on the progress of their commercial launch  including the Galabé project (4 260 sq.m.) within the Savanna commercial hub  for which the building permit was granted at the end of June 2023.This pipeline excludes the two projects awarded to the Group at the end of 2023 as part of Ecocité La Réunion's APUI Kreolab program  which began in 2022: the “La Kaz Vacoa” project (Saint-Paul)  a mixed-use development at the city's entrance  and the “La Fabrique insulaire et tropicale” project (Le Port)  a 25 000 sq.m. small-scale residential estate.A presentation accompanying this press release will be available online at 11:30 a.m. on March 7sur cboterritoria.com Finance / Financial documents section.The annual financial report will be filed with the AMF in mid-April 2024 and made available on cboterritoria.com Finance / Financial documents section.2024 Financial calendar: Annual Shareholders' Meeting - Thursday  May 2  2024 (Sainte-Marie La Réunion)About CBo Territoria (FR0010193979  CBOT)CBo Territoria has been a major real estate operator in La Réunion for nearly 20 years and has evolved into a multi-regional property developer specializing in tertiary assets (€318.9 million  representing 86% of total assets in value at 31 décembre 2023).

In a volatile economic and geopolitical environment  Teleperformance not only continued to grow its business delivering a record €8.4 billion in revenue  but also improved its operating margin by +40 basis points and its cash flow by more than +15%. Our profitability model has created one of the highest annual EBITA margins in the industry.In addition to our successes  there are challenges that we are overcoming. The global slowdown in volumes  the impact of regional crises on client decision-making processes  and the shift in consumer behavior after several years of pandemic lockdowns all slowed the Group's traditional revenue growth. In this environment  our relentless focus on maximizing operational efficiency with flawless execution enabled us to drive much faster development of our offshore solutions. Witnessing a tougher environment throughout the year  we deployed highly disciplined cost and cash management policies while adjusting our growth model. Our shareholders were rewarded as well since we returned a significant portion of the year's cash flow to them.2023 also saw the successful acquisition of Majorel  which was completed in record time and was recently honored with the “French Deal of The Year” prize awarded by Global Capital  a renowned institution in the financial sector in Europe which has been rewarding the best financial transactions for over 20 years. As a result of this acquisition  Teleperformance has given birth to a new  more diverse company  in terms of markets  client verticals and expertise. It strengthens Teleperformance’s #1 global leadership position and provides a new springboard for our future. The “new Teleperformance” represents nearly 500 000 employees  more than €10 billion in revenue and more than €2 billion in EBITDA.Innovation is at the heart of Teleperformance’s “High Touch-High Tech” strategy  including the development of AI solutions designed to increase productivity and accuracy. Today  many clients are depending on us to manage more than 250 AI-projects including projects that incorporate Gen-AI components  to help accelerate their own business results. In this highly mobile  increasingly complex world  we launched TP Infinity  whose client consulting solutions are expected to sustain and support the Group’s transformation into more high value-added business segments.People are still an important ingredient to our value proposition. In 2023  Teleperformance confirmed that it is the industry’s preeminent employer by creating many new jobs around the world in a workplace environment of excellence and employee well-being. For the first time  the Group was named one of the top five World’s Best Workplaces™ 2023 by Fortune and Great Place to Work®. For the third year in a row  Teleperformance was honored to once again be among the 25 Best Workplaces among global leaders. Teleperformance is now certified as a Great Place to Work® in 72 countries  covering more than 99% of its workforce  demonstrating the trust and engagement of our employees.In 2024  Teleperformance’s priority will be to pursue its profitable  cash-generating growth model despite the uncertain environment we are operating in today. With agility and flexibility  the Group will continue to tightly manage its costs and harvest the synergies expected to be created by the Majorel integration. We will increase the promotion of our offshore and digital solutions to meet clients’ growing demand for optimized efficiency. As a result  and taking a conservative approach  particularly for the first half  the Group is targeting pro forma* like-for-like revenue growth of +2% to +4% in 2024  pro forma* recurring EBITA margin up between +10bps and +20bps and increased cash flow.Looking beyond 2024  Teleperformance’s business fundamentals are solid in both our core business and specialized services. Over the medium term  we aim to deliver like-for-like growth outpacing the market  while continuing to improve our margins. We will also continue to pursue targeted acquisitions  particularly in specialized services.The Group recently made some important decisions concerning its governance  to prepare the future of the “new Teleperformance”. Following unanimous approval by the Board of Directors  Bhupender Singh and I will be acting as co-CEOs of the Group until the end of 2025. This decision has been taken in order to ensure a smooth leadership transition  with the objective of separating the responsibilities of Chairman and CEO after this date.""* on a pro forma 2023 basis including Majorel over 12 months2023 REVENUEConsolidated revenueRevenue amounted to €8 345 million for the year ended December 31  2023  representing a year-on-year increase of +1.7% like-for-like (at constant exchange rates and scope of consolidation).On a reported basis  revenue was up +2.3% on the prior year. The difference between like-for-like and reported growth rates stems from the net impact of:(i) the -€346 million highly negative currency effect  particularly in the second half  due to the decline against the euro in the US dollar  the Egyptian pound  the Argentine peso  the Indian rupee  the Turkish lira  the Colombian peso and the Philippine peso.(ii) the +€404 million positive impact from changes in the scope of consolidation  led by the inclusion of Majorel since November 1  2023. These changes also reflected the contributions from PSG Global Solutions since November 1  2022 and from Capita Translation & Interpreting since January 1  2023.Reported growth was dampened by the non-recurring impact of the year-on-year decline in the contribution from Covid support contracts (-€223 million over the full year)  and the adjustment for the impact of high volatility of exchange rates in countries with hyperinflationary (-€32 million)  notably in Argentina. Adjusted for these impacts  like-for-like growth stood at +5.1% for the year.Over the period  like-for-like growth* was particularly robust  given the volatile economic environment and uncertain geopolitical situation. The performance reflected the diversity of Teleperformance’s client and service lines portfolio  as well as its unrivaled global geographic footprint in nearly 100 countries.In Core Services & Digital Integrated Business Services like-for-like growth* was strong in the EMEA region but remained sluggish in the LATAM-based offshore activities and in the North America & Asia-Pacific regions.Growth was particularly varied by industry vertical. Financial services  social media  entertainment and government agencies (excluding Covid support contracts) saw the fastest growth  while retail  technology and telecoms were flat.The sustained strong momentum in offshore solutions  particularly in India  exerted downward pressure on the Group’s revenue growth over the year but had a positive impact on Group margin.Specialized Services continued to expand at a sustained pace  led by the still very fast rebound in TLSContact's visa application management business post-Covid and the steady growth in LanguageLine Solutions' interpretation business throughout the year.Fourth-quarter 2023 revenue amounted to €2 396 million  down -0.6% at constant exchange rates and scope of consolidation (like-for-like). Adjusted for the year-on-year decline in revenue from Covid support contracts and the impact of high volatility of exchange rates in countries with hyperinflation  like-for-like growth stood at +2.4%.On a reported basis  revenue was up by +11.3%  reflecting the net impact of:(i) a significant +€351 million increase from changes in the scope of consolidation  with the inclusion of Majorel  PSG Global Solutions and Capita Translation & Interpreting(ii) the highly negative -€96 million currency effect due to the decline against the euro in the US dollar  the Argentine peso  the Egyptian pound  the Turkish lira and the Philippine peso.Analysis of 2023 revenue growth[Graphic omitted]* At constant scope of consolidation and exchange rates  excluding the impact of lower revenue from Covid support contracts and the adjustment for the impact of high volatility of exchange rates in countries with hyperinflationaryRevenue by activity2023 2022 % change € millions Like-for-likeexcluding Covidsupport contracts Like-for-like Reported CORE SERVICES & D.I.B.S.* 6 982 6 989 +2.6%** -0.7% -0.1% North America & Asia-Pacific 2 534 2 679 -1.4% -1.4% -5.4% LATAM 1 569 1 653 +0.5% +0.5% -5.1% Europe & MEA (EMEA) 2 536 2 657 +8.0% -0.8% -4.6% MAJOREL 343 0 N/A N/A N/A SPECIALIZED SERVICES 1 363 1 165 +16.1% +16.1% +17.0% TOTAL 8 345 8 154 +4.6%** +1.7% +2.3%* Digital Integrated Business Services** +3.2% for Core Services and D.I.B.S. and +5.1% for the Group total on a like-for-like basis  excluding Covid support contracts and the adjustment for the impact of high volatility of exchange rates in countries with hyperinflationCore Services & Digital Integrated Business Services (D.I.B.S.)Revenue from Core Services and D.I.B.S. amounted to €6 982 million in 2023  almost stable (-0 7%) at constant exchange rates and scope of consolidation (like-for-like). Adjusted for the year-on-year decline in revenue from Covid support contracts and the impact of high volatility of exchange rates in countries with hyperinflationary (Argentina and Turkey)  like-for-like growth stood at +3.2%.Reported revenue was stable for the year (-0.1%)  reflecting:(i) the positive impact of consolidating Majorel since November 1  2023(ii) the unfavorable currency effect stemming from the decline against the euro in the Egyptian pound  the US dollar  the Colombian peso  the Indian rupee  the Turkish lira  the Philippine peso and most other operating currencies.Over the year as a whole  like-for-like growth* was relatively satisfactory given the volatile economic environment and uncertain geopolitical situation. This resilience was underpinned in particular by the diversity of both the Group's client portfolio and the geographic footprint of its activities.Business rose steadily in Europe over the period  while the North American market slowed sharply year-on-year on the back of reduced volumes post-Covid  impacting the Group’s activities in the North America & Asia-Pacific and LATAM regions. The best results were reported in the social media (content moderation)  financial services and government agency verticals (excluding Covid support contracts). On the other hand  business in technologies  retail and telecoms was flat over the year.The fast momentum in offshore solutions continued apace  particularly in India  where the Group is deploying high value-added  technology-intensive global solutions on behalf of large global industry-leading corporations in the North American market. The expansion in offshore activities exerted downward pressure on the Group’s revenue growth over the year but had a positive impact on Group margin.In the fourth quarter alone  Core Services & D.I.B.S. revenue amounted to €2 042 million  representing a decline of -1.7% like-for-like excluding the Covid support contracts. In addition to the impact of slowing volumes in an uncertain economic environment  growth was held back by the highly volatile exchange rates in countries in hyperinflation.Reported growth stood at +11.6%  reflecting:(i) the positive impact from changes in the scope of consolidation  led by the inclusion of Majorel since November 1  2023;(ii) the unfavorable currency effect stemming from the decline against the euro in the US dollar  the Egyptian pound  the Colombian peso  the Indian rupee and most other operating currencies.* At constant scope of consolidation and exchange rates  excluding the impact of lower revenue from Covid support contracts and the adjustment for the impact of high volatility of exchange rates in countries with hyperinflationNorth America & Asia-PacificRegional revenue came to €2 534 million in 2023  down a slight -1.4% from the year before on a like-for-like basis. Reported revenue declined by -5.4% over the year  reflecting the unfavorable currency effect from the decline against the euro in the Indian rupee and  in the second half  the US dollar. In the final quarter  revenue amounted to €661 million  down -4.6% like-for-like and -9.7% as reported.The slight contraction in revenue over the year was attributable to corporate budget cuts in the United States and the post-Covid slowdown in volumes in the North American market  in such industries as telecommunications  technology  and retail. Growth was also dampened by the client project cancellations  as well as by program scale-backs and postponements.In this challenging environment  highly competitive offshore solutions enjoyed fast growth  particularly in India  although the resulting deflationary impact detracted from regional revenue.In the Asia-Pacific region  revenue growth was robust throughout the year  supported in particular by the ramp-up of new contracts in China in the financial services and travel verticals.Across the region as a whole  the content moderation (Trust & Safety)  back-office services and customer acquisition activities expanded at a steady pace over the year.LATAMIn 2023  revenue in the LATAM region amounted to €1 569 million  a year-on-year increase of +0.5% like-for-like. Growth was damped by the adjustment for the impact of high volatility of exchange rates in countries with hyperinflationary (Argentina). On a reported basis  growth was down -5.1%  primarily reflecting the decline in the Colombian and Argentine pesos against the euro.Fourth-quarter revenue stood at €390 million  a year-on-year decrease of -3.2% like-for-like and of -6.4% as reported. Adjusting for the impact of hyperinflation on activities in Argentina  following the change of government  weighed heavily on like-for-like growth at year-end.Over the full year  regional growth was supported by the robust momentum in the social media content moderation  financial services and healthcare verticals  attenuated by softer business in transportation services and retail.The LATAM region’s offshore activities were confronted with a slowdown in North American demand  particularly in the second half.Regional growth was also pulled down by the diminished appeal of Mexico  and more recently Colombia  compared with other offshoring locales following the strengthening of their currencies against the US dollar. Demand from North America & Asia-Pacific clients shifted favorably to the India-based offshore activities  but with a deflationary effect on consolidated revenue growth.Europe & MEA (EMEA)Regional revenue came to €2 536 million in 2023  representing a like-for-like increase of +8.0%  excluding the Covid support contracts. Growth was damped by the adjustment for the impact of high volatility of exchange rates in Turkey  which is a country with hyperinflation. In the fourth quarter alone  like-for-like growth excluding the impact of Covid support contracts came to +2.3%  with a slight dampening from adjustments for the impact of hyperinflation on activities in Turkey.Multilingual activities  which are the primary contributors to the region’s revenue stream and mainly serve large global industry-leading corporations  especially in the digital economy  reported sustained growth for the year. While particularly buoyant in Greece  Egypt and Turkey over the year  growth in multilingual hub activities slowed in the final quarter in Portugal  particularly in the social media vertical.Business in the United Kingdom rose sharply over the period  driven by the ramp-up of new contracts in financial services  with government agencies (excluding Covid support contracts) and in retail.Operations in Germany expanded at a satisfactory pace  thanks in particular to the fast growth in nearshore services in the Balkans and robust business development in the social media  travel and consumer electronics verticals.Specialized ServicesRevenue from Specialized Services stood at €1 363 million in 2023  a year-on-year increase of +16.1% like-for-like and of +17.0% as reported. The difference between like-for-like and reported growth rates reflected:(i) the positive impact of consolidating PSG Global Solutions from November 1  2022  and of Capita Translation & Interpreting from January 1  2023.(ii) the negative currency effect stemming from the decline in the US dollar against the euro.In the fourth quarter  revenue rose by +13.3% like-for-like  extending the robust gains reported in the first two quarters of the year.LanguageLine Solutions  the main contributor to Specialized Services revenue  continued to enjoy significant growth throughout the year. Its performance was led by market share gains in a fast-expanding industry  supported in particular by the ongoing development of video and telephone interpreting solutions and the growth in digital platforms.TLScontact’s activities continued to grow very rapidly over the year  driven by the still highly robust post-Covid rebound in the visa application management business  which is leveraging the favorable environment created by increased passenger traffic and the strong growth in premium ancillary services. As a result  revenue from these activities rose to a record high in 2023  well above pre-Covid levels.2023 RESULTSEBITDA before non-recurring items ended 2023 at €1 775 million  up +1.4% from the prior year and representing a margin of 21.3%  versus 21.5% in 2022.EBITA before non-recurring items was €1 290 million  vs. €1 262 million in 2022  for a margin of 15.5%  unchanged from the year before. It was shaped by:(i) two months of EBITA from Majorel  consolidated since November 1  2023  which corresponded to a EBITA margin before non-recurring items of 8.5%(ii) €13 million in streamlining costs already recognized in the first half to offset the impact of slowing volumes in an uncertain environment.Excluding the impact of consolidating Majorel over two months and adjusting for streamlining costs  Teleperformance’s underlying EBITA margin before non-recurring items would have been 15.9%  up +40 basis points compared with 2022.The improvement was primarily led by:(i) a positive mix effect from the fast growth in high-margin Specialized Services activities;(ii) the rapid expansion in offshoring activities in India;(iii) dedicated action plans and tight cost control.Operating earnings by activityEBITA before non-recurring items by activity€ millions 2023 2022 North America & Asia-Pacific 311 330 % of revenue 12.3% 12.3% LATAM 195 219 % of revenue 12.4% 13.3% Europe & MEA (EMEA) 255 271 % of revenue 10.1% 10.2% MAJOREL 29 0 % of revenue 8.5% N/A Holding company 91 70 CORE SERVICES & D.I.B.S. 881 890 % of revenue 12.6% 12.7% CORE SERVICES & D.I.B.S.

Excluding Majorel  EBITA margin before non-recurring items widened by 10 bps year-on-year  to 12.8%.North America & Asia-PacificEBITA before non-recurring items in the North America & Asia-Pacific region declined to €311 million from €330 million in 2022  while margin held firm at 12.3%.However  the India-based offshore activities serving the North American market continued to expand at a very good pace and generated high margins. This solution is ideally suited to clients seeking to optimize their cost structures as their volume growth slows.LATAMEBITA before non-recurring items in the LATAM region came to €195 million in 2023  versus €219 million the year before  while margin contracted to 12.4% from 13.3% in 2022. The erosion was caused by the slowdown in business growth in the region throughout the year  and more particularly in the second half. Unfavorable movements in the Colombian peso weighed on margins at year-end.Softer volumes in the North American market had a negative impact on the Group’s nearshore activities. Regional growth and margins were also impacted by the diminished appeal of Mexico-based nearshore activities after the Mexican peso strengthened against the US dollar.Europe & MEA (EMEA)EBITA before non-recurring items in the EMEA region came to €255 million in 2023  versus €271 million in 2022  yielding a margin of 10.1% versus 10.2% a year earlier. The firm margin performance reflects the solid upturn in the second half that  while primarily due to the favorable comparison with the prior-year period  effectively offset the margin decline in the first-half. In 2022  Covid support contracts in the Netherlands  the United Kingdom  France and Germany had substantially boosted the region’s margin until essentially the end of the first half.Majorel reported EBITA before non-recurring items of €29 million and a margin of 8.5% in the last two months of 2023. EBITA was reduced by the €10 million or so cost of the company’s efficiency measures.Specialized ServicesSpecialized Services reported EBITA before non-recurring items of €409 million in 2023  compared with €372 million in 2022  while the margin came to 30.0% versus 31.9% the year before.TLScontact sharply improved its operating margin year-on-year  which ended 2023 higher than before the emergence of the health crisis. This very good performance was led by the sustained strong recovery in the company's business volumes (especially in the first half)  the satisfactory growth in premium ancillary services and the implementation of cost-cutting measures during the crisis.LanguageLine Solutions' operating margin contracted year-on-year at a time of strong client demand and a shortage of interpreters in the United States  but conditions improved in the second half. The company’s business model remains robust and based on the sustained  structural growth in demand  primarily home-based interpreters  unrivaled technological capabilities and an industry leading sales and support processes.Other income statement itemsEBIT amounted to €1 011 million  versus €992 million in 2022. It included:(i) amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets in an amount of €141 million  versus €143 million in 2022;(ii) €105 million in accounting expenses relating to performance share plans  versus €113 million the year before.The financial result represented a net expense of €178 million  up from the €93 million net expense reported in 2022. The steep increase in finance costs was driven mainly by the new debt contracted to acquire Majorel in November 2023 and by the impact of rising interest rates on the variable portion of debt. Given the current environment  the 3.3% cost of debt is favorable for the Group.Income tax expense amounted to €231 million  down from €256 million the year before  and corresponded to a lower effective average tax rate of 27.7%  versus 28.5% in 2022.Net profit – Group share totaled €602 million  versus €643 million in 2022  while diluted earnings per share came to €10.18  compared with €10.77 a year earlier.The Board of Directors will recommend that shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on May 23  2024 approve a 2023 dividend of €3.85 per share  unchanged from the amount paid in respect of 2022. This would correspond to a payout ratio of 38%.Cash flows and financial structureNet free cash flow after lease expenses  interest and tax paid amounted to €812 million  versus €703 million the year before  representing an increase of +15.5%. The cash conversion ratio  as measured by net free cash flow divided by EBITDA before non-recurring items  rose to 45.7% from 39.7% in 2022.The change in consolidated working capital requirement over the year was an inflow of €24 million  marking a significant improvement on last year’s €172 million outflow thanks to the implementation of a stepped-up plan to track receivables.Net capital expenditure amounted to €212 million  or 2.5% of revenue  down from €297 million and 3.6% in 2022 due to more disciplined capital allocation in an uncertain market environment and the development of a worldwide hybrid model combining on-site services and work-from-home solutions (used by more than 40% of the workforce as of December 31  2023).Net debt stood at €4 553 million at December 31  2023  up sharply from €2 609 million a year earlier. The increase primarily reflected the new debt taken on to finance the Majorel acquisition and shareholder payments over the year  in the form of dividends (€227 million) and share buybacks (€366 million). As a result  the net debt-to-EBITDA ratio came to 2.56x  or to a pro forma 2.18x with Majorel consolidated over 12 months.The Group's liquidity improved during year following the refinancing transactions carried out in June 2023.2023 HIGHLIGHTSAcquisition of Majorel in November 2023: a new springboard to drive sustained growth in the years aheadTeleperformance announced the completion of the Majorel acquisition on November 8  2023  one month ahead of the initial schedule set when the acquisition was announced on April 26.The acquisition will enable Teleperformance to broaden its presence in Europe  such as in France and Germany  where the Group has a relatively small presence  and in a number of high-growth potential verticals  such as social media  luxury goods  automotive and travel  and in areas of high-value expertise  such as claim management and end-to-end documents processing.It is also strengthening Teleperformance's exposure to European clients  whereas its current client portfolio is mainly American.The combination will create a wide range of synergies  in terms of both revenue and costs. The cost synergy plan announced on April 26 is on track to deliver around €150 million in savings.Also as announced last April  the acquisition will be accretive to earnings per share before synergies from 2024.It has also strengthened Teleperformance’s global leadership  with the new combination representing nearly 500 000 employees around the world  €10.1 billion in revenue  and €2.1 billion in EBITDA (pro forma 2023 figures).AI developmentsGenerative artificial intelligence (or GenAI) represents a major opportunity to continue developing new  more effective hybrid solutions for clients  combining automation and employee expertise. In customer experience management  the deployment of this technology is still in its infancy and needs to be secured in terms of data confidentiality and response reliability. Long proficient in IVR  OCR  chatbot and other automation technologies  Teleperformance is also leveraging GenAI technology to accelerate the transformation of its own operations  particularly in hiring and training.The Group is currently working in close partnership with its clients on more than 250 AI-projects including projects with Gen-AI  in various stages of development.In 2023  Teleperformance was especially active in expanding its portfolio of high-performance hybrid solutions  through partnerships with global artificial intelligence leaders:- Using the ServiceNow cloud platform to deploy AI solutions. The platform’s single simplified knowledge management system and ability to automate certain tasks is enabling Teleperformance to enhance the employee experience  increase productivity and transform its operations.- Expanding its partnership with Microsoft with the launch of TP GenAI  a generative artificial intelligence platform. Teleperformance will leverage the Microsoft Azure suite of artificial intelligence tools to deliver an enhanced customer experience.Following the acquisition of Majorel  Teleperformance announced the launch of TP Infinity  its new global digital consulting arm designed to offer clients a holistic approach to building stronger brands through an enhanced customer experience. TP Infinity is comprised of a diverse team of more than 650 data lovers  tech enthusiasts  creative masterminds and operations gurus operating in 15 countries across North America  South America  Europe  and Asia who are united by a common purpose: to push the boundaries of the customer experience.Joao Cardoso is joining Teleperformance’s executive committee as Chief innovation and digital officer. This tenured Teleperformance’s leader is an engineer in computer sciences specialized in formal language and AI. He has been the main architect of “TP Cloud Campus”  the remote management platform that enabled the Group to successfully address the Covid confinement challenges.Sustainable long-term growthIn 2023  Teleperformance pursued its sustainable long-term growth by creating new jobs around the world in a workplace environment of excellence and employee well-being. This growth has also been gentle on the environment  with the achievement of demanding targets. In this way  the Group has continued to successfully implement its corporate social responsibility roadmap  which is based on robust commitments  such as:Employee well-being  safety and diversityIn 2023  Teleperformance was named one of the top five World’s Best Workplaces™ 2023 by Fortune and Great Place to Work®. For the third year in a row  Teleperformance was ranked among the 25 global leaders  moving up from 25th place in 2021. Teleperformance is certified as a Great Place to Work® in 72 countries  covering more than 99% of its workforce  in a compelling demonstration of the very strong trust and engagement felt by employees towards their company.Teleperformance’s commitment to diversity  equity and inclusion is deeply embedded in its DNA. The Group maintained gender parity in 2023  when women accounted for 53.7% of the workforce. It also significantly increased the proportion of women in management positions  to 51.9% in 2023 from 47.8% in 2022. During the year  Teleperformance implemented the global agreement signed in December 2022 with the UNI Global Union  which now covers five new countries – Colombia  Romania  Poland  Jamaica and El Salvador. The agreement is designed to strengthen workers’ rights to form trade unions and engage in collective bargaining  while improving workplace health and safety.Acting as an engaged corporate citizen and environmental steward  contributing to job creation and the local economy:Teleperformance is committed to deepening its positive impact on local economies  by providing stable jobs  a living wage  training and career opportunities  as well as an inclusive working environment aligned with the highest market standards. In particular  the Group is helping to broaden young people’s access to jobs  increase women's employment and expand the middle class in developing nations  where 70% of its employees work. In 2023  Teleperformance hired 96 500 new employees for their first job experience  enabling a wide variety of talented people around the world to enter the workplace.As a concerned environmental steward  in 2023 the Group reduced its carbon emissions by -34% in absolute terms and by -47% per employee compared with the 2019 baseline. Energy from renewable sources rose to 34.7% of total energy used during the year from 11% in 2019. To move to the next level  the Group is developing its 2030 targets with a pathway consistent with a less than 1.5°C warming scenario.€500 million share buyback programOn August 2  2023  Teleperformance launched a share buyback program for a total amount of up to €500 million. Most of the acquired shares will be canceled. The opportunity to initiate the buyback program arose from the Group’s strong cash flow generation  its unrivaled  industry-leading performance in a challenging macroeconomic environment  and its future growth prospects  all of which were not properly reflected in its current stock price.The buyback program will be rewarding for Teleperformance’s long-term shareholders  without impacting the Group’s BBB credit rating from S&P or its ability to seize acquisition opportunities.A total of €366 million in shares have been bought back in 2023. The Group does not rule out launching new programs in the future should the stock price continue to undervalue the strength of the Group’s business model.Following the acquisition of Majorel and completion of the €500 million share buyback program  Teleperformance’s financial flexibility remains fully intact  with an investment capacity of around €1 billion.New governance structure and preparation for the separation of the roles of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer on January 1  2026On February 15  2024  the Board of Directors unanimously approved the new Group governance structure for the period ending December 31  2025  with Daniel Julien  founder and Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  and Bhupender Singh  Deputy Chief Executive Officer and Director  acting as co-Chief Executive Officers. They will jointly make strategic decisions while sharing operational responsibilities  following an agile and coordinated management strategy.The Board believes the new governance to be particularly well-aligned with the Group’s current challenges  notably the successful integration of Majorel and the optimization of opportunities offered by artificial intelligence. It also represents a step towards the separation of the roles of Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer on January 1  2026  when Mr. Singh will be appointed as sole Chief Executive Officer.OUTLOOKIn 2024  Teleperformance is taking a conservative approach and adapting its growth model to the volatile economic environment. This process is reflected in its full-year financial targets:Like-for-like revenue growth* of +2% to +4%EBITA margin before non-recurring items up between 10bps and 20bps on a pro forma basis (vs. 14.9% in 2023) excl. Majorel integration costsIncrease in net free cash flow and ongoing cash return to shareholders  up to 2/3 of the net free cash flow  resulting from dividends and share buy-backsA robust balance sheet  with leverage of less than 2x EBITDA(4)Revenue growth is likely to remain limited in the first quarter of 2024  given the highly unfavorable comparatives and the persistently volatile environment.Over the medium term  Teleperformance intends to drive consistently industry-outperforming growth and further margin improvement*.* On a pro forma 2023 basis including Majorel over 12 months---------------------------DisclaimerAll forward-looking statements are based on Teleperformance management’s present expectations of future events and are subject to a number of factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements.

With that  I will now turn the call over to Olivier.Olivier Taelman: Thank you  Mikaela. Good afternoon  and good evening  everyone  and thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter and financial year of 2023 earnings call. I would like to open with our 2023 accomplishments that have strengthened our confidence for a transformational 2024. Clinically  we completed enrollment in our DREAM U.S. pivotal study in March and initiated enrollment in our excess complete concentric collapse U.S. pivotal study. From a regulatory perspective  we filed the first three modules in the model of PMA submission. The fourth and final module will contain the DREAM safety and efficacy data. Commercially  we reported 2023 sales of €4.3 million  an increase of 43% from 2022  benefiting from our direct-to-consumer initiatives launched early in the year. We also initiated a partnership with ResMed Germany to further increase overall OSA therapy penetration  ensuring that patients have access to the right treatment. Finally  we continued building our U.S. leadership team  strengthening our U.S. presence. Looking ahead 2024 is set to be the most exciting year in company's history. By early April  we expect to report safety and efficacy results from the DREAM study. Our confidence in DREAM outcomes is supported not only by roughly 500 commercial and clinical Genio implants globally  but also by DREAM efficacy and safety data released in a late breaking poster session at SLEEP 2023 in June. In this poster  we reported efficacy data on the first 34 DREAM patients reaching 12-month follow-up  which demonstrated a 65% AHI responder rate  a 76 ODI responder rate  and safety data on all 115 patients enrolled in the study that was in line with expectations. As a reminder  for the trial to be successful  of the 115 patients  at least 62.6% need to be AHI and ODI responders at 12-month follow-up. We anticipate submitting the fourth and final module in our modular PMA filing  which will include DREAM 12-month safety and efficacy data during the second quarter this year. We are preparing for a launch by the end of 2024 as based upon modular PMA review cycle times. We anticipate FDA approval in late 2024 or early 2025 as we do not control FDA timelines. To ensure  we are fully prepared at launch  we are accelerating investments in our U.S. commercial team. We anticipate having the commercial U.S. leadership onboarded by mid-year and bringing on our sales force  patient management teams  and reimbursement specialists during the second half of 2024. The current hypoglossal nerve stimulation market in the U.S. is very concentrated  allowing for a focused launch strategy on high volume sites complemented by robust prior authorization and patient care teams. A streamlined patient referral pathway from SLEEP specialists to these sites will accelerate market growth. A key differentiator of bilateral stimulation to unilateral stimulation is the ability to treat complete concentric collapse of CCC patients. The U.S. ACCESS pivotal study continues to enroll. As a reminder  CCC patients represent approximately 30% of hypoglossal nerve stimulation eligible to treat OSA patients who are contraindicated to commercially available AG&S therapy in the U.S. and do not have suitable treatment options other than major pallet surgery. In the BETTER SLEEP study  we demonstrated bilateral stimulation can treat CCC patients  which led to a complete concentric collapse label expansion in Europe. Recently  Genio's success in treating CCC patients commercially was demonstrated in a real world case series that showed an average Apnea-Hypopnea Index decrease of 73%. The excess primary endpoints are similar to DREAM  with the objective to expand our U.S. labeling to include complete concentric collapse indication and eliminate the need to perform a drug induced SLEEP endoscopy to determine whether a patient has CCC or not. Commercially  the fourth quarter was very strong with sales of €1.8 million showing 87% sequential and 42% year-over-year growth. This is a result of both strong underlying demand for Genio and recent commercial investments including direct-to-consumer online campaigns and a patient top-line. Continued investing in understanding the patient's journey resulted in the launch of a patient helpline and kicking off a ResMed Germany collaboration to ensure every patient gets the most appropriate OSA treatment. This is not only resulting in educating folks by calling the outline  but can be considered a key pillar in our fourth quarter success together with the strong growth of sales and commercial team in Germany is doing. In 2024  the recent ResMed Germany collaboration will further expand the OSA continuum of care  guiding patients to the appropriate therapy. For CPAP quitting patients suffering from moderate to severe OSA  Genio is a solution and for untreated patients CPAP remains the golden standard. We continue to position ourselves as an innovation leader in the obstructive sleep apnea space with always putting patients first and listening to our surgeons. As a result  Genio is a different approach to hypoglossal nerve stimulation with its lead and tough solution. Genio offers patients a leafless full body MRI compatible non-implanted battery solution powered and controlled by a wearable. Thanks to the fully upgradable wearable component  Genio patients can always have access to the most advanced technology without needing another surgery. The recently launched Genio 2.1 enables greater stimulation adjustability and gives patients the autonomy to adjust stimulation amplitude within predefined boundaries. This will definitely help patients that are very sensitive to neurostimulation overall. While the Genio 3.1 implantable stimulator is under regulatory review and will further support or implant for life concept. Future generations of the Genio system will have a more agronomic wearable component [indiscernible] that will adjust stimulation based on sleeping position and provide patients with real time feedback through data collection that will improve the patient experience. We are making strong progress towards our key objectives for 2024  which are to complete patient follow-up in the DREAM U.S. pivotal study and report efficacy and safety data by early April. File the fourth and final module on the model of PMA submission  complete patient enrollment in ACCESS U.S. pivotal study  continue preparations to enter the U.S. market with regulatory  manufacturing and market access readiness and drive further revenue growth in Germany while opening new European markets. With that  I'm pleased to turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer  Loïc Moreau who will provide a financial update.Loïc Moreau: Thank you  Olivier. Good day to everyone and thank you for joining us today. Revenue for the fourth quarter ended December 31  2023  was €1.8 million  a 42% increase over the fourth quarter of 2022 and an 87% increase over the third quarter of 2023. I would like to point out that the fourth quarters benefit the most from seasonality and while we expect a strong year-over-year growth in the first quarter  we anticipate sales to be down sequentially. Total operating loss for the fourth quarter was €10.8 million versus €9.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2022  driven by an acceleration in clinical activities as well as commercial investments in Europe as well as U.S. As of December 31  2023  cash and financial assets totaled €58 million compared to €95 million on December 31  2022. During the fourth quarter  our monthly cash burn was €4.9 million  a slight increase from 3Q driven by U.S. commercialization preparation activities. Based on our current cash position  we have runway into late 2024. With that  I will turn the call back over to Olivier.Olivier Taelman: Thank you  Loïc. As I hope you all agree  we are entering the most exciting time in Nyxoah's history. We are a few weeks away from DREAM clinical data readout  which if positive  should result in obtaining FDA approval in late 2024 or early 2025  depending upon FDA timeline. I look really forward to accelerating investments in the U.S. commercial organization  so we will be ready for the late 2024 launch and continued sales growth in Europe. This concludes the formal part of our presentation. Operator  I will turn the call over to you to begin our Q&A session.Operator: Thank you so much. [Operator Instructions]. One moment for our first question. That is from Jon Block with Stifel. Please proceed.Jon Block: Great. Thanks guys. Good afternoon. I'll start the 4Q 2023 top line was certainly solid. I think ahead of most prior estimates and certainly ahead of hours. Olivier  maybe if you could just talk about what was that strength attributable to? Was it the DTC? Was it the ResMed partnership? I think there was a competitor that had some lead issues in Germany  pardon me. So maybe if you could just talk about the main drivers or even rank order them if you can  that'd be helpful as we think about our models.Olivier Taelman: So thank you  Jon. Thank you for the question. And I can only agree  I think we can say that the fourth quarter was a very strong quarter in Germany. We estimate also that we have nearly took 50% of the German market share in the fourth quarter. Now  the drivers  I think first of all  it's a confirmation that there is a high acceptance from our German physicians. That is one thing. Second  we have the 48 centers that are now fully trained and also implanting. We are offering doctors a patient  a choice in the hypoglossal nerve stimulation implants  and stepping away from an invasive pacemaker solution into a single incision procedure. This is definitely helping. Further  there is the product differentiation  putting patients at the center. And of course  there is the sleep physician focus through DTC. I think those components are really driving our Q4 strong results.Jon Block: Perfect. Great. That was very helpful. And maybe just to pivot for the second question  you touched on some of the next steps for U.S. approval and then commercialization. Maybe just to probe a little bit more  can you comment on the status of  call it the first three modules  right  that have already been submitted. And then  is there anything new or incremental when we start thinking about the reimbursement path and which road you're going to go down? Thanks for your time guys.Olivier Taelman: Yes. As you mentioned correctly  in total there are four modules. We have submitted the first three modules already. The fourth and final module will contain the transformed DREAM safety and efficacy data and will be filed shortly in the second quarter. So the first three are done  the fourth will go hand in hand with the DREAM safety data. Now when we are coming to our further market access strategy  because I think that was also part of the question. Currently  we have a team in place that is working to secure reimbursement from both CMS and the commercial payers. That team will also work with customers through the prior authorization process when we launch in the U.S. We are currently also in close conversations at the AAO who will make a recommendation on CPP codes to AMA. There are a few different strategies. One would be using -- another one would be using an existing neuromodulation code that covers off technology very well. But I think most important is that the reimbursement in both scenarios will be in line with current AG&S payment rates. So I hope that is providing your answer  Jon.Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question  please. And it's from the line of Ed White with H.C. Wainwright. Please proceed.Ed White: Hello  thanks for taking my questions. Perhaps if you could just quantify  if you can the impact of seasonality in the first quarter of this year that you're expecting.Olivier Taelman: Thank you  Ed  for this question. And I think the best place person to answer this is our CFO. So I'll hand it off to you.Loïc Moreau: Thank you. Thank you  Olivier  and thanks for the question  Ed. So  as you are aware  the fourth quarter seasonality is driven by the phasing of hospital budgets and spending in Germany. And as you know  we do not provide revenue guidance. But last year  if you observe  the German AG&S market declined approximately 25% from the fourth quarter 2022 to the first quarter 2023  and we would anticipate a similar seasonality in the first quarter 2024. Given we still have high customer concentration  the impact of seasonality on our first quarter could be more pronounced. That's what we anticipate.Ed White: Okay. Thank you. And also  just to clarify  are essentially all of your sales right now coming from Germany? Is there a number you can use to quantify that?Olivier Taelman: 90% of our sales in Europe are currently in Germany.Ed White: Okay. Great. Thank you. And my last question is just on the ResMed  how should we be thinking about the ResMed impact on sales so far? What are you seeing? Is there any way to determine if it's having an impact already or if it should be a later in 2024 event? And also  is there the possibility of a ResMed agreement in the U.S. as well?Loïc Moreau: So thank you again for this question. Olivier again  I will answer this in fact these two questions. So first of all  in ResMed Germany collaboration  we announced the collaboration end of September 2023. We do not expect to see an impact for the first six months. So we are anticipating beginning to realize benefits in the second quarter this year. That is  I think  the answer on the first part. Now the second  do you anticipate also partnering with ResMed in the U.S.? Our strategy is to go direct in the U.S. If there are opportunities to augment direct approach with partnerships like with ResMed touching on their relationship and tapping over their relationships with key physicians  we will definitely explore those in going forward.Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question  please. And it's from the line of Ross Osborn with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please proceed.Ross Osborn: Hey guys  congrats on progress. Thanks for taking our questions. So  starting off just on the U.S. market  would you walk us through how you're thinking about initially commercializing Genio in terms of targeting existing inspire users versus growing the market? Or in other words  getting first time HGNS users to adopt Genio?Olivier Taelman: Thank you  Ross  for the question. I mean  we are thinking and we are preparing a lot of different strategies on this point  but I can really be precise in the answer. So the U.S. market today is very concentrated. We plan a targeted launch focused on top accounts  which constitute over 85% of current HGNS sales in the U.S. We will have a dedicated sales force sized appropriately for a targeted launch. There will be targeted DTC focus on product differentiation and patient referral pathway. I think this will be a main differentiator to what is happening today. It will be really a targeted DTC focus. We will be engaging with sleep specialists  enabling a steady stream of patient referrals  scalable patient follow-up strategy and sales  marketing and private authorization teams ahead of launch  and more details I'm really happy to share later this year.Ross Osborn: Okay. Great. And then maybe one more qualifying question on the ResMed partnership. Would you just remind us why they are incentivized to market Genio?Olivier Taelman: Yes. So in fact  I -- first of all  I would like to maybe -- partnership because through this partnership  we really aim both ResMed and Nyxoah and our patient centric approach  developing a complete OSA ecosystem where patients can be guided to whichever OSA treatment best suits their needs. We will collaborate on DTC initiatives  sales and marketing efforts to target both sleep physicians and ENT surgeons. And I think the goal of this partnership or to expand OSA therapy penetration and increase of market share. Now what are the benefits? I think for Nyxoah  it's pretty obvious that having access to patients who are quitting CPAP that can be offered Genio  this will drive share gains and strengthen our relationship with sleep specialists. For ResMed  benefit from having access to more OSA patients through the ENT surgeons that we are having at Nyxoah also or helpline and increasing sleep specialist capacity by sending CPAP struggling patients who are time consuming to Genio. I think something also not to neglect is the healthcare system benefit  as untreated OSA patients are at high cost  ensuring these patients are optimally treated either with CPAP or with Genio will definitely have a positive impact on reducing healthcare spendings. And overall  this partnership will also increase OSA therapy penetration and will benefit patients.Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question  please. And it's from the line of David Rescott with Baird. Please proceed.David Rescott: Great. Thanks for taking the questions. I know you touched a little bit on the reimbursement landscape in the U.S. again  I know you mentioned that September of last year at AAO there was some discussions around new codes. Can you remind us what specifically are the next steps as you look out over the next several quarters or so around what we'll find out and when we're going to kind of find that update out around what a U.S. reimbursement code would look?Olivier Taelman: Yes. No  no  definitely. So the next step will be very precise that the AAO will make a recommendation on CPT code to AMA. So from our side  we are working immediately to secure reimbursement from both CMS once we have FDA approval  so that we can immediately start commercializing. And in parallel  of course  preparing also commercial payers and educate and train them on products can also convince them to start reimbursing our technology. Now  our competitor  as you know has done a terrific job educating the commercial payers about the benefits of HGNS resulting in all having HGNS coverage policies. We have already engaged in an informal discussion with the payers and expect those policies. At launch  very precise  we anticipate being reimbursed to prior authorizations and would expect to be included in coverage policies with commercial payers within 12 months afterwards.David Rescott: Okay. And then  you mentioned some investments in the sales force ahead of the U.S. launch. I heard you also mention some investments in manufacturing. I'm curious what specifically is going on from the manufacturing side? And historically I think you talked about this $4 million of quarterly cash burn. Is that kind of the right way to think about that into 2024? Or should there be some type of acceleration assuming that you continue to invest in some of the sales force and manufacturing capabilities ahead of a U.S. launch? Thank you.Olivier Taelman: Yes. So  first part is on the manufacturing side  we really invested heavily. So we have now a complete approved site in Belgium manufacturing our products. And next to this  we are working with a service provider in the U.S. that will also manufacturing or will also manufacture our products. So with both sides  we do believe that we totally or completely have de-risked the manufacturing volume capacity  that we will be able to start building inventory before launch. So that at all time when we launch  we will have significant inventory in our possession that there will never be a product shortage in the first 12 months of launch. That is one thing. When it comes to the cost relating to this and the overall spend  Loïc  I'm sure that you would like to comment on this a little bit further.Loïc Moreau: So you have seen that we burnt €4.9 million in the last quarter of 2023. When we look forward  we expect the burn rate to remain steady for the first half of the year  while we are in fact doing our pre-commercial investments and then when we starting this summer  we expect this burn rate to accelerate as we see more and more investments in U.S. commercialization activities.Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question  please. And it's from the line of Adam Maeder with Piper Sandler. Please proceed.Adam Maeder: Hi  good afternoon. Congrats on the nice finish for the year and the recent progress. And thank you for taking the questions. I wanted to start on the DREAM study and just the disclosure strategy around full DREAM results. So I heard the data should be communicated by early April. Olivier  are you able to talk a little bit more about exactly what's going to be shared at that point in time? Is it simply the top-line information? Will we get additional details? I'm assuming it's going to be messaged in the form of a press release  but maybe just talk about disclosure strategy. And then I have a follow-up. Thank you.Olivier Taelman: So thank you  Adam  for the question. So as I mentioned  and we will communicate latest beginning of April  the data that will be in a press release followed also by a call. We will be focused on top-line results  AHI reduction  responder rate  ODI reduction. And then we are planning and moving forward to reveal all the data in detail during the ISSS conference in September  where we will have PI talking to the data and the details. So what you can expect is top-line data being released in a press release  followed also by call where there can be more questions and we will be focusing on  in fact  responder rate  AHI reduction  ODI reduction  we will also talk high-level on the safety data that we are having. And then of course  in parallel  we are preparing everything for a publication in a Tier 1 journal.Adam Maeder: That's perfect. Thank you for the color  Olivier. And then for the follow-up  I wanted to ask about the ACCESS study. I think it was mentioned in the prepared remarks  but was hoping just to get a little bit more granular in terms of enrollment progress in that study. How should we think about potential timelines for enrollment completion and ultimately potential FDA commercial approval for CCC patients? Thanks for taking the questions.Olivier Taelman: Okay. So  we continue to make progress with the study. We will not disclose the number of patients implanted already  but that being said  we still continue to plan to close all implants by the end of 2024. Then there is a 12-month patient follow-up. So that brings us to the end of 2025. And then the aim is to submit the CCC data as a PMA supplement that should take maximum six to nine-month review period. So we plan to have the label expansion assuming all data are positive mid-2026.Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question  please. And it's from the line of Laura Roba with Degroof Petercam. Please proceed.Laura Roba: Hi  thank you for taking my questions. We see that gross margin was lower in Q4. Could you elaborate a bit on that and on what we could expect for 2024?Olivier Taelman: Definitely  and this is definitely a question for our CFO.Loïc Moreau: Thank you. Thank you  Laura. Yes  indeed. We were at 60% in Q4 versus 62% for the rest of the year. Actually  this is explained by our scale and specifically the fact that we have a newly opened manufacturing site in Belgium that is not yet at full capacity. So we see some modest variability quarter-over-quarter. That said  we anticipate the gross margin to increase over the coming quarters as we scale up volumes. Over time  we expect our gross margin to eventually approximate the level of other neural stimulation companies and to be above 80%.Operator: Thank you so much. And one moment for our next question  please. All right. And our last question will be from Suraj Kalia with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead.Suraj Kalia: Olivier and Loïc  can you hear me all right?Olivier Taelman: Yes  we can.LoïcMoreau: Yes.Olivier Taelman: Hello.Suraj Kalia: Pardon the background noise  and congrats on the progress. So Olivier  a few questions from my side as we look forward to DREAM  Olivier  what would you say in your position say the results are -- how do you characterize the delta between bilateral versus unilateral. What would make you say these results are better than unilateral? What would make you say these are somewhat less than unilateral?Olivier Taelman: So if I understand the question correct Suraj  because there is a little bit background. So you're asking the results  comparison between bilateral result and unilateral result that we are seeing; is this correct?Suraj Kalia: Yes. I guess what I'm trying to understand  Olivier is  you can rest assured the numbers are going to be sliced and diced 10 different ways to make different arguments  right? I guess what I'm trying to understand is hypothetically; if you have 50% responder rate in the complete cohort inspire had a certain responder rate. We can slice and dice different metrics. What would make you say  you know what the totality of these results show bilateral is better than unilateral? What would make you somewhat cautious and say  you know what  we missed somewhere versus unilateral?Olivier Taelman: Yes. So first of all  I have to point out that the study was not designed to show superiority and it was even not a head-to-head trial. But on the other hand  you are look at those patients phenotyping. We look at the inclusion criteria; we look at the BMI criteria. So the studies are really similar or comparable. Now  what would we expect? So if we can show  and that's what we already communicated. First of all  of course  reaching the primary endpoint. Second  showing equivalent compared to the unilateral stimulation for non-CCC patients. I think that would be already a first accomplishment. When you look at what the respond rate would mean. In our case  we are forward and we have to show responder rate of 62.6%. So I would like to see numbers  of course  above. That is one thing. And then second  there will also be a lot of analysis that will be done on AHI reduction. What is the AHI reduction for patients with a higher BMI for patients with a BMI that is  for example  25 and then going lower. So I think this is really important. Let's also not forget the ODI reduction because there is also direct oxygen desaturation and the mortality risk. So I think this is important. And of course  all reductions have to meet the clinically  have to be clinically relevant. So that's what we are looking at. So equivalent that's what we would like to claim. We would further slice and dice the data and looking on AHI reductions. There is also the supine position that we are seeing and how the reduction is this because during a night patients  they tend not to stay only in one position  but to toss and turn a little bit. So also there we will come with a sub analysis. That's what you can expect from our data.Suraj Kalia: Got it. And Olivier  I'll quickly with my follow-up question and avoid the background noise. So Olivier  do you expect Genio eventually to be used in patients who are unwilling to try CPAP? And also  what has been the experience in Germany? Are they more female gender usage is higher than male just given beard issues? Thank you for taking my questions.Olivier Taelman: So first of all  we have to follow the current guidelines. And that means that patients need to be refractory of quitting CPAP. So that is one thing. So will we become first line? I think in order to do this; HGNS needs to change those guidelines. But for now it's clear that patients have to have CPAP before they become eligible for an HGNS treatment. So when it comes to the gender of patients  so also there we still see that the majority of patients are male and not female. And when it comes to the fact what you are alluding [Technical Difficulty] we also there we can confirm that patients who are suffering from modern or severe OSA and offer the Genio solutions are really happy to save  if I can say it like this  so that they can really benefit from our technology and from the bilateral stimulation as it is recommended by their surgeon and physician. So I hope that this is answering your question.Operator: Thank you. And with that  ladies and gentlemen  we conclude our Q&A and program for today. Thank you all for participating. And you may now disconnect.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

The firm’s closed-end funds deployed €5.9bn in 2023  with an acceleration in the second half of the year  driven by private debt and megatrend investing and a continued focus on downside protection. Investment teams remained laser-focused on selectivity  as evidenced by an exclusion rate maintained at a high level  reaching 98% in 2023 (vs. 97% in 2022). At 31 December 2023  the funds managed by Tikehau Capital had €6.9bn of dry powder 9 (+13% compared to 31 December 2022)  allowing them to capture attractive investment opportunities.was healthy while remaining particularly selective. The firm’s closed-end funds deployed in 2023  with an acceleration in the second half of the year  driven by private debt and megatrend investing and a continued focus on downside protection.Realizations within the firm’s closed-end funds amounted to €2.4bn 10   a 33% year-over-year growth  reflecting the firm’s solid market positioning. Fund performance was robust across asset classes  reflecting the quality and defensiveness of the firm’s portfolios of companies and assets. Levels of leverage remained limited for portfolio companies within the firm’s Direct Lending strategies and across the firm’s Real Estate strategies with weighted average net leverage ratio of 4.4x 11 at closing and average loan-to-value levels standing at around 24% 12 respectively. Portfolios of Real Estate assets remained highly granular with a balanced and diversified exposure to underlying sectors and geographies while maintaining a high level of financial occupancy rate of around 95% across Real Estate strategies. Companies within the firm’s Private Equity strategies continued to generate solid revenue and profitability growth and recorded  on average over the last 12 months  revenue growth of 22% and EBITDA growth of 23%.within the firm’s closed-end funds amounted to   a 33% year-over-year growth  reflecting the firm’s solid market positioning. Fund performance was robust across asset classes  reflecting the quality and defensiveness of the firm’s portfolios of companies and assets.Tikehau Capital recorded an unprecedented level of client demand  reflecting the firm’s robust commercial activity driven by its multi-local and diversified platform. The firm attracted record levels of gross and net inflows for its Asset Management business reaching €8.8bn of gross new money and €6.5bn of net new money  a 37% growth compared to the average 2017-22 level. The firm continued to successfully carry out the diversification of capital formation across:an demand  reflecting the firm’s robust commercial activity driven by its multi-local and diversified platform.− Asset classes  with a combination of flagship strategies as well as adjacencies and innovations.Tikehau Capital saw solid development for its Yield strategies across fund types and expertise  driven by Direct Lending  Credit Secondaries  CLOs  fixed income and dated funds as well as the launch of a Real Estate Credit strategy  in partnership with Altarea.

In addition  in December 2023  Tikehau Capital announced having entered into advanced discussion in Japan with Nikko Asset Management14  one of Asia’s largest asset managers  with a view to forming a business and capital alliance. In February 2024  Tikehau Capital announced a regional partnership with UOB-Kay Hian15  the Singapore-based largest stockbroker in Southeast Asia  to jointly launch an Asia Pacific Credit strategy to tap Asia’s fast-growing private credit market. Both strategic collaborations reflect Tikehau Capital’s strategy to continue to expand its global footprint  particularly across Asia  deepening its presence in a region where it has 10 years of operating history and addressing underpenetrated markets. The opening of an office in Hong-Kong is considered as a next step to allow the firm to expand its local presence and build new institutional client relationships in the region.In North America  six years after establishing a presence in New York and having launched four complementary strategies  Tikehau Capital is opening its 16th office in Montreal  to continue to build its strong local presence in Québec and accelerated its expansion in Canada.In 2023  the firm continued to reinforce its presence in the MENA region with  in particular  the opening of an office in Abu Dhabi.

In Israel  the firm benefits from a blue-chip institutional investor base  with cross asset class fundraising capabilities. Since inception in 2021  the Tel Aviv office attracted c. €1bn of AuM from Israeli investors.− Client types  with additional progress in democratizing private markets with strategic partners.The firm’s private debt unit-linked products launched with MACSF  Société Générale Assurances and Suravenir continued to benefit from robust momentum and attracted c. €1bn since inception and approximately €450m of inflows in 2023.With the objective to further address private investors’ demand to access private markets  Tikehau Capital launched in Q4 2023 a Private Equity fund of funds providing private wealth investors and high-net worth individuals with the opportunity to invest in the firm’s Private Equity strategies and its ecosystem. This new initiative aims for €400m of total commitments.Private investors accounted for 29% of net inflows16 in 2023 and 27% of Asset Management AuM at 31 December 2023.In 2023  Tikehau Capital continued to use its flexible and compounding balance sheet to support the expansion of its Asset Management activity while ensuring alignment of interests with its shareholders and LPs. In particular  initial commitments from the firm’s balance sheet allowed Tikehau Capital to:Launch strategic adjacencies (Real Estate Credit) and new initiatives (Private Equity fund of funds);(Real Estate Credit) and (Private Equity fund of funds); Launch new vintages of more established and scaling strategies (such as Direct Lending  Cybersecurity  Decarbonization  Credit Secondaries and CLOs).In addition  the firm’s balance sheet played a facilitating role in executing milestone transactions  particularly within the credit secondaries space  leading to the successful onboarding of its second Chinese LP for an investment totaling c.$100m in 2023.At 31 December 2023  Tikehau Capital’s balance sheet investment portfolio reached €3.9bn  compared to €3.5bn at 31 December 2022. The firm’s investment portfolio is primarily comprised of investments in the Asset Management strategies developed and managed by the firm for €3.1bn (79% of total portfolio17)  generating a high alignment of interests with its investor-clients. 21% of the portfolio or €0.9bn  is invested in ecosystem and direct investments  notably direct private equity investments  co-investments or investments in third-party funds  complementary to the Group’s asset management strategies. These investments aim at generating strong returns for the firm while serving its asset management franchise globally.Tikehau Capital’s investment portfolio benefits from a high level of diversification and granularity with more than 300 investments spread across several industry sectors and geographies  thus complementing the firm’s Asset Management activity exposure. On top of generating continued alignment of interests with investor-clients  the firm’s investment portfolio also allows the firm to foster opportunities and long-term relationships with partners.CONTINUED ACHIEVEMENTS ON SUSTAINABILITYFollowing its commitment set in 2021 to support the goal of achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 or sooner  in line with global efforts to limit global warming to 1.5°C  Tikehau Capital finalized its Net Zero Asset Manager targets in March 2023. The firm has made an initial commitment to manage close to 40% of its AuM in line with this net zero goal. For Real Estate assets  the Group aims at improving energy and carbon intensity  with a focus on its assets in France. With regards to Private Equity  Private Debt and Capital Markets Strategies  the commitment involves financing companies that are setting decarbonization commitments and making progress towards their low-carbon transition. The proportion of AuM to be managed in line with net zero is intended to increase over time as new funds are launched with net zero strategies.In addition  Tikehau Capital has been actively developing dedicated sustainability-themed and impact strategies to finance companies contributing to address key structural issues such as decarbonization  nature & biodiversity  cyber security and resilience. At 31 December 2023  the AuM for Tikehau Capital's sustainability-themed and impact platform dedicated to investments in companies amounted to €4.3bn  of which €3.0bn was specifically allocated to climate and biodiversity to enable transition at scale. This puts Tikehau Capital on track to reach its target of exceeding €5bn by 2025. Additionally  over the past two years  the firm's real estate investment and ESG teams collaborated closely to launch and fortify a platform  amounting to €7.4bn in funds earmarked for sustainable cities.FINANCIAL REVIEWContinued increase in Fee-paying AuM  securing recurring long-term management fee generation Management fees 18 reached €312m in 2023   up 6% compared to 2022  driven by the continued progression in fee-paying AuM in 2023. Fee-paying AuM amounted to €34.9bn at 31 December 2023  up 11% year-over-year  notably driven by Private Debt funds which have been particularly dynamic in both fundraising and deployment in Direct Lending  CLOs and Secondaries strategies  as well as inflows for Private Equity funds and Capital Markets Strategies. Average management fee rate stood at 0.94% in 2023  a slight decrease compared to 2022 (-0.04%)  reflecting fundraising mix as well as calendar effects. Performance-related revenues amounted to €10m in 2023 . They include various contributions from several historical mid-sized private equity and private debt vehicles  as well as first contributions from the firm’s third vintage of Direct Lending strategy (€4m).Performance-related revenues represent a significant value-creation driver embedded in Tikehau Capital’s operating model with  at 31 December 2023  €19.6bn of AuM eligible to carried interest . This profit engine is not yet fully crystallized in its financial statements  given the firm’s conservative accounting policy. The Group’s funds have provisioned approximately €180m 19 of carried interest . This amount only reflects a portion of the long-term value creation potential linked to this type of revenue and will increase as the funds approach their maturity and crystallize performance.As a result  asset management revenue increased by 6%  reaching €322m in 2023.Operating leverage ramped up in 2023 driven by scalability and disciplined cost management Asset management operating expenses 20 amounted to €189m in 2023  up 2% compared to 2022  with personnel expenses accounting for c.70% of operating expenses. This modest growth reflects selective investments carried out by the firm in 2023 to strengthen its asset management teams and its multi-local platform as well as the launch of initiatives to support future growth  coupled with efficient cost management. Core Fee-Related Earnings 21 (Core FRE) amounted to €123m in 2023   up 13% compared to 2022  mainly driven by management fees growth and cost discipline. Core FRE margin reached 39% in 2023 (vs. 37% in 2022).In H2 2023  Core FRE grew 18% compared to H1 2023  reflecting disciplined cost management. Core FRE margin reached 43% in H2 2023 compared to 36% in H1 2023 and 41% in H2 2022. Fee-Related earnings (FRE) stood at €107m in 2023  up 11% compared to 2022. FRE margin reached 34% compared to 33% a year ago. Performance-related earnings (PRE) amounted to €10m in 2023. This amount is equal to performance-related revenues and thus reflects the 100% conversion of such revenues into profit. As a consequence  EBIT for the asset management business  which corresponds to the sum of FRE and PRE  amounted to €117m in 2023  up 9% compared to a year ago.Increasing contribution from Tikehau Capital strategies to realized investment portfolio revenues Tikehau Capital’s investment portfolio generated €179m of revenues in 2023  primarily driven by the investments the Group has made in its own funds and strategies. The firm’s asset management strategies’ contribution to total portfolio revenues reached €179m and increased by 4% year-over-year and by 10% compared to 2021. Those revenue streams will continue to grow as the Group’s balance sheet invests in its own strategies and benefits from the associated returns. Portfolio revenues were mainly comprised of realized revenues   which stood at €190m in 2023. Realized revenues were driven by a 4% growth in dividends  coupons  and distributions  mainly coming from the firm’s own asset management strategies. The contribution from the firm’s own asset management strategies to realized revenues reached €168m  representing 88% of total realized revenues (vs. 71% in 2022) and increased by 21% year-over-year. The firm’s Private Debt and Real Assets strategies were the main contributors to realized revenues in 2023. Unrealized revenues stood at €(10)m in 2023 with €11m of positive unrealized revenues from the firm’s asset management strategies offset by €(21)m of unrealized revenues from ecosystem and direct investments. Unrealized revenues in 2023 include positive contributions from the firm’s Private Equity and Special Opportunities strategies  offset mainly by €/$ FX impacts and mark to market effects on the firm’s listed REITs. Of note  2022 unrealized revenues offered a high basis of comparison as they included c.€150m of positive impact from €/$ FX effect and positive change in fair value for the firm’s co-investment in the US media group Univision.Acceleration of profit generation in the second half of the year Financial result reached €(40)m in 2023   compared to €0.2m in 2022  which benefited from positive changes in swaps fair value offsetting financial interests linked to the firm’s financial debt. After taking into account stable corporate expenses at €(64)m  €(0.6)m of result from non-recurring and other items  €(15)m of tax expense  and €0.1m of minority interests   net result  Group share  reached €177m in 2023. Net profit  Group share grew materially over the second half of the year  reaching €105m (compared to €72m in H1 2023)  reflecting higher net profit generation for both Asset Management and Investment activities.A robust balance sheet with substantial skin in the game At 31 December 2023  consolidated shareholders’ equity   Group share reached €3.2bn and consolidated cash position reached €0.2bn  compared to €0.5bn at end-December 2022  reflecting the investments carried out over the period. The Group also benefits from an undrawn revolving credit facility  which has been increased to €800m in March 2022 with a maturity extended to July 2028.

Welcome and thank you for joining us for the presentation of Thales 2023 Full Year Results. I am Alexandra Boucheron  the Head of Investor Relations at Thales. With me today are Patrice Caine  Chairman and CEO and Pascal Bouchiat  CFO of Thales. As usual  the presentation will be in English and followed by a Q&A session. It is webcasted live on our website at thalesgroup.com where the slides  press release and consolidated financial statements are also available for download. A replay of the call will be available in a few hours. With that  I would like to turn over the call to Patrice Caine.Patrice Caine: So good morning  everyone. As usual  let’s start with the highlights of 2023 and I am on Slide #2. So starting with the commercial dynamics which was really strong across the entire portfolio and drove a new record for both order intake and backlog  our sales growth stands above the top of the guidance range set for this year at plus 7.9% on organic compared to a guidance between plus 5% and plus 7%. Strong achievements in terms of profitability as well with an EBIT margin at 11.6%  up 60 basis points compared to last year. And last  but not least  on the financials and of course Pascal will come back on it  cash generation has been very robust once again. Two highlights on the strategy side. First  we accelerated the deployment of our capital. We have been active in the rollout of our M&A strategy with three main acquisitions announced in 2023; Tesserent  Cobham Aerospace Communications and Imperva; as well as the disposal of our aeronautical electrical systems business. We have also successfully derisked our balance sheet from our UK pension obligations and we have conducted so far 92% of our share buyback program. And finally  we continued to progress in ESG ratings and performance  you will see that in a minute. So let’s move now to Slide #3 and looking at our financial performance in a few charts. At €23.1 billion  order intake stood once again above €23 billion and the Bouchiat book-to-bill ratio was significantly above 1 reaching 1.26. And please note  2022 was a high comparison year as we booked one jumbo contract  the Rafale order from the U.A.E. for 80 aircraft. As mentioned  organic sales growth reached a very high level above the top of our guidance range  plus 7.9%. EBIT outpaced sales organic growth growing by more than 10% while EBIT margin improved to 11.6%. At €1.768 billion  adjusted net income grew by 14% and free operating cash flow remained very strong at €2 billion  that’s even after the capital deployment I mentioned. Last chart on the slide  the dividend. This new year of strong financial performance is leading our Board to propose to the next AGM in May a 16% increase higher than the net income to €3.40 per share. So turning to Slide #4 and looking now at our non-financial performance in 2023. I will come back later on our sustainability priorities going forward. But first  I wanted to show you our strong progress in 2023 in terms of extra financial performance at/or above the 2023 targets along the four pillars of our action plan. First pillar  our strategy for a low carbon future. Our operational CO2 emissions reduction are outpacing our ambitious target decreasing by minus 52% thanks to a further reduction of electricity consumption and an extensive move to renewable energy supply. Turning to the deployment of eco-design  the percentage of new developments incorporating eco-design reached our target of 100%. Second pillar on the right  diversity and inclusion. The group is here again outpacing both targets. The percentage of management committees with more than three women reaching 87% and the percentage of women in senior management at 20.4%. Turning to ethics and compliance. On top of the extension of our ISO 37001 certification to Canada and the U.S.  we again mobilized the teams on anticorruption training of all exposed employees. With more than 8 000 employees trained in 2023  we achieved this target as well. And finally on health and safety at work  the frequency rate of accidents at work with subsequent lost work time decreased sharply by 37% versus 2018 compared to a target of 30% reduction. So after this rapid introduction  we will commence now our financial results in greater detail. So I am now on Slide #5. So starting with order intake dynamics  we achieved again a very strong order intake level in 2023  once again above €23 billion  namely €23.1 billion  almost aligned with the record high of 2022 and a book-to-bill of 1.26 and even 1.31 excluding DIS whose book-to-bill is structurally equal to 1. Strong performance and support to future growth as it represents the third year in a row that our book-to-bill is above 1.2. As shown on the slide  Q4 was a very strong quarter with 13 large orders over €100 million booked including one jumbo contract signed in the UK called Maritime Sensor Enhancement Team  MSET  to improve the Royal Navy ship’s availability and resilience over the next 15 years for a value just about €2 billion. This contract reflects our very strong positioning in naval and will include data driven decision-making to enable MSET to see behind the current support horizons and with the increased investment in emerging technologies including AI  virtual reality and big data creates a more proactive and predictive maintenance regime. Now looking at the different unit value of orders on the chart. You can see that small orders below €10 million increased in value despite the significant impact of IoT modules transferred to Telit at the end of fiscal year 2022 for €362 million. Adjusted from that impact  the organic growth of these small orders stands at plus 6% driven mostly by Aerospace at plus 14%. Large orders came slightly below 2022  but you remember that we booked the jumbo contract U.A.E. Rafale for a value just above €3 billion in 2022. So overall  a very solid performance again in 2023 in regards to order intake. Moving to Slide 6 and looking at sales. Well  the currency impact weighed negatively on sales over 2023 for a negative minus 1.5% and minus 1.4% over Q4. The total scope effect represented a negative 1.3% on sales  but there are many pluses and minuses behind this number. That is the reason why we have decided to include an additional slide in the appendix with a table of all impacts by quarters. So you can refer to Slide 44.Turning to our organic growth over the full year. Sales increased by plus 7.9% above the top of the guidance range with different dynamics across the 3 segments and  as I already mentioned  driven by the very strong performance of the Aerospace segment over the year. I will come back in greater details on the three segments in the next slide with Pascal. Turning to the geographical perspective  let me point out that growth was solid in mature markets and especially in France  the UK and all the rest of Europe and North America. Moving on now to Slide 7 looking at the EBIT performance drivers in 2023. As mentioned already  EBIT was up by 10.9% organically year-on-year with the margin progressing from 11% in 2022 to 11.6% in 2023 which is  as already said  a new record EBIT margin for the group. First  a word on the mechanical impacts. The strengthening of the euro had a small €21 million negative impact on our EBIT. Pensions were up by €36 million thanks to a lower level of liabilities over the period after a strong increase of the discount rate in 2022. But more importantly  you can see the solid progression of our gross margin up by €338 million at 28% of sales compared to 27.5% last year. And you have more details on the P&L in appendix Slide 37. Within indirect costs  R&D expenses continue to increase  but at a slower pace than sales representing 6% of total sales at the end of 2023 versus 6.1% at the end of 2022. That does not reflect a change of strategy  but again our decision in 2023 to allocate more resources to project execution. R&D remains a key driver of differentiation for Thales and I will come back on the subject in greater details later on. Our indirect costs have been in control. As you can see on the chart  G&A expenses and marketing and sales went up by less than the top line growth during the period. Finally  as expected  equity affiliates contributed less to our EBIT than in 2022 since last year we benefited from a €45 million positive one-off coming from Naval Group. Now looking briefly at each segment one by one and I’m now on Slide 8 for Aerospace. So orders at €5.6 billion were down by 5% organically due to high comps in both businesses. The Aeronautics business continued to be quite dynamic in Q4 with two large orders booked  one related to the training and simulation activities for the Rafale U.A.E. and one to install our new IFE product on board the future Emirates Boeing (NYSE: ) 777X. The 2023 double-digit organic growth was fueled by the civil aftermarket orders up 32% versus 2022. In Space while we booked 6 large contracts during the year in our observation  exploration and navigation business; the activity total orders booked in 2023 were below last year’s strong performance with no large order booked in 2023 in the telco business. As you know  this part of the business is going through a difficult path and not just at Thales. There was an overall decline in demand impacting the geostationary telecommunications satellite market in 2023 and again I will come back on the subject later on. Sales now: well  sales at €5.2 billion increased strongly up 11.7% organically clearly driven by the above expectations strong growth in Aeronautics showing a strong double-digit organic growth in both OE mostly driven by Airbus higher production rate and aftermarket activities benefiting from the ongoing traffic rebound over 12 months. This compensated the underperformance of the space business. As previously mentioned  the telco part is still facing supply chain challenges  notably the propulsion system  leading to execution delays on some programs. Overall  Space business revenues remained flat compared to 2022 and we expect that it should be the case again in 2024. Now if we look at profitability  EBIT margin further expanded from 5% in 2022 to 7.1% in 2023 driven by the strong performance of the Avionics business. Indeed this business was back to a double-digit EBIT margin in line with where it was before the sanitary crisis thanks to a strong operational leverage on the top line growth. On the other hand  Space came at break-even over the full year impacted by a flat top line versus 2022  higher costs due to inflation and delays in program execution as mentioned before. And maybe a last word before we move on to the next segment. As you know  we have been working at finalizing the Cobham deal and I can confirm that we are progressing very well. At this stage  we believe we should be able to integrate Cobham to the Group sometimes at the start of Q2 2024. It is an important information for you to adjust your models and also to be taken into consideration when looking at the full year guidance. So turning to Slide #4 looking at the Defence & Security segments. So order intake amounted to €14.1 billion  up 2% organically versus the €14 billion record high of 2022. Q4 was again a very strong quarter with 10 additional large orders booked bringing the total at 17 large orders above €100 million booked during 2023. Our backlog reached €35 billion at the end of 2023 versus €31 billion at the end of 2022  a new record high representing 3.6 years of sales. Sales amounted also to €9.8 billion  up by 7.5% organically versus 2022. Many business units reached again a double-digit type of organic growth like critical information systems  cyber defense solutions  above water systems or surface radars just to give a few examples. This strong level resulted from the combination of our strong backlog as mentioned above and the efforts to put by the group into ramping up its capacity to deliver on programs. And I will also come back on these ongoing CapEx efforts in the strategy part of the presentation. Last point  the EBIT margin as you can see  still strong at 12.8% and in line with the 2022 performance. So finally DIS  Digital Identity & Security  and I’m now on Slide #10. At €3.3 billion  sales were up by 4.1% organically and let me remind you here that the decrease in terms of value is due to the transfer of the IoT modules business to Telit from 31 December  2022 and this is for total sales of €362 million. Two different dynamics between H1 and H2 in terms of organic growth for this segment  a strong H1 across the different businesses at plus 11.7% and as anticipated  H2 slightly negative overall at minus 2.2%. The negative organic growth in H2 can be attributed to 2 distinct dynamics. On one hand digital solutions  namely cyber and biometrics  continued to perform very well with high single-digit organic growth despite the biometrics facing tough comparisons from H2 2022 and thus experiencing a normalization in activity levels since Q2 2023. On the other hand  smart cards experienced negative growth compared to very high comps in H2 2022 alongside decreased demand in terms of volumes and a decline in pricing. The influx of low cost competitors in the market led to a downward pressure on prices prompting us to prioritize profitability over volumes. While we could have potentially increased sales volume  the associated margin would have not been acceptable to us. And finally EBIT  EBIT was up by 1.5% organically at €508 million with an EBIT margin progressing significantly from 13.7% to 15.2% and this of course including the negative impact of the deconsolidation of the IoT modules. Other factors explaining the strong increase of the EBIT margin are number one  the net gross margin improvements compared to 2022  thanks to a favorable product mix including the transfer of the IoT modules I’ve just mentioned; and number two  the operating leverage on higher biometrics sales over 12 months. So let me just remind you 2 significant scope evolutions to take into consideration for 2024. Number one  first of course the integration of Imperva over the 12 months of 2024 as we finalized the deal beginning of December 2023. And number two  the transfer of the civil cyber activities from our Defense & Security segment from the 1st January 2024. We will come back on that part when commenting Slide 31 to give you more granularity. Turning now to Slide 11  looking at items below EBIT. First  the cost of net financial debts was lower in 2023 at €36 million versus €84 million in 2022  hence benefiting from the improvement of the group’s cash position compared to 2022 and the rise in interest rates over the period. On the other hand  the finance costs on pensions and other employee benefits went up from €35 million in 2022 to €76 million in 2023. This increase is mostly coming from France with a €31 million cost increase due to the sharp increase in rates in 2023 times 4 from 0.91% to 3.71% and partially offset by the drop in commitments versus 2022. Then taxes  as you can see  the effective tax rate is slightly decreasing at 20.1% versus 20.6% in 2022. We expect it to remain between 20% and 21% in 2024.Then minorities moving from a negative contribution in 2022 at minus €18 million to a positive contribution of €12 million in 2023 due to the Thales Alenia Space negative results in 2023. Leading into an adjusted net income from continued operations  group share moving up from €1.47 billion in 2022 to €1.66 billion in 2023. I just would like to stress out that this basis of comparison that you have to consider for next year  when the disposal of the transport division will have been finalized. On that note  everything is progressing as expected and we are confident that the deal will be closed by the end of H1 2024. Below you can see the adjusted net income from discontinued operations  which is the contribution of transport  up from €90 million in 2022 to €105 million in 2023. Please and as well that the group will no longer benefit from this additional contribution for the same reason just mentioned. All in all  this led to an adjusted net income group share reaching €1.77 billion and an adjusted EPS of €8.48  up 15% versus last year. Now a few words on the conversion of EBIT into free operating cash flow and I am now on Slide 12. First  a word on the usual recurring items. Regarding equity affiliates  which corresponds to the GAAP between our share in their net income and the actual dividends we received from them. This is where you find and the positive one-off at Naval Group. This year CapEx stands clearly above D&A resulting in a global negative balance of €171 million on our cash conversion. This definitely reflects the group’s strategy to invest into future growth and capture market opportunities and I will come back as well later on our future CapEx plans. Change in our WCR represented €173 million tailwind in 2023.And other cash items not included in the EBIT such as cash restructuring  ForEx or IFRS 16 lease depreciation amounted to a net €75 million positive. Finally  a transport contributed for €57 million in 2023. So all in all  another year of very strong free cash generation remaining above €2 billion in 2023. So now moving to Slide 13 commenting adjusted net income cash conversion that outperformed the 90% plus target set for this year. This robust performance can be attributed to several factors. Firstly  the order intake throughout the year exceeded expectations particularly in Defense & Security. Secondly  we have continued to benefit from favorable payment terms and phasing on our defense contracts. And lastly  the ongoing implementation of our cash action plan has yield positive results including improved on-time collection of invoices and successful management of inventory levels despite inflation and increased overall activity. It is worth noting that our first “CA$H!” initiatives was launched on 3 years ago now and we have decided to reintroduce an updated version in 2024 to further enhance these efforts in the future. For 2024  well  we anticipate another year of robust cash conversion close to 100% fueled by a projected additional down payments on 2024 order intake and existing contracts. Finally  moving on to Slide 14  with a quick look at the evolution of our net debt position. As I commented at the beginning of the presentation  we have materially accelerated in terms of capital deployment in 2023 especially with the acquisition of Imperva for $3.7 billion and with the UK pension obligation externalization that led to a minus €1.1 billion cash impact that corresponds to the sum of the corresponding pension deficit and the premium we paid to the entrant company that took over the obligation. The dividend cash-out increased to €634 million in 2023 versus €563 million in 2022 in line with the net income progression. The cash-out related to the share buyback amounted to €461 million. In our 2023  we purchased 3.5 million of shares over 12 months  which means that at the end of the year of last year 2023  we had already purchased 3.2% of the capital out of the 3.5% targeted. As a result of those pretty significant moving parts  the group’s net debt stands at €4 billion at the end of December 2023. So a word on dividends and I’m now on Slide 15. So this year the Board decided to maintain the payout ratio at 40%  which derives a dividend of €3.40 per share  up 16% versus 2022. As you see from the chart  this corresponds to a significant 25% per share increase in the dividend since 2020 reflecting the strong EPS performance. So that marks the end of the financial review. And now I will address our strategic priorities and guidance. So now I’m on Slide 17 and I’m turning to our strategy and outlook. So here are the 4 strategic priorities  we intend to focus on in the near-term and let me address them briefly one by one. So moving to Slide 18. To address the strong underlying trends in our markets  one of our primary focuses in the recent years has been to increase our capacities. This includes not only production in capacities  but more importantly  ensuring we have the right talent in place to seize market opportunities. We have successfully executed our ambitious recruitment plan announced a few years ago with significant progress made in 2022 and 2023 as illustrated in the graph. These hires have enabled us to strengthen our Engineering Centers in Romania and India and increase production output as planned. Additionally  it is worth noting that our global turnover decreased by more than 1.5 points returning to pre-COVID levels  which is a positive indicator of market recovery. To ensure the smooth integration of new hiring’s and provide them with the necessary tools for success  we have also enhanced our onboarding processes and established internal academies tailored to specific competencies. Looking ahead to 2024  we anticipate recruiting approximately 8 500 people for high expertise roles while continuing to invest in enhancing Thales brand awareness. Furthermore  internal mobility initiatives will be linked to the repositioning of our Space Telecommunication Sector  a topic I will explain later in this presentation. So moving to Slide 19. Well  ramping up also means investing in our facilities. As showed in the graph  we have further invested in 2023 to ramp up our production capabilities and we will continue to do so in 2024.We are  for instance  well on track to more than double our radar production capacity in France by 2025. Those CapEx have been used also to optimize our industrial footprint leading for example to sites such as our DIS site in Poland or some partnership projects for production localization in the Middle East  while seeking better adaptation of our sites to new modes of work  connectivity  attractiveness and so on and so forth and to the group’s environmental objectives carbon footprint  energy efficiency to mention a few. We have also launched a key project to deploy a global engineering information system highly secured and cloud based. This will develop velocity and fostering real-time cross-continental engineering team collaborations. In addition  we have been working tirelessly to mitigate supply chain tensions as well. While the situation has improved regarding electronic components  we are still rolling out broad action plans with our suppliers to mitigate recurring tensions on hardware namely PCB and mechanical parts to ultimately preserve our customers. Second priority and I’m now on Slide 20  sustaining excellence in R&D  which remains a major driver of competitiveness in our markets. So today  and I’m very proud to say so  Clarivate  the innovation analytics company  named Thales among the Top 100 global innovators for the 11th time in a row. This recognition illustrates the strength of our R&D leadership and our desire to remain very innovative as reflected in our impressive 20 500 patents portfolio. Of course to achieve this ambition  we continue to leverage on all sources of funding. A good example is R&D grants from the EDF (EPA: )  the European Defence Fund. We have benefited from more than €70 million grants in 2023 placing us as the main beneficiary of this fund. A significant share of our R&D expenses is also funded by customers like MoDs illustrating their appreciation of our valuable work. In terms of investment areas  we are still very much focused on quantum sensing  edge computing or open source hardware. A key area on which I would like to spend more time is also artificial intelligence. So let’s move now to Slide 21. So moving first on Slide 21 where I would like now to unveil the extent of Thales capabilities in AI for critical usages. AI is already a reality for Thales of course. We have been working on this for several years if not many years in a row. A few example among others AI can accelerate customers’ operations typically regarding POD Talios  the onboard AI analyzers in real-time optronics images captured in flight 100x faster than any current manual search. TopSky Sequencer in civil aeronautics. This allows increasing airport landing and takeoff capabilities by 20%. But AI can also improve decision-making and regarding our maritime patrol for instance  AI enables automatic target categorization of our SEARCHMASTER radars or another example on mine or related to mine countermeasure  AI leads to a revolutionary system that fully autonomously detects  identify and classify mines. So at Thales  we are already at scale with an impressive critical mass over 300 AI specialists from upstream R&D to implementation in sensors and systems. This internal expertise will help boost the group productivity also such as regarding automatic coding generation and massive testing. And last  let me point out that Thales is a pioneer to protect AI  its own AI and AI from others as well. This is a strategic issue for both our customers and Thales as well. We have been distinguished in many independent challenges in AI security like friendly hacking. Our capabilities allow us to ensure end-to-end security solutions  the robustness and cyber security of AI by mastering the variety of hacking threats and developing strategies to counter them. For example to avoid false classification of poised images  well  we introduce a watermarking solution. Thales TrUE AI approach is really key to develop our solutions  which meet three principles; they are transparent  they are understandable and they are ethical for a trustworthy AI. Moving now to Slide 22. This slide is to address the third strategic priority  sustainability. You already know this slide. Thales has more than ever a role to play in developing technologies contributing to a safer  greener and more inclusive world  safer through high tech equipment providing sovereign states with the means to protect their territory and population. Among the notable examples of 2023  we can cite the success of the GM 200 and GM 400 military radars  which enable many customers  many countries to monitor their airspace. Furthermore  the group’s growing prominence in cyber security stands out. With Imperva’s acquisition  we are now one of the top five global leaders in this field. Secondly  a greener world  more environmentally friendly  thanks to a range of solutions designed to reduce our customers’ ecological footprint or better observe environmental phenomena. For instance  in the civil aviation sector  Airbus adoption of the PureFlyt management system will help reduce airlines operations carbon footprint through flight path optimization. In the space sector  we won a major contract in 2023 for the establishment of the IRIDE constellation  a pioneering program in earth observation. And last and number three  a world that is more inclusive. A good illustration is the implementation of the TrUE biometrics offering that contributes to the advent of transparent  understandable and ethical biometric technologies aiming in particular to eliminate the risk of a discriminatory bias. Moving now to Slide 23. Our sustainability efforts have garnered external recognition as evidenced by the recent ratings we received. Typically  in March we obtained the SBTi certification  which served as confirmation of our significant pledges towards reducing CO2 emissions by 2030. In addition  the group was rated A by CDP  an impressive distinction placing Thales in the leading 1.5% companies. Similarly  the EcoVadis certification ranks Thales among the top 1% of companies Platinum medal. And finally  the group was selected by the Euronext Paris to join the CAC SBTi 1.5 index and was number one of in the SCE ranking concerning corporate scientific responsibility. Moving to Slide 24 now and this one is related to capital allocation. Over the past 2 years  we have successfully deployed all our capital allocation levers. We have been very active in M&A and portfolio management representing close to €4 billion impact as we announced not less than five acquisitions in cyber security and positioning now Thales as safety cockpit communication leader thanks to the announced acquisition of Cobham AeroComms. In terms of returns to shareholder  at the end of February we have conducted 92% of our share buyback program and then adding to that the dividends paid over the past 2 years  it represents a €2 billion contribution to shareholders. And finally  as we committed last year  we have successfully derisked our balance sheet from our UK pension obligations with a deal announced in December last year representing a €1 billion cash-out. It was the ideal spot to do so given the current level of interest rates and long-term inflation and their impact on the valuation of this liability. And let me remind you that since December 2023  we no longer need to make cash payments of around €100 million per year to fund this obligation. I’m now on Slide 25. So what can we expect this year in 2024? We will continue to keep an eye out for selective acquisitions applying the same strategy as always  seeking plug and play assets that complement our existing businesses while maintaining a strict discipline encompassing both financial and strategic assessments as well as valuation considerations. In terms of upcoming pluses and minuses to anticipate 2024  well  number one  we anticipate finalizing the acquisition of Cobham AeroComms along with the receipt of funds from the divestiture of our transport division with an estimated impact of €1.5 billion. Number two  our aim is to sustain our dividend payout ratio at around 40% alongside the completion of our ongoing share buyback program. And number three  our overarching objective remains unchanged to uphold a solid investment grade profile. Let me now give you some perspective on each of our operating segments starting with Avionics and I’m now on Slide 27. So we have identified several growth drivers for 2024 that will lead Avionic business to continue to grow at a more normalized pace in 2023 where sales grew by an exceptional 12% organically. First  aftermarket sales will continue to benefit from dynamic air traffic albeit at a slower pace than in 2023 where likely albeit built inventories. The ramp up of commercial aircraft production should continue as publicly stated by most of our customers despite still a tight supply chain. And in IFE  we have reported several commercial wins in 2023 that are progressively fueling sales recovery. Interesting to notice that historically focused on widebody  IFE products are progressively expanding to single aisle. And last demand remains robust for military avionics. Finally  we have been dynamic in terms of strengthening our portfolio with the acquisition of Cobham AeroComms as already mentioned and described and we have also disposed our aeronautical electrical systems. Let me now spend some time on our Space business and I’m now on Slide 28. So as a reminder  our space business is part of what is called the Space Alliance  which involves two joint ventures with Leonardo; namely Thales Alenia Space specialized in space infrastructures and Telespazio specialized in services. Thales Alenia Space is fully consolidated in Thales financial statements and Leonardo’s share is accounted for a non-controlling interest. On the other hand  Telespazio is consolidated as an equity affiliate. Regarding TAS  as you can see on the pie chart on the middle  one of our key assets is that we have a well-diversified portfolio of customers. Two-thirds of TAS sales are generated in institutional and military markets where we enjoy strong leadership positions. Those markets offer many domestic and export opportunities. For instance in November 2022  the European Space Agency Ministerial Council committed to its biggest ever budget increase leading to plus 17% in ESA budgets for the next 3 years namely 2022-2025 total subscriptions by member states equivalent to a yearly 5% growth  which will drive significant opportunities for us. That was for the first two-third. The remaining one-third of TAS activities are dedicated to commercial customers and mainly telecommunication operators such as ACS  Eutelsat or Intelsat. In this field as well  we offer best-in-class product range from GEO satellites to LEO and MEO constellations for instance. Despite current headwinds  we identify market opportunities over the long-term such as the new generation of highly flexible GEO satellite  software-defined satellite  the IRIS square constellation in Europe and several other LEO/MEO projects. And in defense  we see indisputable sovereign growing needs  Syracuse V project for the French MoD for instance. Now if we focus on the commercial telecommunication side and I’m on Slide 29. So yes  we have been facing in this activity the combination of conjunctional exogenous headwinds. No inflation passthrough mechanism in place while inflation has reached unprecedented levels and supply chain difficulties notably for propulsion in our case. Those have led to delays and higher costs in development of our new generation of satellites. In addition  the underlying market dynamics have been changing with lower GEO satellite orders moving from 20 historically to rather 10 per year in 2023 while the emergence of mega constellation impacts the business model of satellite operators. In this context  we are putting in place a contingency plan aiming to adapt our activity to the GEO market new size while maintaining our ability to manage constellations projects and leverage defense  satcom and OEN momentum that I previously described. These necessary structural adjustments to our cost base are leading to the redeployment of around 1 300 position  out of which 1 000 in France  to other Thales activities given the expected growth from the other activities of the group. This plan will be executed over 2024 and 2025 and a social process will be launched in the coming weeks. The ultimate objectives being: number one  adjust the workforce to the current workload; number two  reduce fixed costs to enhance competitiveness; and number three  as a consequence  restore Space midterm profitability towards 7% EBIT margin. Turning to our second reporting segment  Defence & Security and I’m now on Slide 30. Firstly  demand remains robust and our backlog has reached a new record high at 3.6 years. Geopolitical tensions are pushing up budgets in our key regions giving us opportunities to grow. In addition  our product lineup meets the needs of customers preparing for high intensity conflicts and EU initiatives are backing joint procurement with new funds and aiming to make as much as half of its defense system purchase within the EU by 2035. Sales are steady and should continue to grow despite some supply chain issues and we are ramping up capacity to meet demand as I explained earlier. From a margin standpoint  we expect to continue to deliver industry-leading margins close to 13%. Well  I’m now on Slide 31 looking at our third and last segment DIS. Firstly  cyber security remains a top priority. We are in the process of integrating Imperva and Tesserent about which we are very excited about as they enable us to expand our leadership position in the market  including application security and premium cyber security services. Additionally  we are transferring civil activities from Defence & Security creating even more synergies. Our R&D efforts in biometrics are aimed at building product leadership  ensuring we stay ahead of the curve in this rapidly evolving field and we grow our profitability in this field. With smart cards  our focus remains on maximizing margin contribution as we did in 2023. We are expanding our cloud-based business models with promising transitions to eSIM and ebanking services. And a very important message  we estimate that in 2024 rSIM  removable SIM  should only represent 7% of DIS revenues. Lastly  we are anticipating a normalization of demand and stock levels providing resilience for our operations. Let me comment as well key 2023 realizations that are fueling 2024 pipeline. In securing mobile connectivity  we have seen a strong acceleration of eSIM adoption primarily in the U.S.  but not only. In 2023 we have more than doubled the number of eSIM activations performed in our extensive install base of on-demand connectivity platforms. We have also crossed a very important milestone with now more than 100 million of cars securely connected with our automotive eSIMs. In payments  we are supporting the move to eco-friendly payment cards with a full range of recycled plastics or biosourced cards. We have more than doubled the number of eco-friendly cards delivered in 2023 crossing the 250 million units milestone. We are also enjoying significant growth with fin-techs. Those fin-techs issuing more and more physical payment cards  a strong indicator that physical payments card are here to stay in the foreseeable future. Lastly  with the acquisition of Imperva  our cloud-based annual recurring revenues has enjoyed a step change with a threefold increase. The Imperva contribution coming on top of an already sizable and fast growing set of transaction and subscription-based revenues like the SIM activations I’ve just mentioned  like our digital banking solutions or our customer identity and access management platform. So all this brings me to our financial objectives for 2024 and considering the strategic priorities and business outlook that I just described. I’m now on Slide 32. So with respect to order intake  we expect another year of strong commercial performance driving a book-to-bill ratio above 1. We expect sales to grow organically between 4% and 6% and based on the February 2024 foreign exchange rates and Cobham Aerospace Communications integration as of April 2024  this corresponds to sales between €19.7 billion and €20.1 billion. Incorporating all the drivers we discussed earlier  we expect a further improvement in EBIT margin reaching between 11.7% and 12%. So this concludes my presentation. Many thanks for your attention. Pascal has just arrived. He was a bit late and stuck in the traffic to be transparent so that’s why I was the only speaker this morning. But now Pascal is with us and we are happy together to answer your questionsOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the questions come from the line of Christophe Menard from Deutsche Bank. Please ask you question. Your line is opened.Christophe Menard: Yes. Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. The first question I have. I know it’s early days but for Imperva  can you comment on the attrition rate if any that you may have seen or conversely  is it easier to retain people or employees at the moment in the tech world? That’s the first question. The second question was on the aftermarket growth in Avionics. What kind of growth should we expect? I understand that it should be lower than in 2023  but still what we’ve heard from other sectors like the engine guys  there’s still strong growth in aftermarket. So is it something similar or can you help us quantify a little bit? And regarding the Space restructuring  can you give us a little bit more detail on the restructuring cost and also what proportion of employees the 1 300  that represents as a whole of the Space activities? Any further color on this would be interesting and helpful. Thank you.Pascal Bouchiat: Good morning  Christophe  Pascal Bouchiat speaking. And once again sorry for being late this morning. I was  as Patrice mentioned  blocked in traffic jams. Maybe I will start with your third question about Space  Christophe. And yes  it’s true that of course we will have a bit higher level of restructuring charges for 2024. By the way  this is embedded in our guidance on our EBIT margin. And if I look first at Thales as a whole  if you look back at the recurring level of restructuring charge on our P&L  if you look in the last 3 years including 2023  we were more around €90 million. In 2024 we believe that this level will be significantly above  probably something like €120 million and this reflecting two things. One is the cost associated with the recovery of Space. And also second  but that’s the point that we have already highlighted in the past  of course Imperva. We need to spend a bit of cash in order to integrate this business. So overall  this plan for Space will be delivered in 2024  2025. Overall  as a rule of thumb  let’s consider that in term of overall restructuring charges on our P&L  it will be something like €50 million so which  as you mentioned  is a bit significant. Even though as we mentioned  most of the employees that are affected by these situations will be redeployed within Thales. But still in particular in managing mobility  this creates training people  all of that has of course a bit of a cost. You ask for how large is it relative to the size of our Space business. So overall  our Space business has a total headcount of around 8 500 people. So you see here we are talking about 1 300 jobs out of 8 500 headcount in this business. AGS  as we mentioned  the performance in 2023 was outstanding above our expectations and overall around 30% growth versus 2022 with probably some kind of catch-up effect. And in particular when it comes to spare parts  probably airlines have stopped ordering spare parts throughout the COVID and probably were willing to catch-up in 2023. Now going forward  I don’t want to be that specific. Of course  there is no reason why overall level of growth on our aftermarket would be different from the one from our competitors or the players  suppliers of this type of equipment; it should be similar. But of course it’s a bit more difficult at this point to be more precise on this front. What I can do overall  Christophe  maybe is to guide you not just only on AGS  but probably your questions allows me to come back on a more global footprint about what did we factor in our guidance in term of organic growth rate for Thales as a whole and what does this mean for our Avionic business. Overall  it’s consistent with probably a mid single-digit plus type of organic growth for overall Avionics business. Your last question was about Imperva attrition rate.Patrice Caine: So  hello  Christophe. So nothing is noticeable if I may say so quite reassuring. We have not observed any surge in the attrition rate. It’s quite standard for this type of activity  very reasonable in fact. So we are confident that all the talents that we need to retain will stay with us and are happy to work with Thales now.Christophe Menard: Thank you  [indiscernible]. Thank you very much.Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] and the questions come from the line of George Zhao from Bernstein. Please ask your question. Your line is open.George Zhao: Hi  good morning  everyone. First on cash use  your current share buyback program expires this month. Given that you’re going to have a net cash inflow from the AeroComms acquisition and the transport disposal  I guess how are you thinking about potential for further share repurchase beyond this month? And second one  drilling further into your 4% to 6% organic growth forecast this year. You said DIS is expected to be in-line with last year’s 4%  Aerospace decelerating a little bit from 12% last year. I guess that seems to leave Defence & Space in the 5%-ish range. I guess is that your working assumption for the segment or are you assuming something higher towards the path of the mid single-digit plus growth that you’ve been talking about? Thanks.Pascal Bouchiat: Thank you very much  George  for those two questions. Maybe I will start on your question about Defence. So you remember our guidance that we communicated just a year-ago in the 2023-2024 period of time and at that time we said that we’re expecting Defence organic growth to be mid-single digits in 2023 and mid-single digit plus in 2024. Now when you look at our 2023 figures  I guess you concur with me saying that we have outperformed the level of organic growth for our Defence & Security business because overall it stands at 7.5% so above expectation. Now looking forward in 2024  I guess that you will realize the size of our backlog for this business. So the traction is there. Now we also need also to share with you that we keep having a material impact from the supply chain. This is today clearly the limiting factors on the supply chain. I can tell you that 2023 has been quite a bumpy journey in terms of managing the supply chain in particular in our Defence business and probably a bit difficult at this point to say whether or not we will see significant progress or not on this matter. This is in particular the case on two-type of components: one being a PCB  printing circuit boards. And the second being more extensively on hardware where we keep seeing a number of suppliers and this is not just in a single country  but really across the board in many countries  are still struggling to ramp up their overall production capabilities. And that’s for me and probably today the limiting factors. When you put all of that together  at this point what is implicit in our guidance is a level of organic growth for Defence & Security business  probably mid-single digit to mid-single digit plus. That’s probably the best rule of thumb today. Even though we have enough in term of backlog to go even further  but with these limiting factors that I mentioned. Your first question about usage of cash. I guess that we have been quite explicit on what we have done in 2023 and within particular this decision to de-risk our balance sheet with regard the issue of UK pension funds where  as we said  we have allocated €1 billion of capital on this matter and this has to be taken into account in the overall equations. So what we are going to do is of course to complete this share buyback. This will be done by the end of March as expected  as committed. That’s a program that we started 2 years ago and we said it will be completed in 2 years’ time and this is basically what we have done. I guess that we have demonstrated that Thales can use this type of tool when it comes to managing  optimizing its overall capital structure. I don’t see us moving on these fronts in the next few months. Now  that’s an open topic  which means that we will keep working with our Board to see what it means in the mid-terms. So I mean first  we demonstrated that it works. Second  probably not in the very short-terms  but the line is still opened with our Board on this matter.George Zhao: Very great. Thank you.Operator: Thank you. We are now going to proceed with our next question. And the questions come from the line of David Perry from JPMorgan. Please ask your question.David Perry: Hi. Yes. Good morning Pascal and Patrice. So  two questions  the first is just on the smart card business  can you just remind me what’s the kind of visibility on that? Is it a business you plan quarter-to-quarter or do you have visibility 6 months  12 months just on things like volume and price? And the second one  maybe I will chip and make it part A and part B. But on Space  what’s the timeframe you have got in mind to return to a 7% margin? And part B  Leonardo last Thursday was suggesting that there had been some talks perhaps with Airbus about industry consolidation to deal with some of the challenges you have got. Could you talk to that  please? Thank you very much.Pascal Bouchiat: Okay. Thank you very much for your questions  I mean – David. So  first on smart cards  this is  as we keep seeing  a short-term type of business in terms of cycle  which means that I mean the overall visibility in term of order intake is more in the three months to six months. So  it’s of course I mean a short-term type of visibility. Now  having said that  I mean we track the market. We have got indicators that give us in our view quite a good view on how things should develop throughout 2024. I tend to believe that now in term of price  I mean the visibility is more. I mean let’s say it’s a 1-year horizon when it comes to banking  even in some cases a bit further than that. I mean the price anticipations on removable SIM accounts is more limited. It’s more a question of a couple of months and that’s also what’s important. Now  when we look at the sales of our removable SIM business  in 2024  the revenue of removable SIM will be below €300 million  which represents less than 7% overall of the overall revenue of our DIS business. We have seen – and by the way  I mean less than €300 million  it’s something like 40% of the sales of mobile communication solution business line. And the reason for that is that we keep developing a lot of digital business embedded SIM with behind that I mean services  so in particular  the rise of activations and Patrice made it clear in his presentations. And also second thing  which is going pretty nicely  is embedded SIM communications in other markets and in particular in the car industry. Today  most of new cars are equipped with embedded SIM and we take advantage of this new business in particular when it comes to activation. So on Space  I mean we mentioned I mean a return to this 7% of EBIT margin in the mid-term. So  in the mid-terms in our understanding is probably something around 20%  27%  David  if you want me to be a bit more precise. And last point was  Patrice  I mean on discussion.Patrice Caine: Hello David. Good morning. Well  we are with Airbus and ourselves and Leonardo in the consortium for IRS square [ph]. So  it’s quite I would say natural that we discuss on this particular topic. IRS square is a big initiative led by the EU as you know. Still  by the way  difficult to predict whether it will come to a positive outcome or not because it’s quite a complex endeavor for everybody. So  that’s the main purpose of our discussion with Guillaume and Roberto. And the rest are  I would say  more or less a speculation where you know everything about the sector  it’s quite concentrated and complex. So  my main focus as Thales is really to succeed our restructuring plan on telco. That’s top priority for the Space Alliance to grow our OEN business which is a nice business  again two-third of that is related to observation  exploration and navigation. And a third  to continue to develop and if possible invest in the services part of Telespazio. So  you see  we have already plenty of food on our plate  so we shall focus on that and try to make IRS Square happen  which is of another kind  but very important for all of us.David Perry: Thanks. That’s very clear. Thank you.Operator: Thank you. We are now going to proceed with our next question. And the questions come from the line of Aymeric Poulain from Kepler Cheuvreux. Please ask your question. Your line is open.Aymeric Poulain: Yes. Thank you very much  indeed good morning everybody. So  the first question for me is on capital allocation and if we combine the acquisition of Gemalto (AS: ) and Imperva  we have an investment in excess of €9 billion and DIS currently contributes slightly in excess of €500 million of EBIT. So  when do you expect the return of these two large deals to meet your order rates? And perhaps on that  do you see the comments made by Palo Alto recently around the potential slowdown of cyber security market as a risk to this target? That will be the first question. And the second one on share buyback versus M&A  obviously you have been paying top dollars for a large acquisition while the stock price has not performed well relative to its peer and now arguably trades at a decent discount to most of its closest comparable. So  how do you actually make the decision on capital allocation between share buyback and M&A and what would be the criteria you would use to justify perhaps a second share buyback? Thank you.Pascal Bouchiat: Good morning Aymeric  maybe I will start with your first questions for analysis about I mean what we invested in Gemalto and Imperva and I mean the €500 million that you mentioned being the EBIT. I think that you are a bit unfair because you mentioned I mean the combinations of Gemalto acquisition plus Imperva  but you just take into account I mean the contributions of Gemalto and not take into account the contributions of Imperva in terms of bottom line that is of course going to happen from 2024. First point now I mean when looking and I let’s I mean split your question in two parts. One is the acquisition of Gemalto  we are today with the level of EBIT  which is reported in this business plus also some synergies that we managed to get in other businesses. We are already today on Gemalto acquisition at a level of returns which exceeds our cost of capital  first point. Second point  as we announced Imperva transactions  we made it clear that we would be able to meet the hurdle rate in terms of cost of capital. I think that we mentioned for 5 years post the transactions and this is basically what I confirm to you today. So  this is how I could answer your questions. Your question on Palo Alto  what was it exactly?Aymeric Poulain: I think two weeks  three weeks ago there was a significant drop in their share price and they commented on the potential slowdown of the cyber security market and I wondered if that kind of impacted your own cyber security business.Pascal Bouchiat: Overall  I mean we expect globally our cyber security business in 2024 to be I mean at high-single digit to low-double digit business overall when it comes to in particular global security products including Imperva. This is basically what we forecast  so no specific additional comment on this matter. By the way  I mean we keep seeing more and more of our customers really open and willing I mean to have a vendor like Thales to be able to come up with an integrated offer. I mean this concept of a one-stop shop  which is more and more important for our clients  and considering I mean the complexity of the offer. So for us  Thales being able to come up with this global fully integrated data security platform together with this new offer on app sec and all of that combined with our offer on identity access management. So  really I mean placing Thales really at the heart of the key vendors when it comes to cyber security supply is what we see is more and more appreciated by our clients. Your second question was about share buyback and M&A  so I mean overall  I think I mean we demonstrated our ability to move on various tracks when it comes to I mean capital allocations. And at the end of the day  it’s in my view quite a balanced move on one side  and meaningful acquisitions that are preparing the future of this company in term of quality of businesses in particular in those businesses where we see a clear potential for higher growth. This combined with quite a significant level of cash upstream to our shareholders  I mean just in 2022  2023 €2 billion upstream. And as I mentioned  I mean this will be open. Of course we also need to take into account I mean when it comes to share buyback the impact of the rise in interest rates. All of that I mean has also to be taken into account. And also specific decisions when it comes also to manage a long-term risk of Thales and in particular when it comes to managing I mean pension obligations where I mean we really fix this issue in UK. Now  I mean to be more explicit when it comes to M&A criteria  of course valuations multiple is of course at the heart of our analysis. Of course I mean valuations or return on invested capital of course is also part of the overall equations.Aymeric Poulain: Okay. Thank you.Operator: We are now going to proceed with our next question. Please standby. Our next questions come from the line of Tristan Sanson from BNP Paribas (OTC: ). Please ask your question.Tristan Sanson: Yes. Good morning. Patrice  Pascal  thank you very much for taking my question. So  the first one is on Defence margin in 2023. So  you had 7.5% organic growth  margin is a slight pullback. Can you help us understand how much you think of the supply chain difficulties have been dragging down the margin and whether you think you can improve that a bit further as you saw over time this supply chain drag? And the second question is a more general question about efficiency within the group. As you are saying  you are investing in staffing and preparing for the stronger growth for the group. Can you comment on where do you think productivity and especially employee productivity is within the group today and where you want to bring it over time? Thank you.Pascal Bouchiat: Okay. So  Tristan  maybe I will start with your first questions about I mean Defence. I mean it is true that in 2023  as I mentioned earlier  we have been a bit impacted by supply chain difficulties. And despite that  we delivered this quite strong level of growth  but at the expense of I mean a lot of efforts at our teams. I mean our teams have done a fantastic job in I mean navigating through I mean those difficulties. Now  when it comes to – and I guess your questions was more yes  but what does it mean to the bottom line  so I mean it’s always a bit difficult because it’s in some cases a bit stop and go  I mean having to wait for a part from the supply chain to arrive. So  I mean this type of difficulties. It’s probably a few tens of millions euro of bottom line impact  probably something like €20 million  €30 million  €40 million in terms of bottom line impact overall  which you see at the end of the day is not that significant. But it’s more I mean the fact that really I mean our teams has to get mobilized more than 100 persons to navigate through this type of difficulties  productivity?Patrice Caine: On productivity  of course we work on as many levels as possible. Typically  I tried to mention some of them in the engineering side like the use of Gen AI to generate code automatically or semi-autonomously or to use Gen AI as well for massive testing and so on and so forth. Now  it’s really come and there is of course the operational level as well thanks to growth. Now  which really counts is the margins. We can generate the level of profit and as you know  we navigate I would say first at already a high level in terms of margin. And Defence 13% clearly it’s best in class and including of course the U.S. peers. And also we are I would say at least in Defence  most of the time margins are audited  so we need also to keep that in mind. Sky cannot be the limit in this regard. So  for us when we work on productivity  probably it’s a lever that counts  but we do count even more on innovation and technology to drive growth. It’s more a question of growth now than a question of trying to extract even more profit from our customers. Governmental customers are also sensitive ones about profit. That’s why DNA of Thales being tech and innovation is quite suited for this type of customers and markets and that’s why we insist so much on preparing the future  investing in new technologies to drive I would say differentiators and growth today and tomorrow.Tristan Sanson: Thank you. Very helpful. I think my question was not very clear  so I apologize for that. But what I meant is that when you look at the strong recruitment of over 10 000 employees per year in ‘22 and ‘23 and still at 8 500  these big recruitment do not drive in your view a temporary drop in productivity…?Patrice Caine: Yes. You are right  Tristan. Very hard to measure it precisely  but clearly younger juniors are less efficient than super senior experts that retire of course. That’s a challenge. That’s why we mentioned during the presentation our efforts onboarding  on training  the setting up of internal academies as well. More and more  I would say we professionalized ourselves in this regard. But still you are right to say that probably there is a slight loss of efficiency with newcomers.Pascal Bouchiat: So  I would I mean say additional cost to keep growing our business  in particular in businesses that requires a lot of expertise  Defence is probably a good example. Now  I mean it’s really our duty to manage that as effectively as possible. Hence I mean those various actions that we highlighted  internal academies for instance is quite important. Also it’s good to see I mean our turnover getting back to pre-COVID because it means less recruitments  everything else being equal. And also I mean as a market is a bit less tight than it was in the last 2 years in particular in 2022. But also in the first half of 2023  it’s also for us important also to rebalance in term of recruitments between beginners and engineers that have more seniority and which can be onboarded more quickly. That’s also I mean part of what we are looking for.Tristan Sanson: Thank you very much for this color.Operator: Thank you. We are now going to proceed with our next question. And it comes from the line of Chloe Lemarie from Jefferies. Please ask your question. Your line is open.Chloe Lemarie: Yes. Good morning. I have a first one on Space  please. I would want to know what would be the key moving parts from the current breakeven to 7% margin target. Is it the restructuring impact of volume or pricing? Second one is on Defence & Security. If you could give a bit more color on the 2023 performance excluding the cyber security assets which were transferred to DIS because it looks like it was already above the 13% margin that you guide for 2024? So  is it just a matter of prudence for 2024 investment in R&D or any other product mix headwind  please?Pascal Bouchiat: Good morning Chloe. So  let’s start with Defence and so what we released in term of EBIT margin is 12.8%. Now  if I adjust for the transfer from Defence to DIS business  it’s probably slightly above 13% and it’s probably here again a good rule of thumb I mean for the next few years. So  13% is probably I mean the right figure. Managing a business of this size with 10 basis points  I am sorry  but in some cases can be a bit challenging. So  13% is the right figures  which once again is really at par with I mean very big peers particularly in U.S. And I think in both cases  with both I mean European peers in Defence & Security. Your first question was about Space  but I am not sure that I got it because the line was not good. Chloe  if you can repeat it  please?Chloe Lemarie: Okay. So  on Space  I wanted to know what were the key moving parts from the current breakeven to 7% restructuring volume and pricing?Pascal Bouchiat: Understood. So  what we are looking for is really I mean to restore the profitability of our Space business without seeking for additional growth or in other words  I mean considering the level of revenue that we posted in 2023 €2.2 billion and the question for us is how to restore the profitability based on this level of revenue. I am not saying that we will not seek for growth  but what we want to do is to restore profitability on the basis of the existing level of workload. And hence  I mean this overall cost adaptation plan that we have presented and of course I mean this will of course be a significant driver for this margin recovery. The second one is the completion of large investments on our new generation of geostationary satellites in which we are investing quite significantly. In which by the way and we mentioned I mean the points  we met in particular supply issue with regards I mean the supply of the engine of the satellite  which also caused some I mean additional cost and some delays. Now  of course I mean probably in a year time  this development will be for most of it behind us and will be also to adjust the level of investment in line with this quite significant effort that we are doing today. That was the case in ‘22  ‘23 and this will be the case in 2024. So  with quite significant investments including  by the way in self-funded R&D I mean to support the finalizations of this quite large development. So  they are the two key elements. Now  of course I mean we believe that observations  explorations and navigations business will continue to grow  always a good level of margin. But my message today is I mean really to ensure this overall recovery at a level of workload which is in line with what we see today in particular on our telco business.Chloe Lemarie: Great. Thank you.Operator: [Operator Instructions] And the next questions come from the line of Ian Douglas-Pennant from UBS. Please ask your question. Your line is open.Ian Douglas-Pennant: Thanks for squeezing me in the last five minutes. I have two  please  one on DIS  one on Space. On DIS  could you talk about the outlook for pricing beyond I guess your insight that you mentioned in the next six months to 1 year? It seems like prices especially in bank cards should be still elevated at this point. Should we expect a headwind thereafter as those continue to normalize or am I wrong? And secondly  on the Space business  the IRS square contract  and could you talk about what your expectation is on the timing and the potential size of that to Thales? And additionally on that  given that you are reducing cost in the Space business  how does that impact if it’s at all your ability to execute on that contract if it was awarded? Thank you.Pascal Bouchiat: Okay. Good morning Ian. So  I will start with I mean your question on DIS outlook and on pricing. I think what is very important to consider for you guys is not just the pricing  but pricing as compared to input costs. And at the end of the day what matter is not that much pricing  it’s really margin  so the gap between selling prices and input cost. And it’s true that we have seen it in the recent past quite a significant drop in input cost when it comes to in particular components. Now  when you put all of that together  I mean our view is that I mean we will keep enjoying and this is what we see today in 2024 quite a strong level of margin for all our smart card businesses whether it’s banking  but also I mean the removable SIM business. All of that will mean that probably in the first half of 2024 and in particular in Q1 in term of level of revenue as we will compare against quite a strong Q1 2023  overall in terms of revenue there will be probably a bit of a drop in terms of revenue  but still quite good level of margin. But we will see as early as Q2 I mean the situations returning positively with  on the second half of 2024  a positive move in terms of level of revenue for our smart card businesses. All of that by the way being consistent with I mean the level of guidance that we provided to you on the expected growth for profitability for DIS. Patrice  on IRS square  maybe?Patrice Caine: Hello Ian  yes  on IRS square  perhaps a few elements or pieces of information. It was supposed to start or to have I would say a clear go ahead beginning of this year. Now  it’s a complex project. As you know  there is a combination of public fundings and private fundings and the consortium is a large one. So  honestly  it’s difficult to say. It’s difficult to say  so I would rather be prudent. Still we are extremely motivated with the different consortium members  but it’s difficult to be more precise than that or just repeating the official timing  which is beginning of this year. Now  two additional remarks perhaps  Ian. The 7% EBIT that we have discussed is independent from IRS square should it take off or not  so it’s kind of a bulletproof or independent from this large project. I think it’s prudent  I would say  to do so. And secondly  IRS square is not the only I would say constellation projects on which we work. We work on other ones which are confidential  so I cannot disclose them  but which are privately led and that may come into play in the future. So  just giving you a bit of color that they are the geostationary markets we have discussed during the presentation  but still constellation  LEO constellations are clearly opportunities that may come in addition to the market size we see in terms of geostationary satellites. Hope it helps.Ian Douglas-Pennant: Thanks very much.Pascal Bouchiat: I understand that we need to stop I mean the call. Patrice  if you want to make some maybe conclusion remarks.Patrice Caine: Yes. So  let me just close rapidly with a few words of conclusion. So  as you have understood  2023 was another year of strong performance for Thales indeed. Now  we are fully focused on the execution of our profitable growth strategy supported by rigorous capital allocation and we have had many questions on capital allocation in this respect. Now  with Pascal  we look forward to speaking with you in the upcoming investor roadshows and conference. So  thank you very much for your attention. Have a nice day and we will see you soon. Goodbye.Pascal Bouchiat: Thank you very much.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

We are excited to present a broad set of data at AAN this year that collectively demonstrate how we are delivering on our promise to transform patients’ lives with innovative treatments.”Transforming Autoimmunity by Targeting FcRnFindings from the ADHERE study of VYVGART Hytrulo in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) will be presented for the first time in an oral presentation during the Clinical Trials Plenary Session  taking place on Tuesday  April 16  2024. These positive data from the ADHERE study have been submitted to the FDA for potential approval of VYVGART Hytrulo in CIDP with a PDUFA target action date of June 21  2024.In addition to the full ADHERE data  the AAN presentations will highlight clinical trial and real-world data showcasing the broad opportunity with VYVGART  a first-in-class neonatal FC receptor (FcRn) inhibitor  and VYVGART Hytrulo  to deliver significant value to the generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) patient community by driving consistent and repeatable improvements across patient subtypes  a favorable and predictable safety profile  and the ability to individualize treatment across both intravenous and subcutaneous administration and dosing schedules.Story continuesAchievement of MSE enables significant quality of life improvements : ADAPT/ADAPT+ demonstrate that >40% of patients achieve minimal symptom expression (MSE) across both studies. Patients achieving MSE experience quality of life outcomes comparable to healthy populations  suggesting MSE could be a primary goal of gMG treatment.Favorable safety profile across IgG-mediated autoimmune diseases: A review of safety findings across multiple studies of VYVGART in IgG-mediated autoimmune diseases showed VYVGART was consistently well tolerated across all indications and doses studied.ADAPT NXT evaluated additional individualized dosing regimens for initiating long-term treatment: Data from the Phase 3b ADAPT NXT study will provide important guidance on different treatment regimens  which will allow for additional individualization of VYVGART treatment.Potential for tapering of oral corticosteroids (OCS) post-VYVGART initiation : Long-term OCS use continues to be a significant burden on people living with autoimmune disease and reducing or tapering OCS may alleviate the risk of many adverse events related to long-term usage. Early insights into OCS utilization post-efgartigimod initiation in gMG patients indicate that a substantial proportion reduced OCS usage over the first 6 months of treatment.Cost-effectiveness of VYVGART compared to chronic intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg): Findings from a cost-effectiveness analysis of VYVGART versus chronic IVIg for the treatment of gMG showed that  over a lifetime  VYVGART provided greater benefit at lowers costs.Details for oral and poster presentations at AAN are as follows:Title Lead Author Presentation Efficacy  Safety  and Tolerability of Efgartigimod in Patients With Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy: Results From the ADHERE TrialJeffrey Allen Oral Presentation during Clinical Trial Plenary SessionTuesday  April 16  9:15-11:30 a.m. MT Real-world Reduction in Oral Corticosteroid Utilization following Efgartigimod Initiation in Patients Living with Generalized Myasthenia GravisNeelam Goyal Oral PresentationWednesday  April 173:42 p.m. MT Cost-effectiveness Analysis of Efgartigimod versus Chronic Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIg) for Treatment of Acetylcholine Receptor Antibody Positive (AChR-Ab+) Generalized Myasthenia Gravis (gMG) in CanadaZaeem Siddiqi Poster PresentationMonday  April 1511:45 a.m.-12:45 p.m. MT Overview of the Safety Profile from Efgartigimod Clinical Trials in Participants with Diverse IgG-mediated Autoimmune DiseasesTuan Vu Poster PresentationMonday  April 1511:45 a.m.-12:45 p.m. MT Long-Term Safety  Tolerability  and Efficacy of Subcutaneous Efgartigimod PH20 in Participants With Generalized Myasthenia Gravis: Interim Results of the ADAPT-SC+ StudyJames Howard Poster PresentationWednesday  April 1711:45 a.m.-12:45 p.m. MT Fixed-Cycle and Continuous Dosing of Intravenous Efgartigimod for Generalized Myasthenia Gravis: Study Design of ADAPT NXTVera Bril Poster PresentationWednesday  April 1711:45 a.m.-12:45 p.m. MT Achievement of Minimal Symptom Expression and Effect on Disease-Specific Measures in Acetylcholine Receptor Antibody-Positive Participants With Generalized Myasthenia Gravis Treated With Efgartigimod in ADAPT/ADAPT+Srikanth Muppidi Poster PresentationWednesday  April 1711:45 a.m.-12:45 p.m. MT Analysis of Serious Infections and Malignancy Risk in Myasthenia Gravis: a US Claims Database StudyJana Podhorna Poster PresentationWednesday  April 1711:45 a.m.-12:45 p.m. MTMore information on the program is available at AAN.See Important Safety Information below  full United States Prescribing Information for VYVGART and full Prescribing Information for VYVGART Hytrulo for additional information.What is VYVGART® (efgartigimod alfa-fcab) for intravenous (IV) infusion and what is VYVGART® HYTRULO (efgartigimod alfa and hyaluronidase-qvfc) for subcutaneous injection?VYVGART and VYVGART HYTRULO are both prescription medicines  each used to treat a condition called generalized myasthenia gravis  which causes muscles to tire and weaken easily throughout the body  in adults who are positive for antibodies directed toward a protein called acetylcholine receptor (anti-AChR antibody positive).IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONDo not use VYVGART if you have a serious allergy to efgartigimod alfa or any of the other ingredients in VYVGART.

Approximately 85% of people with MG progress to gMG within 24 months 1 where muscles throughout the body may be affected. Patients with confirmed AChR antibodies account for approximately 85% of the total gMG population.1About Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating PolyneuropathyChronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) is a rare and serious autoimmune disease of the peripheral nervous system. Although confirmation of disease pathophysiology is still emerging  there is increasing evidence that IgG antibodies play a key role in the damage to the peripheral nerves. People with CIDP experience fatigue  muscle weakness and a loss of feeling in their arms and legs that can get worse over time or may come and go. These symptoms can significantly impair a person's ability to function in their daily lives. Without treatment  one-third of people living with CIDP will need a wheelchair.About VYVGART®VYVGART is a human IgG1 antibody fragment that binds to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)  resulting in the reduction of circulating IgG autoantibodies. It is the first approved FcRn blocker in the United States  EU and China for the treatment of adults with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) who are anti- acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive and in Japan for the treatment of adults with gMG who do not have sufficient response to steroids or non-steroidal immunosuppressive therapies (ISTs).About VYVGART® HytruloVYVGART Hytrulo is a subcutaneous combination of efgartigimod alfa  a human IgG1 antibody fragment marketed for intravenous use as VYVGART®  and recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20)  Halozyme’s ENHANZE® drug delivery technology to facilitate subcutaneous injection delivery of biologics. In binding to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)  VYVGART Hytrulo results in the reduction of circulating IgG. It is the first-and-only approved FcRn blocker administered by subcutaneous injection.VYVGART Hytrulo is the proprietary name in the U.S. for subcutaneous efgartigimod alfa and recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20. It may be marketed under different proprietary names following approval in other regions.About argenxargenx is a global immunology company committed to improving the lives of people suffering from severe autoimmune diseases.

More specifically  as part of a policy of self-financed growth through targeted asset disposals  ARGAN aims  by the end of 2026  to reduce its LTV ratio to below 40% (compared with 49.7% at the end of 2023) and that of net debt / EBITDA to approximately 8x (compared with 11x at the end of 2023)  while recording a rental income growth of around 5% per year on average over the period 2024-2026.In its report  S&P notably stated: “The tighter financial policy  sustained cash flow generation  debt amortization  and EBITDA contribution from development will support deleveraging.”. The rating agency also highlighted the “resilient” fundamentals of the French logistics sector  which contribute to stable cash flow outlooks. The rating is available on the S&P Global Ratings website www.standardandpoors.com.ARGAN is thus supported in its strong and proactive deleveraging strategy and its ability to reinforce its “investment grade” status  thus allowing for future refinancing under the best possible conditions  especially by the maturity of its €500 million bond debt in November 2026.Story continues2024 financial calendar (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)March 21: General Assembly 2024April 2: Net sales of 1 st quarter 2024July 1: Net sales of 2 nd quarter 2024July 24: Half-year results 2024October 1: Net sales of 3rd quarter 20242025 financial calendar (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)January 3: Net sales of 4 th quarter 2024January 16: Annual results 2024March 20: General Assembly 2025About ARGANARGAN is the only French real estate company specializing in the DEVELOPMENT & RENTAL OF PREMIUM WAREHOUSES listed on EURONEXT and is the leading player of its market.
