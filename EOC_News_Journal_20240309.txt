DBV is currently focused on investigating the use of its proprietary technology platform  Viaskin™  to address food allergies  which are caused by a hypersensitive immune reaction and characterized by a range of symptoms varying in severity from mild to life-threatening anaphylaxis. Millions of people live with food allergies including young children. Through epicutaneous immunotherapy (EPIT™)  the Viaskin platform is designed to introduce microgram amounts of a biologically active compound to the immune system through intact skin.

The results of the SARA-INT (phase 2) and COVA (phase 3) clinical trials demonstrated the efficacy and safety of RuvembriTM   respectively in sarcopenic patients and those suffering from severe forms of COVID-19. The data collected on these two vulnerable populations confirm the potential of RuvembriTM in the treatment of patients suffering from Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD).RuvembriTM has already obtained the orphan drug designation in Europe and the USA for this indication  which will accelerate clinical development and market authorization procedures. Biophytis aims to start in 2024 a phase 1-2 clinical trial in non-ambulatory DMD patients suffering from respiratory failure.Stanislas Veillet  CEO of Biophytis  stated: ""Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy is a severe orphan condition which generally appears between the ages of 2 and 5 years by progressive muscle weakness  loss of walking capacity and later cardio-respiratory difficulties responsible for the early death of young adults. Despite some recent advances and the great hope generated by gene therapy  there is no satisfactory treatment today and the medical need is still substantial  particularly for non-ambulatory patients.

Over the past three years  the number of women in leadership positions doubled to 30% globally and the Company is well on track to achieve its Dare Forward 2030 commitment. Specifically  while women make up 21% of the global employee base  women make up 24% of the senior vice president and vice president positions globally  with 27% targeted by the end of this year.Additionally  31% of new hires in 2023 were women  rising to 42% for top management positions  and the number of women in manufacturing top management jumped by 15%  further illustrating the Company’s commitment to identifying top female talent to help boost Stellantis’ growth.“Increasing the representation of women in management positions is not only part of our Human Resources strategy  but a cornerstone of our future development ” said Xavier Chéreau  Stellantis Chief Human Resources & Transformation Officer. “It is strengthening the Company’s attractiveness for female profiles through career development opportunities  as well as flexible and remote working arrangements offered by the Company. Thirty percent is a start  and we will go further.”In a sector that historically has under-represented women  the challenge is to attract and develop female talent at all levels in the Company. Stellantis is driving the agenda through many activities across the globe  including leveraging its Women of Stellantis business resource group to deliver important initiatives worldwide.The strategy of developing female talent within Stellantis complements other global diversity and inclusion initiatives undertaken since the Company was founded. Initiatives include leadership training for women  the signature of the United Nations Women’s Empowerment Principles  a training campaign to remove gender bias  and a systematic approach to promote gender balance in recruitment and selection.The FTSE Diversity and Inclusion Index ranks over 12 000 companies globally and identifies the top 100 publicly traded companies with the most diverse and inclusive workplaces  as measured by 24 separate metrics across four key pillars.Ethical responsibility is at the core of Stellantis to ensure a sustainable future of mobility for our customers  our employees and our planet. As part of the CARE pillar in Dare Forward 2030   Stellantis targets to have over 35% of leadership positions held by women by 2030.# # #About StellantisStellantis N.V.

The tender offer  which was initially announced by Tetragon on 4 March 2024   will be conducted as a ""modified Dutch auction"" with shareholders able to tender their Tetragon non-voting shares at prices ranging from and including $9.00 up to and including $10.50 per share. The tender offer is expected to expire at 11:59 p.m. (ET) on 10 April 2024   unless extended or terminated earlier. J.P. Morgan Securities plc (which conducts its U.K. investment banking business as J.P. Morgan Cazenove) will act as dealer manager for the tender offer and Computershare Investor Services PLC will act as tender agent for the tender offer.Eligible shareholders will be able to indicate how many Tetragon non-voting shares and at what price or prices within the specified range they wish to tender. Based on the number of shares tendered and the prices specified by the tendering shareholders  J.P. Morgan  as dealer manager  will determine the lowest price per share within the range that will enable Tetragon to purchase $25 000 000 in value of Tetragon non-voting shares  or a lower amount if the tender offer is not fully subscribed. All shares purchased by Tetragon in the tender offer will be purchased at the same price. If  based on the determined purchase price  more than $25 000 000 in value of shares are properly tendered and not properly withdrawn  valid tenders made below the determined purchase price are expected to be accepted in full  except in the limited circumstances described below  while valid tenders made at the determined purchase price will be subject to proration. However  if the pro rata reduction of the number of shares eligible to be purchased at the determined purchase price is insufficient to reduce the value of the shares to be purchased to $25 000 000   then none of the shares tendered at the determined purchase price will be purchased  and instead there will be a pro rata reduction in the purchase of shares tendered at the next highest price below the determined purchase price to the extent necessary to reduce the value of shares purchased to $25 000 000 . The determined purchase price  as well as the proration factor (if applicable)  is expected to be announced on or 11 April 2024   and Tetragon expects the purchase of shares in the tender offer would be settled promptly thereafter.The tender offer is not conditioned upon the receipt of any minimum number of shares being tendered.This release is for informational purposes only and is neither an offer to buy nor the solicitation of an offer to sell any shares of Tetragon.

The tender offer  which was initially announced by Tetragon on 4 March 2024  will be conducted as a ""modified Dutch auction"" with shareholders able to tender their Tetragon non-voting shares at prices ranging from and including $9.00 up to and including $10.50 per share. The tender offer is expected to expire at 11:59 p.m. (ET) on 10 April 2024  unless extended or terminated earlier. J.P. Morgan Securities plc (which conducts its U.K. investment banking business as J.P. Morgan Cazenove) will act as dealer manager for the tender offer and Computershare Investor Services PLC will act as tender agent for the tender offer.Eligible shareholders will be able to indicate how many Tetragon non-voting shares and at what price or prices within the specified range they wish to tender. Based on the number of shares tendered and the prices specified by the tendering shareholders  J.P. Morgan  as dealer manager  will determine the lowest price per share within the range that will enable Tetragon to purchase $25 000 000 in value of Tetragon non-voting shares  or a lower amount if the tender offer is not fully subscribed. All shares purchased by Tetragon in the tender offer will be purchased at the same price. If  based on the determined purchase price  more than $25 000 000 in value of shares are properly tendered and not properly withdrawn  valid tenders made below the determined purchase price are expected to be accepted in full  except in the limited circumstances described below  while valid tenders made at the determined purchase price will be subject to proration. However  if the pro rata reduction of the number of shares eligible to be purchased at the determined purchase price is insufficient to reduce the value of the shares to be purchased to $25 000 000  then none of the shares tendered at the determined purchase price will be purchased  and instead there will be a pro rata reduction in the purchase of shares tendered at the next highest price below the determined purchase price to the extent necessary to reduce the value of shares purchased to $25 000 000. The determined purchase price  as well as the proration factor (if applicable)  is expected to be announced on or 11 April 2024  and Tetragon expects the purchase of shares in the tender offer would be settled promptly thereafter.The tender offer is not conditioned upon the receipt of any minimum number of shares being tendered.This release is for informational purposes only and is neither an offer to buy nor the solicitation of an offer to sell any shares of Tetragon. The full details of the tender offer  including complete instructions on how to tender shares  are included in the offer to purchase which is available on Tetragon's website at the following URL:https://www.tetragoninv.com/shareholders/share-repurchasesShareholders should read carefully the offer to purchase because it contains important information.

The Consortium restates the fact that it has fully negotiated and signed binding agreements with shareholders representing 71.92% of Believe’s share capital.The Consortium considers that its decision to waive the condition precedent with respect to the reasoned opinion of the Company’s Board of directors on the Offer recommending the shareholders to tender their shares  is perfectly valid and has been done in full compliance with French regulations. This condition was stipulated for the exclusive benefit of the Consortium to enable it  as the case may be  not to proceed with the acquisition if it was unable to take the company private. The purpose of the waiver was to clarify to the market that the acquisition of the blocks is firm and definitive  independent of a board recommendation.The Consortium confirms that it will  after the acquisition of the 71.92% block is completed  file a mandatory tender offer to acquire the remaining 28% free float at the same price of €15 paid to the selling shareholders of the blocks; as required by French tender offer regulation.The Consortium believes that it is best positioned to enable Believe to continue to thrive and develop itself at the service of artists and labels at all stages of their careers.The combined expertise and company knowledge of Denis Ladegaillerie  co-founder and CEO of Believe  TCV which has backed the company since 2014  and EQT  which is Europe's largest private equity firm and has a proven track-record of developing high growth companies  notably in the music industry  makes for a unique solution to support Believe in its development. With the Consortium’s backing  Believe will be able to seize significant opportunities ahead while preserving what makes it unique to the artists and labels it serves globally: an entrepreneurial spirit and a fierce independence.Disclaimer This press release has been prepared for information purposes only.

He said that the scheduling of repairs is also often taking longer.“There are two impacts in terms of accidental damage ” he said. “One is the actual cost of settlement. Typically  that’s gone up by about 17pc in the year. As that cost increases  people are more likely to make a claim. The number of notifications has gone up 11pc.“Previously  people might have decided ‘Oh  I’ll cover that myself  it’s not going to cost much’ ” said Mr O’Midheach. “Now they’re more likely to make a claim for accidental damage.”He said the proportion of accidental damage claims is “really moving up” and the insurer told investors that there remains “considerable upward pressure on constituent costs”.Now they’re more likely to make a claim for accidental damageHowever  Mr O’Midheach pointed out that the personal injuries guidelines have resulted in lower amounts of injuries claims.“They’re countervailing forces now really ” he added.But the increases did little to dent FBD’s results for 2023. The stock market-listed insurer said that its profit after tax last year soared nearly 23pc to €81m. Its combined operating ratio – a key measure of profitability for insurance firms – was 81pc in 2023. A figure above 100 means that an insurance company is paying out more in claims than it is getting in premiums.FBD’s insurance revenue climbed 8pc last year to €401m  while its gross written premiums were 8pc higher at €414m.While there were more named storms in 2023 than in 2022  FBD noted that there were still a “lower number of attritional weather events” last year.Large injury claims  which are for amounts greater than €250 000  that were notified in 2023 were also lower than the average in pre-Covid years.The company saw the number of policies it has with customers increase 2.6pc last year  while average premiums rose 5.4pc. But of that latter rise  4.5 percentage points was a result of increased levels of coverage  primarily as a result of higher property rebuild costs due to construction inflation.FBD – which is listed on Dublin’s Euronext - also confirmed that it is looking at the merits of retaining a listing in London  noting that trading there as a percentage of overall trading volume in its shares has significantly reduced in recent years.FBD chief financial officer Kate Tobin said that the cost of maintaining the listing isn’t high – between €25 000 and €30 000 a year – but that other factors have also prompted the review.“We’ve access through Euronext to a wide variety of investors ” she said. “Over time  and following Brexit  we see greater risk of regulatory divergence.”FBD’s annual report published on Friday also shows that Mr O’Midheach was paid a total of €1.15m last year  compared with almost €1.1m in 2022. His pay last year comprised a basic salary of €530 000 and a €544 000 bonus.,negative,0.01,0.21,0.78,negative,0.01,0.24,0.75,True,English,"['accidental damage', 'FBD', 'claims', 'cars', 'rise', 'Tomás O’Midheach', 'higher property rebuild costs', 'FBD chief financial officer', 'Mr O’Midheach', 'motor repair labour', 'considerable upward pressure', 'combined operating ratio', 'attritional weather events', 'overall trading volume', 'personal injuries guidelines', 'stock market-listed insurer', 'tax last year', 'gross written premiums', 'Large injury claims', 'accidental damage claims', 'chief executive', 'constituent costs', 'Higher cost', 'injuries claims', 'boarder inflation', 'two impacts', 'key measure', 'insurance firms', 'insurance revenue', 'Covid years', 'latter rise', 'construction inflation', 'recent years', 'Kate Tobin', 'other factors', 'wide variety', 'greater risk', 'regulatory divergence', 'annual report', 'basic salary', 'insurer FBD', 'actual cost', 'lower amounts', 'insurance company', 'average premiums', '4.5 percentage points', 'lower number', 'cost increases', 'repairs', 'people', 'insurers', 'Consumers', 'vehicles', 'jump', 'parts', 'paint', 'scheduling', 'terms', 'settlement', '17pc', 'notifications', 'proportion', 'investors', 'forces', 'results', 'profit', 'figure', 'storms', 'policies', 'customers', 'levels', 'coverage', 'Dublin', 'Euronext', 'merits', 'listing', 'London', 'shares', 'review', 'time', 'Brexit', 'Friday', 'total', 'pay', '€544,000 bonus']",2024-03-08,2024-03-09,independent.ie

This marks the completion of patient treatments and the initiation of the data management/reporting phase . On 05 March 2024  Mithra announced the initiation of a monetization process and signing of a new secured bridge loan facility expected to fund that process through 30 April. The monetization process and Facility are further to Mithra’s 06 February 2024 announcement on its cash position. In an effort to maximize value for all of Mithra’s stakeholders  the Company has initiated a monetization process to realize value from its assets involving the sale of various selected assets  particularly Estetra SRL  and/or the business as a whole. The Company is finalizing negotiations with an internationally recognized investment bank to help conduct the Monetization Process in collaboration with DC Advisory and Alvarez & Marsal  who are advising on liquidity management and advising on monetization  among other things. Parties interested in participating in the Monetization Process should contact Ed Kulik of DC Advisory (Ed.Kulik@dcadvisory.com) and Thomas Dillenseger of Alvarez & Marsal (TDillenseger@alvarezandmarsal.com). Management Changes: Appointment of Christophe Maréchal 1 and Xavier Paoli as co-CEOs following  05 March 2024 termination of the management agreement of former CEO.and its plans to address its runway and creating and optimizing value for all its stakeholders on 06 February  2024.Financial resultsNote regarding basis of preparation : The consolidated financial results of Mithra Pharmaceuticals SA and its subsidiaries (“Mithra”) included in this release have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union. These include International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the related interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB)  and the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRIC)  effective at the reporting date and adopted by the European Union.These consolidated financial results have been prepared on the basis of a going concern. However  as announced on 06 February 2024 and 05 March 2024  there are material uncertainties about Mithra's ability to continue in operation beyond 30 April 2024. As of 07 March 2024  Mithra has approximately EUR 9.0 million in cash and cash equivalents including the first drawdown under the bridge facility. Its lenders have provided a committed bridge facility of up to EUR 13.5 million  plus an uncommitted ""accordion"" facility for a further EUR 5 million  in each case subject to milestones  as described in that 05 March 2024 press release  in order to fund a monetization process. However  as noted in that release there is a risk that Mithra will not be able to draw the full amount  for instance if it is not able to initiate a Monetization Process. Even if a Monetization Process is initiated  there is a material risk that that process will not be successful  in whole or in part  or may not significantly reduce Mithra's existing indebtedness. If Mithra is not able to draw funds under the new bridge facility or is otherwise not able to raise or generate sufficient cash  this will adversely affect Mithra's continued operations and ability to operate as a going concern.1.Consolidated statement of profit or lossThousands of euro (€) 2023 2022 Revenue 40 155 66 997 Cost of sales (21 950) (19 623) Gross profit 18 205 47 374 Research and development expenses (63 170) (64 041) General and administrative expenses (22 085) (14 675) Selling expenses (2 271) (2 100) Impairment on non-current assets (74 147) - Other operating income 4 336 7 196 Loss from operations (139 132) (26 245) Change in fair value of contingent consideration payable (1 510) 28 335 Net fair value gains/(losses) on financial assets at fair value through profit or loss - - Financial income 1 745 9 852 Financial expenses (22 899) (23 422) Loss before taxes (161 795) (11 480) Income taxes (11 707) (48 139) NET LOSS FOR THE PERIOD (173 502) (59 620)2.

The main contributor to this difference was an impairment loss of EUR 74.1 million registered on the value of Mithra CDMO and ZORELINE® assets.Revenues were EUR 40.2 million compared with EUR 67.0 million in 2022. The revenues breakdown as follows:Overall product sales of EUR 18.7 million were largely driven by ESTELLE ® (EUR 10.4 million)  which are higher than in 2022 ( EUR 9.2 million) and MYRING ® (EUR 6.0 million) that improves the revenue on our generic portfolio to EUR 8.3 million compared to EUR 6.5 million in 2022.(EUR 10.4 million)  which are higher than in 2022 EUR 9.2 million) and MYRING (EUR 6.0 million) that improves the revenue on our generic portfolio to EUR 8.3 million compared to EUR 6.5 million in 2022. Out-licensing revenue for the year was EUR 19 million from ESTELLE ® and DONESTA ® milestones (EUR 16.3 million and EUR 2.6 million  respectively).For ESTELLE ®   on top of EUR 3.75 million invoiced to our Partner Fuji  another EUR 12.5 million has been recognized as revenue according to our IFRS 15 accounting policy (respectively EUR 2.5 million with Gedeon Richter for China and EUR 10.0 million with Fuji). Balance of out-licencing was primarily for DONESTA ® with EUR 1.5 million invoiced to our partner Searchlight and EUR 1.13 million recognised under IFRS for China and Israel.and DONESTA milestones (EUR 16.3 million and EUR 2.6 million  respectively). For ESTELLE   on top of EUR 3.75 million invoiced to our Partner Fuji  another EUR 12.5 million has been recognized as revenue according to our IFRS 15 accounting policy (respectively EUR 2.5 million with Gedeon Richter for China and EUR 10.0 million with Fuji). Balance of out-licencing was primarily for DONESTA with EUR 1.5 million invoiced to our partner Searchlight and EUR 1.13 million recognised under IFRS for China and Israel. Revenues from the R&D contracting activities of the CDMO were stable at EUR 2.4 million compared to EUR 2.3 million in 2022.R&D expenses (including depreciation) decreased slightly to EUR 63.2 million. The stable level of research expenses is due to the continued focus on our core R&D projects  namely the DONESTA® Phase II and III clinical studies and the ESTELLE® post-approval safety study (PASS).G&A and selling expenses increased +44% to EUR 24.4 million due to a higher impact of share-based payments accounting entries (charge of EUR 4.5 million compared to charge of EUR 2.0 million in 2022); increase in professional services to assist us in our attempt to strengthen our balance sheet and refocus on innovative R&D  but also relating to administration of our financial liabilities and uncomfortable cash position; and  to a lesser extent  an increase in insurance costs and salaries indexation.Impairment on non-current assets: as focus for non-core assets has now shifted to short-term sale or disposal of those assets  an impairment loss of EUR 74.1 million for two such assets has been recorded in FY 2023 financial statements: EUR 47.7 million for Mithra CDMO and EUR 26.4 million for ZORELINE®.Other operating income of EUR 4.3 million (compared to EUR 7.2 million in 2022) mostly consists of an R&D tax credit for EUR 1.3 million which is directly related to R&D expenses level and of EUR 1.4 million exemption from the withholding tax on professional income for R&D staff. Main reason for lower other operating income is that last year included a reinvoicing of costs of EUR 2.2 million that did not repeat in 2023.The negative impact of approximately EUR -1.5 million for change in fair value related to contingent consideration payable ESTELLE® is the consequence of the update of both the discount rate and the timing effect.The decrease in financial income to EUR 1.7 million from EUR 9.9 million in 2022 is explained by the lower impact of the remeasurement of refundable government advances measured at amortized cost following the update of forecasts (EUR 0.5 million in 2023 vs EUR 3.6 million last year). Last year also included EUR 3.0 million of dividend from Mayne Pharma as well as a realized gain of EUR 2.5 million following the early repurchase of EUR 34.1 million tranche of our convertible bonds due in 2025 at a discount to par  via the convertible loan signed with Highbridge Capital Management  LLC (“Highbridge“) and funds managed by Whitebox Advisors  LLC (“Whitebox”).Financial expenses remained stable compared to last year  albeit at a high level. The group recorded a tax loss of EUR -11.7 million for 2023 as the balance of deferred tax assets previously recognised within Mithra CDMO and Novalon have been reversed as essentially relating to expected future taxable profit of ZORELINE® now most likely to be sold in the short term.Statement of financial positionAssetsAs of 31 December 2023  the statement of financial position shows a total of EUR 193.1 million in non-current assets-- the majority of which are other intangible assets (EUR 108.7 million); right-of-use assets (EUR 38.1 million); investments in equity securities (EUR 16.0 million); property  plant and equipment (EUR 13.4 million) and deferred tax assets (EUR 1.3 million).In 2023  new additions to the other intangible assets have been limited to a total of EUR 4.2 million (EUR 33.3 million in 2022) and almost offset by EUR 3.5 million of depreciation. Main change of 2023 was the result of the impairment testing of our CDMO and ZORELINE® that led to a one-time depreciation of EUR 27.0 million (EUR 0.6 million and EUR 26.4 million respectively for the CDMO and ZORELINE®).The same impairment testing also led to a one-time depreciation of EUR -47.2 million on our CDMO Tangible fixed assets (Property  plant and equipment and the right-of-use assets). Otherwise  limited additions during the year (EUR 1.2 million) were more than offset by depreciation of the period (EUR 8.2 million). Deferred tax assets decreased to EUR 1.3 million as balance of deferred tax assets previously recognised within Mithra CDMO and Novalon have been reversed as essentially relating to expected future taxable profit of our complex therapeutics products now most likely to be sold in the short term.Contract assets amount decreased to EUR 19.7 million (non-current and current) versus EUR 47.8 million in 2022. New contract assets recognized (essentially EUR 10 million for Fuji and EUR 3.5 million relating to ESTELLE® & DONESTA® in China) were more than offset by unbilled revenues recognised in prior year(s) and invoiced in 2023 (EUR 40.7 million for Gedeon Richter).Current assets at the end of 2023 are about EUR 93.4 million and include  besides contract assets explained here above  Cash and cash equivalents of EUR 9.0 million  Trade & other receivables of EUR 16.6 million  and Inventories of EUR 48.3 million.Equity and liabilitiesTotal equity at year-end is negative at EUR -103.3 million as the total comprehensive loss for the period (EUR 167.1 million) was only partially compensated by several capital increases for a total amount of EUR 25.6 million (net of transaction costs).Non-current liabilities increased to EUR 285.8 million at the end of 2023  compared to EUR 278.3 million end of 2022. The main changes during the period relate to the access in June 2023 to a new tranche of the amended loan facility concluded with funds managed by Highbridge and Whitebox (“Convertible loans” in the above table) for an amount of EUR 12.5 million and the recognition of a contract liability of EUR 10.3 million with Gedeon Richter for DONESTA®.Current liabilities decreased to EUR 104.0 million at the end of 2023  compared to EUR 130.4 million in 2022. The decrease of the Current liabilities is mainly explained by the reimbursement of straight loans at maturity for an amount of EUR 26.8 million.Alternative performance measuresMithra uses some alternative performance measures (APMs) that are not defined in IFRS but that provide helpful additional information to better assess how the business has performed over the period.

These include International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and the related interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB)  and the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRIC)  effective at the reporting date and adopted by the European Union.These consolidated financial results have been prepared on the basis of a going concern. However  as announced on 06 February 2024 and 05 March 2024  there are material uncertainties about Mithra's ability to continue in operation beyond 30 April 2024. As of 07 March 2024  Mithra has approximately EUR 9.0 million in cash and cash equivalents including the first drawdown under the bridge facility. Its lenders have provided a committed bridge facility of up to EUR 13.5 million  plus an uncommitted ""accordion"" facility for a further EUR 5 million  in each case subject to milestones  as described in that 05 March 2024 press release  in order to fund a monetization process. However  as noted in that release there is a risk that Mithra will not be able to draw the full amount  for instance if it is not able to initiate a Monetization Process. Even if a Monetization Process is initiated  there is a material risk that that process will not be successful  in whole or in part  or may not significantly reduce Mithra's existing indebtedness. If Mithra is not able to draw funds under the new bridge facility or is otherwise not able to raise or generate sufficient cash  this will adversely affect Mithra's continued operations and ability to operate as a going concern.1.Consolidated statement of profit or lossThousands of euro (€) 2023 2022 Revenue 40 155 66 997 Cost of sales (21 950) (19 623) Gross profit 18 205 47 374 Research and development expenses (63 170) (64 041) General and administrative expenses (22 085) (14 675) Selling expenses (2 271) (2 100) Impairment on non-current assets (74 147) - Other operating income 4 336 7 196 Loss from operations (139 132) (26 245) Change in fair value of contingent consideration payable (1 510) 28 335 Net fair value gains/(losses) on financial assets at fair value through profit or loss - - Financial income 1 745 9 852 Financial expenses (22 899) (23 422) Loss before taxes (161 795) (11 480) Income taxes (11 707) (48 139) NET LOSS FOR THE PERIOD (173 502) (59 620)2.

Revenues from the R&D contracting activities of the CDMO were stable at EUR 2.4 million compared to EUR 2.3 million in 2022.R&D expenses (including depreciation) decreased slightly to EUR 63.2 million. The stable level of research expenses is due to the continued focus on our core R&D projects  namely the DONESTA® Phase II and III clinical studies and the ESTELLE® post-approval safety study (PASS).G&A and selling expenses increased +44% to EUR 24.4 million due to a higher impact of share-based payments accounting entries (charge of EUR 4.5 million compared to charge of EUR 2.0 million in 2022); increase in professional services to assist us in our attempt to strengthen our balance sheet and refocus on innovative R&D  but also relating to administration of our financial liabilities and uncomfortable cash position; and  to a lesser extent  an increase in insurance costs and salaries indexation.Impairment on non-current assets: as focus for non-core assets has now shifted to short-term sale or disposal of those assets  an impairment loss of EUR 74.1 million for two such assets has been recorded in FY 2023 financial statements: EUR 47.7 million for Mithra CDMO and EUR 26.4 million for ZORELINE®.Other operating income of EUR 4.3 million (compared to EUR 7.2 million in 2022) mostly consists of an R&D tax credit for EUR 1.3 million which is directly related to R&D expenses level and of EUR 1.4 million exemption from the withholding tax on professional income for R&D staff. Main reason for lower other operating income is that last year included a reinvoicing of costs of EUR 2.2 million that did not repeat in 2023.The negative impact of approximately EUR -1.5 million for change in fair value related to contingent consideration payable ESTELLE® is the consequence of the update of both the discount rate and the timing effect.The decrease in financial income to EUR 1.7 million from EUR 9.9 million in 2022 is explained by the lower impact of the remeasurement of refundable government advances measured at amortized cost following the update of forecasts (EUR 0.5 million in 2023 vs EUR 3.6 million last year). Last year also included EUR 3.0 million of dividend from Mayne Pharma as well as a realized gain of EUR 2.5 million following the early repurchase of EUR 34.1 million tranche of our convertible bonds due in 2025 at a discount to par  via the convertible loan signed with Highbridge Capital Management  LLC (“Highbridge“) and funds managed by Whitebox Advisors  LLC (“Whitebox”).Financial expenses remained stable compared to last year  albeit at a high level. The group recorded a tax loss of EUR -11.7 million for 2023 as the balance of deferred tax assets previously recognised within Mithra CDMO and Novalon have been reversed as essentially relating to expected future taxable profit of ZORELINE® now most likely to be sold in the short term.Statement of financial positionAssetsAs of 31 December 2023  the statement of financial position shows a total of EUR 193.1 million in non-current assets-- the majority of which are other intangible assets (EUR 108.7 million); right-of-use assets (EUR 38.1 million); investments in equity securities (EUR 16.0 million); property  plant and equipment (EUR 13.4 million) and deferred tax assets (EUR 1.3 million).In 2023  new additions to the other intangible assets have been limited to a total of EUR 4.2 million (EUR 33.3 million in 2022) and almost offset by EUR 3.5 million of depreciation. Main change of 2023 was the result of the impairment testing of our CDMO and ZORELINE® that led to a one-time depreciation of EUR 27.0 million (EUR 0.6 million and EUR 26.4 million respectively for the CDMO and ZORELINE®).The same impairment testing also led to a one-time depreciation of EUR -47.2 million on our CDMO Tangible fixed assets (Property  plant and equipment and the right-of-use assets). Otherwise  limited additions during the year (EUR 1.2 million) were more than offset by depreciation of the period (EUR 8.2 million). Deferred tax assets decreased to EUR 1.3 million as balance of deferred tax assets previously recognised within Mithra CDMO and Novalon have been reversed as essentially relating to expected future taxable profit of our complex therapeutics products now most likely to be sold in the short term.Contract assets amount decreased to EUR 19.7 million (non-current and current) versus EUR 47.8 million in 2022. New contract assets recognized (essentially EUR 10 million for Fuji and EUR 3.5 million relating to ESTELLE® & DONESTA® in China) were more than offset by unbilled revenues recognised in prior year(s) and invoiced in 2023 (EUR 40.7 million for Gedeon Richter).Current assets at the end of 2023 are about EUR 93.4 million and include  besides contract assets explained here above  Cash and cash equivalents of EUR 9.0 million  Trade & other receivables of EUR 16.6 million  and Inventories of EUR 48.3 million.Equity and liabilitiesTotal equity at year-end is negative at EUR -103.3 million as the total comprehensive loss for the period (EUR 167.1 million) was only partially compensated by several capital increases for a total amount of EUR 25.6 million (net of transaction costs).Non-current liabilities increased to EUR 285.8 million at the end of 2023  compared to EUR 278.3 million end of 2022. The main changes during the period relate to the access in June 2023 to a new tranche of the amended loan facility concluded with funds managed by Highbridge and Whitebox (“Convertible loans” in the above table) for an amount of EUR 12.5 million and the recognition of a contract liability of EUR 10.3 million with Gedeon Richter for DONESTA®.Current liabilities decreased to EUR 104.0 million at the end of 2023  compared to EUR 130.4 million in 2022. The decrease of the Current liabilities is mainly explained by the reimbursement of straight loans at maturity for an amount of EUR 26.8 million.Alternative performance measuresMithra uses some alternative performance measures (APMs) that are not defined in IFRS but that provide helpful additional information to better assess how the business has performed over the period.
