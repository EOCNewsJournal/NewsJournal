These terms are also used where no useful purpose is served by identifying the particular entity or entities. ‘‘Subsidiaries’’  “Shell subsidiaries” and “Shell companies” as used in this announcement refer to entities over which Shell plc either directly or indirectly has control. Entities and unincorporated arrangements over which Shell has joint control are generally referred to as “joint ventures” and “joint operations”  respectively. “Joint ventures” and “joint operations” are collectively referred to as “joint arrangements”. Entities over which Shell has significant influence but neither control nor joint control are referred to as “associates”. The term “Shell interest” is used for convenience to indicate the direct and/or indirect ownership interest held by Shell in an entity or unincorporated joint arrangement  after exclusion of all third-party interest.Forward-Looking StatementsThis announcement contains forward-looking statements (within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) concerning the financial condition  results of operations and businesses of Shell. All statements other than statements of historical fact are  or may be deemed to be  forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management’s current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking statements include  among other things  statements concerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements expressing management’s expectations  beliefs  estimates  forecasts  projections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as “aim”  “ambition”  ‘‘anticipate’’  ‘‘believe’’  ‘‘could’’  ‘‘estimate’’  ‘‘expect’’  ‘‘goals’’  ‘‘intend’’  ‘‘may’’  “milestones”  ‘‘objectives’’  ‘‘outlook’’  ‘‘plan’’  ‘‘probably’’  ‘‘project’’  ‘‘risks’’  “schedule”  ‘‘seek’’  ‘‘should’’  ‘‘target’’  ‘‘will’’ and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this announcement  including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell’s products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets  and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative  judicial  fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks  including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities  delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics  such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak  regional conflicts  such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine  and a significant cybersecurity breach; and (n) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this announcement are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc’s Form 20-F for the year ended December 31  2022 (available at www.shell.com/investors/news-and-filings/sec-filings.html and www.sec.gov). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this announcement and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement  March 11  2024. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information  future events or other information. In light of these risks  results could differ materially from those stated  implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this announcement.Shell’s net carbon intensityAlso  in this announcement we may refer to Shell’s “Net Carbon Intensity”  which includes Shell’s carbon emissions from the production of our energy products  our suppliers’ carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers’ carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the term Shell’s “Net Carbon Intensity” is for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries.Shell’s net-Zero Emissions TargetShell’s operating plan  outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly  they reflect our Scope 1  Scope 2 and Net Carbon Intensity (NCI) targets over the next ten years. However  Shell’s operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target and 2035 NCI target  as these targets are currently outside our planning period. In the future  as society moves towards net-zero emissions  we expect Shell’s operating plans to reflect this movement. However  if society is not net zero in 2050  as of today  there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.Shell expects to publish its 2024 Energy Transition Strategy on March 14  2024  which will include an update on Shell’s energy transition strategy and sets out Shell’s climate targets and ambitions for the future.Forward Looking Non-GAAP measuresThis announcement may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as cash capital expenditure and divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell  such as oil and gas prices  interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover  estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc’s consolidated financial statements.The contents of websites referred to in this announcement do not form part of this announcement.We may have used certain terms  such as resources  in this announcement that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC.

This unexpected improvement in the placebo group complicated the interpretation of the results based on this endpoint.However  other data from PREMIER suggested no deterioration in the condition of patients under treatment  which is a positive sign in the context of a degenerative disease such as CMT1A. In the meantime  the trial reaffirmed the high safety profile of the treatment already established in all previous studies. This safety profile is crucial for the treatment of a chronic disease such as CMT1A.In addition  pre-specified subgroup analyses of the PREMIER trial suggested an efficacy signal  including a better response in treated patients with a body mass index (BMI) of less than 25  or in patients under 45 years of age.Finally  analysis of the data revealed that  while the study as a whole was indeed randomized into two arms (PXT3003 and placebo)  the distribution of the two treatments within each clinical investigation center was not balanced  contrary to what is normally expected. This major factor may have had a significant impact on the study results.The Company has therefore contested invoices issued by the contract research organization (CRO) mandated by Pharnext to conduct PREMIER trial  and further actions including legal action are envisaged.Beyond this  the Company confirms  as announced on February 28  it is waiting for the upcoming results (by summer 2024) from the Phase III trial currently being conducted in China by partner Tasly (through a joint venture owned 30% by Pharnext) which acquired the licensing rights for PXT3003 in China in 2017  with 2 options:If results from the study in China are negative  Pharnext will analyze these results and draw the necessary conclusions in conjunction with the Company's shareholders.If results from the study in China are positive  showing a statistically significant benefit of PXT3003  Pharnext will continue its dialogue with the FDA and EMA to agree on a registration process for PXT3003 in CMT1A.Given available data and the favorable outlook if results from the study conducted in China are positive  the Company considers it has sufficient satisfactory elements to maintain its operations  at least until receipt of the said results.UPDATE ON NEGOTIATIONS VALUING PXT3003 OPERATING RIGHTSAs announced on November 27  2023[4]  the Company decided to wait for the publication of PREMIER topline results before signing an exclusivity agreement with one of the candidate pharmaceuticals  and valuing PXT3003. At that time  the Company had received 3 main offers  including 1 binding and 2 non-binding  from pharmaceutical companies.To date  the 3 main candidates are still waiting for final conclusions from the ongoing analyses as well as topline results from the study conducted in China  and none of them has formally declared withdrawal from the process. Even more  working meetings are being scheduled with some candidates to analyze available data. The Company hopes these candidates will be able to update their position in terms of intent and valuation.UPDATE ON CASH CONSUMPTION AND COST REDUCTION PLANIn this context  as announced on January 17  2024[5]  the Company embarked on a drastic cost-cutting plan with the aim of reducing cash consumption from operating expenses from an average of €2.0m per month in S1 2023 to an average of €0.5-0.9m per month in S1 2024.In February 2024  cash consumption by operations was €0.57m.If results from the study in China are positive  the Company will be able to reactivate some of its expenses  with a relaunch budget estimated at €1.0-1.5m per month and a view to submitting PXT3003 for registration in CMT1A by the FDA and EMA. In this case  the Company plans to pass on all or part of these additional costs to candidates for PXT3003 rights.As announced on February 15  2024[6]  the Company is working to align its financial resources and commitments with main partners. These discussions have been initiated within the framework of a confidential conciliation procedure opened under the aegis of the Paris Commercial Court at the Company's request.UPDATE ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL STRUCTUREOn March 8  2024  the Company had cash of €0.184m and theoretical capacities of €11.9m under the financing agreement with Global Tech Opportunities 13.In addition to the cash burn described above  the Company's main commitments are as follows:Gross financial debt of €6m mainly comprising the cash agreement between Néovacs and Pharnext (€3m) and the bonds subscribed by Global Tech Opportunities 13 not yet converted into shares (€3m); debts not repayable in cash in the short term;Trade payables of around €7m  mainly comprising invoices issued by clinical trial partners.Around 30% of these debts (by value) are currently being contested by Pharnext  and the conciliation process currently underway aims to renegotiate the amount and maturity of debts borne by the Company. Several of the Company's major creditors  already representing more than 50% of debts (by value) and expected to rise to nearly 80% in the next few weeks  agreed to suspend the payment of their debts  if necessary  pending results from the study in China  which reinforces the principle of going concern in the short term.The Company will provide regular updates on the subject.UPDATE ON THE SHAREHOLDERS' MEETING TO BE HELD ON FEBRUARY 15  2024On February 15  2024  the Company's shareholders were convened for a general meeting to discuss the Company's situation and outlooks. As part of discussions  shareholders received the special report issued by the Company's statutory auditors  who warned of their uncertainties regarding the Company's ability to continue as a going concern[7]  as well as the management's responses.The shareholders' meeting could not validly be held for lack of a quorum  and the conciliation procedure in progress has the effect of suspending the alert procedure initiated by statutory auditors. There are therefore no plans to reconvene the meeting in the short term.UPDATE ON THE NEXT STEPS IN THE CONCILIATION PROCESSThe current conciliation procedure is open for a period of 3 months  i.e. until May 15  2024  with a possible extension of 1 month  which should enable the Company to maintain its activities until data from the PREMIER trial are fully analyzed and  above all  until topline results from the study in China are issued.This period should give the Company time to restructure its liabilities and prepare for the next steps post-announcement of these results.UPDATE ON PHARNEXT SHARE LISTINGThe Company asked Euronext to suspend the listing of its shares with effect from March 6  2024  pending publication of this press release.The Company therefore applied to Euronext to resume trading in its shares from the session of March 12  and will continue to inform the market on a regular basis as part of its periodic and ongoing information obligations. In this respect  Pharnext aims to publish its 2023 financial statements by April 30  2024  at the latest.Hugo Brugière  Manager of Pharnext  said: ""We have heard requests for a full update on our latest announcements and the situation to date regarding results from clinical trials  discussions with partners  financial situation and next steps.The horizon is clearly set  and results from the study conducted in China will be a turning point for Pharnext. If they are positive  we will once again have the opportunity to create a great deal of value. If they are negative  we will decide with the Company's shareholders what we want to do.""DisclaimerPharnext arranged (I) financing in the form of convertible bonds financing (OCEAN-BSA) with Global Tech Opportunities 13 which  after receiving the shares resulting from the conversion or exercise of these instruments  will not remain shareholder of the Company  and (II) financing in OS bonds which were subsequently transferred to a trust  which is now responsible for their equitization.The shares resulting from the conversion or exercise of the above-mentioned securities will generally be sold on the market at very short notice  which may create strong downward pressure on the share price. In the specific case of the trust  the shares are sold on the market in accordance with the terms set out in the trust agreement.Shareholders may suffer a loss of their invested capital due to a significant fall in the Company's share price  as well as significant dilution due to the large number of securities issued to Global Tech Opportunities 13 and/or the trust.Investors are advised to exercise extreme caution before deciding to invest in the securities of a listed company that carries out such dilutive financing transactions  particularly when they are carried out in succession.

In this respect  Pharnext aims to publish its 2023 financial statements by April 30  2024  at the latest.,"11/03/2024 - 16:30PARIS  France  March 11  2024  04:30 pm CET – Pharnext SA ( FR001400N1P4 - ALPHA) (the “Company”)  an advanced late-clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases with high unmet medical need  provides a comprehensive overview of operational  strategic and financial issues following recent announcements.UPDATE ON CLINICAL TRIAL RESULTSAs indicated in press releases on December 11  2023[1]  December 19  2023[2] and February 28  2024[3]  data from the pivotal Phase III trial (PREMIER trial) of PXT3003  its drug candidate in Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A (CMT1A) disease  require refine analysis which is still ongoing.As a reminder  on the primary efficacy endpoint of the PREMIER trial  the Overall Neuropathy Limitation Scale (ONLS)  which measures functional motor disability  patients with mild to moderate CMT1A experienced improvement on both treatment and placebo  rather than the slow deterioration typical of CMT1A's natural progression. This unexpected improvement in the placebo group complicated the interpretation of the results based on this endpoint.However  other data from PREMIER suggested no deterioration in the condition of patients under treatment  which is a positive sign in the context of a degenerative disease such as CMT1A. In the meantime  the trial reaffirmed the high safety profile of the treatment already established in all previous studies. This safety profile is crucial for the treatment of a chronic disease such as CMT1A.In addition  pre-specified subgroup analyses of the PREMIER trial suggested an efficacy signal  including a better response in treated patients with a body mass index (BMI) of less than 25  or in patients under 45 years of age.Finally  analysis of the data revealed that  while the study as a whole was indeed randomized into two arms (PXT3003 and placebo)  the distribution of the two treatments within each clinical investigation center was not balanced  contrary to what is normally expected. This major factor may have had a significant impact on the study results.The Company has therefore contested invoices issued by the contract research organization (CRO) mandated by Pharnext to conduct PREMIER trial  and further actions including legal action are envisaged.Beyond this  the Company confirms  as announced on February 28  it is waiting for the upcoming results (by summer 2024) from the Phase III trial currently being conducted in China by partner Tasly (through a joint venture owned 30% by Pharnext) which acquired the licensing rights for PXT3003 in China in 2017  with 2 options:If results from the study in China are negative  Pharnext will analyze these results and draw the necessary conclusions in conjunction with the Company's shareholders.If results from the study in China are positive  showing a statistically significant benefit of PXT3003  Pharnext will continue its dialogue with the FDA and EMA to agree on a registration process for PXT3003 in CMT1A.Given available data and the favorable outlook if results from the study conducted in China are positive  the Company considers it has sufficient satisfactory elements to maintain its operations  at least until receipt of the said results.UPDATE ON NEGOTIATIONS VALUING PXT3003 OPERATING RIGHTSAs announced on November 27  2023[4]  the Company decided to wait for the publication of PREMIER topline results before signing an exclusivity agreement with one of the candidate pharmaceuticals  and valuing PXT3003. At that time  the Company had received 3 main offers  including 1 binding and 2 non-binding  from pharmaceutical companies.To date  the 3 main candidates are still waiting for final conclusions from the ongoing analyses as well as topline results from the study conducted in China  and none of them has formally declared withdrawal from the process. Even more  working meetings are being scheduled with some candidates to analyze available data. The Company hopes these candidates will be able to update their position in terms of intent and valuation.UPDATE ON CASH CONSUMPTION AND COST REDUCTION PLANIn this context  as announced on January 17  2024[5]  the Company embarked on a drastic cost-cutting plan with the aim of reducing cash consumption from operating expenses from an average of €2.0m per month in S1 2023 to an average of €0.5-0.9m per month in S1 2024.In February 2024  cash consumption by operations was €0.57m.If results from the study in China are positive  the Company will be able to reactivate some of its expenses  with a relaunch budget estimated at €1.0-1.5m per month and a view to submitting PXT3003 for registration in CMT1A by the FDA and EMA. In this case  the Company plans to pass on all or part of these additional costs to candidates for PXT3003 rights.As announced on February 15  2024[6]  the Company is working to align its financial resources and commitments with main partners. These discussions have been initiated within the framework of a confidential conciliation procedure opened under the aegis of the Paris Commercial Court at the Company's request.UPDATE ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL STRUCTUREOn March 8  2024  the Company had cash of €0.184m and theoretical capacities of €11.9m under the financing agreement with Global Tech Opportunities 13.In addition to the cash burn described above  the Company's main commitments are as follows:Gross financial debt of €6m mainly comprising the cash agreement between Néovacs and Pharnext (€3m) and the bonds subscribed by Global Tech Opportunities 13 not yet converted into shares (€3m); debts not repayable in cash in the short term;Trade payables of around €7m  mainly comprising invoices issued by clinical trial partners.Around 30% of these debts (by value) are currently being contested by Pharnext  and the conciliation process currently underway aims to renegotiate the amount and maturity of debts borne by the Company. Several of the Company's major creditors  already representing more than 50% of debts (by value) and expected to rise to nearly 80% in the next few weeks  agreed to suspend the payment of their debts  if necessary  pending results from the study in China  which reinforces the principle of going concern in the short term.The Company will provide regular updates on the subject.UPDATE ON THE SHAREHOLDERS' MEETING TO BE HELD ON FEBRUARY 15  2024On February 15  2024  the Company's shareholders were convened for a general meeting to discuss the Company's situation and outlooks. As part of discussions  shareholders received the special report issued by the Company's statutory auditors  who warned of their uncertainties regarding the Company's ability to continue as a going concern[7]  as well as the management's responses.The shareholders' meeting could not validly be held for lack of a quorum  and the conciliation procedure in progress has the effect of suspending the alert procedure initiated by statutory auditors. There are therefore no plans to reconvene the meeting in the short term.UPDATE ON THE NEXT STEPS IN THE CONCILIATION PROCESSThe current conciliation procedure is open for a period of 3 months  i.e. until May 15  2024  with a possible extension of 1 month  which should enable the Company to maintain its activities until data from the PREMIER trial are fully analyzed and  above all  until topline results from the study in China are issued.This period should give the Company time to restructure its liabilities and prepare for the next steps post-announcement of these results.UPDATE ON PHARNEXT SHARE LISTINGThe Company asked Euronext to suspend the listing of its shares with effect from March 6  2024  pending publication of this press release.The Company therefore applied to Euronext to resume trading in its shares from the session of March 12  and will continue to inform the market on a regular basis as part of its periodic and ongoing information obligations. In this respect  Pharnext aims to publish its 2023 financial statements by April 30  2024  at the latest.Hugo Brugière  Manager of Pharnext  said: “We have heard requests for a full update on our latest announcements and the situation to date regarding results from clinical trials  discussions with partners  financial situation and next steps.The horizon is clearly set  and results from the study conducted in China will be a turning point for Pharnext. If they are positive  we will once again have the opportunity to create a great deal of value. If they are negative  we will decide with the Company's shareholders what we want to do.""DisclaimerPharnext arranged (I) financing in the form of convertible bonds financing (OCEAN-BSA) with Global Tech Opportunities 13 which  after receiving the shares resulting from the conversion or exercise of these instruments  will not remain shareholder of the Company  and (II) financing in OS bonds which were subsequently transferred to a trust  which is now responsible for their equitization.The shares resulting from the conversion or exercise of the above-mentioned securities will generally be sold on the market at very short notice  which may create strong downward pressure on the share price. In the specific case of the trust  the shares are sold on the market in accordance with the terms set out in the trust agreement.Shareholders may suffer a loss of their invested capital due to a significant fall in the Company's share price  as well as significant dilution due to the large number of securities issued to Global Tech Opportunities 13 and/or the trust.Investors are advised to exercise extreme caution before deciding to invest in the securities of a listed company that carries out such dilutive financing transactions  particularly when they are carried out in succession. The Company wishes to point out that this is not the first dilutive financing transaction it has undertaken.About PharnextPharnext is an advanced clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapies for neurodegenerative diseases currently without satisfactory therapeutic solutions.
