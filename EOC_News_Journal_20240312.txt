37249,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://dailyreckoning.com/golds-got-the-midas-touch-back/,Gold’s Got the Midas Touch Back,This post Gold’s Got the Midas Touch Back appeared first on Daily Reckoning.Why Now?The post Gold’s Got the Midas Touch Back appeared first on Daily Reckoning.,Gold’s Got the Midas Touch BackAfter two years of trading in a 20% range between $1 600 and $2 000 per ounce  gold finally broke out to the upside  closing at a new all-time high of $2 126 per ounce on March 4.Better yet  if you’re a gold investor  gold has held its ground around $2 100 per ounce since breaking that ceiling (gold’s trading at around $2 187 today).The price is volatile  but gold broke even higher on March 5 when it hit $2 140 on an intra-day basis. Before getting too euphoric  gold investors should recall that the $800 per ounce record set in January 1980 during borderline hyperinflation would be $3 200 per ounce in today’s dollars if adjusted for inflation.That can be a splash of cold water in the face. On the other hand  it’s highly encouraging. If gold is in a new bull market  $3 200 per ounce looks more like a price target than an insurmountable hurdle.But I continually remind gold investors  whether in bullion or mining shares  not to get too euphoric when gold rallies and not to get too depressed when the dollar price retreats. Gold is still the best form of money and proves valuable to investors over time.What’s Behind the Gold Rally? Will It Last?The bigger questions are: What are the factors driving gold higher  and will they continue the trend?Some of the factors are clear. Central banks have been net buyers of gold since 2010 after being net sellers from 1970–2009. Mining output has been flat for the past eight years; it’s not shrinking but it’s not expanding either.That combination of strong demand from central banks and flat output from mining is a recipe for higher prices and a de facto floor. Some analysts point to potentially lower interest rates as a driver of higher gold prices since fixed-income instruments compete with gold (which has no yield) for investor dollars.It seems likely that the most powerful driver is the one getting the least attention.Outright Theft!At the start of the war in Ukraine  the U.S. froze about $300 billion of U.S. Treasury securities lawfully purchased by the Russian Federation.Legally  those securities are still owned by Russia  but they cannot be sold  traded  transferred or used as collateral. (By the way  this is easy to do because all Treasury securities are held in digital form by custodians on a ledger ultimately controlled by the U.S. Treasury.)Now the U.S. is trying to seize those securities. This is outright theft. Such theft is contrary to numerous provisions of domestic and international law  but the U.S. is pushing the main custodian of those securities  Euroclear in Belgium  and European banks to amend their laws or ignore them for this purpose.Other countries are watching. China  South Korea  Japan  Saudi Arabia  Taiwan and other nations have hundreds of billions of dollars each in U.S. Treasuries in their reserve positions.Watching what the U.S. is doing to Russia is causing those countries to consider alternatives to Treasuries. That’s easier said than done. If U.S. Treasuries are in danger of being stolen  it’s not clear euro- or yen-denominated securities are any safer.Gold is the liquid  safe alternative and appeals to many investors in a world where Treasuries can be confiscated at will.$15 000 Gold?I’ve frequently forecast that gold will reach $15 000 per ounce by 2026 or sooner. That was never a guess or something I said to get attention; it was the result of rigorous analysis based on prior bull markets in gold.There’s never a guarantee that a particular outcome will prevail  but this gold price forecast is based on the best available tools and models that have proved accurate in many other contexts.This is a good time to explain exactly how that $15 000 price forecast emerged.For a technical model  we turn to the two prior bull markets in gold and compare those to the performance of the current bull market.The first bull market in gold ran from August 1971 to January 1980. The dollar price of gold rallied from $35 per ounce to $800 per ounce. That’s a 2 200% gain in 8.4 years.The Second Bull MarketThe second bull market in gold ran from August 1999 to August 2011. The dollar price of gold rallied from $250 per ounce to $1 900 per ounce. That’s a 670% gain in 12 years.Of course  the period after 1980 was a long bear market that lasted 19 years and saw the dollar price of gold drop 68%. The period from August 2011 to December 2015 was another bear market lasting 4.3 years that saw the dollar price of gold drop 45%.I’m not ignoring those. It’s simply the case that we’re in a new gold bull market now  so prior bull market behavior is the right reference frame for predictive analytics.Another question is why do I begin my bull/bear market analysis in 1971? Gold has been money throughout the history of civilization and has been minted in the form of gold coins since at least the sixth century B.C.The answer is that prior to 1971 either gold was money (in which case there is no other “money” to compare it to; gold was valued by weight  not exchange rates)  or the world was on a gold standard in which the money price of gold was fixed (albeit with suspensions of convertibility during wars and periodic breaks due to devaluations).In a world in which gold is money or gold’s value is fixed by law  there are no bull or bear markets  although there can be inflation or deflation.The Third Bull MarketThe third bull market in gold began on Dec. 16  2015  with gold hitting a bottom of $1 050 per ounce at the end of the prior bear market. Since then  gold has rallied to about $2 187 per ounce as of today.If we take a simple average of the price gains and durations of the two prior bull markets in gold  we arrive at a 1 435% gain over a period of 10.2 years.Applying that gain and duration to a baseline of $1 050 per ounce beginning in December 2015 leads to a gains projection for this bull market of $15 070 per ounce by August 2026.There’s nothing deterministic about this model. Actual gains could run ahead of this projection both in time and by amount. Conversely  the bull market could end anytime for a wide variety of reasons.The prior bull market gains could be annualized to produce a slightly lower average gain per year. Still  the bull market assumptions are moderate since I’ve taken a simple average and not stretched for the higher gain or the shorter duration of the two.Again  using the history of gold bull markets as a guide  a dollar price of gold of $15 000 per ounce in under three years is really not that big a stretch.,neutral,0.19,0.8,0.01,mixed,0.31,0.25,0.44,True,English,"['Midas Touch', 'Gold', 'prior bull market behavior', 'The Second Bull Market', 'two prior bull markets', 'new gold bull market', 'U.S. Treasury securities', 'current bull market', 'first bull market', 'new bull market', 'de facto floor', 'liquid, safe alternative', 'right reference frame', 'long bear market', 'bull/bear market analysis', 'best available tools', 'many other contexts', 'past eight years', 'U.S. Treasuries', 'higher gold prices', 'gold price forecast', 'higher prices', 'two years', 'rigorous analysis', 'many investors', 'other hand', 'other nations', 'best form', 'Midas Touch', 'intra-day basis', 'borderline hyperinflation', 'cold water', 'insurmountable hurdle', 'bigger questions', 'Central banks', 'net buyers', 'net sellers', 'strong demand', 'flat output', 'interest rates', 'fixed-income instruments', 'Outright Theft', 'Russian Federation', 'Such theft', 'numerous provisions', 'international law', 'main custodian', 'European banks', 'South Korea', 'Saudi Arabia', 'reserve positions', 'particular outcome', 'technical model', 'predictive analytics', 'sixth century', 'B.C.', 'exchange rates', 'price target', 'dollar price', 'yen-denominated securities', 'Other countries', 'time high', 'mining shares', 'Mining output', 'digital form', 'good time', 'powerful driver', 'other “money', 'gold investor', 'gold rallies', 'Gold Rally', 'gold coins', 'gold standa', 'investor dollars', 'ounce record', '$15,000 price', '8.4 years', '12 years', '19 years', '20% range', 'upside', 'March', 'ground', 'ceiling', 'January', 'today', 'splash', 'face', 'bullion', 'factors', 'trend', 'combination', 'recipe', 'analysts', 'yield', 'attention', 'start', 'war', 'Ukraine', 'collateral', 'way', 'custodians', 'ledger', 'domestic', 'Euroclear', 'Belgium', 'laws', 'purpose', 'China', 'Japan', 'Taiwan', 'hundreds', 'billions', 'alternatives', 'danger', 'appeals', 'world', 'will', 'guess', 'something', 'result', 'guarantee', 'models', 'performance', 'August', '2,200% gain', '670% gain', 'period', 'December', 'case', 'history', 'civilization', 'answer', 'weight', '$800']",2024-03-11,2024-03-12,dailyreckoning.com

The amendment allows Vestum greater flexibility to take up credit facilities  as the current limit in the bond terms and conditions is raised from SEK 1 400 million to SEK 1 800 million  which means that Vestum can refinance its outstanding bonds 2021/2024 (ISIN: SE0016844526) of SEK 900 million (the ""Bonds 21/24"") with bank financing and cash and cash equivalents.BackgroundVestum has received positive credit approvals from lenders and are finalising documentation to increase the existing framework of its credit facilities from initially SEK 1 200 million to SEK 1 800 million. The expanded capacity  along with cash and cash equivalents  is deemed sufficient to refinance the Bonds 21/24. The increase in framework results in a more efficient capital structure with a significantly higher proportion of bank financing than before  which means financing on more favourable terms. The refinancing also means that no credit facilities or bonds mature in 2024 or 2025. To implement this  Vestum requests a change in the terms of the Bonds 23/26.ProcessIn order to amend the terms and conditions of the Bonds 23/26  Vestum has today instructed the agent  Nordic Trustee & Agency AB (publ) (the ""Agent"")  to initiate a written procedure (the ""Written Procedure"") by sending a notice to the directly registered owners and registered nominees of the Bonds 23/26 in Vestum's debt ledger held with Euroclear Sweden as per 8 March 2024. The notice of the Written Procedure is held available on Vestum's and the Agent's web pages  and is attached to this announcement  and has been prepared in accordance with clause 16.3 (Written Procedure) of the terms and conditions of the Bonds 23/26.The outcome of the Written Procedure will be announced by way of press release in connection with the termination of the Written Procedure. The voting record date is 18 March 2024 and the voting deadline expires at 15:00 CET on 28 March 2024.As of the date hereof  a number of larger holders of Bonds 23/26  including the largest bondholder  have committed to vote in favour of the requested amendment.Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB (publ) (""SEB"") has been appointed solicitation agent and Gernandt & Danielsson Advokatbyrå as legal advisor in relation to the Written Procedure.

Deviations from the guidelines The Board of Directors shall be entitled to deviate from the guidelines  for example with respect to recruitments of senior executives on the global labor market to be able to offer competitive terms and conditions  in an individual case if there are special reasons for it and a deviation is necessary to ensure the Company's long term interests and sustainability or to ensure the Company's economic viability.In connection with business acquisitions the sellers may become employed by the Company or one of its subsidiaries. Parts of the purchase price in such situations can be structured so that these occur after the closing date of the transaction. This means that employees of the Company or one of its subsidiaries may receive compensation as a result of business acquisitions that deviate from the guidelines in this document. These compensations refer to the employee's role as a seller in the transaction  and not as an employee.

Compliance with guidelines shall annually be controlled through such as collection of documented annual targets for short-term variable pay. The results of the controls are summarized and reported to the remuneration committee. Presentation of the Board of Directors's remuneration report for approval (item 15) The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting approves the remuneration report. Resolution on authorisation for the Board of Directors to issue shares etc. (item 16) The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to  during the period until the next Annual General Meeting  authorize the Board of Directors to  on one or more occasions  with or without deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  resolve to issue new shares of Class A and/or issue convertibles convertible into Class A shares and/or issue warrants entitling to subscription of Class A shares. by non-cash consideration  by set-off and/or on other terms. If the Board of Directors resolves to issue shares with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  the reason for this shall be to enable payment through own financial instruments in connection with any acquisitions that the Company may make and to enable capital to be raised in connection with and for the purpose of financing such acquisitions. The number of shares that may be issued  the number of shares that convertibles may be converted into and the number of shares that may be subscribed for through the exercise of warrants may not exceed ten (10) per cent of the Company's share capital at the time of the first exercise of the authorisation. The Chairman of Board or the CEO shall be authorised to make any minor adjustments required to register the resolution above with the Swedish Companies Registration Office or Euroclear Sweden AB. Resolution on authorisation for Board of Directors to repurchase and transfer the Company's own shares (item 17) The Board of Directors proposes that the general meeting authorises the board to  until the next Annual General Meeting  on one or several occasions  acquire its own shares. Purchases may be made up to a maximum number of shares that the Company's holding of own shares corresponds to no more than one tenth (1/10) of all shares in the Company. The shares may be acquired through offers to all shareholders or through trading on the Nasdaq Stockholm. If purchased on the Nasdaq Stockholm the price will correspond to the market price at the time of the acquisition with a deviation that does not exceed the registered price interval on each occasion. The main reason for possible purchases is to give the Company flexibility regarding its equity and thereby optimize the capital structure of the Company. Possible purchases may also enable own shares to be used as payment for  or financing of  acquisitions of companies and to be able to fulfil undertakings in accordance with future incentive programmes. The Board of Directors also proposes that the general meeting authorises the board to  on one or several occasions  until the next Annual General Meeting  transfer its own shares owned by the Company at the time of the Board of Directors' decision. The shares may be acquired through trading on the Nasdaq Stockholm at the registered price interval on each occasion.

In this announcement “Shell”  “Shell Group” and “Group” are sometimes used for convenience where references are made to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general. Likewise  the words “we”  “us” and “our” are also used to refer to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general or to those who work for them. These terms are also used where no useful purpose is served by identifying the particular entity or entities. ‘‘Subsidiaries’’  “Shell subsidiaries” and “Shell companies” as used in this announcement refer to entities over which Shell plc either directly or indirectly has control. Entities and unincorporated arrangements over which Shell has joint control are generally referred to as “joint ventures” and “joint operations”  respectively. “Joint ventures” and “joint operations” are collectively referred to as “joint arrangements”. Entities over which Shell has significant influence but neither control nor joint control are referred to as “associates”. The term “Shell interest” is used for convenience to indicate the direct and/or indirect ownership interest held by Shell in an entity or unincorporated joint arrangement  after exclusion of all third-party interest.Forward-Looking StatementsThis announcement contains forward-looking statements (within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) concerning the financial condition  results of operations and businesses of Shell. All statements other than statements of historical fact are  or may be deemed to be  forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management’s current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking statements include  among other things  statements concerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements expressing management’s expectations  beliefs  estimates  forecasts  projections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as “aim”  “ambition”  ‘‘anticipate’’  ‘‘believe’’  ‘‘could’’  ‘‘estimate’’  ‘‘expect’’  ‘‘goals’’  ‘‘intend’’  ‘‘may’’  “milestones”  ‘‘objectives’’  ‘‘outlook’’  ‘‘plan’’  ‘‘probably’’  ‘‘project’’  ‘‘risks’’  “schedule”  ‘‘seek’’  ‘‘should’’  ‘‘target’’  ‘‘will’’ and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this announcement  including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell’s products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets  and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative  judicial  fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks  including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities  delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics  such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak  regional conflicts  such as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine  and a significant cybersecurity breach; and (n) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this announcement are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc’s Form 20-F for the year ended December 31  2022 (available at www.shell.com/investors/news-and-filings/sec-filings.html and www.sec.gov). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this announcement and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement  March 11  2024. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information  future events or other information. In light of these risks  results could differ materially from those stated  implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this announcement.Shell’s net carbon intensityAlso  in this announcement we may refer to Shell’s “Net Carbon Intensity”  which includes Shell’s carbon emissions from the production of our energy products  our suppliers’ carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers’ carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the term Shell’s “Net Carbon Intensity” is for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries.Shell’s net-Zero Emissions TargetShell’s operating plan  outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly  they reflect our Scope 1  Scope 2 and Net Carbon Intensity (NCI) targets over the next ten years. However  Shell’s operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target and 2035 NCI target  as these targets are currently outside our planning period. In the future  as society moves towards net-zero emissions  we expect Shell’s operating plans to reflect this movement. However  if society is not net zero in 2050  as of today  there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.Shell expects to publish its 2024 Energy Transition Strategy on March 14  2024  which will include an update on Shell’s energy transition strategy and sets out Shell’s climate targets and ambitions for the future.Forward Looking Non-GAAP measuresThis announcement may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as cash capital expenditure and divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell  such as oil and gas prices  interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover  estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc’s consolidated financial statements.The contents of websites referred to in this announcement do not form part of this announcement.We may have used certain terms  such as resources  in this announcement that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC.

That plan will be discussed at a summit in Brussels March 21-22  according to a draft of the conclusions seen by Bloomberg.Western nations have frozen about €260 billion ($284 billion) in securities and cash  more than two-thirds of it in the European Union. The EU expects to generate around €3 billion per year from these frozen assets  other people said  who spoke on the condition of anonymity.“We have the legal clarity and conditions to allow the use of these revenues to support Ukraine ” EU trade chief Valdis Dombrovskis said on Tuesday. “We are fully committed to moving forward with the next step: to allow redirecting these revenues to the EU budget for the benefit of Ukraine.”Countries including Ireland  Malta and Luxembourg have said the plan — in particular the intention to use the funds to purchase weapons — deserved a more thorough analysis  said the people. Hungary stressed that the revenue should be allocated to Ukraine’s reconstruction.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen first proposed the idea of using the funds to purchase military equipment last month. The commission then discussed the proposal with member states last week  according to the people.Most of the Russian central bank assets are held in Euroclear  a Brussels-based clearing house that invests that money which may earn as much as €15 billion to €20 billion until 2027  one of the people said. Belgium applies a 25% corporate tax to the profit  which may earn €1.7 billion this year.Western allies generally agree that the frozen Russian funds should remain off-limits to Moscow unless it pledges to help with Ukraine’s reconstruction. But they’re at odds over whether it’s lawful to seize the assets outright — so the challenge for the EU is to squeeze funds out without depleting them.France and Germany  along with the European Central Bank  have expressed the most caution.

37256,Euroclear,Bing API,https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/explained-how-west-can-use-russias-frozen-funds-to-support-ukraine-5226994,Explained: How West Can Use Russia's Frozen Funds To Support Ukraine,Western officials are edging toward confiscating some of the $300-350 billion worth of frozen Russian financial assets to help support Ukraine  but how it will be done remains highly complex given it would set a contested precedent.,"There is the risk that Russia could  through court action  try and seize Euroclear cash.Western officials are edging toward confiscating some of the $300-350 billion worth of frozen Russian financial assets to help support Ukraine  but how it will be done remains highly complex given it would set a contested precedent.Here are some of the ideas that have been suggested:ConfiscationSome international policymakers and lawyers say the immobilised Russian reserves can simply be confiscated under a doctrine of international law known as ""countermeasures"". The assets would then be sold or collateralised and the proceeds handed to Ukraine  or to a dedicated reconstruction fund.Others raise concerns  though  that it would go against international norms and open a legal Pandora's box given that it would be something of a precedent and that Russia would challenge the move in the courts.Previous examples of such seizures  such as of Iraqi assets after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait  and of German assets after World War Two  happened after those wars had ended  not while they were still raging - as with Russia's invasion of Ukraine.Even in the United States  leading sovereign debt experts have highlighted that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not authorise an outright confiscation of frozen Russian property in the absence of actual armed conflict between the U.S. and Russia.Siphon Off RecordsThe lion's share of the nearly 210 billion euros ($230 billion) of Russian reserves locked in the EU - essentially bonds and other types of securities in which the Russian central bank had invested - are held in a Brussels-based depository called Euroclear.When those assets reach their final payout days - or ""mature""  in banker speak - they get converted into cash  a transaction that is taxed at a rate of 25% in Belgium.Officials in the EU  as well as in the U.S. and Britain where much smaller amounts are frozen  are therefore proposing ringfencing that type of revenue for Ukraine  estimating it will add up to 15-20 billion euros by 2027.EU leaders could give the thumbs-up to such a move later this month. Some in the bloc are still wary  though  and the European Central Bank has warned that claiming the trapped Russian assets should only be done in tandem with G7 powers. They want to ensure it isn't just the euro that is affected if other countries such as China start repatriating their reserves as a precaution against them being swooped on down the line.Some lawyers also point out that  legally  there is little difference between siphoning off the maturity revenues and grabbing the full $300-350 billion.There is the risk that Russia could  through court action  try and seize Euroclear cash in securities depositories in Hong Kong  Dubai and elsewhere. The worry is that this could drain Euroclear capital and require a huge bailout.There are plans therefore to set aside some of the siphoned-off money as a safety net.Reparation Bonds""Reparation bonds"" have also been suggested as a way of circumventing some of the legal problems. Ukraine would sell securities that pay out if - and only if - it receives reparations from Russia for the damage done by the war.Interest payments could also roll up and only become payable if Kyiv gets compensation.The bondholders would not have a contractual claim on the Kremlin's frozen reserves. But given that Russia is unlikely to pay up willingly  these assets would be the most likely source of cash to pay for damages.Since the reserves are accruing interest  they could be used to pay both the bonds' principal and more regular coupon payments. This would be different from confiscation  because the assets would only be transferred if a legitimate compensation mechanism first ruled that damages were due to Ukraine.Ukraine would have a plausible way to collect on any damages awarded up to the value of the reserves. It could therefore issue reparation bonds up to $300-350 billion. But it would only get anything like this sum if the United States  EU governments and other allies were willing to buy the securities.Syndicated LoanThe bond idea has been fleshed out further by Lee Buchheit  a veteran legal expert in sovereign debt  and Daleep Singh  who has just returned to the White House as deputy national security adviser for international economics.Their view is that Ukraine could pledge its claim for reparations against Russia to a syndicate of its allies in return for a loan. If Moscow refused to pay the damages  the allies could then use Russia's frozen assets to pay off the loan. The justification for doing this is the widely recognised legal principle that  if a creditor controls a debtor's assets  it can set off those assets against an unpaid debt.(Except for the headline  this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",neutral,0.19,0.78,0.03,negative,0.02,0.23,0.75,True,English,"['Frozen Funds', 'West', 'Russia', 'Ukraine', 'International Emergency Economic Powers Act', 'deputy national security adviser', 'leading sovereign debt experts', 'dedicated reconstruction fund', 'actual armed conflict', 'final payout days', 'European Central Bank', '$300-350 billion worth', 'Siphon Off Records', 'regular coupon payments', 'Russian central bank', 'veteran legal expert', '15-20 billion euros', 'legitimate compensation mechanism', 'Russian financial assets', 'G7 powers', '210 billion euros', 'unpaid debt', 'international policymakers', 'international law', 'international norms', 'international economics', 'off money', 'Russian property', 'legal Pandora', 'legal problems', 'legal principle', 'court action', 'Previous examples', 'United States', 'U.S.', 'other types', 'Brussels-based depository', 'smaller amounts', 'other countries', 'little difference', 'maturity revenues', 'Hong Kong', 'Euroclear capital', 'huge bailout', 'safety net', 'Interest payments', 'likely source', 'bond idea', 'Lee Buchheit', 'Daleep Singh', 'White House', 'NDTV staff', 'syndicated feed', 'Russian assets', 'Russian reserves', 'Reparation Bonds', ""bonds' principal"", 'Iraqi assets', 'German assets', 'frozen assets', 'Euroclear cash', 'Western officials', 'contested precedent', 'World War', 'EU leaders', 'contractual claim', 'frozen reserves', 'plausible way', 'EU governments', 'outright confiscation', 'other allies', 'Syndicated Loan', 'securities depositories', 'risk', 'Ukraine', 'ideas', 'lawyers', 'doctrine', 'countermeasures', 'proceeds', 'Others', 'concerns', 'box', 'something', 'move', 'courts', 'seizures', '1990 invasion', 'Kuwait', 'wars', 'IEEPA', 'absence', 'share', 'banker', 'transaction', 'rate', 'Belgium', 'Britain', 'thumbs', 'bloc', 'tandem', 'China', 'precaution', 'line', 'Dubai', 'worry', 'plans', 'reparations', 'damage', 'Kyiv', 'bondholders', 'Kremlin', 'value', 'sum', 'view', 'return', 'Moscow', 'justification', 'creditor', 'debtor', 'story']",2024-03-12,2024-03-12,ndtv.com

But we need a significant amount in Euroclear...beause Euroclear will face a lot of claims "" the official said.The claims are to come from the Russian central bank which  through Russian courts that do not recognise Western sanctions  is likely to put its hands on the 33 billion euros of Euroclear money in the national securities depository in Moscow.Russia could also take legal action to seize Euroclear cash in securities depositories in Hong Kong and Dubai  the official said  and more lawsuits against are likely from Western banks which lost their money invested in Russia  the official said.""That's the mechanism how Euroclear could be totally emptied  basically "" the senior EU official said.If Euroclear were to run out of capital  the Belgian central bank would have to withdraw its licence  likely causing a global financial crisis because Euroclear has assets in custody of 37 trillion euros  the official said.Story continuesThe Commission is to present a proposal next week on how much of the profits over the next four years can immediately go to Ukraine and in what form  and how much should be kept to create the safety buffer. There should also be an emergency mechanism should Euroclear get in trouble  the official said.Belgium  which taxes the profits that Euroclear makes on the Russian cash at 25%  expects to get 1.7 billion euros in tax from that in 2024 of which 1.5 billion will be sent to Kyiv this year and the rest in 2025  the official said.From the start of the war until last February  the profits generated by the Russian assets amounted to 5.2 billion euros.But because the EU only decided to clarify the legal situation of the money on February 12th  profits accrued until then will have to wait until the final settlement at the end of the war to be transferred to Ukraine  the official said  because it would be very difficult to access them retroactively.(Reporting by Jan Strupczewski; Editing by Angus MacSwan)",neutral,0.03,0.89,0.08,negative,0.03,0.25,0.72,True,English,"['EU-frozen Russian assets', 'EU official', 'various Russian central bank securities', 'Belgian central securities depository', 'Belgian central bank', 'national securities depository', 'global interest rates', 'next four years', 'global financial system', 'global financial crisis', 'senior EU official', 'securities depositories', 'financial stability', 'Russian retaliation', 'Russian courts', 'Russian cash', 'Russian assets', 'Jan Strupczewski', 'European Union', 'gross amount', 'regular basis', 'significant amount', 'Western sanctions', 'legal action', 'Hong Kong', 'Western banks', '37 trillion euros', 'The Commission', 'last February', 'legal situation', 'February 12th', 'final settlement', 'Angus MacSwan', '20 billion euros', '190 billion euros', '33 billion euros', '1.7 billion euros', '5.2 billion euros', 'safety buffer', 'emergency mechanism', 'beause Euroclear', 'Euroclear cash', 'tax profits', 'Euroclear money', '15 billion', 'BRUSSELS', 'Reuters', 'Moscow', 'invasion', 'Ukraine', 'evolution', 'Part', 'Kyiv', 'equivalent', 'ADVERTISEMENT', 'breach', 'negotiations', 'moment', 'war', 'settlements', 'lot', 'claims', 'hands', 'Dubai', 'lawsuits', 'capital', 'licence', 'custody', 'Story', 'proposal', 'form', 'trouble', 'Belgium', 'start', 'end', 'Editing']",2024-03-12,2024-03-12,ca.finance.yahoo.com

The assets at Euroclear have already generated €3.85 billion ($4.2 billion) in profit since Russia’s Feb. 24  2022 full-scale invasion started. However  Ukraine would receive what would remain of the profits after legal fees from litigation from the over 100 lawsuits from Russia over the frozen assets. So  depending on interest rates  Ukraine could receive somewhere between €2 billion ($2.2 billion) and €3 ($3.3 billion) after EU capitals come to an agreement on sending the money.According to FT  the assets are expected to generate about €20 billion ($22 billion) in profits by 2027.As the FT reported  Russia may seek to seize some €33 billion ($36 billion) in Western assets frozen by Russia’s central securities depository.AdvertisementThe EU plan follows newly adopted legislation last month that created a path for confiscated funds to be transferred to Ukraine.,neutral,0.04,0.8,0.17,negative,0.03,0.32,0.65,True,English,"['Frozen Russian Assets', 'EU Plans', 'Kyiv', 'FT', '3', 'European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen', 'The European Commission', 'Belgium clearing house', 'central securities depository', 'EU leader summit', 'European capitals', 'EU officials', 'EU capitals', 'Financial Times', 'US Congressional', 'post-war reconstruction', 'warm relations', 'ongoing invasion', 'down version', 'enough support', '2022 full-scale invasion', 'legal fees', 'interest rates', 'Russian assets', 'frozen assets', 'Western assets', 'military aid', 'EU plan', 'frozen profits', 'defense funds', 'Ukraine', 'Euroclear', 'proposal', 'discussion', 'Kyiv', 'July', 'wake', 'FT', 'opposition', 'Hungary', 'Kremlin', 'Advertisement', 'February', 'plans', 'Feb.', 'litigation', '100 lawsuits', 'agreement', 'money', 'legislation', 'path']",2024-03-12,2024-03-12,kyivpost.com

This comes amid debate among European leaders over whether to use Russian assets  mostly kept in Belgium  to fund the war in Ukraine.

The gargantuan number is the vast majority of the £220bn of total frozen Russian assets in Japan and the West  according to The Economist.

British chipmaker ARM Holdings Plc went public in New York last year  while Irish building group CRH Plc switched its primary listing there from London and scrapped its Dublin shares.Euronext London serves UK-based clients of Euronext NV’s sprawling stock exchange network. Gallagher suggested press coverage of London IPOs should be done at the old Royal Exchange building near the Bank of England  which is now home to shops and restaurants  while Paris could use the Palais Brongniart.“In New York there’s these massive symbols of capitalism — you’re outside the pillars of Wall Street — it’s on films ” he said. “You come to Europe and it’s a far less visually-appealing experience  and the whole sensorial aspect of it is kind of missing.”“From my experience  from companies I speak to  it matters — especially for those who have founded the firm  when they’re looking to take their families and their co-founders with them on on a journey ” he said.Companies only raised about $14 billion via IPOs on European exchanges last year  a 36% drop from the almost $22 billion raised in 2022  according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Others have been abandoning the region  such as agricultural machinery group CNH Industrial NV  which delisted from Milan to leave New York as its primary listing.Management of companies that list in London are typically photographed on the balcony inside the London Stock Exchange Group Plc’s Paternoster Square office  with the market open live-streamed on LinkedIn. Aston Martin Lagonda Global Holdings Plc’s high-profile IPO in 2018 featured sports cars scattered around the square.Bloomberg News has contacted the London Stock Exchange Group for comment.

Photograph: Dara MacDónaillOfficials from Euronext Dublin and the wider Irish capital markets ecosystem are developing a detailed pitch for the Government to help reboot the initial public offerings (IPOs) market here after a report submitted last year met resistance as its proposals were not fleshed out  according to sources.As many as 20 senior figures from the Irish stock market operator and firms spanning stockbroking  corporate law  accountancy  and financial public relations have been divided into three working groups seeking to develop three core recommendations from the 2023 report  they said. Euronext Dublin is co-ordinating the effort.The report  written by Grant Thornton  called for the establishment of a so-called “cornerstone fund” to participate in IPOs  tax incentives for retail investors to put money into public companies  and tax breaks for founders or owners of companies that join the market.There is a growing sense of urgency to find ways to revive the IPO market  given the dearth of flotations in recent years  recent exits of the two former largest companies on the Iseq 20  CRH and Flutter Entertainment  and planned departure of another heavyweight  Smurfit Kappa.READ MOREOnly three companies have come to the market in Dublin in the past five years: Uniphar  the healthcare group; Corre Energy  a developer of underground storage solutions for renewable energy; and medtech firm HealthBeacon  the last IPO  which occurred in late 2021. HealthBeacon was delisted last month  as it emerged from examinership after running out of money.“There is a growing realisation that this is not just a Euronext problem  but an Ireland Inc problem ” said a source familiar with the project.The hope is that a detailed set of proposals will be submitted by the group  known as the Irish Equity Market Forum  to the departments of Finance and Enterprise  Trade and Employment by the end of April to get in at an early stage of the last budget cycle before a scheduled general election  the sources added.Is Ireland in recession? Listen | 33:05Many would-be IPO prospects have succumbed in the past decade to the attractions of venture capital  private equity money and trade sales  in an era — until recently — of ultra-low interest rates. Dublin has also been hit more than most western markets by an international trend in recent decades of a shrinking pool of investable public companies  a phenomenon known as “de-equitisation”.The Grant Thornton report suggested that the diminution of the Irish stock market — which had been used by the likes of CRH  Ryanair and Kerry to grow into international leaders in their respective sectors — raises existential questions.“Action is required to ensure the domestic equity market remains a viable funding mechanism for Irish companies  commercially viable for market participants  and continues to support the funding needs of Ireland’s growing companies ” the report said. “A local exchange is critical to supporting local enterprise.”Companies listed on the Irish Stock Exchange  Euronext Dublin  contributed €12.4 billion to the domestic economy in 2022  according to the Grant Thornton report.Dublin-listed companies employed approximately 47 000 people across the State  directly generating €6.7 billion in wages that year  it added. A further 40 000 jobs are said to be indirectly supported by such companies.The average daily value of shares traded on Euronext Dublin  which operates the Irish stock market  plunged by 30 per cent on the year in February  following the exits of heavyweight groups CRH and Flutter Entertainment from the market over the previous five months.The global number of IPOs slid 16 per cent last year to 1 429 deals  amid uncertainty about the economy and soaring interest rates  according to the latest S&P Global Market Intelligence data. The figure was off 40 per cent from a record set in 2021  a year which only saw two IPOs in Dublin.,neutral,0.05,0.93,0.02,mixed,0.21,0.26,0.54,True,English,"['Irish stock exchange owner', 'initial public offerings', 'Government pitch', 'latest S&P Global Market Intelligence data', 'wider Irish capital markets ecosystem', 'Irish Equity Market Forum', 'Irish stock market operator', 'two former largest companies', 'The Grant Thornton report', 'most western markets', 'Irish Stock Exchange', 'Dara MacDónaill', 'underground storage solutions', 'average daily value', 'previous five months', 'initial public offerings', 'financial public relations', 'three core recommendations', 'domestic equity market', 'last budget cycle', 'viable funding mechanism', 'ultra-low interest rates', 'soaring interest rates', 'three working groups', 'past five years', 'private equity money', 'investable public companies', 'Ireland Inc problem', 'global number', 'venture capital', 'Irish companies', 'IPO market', 'market participants', 'three companies', 'recent years', 'last IPO', 'Euronext problem', 'past decade', 'funding needs', 'local exchange', 'two IPOs', 'IPOs) market', 'detailed pitch', '20 senior figures', 'corporate law', 'cornerstone fund', 'tax incentives', 'retail investors', 'tax breaks', 'growing sense', 'Flutter Entertainment', 'Smurfit Kappa', 'Corre Energy', 'renewable energy', 'medtech firm', 'growing realisation', 'detailed set', 'early stage', 'general election', 'IPO prospects', 'international trend', 'recent decades', 'shrinking pool', 'international leaders', 'respective sectors', 'existential questions', 'domestic economy', '30 per cent', 'heavyweight groups', 'growing companies', 'Dublin-listed companies', 'Euronext Dublin', 'recent exits', 'healthcare group', 'trade sales', 'local enterprise', '2023 report', 'plan', 'Photograph', 'Officials', 'Government', 'resistance', 'proposals', 'sources', 'many', 'firms', 'stockbroking', 'accountancy', 'effort', 'establishment', 'founders', 'owners', 'urgency', 'ways', 'dearth', 'flotations', 'Iseq', 'CRH', 'departure', 'READ', 'Uniphar', 'developer', 'HealthBeacon', 'examinership', 'project', 'hope', 'departments', 'Finance', 'Employment', 'April', 'recession', 'Listen', 'attractions', 'phenomenon', 'equitisation', 'diminution', 'likes', 'Ryanair', 'Kerry', '47,000 people', 'State', 'wages', '40,000 jobs', 'shares', 'February', '1,429 deals', 'uncertainty', 'record']",2024-03-11,2024-03-12,irishtimes.com

This unexpected improvement in the placebo group complicated the interpretation of the results based on this endpoint.However  other data from PREMIER suggested no deterioration in the condition of patients under treatment  which is a positive sign in the context of a degenerative disease such as CMT1A. In the meantime  the trial reaffirmed the high safety profile of the treatment already established in all previous studies. This safety profile is crucial for the treatment of a chronic disease such as CMT1A.In addition  pre-specified subgroup analyses of the PREMIER trial suggested an efficacy signal  including a better response in treated patients with a body mass index (BMI) of less than 25  or in patients under 45 years of age.Finally  analysis of the data revealed that  while the study as a whole was indeed randomized into two arms (PXT3003 and placebo)  the distribution of the two treatments within each clinical investigation center was not balanced  contrary to what is normally expected. This major factor may have had a significant impact on the study results.The Company has therefore contested invoices issued by the contract research organization (CRO) mandated by Pharnext to conduct PREMIER trial  and further actions including legal action are envisaged.Beyond this  the Company confirms  as announced on February 28  it is waiting for the upcoming results (by summer 2024) from the Phase III trial currently being conducted in China by partner Tasly (through a joint venture owned 30% by Pharnext) which acquired the licensing rights for PXT3003 in China in 2017  with 2 options:If results from the study in China are negative  Pharnext will analyze these results and draw the necessary conclusions in conjunction with the Company's shareholders.If results from the study in China are positive  showing a statistically significant benefit of PXT3003  Pharnext will continue its dialogue with the FDA and EMA to agree on a registration process for PXT3003 in CMT1A.Given available data and the favorable outlook if results from the study conducted in China are positive  the Company considers it has sufficient satisfactory elements to maintain its operations  at least until receipt of the said results.UPDATE ON NEGOTIATIONS VALUING PXT3003 OPERATING RIGHTSAs announced on November 27  2023[4]  the Company decided to wait for the publication of PREMIER topline results before signing an exclusivity agreement with one of the candidate pharmaceuticals  and valuing PXT3003. At that time  the Company had received 3 main offers  including 1 binding and 2 non-binding  from pharmaceutical companies.To date  the 3 main candidates are still waiting for final conclusions from the ongoing analyses as well as topline results from the study conducted in China  and none of them has formally declared withdrawal from the process. Even more  working meetings are being scheduled with some candidates to analyze available data. The Company hopes these candidates will be able to update their position in terms of intent and valuation.UPDATE ON CASH CONSUMPTION AND COST REDUCTION PLANIn this context  as announced on January 17  2024[5]  the Company embarked on a drastic cost-cutting plan with the aim of reducing cash consumption from operating expenses from an average of €2.0m per month in S1 2023 to an average of €0.5-0.9m per month in S1 2024.In February 2024  cash consumption by operations was €0.57m.If results from the study in China are positive  the Company will be able to reactivate some of its expenses  with a relaunch budget estimated at €1.0-1.5m per month and a view to submitting PXT3003 for registration in CMT1A by the FDA and EMA. In this case  the Company plans to pass on all or part of these additional costs to candidates for PXT3003 rights.As announced on February 15  2024[6]  the Company is working to align its financial resources and commitments with main partners. These discussions have been initiated within the framework of a confidential conciliation procedure opened under the aegis of the Paris Commercial Court at the Company's request.UPDATE ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL STRUCTUREOn March 8  2024  the Company had cash of €0.184m and theoretical capacities of €11.9m under the financing agreement with Global Tech Opportunities 13.In addition to the cash burn described above  the Company's main commitments are as follows:Gross financial debt of €6m mainly comprising the cash agreement between Néovacs and Pharnext (€3m) and the bonds subscribed by Global Tech Opportunities 13 not yet converted into shares (€3m); debts not repayable in cash in the short term;Trade payables of around €7m  mainly comprising invoices issued by clinical trial partners.Around 30% of these debts (by value) are currently being contested by Pharnext  and the conciliation process currently underway aims to renegotiate the amount and maturity of debts borne by the Company. Several of the Company's major creditors  already representing more than 50% of debts (by value) and expected to rise to nearly 80% in the next few weeks  agreed to suspend the payment of their debts  if necessary  pending results from the study in China  which reinforces the principle of going concern in the short term.The Company will provide regular updates on the subject.UPDATE ON THE SHAREHOLDERS' MEETING TO BE HELD ON FEBRUARY 15  2024On February 15  2024  the Company's shareholders were convened for a general meeting to discuss the Company's situation and outlooks. As part of discussions  shareholders received the special report issued by the Company's statutory auditors  who warned of their uncertainties regarding the Company's ability to continue as a going concern[7]  as well as the management's responses.The shareholders' meeting could not validly be held for lack of a quorum  and the conciliation procedure in progress has the effect of suspending the alert procedure initiated by statutory auditors. There are therefore no plans to reconvene the meeting in the short term.UPDATE ON THE NEXT STEPS IN THE CONCILIATION PROCESSThe current conciliation procedure is open for a period of 3 months  i.e. until May 15  2024  with a possible extension of 1 month  which should enable the Company to maintain its activities until data from the PREMIER trial are fully analyzed and  above all  until topline results from the study in China are issued.This period should give the Company time to restructure its liabilities and prepare for the next steps post-announcement of these results.UPDATE ON PHARNEXT SHARE LISTINGThe Company asked Euronext to suspend the listing of its shares with effect from March 6  2024  pending publication of this press release.The Company therefore applied to Euronext to resume trading in its shares from the session of March 12  and will continue to inform the market on a regular basis as part of its periodic and ongoing information obligations. In this respect  Pharnext aims to publish its 2023 financial statements by April 30  2024  at the latest.Hugo Brugière  Manager of Pharnext  said: “We have heard requests for a full update on our latest announcements and the situation to date regarding results from clinical trials  discussions with partners  financial situation and next steps.The horizon is clearly set  and results from the study conducted in China will be a turning point for Pharnext. If they are positive  we will once again have the opportunity to create a great deal of value. If they are negative  we will decide with the Company's shareholders what we want to do.""DisclaimerPharnext arranged (I) financing in the form of convertible bonds financing (OCEAN-BSA) with Global Tech Opportunities 13 which  after receiving the shares resulting from the conversion or exercise of these instruments  will not remain shareholder of the Company  and (II) financing in OS bonds which were subsequently transferred to a trust  which is now responsible for their equitization.The shares resulting from the conversion or exercise of the above-mentioned securities will generally be sold on the market at very short notice  which may create strong downward pressure on the share price. In the specific case of the trust  the shares are sold on the market in accordance with the terms set out in the trust agreement.Shareholders may suffer a loss of their invested capital due to a significant fall in the Company's share price  as well as significant dilution due to the large number of securities issued to Global Tech Opportunities 13 and/or the trust.Investors are advised to exercise extreme caution before deciding to invest in the securities of a listed company that carries out such dilutive financing transactions  particularly when they are carried out in succession. The Company wishes to point out that this is not the first dilutive financing transaction it has undertaken.About PharnextPharnext is an advanced clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapies for neurodegenerative diseases currently without satisfactory therapeutic solutions.

AI Labs now has access to the complete set of UpToDate’s evidence-based clinical content and graded recommendations across more than 25 medical specialties. It is the only large language model (LLM) exclusively powered by UpToDate trusted content.With today’s launch of UpToDate Enterprise™ Edition  more than 100 U.S. hospitals and major health systems will have access to AI Labs’ testing and validation program. This program is a critical step in the development of Clinical GenAI as a responsible and trusted point-of-care solution.Clinical GenAI built on a foundation of trustAccording to a recent Wolters Kluwer survey  one of the biggest concerns Americans have about GenAI in healthcare is not knowing where the medical information being used came from or how it is validated.“Building Clinical GenAI tools that care teams turn to for clear  evidence-based answers is more than a technology challenge—it’s a responsibility to focus on safety  reliability  and trust through transparency ” said Greg Samios  President & CEO of Clinical Effectiveness  Wolters Kluwer Health.“Wolters Kluwer is focused on setting the standard for Clinical GenAI a transformative solution that creates an interactive experience for clinicians and care teams. We are doing this by collaborating with healthcare organizations  experts  and technology leaders to get it right.”Relentless innovation in Clinical GenAIUpToDate’s AI Lab has established core capabilities from verbatim UpToDate passage retrieval to AI-synthesized responses based exclusively on UpToDate’s unparalleled content. By asking natural language questions  AI Labs’ capabilities deliver targeted answers derived exclusively from UpToDate’s continually updated content  avoiding the pitfalls of outdated or superseded evidence. Further  AI Labs remembers query context and provides relevant evidence citations.Collaborating with customers for safer  more transparent GenAIDiscussing the potential of GenAI for healthcare  Eric Alper  MD  Senior Vice President  Chief Quality Officer  and Chief Clinical Informatics Officer at UMass Memorial Health stated: “UpToDate has long provided clinicians with the information they need to make clinical decisions. From what I’ve seen  the combination of UpToDate with GenAI through AI Labs could get clinicians to expert  succinct  evidenced-based content even faster.”Customers play a valuable role in the ongoing development of AI Labs. Julio Ramirez  MD  Chief Scientific Officer at Norton Infectious Diseases Institute commented  “I’ve provided feedback to Wolters Kluwer on AI Labs since last year. I’m impressed with their approach and the progress they have made on the responsible use of Gen AI in clinical decision support. With the entire UpToDate content set now in AI Labs  as well as expanded access to the testing and validation program by more clinicians  there is the opportunity to accelerate the use of Gen AI in clinical decision support.”When seconds count  GenAI can aid in clinicians finding answers more quickly. Patrick Snowman  MD  Chief  Department of Medicine at Hilton Head Regional Health explains: “In the Emergency Department  time is of the essence. It is imperative to have a solution like UpToDate to quickly access vital information that supports clinical care. I look forward to testing and validating that GenAI  when combined with UpToDate  offers the ability to get faster and more concise answers in support of delivering better care.”In recognition of the company’s approach to GenAI  Wolters Kluwer Health was recently named a healthcare technology pioneer for GenAI in clinical settings by industry analysts at Frost & Sullivan.AI Labs will be demonstrated at the Wolters Kluwer booth  #2927  at the HIMSS24 Global Conference and Exhibition.

BidCo’s binding proposal to the Board did not mention that those conditions could be waived.On 21 February 2024 Warner Music group (“WMG”) approached the Company to initiate discussions with respect to a potential combination of Believe with WMG and to obtain access to confidential information with a view to possibly making a more attractive offer to the Company and its shareholders. The Ad-Hoc Committee  seeking to assess whether WMG’s proposal could constitute an alternative to the Bidco offer on improved financial terms  asked WMG for certain clarification.WMG indicated to the directors of Believe on February 27  2024 that  at this stage  it could value Believe at a price of at least €17/share (coupon attached) based on currently available public information  restating that at this stage its approach did not constitute an offer or constitute any obligation to make an offer  nor did it evidence an intention to make an offer.Following WMG’s approach  BidCo informed the Board of Directors of the Company on 28 February 2024 of its unilateral right to waive the Board Condition under the contracts for the Blocks Acquisition; and of its decision to waive such Condition. BidCo further indicated to the Board that  consequently  the Block Acquisitions remained subject only to the Regulatory Condition (relating to anti-trust clearances)  which BidCo expected to obtain in a short timeframe.In a press release of 7 March 2024  WMG reiterated its expression of interest publicly. In this press release  WMG indicated that it was awaiting access to certain due diligence information identified to the Company to confirm its indicative price of at least 17 euros per share (coupon attached). In this press release  WMG also noted that  in its view  the waiver was contrary to French tender rules and that the validity of the waiver of the Board Condition could be challenged.In turn  the Consortium issued a press release on 8 March 2024 indicating that  in its view  its decision to waive the Board Condition is perfectly valid and has been done in full compliance with French regulations. The Consortium confirmed that it will  after completion of the Blocks Acquisition  file a mandatory tender offer to acquire the remaining 28% free float at the same price of €15 paid to the selling shareholders of the blocks as required by French tender offer regulation.The Ad-Hoc Committee notes that  following the waiver of the Board Condition  the completion of the Block Acquisitions would put BidCo in a position of majority control of Believe  regardless of the opinion of the board and of the report of the independent expert.This situation  unless considered legally invalid  would prevent a competing bidder from acquiring control2.The Ad-Hoc Committee considers that it is the duty of the Board of Directors to ensure that the process around the transfer of majority control and the resulting offer take place in accordance with applicable rules. The Board must also permit  including by giving access to information in a fair manner  that all shareholders of Believe have the option to take advantage of the best possible offer  to the extent such offer is reasonably likely to be successful (including in view of validly existing agreements among shareholders).In view of differing views on the validity of the waiver of the Board Condition3  the Ad-hoc Committee has seized the “Autorité des marchés financiers” (“AMF”).In this request  the Ad-Hoc Committee has asked the AMF whether (i) BidCo was able  in the prevailing circumstances  to waive freely and unilaterally  the Board Condition  since it had the power to do so in its contracts with the sellers of the Blocks  or whether  (ii) in view of the initial Board Condition and of a third party preliminary proposal at a potentially higher price  the principles of tender offers  including the principle of free confrontation of offers and competing offers  prevented such waiver of the Board Condition.In view of these circumstances  the Ad-hoc Committee has decided not to engage  at this stage  in WMG’s request to have access to certain confidential information  pending clarification by the AMF.The Ad-Hoc Committee will continue to perform its mission and keep the market informed in accordance with applicable rules.*****About BelieveBelieve is one of the world’s leading digital music companies.

This worldwide innovation  enabling 99% of marine hydrocarbon waste to be recycled into new petroleum products  was a success after just 18 months of operations  thanks to the prompt deployment of supply and sales networks for finished products. Since then  the Sines unit has recycled and produced 180 000 tonnes  generating an annual EBITDA of around €2.2 million (excluding 2020  the COVID year).Ecoslops ProvenceIt was not possible to duplicate this success on the second unit (Ecoslops Provence)  inaugurated in 2021  due to unfavorable changes in local market conditions  with in particular stiffer competition for hydrocarbon waste supplies in the catchment area (higher prices  smaller quantities) and difficulties with technical adaptations made necessary by the need to extend sourcing to waste from land-based industries. Indeed  the volumes of residues collected at the Port of Marseille's oil terminal fell sharply between the date of the investment decision in 2017 and the unit's commissioning in 2021.The structural rather than cyclical nature of these difficulties (at least as far as supplies are concerned) led us to seek a solution in order to (i) preserve the Group's financial resources and (ii) give this unit a future in a different scope.As a result  the two Ecoslops Provence partners agreed that TotalEnergies would buy Ecoslops' 75% stake in Ecoslops Provence and operate the unit on its own at 100% (with a non-competition clause).Impact of the sale of Ecoslops ProvenceThis decision was rapidly implemented  and the transaction was closed and paid for on February 29. No vendor warranties have been granted by Ecoslops SA. The cash payment of €8 million for the shares and the shareholder loan is combined with by the take-over of Ecoslops Provence's bank debt which  at 31/12/2023  amounted to €5 million (previously consolidated in Ecoslops SA's accounts). Part of the €8 million payment gave rise to a repayment by Ecoslops SA on the same day of the sums due to the European Investment Bank (""EIB"") in respect of 2023  i.e. €1.9 million (€0.5 million in amortized capital and €1.4 million in interest and royalty fees).Following this transaction  Ecoslops' net debt fell from €23.2M to €10.3M over one year.31/12/2022 30/06/2023 31/12/2023* Gross Debt (29 2) (29 4) (18 7) Cash available 6 0 4 7 8 4 Net debt (23 2) (24 7) (10 3)*: Unaudited data and proforma as if the transaction had taken place on 31/12/2023The impact of the disposal of Ecoslops Provence on the consolidated financial statements of Ecoslops SA is a limited book loss of €1.8 million. As a reminder  Ecoslops Provence's book loss amounted to 2.2M€ in 2021 and 2.7M€ in 2022. This level of loss was incompatible with Ecoslops SA's financial capacities and fully justifies the decision to sell this non-strategic asset at this price.Perspectives for the refocused GroupEcoslops  refocused on its historic Sines business and the development of the Scarabox®  now has financial and human resources in line with its roadmap.SinesThe Portuguese unit's business is correlated to oil prices and supplies  and generates an average EBITDA of €2.2 million/year. The subsidiary is financially autonomous and now raises its own financing. It has a reasonable level of debt (net debt at the end of 2023 of €5.3M  i.e. 2.4 times annual EBITDA)  enabling it to meet its investment needs while being able to repay the parent company's current account (down from €10M to €3.3M between 2017 and 2023).With the concession in the Port of Sines due to expire at the end of 2027  discussions have already begun to anticipate its renewal  with a possible extension to 2037.Productivity optimization projects are expected to improve the unit's margins in the future.The recently obtained ISCC Plus certification is also a very positive factor  as many customers are looking for products with this sustainability label.Scarabox®This activity  born of repeated requests from numerous prospects over the years  got off to a slower start than expected. Indeed  after the construction and delivery of the first unit for Valtech Energy in Cameroon  assembly and start-up work was hampered by a lack of local human and financial resources. Ecoslops  for its part  was faced at the same time with the difficulties of Ecoslops Provence  and was unable to make up for these delays. The refocusing of Ecoslops will enable to dedicate more resources to this activity  both technical and financial. The internal reorganization will enable us to increase the number of FTEs (full-time equivalents) in this strategic activity from 1 to 3.On completion of the finalization work in Cameroon  Ecoslops will increase its stake in Valtech Energy from 17% to 49% by converting 300 k€ of current account into capital.The partnership with PARLYM  established in 2023  is very active  and the two companies have agreed to work together on both the Cameroon and Ivory Coast projects. As a reminder  this agreement will take the form of a joint structure (Parlym 80%/Ecoslops 20%) whose purpose is to invest a majority stake in local projects co-developed and financed by the two partners  starting with Ivory Coast.In Ivory Coast  a letter of intent was signed at the beginning of the year between Ecoslops  Parlym and SIR (Ivory Coast’s national refinery with a capacity of 4 million tonnes)  under which SIR is to take a 5% stake in the local company  with a board member. SIR is the dominant national and regional player in the refining and production of petroleum products. This agreement is therefore highly structuring for the future of the project  insofar as it confirms the concrete support of the Ivorian authorities  who see in the Scarabox® the appropriate solution for dealing with pollution from hydrocarbon residues and used oils.Headquarters supportThe head office comprises the following departments: General Management  Finance  Development  Projects and Operations  CSR and Office Management  i.e. 9 people (8.5 FTE).It supports the two businesses in commercial  technical and project structuring matters.The Projects and Operations team (4 engineers) is in charge of R&D  improvement projects at Sines and technical development of the Scarabox®.All head office costs (staff  rent  service providers  etc.) have been thoroughly reviewed. The savings plan has resulted in a reduction in head office costs from €2.0 million to €1.5 million in two years.Future challengesEcoslops  having completed its refocusing on profitable  forward-looking activities and aligned its costs accordingly  is now focused on successfully completing the next stages of its plan  namely:- Renegotiation of the EIB bank loan (nominal €9.5 million  initial maturity 2027)- Renewal of the concession in the Port of Sines with GALP- Securing medium-term supplies to the Sines plant- Development of Scarabox® (Cameroon  Ivory Coast  other prospects...)GovernanceThe Board of Directors  which has been tightened around the current six members (Jean-Claude Company  Mark Inch  Pierre-Etienne Bindschedler  Olivier Fortesa  Xavier Ploquin  and Vincent Favier  who acts as Chairman and CEO) following the departure of two directors in 2023 (Pascal Foulon and Lionel Henry)  is experienced and has in-depth knowledge of the challenges surrounding the company and its sector. They made a major contribution to the strategic decisions taken in 2023  and also supported management in implementing its decisions vis-à-vis third parties. It is important for the company to be able to count on the continuity of this Board  and consequently the next Annual General Meeting  scheduled on 11 June  will be asked to renew the mandates expiring at that time (for Messrs. Company  Inch and Bindschedler) without requesting any additional appointments  in order to give priority to the efficiency of their operation.The Board of Directors and management are now fully focused on the challenges of 2024 and beyond  convinced that the company has all the necessary strengths to make this strategic shift.Next appointments18 April 2024 after close of trading: publication of 2023 annual results19 April 2024 at 11.00 am: analysts and investors conference11 June 2024 at 10.00 am: combined shareholder’s meetingABOUT ECOSLOPSEcoslops is listed on Euronext Growth in ParisCode ISIN : FR0011490648 - Ticker : ALESA / PEA-PME eligibleInvestor Relations : ir@ecoslops.com - 01 83 64 47 43Ecoslops is the cleantech that brings oil into the circular economy thanks to an innovative technology allowing the company toupgrade oil residues and used lub oil into new fuels and light bitumen.

Positive results from Part 2 of the investigational amlitelimab Phase 2b study STREAM-AD showed sustained improvement of signs and symptoms for 28 weeks in adults with moderate to severe AD who previously responded to amlitelimab and continued treatment. High responder rates were also observed in participants who were taken off amlitelimab. The safety profile was consistent with Part 1 of the study with amlitelimab being well-tolerated and no new safety concerns identified. These results were presented as part of a late-breaking session at the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) 2024 Conference in San Diego and support the quarterly (every 12-week) dosing of amlitelimab 250 mg with 500 mg loading dose (LD) now being investigated in a larger Phase 3 clinical program (OCEANA).Professor Stephan Weidinger  M.D  Ph.DDirector  Professor  Chair of Department of Dermatology and Allergy  University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein“Despite available treatment options  not all patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis respond sufficiently to these treatments  and many continue to suffer from skin lesions and symptoms such as persistent itch  which can have a high impact on their day-to-day lives. Results from this part of the study indicate amlitelimab’s potential for durable off-drug efficacy which supports the evaluation of a less frequent every 12-week dosing. This could offer an important benefit in the treatment of AD patients.”In the second part of the dose-ranging STREAM-AD study  responders to amlitelimab who achieved a 75% improvement in Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI-75) score and/or Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) score of 0 or 1 during the 24-week treatment period (Part 1) were re-randomized to explore the maintenance of clinical response over an additional 28-week period with continued amlitelimab treatment or amlitelimab withdrawal. Across all dose arms  patients who continued amlitelimab treatment maintained high EASI-75 and/or IGA 0/1  IGA 0/1  and EASI-75 responder rates through 28 weeks. High responder rates were also demonstrated among patients who were taken off treatment.In 69.2% of patients with continued treatment with amlitelimab 250 mg Q4W with 500 mg loading dose (LD) vs 58.8% of patients withdrawn from treatment IGA 0/1 and/or EASI-75 response was maintained.An analysis including pooled dose-arms showed that IGA 0/1 response was maintained in 71.9% of patients with continued treatment vs 57% of patients withdrawn from treatment. In this analysis  EASI-75 response was maintained in 69% of patients with continued treatment vs. 61.6% of patients withdrawn from treatment.AD-related biomarkers remained reduced at Week 52 in both amlitelimab withdrawn and continuing groups  despite amlitelimab reaching negligible levels in serum. Reduction of TARC  eosinophils  and IL-22 observed at Week 24 was maintained during withdrawal as well as in patients continuing treatment to Week 52. These biomarker data suggest the modulation of inflammatory T cells via the blockade of OX40L and durable control of AD after amlitelimab withdrawal.Naimish Patel  M.D.Head of Global Development  Immunology and Inflammation  Sanofi“It’s unprecedented to see this type of durability of clinical response  which we believe could be very meaningful to patients and is the reason why we selected an every 12-week dosing regimen in the AD pivotal program. AD is a chronic  lifelong disease  which means we must strive to provide a portfolio of solutions to patients that matches their individual needs and puts as little burden on them as possible. We are also moving with speed in our exploration of amlitelimab's potential in 5 other chronic inflammatory diseases  including asthma  hidradenitis suppurativa  scleroderma  celiac disease  and alopecia. In addition  we are exploring 6 other innovative MOAs in 8 dermatologic indications underscoring our commitment to patients with high unmet medical needs.”The aggregated safety profile of amlitelimab in Part 2 of this study was consistent with that of Part 1  with amlitelimab being well-tolerated  and no new safety concerns were identified during the 28-week maintenance/withdrawal period. Overall rates of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were 69.8% for continued amlitelimab treatment  71.9% for the amlitelimab withdrawal-arm and 66.7% for placebo. TEAEs more commonly observed included headache (11.6% amlitelimab continuation  3.9% amlitelimab withdrawal  6.7% placebo)  upper respiratory tract infection (9.3% amlitelimab continuation  5.5% amlitelimab withdrawal  20% placebo). No adverse events such as fever or chills  oral ulcers or conjunctivitis were observed across doses.Amlitelimab is a fully human non-T cell depleting monoclonal antibody that blocks OX40-Ligand  a key immune regulator  and has the potential to be a first- or best-in-class treatment for a range of immune-mediated diseases and inflammatory disorders  including moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (Phase 3)  asthma (Phase 2)  hidradenitis suppurativa (Phase 2)  scleroderma  celiac disease  and alopecia (Phase 2 studies to be initiated in 2024). By targeting OX40-Ligand  amlitelimab aims to restore balance between pro-inflammatory and regulatory T cells.Amlitelimab is currently under clinical investigation  and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.About STREAM-ADSTREAM-AD  a Phase 2b study  is a randomized double-blind  placebo-controlled study  evaluating amlitelimab in adult patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis whose disease was inadequately controlled with topical therapies or where such therapies were not advisable. This study is designed with two parts and is double-blind through both. Part 1 was a 24-week treatment period  and Part 2 was a 28-week maintenance/withdrawal period  which included clinical responders from Part 1  defined as participants achieving EASI-75 and/or IGA 0/1 at Week 24. Of 390 participants enrolled in Part 1  190 entered Part 2. Participants were re-randomized 3:1 to withdraw treatment or continue pre-Week 24 subcutaneous Q4W dose (250mg with 500mg loading dose (LD)  250mg  125mg  62.5mg  placebo responders continuing placebo)  and were followed to Week 52 for efficacy.The study enrolled 390 people in Australia  Bulgaria  Canada  Czechia  Germany  Hungary  Japan  Poland  Spain  Taiwan  the United Kingdom and the United States.About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people’s lives.

This worldwide innovation  enabling 99% of marine hydrocarbon waste to be recycled into new petroleum products  was a success after just 18 months of operations  thanks to the prompt deployment of supply and sales networks for finished products. Since then  the Sines unit has recycled and produced 180 000 tonnes  generating an annual EBITDA of around €2.2 million (excluding 2020  the COVID year).Ecoslops ProvenceIt was not possible to duplicate this success on the second unit (Ecoslops Provence)  inaugurated in 2021  due to unfavorable changes in local market conditions  with in particular stiffer competition for hydrocarbon waste supplies in the catchment area (higher prices  smaller quantities) and difficulties with technical adaptations made necessary by the need to extend sourcing to waste from land-based industries. Indeed  the volumes of residues collected at the Port of Marseille's oil terminal fell sharply between the date of the investment decision in 2017 and the unit's commissioning in 2021.The structural rather than cyclical nature of these difficulties (at least as far as supplies are concerned) led us to seek a solution in order to (i) preserve the Group's financial resources and (ii) give this unit a future in a different scope.As a result  the two Ecoslops Provence partners agreed that TotalEnergies would buy Ecoslops' 75% stake in Ecoslops Provence and operate the unit on its own at 100% (with a non-competition clause).Impact of the sale of Ecoslops ProvenceThis decision was rapidly implemented  and the transaction was closed and paid for on February 29. No vendor warranties have been granted by Ecoslops SA. The cash payment of €8 million for the shares and the shareholder loan is combined with by the take-over of Ecoslops Provence's bank debt which  at 31/12/2023  amounted to €5 million (previously consolidated in Ecoslops SA's accounts). Part of the €8 million payment gave rise to a repayment by Ecoslops SA on the same day of the sums due to the European Investment Bank (""EIB"") in respect of 2023  i.e. €1.9 million (€0.5 million in amortized capital and €1.4 million in interest and royalty fees).Following this transaction  Ecoslops' net debt fell from €23.2M to €10.3M over one year.31/12/2022 30/06/2023 31/12/2023* Gross Debt (29 2) (29 4) (18 7) Cash available 6 0 4 7 8 4 Net debt (23 2) (24 7) (10 3)*: Unaudited data and proforma as if the transaction had taken place on 31/12/2023The impact of the disposal of Ecoslops Provence on the consolidated financial statements of Ecoslops SA is a limited book loss of €1.8 million. As a reminder  Ecoslops Provence's book loss amounted to 2.2M€ in 2021 and 2.7M€ in 2022. This level of loss was incompatible with Ecoslops SA's financial capacities and fully justifies the decision to sell this non-strategic asset at this price.Perspectives for the refocused GroupEcoslops  refocused on its historic Sines business and the development of the Scarabox®  now has financial and human resources in line with its roadmap.SinesThe Portuguese unit's business is correlated to oil prices and supplies  and generates an average EBITDA of €2.2 million/year. The subsidiary is financially autonomous and now raises its own financing. It has a reasonable level of debt (net debt at the end of 2023 of €5.3M  i.e. 2.4 times annual EBITDA)  enabling it to meet its investment needs while being able to repay the parent company's current account (down from €10M to €3.3M between 2017 and 2023).With the concession in the Port of Sines due to expire at the end of 2027  discussions have already begun to anticipate its renewal  with a possible extension to 2037.Productivity optimization projects are expected to improve the unit's margins in the future.The recently obtained ISCC Plus certification is also a very positive factor  as many customers are looking for products with this sustainability label.Scarabox®This activity  born of repeated requests from numerous prospects over the years  got off to a slower start than expected. Indeed  after the construction and delivery of the first unit for Valtech Energy in Cameroon  assembly and start-up work was hampered by a lack of local human and financial resources. Ecoslops  for its part  was faced at the same time with the difficulties of Ecoslops Provence  and was unable to make up for these delays. The refocusing of Ecoslops will enable to dedicate more resources to this activity  both technical and financial. The internal reorganization will enable us to increase the number of FTEs (full-time equivalents) in this strategic activity from 1 to 3.On completion of the finalization work in Cameroon  Ecoslops will increase its stake in Valtech Energy from 17% to 49% by converting 300 k€ of current account into capital.The partnership with PARLYM  established in 2023  is very active  and the two companies have agreed to work together on both the Cameroon and Ivory Coast projects. As a reminder  this agreement will take the form of a joint structure (Parlym 80%/Ecoslops 20%) whose purpose is to invest a majority stake in local projects co-developed and financed by the two partners  starting with Ivory Coast.In Ivory Coast  a letter of intent was signed at the beginning of the year between Ecoslops  Parlym and SIR (Ivory Coast’s national refinery with a capacity of 4 million tonnes)  under which SIR is to take a 5% stake in the local company  with a board member. SIR is the dominant national and regional player in the refining and production of petroleum products. This agreement is therefore highly structuring for the future of the project  insofar as it confirms the concrete support of the Ivorian authorities  who see in the Scarabox® the appropriate solution for dealing with pollution from hydrocarbon residues and used oils.Headquarters supportThe head office comprises the following departments: General Management  Finance  Development  Projects and Operations  CSR and Office Management  i.e. 9 people (8.5 FTE).It supports the two businesses in commercial  technical and project structuring matters.The Projects and Operations team (4 engineers) is in charge of R&D  improvement projects at Sines and technical development of the Scarabox®.All head office costs (staff  rent  service providers  etc.) have been thoroughly reviewed. The savings plan has resulted in a reduction in head office costs from €2.0 million to €1.5 million in two years.Future challengesEcoslops  having completed its refocusing on profitable  forward-looking activities and aligned its costs accordingly  is now focused on successfully completing the next stages of its plan  namely:- Renegotiation of the EIB bank loan (nominal €9.5 million  initial maturity 2027)- Renewal of the concession in the Port of Sines with GALP- Securing medium-term supplies to the Sines plant- Development of Scarabox® (Cameroon  Ivory Coast  other prospects...)GovernanceThe Board of Directors  which has been tightened around the current six members (Jean-Claude Company  Mark Inch  Pierre-Etienne Bindschedler  Olivier Fortesa  Xavier Ploquin  and Vincent Favier  who acts as Chairman and CEO) following the departure of two directors in 2023 (Pascal Foulon and Lionel Henry)  is experienced and has in-depth knowledge of the challenges surrounding the company and its sector. They made a major contribution to the strategic decisions taken in 2023  and also supported management in implementing its decisions vis-à-vis third parties. It is important for the company to be able to count on the continuity of this Board  and consequently the next Annual General Meeting  scheduled on 11 June  will be asked to renew the mandates expiring at that time (for Messrs. Company  Inch and Bindschedler) without requesting any additional appointments  in order to give priority to the efficiency of their operation.The Board of Directors and management are now fully focused on the challenges of 2024 and beyond  convinced that the company has all the necessary strengths to make this strategic shift.Next appointments18 April 2024 after close of trading: publication of 2023 annual results19 April 2024 at 11.00 am: analysts and investors conference11 June 2024 at 10.00 am: combined shareholder’s meetingABOUT ECOSLOPSEcoslops is listed on Euronext Growth in ParisCode ISIN : FR0011490648 - Ticker : ALESA / PEA-PME eligibleInvestor Relations : ir@ecoslops.com - 01 83 64 47 43Ecoslops is the cleantech that brings oil into the circular economy thanks to an innovative technology allowing the company toupgrade oil residues and used lub oil into new fuels and light bitumen.

Project Business Automation (“PBA”) supports companies in all industries that seek to increase their revenue-based projects and enhance their operating results through automated processes. Due to a more recent entry of Planisware in the market relating to this pillar  PBA represented only 9% of 2023 revenue with customers  up by +9.6% thanks to new customer wins and cross-selling.Other revenue in 2023Other revenue mainly consisted of royalties invoiced by the Company to entities in which it continued to retain an equity interest for part of 2023  namely IFTP KK (fully consolidated since June 2023 following acquisition by the Company of the remaining equity stake in May 2023) and Planisware MIS (fully consolidated since October 2023  following acquisition by the Company of the remaining equity stake in September 2023). Following these acquisitions  transactions between the Company and the subsidiaries were eliminated in consolidation  driving the revenue decrease on this line of reporting  which is expected to be nil going forward  except for new subsidiaries in which the Group may have equity interest in the future.Key financial figuresIn € million 23'FY 22'FY Variation YoY Total revenue 156.4 132.1 +18.4% Cost of sales -45.1 -42.3 +6.7% Gross profit 111.3 89.8 +24.0% Gross margin 71.2% 68.0% +320 bps Operating expenses -68.4 -56.2 +21.7% Other operating income & expenses 3.0 0.0 Share of profit of equity-accounted investees* 0.3 1.0 -73.5% Operating profit 46.2 34.5 +33.8% Profit for the period 41.8 31.6 +32.6% Adjusted EBITDA 52.2 41.4 +26.1% Adjusted EBITDA margin 33.4% 31.3% +200 bps Adjusted FCF 43.8 26.7 +64.4% Cash Conversion Rate 84.0% 64.4% +1960 bps Net cash position** 142.6 120.1 +18.7%* Net of tax** Non-IFRS measure.

As a percentage of total revenue  cost of sales decreased by -320 basis points thanks to a continued strict monitoring of costs  in particular with respect to recruitment.This enabled Planisware to deliver a € 111.3 million gross profit (+24.0% year-on-year)  representing a 71.2% gross margin (i.e. cost of sales as a percentage of revenue)  a significant improvement byc. +320 basis points compared to 68.0% in 2022.Operating profit and profit for the periodR&D expenses  consisting primarily of staff expenses directly associated with R&D teams  as well as amortization of capitalized development costs and the benefits from the French research tax credit  represented 13% of total revenue and reached € 20.0 million  up by +9.1% compared to €18.3 million in 2022. Planisware intends to maintain a high level of R&D spending  as it believes that its ability to provide innovative products and software solutions  expand its offerings portfolio and promote its offerings in the project management market will have a considerable effect on its revenues and results of operations in the future.Reaching € 27.1 million in 2023 (17% of total revenue)  sales & marketing expenses increased by€+5.2 million  or +24.0%  compared to € 21.8 million in 2022  led in particular by the increase in employee-related costs in the salesforce and marketing team. Sales & marketing expenses are expected to increase in absolute amounts in the future as Planisware plans on expanding its domestic and international selling and marketing activities in order to strengthen its leading market position.General & administrative expenses reached € 21.3 million in 2023 (€+5.3 million  or +33.0% compared to € 16.0 million in 2022). This increase during the year was mostly related to employee costs engaged to support the growth of the business  the strengthening of global support functions  and the international expansion of the Group. Planisware expects that  as the Company continues to scale up in the future  General & administrative expenses will slightly decrease as a percentage of total revenue.As a results  operating profit reached € 46.2 million in 2023  up by +33.8% (or €+11.7 million)  compared to € 34.5 million in 2022.Reaching € 2.5 million in 2023  financial income slightly decreased compared to € 2.8 million in 2022  primarily driven by income from time deposits and realized and unrealized gains on marketable securities. These positive items were partially offset by the impact of the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the euro on cash and cash equivalents held in foreign currencies.At € 6.9 million  2023 income tax expense reflected an Effective Tax Rate of 14.1%  compared to 15.5% in 2022.As a result of these evolutions  profit for the period reached € 41.8 million in 2023  up by +32.6%compared to 2022.Adjusted EBITDAIn 2023  Adjusted EBITDA  which Planisware considers to be a meaningful financial measure to assess and compare the Group’s profitability  reached € 52.2 million  a strong increase compared to 2022 (€+10.8 million  or +26.1%). It represented 33.4% of 2023 total revenue  c. +200 basis points compared to 31.3% in 2022. The 2023 increase of Adjusted EBITDA reflects the translation of revenue growth into profit as the business grows from the addition of new customers  a positive mix effect and further operational efficiencies on employee-related costs and outsourcing optimization  including for R&D.Cash generation and net cash positionTax paid in 2023 was € 7.5 million compared to € 8.0 million in 2022  and capital expenditures totaled€ 4.9 million  representing 3.1% of total revenue  compared to € 4.8 million in 2022 (3.6% of total revenue). Change in working capital was €+3.6 million  compared to €-1.6 million in 2022.Planisware considers Cash Conversion Rate to be a meaningful financial measure to assess and compare the Group’s capital intensity and efficiency. In 2023  adjusted Free Cash Flow reached€ 43.8 million  up by +64.4% compared to € 26.7 million in 2022  led by Adjusted EBITDA growth. It represented a Cash Conversion Rate of 84%  above the 80% level that the Group considers being the normative Cash Conversion Rate for the coming years.Planisware benefits from a strong cash position  as most of its customers prepay for services  which generates structurally negative working capital requirements.As of December 31  2023  except lease liabilities related to offices and datacenter facilities which amounted to € 14.9 million (€ 14.5 million As of December 31  2022)  Planisware did not have any financial debt  compared to € 0.4 million as of December 31  2022. As a result  the Group’s net cash position* as of December 31  2023 amounted to € 142.6 million  compared to € 120.1 million as of December 31  2022.* Non-IFRS measure. Non-IFRS measures included in this document are defined in the disclaimer at the end of this document.Expanded customer basePlanisware welcomed in 2023 a significant number of new clients from a wide range of industries  further solidifying its position as a trusted partner for organizations of all sizes and diversifying the customer base. Recurring revenue growth is driven both by contracts with new customers and the expansion of Planisware’s solutions and services within its existing customer base.In 2023  Planisware customer loyalty has continued to remain high  with Planisware’s customer Net Retention Rate* (NRR) reaching 121%  reflecting Planisware ability to grow within its installed base.This is to be compared to a 2023 churn rate* of only 1.8% of revenue  achieved thanks to Planisware’ ability to leverage strong product capabilities  high industry recognition  leading to strong customer loyalty. These metrics are fully in line with Planisware’s objective to maintain a high level of customer NRR above 120% and a low level of churn rate below 2% in the coming years.Product enhancementsPlanisware continues to invest in product development to ensure cutting-edge project portfolio management solutions for its clients. In 2023  Planisware released several hundreds of enhancements and new features for its solution and continued to leverage its expertise on Artificial Intelligence to further empower the users to streamline project management and drive better decision-making.Among the key enhancements  Planisware significantly improved planning and work management capabilities for users of all experience levels with its module PM Go. Planisware PM Go provides both a very lean user experience as well as the ability to easily extend the data model. Project Managers can thus focus on their responsibilities and tasks with highly visual and collaborative features  while also directly modeling key aspects of their business in their planning  increasing solution ROI and stickiness.For most advanced use cases on the other hand  Planisware delivered a completely overhauled Monte- Carlo simulation model enabling strong risk assessment of plannings. With a significantly improved UX (User eXperience)  Planisware lets planners visually assess the level of confidence of scenarios and stress test schedules against objectives.2023 also saw the release of the latest version of Planisware’s mobile app  available on both iOS and Android  with enhanced user interface  making it even more visually appealing and intuitive to navigate. Featuring a larger scope of functionality  including advanced search options and one-tap updates on workflows  Planisware mobile app provides a speedy and responsive experience on the go  improving user interaction with the solution.Planisware introduced a Data Quality Audit (DQA) panel enabling users to quickly assess data quality as it is first entered and then iterated upon. Shipping with metrics mandated by the US Defense Contract Management Agency (DCMA)  Planisware DQA model is extensible and can accommodate a wide array of use cases and business requirements.Finally  Artificial Intelligence (AI) received continuous attention from Planisware  with the delivery of two additional AI-driven algorithms to the solution. First  Planisware Augmented Data Entry relies on generative AI algorithms to assist project managers and teams quickly generate project and plan activities  or establish early risk assessments.* Non-IFRS measure. Non-IFRS measures included in this document are defined in the disclaimer at the end of this document.Second AI feature  Planisware launched a Particle Swarm Portfolio Optimization (“PSO”) algorithm. PSO is a computational method inspired by social behavior  where individuals (particles) in a swarm collaborate to find the optimal solution. Derived from the collective intelligence observed in nature  this algorithm mimics social behavior to efficiently navigate through vast solution spaces and converge towards the best possible outcome. Planisware’s AI-driven PSO doesn't just optimize portfolios  it balances resources intelligently  ensuring optimal allocation across assets while considering constraints and objectives  as well as dynamically optimize project timing while ensuring both maximum efficiency and resource utilization.Planisware Orchestra was also improved with the 7.2.10 release introducing improvements for the Gantt display  and in the way that loads are distributed and the FTE computed  simplifying timesheet management for Resource managers and providing a clearer understanding of timesheet-related information.Third-party industry analysts recognitionPlanisware leverages the broad recognition from third-party industry analysts to attract and retain customers. In 2023  recognition of Planisware’s software high-quality  reliability and usefulness at competitive prices was further improved with Gartner having once more ranked Planisware as a Leader in Adaptive Project Management and Reporting (Gartner Magic Quadrant for Adaptive Project Management and Reporting – September 2023) and recognizing the Group as the sole “customers’ choice” in Gartner’s Voice of the Customer for Strategic Portfolio Management (October 2023). In addition  Info-Tech Research Group ranked Planisware #1 in its Emotional Footprint for Project Portfolio Management – Enterprise (August 2023).Corporate Social ResponsibilityOn the Corporate Social Responsibility front  Planisware made significant progress in 2023 and is determined to continue promoting CSR at all levels of its organization. In 2023  the Group has set up a governance structure for ESG topics  to ensure that they are taken up at all levels of the company in close relationship between operations and environmental  social and governance considerations. The Core Executive Board is in charge of identifying and prioritizing ESG risks and opportunities  as determined by risk mapping  to monitor risk mitigation and the exploitation of identified opportunities  through the development and implementation of dedicated policies and action plans  and internal control mechanisms to ensure that policies are properly applied and implemented. This organization reflects Planisware's ambition to place CSR at the heart of its management and strategy  at all levels of the company.A risk-based approach was followed in 2023 to define a universe of 11 environmental  social and societal  and governance risks. A scoring exercise for each of these risks was then carried out to identify the potential impact of each risk on 5 dimensions (reputational  legal  financial  human  and environmental). The risks identified as most significant were addressed by policies and action plans put in place to control and mitigate these risks  and evaluation methodologies to examine the results associated with these efforts.Planisware intends to publish soon its first Extra Financial Performance Statements to present this approach in detail and is already anticipating its forthcoming transition to CSRD  the new extra-financial reporting system to which the Group will soon be subject. The Group also plans to strengthen its CSR strategy  notably by drawing up a decarbonization strategy to be submitted to the independent and recognized Science Based Target (SBT) organization  and by responding to the CDP rating agency during the next financial year.Planisware is proud to have been certified  for the second year in a row  as a Great Place to Work® across all of its offices in 2023. This reflects Planisware's commitment to establish itself as an employer of choice on a global level by maintaining and strengthening its caring company culture and providing a stimulating and collaborative working environment. Additionally  as part of the annual Trust Index© Employee Survey  85% of Planiswarians responded positively to the Overall Perception question  which is 3 points above the comparative benchmark for software companies.2024 objectives confirmed and 2026 ambition reiteratedPlanisware’s ambition is to be the leading provider of multi-specialty project management software solutions. The Company benefits from multiple opportunities for value creation and further sustained growth. Through innovation and further branding and marketing initiatives  Planisware is well positioned to seize upsell and cross-sell opportunities  enlarge its market to new areas of project management  and develop adjacent segments within the broader Project Economy. Finally  Planisware developed concrete growth levers to enhance current pillars and expand to new functions  verticals  segments and geographies.Supported by its 2023 performance and the growth of its SaaS revenue in particular  the Company forecasts year-on-year total revenue growth in constant currencies of approximately 19.5% in 2024. The Group also reiterates its ambition to achieve annual total revenue year-on-year growth in constant currencies of more than 20% in 2026.In addition  the Group forecasts an Adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 33% for 2024  in line with the Adjusted EBITDA margin recorded for 2023. It also reiterates its ambition to attain an Adjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 35% in 2026.Planisware has the objective to deliver its normative Cash Conversion Rate at approximately 80% in 2024 and onwards.Finally  subject to the approval of the Annual General Meeting of the Company’s shareholders and the effective listing of the Company  the Group intends to apply  in the medium term  a dividend policy distributing a yearly dividend representing 40% of its profit for the period.Postponed IPO on Euronext ParisIn 2023  Planisware initiated the next phase of its growth strategy through its contemplated IPO on Euronext Paris. A public listing would enable Planisware to further enhance market visibility and brand awareness  pursue its growth strategy and consolidate its leading market position while continuing to expand its global presence with a proven go-to-market strategy.Despite the strong engagement and interest from investors  Planisware announced on October 11  2023 its decision to postpone its initial public offering (IPO) on Euronext Paris due to adverse market conditions  worsened in the last days before the planned listing.The Company remains convinced that a listing would be an important step for its future development and continues to monitor market conditions to seize the right timing opportunity. In the meantime  it is committed to keep delivering on its strategy  pursuing its objectives and continuing its history of growth and value creation.ContactInvestors & analysts Benoit d’Amécourtbenoit.damecourt@planisware.com+33 6 75 51 41 47MediaHugues Boëton / Tristan Roquet Montégon+33 6 79 99 27 15 / +33 6 37 00 52 57planisware@brunswickgroup.comAbout PlaniswarePlanisware is a leading business-to-business (“B2B”) provider of Software-as-a-Service (“SaaS”) in the rapidly growing Project Economy.

Non-IFRS financial information may exclude certain items contained in the nearest IFRS financial measure or include certain non-IFRS components. Readers should not consider items which are not recognized measurements under IFRS as alternatives to the applicable measurements under IFRS. These measures have limitations as analytical tools and readers should not treat them as substitutes for IFRS measures. In particular  readers should not consider such measurements of the Group’s financial performance or liquidity as an alternative to profit for the period  operating income or other performance measures derived in accordance with IFRS or as an alternative to cash flow from (used in) operating activities as a measurement of the Group’s liquidity. Other companies with activities similar to or different from those of the Group could calculate non-IFRS measures differently from the calculations adopted by the Group.Non-IFRS measures included in this document are defined as follows:Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as Current operating profit including share of profit of equity- accounted investees  plus amortization and depreciation as well as impairment of intangible assets and property  plant and equipment  plus either non-recurring items or non-operating items defined as the following: (i) share-based payment expenses under IFRS 2 (ii) any expenses  charges or other costs directly or indirectly related to any initial public offering  equity offering  investment  acquisition  joint venture or partnerships (iii) certain consulting fees incurred for one-off projects  such as reorganization measures; and (iv) certain severance payments  which includes expenses related to reorganization and restructuring measures  primarily consisting of severance payments and other personnel-related costs. For the year ended December 31  2022  these adjustments for non-recurring items or non-operating items related to external costs incurred by the Group in connection with its planned initial public offering.Adjusted EBITDA margin is the ratio of Adjusted EBITDA to total revenue. Adjusted FCF (Free Cash Flow) is calculated as cash flows from operating activities  plus IPO costs paid  if any  less other financial income and expenses classified as operating activities in the cash-flow statement  and less net cash relating to capital expenditures. Management considers Adjusted Free Cash Flow to be a liquidity measure that provides useful information to stakeholders. Cash Conversion Rate is defined as Adjusted FCF divided by Adjusted EBITDA. . Planisware considers Cash Conversion Rate to be a meaningful financial measure to assess and compare the Group’s capital intensity and efficiency.Net cash position is defined as Cash minus indebtedness excluding lease liabilities. Net Retention Rate (NRR) is defined as the percentage calculated (in constant currencies) by dividing (i) the recurring revenue in a given year from existing customers that have maintained contracts with Planisware for at least one year by (ii) the recurring revenue from these customers in the prior year. Churn rate is defined as the percentage of revenue calculated (in constant currencies) by dividing (i) the Year N-1 recurring revenue generated by terminating customers of year “N” by(ii) the Year N recurring revenue generated by recurring customers existing at the beginning of year N.Forward-looking statementsThis document contains statements regarding the prospects and growth strategies of Planisware.

This handover is accompanied by the transfer of some 350 employees specializing in the industrial water cycle.The transfer operations were completed at the end of 2023 and gave rise to significant non-recurring expenses  in particular those relating to the remuneration of Groupe Veolia for several commercial and administrative management services it continued to provide during the transfer period.Financial performance in line with 2024-2026 roadmap objectivesConfirmation of organic growth momentum  particularly in FranceAt December 31  2023  Séché Environnement posted contributed revenue of €1 013.5m  up +6.4% at constant scope and exchange rates compared with 2022.Over the period  business was driven by markets in France (73.9% of contributed revenue)  where the Group confirmed its continued sales momentum in most of its markets  while internationally  sales varied according to geographical region and subsidiary.France: robust sales in positively oriented marketsAs an integrated operator in the circular economy and environmental services sectors  Séché Environnement benefits in France from markets that are sustainably driven by regulatory changes promoting the circular economy  the fight against climate change and the challenges of ensuring the environmental safety of industrial infrastructures.In 2023  the Group experienced buoyant industrial markets  particularly in areas linked to circular economy and services  while the extension of its offering in particular with the integration of new Services businesses - such as industrial water management - has fostered the implementation of intra-Group industrial and commercial synergies that have boosted the Group's growth momentum.Contracts with local authorities confirmed their resilience in an environment characterized by high utilization of waste recovery and treatment facilities and the continuation of a very positive price dynamic.In addition  the Group benefited from a significant rise in energy sales prices  in line with the full effect of the indexation of its energy sales contracts in 2022 (steam sales in particular).Overall  Séché Environnement posted very substantial organic growth in France  up 9.4% on the previous year  illustrating the relevance of Séché Environnement's commercial offering to the challenges of environmental safety and sustainability for economic players  as well as to short-term imperatives in terms of access to resources  materials and energy.International: performance varies by subsidiaryInternationally  Séché Environnement has a presence in targeted geographical areas through some of its businesses  giving the Group greater exposure to certain markets and/or local customer bases  and making the contribution of the various subsidiaries less homogeneous.In 2023  most international markets remained buoyant  underpinned by the good level of activity of local industrial customers  as illustrated by the remarkable performance of South American subsidiaries and the solid contribution of European subsidiaries.However  some subsidiaries reported a decline in business compared with their particularly high levels of activity in 2022  such as in South Africa  where Spill Tech had recorded exceptionally large-scale environmental emergency contracts  or Solarca  a specialist in chemical cleaning  which had benefited last year from a strong recovery in its order book following the pandemic years.The international scope also recorded a strongly negative exchange rate effect  of (€16.3)m vs. a positive exchange rate effect of +€4.5m in 2022  essentially due to the deterioration in the parity of the South African Rand.As a result  revenue is slightly down on 2022  by (0.8)% at constant scope and exchange rates.Operating income up: strong contribution from historical scopeThe 2023 financial year sees a further increase in consolidated operating income  particularly for the historical scope in France  where operating profitability  both gross and current  will be significantly higher than in 2022.As a result  earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization (EBITDA) reached €217.7m  or 21.5% of contributed revenue  up 8.0% on a reported basis (vs. €201.6m  or 22.6% of contributed revenue in 2022).At constant scope  it came to €218.4m  a significant organic increase of +10.1% to 23.3% of contributed revenue (vs. 22.6% of contributed revenue a year ago).The increase in gross operating profitability reflects the solid contribution of the France scope:EBITDA in France rose organically by +18.8% to €176.7m  or 25.7% of contributed revenue  marking a significant improvement in gross operating profitability compared with last year (23.6% of contributed revenue).In addition to favorable commercial effects (volume and price effects)  EBITDA in France reflects the positive impact of the industrial efficiency policy on tool availability and organizational productivity.This further increase in gross operating profitability to historically high levels also illustrates Séché Environnement's ability to rapidly onboard the new scopes acquired in recent years and to raise their profitability to Group standards.This performance is all the more remarkable in that the increase in this balance is limited in 2023  to the tune of (€9.4)m by the cap on infra-marginal profits of electricity producers introduced by the Finance Law for 2023 (with a negative impact of €5.8m from 2022)  reducing gains on electricity sales to +€2.6m.International EBITDA fell organically by -15.9% to €41.7m  or 16.8% of contributed revenue (vs. €52.9m to 19.9% of contributed revenue in 2022).The lower contribution from international activities is mainly due to delays in activity at certain subsidiaries (notably Spill Tech and Solarca) given that the gross operating profitability of the international scope in 2022 had been boosted by the contribution of major environmental emergency contracts on an exceptional scale  amounting to €5m.Current operating income (COI) came to €101.2m  or 10.0% of contributed revenue  up 10.8% on a reported basis compared to 2022 (€91.3m  or 10.2% of contributed revenue).At constant scope  growth continued strong (+17.8% at constant exchange rates) to €105.1m  or 11.2% of contributed revenue. This increase in current operating profitability reflects the solid performance of the France scope:Current operating income for France reached €85.9m  or 12.5% of contributed revenue (vs. 9.8% of contributed revenue in 2022  reflecting organic growth in EBITDA  mainly offset by a moderate increase in depreciation and provisions  in line with tight control over capital expenditure and the quality of the customer receivables portfolio.reached €85.9m  or 12.5% of contributed revenue (vs. 9.8% of contributed revenue in 2022  reflecting organic growth in EBITDA  mainly offset by a moderate increase in depreciation and provisions  in line with tight control over capital expenditure and the quality of the customer receivables portfolio. International current operating income came to €19.2m  or 7.7% of contributed revenue (vs. €29.6m  or 11.1% of contributed revenue in 2022). This decline is essentially due to the weaker performance of International EBITDA at constant scope and exchange rates.Operating income reached €91.4m  or 9.0% of contributed revenue  up +5.1% on a reported basis and +12.2% at constant scope and exchange rates compared with last year.This change reflects the increase in operating income  mainly offset by impairments on intangible assets of (€7.1m). These impairments are mainly due to the non-utilization of developments carried out as part of the roll-out of the French ERP following tests carried out by pilot companies in the second half of 2023.Further increase in net income  Group share - Proposed dividend upNet financial incomeAt December 31  2023  net financial income stood at (€22.2m)  compared with (€18.5m) at the end of 2022  up 20.0% year-on-year.This change mainly reflects:The increase in the cost of gross indebtedness  to (€26.1m) vs. (€17.8m) a year ago  due to a rise in the cost of gross debt to 3.49% vs. 2.56% in 2022  and the increase in average gross financial debt over the period (see below).The improvement in ""Other financial income and expenses""  at +€0.9m vs. (€1.5)m in 2022  (€1.5m) in 2022  mainly due to the recognition of accretion income on the provision for thirty-year risk  amounting to +€2.3m (vs. an expense of (€0.5m) a year ago).Income taxAt December 31  2023  ""Income taxes"" amounted to (€17.8m) vs. (€19.2m) in 2022  giving an effective tax rate of 25.8% vs. 28.1%.Consolidated net incomeAfter accounting for the share in net income of associated companies  i.e. (€1.3m) at December 31  2023  an amount identical to that for 2022  net income for the consolidated group came to €50.0m vs. €47.9m in 2022.Net of non-controlling interests of (€2.2m)  Group share of net income came to €47.8m  or 4.7% of contributed revenue at December 31  2023 (vs. €44.6m  or 5.0% of contributed revenue in 2022).Net income per share came to €6.13 vs. €5.72 at December 31  2022.The dividend will be raised from €1.10 to €1.20 per share  subject to approval by the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on April 26  2024. It will be withdrawn on July 8  2024 for payment on July 10  2024.Confirmation of solid financial positionFree operating cash flow came to €101.3m  up 29.2% compared with 2022 (€78.4m)  with an EBITDA-to-cash conversion rate of 47% (vs. 39% a year ago). This positive trend is mainly due to tight control over capital expenditure and a significant reduction in working capital requirements.Booked capital expenditure totaled €97.2m  or 9.6% of contributed revenue (vs. €105.0m in 2022  or 11.7% of contributed revenue):Recurring capital expenditure (or maintenance) totaled €68.2m  or 6.7% of contributed revenue (vs. €57.4m in 2022  i.e.  6.4% of contributed revenue)  with the slight year-on-year increase mainly due to periodic ""major maintenance and repairs"" expenses.Non-recurring investment (or development investment) came to €29.0m  or 2.9% of contributed revenue (vs. 47.6m in 2022  or 5.3% of contributed revenue)  and mainly concern growth investments in the Circular Economy and Services businesses.The change in working capital requirement stood at (€6.3)m  a sharp improvement on the (€-25.1)m recorded in 2022  illustrating the success of the Group's efforts to return to a more normative situation with regard to business growth  and despite the consequences of the cyber-attack in spring 2023 on billing and collection management.Cash balance amounted to €162.2m  vs. €126.2m a year earlier  a +28.5% variation reflecting the good level of free cash flow generated in 2023 - excluding acquisitions. The liquidity position is solid  at €332.2m at December 31  2023 vs. €313.1m by the end of 2022.Net financial debt stood at €641.9m vs. €587.4m at December 31  2022. This +€54.5m increase reflects:(€43.3m) to reduce the Group's debt at constant scope and before non-cash effects.+€35.5m: a non-cash change - at constant scope – mainly linked to new IFRS 16 contracts.+€62.3m  the scope effects (disbursements for the fair value of the shares and financial leases of acquired companies).Financial leverage ratio stood at 2.9 times EBITDA vs. 2.8 times a year earlier. Excluding acquisitions completed by the end of 2023  it would have been 2.7 times EBITDA  in line with Group targets.Solid non-financial performance in 202311In fiscal 2023  Séché Environnement stepped up its non-financial strategy  particularly in the areas of combating climate change  water and energy efficiency  and protecting biodiversity.In particular  the Group has:Obtained SBTi approval of its climate trajectory.In January 2023  the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi) approved Séché Environnement's GHG emissions reduction target. SBTi thus recognizes that the target set by Séché Environnement is based on scientific criteria and in line with the Paris Agreement on combating global warming  which aims to limit global warming to 2°C by 2050. Séché Environnement's decarbonization strategy aims to achieve an absolute reduction of -25% in direct greenhouse gas emissions (scope 1) and indirect emissions linked to energy consumption (scope 2) between 2020 and 2030.Confirmed the high rates of eligibility and alignment of its activity with the European green taxonomy.Séché Environnement has a sustainable business model as defined by the European green taxonomy.On the basis of the six delegated acts published by the European Commission on June 5  2023  the percentages of eligibility and alignment of the company's activities with the achievement of the 6 environmental objectives reach 84% and 70% of revenue respectively at December 31  2023.These figures are well above the average for economic activities in Europe (estimated alignment at 20%)12  illustrating the company's contribution to the greening of the economy.Achieved by 2023 the GHG emissions reduction target set for its 2025 Climate trajectory.With greenhouse gas emissions reduced to just 555ktCO 2 eq in 2023  Séché Environnement is two years ahead of schedule in meeting the greenhouse gas emissions reduction target set in 2021 for 2025.This indicator is included as an impact criterion for its November 2021 bond issue  i.e.  a 10% reduction in scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions for the France 2020 scope.With a performance of +29% in 2023 in terms of greenhouse gases avoided  Séché Environnement is also well on the way to achieving its second objective set by its Climate strategy: a +40% increase in emissions avoided by materials recovery activities in the France 2020 scope.2024 OUTLOOK ON TRACK - OBJECTIVES CONFIRMEDROADMAP TO 2026 REINFORCEDSéché Environnement confirms its financial and non-financial roadmap for 2024 to 202613.A solid position in the sustainable growth markets of environmental transition and sustainable developmentSéché Environnement is active in the highly regulated French and international environmental transition and sustainable development markets  and benefits from the trend towards tighter regulatory constraints imposed on economic players to reduce their environmental footprint.Séché's activities in fact address the long-term issues facing economic players in terms of ecological transition  and in particular climate change  the depletion of natural resources and the protection of biodiversity.The Group's activities in rare resource reuse and the production of recovered energy also provide solutions to the short-term challenges faced by local communities and manufacturers in terms of access to raw materials  water and energy. These resources are regenerated and low in carbon  made available locally and at competitive prices.For all these reasons  they boast strong visibility  sustained growth  high and rising operating margins  and proven resilience.Séché backs up this strategy of organic growth with an active policy of external growth  both in France and internationally  where the Group has taken leading commercial positions in certain geographical areas  such as Northern Italy and Southern Africa.The breadth of its offering  the resulting cross-selling synergies  and the regulatory changes impacting its markets  enable the Group to anticipate organic growth over the period well in excess of forecast GDP growth rates in the geographical areas in which it operates.Continued strong organic growth over the 2024 - 2026 period.In France  the Group's business should be buoyed by the dynamic markets of the Circular economy and  above all  Industrial Services.In Circular economy markets  Séché will focus on developing its capacities in the field of energy recovery from non-hazardous waste against a backdrop of a trend of declining treatment capacity  and material recovery from hazardous waste.In the Services markets  Séché will benefit from a buoyant regulatory environment and from the growth dynamic resulting from its new offering in the industrial water cycle businesses and from the expected cross-fertilization with the Group's other activities and customer bases. The Group will also benefit from the growth momentum of its ""global offers""  a delegated management service for industrial customers.Internationally  the Group is confident in its ability to maintain solid growth  and in particular:In Italy  where the new Mecomer-Furia group offers powerful commercial and industrial synergies  making Séché one of the leading operators in the hazardous waste market.In Southern Africa (South Africa and Namibia)  where the Group offers the most comprehensive range of waste management and environmental safety solutions for industrial customers through its subsidiaries with complementary skills: Interwaste  Spill Tech and Rent-A-Drum.The Group is also confident in its ability to take advantage of the positive trend in its Latin American markets  where it has strengthened its position in emergency environmental services with the recent acquisition of Essac in Peru.For the 2024 financial year  Séché Environnement anticipates organic growth in contributed revenue of around 5%  to which will be added the contribution of the scopes acquired in 2023 of around €60m  for contributed revenue of around €1 100m.By 2026  and on this basis  Séché anticipates contributed revenue of around €1 200m  representing an average organic growth rate of around +5% over the period.Improvement in gross and recurring operating profitability between 2024 and 2026The Group will work across all scopes to pursue its strategy of industrial efficiency  based on rigorous requirements in terms of safety  regulatory compliance and operational excellence.In this context  the Group is implementing a productivity plan which enables it to anticipate:Improvement in the utilization rate of its industrial and logistics facilities.Control of industrial investment: this should stabilize over the period at around the levels reached in 2023  i.e. between €100 and €110m per year.In 2026  the normalized investment rate would be around 9% of contributed revenue (vs. 10% previously)  of which around 3% relates to maintenance investment  around 2% to safety and regulatory capital expenditure (i.e. a total of around 5% maintenance capital expenditure)  and around 4% to development capital expenditure.Séché will implement other levers to boost its gross and current operating profitability  such as optimizing the profitability of its new business scopes (particularly in the industrial water cycle)  pursuing its industrial efficiency plan or controlling its operating expenses through a savings plan of the order of €20m over the period (at constant scope).Lastly  the prevalence of Services activities in the business mix should lead to faster growth in current operating income than EBITDA over the period.For 2024  Séché Environnement anticipates EBITDA of around €230m and current operating income of around €105m.The Group has targets for 2026 of:EBITDA of between €265 and €275m  i.e. gross operating profitability of between 22% and 23% of contributed revenue.A current operating income of between €132 and €144m  i.e. an operational profitability level of between 11% and 12% of contributed revenue.Maximized free cash flow generation.Séché strive to maximize its free cash flow generation14 by controlling its investments around their current level  neutralizing its change in working capital requirements on average over the period  and an appropriate dividend policy.For 2024  Séché Environnement anticipates a financial leverage ratio of less than 2.7 X EBITDA (excluding acquisitions).Over the period 2024 to 2026  the Group intends to generate free cash flow of at least €250m over the period 2024 to 2026 (excluding acquisitions).New 2026 non-financial commitments.On the strength of its ability to combine economic growth with a reduction in the environmental impact of its customers  Séché Environnement has set itself new non-financial objectives for 2026:Pursue the decarbonization of its activities : -13% greenhouse gas emissions 15 (in line with the target approved by SBTi in early 2023).: -13% greenhouse gas emissions (in line with the target approved by in early 2023). Consolidate its ability to decarbonize its customers by increasing material recycling activities: +50% of greenhouse gases avoided.by increasing material recycling activities: +50% of greenhouse gases avoided. Improving energy efficiency : -12% reduction in energy consumption.: -12% reduction in energy consumption. Increasing energy resilience : 310% energy self-sufficiency.: 310% energy self-sufficiency. Reduce the water consumption of its activities : -13% reduction in water consumption.: -13% reduction in water consumption. Preserving biodiversity: 80% progress on its Act4Nature action plan.These various objectives will help to reduce the environmental impact of Séché Environnement  as well as that of its customers  reinforcing the Group's position as a key player in the environmental transition.Webcast presentation of results March 12  2024 at 8:30 a.m. sharpLogin to the Séché Environnement home pageIn French: https://www.groupe-seche.com/frIn English: https://www.groupe-seche.com/enNext release1st quarter 2024 sales: April 23  2024 after market closeCombined General Meeting of Shareholders April 26  2024Séché Environnement is a leading player in waste management  including the most complex and hazardous waste  and in environmental services  particularly in the event of an environmental emergency.

Furthermore  in view of the forthcoming change of control  the Group is not publishing a new 2024 outlook. The Consortium's business plan Consortium was communicated to the market on 21 December 2023 and appended to the Accelerated Safeguard Plan. It takes into account the Group's refocusing on Monoprix  Franprix  convenience stores and Cdiscount  and aims to improve the Group's profitability through: (i) adopting a policy of permanent low prices  improving the customer experience and service quality  increasing the visibility and attractiveness of the banners  enriching the assortment and setting up partnerships  increasing the singularity of the banners  boosting growth via franchising and the conversion of directly-operated stores  and accelerating Cdiscount's transition to a marketplace model. In 2024  the Consortium targets a positive EBITDA (after rentals) of 126 million euros  net capital expenditure of -354 million euros and operating cash flow before disposals of -655 million  taking into account the normalization of WCR. In the medium term  the Consortium's business plan shows a gradual improvement in the Group's profitability  driven by the implementation of the above-mentioned operating levers and the implementation of an investment plan of almost -1.6 billion euros over the plan's duration  notably with a view to renovating the store base. By the end of the plan in 2028  EBITDA adjusted (after rentals) should improve significantly to 920 million euros  while other operating items and expenses should stabilize at around -50 million euros. As a result  the Consortium forecasts operating cash flow before disposals of 443 million euros  higher than the annual interest expense of around -230 million euros. Finally  net financial debt at the end of this plan would amount to 1 960 million euros  representing a financial leverage of 2.1x.2.3 - What are the issuer's specific risks?An investment in the Company's securities involves numerous risks and uncertainties related to the Group's activities that could result in a partial or total loss of the investment for investors. The main risks  which the Group considers to be the most significant in terms of their potential impact and probability of occurrence  are as follows: Competitive intensity (very significant risk) : The Group operates in highly competitive markets  particularly in France. In e-commerce  the Group  and in particular Cdiscount  faces competition from international players  notably American. Competition is generally focused on outlet location  product quality  service  price (exacerbated by the inflationary context)  product diversity  brand reputation and store condition. In addition  the Group's ability to adapt its business models to customer expectations is a major challenge. Business disruption/interruption (very significant risk) : Risk of business disruption/interruption within the Group  this encompasses the risks of supply disruption  inaccessibility of sites  and destruction/damage to buildings. Supply chain’s efficiency and smooth running are essential. Changes in the Group's logistical structures may lead to an interruption of operations  store shortages and disruption to inventory management. Catastrophic events and other types of events could have a negative effect on the Group's business. The Paris Olympic and Paralympic Games (JOP) are likely to disrupt store operations in the Île-de-France region and at regional competition venues. Franchising risks (very significant risk) : Operating stores under franchise has been one of the Group's development strategies. In France  by the end of 2023  79% of our stores will be operated under franchise or lease management  and in particular 90% of the Casino proximity network. Excluding HM/SM  83% of the Group's store base is operated under franchise or lease management. The Group aims to accelerate its expansion in the convenience sector by 2024  relying primarily on franchising. In view of the sale of the hypermarkets and supermarkets division and the franchise development plan  the proportion of stores operated under franchise or lease management is set to rise to 90% over the next few years. This form of development has the advantage of significantly reducing the investments required to develop the store network  since these are largely borne by the franchisees. However  it also presents risks for the franchisor  the main ones being: (i) image  (ii) poorly controlled development  (iii) financial  (iv) legal and (v) competitive and administrative risks. Risks relating to information systems and cybercrime (very significant risk) : The Group operates a large network of information systems that are essential to the performance and management of its activities. The development  implementation and continuous  uninterrupted operation of these information systems are an important element in the ability to deliver products and services to customers for all the Group's banners  in particular for Cdiscount's operations  as well as for the digital advertising and data center businesses  RelevanC and ScaleMax. These risks also affect stores and warehouses  via critical information systems. International tensions in Eastern Europe and the Middle East  as well as the organization of the Olympic Games in France in 2024  could lead to an upsurge in cyber-attacks on French companies. Risks linked to the economic context (very significant risk) : The Group's business  and in particular its sales  operating income and cash flow generated  are strongly correlated with consumer spending. This spending is affected by economic cycles. In particular  inflation could continue to have an impact on purchasing power  consumption patterns and consumer spending. Current international tensions could continue to drive up the cost of raw materials. Latin American economies have historically been subject to sharp variations in their level of activity. In addition  the Group could be adversely affected by exchange rate movements (rise in the dollar against the euro). What's more  the Group's activities will be mainly concentrated in France following completion of the plan to sell off its South American entities  which makes it vulnerable to France's specific economic context. In France  in Q3 2023  (i) the unemployment rate will rise again  and (ii) INSEE has measured a downward trend in household purchasing power. Liquidity (very significant risk) : In the absence of completion of the Financial Restructuring  the Company would not be in a position to meet its future obligations over the next twelve months  and its ability to continue as a going concern would therefore be compromised. Such situation could lead to the opening of receivership or compulsory winding-up proceedings  which could lead to the sale of all or part of the Company's assets  and could place (i) shareholders in the position of losing their entire investment in the Company  and (ii) creditors in the situation of reduced prospects of recovering their receivables. At 31 December 2023  the Group's cash position amounted to 1 051 million euros. Increased by the cash generated by the disposal of the Éxito group in January 2024 for a net amount of 357 million euros  the Group covers its liquidity needs for the 1st quarter of 2024  estimated at 600 million euros. Risks relating to compliance with laws and regulations (very significant risk) : With a particularly extensive supply chain  and given the nature of the Group's activities and its international presence  the Group is exposed to the risk of legal action  particularly in respect of the Sapin II law pertaining to the fight against corruption  the law relating to the duty of care of parent companies and principals and non-compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (RGPD). The protection of data concerning the Group's customers and employees is also a major issue to which the Group pays particular attention. Exposure to this risk is heightened by the development of e-commerce activities and the increasing digitization of data media. Both in France and abroad  the Group is subject to all legislation and regulations governing the operation of establishments open to the public.Section 3 - Key information on securities3.1 - What are

According to the indicative timetable  the New Shares issued in connection with the Reserved Share Capital Increases will be admitted to trading on this market as from 27 March 2024. They will be immediately assimilated to the existing shares already traded on Euronext Paris and will be tradable  as from this date  on the same trading line under ISIN Code FR0000125585. The Warrants #1 and the Warrants #3 will be tradable on Euronext Paris from their Issue Date respectively  under ISIN Codes FR001400OJ72 and ISIN FR001400OJ98 respectively. No application for admission to trading on another regulated market has been or will be made. The Warrants #2 and the Warrants Additional Shares will not be the subject of an application for admission to trading on any regulated or unregulated market. They will be freely tradable and will be the subject of a request for admission to trading by Euroclear France  which will ensure their clearing between account holders-custodians. The Warrants constitute securities giving access to the share capital within the meaning of articles L. 228-91 et seq. of the French Commercial Code. No application has been made or is contemplated to be made by the Company for them to be admitted to trading on another market (regulated or not). The New Shares resulting from the exercise of the Warrants will be subject to periodic requests for admission to trading on Euronext Paris and will be tradable on the same trading line as the existing Shares.3.3 - Are securities covered by a guarantee?The Reserved Share Capital Increases are not secured by a bank syndicate or underwriting agreement. They are subscribed under the Accelerated Safeguard Plan. Similarly  the issue of Warrants is underwritten by application of the Accelerated Safeguard Plan. These commitments do not constitute a performance guarantee (garantie de bonne fin) within the meaning of Article L. 225-145 of the French Commercial Code.3.4 - What are the main risks specific to securities?The main risk factors relating to the New Shares (including those issued upon exercise of the Warrants) and the Warrants are set out below. The Group has assessed the significance of the specific risks to which it believes it is exposed on the basis of the likelihood of their materialization and the estimated magnitude of their negative impact after taking into account the action plans in place. The most significant risk factors according to the above assessment are indicated first and marked with an asterisk. Existing Casino shareholders will suffer significant dilution of their interest in the Company's share capital as a result of the completion of the Issuances and the exercise of the Warrants *: The implementation of the Issuances should be completed by the end of the first quarter 2024 and the exercise of the Warrants contemplated under the financial restructuring plan will result in significant dilution for existing Casino shareholders. As an indication  a shareholder holding 1% of the Company's share capital would see his shareholding decrease (on a diluted basis)  post completion of the Reserved Share Capital Increases  to 0.003% of the Company's share capital and 0.003% post exercise of all the Warrants. In view of the very large number of Shares and Warrants issued in connection with the Issuances  sales of a significant number of Shares or Warrants could occur rapidly from the date of completion of the Issuances  or such sales could be anticipated by the market  which could have an unfavorable impact on the market price of the Shares and/or the market price of the Warrants *: The completion of the Issuances and the exercise of the Warrants would lead to the issuance of a significant number of Shares and to a significant change in the shareholder structure. Sales of a significant number of the Shares or Warrants could occur rapidly from the completion date of the Issuances  or such sales could be anticipated by the market given the absence of a lock-up commitment for some beneficiaries of the Reserved Share Capital Increases  which could have an unfavorable impact on the market price of the Share and/or of each category of Warrants. It is therefore highly likely that the post-Warrants issue and exercise share price will be close to the issue price of the Reserved Share Capital Increases and the exercise of the Warrants  thus having a lasting impact on the company's share price and the group’s capital market financing. Volatility and liquidity of the Shares and Warrants may fluctuate significantly *: Stock markets have experienced significant fluctuations unrelated to the results of the concerned companies  which could increase the volatility of the Shares  cumulated to their low unit value prior completion of the Reverse Share Split. The liquidity of the market for the Shares could be reduced as a result of the capital ownership structure on completion of the Financial Restructuring transactions. No assurance can be given that a market will develop for the Warrants #1 and the Warrants #3 on Euronext Paris and  if it does develop  it may offer only limited liquidity and be subject to high volatility. Holders of the Warrants #1 and the Warrants #3  as the case may be  who do not wish to exercise them may not be able to sell them on the market. The market price of the said Warrants #1 and the Warrants #3 will depend in particular on the market price of the Shares and  in the event of a decline in the market price of the Shares  the value of these Warrants could decrease. In addition  trades between institutional investors involving large quantities are generally executed off-market. Consequently  not all investors may have access to this type of transaction and  in particular  to their pricing conditions. The market price of the Shares could fluctuate and fall below the subscription price of the New Shares issued upon exercise of the Warrants  and if this fall were to occur after the exercise of the Warrants by their holders  the latter would suffer a loss in the event of immediate sale of the said New Shares* : No assurance can be given that  during the Exercise Period of the Warrants  the market price of the shares will be higher than or equal to the exercise price of the Warrants nor  consequently  that the Warrant Holders will be able to acquire additional shares in the Company's share capital at an attractive price. If the share price were to fall after the exercise of the Warrants by their holders  the latter would suffer a loss in the event of immediate sale of the Shares received. Thus  no assurance can be given that  subsequent to the exercise of the Warrants  investors will be able to sell their Shares at a price equal to or greater than the exercise price of the Warrants. Risk of lapsing and loss of value of the Warrants : Warrants that have not been exercised by the expiry date of their Exercise Period will lapse and lose all value and rights attached thereto. The terms and conditions of each category of Warrants may be modified and such modifications would be binding on all their respective holders : The terms and conditions of each category of Warrants may be modified  subject to the authorization of a special meeting of the holders of each of the categories of warrants concerned  deciding  in accordance with current regulations  by a two-thirds majority of the votes of the holders present or represented at said meeting. Any amendment so approved will be binding upon all Holders of Warrants #1  Holders of Warrants #2  Holders of Warrants #3 or Holders of Warrants Additional Shares  as the case may be. The terms and conditions of each category of Warrants are based on the laws and regulations in force at the date of this document. Legislative or regulatory developments could have the effect of modifying the terms and conditions of each category of Warrants  which could have an impact on their value. No assurance can be given as to the impact of such potential changes after the date of this document. The holders of each category of Warrants benefit from limited anti-dilution protection : The exercise ratio of each category of Warrants will be adjusted in the only cases provided for by their terms and conditions of said Warrants and in accordance with the provisions of the French Commercial Code. Accordingly  the exercise ratio of each category of Warrants will not necessarily be adjusted in all cases where an event relating to the Company or any other event is likely to affect the value of the Shares or  more generally  to have a dilutive impact. Events for which no adjustment is foreseen could have a negative impact on the value of the Shares and  consequently  on that of the Warrants.Section 4 - Key information on admission to trading on a regulated market for securities4.1 - Under what conditions and according to what timetable can I invest in this security?Conditions to the transaction: The approval of the Accelerated Safeguard Plan by the class of shareholders of the Company  meeting as a class of affected parties on 11 January 2024  entailed approval by the class of shareholders of all the resolutions included in the appendix to the Accelerated Safeguard Plan  delegating powers to the Company's Board of Directors  notably for the purpose of carrying out the Issuances.Reserved Share Capital Increases: The Reserved Share Capital Increases will be carried out through the waiver of the shareholders’ preferential subscription rights in favor of beneficiaries mentioned in section 3.1.1 of this Summary.

The impact of the restructuring on control of the Company is more fully described in section 2 of the URD. A shareholders’ agreement would be entered into between the shareholders of France Retail Holdings. On 9 January 2024  the AMF granted an exemption from the obligation for the members of the Consortium acting in concert and their investment vehicle (France Retail Holdings) to file a draft public offer for Casino shares.Estimated expenses related to the Reserved Share Capital Increase and the Warrants issues: For information purposes  all expenses related to the restructuring (including expenses related to the Reserved Share Capital Increases and the Warrants issues) are currently estimated at an amount of approximately 125 million euros  of which 40 million euros were paid at 31 December 2023. In addition  the Unsecured Creditors and the Perpetual Creditors having acceded to the Lock-up Agreement at the latest on the Last Accession Date will benefit from a specific support fee on the Effective Restructuring Date (for a total amount of approximately 6 8 million euros). It is specified that the expenses relating to the Reserved Share Capital Increases and the issuance of the Warrants will be financed exclusively from the Group's available cash and the setting up of new financing lines.Expenses billed to the investor by the Company: Not applicable4.2 - Why is this prospectus being prepared?This Prospectus has been prepared in connection with the admission of the New Shares and Warrants #1 and Warrants #3 to trading on Euronext Paris. The information contained in this Prospectus allows to restore  in all material respects and as far as necessary  equal access between the various shareholders and investors to information relating to the Company. It is reminded that the Issuances will result from the implementation of the Accelerated Safeguard Plan. With the exception of the Reverse Share Split and Share Capital Reduction No. 2  all transactions provided for in the Accelerated Safeguard Plan  form an indissociable whole  so that if one of the transactions were not to be carried out  none of them would be implemented. The Accelerated Safeguard Plan is expected to be implemented by 30 April 2024 at the latest  or such other date as may be determined in accordance with the Accelerated Safeguard Plan and the Lock-up Agreement.Reason for Issuances and use of proceeds: Context of Issuances: Fiscal year 2022 and the first semester 2023 were characterized by high inflation in food prices  leading the Group to face a decline in sales in its HM/SM due to losses in market share as a result of a pricing policy superior to that of its competitors. Furthermore  operating cash flow generation in France before implementation of the asset disposal plan for 2022 was negative at 524m euros. In this context  on 5 October 2023  the Group entered into a lock-up agreement (the ""Lock-up Agreement"") relating to its Financial Restructuring  with  on the one hand  EP Equity Investment  an entity controlled by Mr. Daniel Křetínský  Fimalac and Attestor and  on the other hand  creditors economically holding 75% of the TLB  major commercial banking groups and certain of the aforementioned creditors economically holding 92% of the RCF  as well as holders of the HY Quatrim Bonds representing 58% of these bonds. On 25 October 2023  the Paris Commercial Court opened accelerated safeguard proceedings in respect of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries (Casino Finance  DCF  CPF  Quatrim  Ségisor and Monoprix) for an period of 2 months  renewed for a further 2 months. Casino's Accelerated Safeguard Plan and those of the said subsidiaries incorporate the restructuring terms agreed in the Lock-up Agreement. Their main objectives are as follows: (i) a share capital increase of 1.2bn euros  (ii) a capital conversion of 3.5bn euros excluding Perpetual Claims  (iii) the refinancing of 2.6bn euros of debt and (iv) the maintenance of operational financing of 1.2 billion euros.Consolidated net working capital : As of the date of approval of this Prospectus  and prior to the implementation of the Accelerated Safeguard Plan for its benefit (and for the benefit of certain of its subsidiaries)  the Company does not have sufficient consolidated net working capital to meet its future obligations over the next twelve months. In the absence of the completion of the Financial Restructuring  the Company estimates that approximately 7.4 billion euros will be required to cover its liquidity needs  from 1st April 2024  over the next 12 months (i.e. until the end of March 2025). Measures planned as part of the conciliation and accelerated safeguard proceedings ensure that the Company has sufficient cash to finance its up to the effective completion of the Financial Restructuring  expected at the end of March 2024  allowing the Group to cover its liquidity needs for the 1st quarter of 2024  estimated at around 600 million euros. The completion by the end of March 2024 of the Financial Restructuring will meet the Group's estimated liquidity needs until the end of March 2025  in accordance with the accelerated safeguard plan approved by the Paris Commercial Court on 26 February 2024  and this by taking into account the impact of the disposal of HM/SM assets over the same period under the agreements with Groupement Les Mousquetaires  Auchan Retail and Carrefour. Under these conditions  consolidated net working capital would be sufficient to meet the Company's obligations over the next twelve months from the date of approval of the Prospectus.Governance and restrictions on the transfer of Shares : The completion of the Financial Restructuring of the Group will result in a change of control of the Group to France Retail Holdings S.à.r.l. (an entity ultimately controlled by Mr. Daniel Křetínský) On the date of the Financial Restructuring  Mr. Jean-Charles Naouri will resign from all his functions with immediate effect; as well as all members of Casino Board of Directors  with the exception of Ms Nathalie Andrieux. The overall composition of the Board of Directors will be proposed by the Consortium. It is envisaged that the Company will refer to the AFEP-MEDEF Code recommendations  it being specified that the composition and powers of the audit committee and the Compensation and Appointments Committee will comply with the recommendations of the said Code. The Company will remain listed on Euronext Paris.Expert's report: The Company voluntarily appointed Sorgem Evaluation  located at 11 rue Leroux  75116 Paris  and represented by Mr. Maurice Nussenbaum  as an independent expert  in accordance with article 261-3 of the AMF's general regulations  to give an opinion on the fairness of the terms and conditions of the Company's restructuring from the point of view of current shareholders. The conclusion of this opinion is as follows: ""Under these conditions  we are of the opinion that the financial terms and conditions of the proposed restructuring plan are fair to CASINO's current shareholders"".Use and estimated net amount of proceeds:The funds raised in cash within the framework of the Share Capital Increase Reserved for the Consortium SPV and of the Backstopped Share Capital Increase for an amount of € 1 199 999 999.97 (including issue premium) will be used as follows: (i) up to an amount of 220 million euros for repayment of Group Public Liabilities  (ii) up to an amount of around 260 million euros  to redeem in full (y) the Regera Bonds and (z) other borrowings and financial debt  and to pay accrued and overdue interest and fees in cash (other than those to be converted into equity in connection with the Reserved Share Capital Increases); and (iii) the balance being retained by the Company to meet (x) its financial requirements (including the payment of fees and costs related to the restructuring  in particular  the amount of commissions due to creditors having adhered to the Lock-up Agreement payable on the Effective Restructuring Date and (y) any delay in the redeployment of Casino Group. By way of indication  all the expenses relating to the restructuring (including the expenses relating to the Reserved Capital Increases and the Warrants issuances) are currently estimated at an amount of around 125 million euros  of which 40 million euros had been paid by 31 December 2023.Underwriting agreement with firm commitment: Not applicable.Lock-up Agreement: In accordance with the Lock-up Agreement and subject to certain exceptions  (i) France Retail Holdings undertakes not to sell or transfer the New Shares subscribed for in the Share Capital Increase Reserved for the Consortium SPV for a period of 4 years from the subscription date nor (ii) any share subscribed for in the context of the Backstopped Share Capital Increase by the beneficiaries of the Backstopped Share Capital Increase may not be sold or transferred in any manner whatsoever for a period of 6 months from the subscription date.
