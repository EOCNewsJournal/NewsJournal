37323,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rt.com/business/594135-eu-russian-frozen-assets-ukraine/,EU accelerating plan to send profits from frozen Russian assets to Kiev – FT,The EU is aiming to give Kiev around $3 billion from profits generated by frozen Russian assets amid waning aid from the US  the FT reports Read Full Article at RT.com,A first tranche of over $3 billion could be disbursed in July  the outlet has learnedThe European Commission is pressing ahead with its plan to give Kiev up to €3 billion ($3.2 billion) from profits generated by frozen Russian assets amid waning financial support from the US  the Financial Times reported on Tuesday.Brussels is fast-tracking the decision to seize the interest earned from the assets held at clearinghouse Euroclear  starting from February onwards  the article stated.A first tranche of money could be sent to Kiev as early as July if Brussels can secure the approval of all bloc members  the outlet said  citing EU officials. The proposal is reportedly expected before a summit of EU leaders next week.The West has frozen roughly $300 billion in holdings belonging to the Russian central bank since the start of the Ukraine conflict two years ago. Brussels-based clearing house Euroclear holds around €191 billion ($205 billion) of them and has accrued nearly €4.4 billion in interest over the past year.According to the report  Brussels would disburse between €2 and €3 billion in revenue generated by frozen assets this year  depending on interest rates. EU officials estimate that overall profits derived from Russian funds held by Euroclear could reach €20 billion by 2027  the FT said.The issue of tapping Russian assets has grown in importance since a $60 billion American aid package to Ukraine was blocked by the Republican-led US Congress  prompting Kiev to look for alternative donors to fund its war effort.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen last month suggested using the proceeds to send weapons supplies to Ukraine rather than for reconstruction  as had been initially planned.EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said earlier this month that the bloc could use windfall profits from frozen Russian assets to buy weapons for Ukraine through the European Peace Facility  an off-budget mechanism being used to funnel weapons to Ukraine. According to the FT  bloc members are currently negotiating a €5 billion boost for the fund  as well as options to invest in the Ukrainian defense industry.Meanwhile  a number of Western countries remain divided over expropriating Russia’s frozen assets to aid Ukraine. While the US and UK support the direct seizure of the assets  some EU member states  including France and Germany  have recently warned that the move could negatively affect financial stability and erode trust in the euro’s status as a reserve currency.Moscow has warned that it will respond in kind if the West goes through with threats to confiscate Russian assets that are blocked abroad. The finance ministry warned last month that Western states themselves still have holdings in Russia that could be jeopardized if the frozen funds were tapped.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section,neutral,0.2,0.76,0.04,negative,0.03,0.29,0.68,True,English,"['EU accelerating plan', 'frozen Russian assets', 'profits', 'Kiev', 'FT', 'European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen', 'EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell', '$60 billion American aid package', 'The European Commission', 'European Peace Facility', 'Brussels-based clearing house', 'Ukrainian defense industry', 'EU member states', 'waning financial support', 'Russian central bank', 'Republican-led US Congress', 'EU officials', 'EU leaders', '€5 billion boost', 'Western states', 'Financial Times', 'financial stability', 'first tranche', 'The West', 'past year', 'alternative donors', 'war effort', 'budget mechanism', 'Western countries', 'direct seizure', 'reserve currency', 'business section', 'Russian assets', 'bloc members', 'overall profits', 'windfall profits', 'Russian funds', 'frozen assets', 'finance ministry', 'interest rates', 'weapons supplies', 'Ukraine conflict', 'July', 'outlet', 'plan', 'Kiev', 'Tuesday', 'decision', 'clearinghouse', 'Euroclear', 'February', 'article', 'money', 'approval', 'proposal', 'summit', 'holdings', 'start', 'report', 'revenue', 'FT', 'issue', 'importance', 'proceeds', 'reconstruction', 'options', 'number', 'France', 'Germany', 'move', 'trust', 'status', 'Moscow', 'kind', 'threats', 'stories', 'economy']",2024-03-12,2024-03-13,rt.com

The parliament pledged to introduce a common definition of violations  and the minimum penalties for them.Brussels adopted its 13th package of sanctions against Russia last month ahead of the second anniversary of the beginning of the Ukraine conflict. The new sanctions restrict trade in dual-use goods  as well as technologies and electronic components that could be used by Russia’s military-industrial complex. The previously introduced penalties target a broad range of sectors and include trade embargoes  travel bans  and individual sanctions against Russian businessmen and public officials.Western countries have frozen around $300 billion in assets belonging to the Russian central bank since the start of the Ukraine conflict. Brussels is currently working on ways to seize the interest earned from the assets held at the clearinghouse Euroclear  as a number of countries remain divided over expropriating the frozen assets to aid Ukraine.Moscow has said it will respond in kind if the West goes through with threats to confiscate Russian assets that are blocked abroad.

37326,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/explained-how-west-can-use-russias-frozen-funds-to-support-ukraine-5226994,Explained: How West Can Use Russia's Frozen Funds To Support Ukraine,Western officials are edging toward confiscating some of the $300-350 billion worth of frozen Russian financial assets to help support Ukraine  but how it will be done remains highly complex given it would set a contested precedent.,"There is the risk that Russia could  through court action  try and seize Euroclear cash.Western officials are edging toward confiscating some of the $300-350 billion worth of frozen Russian financial assets to help support Ukraine  but how it will be done remains highly complex given it would set a contested precedent.Here are some of the ideas that have been suggested:ConfiscationSome international policymakers and lawyers say the immobilised Russian reserves can simply be confiscated under a doctrine of international law known as ""countermeasures"". The assets would then be sold or collateralised and the proceeds handed to Ukraine  or to a dedicated reconstruction fund.Others raise concerns  though  that it would go against international norms and open a legal Pandora's box given that it would be something of a precedent and that Russia would challenge the move in the courts.Previous examples of such seizures  such as of Iraqi assets after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait  and of German assets after World War Two  happened after those wars had ended  not while they were still raging - as with Russia's invasion of Ukraine.Even in the United States  leading sovereign debt experts have highlighted that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not authorise an outright confiscation of frozen Russian property in the absence of actual armed conflict between the U.S. and Russia.Siphon Off RecordsThe lion's share of the nearly 210 billion euros ($230 billion) of Russian reserves locked in the EU - essentially bonds and other types of securities in which the Russian central bank had invested - are held in a Brussels-based depository called Euroclear.When those assets reach their final payout days - or ""mature""  in banker speak - they get converted into cash  a transaction that is taxed at a rate of 25% in Belgium.Officials in the EU  as well as in the U.S. and Britain where much smaller amounts are frozen  are therefore proposing ringfencing that type of revenue for Ukraine  estimating it will add up to 15-20 billion euros by 2027.EU leaders could give the thumbs-up to such a move later this month. Some in the bloc are still wary  though  and the European Central Bank has warned that claiming the trapped Russian assets should only be done in tandem with G7 powers. They want to ensure it isn't just the euro that is affected if other countries such as China start repatriating their reserves as a precaution against them being swooped on down the line.Some lawyers also point out that  legally  there is little difference between siphoning off the maturity revenues and grabbing the full $300-350 billion.There is the risk that Russia could  through court action  try and seize Euroclear cash in securities depositories in Hong Kong  Dubai and elsewhere. The worry is that this could drain Euroclear capital and require a huge bailout.There are plans therefore to set aside some of the siphoned-off money as a safety net.Reparation Bonds""Reparation bonds"" have also been suggested as a way of circumventing some of the legal problems. Ukraine would sell securities that pay out if - and only if - it receives reparations from Russia for the damage done by the war.Interest payments could also roll up and only become payable if Kyiv gets compensation.The bondholders would not have a contractual claim on the Kremlin's frozen reserves. But given that Russia is unlikely to pay up willingly  these assets would be the most likely source of cash to pay for damages.Since the reserves are accruing interest  they could be used to pay both the bonds' principal and more regular coupon payments. This would be different from confiscation  because the assets would only be transferred if a legitimate compensation mechanism first ruled that damages were due to Ukraine.Ukraine would have a plausible way to collect on any damages awarded up to the value of the reserves. It could therefore issue reparation bonds up to $300-350 billion. But it would only get anything like this sum if the United States  EU governments and other allies were willing to buy the securities.Syndicated LoanThe bond idea has been fleshed out further by Lee Buchheit  a veteran legal expert in sovereign debt  and Daleep Singh  who has just returned to the White House as deputy national security adviser for international economics.Their view is that Ukraine could pledge its claim for reparations against Russia to a syndicate of its allies in return for a loan. If Moscow refused to pay the damages  the allies could then use Russia's frozen assets to pay off the loan. The justification for doing this is the widely recognised legal principle that  if a creditor controls a debtor's assets  it can set off those assets against an unpaid debt.(Except for the headline  this story has not been edited by NDTV staff and is published from a syndicated feed.)",neutral,0.19,0.78,0.03,negative,0.02,0.23,0.75,True,English,"['Frozen Funds', 'West', 'Russia', 'Ukraine', 'International Emergency Economic Powers Act', 'deputy national security adviser', 'leading sovereign debt experts', 'dedicated reconstruction fund', 'actual armed conflict', 'final payout days', 'European Central Bank', '$300-350 billion worth', 'Siphon Off Records', 'regular coupon payments', 'Russian central bank', 'veteran legal expert', '15-20 billion euros', 'legitimate compensation mechanism', 'Russian financial assets', 'G7 powers', '210 billion euros', 'unpaid debt', 'international policymakers', 'international law', 'international norms', 'international economics', 'off money', 'Russian property', 'legal Pandora', 'legal problems', 'legal principle', 'court action', 'Previous examples', 'United States', 'U.S.', 'other types', 'Brussels-based depository', 'smaller amounts', 'other countries', 'little difference', 'maturity revenues', 'Hong Kong', 'Euroclear capital', 'huge bailout', 'safety net', 'Interest payments', 'likely source', 'bond idea', 'Lee Buchheit', 'Daleep Singh', 'White House', 'NDTV staff', 'syndicated feed', 'Russian assets', 'Russian reserves', 'Reparation Bonds', ""bonds' principal"", 'Iraqi assets', 'German assets', 'frozen assets', 'Euroclear cash', 'Western officials', 'contested precedent', 'World War', 'EU leaders', 'contractual claim', 'frozen reserves', 'plausible way', 'EU governments', 'outright confiscation', 'other allies', 'Syndicated Loan', 'securities depositories', 'risk', 'Ukraine', 'ideas', 'lawyers', 'doctrine', 'countermeasures', 'proceeds', 'Others', 'concerns', 'box', 'something', 'move', 'courts', 'seizures', '1990 invasion', 'Kuwait', 'wars', 'IEEPA', 'absence', 'share', 'banker', 'transaction', 'rate', 'Belgium', 'Britain', 'thumbs', 'bloc', 'tandem', 'China', 'precaution', 'line', 'Dubai', 'worry', 'plans', 'reparations', 'damage', 'Kyiv', 'bondholders', 'Kremlin', 'value', 'sum', 'view', 'return', 'Moscow', 'justification', 'creditor', 'debtor', 'story']",2024-03-12,2024-03-13,ndtv.com

S-3SUPPLEMENTAL DESCRIPTION OF THE SENIOR NOTES The following description of the particular terms of the Senior Notes supplements and in certain instances replaces the description of the general terms and provisions of the Senior Notes under ""Description of the Notes"" in the accompanying prospectus. We will issue the Senior Notes under an Indenture  dated as of November 1  2016  between us and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company  N.A.  as Trustee (the ""Trustee"")  as heretofore supplemented and as to be further supplemented as of the issue date for the Senior Notes. Principal Amount  Maturity  Interest and Payment The Senior Notes will initially be issued in an aggregate principal amount of $450 000 000. We may at any time and from time to time  without consent of the holders of the Senior Notes  issue additional notes having the same ranking  interest rate  maturity and other terms (other than the date of issuance  issue price and  in some circumstances  the initial interest accrual date and initial interest payment date) as the Senior Notes. These additional notes  together with the Senior Notes  will constitute a single series of notes under the Indenture. The Senior Notes will mature and become due and payable  together with any accrued and unpaid interest  on April 1  2034 and will bear interest at the rate of 5.15% per year from March 13  2024 until April 1  2034. The Senior Notes are not subject to any sinking fund provision. Interest on each Senior Note will be payable semi-annually in arrears on each April 1 and October 1 (the ""Interest Payment Date"") and at redemption  if any  or maturity. The initial Interest Payment Date is October 1  2024. Each payment of interest shall include interest accrued from March 13  2024  or the immediately preceding Interest Payment Date  through the day before the next Interest Payment Date. Interest on the Senior Notes will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. We will pay interest on the Senior Notes (other than interest payable at redemption  if any  or maturity) in immediately available funds to the registered holders of the Senior Notes as of the Regular Record Date (as defined below) for each Interest Payment Date. We will pay the principal amount of the Senior Notes and any premium and interest payable at redemption  if any  or at maturity in immediately available funds delivered to the Trustee  and the Trustee will forward such funds to the applicable depositary for payments to its participants for subsequent disbursement to the beneficial owners of the Senior Notes. See - Global Clearance and Settlement Procedures. The Senior Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of $2 000 and integral multiples of $1 000 in excess thereof. If any Interest Payment Date  redemption date or the maturity is not a Business Day (as defined below)  we will pay all amounts due on the next succeeding Business Day and no additional interest will be paid. The ""Regular Record Date"" will be the March 15 or September 15 prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date (whether or not a Business Day). S-4""Business Day"" means any day that is not a Saturday or Sunday or any other day on which banking institutions in New York City are authorized or required by law or regulation to close. Optional Redemption We may redeem the Senior Notes at our option at any time upon no more than 60 and not less than 10 days' notice (either by mail or in compliance with the applicable procedures of DTC). Prior to January 1  2034 (three months prior to the maturity date (the ""Par Call Date""))  we may redeem the Senior Notes at our option  in whole or in part  at any time and from time to time  at a redemption price (expressed as a percentage of principal amount and rounded to three decimal places) equal to the greater of: (a) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon discounted to the redemption date (assuming the Senior Notes matured on the Par Call Date) on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate plus 20 basis points less (b) interest accrued to the redemption date; andsemi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate plus 20 basis points less (b) interest accrued to the redemption date; and 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes to be redeemed plus  in each case  accrued and unpaid interest thereon to  but excluding  the redemption date. On or after the Par Call Date  we may redeem the Senior Notes at our option  in whole or in part  at any time and from time to time  at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes to be redeemed  plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to  but excluding  the redemption date. For purposes of these redemption provisions  the following term has the following meaning. ""Treasury Rate"" means  with respect to any redemption date  the yield determined by us in accordance with the following two paragraphs. The Treasury Rate shall be determined by us after 4:15 p.m.  New York City time (or after such time as yields on U.S. government securities are posted daily by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System)  on the third business day preceding the redemption date based upon the yield or yields for the most recent day that appear after such time on such day in the most recent statistical release published by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System designated as ""Selected Interest Rates (Daily)-H.15"" (or any successor designation or publication) (""H.15"") under the caption ""U.S. government securities-Treasury constant maturities-Nominal"" (or any successor caption or heading) (""H.15 TCM""). In determining the Treasury Rate  we shall select  as applicable: the yield for the Treasury constant maturity on H.15 exactly equal to the period from the redemption date to the Par Call Date (the ""Remaining Life""); orif there is no such Treasury constant maturity on H.15 exactly equal to the Remaining Life  the two yields-one yield corresponding to the Treasury constant maturity on H.15 immediately shorter than and one yield corresponding to the Treasury constant maturity on H.15 immediately longer than the Remaining Life-and shall interpolate to the Par Call Date on a straight-line basis (using the actual number of days) using such yields and rounding the result to three decimal places; or S-5if there is no such Treasury constant maturity on H.15 shorter than or longer than the Remaining Life  the yield for the single Treasury constant maturity on H.15 closest to the Remaining Life. For purposes of this clause  the applicable Treasury constant maturity or maturities on H.15 shall be deemed to have a maturity date equal to the relevant number of months or years  as applicable  of such Treasury constant maturity from the redemption date. If on the third business day preceding the redemption date H.15 TCM is no longer published  we shall calculate the Treasury Rate based on the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity at 11:00 a.m.  New York City time  on the second business day preceding such redemption date of the United States Treasury security maturing on  or with a maturity that is closest to the Par Call Date  as applicable. If there is no United States Treasury security maturing on the Par Call Date  but there are two or more United States Treasury securities with a maturity date equally distant from the Par Call Date  one with a maturity date preceding the Par Call Date and one with a maturity date following the Par Call Date  we shall select the United States Treasury security with a maturity date preceding the Par Call Date. If there are two or more United States Treasury securities maturing on the Par Call Date  or two or more United States Treasury securities meeting the criteria of the preceding sentence  we shall select from among these two or more United States Treasury securities the United States Treasury security that is trading closest to par based upon the average of the bid and asked prices for such United States Treasury securities at 11:00 a.m.  New York City time. In determining the Treasury Rate in accordance with the terms of this paragraph  the semi-annual yield to maturity of the applicable United States Treasury security shall be based upon the average of the bid and asked prices (expressed as a percentage of principal amount) at 11:00 a.m.  New York City time  of such United States Treasury security  and rounded to three decimal places. Our actions and determinations in determining the redemption price shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes  absent manifest error. The Trustee shall have no obligation or duty whatsoever to determine  or to verify our calculations of  the redemption price. Covenants Consolidation  Merger or Sale The Company may merge or consolidate with any corporation or sell all or substantially all of its assets as an entirety as long as the successor or purchaser of such assets expressly assumes the payment of principal  and premium  if any  and interest on the Senior Notes. Limitation on Consolidated Priority Debt The Company covenants that so long as any of the Senior Notes are outstanding that it will not permit Consolidated Priority Debt to exceed 10% of Consolidated Tangible Net Assets for a period in excess of five consecutive Business Days. Limitation on Liens The Company covenants that for so long as any of the Senior Notes are outstanding that it will not create or suffer to exist or permit any of its subsidiaries to create or suffer to exist any Secured Debt  unless  at the same time  the Senior Notes that are outstanding are also secured by such Lien on an equal and ratable basis; provided  however  the foregoing does not limit S-6Permitted Liens; and Any other Lien not covered in clause (i) as long as immediately after the creation of such Lien the aggregate principal amount of Secured Debt does not exceed 10% of Consolidated Tangible Net Assets. Covenants Definitions ""Consolidated Priority Debt"" means all Priority Debt of the Company and its subsidiaries determined on a consolidated basis eliminating inter-company items.

Global Clearance and Settlement Procedures Secondary market trading between Clearstream Banking S.A. (""Clearstream"") participants and/or Euroclear Bank SA/NV  as operator of the Euroclear system (""Euroclear"") participants will occur in the ordinary way in accordance with the applicable rules and operating procedures of Clearstream and Euroclear  as applicable. Cross-market transfers between persons holding directly or indirectly through DTC on the one hand  and directly or indirectly through Clearstream participants or Euroclear system participants on the other  will be effected through DTC in accordance with DTC rules on behalf of the relevant European international clearing system by its U.S. depositary; however  such cross-market transactions will require delivery of instructions to the relevant European international clearing system by the counterparty in such system in accordance with its rules and procedures and within its established deadlines (European time). The relevant European international clearing system will  if the transaction meets its settlement requirements  deliver instructions to its U.S. depositary to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving securities in DTC  and making or receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for same-day funds settlement applicable to DTC. Clearstream participants and Euroclear system participants may not deliver instructions directly to their respective U.S. depositaries. Because of time-zone differences  credits of Notes received in Clearstream or the Euroclear system as a result of a transaction with a DTC participant will be made during subsequent securities settlement processing and dated the Business Day following the DTC settlement date. Such credits or any transactions in such Notes settled during such processing will be reported to the relevant Euroclear system participant or Clearstream participant on such Business Day. Cash received in Clearstream or the Euroclear system as a result of sales of the Notes by or through a Clearstream participant or a Euroclear system participant to a DTC participant will be received with value on the DTC settlement date but will be available in the relevant Clearstream or the Euroclear system cash account only as of the Business Day following settlement in DTC. Additional Information For additional important information about the Senior Notes  see ""Description of the Notes"" in the accompanying prospectus  including: (i) additional information about the terms of the Senior Notes  (ii) general information about the Indenture and the Trustee  and (iii) a description of events of default under the Indenture. S-8CERTAIN UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME AND ESTATE TAX CONSEQUENCES TO NON-U.S. HOLDERS The following is a summary of certain United States federal income and estate tax consequences of the purchase  ownership and disposition of the Senior Notes as of the date hereof. This summary deals only with Senior Notes that are held as capital assets by a non-U.S. holder (as defined below) who acquires the Senior Notes upon original issuance at their initial offering price. A ""non-U.S. holder"" means a beneficial owner of the Senior Notes (other than an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes) that is not  for United States federal income tax purposes  any of the following: an individual citizen or resident of the United States;a corporation (or any other entity treated as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes) created or organized in or under the laws of the United States  any state thereof or the District of Columbia;an estate the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its source; ora trust if it (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or more United States persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) has a valid election in effect under applicable United States Treasury regulations to be treated as a United States person. This summary is based upon provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986  as amended (the ""Code"")  and regulations  rulings and judicial decisions as of the date hereof. Those authorities may be changed  perhaps retroactively  so as to result in United States federal income and estate tax consequences different from those summarized below. This summary does not address all aspects of United States federal income and estate taxes and does not deal with foreign  state  local or other tax considerations that may be relevant to non-U.S. holders in light of their personal circumstances. In addition  it does not represent a detailed description of the United States federal income and estate tax consequences applicable to you if you are subject to special treatment under the United States federal income tax laws (including if you are a United States expatriate  ""controlled foreign corporation "" ""passive foreign investment company"" or a partnership or other pass-through entity for United States federal income tax purposes). We cannot assure you that a change in law will not alter significantly the tax considerations that we describe in this summary. If a partnership (or other entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes) holds the Senior Notes  the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. If you are a partner of a partnership holding the Senior Notes  you should consult your tax advisors. It is anticipated  and this discussion assumes  that the Senior Notes will not be issued with more than a de minimis amount of original issue discount for United States federal income tax purposes. If you are considering the purchase of Senior Notes  you should consult your own tax advisors concerning the particular United States federal income and estate tax consequences to you of the purchase  ownership and disposition of the Senior Notes  as well as the consequences to you arising under other United States federal tax laws and the laws of any other taxing jurisdiction.

Amersfoort  The Netherlands - 12 March 2024 Reference is made to the announcement by Envipco Holding N.V. (""Envipco"" or the ""Company"") earlier today regarding a contemplated private placement (the ""Offering""). The Company is pleased to announce that it has raised NOK 300 million in gross proceeds through the Offering  which received strong interest from both existing shareholders and new institutional investors. Pursuant to the Offering  6 000 000 new ordinary shares in the Company (the ""Offer Shares"") will be issued at a price per Offer Share of NOK 50 (the ""Offer Price""). The Company continues to deliver on its European growth strategy and is well positioned to win target share of new market opportunities. Hence  the Company intends to use the net proceeds from the Private Placement to (i) strengthen the Company's footprint to capitalize on new market opportunities  (ii) working capital  (iii) M&A  and (iv) general corporate purposes. The Board has resolved to initiate an up-listing to Oslo Børs (the main list on the Oslo Stock Exchange) and aim to complete such listing within the next 12 months. The Company's shares are listed on Euronext Amsterdam and Euronext Growth Oslo  under the ticker ENVI and ENVIP  respectively. The shares issued and delivered in the Offering will be included and registered in Euroclear Netherlands  but transferred and registered in the Norwegian Central Securities Depository (the ""VPS"") and will not be tradable on Euronext Amsterdam unless subject to a registration process through Euroclear Netherlands  the central security depositary in the Netherlands. The allocated Offer Shares are expected to be settled through a delivery versus payment transaction by delivery of existing and unencumbered shares in the Company that are already listed pursuant to a share lending agreement entered into between Carnegie AS and Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB (publ) (the ""Managers"")  the Company  Mr. Gregory Garvey and Gregory Garvey Family Investments LLC (an entity controlled by Mr. Garvey)  which shares are included and registered in Euroclear Netherlands  the central security depository in the Netherlands  but will be transferred and registered in the VPS. First day of trading in the allocated shares in the Private Placement on Euronext Growth Oslo is expected on 13 March 2024. Further settlement details will be communicated by the Manager.The Board has considered the structure of the contemplated capital raise in light of the equal treatment obligations under the rules on equal treatment of Oslo Rule Book II for companies listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange and the Oslo Stock Exchange's guidelines on the rule of equal treatment  and is of the opinion that the proposed Offering is in compliance with these requirements. By structuring the transaction as a private placement  the Company was in a position to raise capital in an efficient manner  with a lower discount to the current trading price and with significantly lower completion risks compared to a rights issue. In addition  the Offering was subject to marketing through a publicly announced bookbuilding process and a market- based offer price should therefore be achieved. On this basis and based on an assessment of the current equity markets  the Board has considered the Offering to be in the common interest of the Company and its shareholders. On the basis of the above and taking into consideration that the Offer Price represents a limited discount compared to the recent trading price and a premium to the trading price of the Company over the past months  the Board has resolved not to conduct a subsequent offering directed towards shareholders who did not participate in the Offering. Advisers Carnegie AS and Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB (publ) have jointly been retained as Bookrunners and Managers in connection with the Offering. Advokatfirmaet Thommessen AS is acting as the Company's Norwegian legal advisor and Bird & Bird (Netherlands) LLP is acting as the Company's Dutch legal advisor.

They can apply to sell up to 100 000 roubles worth of foreign securities under the scheme. According to the central bank  80% of affected Russian investors have frozen foreign assets up to that threshold.(Reporting by Mark Trevelyan  Elizabeth Piper  Huw Jones and Davide Barbuscia  editing by Ed Osmond)",positive,0.5,0.48,0.01,negative,0.05,0.3,0.65,True,English,"['frozen assets swap scheme', 'Russian stocks', 'Moscow', 'Deputy Prime Minister Ivan Chebeskov', 'Boston-based equity investment firm', 'U.S. companies', 'special ""type-C"" accounts', 'Polaris Capital Management', 'biggest diamond producer', 'up to 100,000 roubles', ""small investors' confidence"", 'international retail investors', 'President Vladimir Putin', 'Investitsionnaya Palata brokerage', 'frozen foreign securities', 'Russian-owned foreign securities', 'government minister', 'good investment', 'Investment Chamber', 'foreign investors', '1.5 trillion roubles', 'foreign buyers', 'Foreign, Commonwealth', 'Russian investors', 'stock market', 'most people', 'finance ministry', 'Development Office', 'desperate attempts', 'Bernard Horn', 'portfolio manager', 'Alexey Sedushkin', 'win-win situation', 'regulatory restrictions', 'central bank', 'Mark Trevelyan', 'Elizabeth Piper', 'Huw Jones', 'Davide Barbuscia', 'Ed Osmond', 'Russian counter-measures', 'Russian proposal', 'foreign assets', 'local broker', '3.5 million Russians', 'Western sanctions', 'Russian shares', 'MOSCOW', 'Reuters', 'scheme', 'foreigners', 'Tuesday', 'plan', 'way', 'start', 'war', 'Ukraine', 'blocking', 'general', 'part', 'money', 'conference', 'mechanism', 'swap', 'Monday', 'March', 'May', 'lots', 'June', 'July', 'funds', 'Britain', 'appointment', 'relevance', 'impact', 'spokesperson', 'effect', 'Alrosa', 'move', 'fog', 'investing', 'Euroclear', 'depositories', 'comment', 'moment', 'CEO', 'result', 'threshold']",2024-03-12,2024-03-13,marketscreener.com

Notwithstanding the Target Market Assessment  distributors should note that: the price of the Subscription Rights and Shares may decline and investors could lose all or part of their investment; the Subscription Rights and Shares offer no guaranteed income and no capital protection; and an investment in the Subscription Rights or Shares is compatible only with investors who do not need a guaranteed income or capital protection  who (either alone or in conjunction with an appropriate financial or other adviser) are capable of evaluating the merits and risks of such an investment and who have sufficient resources to be able to bear any losses that may result therefrom.

ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES The Company is a public limited company incorporated under the laws of Sweden. As a result  the rights of holders of the Shares will be governed by Swedish law and the Company's articles of association (the ""Articles of Association""). The rights of shareholders under Swedish law may differ from the rights of shareholders of companies incorporated in other jurisdictions. The members of the Company's board of directors (the ""Board Members"" and the ""Board of Directors""  respectively) and the members of the senior management of the Company (the ""Management"") are not residents of the United States. Virtually all of the Company's assets and the assets of the Board Members and members of Management are located outside the United States. As a result  it may be impossible or difficult for investors in the United States to effect service of process upon the Company  the Board Members and members of Management in the United States or to enforce against the Company or those persons judgments obtained in U.S. courts  whether predicated upon civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws or other laws of the United States. The United States and Sweden do not currently have a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgements (other than arbitral awards) in civil and commercial matters. Uncertainty exists as to whether courts in Sweden will enforce judgments obtained in other jurisdictions  including the United States  against the Company or its Board Members or members of Management under the securities laws of those jurisdictions or entertain actions in Sweden against the Company or the Board Members or members of Management under the securities laws of other jurisdictions. In addition  awards of punitive damages in actions brought in the United States or elsewhere may not be enforceable in Sweden. Similar restrictions may apply in other jurisdictions.

Furthermore  in view of the forthcoming change of control  the Group is not publishing a new 2024 outlook. The Consortium's business plan Consortium was communicated to the market on 21 December 2023 and appended to the Accelerated Safeguard Plan. It takes into account the Group's refocusing on Monoprix  Franprix  convenience stores and Cdiscount  and aims to improve the Group's profitability through: (i) adopting a policy of permanent low prices  improving the customer experience and service quality  increasing the visibility and attractiveness of the banners  enriching the assortment and setting up partnerships  increasing the singularity of the banners  boosting growth via franchising and the conversion of directly-operated stores  and accelerating Cdiscount's transition to a marketplace model. In 2024  the Consortium targets a positive EBITDA (after rentals) of 126 million euros  net capital expenditure of -354 million euros and operating cash flow before disposals of -655 million  taking into account the normalization of WCR. In the medium term  the Consortium's business plan shows a gradual improvement in the Group's profitability  driven by the implementation of the above-mentioned operating levers and the implementation of an investment plan of almost -1.6 billion euros over the plan's duration  notably with a view to renovating the store base. By the end of the plan in 2028  EBITDA adjusted (after rentals) should improve significantly to 920 million euros  while other operating items and expenses should stabilize at around -50 million euros. As a result  the Consortium forecasts operating cash flow before disposals of 443 million euros  higher than the annual interest expense of around -230 million euros. Finally  net financial debt at the end of this plan would amount to 1 960 million euros  representing a financial leverage of 2.1x.2.3 - What are the issuer's specific risks?An investment in the Company's securities involves numerous risks and uncertainties related to the Group's activities that could result in a partial or total loss of the investment for investors. The main risks  which the Group considers to be the most significant in terms of their potential impact and probability of occurrence  are as follows: Competitive intensity (very significant risk) : The Group operates in highly competitive markets  particularly in France. In e-commerce  the Group  and in particular Cdiscount  faces competition from international players  notably American. Competition is generally focused on outlet location  product quality  service  price (exacerbated by the inflationary context)  product diversity  brand reputation and store condition. In addition  the Group's ability to adapt its business models to customer expectations is a major challenge. Business disruption/interruption (very significant risk) : Risk of business disruption/interruption within the Group  this encompasses the risks of supply disruption  inaccessibility of sites  and destruction/damage to buildings. Supply chain’s efficiency and smooth running are essential. Changes in the Group's logistical structures may lead to an interruption of operations  store shortages and disruption to inventory management. Catastrophic events and other types of events could have a negative effect on the Group's business. The Paris Olympic and Paralympic Games (JOP) are likely to disrupt store operations in the Île-de-France region and at regional competition venues. Franchising risks (very significant risk) : Operating stores under franchise has been one of the Group's development strategies. In France  by the end of 2023  79% of our stores will be operated under franchise or lease management  and in particular 90% of the Casino proximity network. Excluding HM/SM  83% of the Group's store base is operated under franchise or lease management. The Group aims to accelerate its expansion in the convenience sector by 2024  relying primarily on franchising. In view of the sale of the hypermarkets and supermarkets division and the franchise development plan  the proportion of stores operated under franchise or lease management is set to rise to 90% over the next few years. This form of development has the advantage of significantly reducing the investments required to develop the store network  since these are largely borne by the franchisees. However  it also presents risks for the franchisor  the main ones being: (i) image  (ii) poorly controlled development  (iii) financial  (iv) legal and (v) competitive and administrative risks. Risks relating to information systems and cybercrime (very significant risk) : The Group operates a large network of information systems that are essential to the performance and management of its activities. The development  implementation and continuous  uninterrupted operation of these information systems are an important element in the ability to deliver products and services to customers for all the Group's banners  in particular for Cdiscount's operations  as well as for the digital advertising and data center businesses  RelevanC and ScaleMax. These risks also affect stores and warehouses  via critical information systems. International tensions in Eastern Europe and the Middle East  as well as the organization of the Olympic Games in France in 2024  could lead to an upsurge in cyber-attacks on French companies. Risks linked to the economic context (very significant risk) : The Group's business  and in particular its sales  operating income and cash flow generated  are strongly correlated with consumer spending. This spending is affected by economic cycles. In particular  inflation could continue to have an impact on purchasing power  consumption patterns and consumer spending. Current international tensions could continue to drive up the cost of raw materials. Latin American economies have historically been subject to sharp variations in their level of activity. In addition  the Group could be adversely affected by exchange rate movements (rise in the dollar against the euro). What's more  the Group's activities will be mainly concentrated in France following completion of the plan to sell off its South American entities  which makes it vulnerable to France's specific economic context. In France  in Q3 2023  (i) the unemployment rate will rise again  and (ii) INSEE has measured a downward trend in household purchasing power. Liquidity (very significant risk) : In the absence of completion of the Financial Restructuring  the Company would not be in a position to meet its future obligations over the next twelve months  and its ability to continue as a going concern would therefore be compromised. Such situation could lead to the opening of receivership or compulsory winding-up proceedings  which could lead to the sale of all or part of the Company's assets  and could place (i) shareholders in the position of losing their entire investment in the Company  and (ii) creditors in the situation of reduced prospects of recovering their receivables. At 31 December 2023  the Group's cash position amounted to 1 051 million euros. Increased by the cash generated by the disposal of the Éxito group in January 2024 for a net amount of 357 million euros  the Group covers its liquidity needs for the 1st quarter of 2024  estimated at 600 million euros. Risks relating to compliance with laws and regulations (very significant risk) : With a particularly extensive supply chain  and given the nature of the Group's activities and its international presence  the Group is exposed to the risk of legal action  particularly in respect of the Sapin II law pertaining to the fight against corruption  the law relating to the duty of care of parent companies and principals and non-compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (RGPD). The protection of data concerning the Group's customers and employees is also a major issue to which the Group pays particular attention. Exposure to this risk is heightened by the development of e-commerce activities and the increasing digitization of data media. Both in France and abroad  the Group is subject to all legislation and regulations governing the operation of establishments open to the public.Section 3 - Key information on securities3.1 - What are

According to the indicative timetable  the New Shares issued in connection with the Reserved Share Capital Increases will be admitted to trading on this market as from 27 March 2024. They will be immediately assimilated to the existing shares already traded on Euronext Paris and will be tradable  as from this date  on the same trading line under ISIN Code FR0000125585. The Warrants #1 and the Warrants #3 will be tradable on Euronext Paris from their Issue Date respectively  under ISIN Codes FR001400OJ72 and ISIN FR001400OJ98 respectively. No application for admission to trading on another regulated market has been or will be made. The Warrants #2 and the Warrants Additional Shares will not be the subject of an application for admission to trading on any regulated or unregulated market. They will be freely tradable and will be the subject of a request for admission to trading by Euroclear France  which will ensure their clearing between account holders-custodians. The Warrants constitute securities giving access to the share capital within the meaning of articles L. 228-91 et seq. of the French Commercial Code. No application has been made or is contemplated to be made by the Company for them to be admitted to trading on another market (regulated or not). The New Shares resulting from the exercise of the Warrants will be subject to periodic requests for admission to trading on Euronext Paris and will be tradable on the same trading line as the existing Shares.3.3 - Are securities covered by a guarantee?The Reserved Share Capital Increases are not secured by a bank syndicate or underwriting agreement. They are subscribed under the Accelerated Safeguard Plan. Similarly  the issue of Warrants is underwritten by application of the Accelerated Safeguard Plan. These commitments do not constitute a performance guarantee (garantie de bonne fin) within the meaning of Article L. 225-145 of the French Commercial Code.3.4 - What are the main risks specific to securities?The main risk factors relating to the New Shares (including those issued upon exercise of the Warrants) and the Warrants are set out below. The Group has assessed the significance of the specific risks to which it believes it is exposed on the basis of the likelihood of their materialization and the estimated magnitude of their negative impact after taking into account the action plans in place. The most significant risk factors according to the above assessment are indicated first and marked with an asterisk. Existing Casino shareholders will suffer significant dilution of their interest in the Company's share capital as a result of the completion of the Issuances and the exercise of the Warrants *: The implementation of the Issuances should be completed by the end of the first quarter 2024 and the exercise of the Warrants contemplated under the financial restructuring plan will result in significant dilution for existing Casino shareholders. As an indication  a shareholder holding 1% of the Company's share capital would see his shareholding decrease (on a diluted basis)  post completion of the Reserved Share Capital Increases  to 0.003% of the Company's share capital and 0.003% post exercise of all the Warrants. In view of the very large number of Shares and Warrants issued in connection with the Issuances  sales of a significant number of Shares or Warrants could occur rapidly from the date of completion of the Issuances  or such sales could be anticipated by the market  which could have an unfavorable impact on the market price of the Shares and/or the market price of the Warrants *: The completion of the Issuances and the exercise of the Warrants would lead to the issuance of a significant number of Shares and to a significant change in the shareholder structure. Sales of a significant number of the Shares or Warrants could occur rapidly from the completion date of the Issuances  or such sales could be anticipated by the market given the absence of a lock-up commitment for some beneficiaries of the Reserved Share Capital Increases  which could have an unfavorable impact on the market price of the Share and/or of each category of Warrants. It is therefore highly likely that the post-Warrants issue and exercise share price will be close to the issue price of the Reserved Share Capital Increases and the exercise of the Warrants  thus having a lasting impact on the company's share price and the group’s capital market financing. Volatility and liquidity of the Shares and Warrants may fluctuate significantly *: Stock markets have experienced significant fluctuations unrelated to the results of the concerned companies  which could increase the volatility of the Shares  cumulated to their low unit value prior completion of the Reverse Share Split. The liquidity of the market for the Shares could be reduced as a result of the capital ownership structure on completion of the Financial Restructuring transactions. No assurance can be given that a market will develop for the Warrants #1 and the Warrants #3 on Euronext Paris and  if it does develop  it may offer only limited liquidity and be subject to high volatility. Holders of the Warrants #1 and the Warrants #3  as the case may be  who do not wish to exercise them may not be able to sell them on the market. The market price of the said Warrants #1 and the Warrants #3 will depend in particular on the market price of the Shares and  in the event of a decline in the market price of the Shares  the value of these Warrants could decrease. In addition  trades between institutional investors involving large quantities are generally executed off-market. Consequently  not all investors may have access to this type of transaction and  in particular  to their pricing conditions. The market price of the Shares could fluctuate and fall below the subscription price of the New Shares issued upon exercise of the Warrants  and if this fall were to occur after the exercise of the Warrants by their holders  the latter would suffer a loss in the event of immediate sale of the said New Shares* : No assurance can be given that  during the Exercise Period of the Warrants  the market price of the shares will be higher than or equal to the exercise price of the Warrants nor  consequently  that the Warrant Holders will be able to acquire additional shares in the Company's share capital at an attractive price. If the share price were to fall after the exercise of the Warrants by their holders  the latter would suffer a loss in the event of immediate sale of the Shares received. Thus  no assurance can be given that  subsequent to the exercise of the Warrants  investors will be able to sell their Shares at a price equal to or greater than the exercise price of the Warrants. Risk of lapsing and loss of value of the Warrants : Warrants that have not been exercised by the expiry date of their Exercise Period will lapse and lose all value and rights attached thereto. The terms and conditions of each category of Warrants may be modified and such modifications would be binding on all their respective holders : The terms and conditions of each category of Warrants may be modified  subject to the authorization of a special meeting of the holders of each of the categories of warrants concerned  deciding  in accordance with current regulations  by a two-thirds majority of the votes of the holders present or represented at said meeting. Any amendment so approved will be binding upon all Holders of Warrants #1  Holders of Warrants #2  Holders of Warrants #3 or Holders of Warrants Additional Shares  as the case may be. The terms and conditions of each category of Warrants are based on the laws and regulations in force at the date of this document. Legislative or regulatory developments could have the effect of modifying the terms and conditions of each category of Warrants  which could have an impact on their value. No assurance can be given as to the impact of such potential changes after the date of this document. The holders of each category of Warrants benefit from limited anti-dilution protection : The exercise ratio of each category of Warrants will be adjusted in the only cases provided for by their terms and conditions of said Warrants and in accordance with the provisions of the French Commercial Code. Accordingly  the exercise ratio of each category of Warrants will not necessarily be adjusted in all cases where an event relating to the Company or any other event is likely to affect the value of the Shares or  more generally  to have a dilutive impact. Events for which no adjustment is foreseen could have a negative impact on the value of the Shares and  consequently  on that of the Warrants.Section 4 - Key information on admission to trading on a regulated market for securities4.1 - Under what conditions and according to what timetable can I invest in this security?Conditions to the transaction: The approval of the Accelerated Safeguard Plan by the class of shareholders of the Company  meeting as a class of affected parties on 11 January 2024  entailed approval by the class of shareholders of all the resolutions included in the appendix to the Accelerated Safeguard Plan  delegating powers to the Company's Board of Directors  notably for the purpose of carrying out the Issuances.Reserved Share Capital Increases: The Reserved Share Capital Increases will be carried out through the waiver of the shareholders’ preferential subscription rights in favor of beneficiaries mentioned in section 3.1.1 of this Summary.

The impact of the restructuring on control of the Company is more fully described in section 2 of the URD. A shareholders’ agreement would be entered into between the shareholders of France Retail Holdings. On 9 January 2024  the AMF granted an exemption from the obligation for the members of the Consortium acting in concert and their investment vehicle (France Retail Holdings) to file a draft public offer for Casino shares.Estimated expenses related to the Reserved Share Capital Increase and the Warrants issues: For information purposes  all expenses related to the restructuring (including expenses related to the Reserved Share Capital Increases and the Warrants issues) are currently estimated at an amount of approximately 125 million euros  of which 40 million euros were paid at 31 December 2023. In addition  the Unsecured Creditors and the Perpetual Creditors having acceded to the Lock-up Agreement at the latest on the Last Accession Date will benefit from a specific support fee on the Effective Restructuring Date (for a total amount of approximately 6 8 million euros). It is specified that the expenses relating to the Reserved Share Capital Increases and the issuance of the Warrants will be financed exclusively from the Group's available cash and the setting up of new financing lines.Expenses billed to the investor by the Company: Not applicable4.2 - Why is this prospectus being prepared?This Prospectus has been prepared in connection with the admission of the New Shares and Warrants #1 and Warrants #3 to trading on Euronext Paris. The information contained in this Prospectus allows to restore  in all material respects and as far as necessary  equal access between the various shareholders and investors to information relating to the Company. It is reminded that the Issuances will result from the implementation of the Accelerated Safeguard Plan. With the exception of the Reverse Share Split and Share Capital Reduction No. 2  all transactions provided for in the Accelerated Safeguard Plan  form an indissociable whole  so that if one of the transactions were not to be carried out  none of them would be implemented. The Accelerated Safeguard Plan is expected to be implemented by 30 April 2024 at the latest  or such other date as may be determined in accordance with the Accelerated Safeguard Plan and the Lock-up Agreement.Reason for Issuances and use of proceeds: Context of Issuances: Fiscal year 2022 and the first semester 2023 were characterized by high inflation in food prices  leading the Group to face a decline in sales in its HM/SM due to losses in market share as a result of a pricing policy superior to that of its competitors. Furthermore  operating cash flow generation in France before implementation of the asset disposal plan for 2022 was negative at 524m euros. In this context  on 5 October 2023  the Group entered into a lock-up agreement (the ""Lock-up Agreement"") relating to its Financial Restructuring  with  on the one hand  EP Equity Investment  an entity controlled by Mr. Daniel Křetínský  Fimalac and Attestor and  on the other hand  creditors economically holding 75% of the TLB  major commercial banking groups and certain of the aforementioned creditors economically holding 92% of the RCF  as well as holders of the HY Quatrim Bonds representing 58% of these bonds. On 25 October 2023  the Paris Commercial Court opened accelerated safeguard proceedings in respect of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries (Casino Finance  DCF  CPF  Quatrim  Ségisor and Monoprix) for an period of 2 months  renewed for a further 2 months. Casino's Accelerated Safeguard Plan and those of the said subsidiaries incorporate the restructuring terms agreed in the Lock-up Agreement. Their main objectives are as follows: (i) a share capital increase of 1.2bn euros  (ii) a capital conversion of 3.5bn euros excluding Perpetual Claims  (iii) the refinancing of 2.6bn euros of debt and (iv) the maintenance of operational financing of 1.2 billion euros.Consolidated net working capital : As of the date of approval of this Prospectus  and prior to the implementation of the Accelerated Safeguard Plan for its benefit (and for the benefit of certain of its subsidiaries)  the Company does not have sufficient consolidated net working capital to meet its future obligations over the next twelve months. In the absence of the completion of the Financial Restructuring  the Company estimates that approximately 7.4 billion euros will be required to cover its liquidity needs  from 1st April 2024  over the next 12 months (i.e. until the end of March 2025). Measures planned as part of the conciliation and accelerated safeguard proceedings ensure that the Company has sufficient cash to finance its up to the effective completion of the Financial Restructuring  expected at the end of March 2024  allowing the Group to cover its liquidity needs for the 1st quarter of 2024  estimated at around 600 million euros. The completion by the end of March 2024 of the Financial Restructuring will meet the Group's estimated liquidity needs until the end of March 2025  in accordance with the accelerated safeguard plan approved by the Paris Commercial Court on 26 February 2024  and this by taking into account the impact of the disposal of HM/SM assets over the same period under the agreements with Groupement Les Mousquetaires  Auchan Retail and Carrefour. Under these conditions  consolidated net working capital would be sufficient to meet the Company's obligations over the next twelve months from the date of approval of the Prospectus.Governance and restrictions on the transfer of Shares : The completion of the Financial Restructuring of the Group will result in a change of control of the Group to France Retail Holdings S.à.r.l. (an entity ultimately controlled by Mr. Daniel Křetínský) On the date of the Financial Restructuring  Mr. Jean-Charles Naouri will resign from all his functions with immediate effect; as well as all members of Casino Board of Directors  with the exception of Ms Nathalie Andrieux. The overall composition of the Board of Directors will be proposed by the Consortium. It is envisaged that the Company will refer to the AFEP-MEDEF Code recommendations  it being specified that the composition and powers of the audit committee and the Compensation and Appointments Committee will comply with the recommendations of the said Code. The Company will remain listed on Euronext Paris.Expert's report: The Company voluntarily appointed Sorgem Evaluation  located at 11 rue Leroux  75116 Paris  and represented by Mr. Maurice Nussenbaum  as an independent expert  in accordance with article 261-3 of the AMF's general regulations  to give an opinion on the fairness of the terms and conditions of the Company's restructuring from the point of view of current shareholders.

Furthermore  in view of the forthcoming change of control  the Group is not publishing a new 2024 outlook. The Consortium's business plan Consortium was communicated to the market on 21 December 2023 and appended to the Accelerated Safeguard Plan. It takes into account the Group's refocusing on Monoprix  Franprix  convenience stores and Cdiscount  and aims to improve the Group's profitability through: (i) adopting a policy of permanent low prices  improving the customer experience and service quality  increasing the visibility and attractiveness of the banners  enriching the assortment and setting up partnerships  increasing the singularity of the banners  boosting growth via franchising and the conversion of directly-operated stores  and accelerating Cdiscount's transition to a marketplace model. In 2024  the Consortium targets a positive EBITDA (after rentals) of 126 million euros  net capital expenditure of -354 million euros and operating cash flow before disposals of -655 million  taking into account the normalization of WCR. In the medium term  the Consortium's business plan shows a gradual improvement in the Group's profitability  driven by the implementation of the above-mentioned operating levers and the implementation of an investment plan of almost -1.6 billion euros over the plan's duration  notably with a view to renovating the store base. By the end of the plan in 2028  EBITDA adjusted (after rentals) should improve significantly to 920 million euros  while other operating items and expenses should stabilize at around -50 million euros. As a result  the Consortium forecasts operating cash flow before disposals of 443 million euros  higher than the annual interest expense of around -230 million euros. Finally  net financial debt at the end of this plan would amount to 1 960 million euros  representing a financial leverage of 2.1x.2.3 - What are the issuer's specific risks?An investment in the Company's securities involves numerous risks and uncertainties related to the Group's activities that could result in a partial or total loss of the investment for investors. The main risks  which the Group considers to be the most significant in terms of their potential impact and probability of occurrence  are as follows: Competitive intensity (very significant risk) : The Group operates in highly competitive markets  particularly in France. In e-commerce  the Group  and in particular Cdiscount  faces competition from international players  notably American. Competition is generally focused on outlet location  product quality  service  price (exacerbated by the inflationary context)  product diversity  brand reputation and store condition. In addition  the Group's ability to adapt its business models to customer expectations is a major challenge. Business disruption/interruption (very significant risk) : Risk of business disruption/interruption within the Group  this encompasses the risks of supply disruption  inaccessibility of sites  and destruction/damage to buildings. Supply chain’s efficiency and smooth running are essential. Changes in the Group's logistical structures may lead to an interruption of operations  store shortages and disruption to inventory management. Catastrophic events and other types of events could have a negative effect on the Group's business. The Paris Olympic and Paralympic Games (JOP) are likely to disrupt store operations in the Île-de-France region and at regional competition venues. Franchising risks (very significant risk) : Operating stores under franchise has been one of the Group's development strategies. In France  by the end of 2023  79% of our stores will be operated under franchise or lease management  and in particular 90% of the Casino proximity network. Excluding HM/SM  83% of the Group's store base is operated under franchise or lease management. The Group aims to accelerate its expansion in the convenience sector by 2024  relying primarily on franchising. In view of the sale of the hypermarkets and supermarkets division and the franchise development plan  the proportion of stores operated under franchise or lease management is set to rise to 90% over the next few years. This form of development has the advantage of significantly reducing the investments required to develop the store network  since these are largely borne by the franchisees. However  it also presents risks for the franchisor  the main ones being: (i) image  (ii) poorly controlled development  (iii) financial  (iv) legal and (v) competitive and administrative risks. Risks relating to information systems and cybercrime (very significant risk) : The Group operates a large network of information systems that are essential to the performance and management of its activities. The development  implementation and continuous  uninterrupted operation of these information systems are an important element in the ability to deliver products and services to customers for all the Group's banners  in particular for Cdiscount's operations  as well as for the digital advertising and data center businesses  RelevanC and ScaleMax. These risks also affect stores and warehouses  via critical information systems. International tensions in Eastern Europe and the Middle East  as well as the organization of the Olympic Games in France in 2024  could lead to an upsurge in cyber-attacks on French companies. Risks linked to the economic context (very significant risk) : The Group's business  and in particular its sales  operating income and cash flow generated  are strongly correlated with consumer spending. This spending is affected by economic cycles. In particular  inflation could continue to have an impact on purchasing power  consumption patterns and consumer spending. Current international tensions could continue to drive up the cost of raw materials. Latin American economies have historically been subject to sharp variations in their level of activity. In addition  the Group could be adversely affected by exchange rate movements (rise in the dollar against the euro). What's more  the Group's activities will be mainly concentrated in France following completion of the plan to sell off its South American entities  which makes it vulnerable to France's specific economic context. In France  in Q3 2023  (i) the unemployment rate will rise again  and (ii) INSEE has measured a downward trend in household purchasing power. Liquidity (very significant risk) : In the absence of completion of the Financial Restructuring  the Company would not be in a position to meet its future obligations over the next twelve months  and its ability to continue as a going concern would therefore be compromised. Such situation could lead to the opening of receivership or compulsory winding-up proceedings  which could lead to the sale of all or part of the Company's assets  and could place (i) shareholders in the position of losing their entire investment in the Company  and (ii) creditors in the situation of reduced prospects of recovering their receivables. At 31 December 2023  the Group's cash position amounted to 1 051 million euros. Increased by the cash generated by the disposal of the Éxito group in January 2024 for a net amount of 357 million euros  the Group covers its liquidity needs for the 1st quarter of 2024  estimated at 600 million euros. Risks relating to compliance with laws and regulations (very significant risk) : With a particularly extensive supply chain  and given the nature of the Group's activities and its international presence  the Group is exposed to the risk of legal action  particularly in respect of the Sapin II law pertaining to the fight against corruption  the law relating to the duty of care of parent companies and principals and non-compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (RGPD). The protection of data concerning the Group's customers and employees is also a major issue to which the Group pays particular attention. Exposure to this risk is heightened by the development of e-commerce activities and the increasing digitization of data media. Both in France and abroad  the Group is subject to all legislation and regulations governing the operation of establishments open to the public.Section 3 - Key information on securities3.1 - What are

One Warrants #2 will give right to subscribe for one New Share (subject to the adjustments described in the terms and conditions of said Warrants #2)  at the exercise price of 0.0000922 euro  fully paid up in cash  it being specified that if the exercise price of the Warrants #2 is less than the nominal value of a share  the difference between the exercise price and the nominal value of the share will be paid up by the Company by deduction from an available reserve or premium account of the Company (and in priority from the account set up specifically for this purpose). The Warrants #2 will be exercisable for a period of 3 months following the Effective Restructuring Date. The exercise of all Warrant #3 will give right to subscribe for a maximum of 1 082 917 221 New Shares (subject to the adjustments described in the terms and conditions of said Warrant #3)  at an exercise price of 0.1688 euro  paid up in full in cash. The Warrant #3 will be exercisable for a period of 3 years from the 25th month following the Effective Restructuring Date.

According to the indicative timetable  the New Shares issued in connection with the Reserved Share Capital Increases will be admitted to trading on this market as from 27 March 2024. They will be immediately assimilated to the existing shares already traded on Euronext Paris and will be tradable  as from this date  on the same trading line under ISIN Code FR0000125585. The Warrants #1 and the Warrants #3 will be tradable on Euronext Paris from their Issue Date respectively  under ISIN Codes FR001400OJ72 and ISIN FR001400OJ98 respectively. No application for admission to trading on another regulated market has been or will be made. The Warrants #2 and the Warrants Additional Shares will not be the subject of an application for admission to trading on any regulated or unregulated market. They will be freely tradable and will be the subject of a request for admission to trading by Euroclear France  which will ensure their clearing between account holders-custodians. The Warrants constitute securities giving access to the share capital within the meaning of articles L. 228-91 et seq. of the French Commercial Code. No application has been made or is contemplated to be made by the Company for them to be admitted to trading on another market (regulated or not). The New Shares resulting from the exercise of the Warrants will be subject to periodic requests for admission to trading on Euronext Paris and will be tradable on the same trading line as the existing Shares.3.3 - Are securities covered by a guarantee?The Reserved Share Capital Increases are not secured by a bank syndicate or underwriting agreement. They are subscribed under the Accelerated Safeguard Plan. Similarly  the issue of Warrants is underwritten by application of the Accelerated Safeguard Plan. These commitments do not constitute a performance guarantee (garantie de bonne fin) within the meaning of Article L. 225-145 of the French Commercial Code.3.4 - What are the main risks specific to securities?The main risk factors relating to the New Shares (including those issued upon exercise of the Warrants) and the Warrants are set out below. The Group has assessed the significance of the specific risks to which it believes it is exposed on the basis of the likelihood of their materialization and the estimated magnitude of their negative impact after taking into account the action plans in place. The most significant risk factors according to the above assessment are indicated first and marked with an asterisk. Existing Casino shareholders will suffer significant dilution of their interest in the Company's share capital as a result of the completion of the Issuances and the exercise of the Warrants *: The implementation of the Issuances should be completed by the end of the first quarter 2024 and the exercise of the Warrants contemplated under the financial restructuring plan will result in significant dilution for existing Casino shareholders. As an indication  a shareholder holding 1% of the Company's share capital would see his shareholding decrease (on a diluted basis)  post completion of the Reserved Share Capital Increases  to 0.003% of the Company's share capital and 0.003% post exercise of all the Warrants. In view of the very large number of Shares and Warrants issued in connection with the Issuances  sales of a significant number of Shares or Warrants could occur rapidly from the date of completion of the Issuances  or such sales could be anticipated by the market  which could have an unfavorable impact on the market price of the Shares and/or the market price of the Warrants *: The completion of the Issuances and the exercise of the Warrants would lead to the issuance of a significant number of Shares and to a significant change in the shareholder structure. Sales of a significant number of the Shares or Warrants could occur rapidly from the completion date of the Issuances  or such sales could be anticipated by the market given the absence of a lock-up commitment for some beneficiaries of the Reserved Share Capital Increases  which could have an unfavorable impact on the market price of the Share and/or of each category of Warrants. It is therefore highly likely that the post-Warrants issue and exercise share price will be close to the issue price of the Reserved Share Capital Increases and the exercise of the Warrants  thus having a lasting impact on the company's share price and the group’s capital market financing. Volatility and liquidity of the Shares and Warrants may fluctuate significantly *: Stock markets have experienced significant fluctuations unrelated to the results of the concerned companies  which could increase the volatility of the Shares  cumulated to their low unit value prior completion of the Reverse Share Split. The liquidity of the market for the Shares could be reduced as a result of the capital ownership structure on completion of the Financial Restructuring transactions. No assurance can be given that a market will develop for the Warrants #1 and the Warrants #3 on Euronext Paris and  if it does develop  it may offer only limited liquidity and be subject to high volatility. Holders of the Warrants #1 and the Warrants #3  as the case may be  who do not wish to exercise them may not be able to sell them on the market. The market price of the said Warrants #1 and the Warrants #3 will depend in particular on the market price of the Shares and  in the event of a decline in the market price of the Shares  the value of these Warrants could decrease. In addition  trades between institutional investors involving large quantities are generally executed off-market. Consequently  not all investors may have access to this type of transaction and  in particular  to their pricing conditions. The market price of the Shares could fluctuate and fall below the subscription price of the New Shares issued upon exercise of the Warrants  and if this fall were to occur after the exercise of the Warrants by their holders  the latter would suffer a loss in the event of immediate sale of the said New Shares* : No assurance can be given that  during the Exercise Period of the Warrants  the market price of the shares will be higher than or equal to the exercise price of the Warrants nor  consequently  that the Warrant Holders will be able to acquire additional shares in the Company's share capital at an attractive price. If the share price were to fall after the exercise of the Warrants by their holders  the latter would suffer a loss in the event of immediate sale of the Shares received. Thus  no assurance can be given that  subsequent to the exercise of the Warrants  investors will be able to sell their Shares at a price equal to or greater than the exercise price of the Warrants. Risk of lapsing and loss of value of the Warrants : Warrants that have not been exercised by the expiry date of their Exercise Period will lapse and lose all value and rights attached thereto. The terms and conditions of each category of Warrants may be modified and such modifications would be binding on all their respective holders : The terms and conditions of each category of Warrants may be modified  subject to the authorization of a special meeting of the holders of each of the categories of warrants concerned  deciding  in accordance with current regulations  by a two-thirds majority of the votes of the holders present or represented at said meeting. Any amendment so approved will be binding upon all Holders of Warrants #1  Holders of Warrants #2  Holders of Warrants #3 or Holders of Warrants Additional Shares  as the case may be. The terms and conditions of each category of Warrants are based on the laws and regulations in force at the date of this document. Legislative or regulatory developments could have the effect of modifying the terms and conditions of each category of Warrants  which could have an impact on their value. No assurance can be given as to the impact of such potential changes after the date of this document. The holders of each category of Warrants benefit from limited anti-dilution protection : The exercise ratio of each category of Warrants will be adjusted in the only cases provided for by their terms and conditions of said Warrants and in accordance with the provisions of the French Commercial Code. Accordingly  the exercise ratio of each category of Warrants will not necessarily be adjusted in all cases where an event relating to the Company or any other event is likely to affect the value of the Shares or  more generally  to have a dilutive impact. Events for which no adjustment is foreseen could have a negative impact on the value of the Shares and  consequently  on that of the Warrants.Section 4 - Key information on admission to trading on a regulated market for securities4.1 - Under what conditions and according to what timetable can I invest in this security?Conditions to the transaction: The approval of the Accelerated Safeguard Plan by the class of shareholders of the Company  meeting as a class of affected parties on 11 January 2024  entailed approval by the class of shareholders of all the resolutions included in the appendix to the Accelerated Safeguard Plan  delegating powers to the Company's Board of Directors  notably for the purpose of carrying out the Issuances.Reserved Share Capital Increases: The Reserved Share Capital Increases will be carried out through the waiver of the shareholders’ preferential subscription rights in favor of beneficiaries mentioned in section 3.1.1 of this Summary.

The impact of the restructuring on control of the Company is more fully described in section 2 of the URD. A shareholders’ agreement would be entered into between the shareholders of France Retail Holdings. On 9 January 2024  the AMF granted an exemption from the obligation for the members of the Consortium acting in concert and their investment vehicle (France Retail Holdings) to file a draft public offer for Casino shares.Estimated expenses related to the Reserved Share Capital Increase and the Warrants issues: For information purposes  all expenses related to the restructuring (including expenses related to the Reserved Share Capital Increases and the Warrants issues) are currently estimated at an amount of approximately 125 million euros  of which 40 million euros were paid at 31 December 2023. In addition  the Unsecured Creditors and the Perpetual Creditors having acceded to the Lock-up Agreement at the latest on the Last Accession Date will benefit from a specific support fee on the Effective Restructuring Date (for a total amount of approximately 6 8 million euros). It is specified that the expenses relating to the Reserved Share Capital Increases and the issuance of the Warrants will be financed exclusively from the Group's available cash and the setting up of new financing lines.Expenses billed to the investor by the Company: Not applicable4.2 - Why is this prospectus being prepared?This Prospectus has been prepared in connection with the admission of the New Shares and Warrants #1 and Warrants #3 to trading on Euronext Paris. The information contained in this Prospectus allows to restore  in all material respects and as far as necessary  equal access between the various shareholders and investors to information relating to the Company. It is reminded that the Issuances will result from the implementation of the Accelerated Safeguard Plan. With the exception of the Reverse Share Split and Share Capital Reduction No. 2  all transactions provided for in the Accelerated Safeguard Plan  form an indissociable whole  so that if one of the transactions were not to be carried out  none of them would be implemented. The Accelerated Safeguard Plan is expected to be implemented by 30 April 2024 at the latest  or such other date as may be determined in accordance with the Accelerated Safeguard Plan and the Lock-up Agreement.Reason for Issuances and use of proceeds: Context of Issuances: Fiscal year 2022 and the first semester 2023 were characterized by high inflation in food prices  leading the Group to face a decline in sales in its HM/SM due to losses in market share as a result of a pricing policy superior to that of its competitors. Furthermore  operating cash flow generation in France before implementation of the asset disposal plan for 2022 was negative at 524m euros. In this context  on 5 October 2023  the Group entered into a lock-up agreement (the ""Lock-up Agreement"") relating to its Financial Restructuring  with  on the one hand  EP Equity Investment  an entity controlled by Mr. Daniel Křetínský  Fimalac and Attestor and  on the other hand  creditors economically holding 75% of the TLB  major commercial banking groups and certain of the aforementioned creditors economically holding 92% of the RCF  as well as holders of the HY Quatrim Bonds representing 58% of these bonds. On 25 October 2023  the Paris Commercial Court opened accelerated safeguard proceedings in respect of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries (Casino Finance  DCF  CPF  Quatrim  Ségisor and Monoprix) for an period of 2 months  renewed for a further 2 months. Casino's Accelerated Safeguard Plan and those of the said subsidiaries incorporate the restructuring terms agreed in the Lock-up Agreement. Their main objectives are as follows: (i) a share capital increase of 1.2bn euros  (ii) a capital conversion of 3.5bn euros excluding Perpetual Claims  (iii) the refinancing of 2.6bn euros of debt and (iv) the maintenance of operational financing of 1.2 billion euros.Consolidated net working capital : As of the date of approval of this Prospectus  and prior to the implementation of the Accelerated Safeguard Plan for its benefit (and for the benefit of certain of its subsidiaries)  the Company does not have sufficient consolidated net working capital to meet its future obligations over the next twelve months. In the absence of the completion of the Financial Restructuring  the Company estimates that approximately 7.4 billion euros will be required to cover its liquidity needs  from 1st April 2024  over the next 12 months (i.e. until the end of March 2025). Measures planned as part of the conciliation and accelerated safeguard proceedings ensure that the Company has sufficient cash to finance its up to the effective completion of the Financial Restructuring  expected at the end of March 2024  allowing the Group to cover its liquidity needs for the 1st quarter of 2024  estimated at around 600 million euros. The completion by the end of March 2024 of the Financial Restructuring will meet the Group's estimated liquidity needs until the end of March 2025  in accordance with the accelerated safeguard plan approved by the Paris Commercial Court on 26 February 2024  and this by taking into account the impact of the disposal of HM/SM assets over the same period under the agreements with Groupement Les Mousquetaires  Auchan Retail and Carrefour. Under these conditions  consolidated net working capital would be sufficient to meet the Company's obligations over the next twelve months from the date of approval of the Prospectus.Governance and restrictions on the transfer of Shares : The completion of the Financial Restructuring of the Group will result in a change of control of the Group to France Retail Holdings S.à.r.l. (an entity ultimately controlled by Mr. Daniel Křetínský) On the date of the Financial Restructuring  Mr. Jean-Charles Naouri will resign from all his functions with immediate effect; as well as all members of Casino Board of Directors  with the exception of Ms Nathalie Andrieux. The overall composition of the Board of Directors will be proposed by the Consortium. It is envisaged that the Company will refer to the AFEP-MEDEF Code recommendations  it being specified that the composition and powers of the audit committee and the Compensation and Appointments Committee will comply with the recommendations of the said Code.

In case of any discrepancies between the Swedish text and the English translation  the Swedish text shall prevail. The board of directors' proposal for a decision on the directed issue of warrants and approval of the subsidiary's transfer pursuant to Chapter 16 section 4 second paragraph of the Companies Act (item 12) Background and motive The board of directors of Acconeer AB (publ)  reg. no. 556872-7654  (the ""Company"") has proposed that the annual general meeting resolves on a warrant-based incentive program for the individuals who are or will be employed by the Company (individuals employed for a fixed time period are excluded) including the CEO of the Company (""Employees"") in accordance with the conditions set out below (""Warrant Program 2024/2028""). The purpose of the proposed program and the reasons for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights are that the board of directors believes that a warrant program that allows the Employees to gain access to the Company's value development promotes participation and accountability and brings increased motivation to promote favourable economic development in the Company. An incentive program is also expected to contribute to the recruitment and retention of competent  motivated and committed employees. In light of the above  the board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to (A) issue warrants of series 2024/2028 to the Subsidiary (as defined below) and (B) approve the transfer of warrants series 2024/2028 from the Subsidiary to the Employees in accordance with item 12.B below. Items (A) and (B) constitute an overall proposal and shall be resolved upon as one resolution by the annual general meeting. Item 12.A - Directed issue of warrants For the implementation of Warrant Program 2024/2028  the board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to issue a maximum of 500 000 warrants of series 2024/2028  implying an increase in the share capital upon full exercise with a maximum of SEK 25 000. For the decision  the following conditions shall apply: No more than 500 000 warrants shall be issued. With the exception of shareholders' preferential rights  the subscriber shall be the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary Acconeer Incentive AB  reg. no. 559156-2474 (the "" Subsidiary "")  with the right and obligation for the Subsidiary to transfer the warrants to the Employees in accordance with item B below. The warrants shall be issued free of charge to the Subsidiary. Subscription of warrants shall be made on a special subscription list within two weeks from the date of the issue resolution. The board of directors is entitled to extend the subscription period. Over-subscription cannot occur. Each warrant entitles the holder to subscribe for one (1) share in the Company. 6. Subscription of shares under the warrants may take place during the period from 15 February 2028 up to and including 30 April 2028. The premium per share shall be transferred to the free share premium reserve (Sw. fria överkursfonden). 7. The subscription price per share shall correspond to 150 per cent of the volume weighted average price according to Nasdaq First North Growth Market's official curriculum list for shares in the Company during the period of ten (10) trading days ending on 15 November 2024  however the subscription price per share shall never be less than the quota value of the share. The subscription price shall be rounded to the nearest SEK 0.01  whereupon SEK 0.005 shall be rounded upwards. 1The shares subscribed for on the basis of the warrants shall entitle the holder to a distribution of profits for the first time on the first record date of dividends that occur after the subscription of shares has been exercised through the exercise of the warrants. Applicable re-calculation terms and other terms and conditions for the warrants can be found in "" Terms and conditions for warrants series 2024/2028 for new subscription of shares in Acconeer AB (publ) "". The board of directors  or the one the board of directors appoints  is authorised to make minor amendments to the annual general meeting's decisions and attachments that may prove necessary in connection with the registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office or  where applicable  Euroclear Sweden AB. Item 12.B - Approval of transfer of warrants to Employees Warrant Program 2024/2028 shall be carried out mainly as described below. The warrants shall  for payment  be transferred by the Subsidiary on 22 November 2024  or on the later date decided by the board of directors  to the Employees in accordance with the guidelines set out below. Transfer according to item 12.B.1 shall be made at market value at the respective transfer dates  which shall be determined by Optionspartner AB or another independent valuation institute  using the Black & Scholes valuation model. Warrants shall be allotted in accordance with the following guidelines: On each respective transfer date  every Employee shall be given the opportunity to acquire warrants to an amount equivalent to no more than one fifth (1/5) of the Employee's annual income prior to income tax. No more than 500 000 warrants in total may be allotted on each occasion. There will be no guaranteed allotment and over-subscription cannot occur. In case the subscription of warrants exceeds the highest amount of warrants which may be allotted  allotment of warrants will be made proportionally in accordance with each Employee's annual income prior to income tax or  to the extent that allotment cannot be made this way  by the drawing of lots. Transfer of warrants may not take place after the annual general meeting 2025  after which non- transferred warrants shall be cancelled. Such cancellation of warrants shall be reported to the Swedish Companies Registration Office for duly registration. The right to transfer warrants in Warrant Program 2024/2028 assumes that (i) the Employee holds his/her position or has signed an agreement thereon by the time of the allotment and not announced or been informed at that time that the employment is intended to be terminated  (ii) that acquisition of warrants can take place in accordance with applicable laws and  according to the board of directors' assessment  can be executed with reasonable administrative costs and financial efforts  and (iii) that the Employee and/or  in applicable cases  the participant's company has entered into an agreement with the Company  according to which the Company  or the one the Company assigns  under certain circumstances has the right to repurchase the warrants from the participant/company if the participant's employment/consultancy assignment ceases or if the participant/company wishes to transfer the warrants before they can be exercised for subscription of shares. The board of directors has the right to make the reasonable changes and amendments to the terms and conditions of the agreement that are deemed suitable or appropriate as a result of local employment law or tax law or administrative conditions. For participants in other jurisdictions than Sweden  it is implied that transfer of warrants is legally possible and that transfer  in the board of directors' opinion  can be carried out with reasonable administrative and financial efforts at their established fair market value. The board of directors shall be authorised to amend the terms and conditions of the Warrants Program 2024/2028 to 2the extent required in order for allotment of warrants to participants in other jurisdictions  to the extent practically possible  to be carried out under the same conditions imposed by the Warrants Program 2024/2028. Award criteria No award criteria  beyond what is stated in item 12.B.6 above  have been resolved upon to receive allocation in the incentive program. The board of directors believes that a broad program that includes all Employees provides the best conditions to achieve the board of directors' goals of implementing the program: committed  motivated and competent co-workers. Valuation Subscription of the warrants shall be made at a price equal to the warrant's fair market value the day of subscription. The warrants' fair market value  according to a preliminary valuation based on assumptions of the market value of the underlying share of SEK 7.60 at subscription and an exercise price of SEK 11.40 per share  SEK 1.80 per warrant. The Black & Scholes valuation model has been used for the valuation  assuming a risk-free interest rate of 2.411 per cent and a volatility assumption of 55.3 per cent  taking into account the expected dividends and other value transfers to the shareholders. With respect to restrictions on disposal of  and the illiquidity in the warrants  a so-called illiquidity discount of 15.0 per cent has been applied to the warrants' value. The final price for the warrants will be established in connection with each subscription occasion to the Employees and will be based on market conditions prevailing at that time. Costs Since the warrants are subscribed for at market value  the Company is of the opinion that there will be no social costs for the Company as a result of the issue. However  some costs may arise if the subscription price exceeds the initially estimated market value. The costs will therefore mainly consist of limited costs for the implementation and administration of the warrants. Warrant Program 2024/2028 is not expected to entail any costs of significance to the Company. For this reason  no measures for hedging the program have been taken. Dilution  previous incentive programs and effects on key ratios As per the day of this proposal  there are 26 637 783 shares in the Company. Assuming that all warrants that can be issued under Warrant Program 2024/2028 are exercised for subscription of new shares  the number of shares and votes in the Company will increase by 500 000  which corresponds to a dilution of approximately 1.84 per cent of the number of shares and votes in Company. The dilution is expected to have a marginal impact on the Company's key ratios. The Company currently has five ongoing share-based incentive programs: Warrant Program 2021/2024:1  Warrant Program 2021/2024:2  Warrant Program 2022/2026  Warrant Program 2023/2026 and Warrant Program 2023/2027. The annual general meeting resolved on 27 April 2021 to issue a maximum of 300 000 warrants to the Subsidiary  which as of today holds 82 497 of these  through Warrant Program 2021/2024:1. The incentive program includes the persons who are or will be employed by the Company (but not fixed-term employees) including the CEO of the Company. The warrant holders have the right to  during the period from and including 15 May 2024 to and including 30 September 2024  call for subscription of a new share in the Company at a subscription price corresponding to 130 per cent of the volume weighted average price according to Nasdaq First North Growth Market's official curriculum list for shares in the Company during the period of ten (10) trading days ending on 23 April 2021. The annual general meeting resolved on 27 April 2021 to issue a maximum of 300 000 warrants to the Subsidiary  which as of today holds 192 862 of these  through Warrant Program 2021/2024:2. The incentive program includes the persons who are or will be employed by the Company (but not fixed-term employees) including the CEO of the Company. The warrant holders have the right to  during the period 3from and including 15 November 2024 to and including 31 Mars 2025  call for subscription of a new share in the Company at a subscription price corresponding to 130 per cent of the volume weighted average price according to Nasdaq First North Growth Market's official curriculum list for shares in the Company during the period of ten (10) trading days beginning on 28 October 2021. The annual general meeting resolved on 26 April 2022 to issue a maximum of 300 000 warrants to the Subsidiary  which as of today holds 76 485 of these  through Warrant Program 2022/2026. The incentive program includes the persons who are or will be employed by the Company (but not fixed-term employees) including the CEO of the Company. The warrant holders have the right to  during the period from and including 3 December 2025 to and including 16 January 2026  call for subscription of a new share in the Company at a subscription price corresponding to 150 per cent of the volume weighted average price according to Nasdaq First North Growth Market's official curriculum list for shares in the Company during the period of ten (10) trading days beginning on 11 November 2022. The annual general meeting resolved on 26 April 2022 to issue a maximum of 300 000 warrants to the Subsidiary  which as of today holds 166 197 of these  through Warrant Program 2023/2026. The incentive program includes the persons who are or will be employed by the Company (but not fixed-term employees) including the CEO of the Company. The warrant holders have the right to  during the period from and including 25 March 2026 to and including 8 May 2026  call for subscription of a new share in the Company at a subscription price corresponding to 150 per cent of the volume weighted average price according to Nasdaq First North Growth Market's official curriculum list for shares in the Company during the period of ten (10) trading days beginning on 3 March 2023. The annual general meeting resolved on 27 April 2023 to issue a maximum of 500 000 warrants to the Subsidiary  which as of today holds 500 000 of these  through Warrant Program 2023/2027. The incentive program includes the persons who are or will be employed by the Company (but not fixed-term employees) including the CEO of the Company. The warrant holders have the right to  during the period from and including 24 March 2027 up to and including 5 May 2027  call for subscription of a new share in the Company at a subscription price corresponding to 150 per cent of the volume weighted average price according to Nasdaq First North Growth Market's official curriculum list for shares in the Company during the period of ten (10) trading days ending on 8 March 2024. If (i) all outstanding warrants issued in connection with the ongoing incentive programs  including the warrants from Warrant Program 2023/2027 currently held by the Subsidiary  however  excluding the other warrants held by the Subsidiary  are exercised in full for subscription of shares  (ii) the general meeting resolves on the implementation of Warrant Program 2024/2028 in accordance with the proposal  and (iii) all warrants that can be issued in or in connection with Warrant Program 2024/2028 are exercised for subscription of shares  the number of shares and votes in the Company will increase by 1 681 959  which corresponds to a total dilution of approximately 5.94 per cent of the number of shares and votes in the Company. The above estimates are subject to revaluations of the warrants under the usual translation terms contained in the full terms. All dilution effects have been calculated as the number of additional shares in relation to the number of existing plus additional shares. Preparation of the proposal The proposal for resolution on the implementation of Warrant Program 2024/2028 and the proposals of resolutions according to item 12.A and 12.B above  have been prepared by the board of directors together with external advisors. Board members will not be allotted. The CEO  who may be granted warrants in Warrant Program 2024/2028  has not participated in the preparation of the proposal. 4",neutral,0.06,0.93,0.02,negative,0.01,0.47,0.52,True,English,"['warrant program', 'Acconeer', 'Item', 'Proposal', 'resolution', 'March', '08:10', 'Nasdaq First North Growth Market', 'volume weighted average price', 'free share premium reserve', 'Swedish Companies Registration Office', 'subsidiary Acconeer Incentive AB', 'annual general meeting', ""shareholders' preferential rights"", 'Sw. fria överkursfonden', 'official curriculum list', 'ten (10) trading days', 'independent valuation institute', 'Scholes valuation model', 'first record date', 'favourable economic development', 'warrant-based incentive program', 'Applicable re-calculation terms', 'special subscription list', 'respective transfer dates', 'fixed time period', 'first time', 'Employees Warrant Program', 'market value', 'Acconeer AB', 'Companies Act', 'Swedish text', 'value development', 'Optionspartner AB', 'later date', 'subscription price', 'English text', 'unofficial translation', 'English translation', 'Chapter 16 section', 'second paragraph', 'competent, motivated', 'overall proposal', 'one resolution', 'two weeks', '150 per cent', 'quota value', 'other terms', 'minor amendments', 'Euroclear Sweden', 'share capital', 'one (1) share', 'new subscription', 'full exercise', 'following guidelines', 'subscription period', 'committed employees', 'issue resolution', 'nearest SEK', 'following conditions', ""directors' proposal"", 'warrants series', '500,000 warrants', 'case', 'discrepancies', 'board', 'decision', 'approval', 'item', 'Background', 'motive', 'publ', 'Company', 'individuals', 'CEO', 'accordance', 'purpose', 'reasons', 'deviation', 'access', 'participation', 'accountability', 'motivation', 'recruitment', 'retention', 'light', 'implementation', 'maximum', 'increase', 'exception', 'subscriber', 'reg.', 'obligation', 'charge', 'shares', 'place', '15 February', '30 April', '15 November', 'basis', 'distribution', 'profits', 'dividends', 'attachments', 'connection', 'payment', '22 November', 'B.1', 'Black', 'opportunity']",2024-03-12,2024-03-13,marketscreener.com

This is a real consecration for Bitcoin which on 11 March 2024 was quoted at around 72 000 dollars  while Ethereum was at $4 000 (ETH ETFs are expected very soon).BlackRock and Fidelity have achieved the best ETF launches in 30 years thanks to Bitcoin. In their first month of trading  the “IBIT” and “FBTC” funds raised $6.5 billion  which is more than any of the 5 500 other index funds launched before them (according to Les Échos of 10 January 2024: “Bitcoin ETF: the SEC opens the doors of Wall Street wide to Bitcoin”.This is a new record for Bitcoin. Of the 5 535 ETFs launched over the last thirty years  none have gotten off to such a strong start as BlackRock's ‘IBIT' and Fidelity's ‘FBTC'  said Bloomberg expert Eric Balchunas.This Monday  March 11  2024  a Bloomberg report (by Tom Metcalf & Emily Nicolle) announces “The London Stock Exchange said it will start accepting applications for the admission of exchange traded notes backed by Bitcoin and Ether” in the second quarter  confirming London as the capital of cryptocurrencies on the European continent.This allows retail and professional investors to gain exposure to the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization  without having to directly hold the asset.Via cryptocurrencies  new collectors and art enthusiasts have been attracted to the art market  often younger than their predecessors. Not averse to speculation and the excitement of taking risks  these art enthusiasts and collectors solidly welded to their crypto-universe of Web 3.0.The near future of Artprice by Artmarket is the meeting place between Web 3.0. (Metaverse and NFT) and Artprice's artificial intelligence  its Intuitive Artmarket ® AI.The 2023 period in NFT auctions  significantly less speculative than the two previous years  allowed Digital Art to finally settle peacefully in the international cultural and economic environment. As the NFT market consolidates  Artprice draws up a summary of the transactions on NFTs hammered in auction rooms in 2023  dominated by Sotheby's  but which finished with Christie's “Next Wave” sale on the sidelines of the Art Basel Miami Beach fair.Monthly evolution of proceeds from public NFT auctions[ https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2024/03/image1-monthly-evolution-of-proceeds-from-public-nft-auctions.png ]“Artprice by Artmarket.com recognizes in Digital Art – whether via NFTs or Artificial Intelligence – a revolution that it would be infinitely better to support and accompany than to reject or denigrate”  affirms thierry Ehrmann  CEO of Artmarket.com and Founder of Artprice.“Artprice subscriptions will soon be able to be paid in ETH and BTC  and our databases have already been adapted to accommodate these two cryptocurrencies. We are very proud to support digital artists with the opening of our Standardized Marketplace to NFTs. Furthermore  we acquired and presented the works Flow (2023) by digital artist Josh Pierce on the cover of our latest Annual Report of the Contemporary Art Market in 2023 and the NFT work Chaos under the pure light by artist 1dontknows for our Annual 2023 Art Market report published in 2024.”Annual Report of the Contemporary Art Market in 2023:https://imgpublic.artprice.com/pdf/le-marche-de-lart-contemporain-2023.pdfhttps://imgpublic.artprice.com/pdf/the-contemporary-art-market-report-2023.pdfAnnual 2023 Art Market report published in 2024:https://imgpublic.artprice.com/pdf/le-marche-de-lart-en-2023.pdfhttps://imgpublic.artprice.com/pdf/the-art-market-in-2023.pdfThis NFT paradigm shift is well explained in the ARTE documentary  recently released in 5 languages: “NFT  Chaos in the art world”https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_08d_1oY-LoThroughout this documentary  thierry Ehrmann  visual artist  NFT artist and Founding CEO of Artprice.com  delivers his analysis accompanied by other artists  experts and international players in the world of Art NFTs.Any attempt to understand the significance of NFTs in Art History requires an appreciation of the digital and cultural revolution that they represent and some kind of prediction regarding their role and impact over the short and medium term.According to thierry Ehrmann “In its various annual reports on the Art Market and the regulated information it publishes as a listed company  Artprice by Artmarket.com has always said with regard to NFTs that it is impossible to apprehend this new market without a true understanding of Blockchain  crypto-currencies and their cultural origins among the Cypherpunks (period of PGP-type data encryption at the beginning of the 1990s).”Bearing in mind all the underlying parameters and data required  Artprice by Artmarket is the only organization on the global art market to be able to truly respond to the certification of primary issues of Art NFTs in an environment of cryptocurrencies and major international currencies.In 2024  Artprice will be uniquely positioned in its capacity as a certifier of primary issues of Art NFTs based on the fact that Artprice by Artmarket has been the Global Leader in Art Market Information for more than 27 years and is the creator and owner of its globally recognized databases. It also has the world's largest documentary collection of art market notes  manuscripts  codices and annotated sales catalogs from 1700 to the present day  which act as a guarantee of the authenticity and historical veracity of its databases.1.

Seven-digit auction results and other exceptional salesIn 2023  the seven best results of the year in the NFT category were hammered for Generative Art. This self-generating and random artistic approach is at the heart of the history of NFTs  notably with the controversial Profile Pictures (PFP) series such as the Bored Apes and the CryptoKitties. However  these series have now left their place at the forefront of the Generative scene to the abstract works created by artists like Dmitri Cherniak and Tyler Hobbs. Indeed  the series Autoglyph by Larva Labs now fetches higher prices than their CryptoPunks which made the artist duo famous.Among the most anticipated pieces last year at auction  five digital creations created by Keith Haring at the end of the 1980s were put on sale at Christie's in September 2023 by the Keith Haring Foundation. In the form of five unique NFTs (#1/1)  these experiments were carried out on the first computers equipped with digital creation software a few years after those conducted by Andy Warhol.

Both in auction rooms and on the MetaverseSotheby's now stands out as the most active auction house on the NFT market  regularly hosting sessions dedicated to this new medium. On 15 June 2023  Part II of its sale Grails: Property from an Iconic Digital Art Collection totaled $10.9 million in New York. But apart from these sales dedicated to NFTs  Sotheby's now also includes NFTs in general sessions: at its day sale of Contemporary Art on 19 May 2023 in New York  Tyler Hobbs' Fidenza #725 (2021) fetched over a million dollars (including fees)  against an estimated range of $120 000 - $180 000.https://www.artprice.com/artist/1062390/tyler-hobbs/nft/30222588/fidenza-725Under Patrick Drahi's leadership  Sotheby's has also deployed a brand new platform called Metaverse  entirely dedicated to Web3: https://metaverse.sothebys.com . In 2023  it hosted the sale of 5 000 photographs by Sebastião Salgado in the form of NFTs  then a session entitled Snow Crash curated by artist Tony Sheeder  and lastly  a sale of 500 unique works generated by the pioneer Vera Molnar (who sadly passed away shortly after on 7 December 2023).The projects carried out by Sotheby's on its Metaverse platform  however  deviate somewhat from public sales in terms of transparency and communication of results and are undoubtedly more similar to private sales. Several important NFT works are still visible today on the sothebys-grails.eth wallet and are – according to Michael Bouhanna (VP  Contemporary Art Specialist & Head of Digital Art and NFTs at Sotheby's) – available for private sale:CryptoPunk #6669:https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0xb47e3cd837ddf8e4c57f05d70ab865de6e193bbb/6669Fidenza #526:https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0xa7d8d9ef8d8ce8992df33d8b8cf4aebabd5bd270/78000526Bored Ape #8552:https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0xbc4ca0eda7647a8ab7c2061c2e118a18a936f13d/85524. ‘On-chain' versus ‘off-chain' transactionsThe majority of NFT artworks publicly auctioned by Sotheby's have so far gone through its main website  not through its Metaverse  and the transactions have therefore taken place outside the Blockchain. In other words  they were concluded “off-chain”; the hammer prices do not appear in the history of the NFT  where only a double transfer of ownership of the work is visible: from the seller's portfolio (of the artist or collector) to that of Sotheby's  and then from Sotheby's to the buyer's wallet  once payment is complete.These “off-chain” transactions allow the auction house to maintain greater control over the transactions  in particular to collect payment before transferring the work to its new owner. This allows Sotheby's to collect a commission by adding the usual fees. For its part  Christie's  which carries out “on-chain” transactions via its Christie's 3.0 platform https://nft.christies.com   does without a commission. Its FAQ specifies that “ Christie's 3.0 does not add Buyer's Premium to the hammer price” and that “You will need to pay a gas fee when you place a bid and  if applicable  when you pay sales tax and collect your NFT  Gas fees are not included in the final purchase price”. But these gas fees only concern the operating costs of the Blockchain and are not collected by the auction house.5. The entry of NFTs into museum collectionsThe year 2023 saw the first acquisitions of NFTs by several museums  starting with the most prestigious  the LACMA  the MoMA  the Pompidou Center  and the Granet Museum in Aix-en-Provence. Unlike the ambiguous situation of 2021 which saw several institutions put digital duplicates of their masterpieces on sale  it is now a matter of acquisitions of NFTs by museums  directly from artists or via their collectors.CryptoPunks #110 acquired by the Center Pompidou andCryptoPunks #3831 acquired by LACMAThe reluctance of auction houses regarding “on-chain” transactions is shared by museums  which are subject to strict regulations regarding the acquisition of works. The procedures they must follow sometimes conflict with the principles of transparency and decentralization of Web3. Public institutions therefore prefer for the moment to acquire “off-chain” works and avoid placing all their NFT artworks in a single wallet.The Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA)  which received a donation of 22 NFTs in February 2023 from anonymous collector Cozomo de' Medici  has only 8 pieces on its e-wallet. Several NFTs  like Fragments of an Infinite Field #972 by Monica Rizzolli  have not yet been delivered and are still on the Cozomo de' Medici wallet. As for the famous CryptoPunk #3831  the work has been placed in an independent portfolio.Official announcement of the 22 NFTs acquired by LACMA:https://unframed.lacma.org/2023/02/24/new-acquisition-cozomo-de-medici-collectionLACMA Collection on Opensea:https://opensea.io/0x9482B7FEF251Ebb81CeF01108c5512C27520003DFragments of an Infinite Field #972 de Monica Rizzolli :https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0xa7d8d9ef8d8ce8992df33d8b8cf4aebabd5bd270/159000972CryptoPunk #3831 by Larva Labs :https://opensea.io/0x0f7f63BA74681EfC4eab9777a463E2aF45916EDfMarcella Lista  Head Curator at the Centre Pompidou explains the procedure followed by the French museum to make its first NFT acquisitions:“The Center Pompidou has opened a digital wallet exclusively dedicated to the reception and conservation of tokens  knowing that the files of the works have been uploaded in parallel to be stored on the conservation servers of the Pompidou Center as is the case with any digital work in the collection. The works were acquired via a classic acquisition and distribution authorization contract  following the museum 's usual practice  and were paid in euros.“The various states of visibility of these works on NFT platforms and on the Pompidou Center database can be explained by the long contractualization procedure  their registration on our inventory  and their entry into the database. Works that have not yet appeared are being processed in this administrative  accounting and technical chain.”The Centre Pompidou NFT collection on Opensea:https://opensea.io/Centre_Pompidou_MNAMCryptoPunk #110 from the Centre Pompidou:https://cryptopunks.app/cryptopunks/details/1106. A reassuring start to 2024Auction houses Christie's and Sotheby's have started 2024 with one and two sales respectively dedicated to NFTs. Patrick Drahi's company has already taken the lead this year  generating 92% of the segment's turnover.Sotheby's sessions GRAILS: Starry Night and Natively Digital: An Ordinals Curated Sale totaled over $1 million each  with 19 and 18 lots sold respectively  and no unsold lots. One of the best results was hammered for Genesis Cat  for Taproot Wizards (2024) by digital artist FAR. It was generally believed that the NFT market was now focused on more ‘serious' creations  but this off-beat work – reminiscent of CryptoKitties – fetched the best NFT result at the start of 2024: $254 000 versus an estimated range of $15 000 to $20 000 (January 22 at Sotheby's in New York).https://www.sothebys.com/en/buy/auction/2024/natively-digital-an-ordinals-curated-sale/genesis-cat?locale=frAuction results exceeding $100 000 for Satoshi Nakamoto  Xcopy  Beeple and Des Lucréce continue to show that the success of these digital artists is not just anecdotal. In 2024 we will probably see a consolidation of the prices of works by these key signatures on the NFT market. And the rising values of Bitcoin and Ethereum will no doubt contribute to this progression.7. Top 50 Artists by NFT p ublic a uction turnover in 20231.

Larva Labs – Autoglyph #187 : $571 50…,"PARIS  March 12  2024 /PRNewswire/ -- The year 2023 started with the first acquisitions of NFTs by museums and ended with another bull run on the stock markets and the main cryptocurrencies.The major event in cryptocurrencies is notably BlackRock's (the largest asset manager in the world) and Fidelity's introduction of ETFs directly invested in Bitcoin (Bitcoin spot ETFs) authorized by the SEC on 11 January 2024. This is a real consecration for Bitcoin which on 11 March 2024 was quoted at around 72 000 dollars  while Ethereum was at $4 000 (ETH ETFs are expected very soon).BlackRock and Fidelity have achieved the best ETF launches in 30 years thanks to Bitcoin. In their first month of trading  the ""IBIT"" and ""FBTC"" funds raised $6.5 billion  which is more than any of the 5 500 other index funds launched before them (according to Les Échos of 10 January 2024: ""Bitcoin ETF: the SEC opens the doors of Wall Street wide to Bitcoin"".This is a new record for Bitcoin. Of the 5 535 ETFs launched over the last thirty years  none have gotten off to such a strong start as BlackRock's 'IBIT' and Fidelity's 'FBTC'  said Bloomberg expert Eric Balchunas.This Monday  March 11  2024  a Bloomberg report (by Tom Metcalf & Emily Nicolle) announces ""The London Stock Exchange said it will start accepting applications for the admission of exchange traded notes backed by Bitcoin and Ether"" in the second quarter  confirming London as the capital of cryptocurrencies on the European continent.This allows retail and professional investors to gain exposure to the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization  without having to directly hold the asset.Via cryptocurrencies  new collectors and art enthusiasts have been attracted to the art market  often younger than their predecessors. Not averse to speculation and the excitement of taking risks  these art enthusiasts and collectors solidly welded to their crypto-universe of Web 3.0.The near future of Artprice by Artmarket is the meeting place between Web 3.0. (Metaverse and NFT) and Artprice's artificial intelligence  its Intuitive Artmarket ® AI.The 2023 period in NFT auctions  significantly less speculative than the two previous years  allowed Digital Art to finally settle peacefully in the international cultural and economic environment. As the NFT market consolidates  Artprice draws up a summary of the transactions on NFTs hammered in auction rooms in 2023  dominated by Sotheby's  but which finished with Christie's ""Next Wave"" sale on the sidelines of the Art Basel Miami Beach fair.Monthly evolution of proceeds from public NFT auctionsInfographic - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2360542/NFT_auctions_1_Infographic.jpg[https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2024/03/image1-monthly-evolution-of-proceeds-from-public-nft-auctions.png]""Artprice by Artmarket.com recognizes in Digital Art – whether via NFTs or Artificial Intelligence – a revolution that it would be infinitely better to support and accompany than to reject or denigrate""  affirms thierry Ehrmann  CEO of Artmarket.com and Founder of Artprice.""Artprice subscriptions will soon be able to be paid in ETH and BTC  and our databases have already been adapted to accommodate these two cryptocurrencies.

It also has the world's largest documentary collection of art market notes  manuscripts  codices and annotated sales catalogs from 1700 to the present day  which act as a guarantee of the authenticity and historical veracity of its databases.1.

Seven-digit auction results and other exceptional salesIn 2023  the seven best results of the year in the NFT category were hammered for Generative Art. This self-generating and random artistic approach is at the heart of the history of NFTs  notably with the controversial Profile Pictures (PFP) series such as the Bored Apes and the CryptoKitties. However  these series have now left their place at the forefront of the Generative scene to the abstract works created by artists like Dmitri Cherniak and Tyler Hobbs. Indeed  the series Autoglyph by Larva Labs now fetches higher prices than their CryptoPunks which made the artist duo famous.Among the most anticipated pieces last year at auction  five digital creations created by Keith Haring at the end of the 1980s were put on sale at Christie's in September 2023 by the Keith Haring Foundation. In the form of five unique NFTs (#1/1)  these experiments were carried out on the first computers equipped with digital creation software a few years after those conducted by Andy Warhol. All the works found buyers at prices between $250 000 and $350 000.https://onlineonly.christies.com/s/keith-haring-pixel-pioneer/lots/3479?sc_lang=enTop 20 results for NFT works sold at auction in 20231.

Both in auction rooms and on the MetaverseSotheby's now stands out as the most active auction house on the NFT market  regularly hosting sessions dedicated to this new medium. On 15 June 2023  Part II of its sale Grails: Property from an Iconic Digital Art Collection totaled $10.9 million in New York. But apart from these sales dedicated to NFTs  Sotheby's now also includes NFTs in general sessions: at its day sale of Contemporary Art on 19 May 2023 in New York  Tyler Hobbs' Fidenza #725 (2021) fetched over a million dollars (including fees)  against an estimated range of $120 000 - $180 000.https://www.artprice.com/artist/1062390/tyler-hobbs/nft/30222588/fidenza-725Under Patrick Drahi's leadership  Sotheby's has also deployed a brand new platform called Metaverse  entirely dedicated to Web3: https://metaverse.sothebys.com. In 2023  it hosted the sale of 5 000 photographs by Sebastião Salgado in the form of NFTs  then a session entitled Snow Crash curated by artist Tony Sheeder  and lastly  a sale of 500 unique works generated by the pioneer Vera Molnar (who sadly passed away shortly after on 7 December 2023).The projects carried out by Sotheby's on its Metaverse platform  however  deviate somewhat from public sales in terms of transparency and communication of results and are undoubtedly more similar to private sales. Several important NFT works are still visible today on the sothebys-grails.eth wallet and are – according to Michael Bouhanna (VP  Contemporary Art Specialist & Head of Digital Art and NFTs at Sotheby's) – available for private sale:CryptoPunk #6669:https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0xb47e3cd837ddf8e4c57f05d70ab865de6e193bbb/6669Fidenza #526:https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0xa7d8d9ef8d8ce8992df33d8b8cf4aebabd5bd270/78000526Bored Ape #8552:https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0xbc4ca0eda7647a8ab7c2061c2e118a18a936f13d/85524. 'On-chain' versus 'off-chain' transactionsThe majority of NFT artworks publicly auctioned by Sotheby's have so far gone through its main website  not through its Metaverse  and the transactions have therefore taken place outside the Blockchain. In other words  they were concluded ""off-chain""; the hammer prices do not appear in the history of the NFT  where only a double transfer of ownership of the work is visible: from the seller's portfolio (of the artist or collector) to that of Sotheby's  and then from Sotheby's to the buyer's wallet  once payment is complete.These ""off-chain"" transactions allow the auction house to maintain greater control over the transactions  in particular to collect payment before transferring the work to its new owner. This allows Sotheby's to collect a commission by adding the usual fees. For its part  Christie's  which carries out ""on-chain"" transactions via its Christie's 3.0 platform https://nft.christies.com  does without a commission. Its FAQ specifies that "" Christie's 3.0 does not add Buyer's Premium to the hammer price"" and that ""You will need to pay a gas fee when you place a bid and  if applicable  when you pay sales tax and collect your NFT  Gas fees are not included in the final purchase price"". But these gas fees only concern the operating costs of the Blockchain and are not collected by the auction house.5. The entry of NFTs into museum collectionsThe year 2023 saw the first acquisitions of NFTs by several museums  starting with the most prestigious  the LACMA  the MoMA  the Pompidou Center  and the Granet Museum in Aix-en-Provence. Unlike the ambiguous situation of 2021 which saw several institutions put digital duplicates of their masterpieces on sale  it is now a matter of acquisitions of NFTs by museums  directly from artists or via their collectors.CryptoPunks #110 acquired by the Center Pompidou andCryptoPunks #3831 acquired by LACMAThe reluctance of auction houses regarding ""on-chain"" transactions is shared by museums  which are subject to strict regulations regarding the acquisition of works. The procedures they must follow sometimes conflict with the principles of transparency and decentralization of Web3. Public institutions therefore prefer for the moment to acquire ""off-chain"" works and avoid placing all their NFT artworks in a single wallet.The Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA)  which received a donation of 22 NFTs in February 2023 from anonymous collector Cozomo de' Medici  has only 8 pieces on its e-wallet. Several NFTs  like Fragments of an Infinite Field #972 by Monica Rizzolli  have not yet been delivered and are still on the Cozomo de' Medici wallet. As for the famous CryptoPunk #3831  the work has been placed in an independent portfolio.Official announcement of the 22 NFTs acquired by LACMA:https://unframed.lacma.org/2023/02/24/new-acquisition-cozomo-de-medici-collectionLACMA Collection on Opensea:https://opensea.io/0x9482B7FEF251Ebb81CeF01108c5512C27520003DFragments of an Infinite Field #972 de Monica Rizzolli :https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0xa7d8d9ef8d8ce8992df33d8b8cf4aebabd5bd270/159000972CryptoPunk #3831 by Larva Labs :https://opensea.io/0x0f7f63BA74681EfC4eab9777a463E2aF45916EDfMarcella Lista  Head Curator at the Centre Pompidou explains the procedure followed by the French museum to make its first NFT acquisitions:""The Center Pompidou has opened a digital wallet exclusively dedicated to the reception and conservation of tokens  knowing that the files of the works have been uploaded in parallel to be stored on the conservation servers of the Pompidou Center as is the case with any digital work in the collection. The works were acquired via a classic acquisition and distribution authorization contract  following the museum's usual practice  and were paid in euros.""The various states of visibility of these works on NFT platforms and on the Pompidou Center database can be explained by the long contractualization procedure  their registration on our inventory  and their entry into the database. Works that have not yet appeared are being processed in this administrative  accounting and technical chain.""The Centre Pompidou NFT collection on Opensea:https://opensea.io/Centre_Pompidou_MNAMCryptoPunk #110 from the Centre Pompidou:https://cryptopunks.app/cryptopunks/details/1106. A reassuring start to 2024Auction houses Christie's and Sotheby's have started 2024 with one and two sales respectively dedicated to NFTs. Patrick Drahi's company has already taken the lead this year  generating 92% of the segment's turnover.Sotheby's sessions GRAILS: Starry Night and Natively Digital: An Ordinals Curated Sale totaled over $1 million each  with 19 and 18 lots sold respectively  and no unsold lots. One of the best results was hammered for Genesis Cat  for Taproot Wizards (2024) by digital artist FAR. It was generally believed that the NFT market was now focused on more 'serious' creations  but this off-beat work – reminiscent of CryptoKitties – fetched the best NFT result at the start of 2024: $254 000 versus an estimated range of $15 000 to $20 000 (January 22 at Sotheby's in New York).https://www.sothebys.com/en/buy/auction/2024/natively-digital-an-ordinals-curated-sale/genesis-cat?locale=frAuction results exceeding $100 000 for Satoshi Nakamoto  Xcopy  Beeple and Des Lucréce continue to show that the success of these digital artists is not just anecdotal. In 2024 we will probably see a consolidation of the prices of works by these key signatures on the NFT market. And the rising values of Bitcoin and Ethereum will no doubt contribute to this progression.7. Top 50 Artists by NFT public auction turnover in 20231.

Unacceptable behaviour will not be tolerated at the Meeting and it will be dealt with appropriately by the Chair of the Meeting.Porvair plc Notice of Annual General Meeting 2024 07 Explanatory notes to the resolutions Resolutions 1 to 14 will be proposed as ordinary resolutions. For each of these to be passed  more than half of the votes cast must be in favour of the relevant resolution. Resolutions 15 to 18 will be proposed as special resolutions. For each of these to be passed  at least three quarters of the votes cast must be in favour of the resolution. An explanation of each of the resolutions is set out below: Resolution 1 - To receive the Company's annual accounts for the year ended 30 November 2023. The Directors are required to present to the Annual General Meeting the audited accounts and the Directors' and Auditor's Reports for the financial year ended 30 November 2023. Resolution 2 - Approval of the Directors' Remuneration Policy. Resolution 2 to be proposed at the Annual General Meeting seeks shareholder approval for the revised Remuneration Policy set out on pages 74 to 82 of the Annual Report. The current Remuneration Policy was approved by shareholders in 2021 and expires after three years. The changes proposed to be made to the Remuneration Policy  and the reasons for the changes proposed  are set out in the Chair of the Remuneration Committee's report on page 65 of the Annual Report. In summary  an external benchmarking exercise showed that executive director pay levels remain below those in companies of similar scale and spread. If the Group's long-term growth record continues  these pay differentials are likely to increase. Shareholder approval is sought to increase flexibility around variable pay by increasing the annual bonus maximum that the Remuneration Committee may award from 100% of base salary to the sector group median level of 125% of base salary. The LTSP policy maximum would remain at its current level of 150% of base salary  which is already in line with market. Should an increase in annual bonus maxima be approved by shareholders  the Committee will exercise discretion as to whether it will actually use the increased headroom. No other changes to the 2021 policy are proposed. If approved by shareholders  the new Remuneration Policy will take effect immediately upon conclusion of the Annual General Meeting. Resolution 3 - To approve the Directors' Remuneration Report. In accordance with section 439 of the Companies Act 2006  shareholders are requested to approve the Directors' Remuneration Report (excluding the Directors' Remuneration Policy set out on pages 74 to 82 of the Annual Report). The Directors' Remuneration Report is set out on pages 65 to 73 of the Annual Report. The vote is advisory and the Directors' entitlement to receive remuneration is not conditional on it. Resolution 4 - To approve the final dividend of 4.0 pence per share. Resolution 4 recommends that a final dividend of 4.0 pence per share be declared for the financial year ended 30 November 2023. If approved  the recommended final dividend will be paid on 5 June 2024 to shareholders on the Company's register of members at 6.00 p.m. on 3 May 2024. Resolutions 5 to 10 - Re-election and election of Directors. Resolutions 5 to 10 are to approve the re-election of the Board. In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code  all the Directors are subject to annual re-election by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting  or  in the case of Sarah Vawda  election by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting. The Directors believe that the Board offers an appropriate balance of knowledge and skills and that all the Non-Executive Directors are independent in character and judgement. Each Director makes an important contribution to the Company's long-term sustainable success. The Nomination Committee  which considers the balance of the Board and the mix of skills  knowledge and experience of its members  has considered and recommends to the Board the appointment of all of the Directors of the Company standing for re-election  and  in the case of Sarah Vawda  for election. The Chair confirms that  following a formal performance evaluation  the Non-Executive Directors continue to demonstrate effective performance and commitment to the role and have sufficient time to meet their responsibilities.

The current appointment of RSM UK Audit LLP as the Company's Auditors will end at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting and it has advised of its willingness to stand for re-appointment.

Resolution 13 - Adoption of the rules of the Porvair plc SAYE Share Option Plan 2024. Resolution 13 requests shareholder approval of the rules of the Porvair plc SAYE Share Option Plan 2024 (""SAYE plan"") in the form produced at the Annual General Meeting.

Resolution 14 is proposed to renew the Directors' power to allot shares. Paragraph 14.1 gives the Directors customary authority to allot ordinary shares or grant such subscription or conversion rights as are contemplated by sections 551(1)(a) and (b) respectively of the Act up to an aggregate nominal amount of £309 068  being an amount equal to approximately one third of the Company's issued share capital as at 1 March 2024 (being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this circular). As at 1 March 2024  the Company did not hold any treasury shares. The authority granted under Resolution 14 shall expire at the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting of the Company or  if earlier  at 6.00 p.m. on 15 July 2025. Resolution 14 replaces a similar resolution passed at the Annual General Meeting of the Company held on 18 April 2023. The Directors have no present intention of exercising the authority under this resolution  but the Board wishes to ensure that it has flexibility in managing the financial resources of the Company. Resolutions 15 and 16 - To disapply pre-emption rights. If the Directors wish to allot shares or other equity securities for cash or sell any shares which the Company holds in treasury  following a purchase of its own shares pursuant to the authority in Resolution 17  the Act requires that such shares or other equity securities are offered first to existing shareholders in proportion to their existing holding. Resolutions 15 and 16 ask shareholders to approve the disapplication of pre-emption rights. The passing of these resolutions would allow the Directors to allot shares for cash and/or sell treasury shares without first having to offer such shares to existing shareholders in proportion to their existing holdings.

Amidst these efforts  a senior European Union official has raised concerns about the potential repercussions on the global financial system  emphasizing the need to retain a portion of the seized assets as a ""safety buffer.""Since the onset of the Ukraine conflict two years ago  the West has frozen approximately USD300 billion in holdings owned by the Russian central bank. Euroclear  a Brussels-based clearing house  holds a significant portion of these assets  amounting to around EUR191 billion (USD205 billion). The European Union is reportedly expediting the decision to allocate the first tranche of up to EUR3 billion from profits generated by these frozen Russian assets to Ukraine  with plans for disbursement as early as July.However  an unnamed European Union official has cautioned against a complete transfer of funds  stressing the importance of maintaining a reserve to safeguard financial stability. The official highlighted potential challenges Euroclear may face  including a surge in claims  raising concerns about the broader impact on the global financial system.The European Union's objective is to ensure that once the conflict concludes and settlements become feasible  all provisionally retained funds will be transferred to Ukraine. Nevertheless  the official acknowledges the necessity of retaining a substantial amount in Euroclear to address potential claims and uncertainties arising from the asset transfer.The looming risk involves the potential response from Moscow if the West proceeds with the expropriation of funds. The official estimates that the Russian central bank might seize approximately EUR33 billion of Euroclear money held in the national securities depository in Moscow. Additionally  there is the possibility of legal action by Russia to seize Euroclear cash from depositories in Hong Kong and Dubai  adding further complexity to the situation.As the European Union navigates this intricate scenario  balancing the imperative to support Ukraine with the need to mitigate global financial risks remains a delicate challenge.

According to the Financial Times  Brussels aims to expedite the decision by seizing the interest earned from assets held at the Euroclear clearinghouse  with the process set to commence in February. The report suggests that a first tranche of funds could be dispatched to Kiev as early as July  contingent on securing unanimous approval from all European Union member states. The proposal is anticipated to be presented before an upcoming summit of European Union leaders.The West has collectively frozen approximately USD300 billion in holdings belonging to the Russian central bank since the outset of the Ukraine conflict two years ago. Of this total  Euroclear  based in Brussels  holds around EUR191 billion (USD205 billion) and has accrued nearly EUR4.4 billion in interest over the past year alone. The European Commission envisions disbursing between EUR2 and EUR3 billion in revenue generated by these frozen assets this year  dependent on prevailing interest rates. European Union officials estimate that the overall profits derived from Russian funds held by Euroclear could potentially reach EUR20 billion by 2027.The urgency of tapping into Russian assets has gained prominence following the blocking of a USD60 billion American aid package to Ukraine by the Republican-led United States Congress.This setback has prompted Kiev to explore alternative sources of funding for its ongoing war effort. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen recently suggested redirecting the proceeds towards supplying weapons to Ukraine  deviating from the initial plan of utilizing the funds for reconstruction.As geopolitical dynamics continue to evolve  the European Union's proactive approach to leveraging frozen Russian assets showcases a determination to provide substantial support to Ukraine  filling the void left by the stalled United States aid package. The impending decision  set to be deliberated at the upcoming European Union leaders' summit  underscores the bloc's commitment to addressing the urgent financial needs of Ukraine and contributing to the ongoing conflict resolution efforts in the region.MENAFN13032024000045015687ID1107971453,neutral,0.07,0.92,0.01,negative,0.04,0.31,0.65,True,English,"['EU', 'money', 'Ukraine', 'summer', 'President Ursula von der Leyen', 'USD60 billion American aid package', ""upcoming European Union leaders' summit"", 'United States aid package', 'Republican-led United States Congress', 'ongoing conflict resolution efforts', 'European Union member states', 'United States assistance', 'ongoing war effort', 'European Union officials', 'Russian central bank', 'urgent financial needs', 'The European Commission', 'prevailing interest rates', 'frozen Russian assets', 'upcoming summit', 'The West', 'financial resilience', 'Financial Times', 'Ukraine conflict', 'strategic move', 'first tranche', 'unanimous approval', 'past year', 'alternative sources', 'initial plan', 'geopolitical dynamics', 'proactive approach', 'substantial support', 'Russian funds', 'overall profits', 'impending decision', 'Euroclear clearinghouse', 'MENAFN', 'decline', 'initiative', 'Brussels', 'process', 'February', 'report', 'Kiev', 'July', 'proposal', 'holdings', 'outset', 'total', 'EUR2', 'EUR3', 'revenue', 'urgency', 'prominence', 'blocking', 'setback', 'funding', 'proceeds', 'weapons', 'reconstruction', 'determination', 'void', 'commitment', 'region']",2024-03-13,2024-03-13,menafn.com

That plan will be discussed at a summit in Brussels March 21-22  according to a draft of the conclusions seen by Bloomberg.Western nations have frozen about €260 billion ($284 billion) in securities and cash  more than two-thirds of it in the European Union. The EU expects to generate around €3 billion per year from these frozen assets  other people said  who spoke on the condition of anonymity.“We have the legal clarity and conditions to allow the use of these revenues to support Ukraine "" EU trade chief Valdis Dombrovskis said on Tuesday. “We are fully committed to moving forward with the next step: to allow redirecting these revenues to the EU budget for the benefit of Ukraine.""Countries including Ireland  Malta and Luxembourg have said the plan — in particular the intention to use the funds to purchase weapons — deserved a more thorough analysis  said the people. Hungary stressed that the revenue should be allocated to Ukraine’s reconstruction.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen first proposed the idea of using the funds to purchase military equipment last month. The commission then discussed the proposal with member states last week  according to the people.Most of the Russian central bank assets are held in Euroclear  a Brussels-based clearing house that invests that money which may earn as much as €15 billion to €20 billion until 2027  one of the people said. Belgium applies a 25% corporate tax to the profit  which may earn €1.7 billion this year.Western allies generally agree that the frozen Russian funds should remain off-limits to Moscow unless it pledges to help with Ukraine’s reconstruction. But they’re at odds over whether it’s lawful to seize the assets outright — so the challenge for the EU is to squeeze funds out without depleting them.France and Germany  along with the European Central Bank  have expressed the most caution. They worry about Russian retaliation targeting European assets there  and also the impact on financial stability and the euro’s status as a reserve currency  Bloomberg reported earlier.--With assistance from Kamil Kowalcze.More stories like this are available on bloomberg.com©2024 Bloomberg L.P.Milestone Alert!

S-3SUPPLEMENTAL DESCRIPTION OF THE SENIOR NOTES The following description of the particular terms of the Senior Notes supplements and in certain instances replaces the description of the general terms and provisions of the Senior Notes under ""Description of the Notes"" in the accompanying prospectus. We will issue the Senior Notes under an Indenture  dated as of November 1  2016  between us and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company  N.A.  as Trustee (the ""Trustee"")  as heretofore supplemented and as to be further supplemented as of the issue date for the Senior Notes. Principal Amount  Maturity  Interest and Payment The Senior Notes will initially be issued in an aggregate principal amount of $450 000 000. We may at any time and from time to time  without consent of the holders of the Senior Notes  issue additional notes having the same ranking  interest rate  maturity and other terms (other than the date of issuance  issue price and  in some circumstances  the initial interest accrual date and initial interest payment date) as the Senior Notes. These additional notes  together with the Senior Notes  will constitute a single series of notes under the Indenture. The Senior Notes will mature and become due and payable  together with any accrued and unpaid interest  on April 1  2034 and will bear interest at the rate of 5.15% per year from March 13  2024 until April 1  2034. The Senior Notes are not subject to any sinking fund provision. Interest on each Senior Note will be payable semi-annually in arrears on each April 1 and October 1 (the ""Interest Payment Date"") and at redemption  if any  or maturity. The initial Interest Payment Date is October 1  2024. Each payment of interest shall include interest accrued from March 13  2024  or the immediately preceding Interest Payment Date  through the day before the next Interest Payment Date. Interest on the Senior Notes will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. We will pay interest on the Senior Notes (other than interest payable at redemption  if any  or maturity) in immediately available funds to the registered holders of the Senior Notes as of the Regular Record Date (as defined below) for each Interest Payment Date. We will pay the principal amount of the Senior Notes and any premium and interest payable at redemption  if any  or at maturity in immediately available funds delivered to the Trustee  and the Trustee will forward such funds to the applicable depositary for payments to its participants for subsequent disbursement to the beneficial owners of the Senior Notes. See - Global Clearance and Settlement Procedures. The Senior Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of $2 000 and integral multiples of $1 000 in excess thereof. If any Interest Payment Date  redemption date or the maturity is not a Business Day (as defined below)  we will pay all amounts due on the next succeeding Business Day and no additional interest will be paid. The ""Regular Record Date"" will be the March 15 or September 15 prior to the relevant Interest Payment Date (whether or not a Business Day). S-4""Business Day"" means any day that is not a Saturday or Sunday or any other day on which banking institutions in New York City are authorized or required by law or regulation to close. Optional Redemption We may redeem the Senior Notes at our option at any time upon no more than 60 and not less than 10 days' notice (either by mail or in compliance with the applicable procedures of DTC). Prior to January 1  2034 (three months prior to the maturity date (the ""Par Call Date""))  we may redeem the Senior Notes at our option  in whole or in part  at any time and from time to time  at a redemption price (expressed as a percentage of principal amount and rounded to three decimal places) equal to the greater of: (a) the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon discounted to the redemption date (assuming the Senior Notes matured on the Par Call Date) on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate plus 20 basis points less (b) interest accrued to the redemption date; andsemi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate plus 20 basis points less (b) interest accrued to the redemption date; and 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes to be redeemed plus  in each case  accrued and unpaid interest thereon to  but excluding  the redemption date. On or after the Par Call Date  we may redeem the Senior Notes at our option  in whole or in part  at any time and from time to time  at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes to be redeemed  plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to  but excluding  the redemption date. For purposes of these redemption provisions  the following term has the following meaning. ""Treasury Rate"" means  with respect to any redemption date  the yield determined by us in accordance with the following two paragraphs. The Treasury Rate shall be determined by us after 4:15 p.m.  New York City time (or after such time as yields on U.S. government securities are posted daily by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System)  on the third business day preceding the redemption date based upon the yield or yields for the most recent day that appear after such time on such day in the most recent statistical release published by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System designated as ""Selected Interest Rates (Daily)-H.15"" (or any successor designation or publication) (""H.15"") under the caption ""U.S. government securities-Treasury constant maturities-Nominal"" (or any successor caption or heading) (""H.15 TCM""). In determining the Treasury Rate  we shall select  as applicable: the yield for the Treasury constant maturity on H.15 exactly equal to the period from the redemption date to the Par Call Date (the ""Remaining Life""); orif there is no such Treasury constant maturity on H.15 exactly equal to the Remaining Life  the two yields-one yield corresponding to the Treasury constant maturity on H.15 immediately shorter than and one yield corresponding to the Treasury constant maturity on H.15 immediately longer than the Remaining Life-and shall interpolate to the Par Call Date on a straight-line basis (using the actual number of days) using such yields and rounding the result to three decimal places; or S-5if there is no such Treasury constant maturity on H.15 shorter than or longer than the Remaining Life  the yield for the single Treasury constant maturity on H.15 closest to the Remaining Life. For purposes of this clause  the applicable Treasury constant maturity or maturities on H.15 shall be deemed to have a maturity date equal to the relevant number of months or years  as applicable  of such Treasury constant maturity from the redemption date. If on the third business day preceding the redemption date H.15 TCM is no longer published  we shall calculate the Treasury Rate based on the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual equivalent yield to maturity at 11:00 a.m.  New York City time  on the second business day preceding such redemption date of the United States Treasury security maturing on  or with a maturity that is closest to the Par Call Date  as applicable. If there is no United States Treasury security maturing on the Par Call Date  but there are two or more United States Treasury securities with a maturity date equally distant from the Par Call Date  one with a maturity date preceding the Par Call Date and one with a maturity date following the Par Call Date  we shall select the United States Treasury security with a maturity date preceding the Par Call Date. If there are two or more United States Treasury securities maturing on the Par Call Date  or two or more United States Treasury securities meeting the criteria of the preceding sentence  we shall select from among these two or more United States Treasury securities the United States Treasury security that is trading closest to par based upon the average of the bid and asked prices for such United States Treasury securities at 11:00 a.m.  New York City time. In determining the Treasury Rate in accordance with the terms of this paragraph  the semi-annual yield to maturity of the applicable United States Treasury security shall be based upon the average of the bid and asked prices (expressed as a percentage of principal amount) at 11:00 a.m.  New York City time  of such United States Treasury security  and rounded to three decimal places. Our actions and determinations in determining the redemption price shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes  absent manifest error. The Trustee shall have no obligation or duty whatsoever to determine  or to verify our calculations of  the redemption price. Covenants Consolidation  Merger or Sale The Company may merge or consolidate with any corporation or sell all or substantially all of its assets as an entirety as long as the successor or purchaser of such assets expressly assumes the payment of principal  and premium  if any  and interest on the Senior Notes.

Limitation on Liens The Company covenants that for so long as any of the Senior Notes are outstanding that it will not create or suffer to exist or permit any of its subsidiaries to create or suffer to exist any Secured Debt  unless  at the same time  the Senior Notes that are outstanding are also secured by such Lien on an equal and ratable basis; provided  however  the foregoing does not limit S-6Permitted Liens; and Any other Lien not covered in clause (i) as long as immediately after the creation of such Lien the aggregate principal amount of Secured Debt does not exceed 10% of Consolidated Tangible Net Assets.

Global Clearance and Settlement Procedures Secondary market trading between Clearstream Banking S.A. (""Clearstream"") participants and/or Euroclear Bank SA/NV  as operator of the Euroclear system (""Euroclear"") participants will occur in the ordinary way in accordance with the applicable rules and operating procedures of Clearstream and Euroclear  as applicable. Cross-market transfers between persons holding directly or indirectly through DTC on the one hand  and directly or indirectly through Clearstream participants or Euroclear system participants on the other  will be effected through DTC in accordance with DTC rules on behalf of the relevant European international clearing system by its U.S. depositary; however  such cross-market transactions will require delivery of instructions to the relevant European international clearing system by the counterparty in such system in accordance with its rules and procedures and within its established deadlines (European time). The relevant European international clearing system will  if the transaction meets its settlement requirements  deliver instructions to its U.S. depositary to take action to effect final settlement on its behalf by delivering or receiving securities in DTC  and making or receiving payment in accordance with normal procedures for same-day funds settlement applicable to DTC. Clearstream participants and Euroclear system participants may not deliver instructions directly to their respective U.S. depositaries. Because of time-zone differences  credits of Notes received in Clearstream or the Euroclear system as a result of a transaction with a DTC participant will be made during subsequent securities settlement processing and dated the Business Day following the DTC settlement date. Such credits or any transactions in such Notes settled during such processing will be reported to the relevant Euroclear system participant or Clearstream participant on such Business Day. Cash received in Clearstream or the Euroclear system as a result of sales of the Notes by or through a Clearstream participant or a Euroclear system participant to a DTC participant will be received with value on the DTC settlement date but will be available in the relevant Clearstream or the Euroclear system cash account only as of the Business Day following settlement in DTC. Additional Information For additional important information about the Senior Notes  see ""Description of the Notes"" in the accompanying prospectus  including: (i) additional information about the terms of the Senior Notes  (ii) general information about the Indenture and the Trustee  and (iii) a description of events of default under the Indenture. S-8CERTAIN UNITED STATES FEDERAL INCOME AND ESTATE TAX CONSEQUENCES TO NON-U.S. HOLDERS The following is a summary of certain United States federal income and estate tax consequences of the purchase  ownership and disposition of the Senior Notes as of the date hereof. This summary deals only with Senior Notes that are held as capital assets by a non-U.S. holder (as defined below) who acquires the Senior Notes upon original issuance at their initial offering price. A ""non-U.S. holder"" means a beneficial owner of the Senior Notes (other than an entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes) that is not  for United States federal income tax purposes  any of the following: an individual citizen or resident of the United States;a corporation (or any other entity treated as a corporation for United States federal income tax purposes) created or organized in or under the laws of the United States  any state thereof or the District of Columbia;an estate the income of which is subject to United States federal income taxation regardless of its source; ora trust if it (1) is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the United States and one or more United States persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or (2) has a valid election in effect under applicable United States Treasury regulations to be treated as a United States person. This summary is based upon provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986  as amended (the ""Code"")  and regulations  rulings and judicial decisions as of the date hereof. Those authorities may be changed  perhaps retroactively  so as to result in United States federal income and estate tax consequences different from those summarized below. This summary does not address all aspects of United States federal income and estate taxes and does not deal with foreign  state  local or other tax considerations that may be relevant to non-U.S. holders in light of their personal circumstances. In addition  it does not represent a detailed description of the United States federal income and estate tax consequences applicable to you if you are subject to special treatment under the United States federal income tax laws (including if you are a United States expatriate  ""controlled foreign corporation "" ""passive foreign investment company"" or a partnership or other pass-through entity for United States federal income tax purposes). We cannot assure you that a change in law will not alter significantly the tax considerations that we describe in this summary. If a partnership (or other entity or arrangement treated as a partnership for United States federal income tax purposes) holds the Senior Notes  the tax treatment of a partner will generally depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership. If you are a partner of a partnership holding the Senior Notes  you should consult your tax advisors. It is anticipated  and this discussion assumes  that the Senior Notes will not be issued with more than a de minimis amount of original issue discount for United States federal income tax purposes. If you are considering the purchase of Senior Notes  you should consult your own tax advisors concerning the particular United States federal income and estate tax consequences to you of the purchase  ownership and disposition of the Senior Notes  as well as the consequences to you arising under other United States federal tax laws and the laws of any other taxing jurisdiction.

He has over 30 years’ experience in debt and equity capital markets and is a respected figure in the global business community.He is also a director of several private and public companies in both executive and non-executive roles  and devotes much of his time to non-profit activities in education and healthcare.Mr Mehra joins Zumo at a pivotal time for the digital assets sector.In January  the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) gave approval to Bitcoin spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in a watershed moment for the nascent industry. Market watchers and crypto enthusiasts alike believe the billions of dollars flowing into the new ETFs will push crypto into the mainstream.And in March  the London Stock Exchange said it will start accepting applications for the admission of exchange-traded notes (ETNs) backed by Bitcoin and Ether  opening another avenue for professional investors to invest in the asset class.Nick Jones  Founder and CEO  Zumo said:“I’m excited to welcome Ashwath to the Zumo team at a real inflection point for our industry. He has a wealth of experience and a deep skill set that will help us strengthen our governance structures and capitalise on our regulatory advantage. It’s shaping up to be a huge year for the company and having Ashwath on the board is a timely boost.”Ashwath Mehra  Non-Executive Director  Zumo added:“Institutional interest in digital assets is surging as a result of recent developments and Zumo is well-positioned to play a pivotal role.”“I’ve been extremely impressed by the Zumo team’s passion  integrity and commitment to driving a sustainable  compliant digital assets sector that enables financial institutions to protect their customers whilst helping them to explore the new possibilities on offer.”Mr Mehra is the latest addition to Zumo’s board  which includes Andy Downes  who is well known for bringing game-changing payment solutions to the market and has decades of experience in banking and fintech.Zumo is a digital-asset-as-a-service platform  and the market’s only full-stack infrastructure. It enables financial institutions to launch digital asset propositions engineered with a focus on compliance and sustainability. The company’s Crypto Invest solution allows enterprise clients to enable integrated functionality to buy  sell and hold digital assets within their existing platforms.Last year  Zumo launched Oxygen  the first of its kind - a full solution for financial institutions to measure  mitigate and report on the carbon footprint of digital currencies in line with evolving regulations and investor expectations. Zumo then helped Jacobi Asset Management to deliver Europe’s first decarbonised Bitcoin spot ETF  listed on Euronext Amsterdam. The asset management firm selected Oxygen to provide its institutional investors with a Bitcoin exposure aligned with ESG principles.Zumo was also the first digital asset platform to integrate the tech-based requirements of the FCA’s new financial promotions regime for cryptoassets  underscoring its unwavering commitment to setting the highest standards in regulatory alignment and consumer protections.,neutral,0.02,0.92,0.06,positive,0.81,0.18,0.01,True,English,"['Ashwath Mehra', 'executive director', 'Zumo', 'first decarbonised Bitcoin spot ETF', 'sustainable, compliant digital assets sector', 'new financial promotions regime', 'B2B digital assets infrastructure', 'first digital asset platform', 'equity capital markets', 'deep skill set', 'game-changing payment solutions', 'Jacobi Asset Management', 'asset management firm', 'digital asset propositions', 'global business community', 'London Stock Exchange', 'real inflection point', 'Crypto Invest solution', 'service platform', 'full-stack infrastructure', 'digital currencies', 'asset class', 'new possibilities', 'advisory business', 'real estate', 'Exchange Commission', 'financial institutions', 'full solution', 'Bitcoin exposure', 'new ETFs', 'Mr Mehra', 'ASTOR Group', 'private investment', 'several private', 'public companies', 'non-executive roles', 'non-profit activities', 'US Securities', 'exchange-traded funds', 'watershed moment', 'crypto enthusiasts', 'exchange-traded notes', 'professional investors', 'Nick Jones', 'governance structures', 'regulatory advantage', 'huge year', 'timely boost', 'Institutional interest', 'recent developments', 'pivotal role', 'latest addition', 'Andy Downes', 'enterprise clients', 'integrated functionality', 'existing platforms', 'carbon footprint', 'evolving regulations', 'investor expectations', 'Euronext Amsterdam', 'institutional investors', 'ESG principles', 'tech-based requirements', 'highest standards', 'regulatory alignment', 'consumer protections', 'Non-Executive Director', 'Ashwath Mehra', 'pivotal time', 'nascent industry', 'unwavering commitment', '30 years’ experience', 'Market watchers', 'Zumo team', 'Zumo Zumo', 'Source', 'compliance', 'sustainability', 'appointment', 'economist', 'training', 'CEO', 'mining', 'technology', 'biotech', 'debt', 'figure', 'education', 'healthcare', 'January', 'approval', 'billions', 'dollars', 'mainstream', 'March', 'applications', 'admission', 'ETNs', 'Ether', 'avenue', 'Founder', 'wealth', 'company', 'board', 'result', 'passion', 'integrity', 'customers', 'offer', 'decades', 'banking', 'fintech', 'focus', 'Oxygen', 'kind', 'line', 'Europe', 'FCA', 'cryptoassets']",2024-03-12,2024-03-13,finextra.com

Amersfoort  The Netherlands - 12 March 2024 Reference is made to the announcement by Envipco Holding N.V. (""Envipco"" or the ""Company"") earlier today regarding a contemplated private placement (the ""Offering""). The Company is pleased to announce that it has raised NOK 300 million in gross proceeds through the Offering  which received strong interest from both existing shareholders and new institutional investors. Pursuant to the Offering  6 000 000 new ordinary shares in the Company (the ""Offer Shares"") will be issued at a price per Offer Share of NOK 50 (the ""Offer Price""). The Company continues to deliver on its European growth strategy and is well positioned to win target share of new market opportunities. Hence  the Company intends to use the net proceeds from the Private Placement to (i) strengthen the Company's footprint to capitalize on new market opportunities  (ii) working capital  (iii) M&A  and (iv) general corporate purposes. The Board has resolved to initiate an up-listing to Oslo Børs (the main list on the Oslo Stock Exchange) and aim to complete such listing within the next 12 months. The Company's shares are listed on Euronext Amsterdam and Euronext Growth Oslo  under the ticker ENVI and ENVIP  respectively. The shares issued and delivered in the Offering will be included and registered in Euroclear Netherlands  but transferred and registered in the Norwegian Central Securities Depository (the ""VPS"") and will not be tradable on Euronext Amsterdam unless subject to a registration process through Euroclear Netherlands  the central security depositary in the Netherlands. The allocated Offer Shares are expected to be settled through a delivery versus payment transaction by delivery of existing and unencumbered shares in the Company that are already listed pursuant to a share lending agreement entered into between Carnegie AS and Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB (publ) (the ""Managers"")  the Company  Mr. Gregory Garvey and Gregory Garvey Family Investments LLC (an entity controlled by Mr. Garvey)  which shares are included and registered in Euroclear Netherlands  the central security depository in the Netherlands  but will be transferred and registered in the VPS. First day of trading in the allocated shares in the Private Placement on Euronext Growth Oslo is expected on 13 March 2024. Further settlement details will be communicated by the Manager.The Board has considered the structure of the contemplated capital raise in light of the equal treatment obligations under the rules on equal treatment of Oslo Rule Book II for companies listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange and the Oslo Stock Exchange's guidelines on the rule of equal treatment  and is of the opinion that the proposed Offering is in compliance with these requirements. By structuring the transaction as a private placement  the Company was in a position to raise capital in an efficient manner  with a lower discount to the current trading price and with significantly lower completion risks compared to a rights issue. In addition  the Offering was subject to marketing through a publicly announced bookbuilding process and a market- based offer price should therefore be achieved. On this basis and based on an assessment of the current equity markets  the Board has considered the Offering to be in the common interest of the Company and its shareholders. On the basis of the above and taking into consideration that the Offer Price represents a limited discount compared to the recent trading price and a premium to the trading price of the Company over the past months  the Board has resolved not to conduct a subsequent offering directed towards shareholders who did not participate in the Offering. Advisers Carnegie AS and Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken AB (publ) have jointly been retained as Bookrunners and Managers in connection with the Offering. Advokatfirmaet Thommessen AS is acting as the Company's Norwegian legal advisor and Bird & Bird (Netherlands) LLP is acting as the Company's Dutch legal advisor.

It covers both the research and development (R&D) and industrial production phases of the p-SiC® manufacturing process.These substrates will be manufactured at Mersen's production plant in Gennevilliers (France) where Mersen plans to invest about €85 million between 2023 and 2025 and hire between 80 and 100 employees. This agreement is already considered as part of Mersen's 2027 strategic plan  announced in March 2023. This will enable the Group to reach a potential manufacturing capacity of 400 000 wafers (150mm equivalent) by 2027.p-SiC® is a low-resistivity polycrystalline silicon carbide substrate. Combined with a monocrystalline silicon carbide active layer  it is used by manufacturers of SiC power semiconductors to improve production yields and transistor performance  leading to a smaller carbon footprint for the device.This positions Mersen as a major supplier of Soitec's new technology  as part of the strategic partnership signed between the two companies in 2021 to develop a new family of substrates for the electric vehicle market.Luc Themelin  Mersen's Chief Executive Officer  commented: ""We are delighted to benefit from this funding  which illustrates the importance of Mersen in the French semiconductor value chain ecosystem. Thanks to its expertise in advanced materials  the Group is a key player in the manufacturing of silicon carbide semiconductors  one of the Group's key growth drivers for its 2027 roadmap.""[Link]---Mersen is a global expert in electrical power and advanced materials for high-tech industries.

Student Challenge. Aimed at university students worldwide  this innovation competition continues to evolve  with an additional challenge dedicated to China this year  offering an unparalleled experience with significant value for the younger generation.As a world-leading hospitality Group  our Talent culture is centered around nurturing and empowering nearly 300 000 employees working within the Accor network across more than 5 500 hotels in 110 countries and spanning 45 brands from ultra-luxury to economy.

To enhance participants’ preparation and experience  the 2024 edition introduces two exciting initiatives. Firstly  all participating students will be invited to a kickoff session with the competition sponsors - ibis  followed by an interactive Q&A session. This initiative aims to provide participants with comprehensive context and information on the competition’s theme and objectives  ensuring they are well-equipped to embark on their journey with clarity and confidence. Additionally  selected contestants on the design thinking shortlists will benefit from exclusive coaching sessions with external experts and access to a variety of learning resources.As in previous years  participants can anticipate a multitude of benefits during the competition  including the chance to create connections with peers and industry experts worldwide. They will gain priority access to job opportunities within the Accor Group  facilitated by direct connections with HR teams. Through hands-on experience addressing real-world business challenges  participants will undergo significant professional development  complemented by Accor’s support such as coaching  mentoring  and access to learning resources. Furthermore  winners will enjoy an exclusive trip to Paris  where they will have the unique opportunity to meet Group management members  showcase their projects to the board of sponsors  and partake in a tailored program blending city exploration with professional activities.A significant addition this year will be the launch of a pilot challenge exclusively in China. As a long-term supporter of the TakeOff! Challenge and a participant country in past editions  China now hosts this exclusive pilot initiative. Aimed at younger Chinese students from diverse backgrounds  particularly those with limited academic experience  it invites them to propose solutions to operational hotel subjects. Students will have the chance to meet the Accor teams  visit the hotels  and explore various job roles. This presents a unique opportunity for early career exploration and the promotion of the hospitality profession on a national scale. The pilot program debuting in China aims to pave the way for future international expansion in the coming years.Launched 12 years ago  the TakeOff! Student Challenge stands as a symbol of opportunity and innovation within the industry. To date  the competition has engaged more than 6 000 students from various backgrounds across more than 40 countries.

The numbers highlighted reflect the positive trend of the business; in particular: the consolidated Value of Production is equal to EUR 13.2 million  +22% compared to 2022 (EUR 10.9 million)is equal to EUR 13.2 million  +22% compared to 2022 (EUR 10.9 million) proprietary software products   also offered in SaaS (Software as a Service) mode on cloud platform  totalled a +100% increase  reaching Euro 3.2 million  also offered in SaaS (Software as a Service) mode on cloud platform  totalled a +100% increase  reaching Euro 3.2 million Milos® Federative Services posted a +270% increase  reaching Euro 0.8 millionposted a +270% increase  reaching Euro 0.8 million Value of Production of Circle S.p.A. is equal to EUR 6.5 million  +25% compared to 2022 (EUR 5.1 million). The percentage increase in the Value of Production during 2023 was remarkable  as was that - always more than proportional - of proprietary software products and of Milos® Federative Services. The growth of Value of Production could have exceeded even the original expectations; however  it has been affected by the replanning  both in Portugal and in Italy  of nearly all PNRR funds  postponed to 2024. In Italy the funds tied to the ports are inserted inside of the ""MIT call"" expired on November 30th  2023  and consolidated last March  confirmed inthe acts defined on December 29th  2023 (that will have effects starting from the 2024 second quarter) and inside of ""Interporti call"" published last February. It is therefore clear that the related activities were postponed to the period following the first quarter of 2024 and until mid-2026. In Portugal  a similar path postponed them to the period following the first half of 2024. Compared to the analysis of the 2023 preliminary data  the management considers that  despite the effects on the Value of Production resulting from the transfer commented above  the income statement margins are in line with best expectations  thanks to the efficiency brought to the project activities  to increased synergies between companies of the Group  and to acceleration and use of new products and federative services  leaving substantial and increased opportunities on 2024 and 2025. Luca Abatello  President & CEO at CIRCLE  comments on the results achieved: ""Although articulated  2023 was a year of great satisfaction for CIRCLE. The Group's growth has continued along the two main lines of development of proprietary software products and innovative projects; moreover  a fundamental contribution has been made by Milos Federative Services  which represent the basis of the Connect for Agile Growth roadmap and industrial plan.

This is the seventh year that MaaT Pharma's abstracts have been chosen for presentation at the EBMT Annual Meeting  confirming the Company’s leadership in the field of hemato-oncology/ microbiome.Regulatory News:MaaT Pharma (EURONEXT: MAAT – the “Company”)  a clinical-stage biotechnology company and a leader in the development of Microbiome Ecosystem TherapiesTM (MET) dedicated to enhancing survival for patients with cancer  will present extended results from its Early Access Program for patients with aGvHD that were treated with MaaT013 and  for the first time  Overall Survival data after 12 months in more patients. The data will be shared during an oral presentation at the 50th Annual Meeting of the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation held in Glasgow  UK  from April 14-17  2024. Details from the presentation will be disclosed in a press release on April 17th  2024  in compliance with the conference embargo policy.Aligned with its mission to enhance the survival of cancer patients  MaaT Pharma has been actively involved in the EAP in Europe since 2019. The Company has consistently presented real-world data from its EAP at major hematology conferences over the past four years. At each data communication point  EAP results confirm previous findings  that MaaT013 has an impact on overall survival (OS) when the primary endpoint (gastrointestinal Overall Response Rate at D28) is achieved (see press release on data presented at 2023 ASH[1] annual meeting). To date  over 220 patients have been treated with MaaT013 in Europe in clinical trials and the EAP.In the context of the EAP  the Company has bolstered its manufacturing & supply chain  ensuring timely and safe provision of MaaT013 to 38 stem cell transplant hospitals across 6 European countries: Austria  Belgium  France  Germany  Italy  and Spain.Dr. Michael Loschi  hematologist at Nice Hospital in France emphasized “we are enrolling in the EAP due to the lack of third-line treatment options for patients with aGvHD who are unresponsive to corticosteroids and ruxolitinib. We receive MaaT013 within 48 hours following the request via a simple procedure for EAP. This has transformed our routine to treating patients with aGvHD and significantly improved their quality of life. The data presented at ASH align with our observations in clinical practice. We've observed superior efficacy with more complete responses[2] in gastrointestinal aGvHD and less toxicity when compared to other immune suppressive drugs.""“I find the procedure in EAP to be quite straightforward” shared Dr. Alexander Schauwvlieghe  hematologist at AZ Sint-Jan Brugge AV Hospital in Belgium. “I'm a strong advocate for gut microbiome-based treatments  such as MaaT013  that prioritize immune restoration in GvHD. This approach helps maintain the patient's immune function  reducing the risk of infectious complications and relapse.”A pivotal Phase 3 trial (n=75) evaluating MaaT013 (ARES trial - NCT04769895) in patients with corticosteroid and ruxolitinib-refractory gastrointestinal aGvHD is currently ongoing to confirm the results from the EAP. The Company previously shared the positive review by DSMB[3] for the Phase 3 ARES trial  including a favorable benefit/risk ratio  with “high efficacy and low toxicity.”Details of Oral Presentation at EBMT 2024Title: Pooled Fecal Allogenic Microbiotherapy for Refractory Gastrointestinal Acute Graft-Versus-Host Disease: Results from Early Access Program in EuropeAbstract number: OS13-07Session: OS13 Oral Session 13 | GVHDSession Date/Time: Wednesday  April 17  10:30 – 11:45Location: Hall 5About MaaT PharmaMaaT Pharma  a leading clinical-stage biotechnology company  has established a complete approach to restoring patient-microbiome symbiosis in oncology.

Furthermore  in view of the forthcoming change of control  the Group is not publishing a new 2024 outlook. The Consortium's business plan Consortium was communicated to the market on 21 December 2023 and appended to the Accelerated Safeguard Plan. It takes into account the Group's refocusing on Monoprix  Franprix  convenience stores and Cdiscount  and aims to improve the Group's profitability through: (i) adopting a policy of permanent low prices  improving the customer experience and service quality  increasing the visibility and attractiveness of the banners  enriching the assortment and setting up partnerships  increasing the singularity of the banners  boosting growth via franchising and the conversion of directly-operated stores  and accelerating Cdiscount's transition to a marketplace model. In 2024  the Consortium targets a positive EBITDA (after rentals) of 126 million euros  net capital expenditure of -354 million euros and operating cash flow before disposals of -655 million  taking into account the normalization of WCR. In the medium term  the Consortium's business plan shows a gradual improvement in the Group's profitability  driven by the implementation of the above-mentioned operating levers and the implementation of an investment plan of almost -1.6 billion euros over the plan's duration  notably with a view to renovating the store base. By the end of the plan in 2028  EBITDA adjusted (after rentals) should improve significantly to 920 million euros  while other operating items and expenses should stabilize at around -50 million euros. As a result  the Consortium forecasts operating cash flow before disposals of 443 million euros  higher than the annual interest expense of around -230 million euros. Finally  net financial debt at the end of this plan would amount to 1 960 million euros  representing a financial leverage of 2.1x.2.3 - What are the issuer's specific risks?An investment in the Company's securities involves numerous risks and uncertainties related to the Group's activities that could result in a partial or total loss of the investment for investors. The main risks  which the Group considers to be the most significant in terms of their potential impact and probability of occurrence  are as follows: Competitive intensity (very significant risk) : The Group operates in highly competitive markets  particularly in France. In e-commerce  the Group  and in particular Cdiscount  faces competition from international players  notably American. Competition is generally focused on outlet location  product quality  service  price (exacerbated by the inflationary context)  product diversity  brand reputation and store condition. In addition  the Group's ability to adapt its business models to customer expectations is a major challenge. Business disruption/interruption (very significant risk) : Risk of business disruption/interruption within the Group  this encompasses the risks of supply disruption  inaccessibility of sites  and destruction/damage to buildings. Supply chain’s efficiency and smooth running are essential. Changes in the Group's logistical structures may lead to an interruption of operations  store shortages and disruption to inventory management. Catastrophic events and other types of events could have a negative effect on the Group's business. The Paris Olympic and Paralympic Games (JOP) are likely to disrupt store operations in the Île-de-France region and at regional competition venues. Franchising risks (very significant risk) : Operating stores under franchise has been one of the Group's development strategies. In France  by the end of 2023  79% of our stores will be operated under franchise or lease management  and in particular 90% of the Casino proximity network. Excluding HM/SM  83% of the Group's store base is operated under franchise or lease management. The Group aims to accelerate its expansion in the convenience sector by 2024  relying primarily on franchising. In view of the sale of the hypermarkets and supermarkets division and the franchise development plan  the proportion of stores operated under franchise or lease management is set to rise to 90% over the next few years. This form of development has the advantage of significantly reducing the investments required to develop the store network  since these are largely borne by the franchisees. However  it also presents risks for the franchisor  the main ones being: (i) image  (ii) poorly controlled development  (iii) financial  (iv) legal and (v) competitive and administrative risks. Risks relating to information systems and cybercrime (very significant risk) : The Group operates a large network of information systems that are essential to the performance and management of its activities. The development  implementation and continuous  uninterrupted operation of these information systems are an important element in the ability to deliver products and services to customers for all the Group's banners  in particular for Cdiscount's operations  as well as for the digital advertising and data center businesses  RelevanC and ScaleMax. These risks also affect stores and warehouses  via critical information systems. International tensions in Eastern Europe and the Middle East  as well as the organization of the Olympic Games in France in 2024  could lead to an upsurge in cyber-attacks on French companies. Risks linked to the economic context (very significant risk) : The Group's business  and in particular its sales  operating income and cash flow generated  are strongly correlated with consumer spending. This spending is affected by economic cycles. In particular  inflation could continue to have an impact on purchasing power  consumption patterns and consumer spending. Current international tensions could continue to drive up the cost of raw materials. Latin American economies have historically been subject to sharp variations in their level of activity. In addition  the Group could be adversely affected by exchange rate movements (rise in the dollar against the euro). What's more  the Group's activities will be mainly concentrated in France following completion of the plan to sell off its South American entities  which makes it vulnerable to France's specific economic context. In France  in Q3 2023  (i) the unemployment rate will rise again  and (ii) INSEE has measured a downward trend in household purchasing power. Liquidity (very significant risk) : In the absence of completion of the Financial Restructuring  the Company would not be in a position to meet its future obligations over the next twelve months  and its ability to continue as a going concern would therefore be compromised. Such situation could lead to the opening of receivership or compulsory winding-up proceedings  which could lead to the sale of all or part of the Company's assets  and could place (i) shareholders in the position of losing their entire investment in the Company  and (ii) creditors in the situation of reduced prospects of recovering their receivables. At 31 December 2023  the Group's cash position amounted to 1 051 million euros. Increased by the cash generated by the disposal of the Éxito group in January 2024 for a net amount of 357 million euros  the Group covers its liquidity needs for the 1st quarter of 2024  estimated at 600 million euros. Risks relating to compliance with laws and regulations (very significant risk) : With a particularly extensive supply chain  and given the nature of the Group's activities and its international presence  the Group is exposed to the risk of legal action  particularly in respect of the Sapin II law pertaining to the fight against corruption  the law relating to the duty of care of parent companies and principals and non-compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (RGPD). The protection of data concerning the Group's customers and employees is also a major issue to which the Group pays particular attention. Exposure to this risk is heightened by the development of e-commerce activities and the increasing digitization of data media. Both in France and abroad  the Group is subject to all legislation and regulations governing the operation of establishments open to the public.Section 3 - Key information on securities3.1 - What are

According to the indicative timetable  the New Shares issued in connection with the Reserved Share Capital Increases will be admitted to trading on this market as from 27 March 2024. They will be immediately assimilated to the existing shares already traded on Euronext Paris and will be tradable  as from this date  on the same trading line under ISIN Code FR0000125585. The Warrants #1 and the Warrants #3 will be tradable on Euronext Paris from their Issue Date respectively  under ISIN Codes FR001400OJ72 and ISIN FR001400OJ98 respectively. No application for admission to trading on another regulated market has been or will be made. The Warrants #2 and the Warrants Additional Shares will not be the subject of an application for admission to trading on any regulated or unregulated market. They will be freely tradable and will be the subject of a request for admission to trading by Euroclear France  which will ensure their clearing between account holders-custodians. The Warrants constitute securities giving access to the share capital within the meaning of articles L. 228-91 et seq. of the French Commercial Code. No application has been made or is contemplated to be made by the Company for them to be admitted to trading on another market (regulated or not). The New Shares resulting from the exercise of the Warrants will be subject to periodic requests for admission to trading on Euronext Paris and will be tradable on the same trading line as the existing Shares.3.3 - Are securities covered by a guarantee?The Reserved Share Capital Increases are not secured by a bank syndicate or underwriting agreement. They are subscribed under the Accelerated Safeguard Plan. Similarly  the issue of Warrants is underwritten by application of the Accelerated Safeguard Plan. These commitments do not constitute a performance guarantee (garantie de bonne fin) within the meaning of Article L. 225-145 of the French Commercial Code.3.4 - What are the main risks specific to securities?The main risk factors relating to the New Shares (including those issued upon exercise of the Warrants) and the Warrants are set out below. The Group has assessed the significance of the specific risks to which it believes it is exposed on the basis of the likelihood of their materialization and the estimated magnitude of their negative impact after taking into account the action plans in place. The most significant risk factors according to the above assessment are indicated first and marked with an asterisk. Existing Casino shareholders will suffer significant dilution of their interest in the Company's share capital as a result of the completion of the Issuances and the exercise of the Warrants *: The implementation of the Issuances should be completed by the end of the first quarter 2024 and the exercise of the Warrants contemplated under the financial restructuring plan will result in significant dilution for existing Casino shareholders. As an indication  a shareholder holding 1% of the Company's share capital would see his shareholding decrease (on a diluted basis)  post completion of the Reserved Share Capital Increases  to 0.003% of the Company's share capital and 0.003% post exercise of all the Warrants. In view of the very large number of Shares and Warrants issued in connection with the Issuances  sales of a significant number of Shares or Warrants could occur rapidly from the date of completion of the Issuances  or such sales could be anticipated by the market  which could have an unfavorable impact on the market price of the Shares and/or the market price of the Warrants *: The completion of the Issuances and the exercise of the Warrants would lead to the issuance of a significant number of Shares and to a significant change in the shareholder structure. Sales of a significant number of the Shares or Warrants could occur rapidly from the completion date of the Issuances  or such sales could be anticipated by the market given the absence of a lock-up commitment for some beneficiaries of the Reserved Share Capital Increases  which could have an unfavorable impact on the market price of the Share and/or of each category of Warrants. It is therefore highly likely that the post-Warrants issue and exercise share price will be close to the issue price of the Reserved Share Capital Increases and the exercise of the Warrants  thus having a lasting impact on the company's share price and the group’s capital market financing. Volatility and liquidity of the Shares and Warrants may fluctuate significantly *: Stock markets have experienced significant fluctuations unrelated to the results of the concerned companies  which could increase the volatility of the Shares  cumulated to their low unit value prior completion of the Reverse Share Split. The liquidity of the market for the Shares could be reduced as a result of the capital ownership structure on completion of the Financial Restructuring transactions. No assurance can be given that a market will develop for the Warrants #1 and the Warrants #3 on Euronext Paris and  if it does develop  it may offer only limited liquidity and be subject to high volatility. Holders of the Warrants #1 and the Warrants #3  as the case may be  who do not wish to exercise them may not be able to sell them on the market. The market price of the said Warrants #1 and the Warrants #3 will depend in particular on the market price of the Shares and  in the event of a decline in the market price of the Shares  the value of these Warrants could decrease. In addition  trades between institutional investors involving large quantities are generally executed off-market. Consequently  not all investors may have access to this type of transaction and  in particular  to their pricing conditions. The market price of the Shares could fluctuate and fall below the subscription price of the New Shares issued upon exercise of the Warrants  and if this fall were to occur after the exercise of the Warrants by their holders  the latter would suffer a loss in the event of immediate sale of the said New Shares* : No assurance can be given that  during the Exercise Period of the Warrants  the market price of the shares will be higher than or equal to the exercise price of the Warrants nor  consequently  that the Warrant Holders will be able to acquire additional shares in the Company's share capital at an attractive price. If the share price were to fall after the exercise of the Warrants by their holders  the latter would suffer a loss in the event of immediate sale of the Shares received. Thus  no assurance can be given that  subsequent to the exercise of the Warrants  investors will be able to sell their Shares at a price equal to or greater than the exercise price of the Warrants. Risk of lapsing and loss of value of the Warrants : Warrants that have not been exercised by the expiry date of their Exercise Period will lapse and lose all value and rights attached thereto. The terms and conditions of each category of Warrants may be modified and such modifications would be binding on all their respective holders : The terms and conditions of each category of Warrants may be modified  subject to the authorization of a special meeting of the holders of each of the categories of warrants concerned  deciding  in accordance with current regulations  by a two-thirds majority of the votes of the holders present or represented at said meeting. Any amendment so approved will be binding upon all Holders of Warrants #1  Holders of Warrants #2  Holders of Warrants #3 or Holders of Warrants Additional Shares  as the case may be. The terms and conditions of each category of Warrants are based on the laws and regulations in force at the date of this document. Legislative or regulatory developments could have the effect of modifying the terms and conditions of each category of Warrants  which could have an impact on their value. No assurance can be given as to the impact of such potential changes after the date of this document. The holders of each category of Warrants benefit from limited anti-dilution protection : The exercise ratio of each category of Warrants will be adjusted in the only cases provided for by their terms and conditions of said Warrants and in accordance with the provisions of the French Commercial Code. Accordingly  the exercise ratio of each category of Warrants will not necessarily be adjusted in all cases where an event relating to the Company or any other event is likely to affect the value of the Shares or  more generally  to have a dilutive impact. Events for which no adjustment is foreseen could have a negative impact on the value of the Shares and  consequently  on that of the Warrants.Section 4 - Key information on admission to trading on a regulated market for securities4.1 - Under what conditions and according to what timetable can I invest in this security?Conditions to the transaction: The approval of the Accelerated Safeguard Plan by the class of shareholders of the Company  meeting as a class of affected parties on 11 January 2024  entailed approval by the class of shareholders of all the resolutions included in the appendix to the Accelerated Safeguard Plan  delegating powers to the Company's Board of Directors  notably for the purpose of carrying out the Issuances.Reserved Share Capital Increases: The Reserved Share Capital Increases will be carried out through the waiver of the shareholders’ preferential subscription rights in favor of beneficiaries mentioned in section 3.1.1 of this Summary.

The impact of the restructuring on control of the Company is more fully described in section 2 of the URD. A shareholders’ agreement would be entered into between the shareholders of France Retail Holdings. On 9 January 2024  the AMF granted an exemption from the obligation for the members of the Consortium acting in concert and their investment vehicle (France Retail Holdings) to file a draft public offer for Casino shares.Estimated expenses related to the Reserved Share Capital Increase and the Warrants issues: For information purposes  all expenses related to the restructuring (including expenses related to the Reserved Share Capital Increases and the Warrants issues) are currently estimated at an amount of approximately 125 million euros  of which 40 million euros were paid at 31 December 2023. In addition  the Unsecured Creditors and the Perpetual Creditors having acceded to the Lock-up Agreement at the latest on the Last Accession Date will benefit from a specific support fee on the Effective Restructuring Date (for a total amount of approximately 6 8 million euros). It is specified that the expenses relating to the Reserved Share Capital Increases and the issuance of the Warrants will be financed exclusively from the Group's available cash and the setting up of new financing lines.Expenses billed to the investor by the Company: Not applicable4.2 - Why is this prospectus being prepared?This Prospectus has been prepared in connection with the admission of the New Shares and Warrants #1 and Warrants #3 to trading on Euronext Paris. The information contained in this Prospectus allows to restore  in all material respects and as far as necessary  equal access between the various shareholders and investors to information relating to the Company. It is reminded that the Issuances will result from the implementation of the Accelerated Safeguard Plan. With the exception of the Reverse Share Split and Share Capital Reduction No. 2  all transactions provided for in the Accelerated Safeguard Plan  form an indissociable whole  so that if one of the transactions were not to be carried out  none of them would be implemented. The Accelerated Safeguard Plan is expected to be implemented by 30 April 2024 at the latest  or such other date as may be determined in accordance with the Accelerated Safeguard Plan and the Lock-up Agreement.Reason for Issuances and use of proceeds: Context of Issuances: Fiscal year 2022 and the first semester 2023 were characterized by high inflation in food prices  leading the Group to face a decline in sales in its HM/SM due to losses in market share as a result of a pricing policy superior to that of its competitors. Furthermore  operating cash flow generation in France before implementation of the asset disposal plan for 2022 was negative at 524m euros. In this context  on 5 October 2023  the Group entered into a lock-up agreement (the ""Lock-up Agreement"") relating to its Financial Restructuring  with  on the one hand  EP Equity Investment  an entity controlled by Mr. Daniel Křetínský  Fimalac and Attestor and  on the other hand  creditors economically holding 75% of the TLB  major commercial banking groups and certain of the aforementioned creditors economically holding 92% of the RCF  as well as holders of the HY Quatrim Bonds representing 58% of these bonds. On 25 October 2023  the Paris Commercial Court opened accelerated safeguard proceedings in respect of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries (Casino Finance  DCF  CPF  Quatrim  Ségisor and Monoprix) for an period of 2 months  renewed for a further 2 months. Casino's Accelerated Safeguard Plan and those of the said subsidiaries incorporate the restructuring terms agreed in the Lock-up Agreement. Their main objectives are as follows: (i) a share capital increase of 1.2bn euros  (ii) a capital conversion of 3.5bn euros excluding Perpetual Claims  (iii) the refinancing of 2.6bn euros of debt and (iv) the maintenance of operational financing of 1.2 billion euros.Consolidated net working capital : As of the date of approval of this Prospectus  and prior to the implementation of the Accelerated Safeguard Plan for its benefit (and for the benefit of certain of its subsidiaries)  the Company does not have sufficient consolidated net working capital to meet its future obligations over the next twelve months. In the absence of the completion of the Financial Restructuring  the Company estimates that approximately 7.4 billion euros will be required to cover its liquidity needs  from 1st April 2024  over the next 12 months (i.e. until the end of March 2025). Measures planned as part of the conciliation and accelerated safeguard proceedings ensure that the Company has sufficient cash to finance its up to the effective completion of the Financial Restructuring  expected at the end of March 2024  allowing the Group to cover its liquidity needs for the 1st quarter of 2024  estimated at around 600 million euros. The completion by the end of March 2024 of the Financial Restructuring will meet the Group's estimated liquidity needs until the end of March 2025  in accordance with the accelerated safeguard plan approved by the Paris Commercial Court on 26 February 2024  and this by taking into account the impact of the disposal of HM/SM assets over the same period under the agreements with Groupement Les Mousquetaires  Auchan Retail and Carrefour. Under these conditions  consolidated net working capital would be sufficient to meet the Company's obligations over the next twelve months from the date of approval of the Prospectus.Governance and restrictions on the transfer of Shares : The completion of the Financial Restructuring of the Group will result in a change of control of the Group to France Retail Holdings S.à.r.l. (an entity ultimately controlled by Mr. Daniel Křetínský) On the date of the Financial Restructuring  Mr. Jean-Charles Naouri will resign from all his functions with immediate effect; as well as all members of Casino Board of Directors  with the exception of Ms Nathalie Andrieux. The overall composition of the Board of Directors will be proposed by the Consortium. It is envisaged that the Company will refer to the AFEP-MEDEF Code recommendations  it being specified that the composition and powers of the audit committee and the Compensation and Appointments Committee will comply with the recommendations of the said Code. The Company will remain listed on Euronext Paris.Expert's report: The Company voluntarily appointed Sorgem Evaluation  located at 11 rue Leroux  75116 Paris  and represented by Mr. Maurice Nussenbaum  as an independent expert  in accordance with article 261-3 of the AMF's general regulations  to give an opinion on the fairness of the terms and conditions of the Company's restructuring from the point of view of current shareholders. The conclusion of this opinion is as follows: ""Under these conditions  we are of the opinion that the financial terms and conditions of the proposed restructuring plan are fair to CASINO's current shareholders"".Use and estimated net amount of proceeds:The funds raised in cash within the framework of the Share Capital Increase Reserved for the Consortium SPV and of the Backstopped Share Capital Increase for an amount of € 1 199 999 999.97 (including issue premium) will be used as follows: (i) up to an amount of 220 million euros for repayment of Group Public Liabilities  (ii) up to an amount of around 260 million euros  to redeem in full (y) the Regera Bonds and (z) other borrowings and financial debt  and to pay accrued and overdue interest and fees in cash (other than those to be converted into equity in connection with the Reserved Share Capital Increases); and (iii) the balance being retained by the Company to meet (x) its financial requirements (including the payment of fees and costs related to the restructuring  in particular  the amount of commissions due to creditors having adhered to the Lock-up Agreement payable on the Effective Restructuring Date and (y) any delay in the redeployment of Casino Group. By way of indication  all the expenses relating to the restructuring (including the expenses relating to the Reserved Capital Increases and the Warrants issuances) are currently estimated at an amount of around 125 million euros  of which 40 million euros had been paid by 31 December 2023.Underwriting agreement with firm commitment: Not applicable.Lock-up Agreement: In accordance with the Lock-up Agreement and subject to certain exceptions  (i) France Retail Holdings undertakes not to sell or transfer the New Shares subscribed for in the Share Capital Increase Reserved for the Consortium SPV for a period of 4 years from the subscription date nor (ii) any share subscribed for in the context of the Backstopped Share Capital Increase by the beneficiaries of the Backstopped Share Capital Increase may not be sold or transferred in any manner whatsoever for a period of 6 months from the subscription date.

Furthermore  in view of the forthcoming change of control  the Group is not publishing a new 2024 outlook. The Consortium's business plan Consortium was communicated to the market on 21 December 2023 and appended to the Accelerated Safeguard Plan. It takes into account the Group's refocusing on Monoprix  Franprix  convenience stores and Cdiscount  and aims to improve the Group's profitability through: (i) adopting a policy of permanent low prices  improving the customer experience and service quality  increasing the visibility and attractiveness of the banners  enriching the assortment and setting up partnerships  increasing the singularity of the banners  boosting growth via franchising and the conversion of directly-operated stores  and accelerating Cdiscount's transition to a marketplace model. In 2024  the Consortium targets a positive EBITDA (after rentals) of 126 million euros  net capital expenditure of -354 million euros and operating cash flow before disposals of -655 million  taking into account the normalization of WCR. In the medium term  the Consortium's business plan shows a gradual improvement in the Group's profitability  driven by the implementation of the above-mentioned operating levers and the implementation of an investment plan of almost -1.6 billion euros over the plan's duration  notably with a view to renovating the store base. By the end of the plan in 2028  EBITDA adjusted (after rentals) should improve significantly to 920 million euros  while other operating items and expenses should stabilize at around -50 million euros. As a result  the Consortium forecasts operating cash flow before disposals of 443 million euros  higher than the annual interest expense of around -230 million euros. Finally  net financial debt at the end of this plan would amount to 1 960 million euros  representing a financial leverage of 2.1x.2.3 - What are the issuer's specific risks?An investment in the Company's securities involves numerous risks and uncertainties related to the Group's activities that could result in a partial or total loss of the investment for investors. The main risks  which the Group considers to be the most significant in terms of their potential impact and probability of occurrence  are as follows: Competitive intensity (very significant risk) : The Group operates in highly competitive markets  particularly in France. In e-commerce  the Group  and in particular Cdiscount  faces competition from international players  notably American. Competition is generally focused on outlet location  product quality  service  price (exacerbated by the inflationary context)  product diversity  brand reputation and store condition. In addition  the Group's ability to adapt its business models to customer expectations is a major challenge. Business disruption/interruption (very significant risk) : Risk of business disruption/interruption within the Group  this encompasses the risks of supply disruption  inaccessibility of sites  and destruction/damage to buildings. Supply chain’s efficiency and smooth running are essential. Changes in the Group's logistical structures may lead to an interruption of operations  store shortages and disruption to inventory management. Catastrophic events and other types of events could have a negative effect on the Group's business. The Paris Olympic and Paralympic Games (JOP) are likely to disrupt store operations in the Île-de-France region and at regional competition venues. Franchising risks (very significant risk) : Operating stores under franchise has been one of the Group's development strategies. In France  by the end of 2023  79% of our stores will be operated under franchise or lease management  and in particular 90% of the Casino proximity network. Excluding HM/SM  83% of the Group's store base is operated under franchise or lease management. The Group aims to accelerate its expansion in the convenience sector by 2024  relying primarily on franchising. In view of the sale of the hypermarkets and supermarkets division and the franchise development plan  the proportion of stores operated under franchise or lease management is set to rise to 90% over the next few years. This form of development has the advantage of significantly reducing the investments required to develop the store network  since these are largely borne by the franchisees. However  it also presents risks for the franchisor  the main ones being: (i) image  (ii) poorly controlled development  (iii) financial  (iv) legal and (v) competitive and administrative risks. Risks relating to information systems and cybercrime (very significant risk) : The Group operates a large network of information systems that are essential to the performance and management of its activities. The development  implementation and continuous  uninterrupted operation of these information systems are an important element in the ability to deliver products and services to customers for all the Group's banners  in particular for Cdiscount's operations  as well as for the digital advertising and data center businesses  RelevanC and ScaleMax. These risks also affect stores and warehouses  via critical information systems. International tensions in Eastern Europe and the Middle East  as well as the organization of the Olympic Games in France in 2024  could lead to an upsurge in cyber-attacks on French companies. Risks linked to the economic context (very significant risk) : The Group's business  and in particular its sales  operating income and cash flow generated  are strongly correlated with consumer spending. This spending is affected by economic cycles. In particular  inflation could continue to have an impact on purchasing power  consumption patterns and consumer spending. Current international tensions could continue to drive up the cost of raw materials. Latin American economies have historically been subject to sharp variations in their level of activity. In addition  the Group could be adversely affected by exchange rate movements (rise in the dollar against the euro). What's more  the Group's activities will be mainly concentrated in France following completion of the plan to sell off its South American entities  which makes it vulnerable to France's specific economic context. In France  in Q3 2023  (i) the unemployment rate will rise again  and (ii) INSEE has measured a downward trend in household purchasing power. Liquidity (very significant risk) : In the absence of completion of the Financial Restructuring  the Company would not be in a position to meet its future obligations over the next twelve months  and its ability to continue as a going concern would therefore be compromised. Such situation could lead to the opening of receivership or compulsory winding-up proceedings  which could lead to the sale of all or part of the Company's assets  and could place (i) shareholders in the position of losing their entire investment in the Company  and (ii) creditors in the situation of reduced prospects of recovering their receivables. At 31 December 2023  the Group's cash position amounted to 1 051 million euros. Increased by the cash generated by the disposal of the Éxito group in January 2024 for a net amount of 357 million euros  the Group covers its liquidity needs for the 1st quarter of 2024  estimated at 600 million euros. Risks relating to compliance with laws and regulations (very significant risk) : With a particularly extensive supply chain  and given the nature of the Group's activities and its international presence  the Group is exposed to the risk of legal action  particularly in respect of the Sapin II law pertaining to the fight against corruption  the law relating to the duty of care of parent companies and principals and non-compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (RGPD). The protection of data concerning the Group's customers and employees is also a major issue to which the Group pays particular attention. Exposure to this risk is heightened by the development of e-commerce activities and the increasing digitization of data media. Both in France and abroad  the Group is subject to all legislation and regulations governing the operation of establishments open to the public.Section 3 - Key information on securities3.1 - What are

The exercise of all Warrant #3 will give right to subscribe for a maximum of 1 082 917 221 New Shares (subject to the adjustments described in the terms and conditions of said Warrant #3)  at an exercise price of 0.1688 euro  paid up in full in cash. The Warrant #3 will be exercisable for a period of 3 years from the 25th month following the Effective Restructuring Date. Warrant which have not been exercised within the aforementioned periods will become null and void and will lose all value and all rights attached thereto. The Warrant Holders are grouped together in a collective group (masse) for each category of Warrants  which shall benefit from legal personality and be subject to the same provisions as those set out in articles L. 228-47 to L. 228-64  L. 228-66 and L. 228-90 of the French Commercial Code.Issue currency: euroDenomination of Warrants: CASINO GP BSA #1 ; CASINO GP BSA #2 ; CASINO GP BSA #3 ; CGP BSA Act AdditionnellesRelative ranking of the securities in the capital structure of the issuer in the event of insolvency: not applicableMaximum number of Warrants: 2 275 702 846 Warrants Additional Shares: 2 111 688 580 Warrants #1: 542 299 348 Warrants #2: and 706 989 066 Warrants #3.Restrictions on the free transferability of the Warrants: no clause of the article of associations limits the free negotiability of the Warrants.3.2 - Where are securities traded?Application will be made for the New Shares (including those issued on exercise of Warrants) to be admitted to trading on Euronext Paris. According to the indicative timetable  the New Shares issued in connection with the Reserved Share Capital Increases will be admitted to trading on this market as from 27 March 2024. They will be immediately assimilated to the existing shares already traded on Euronext Paris and will be tradable  as from this date  on the same trading line under ISIN Code FR0000125585. The Warrants #1 and the Warrants #3 will be tradable on Euronext Paris from their Issue Date respectively  under ISIN Codes FR001400OJ72 and ISIN FR001400OJ98 respectively. No application for admission to trading on another regulated market has been or will be made. The Warrants #2 and the Warrants Additional Shares will not be the subject of an application for admission to trading on any regulated or unregulated market. They will be freely tradable and will be the subject of a request for admission to trading by Euroclear France  which will ensure their clearing between account holders-custodians. The Warrants constitute securities giving access to the share capital within the meaning of articles L. 228-91 et seq. of the French Commercial Code. No application has been made or is contemplated to be made by the Company for them to be admitted to trading on another market (regulated or not). The New Shares resulting from the exercise of the Warrants will be subject to periodic requests for admission to trading on Euronext Paris and will be tradable on the same trading line as the existing Shares.3.3 - Are securities covered by a guarantee?The Reserved Share Capital Increases are not secured by a bank syndicate or underwriting agreement. They are subscribed under the Accelerated Safeguard Plan. Similarly  the issue of Warrants is underwritten by application of the Accelerated Safeguard Plan. These commitments do not constitute a performance guarantee (garantie de bonne fin) within the meaning of Article L. 225-145 of the French Commercial Code.3.4 - What are the main risks specific to securities?The main risk factors relating to the New Shares (including those issued upon exercise of the Warrants) and the Warrants are set out below. The Group has assessed the significance of the specific risks to which it believes it is exposed on the basis of the likelihood of their materialization and the estimated magnitude of their negative impact after taking into account the action plans in place. The most significant risk factors according to the above assessment are indicated first and marked with an asterisk. Existing Casino shareholders will suffer significant dilution of their interest in the Company's share capital as a result of the completion of the Issuances and the exercise of the Warrants *: The implementation of the Issuances should be completed by the end of the first quarter 2024 and the exercise of the Warrants contemplated under the financial restructuring plan will result in significant dilution for existing Casino shareholders. As an indication  a shareholder holding 1% of the Company's share capital would see his shareholding decrease (on a diluted basis)  post completion of the Reserved Share Capital Increases  to 0.003% of the Company's share capital and 0.003% post exercise of all the Warrants. In view of the very large number of Shares and Warrants issued in connection with the Issuances  sales of a significant number of Shares or Warrants could occur rapidly from the date of completion of the Issuances  or such sales could be anticipated by the market  which could have an unfavorable impact on the market price of the Shares and/or the market price of the Warrants *: The completion of the Issuances and the exercise of the Warrants would lead to the issuance of a significant number of Shares and to a significant change in the shareholder structure. Sales of a significant number of the Shares or Warrants could occur rapidly from the completion date of the Issuances  or such sales could be anticipated by the market given the absence of a lock-up commitment for some beneficiaries of the Reserved Share Capital Increases  which could have an unfavorable impact on the market price of the Share and/or of each category of Warrants. It is therefore highly likely that the post-Warrants issue and exercise share price will be close to the issue price of the Reserved Share Capital Increases and the exercise of the Warrants  thus having a lasting impact on the company's share price and the group’s capital market financing. Volatility and liquidity of the Shares and Warrants may fluctuate significantly *: Stock markets have experienced significant fluctuations unrelated to the results of the concerned companies  which could increase the volatility of the Shares  cumulated to their low unit value prior completion of the Reverse Share Split. The liquidity of the market for the Shares could be reduced as a result of the capital ownership structure on completion of the Financial Restructuring transactions. No assurance can be given that a market will develop for the Warrants #1 and the Warrants #3 on Euronext Paris and  if it does develop  it may offer only limited liquidity and be subject to high volatility. Holders of the Warrants #1 and the Warrants #3  as the case may be  who do not wish to exercise them may not be able to sell them on the market. The market price of the said Warrants #1 and the Warrants #3 will depend in particular on the market price of the Shares and  in the event of a decline in the market price of the Shares  the value of these Warrants could decrease. In addition  trades between institutional investors involving large quantities are generally executed off-market. Consequently  not all investors may have access to this type of transaction and  in particular  to their pricing conditions. The market price of the Shares could fluctuate and fall below the subscription price of the New Shares issued upon exercise of the Warrants  and if this fall were to occur after the exercise of the Warrants by their holders  the latter would suffer a loss in the event of immediate sale of the said New Shares* : No assurance can be given that  during the Exercise Period of the Warrants  the market price of the shares will be higher than or equal to the exercise price of the Warrants nor  consequently  that the Warrant Holders will be able to acquire additional shares in the Company's share capital at an attractive price. If the share price were to fall after the exercise of the Warrants by their holders  the latter would suffer a loss in the event of immediate sale of the Shares received. Thus  no assurance can be given that  subsequent to the exercise of the Warrants  investors will be able to sell their Shares at a price equal to or greater than the exercise price of the Warrants. Risk of lapsing and loss of value of the Warrants : Warrants that have not been exercised by the expiry date of their Exercise Period will lapse and lose all value and rights attached thereto. The terms and conditions of each category of Warrants may be modified and such modifications would be binding on all their respective holders : The terms and conditions of each category of Warrants may be modified  subject to the authorization of a special meeting of the holders of each of the categories of warrants concerned  deciding  in accordance with current regulations  by a two-thirds majority of the votes of the holders present or represented at said meeting. Any amendment so approved will be binding upon all Holders of Warrants #1  Holders of Warrants #2  Holders of Warrants #3 or Holders of Warrants Additional Shares  as the case may be. The terms and conditions of each category of Warrants are based on the laws and regulations in force at the date of this document. Legislative or regulatory developments could have the effect of modifying the terms and conditions of each category of Warrants  which could have an impact on their value. No assurance can be given as to the impact of such potential changes after the date of this document. The holders of each category of Warrants benefit from limited anti-dilution protection : The exercise ratio of each category of Warrants will be adjusted in the only cases provided for by their terms and conditions of said Warrants and in accordance with the provisions of the French Commercial Code. Accordingly  the exercise ratio of each category of Warrants will not necessarily be adjusted in all cases where an event relating to the Company or any other event is likely to affect the value of the Shares or  more generally  to have a dilutive impact. Events for which no adjustment is foreseen could have a negative impact on the value of the Shares and  consequently  on that of the Warrants.Section 4 - Key information on admission to trading on a regulated market for securities4.1 - Under what conditions and according to what timetable can I invest in this security?Conditions to the transaction: The approval of the Accelerated Safeguard Plan by the class of shareholders of the Company  meeting as a class of affected parties on 11 January 2024  entailed approval by the class of shareholders of all the resolutions included in the appendix to the Accelerated Safeguard Plan  delegating powers to the Company's Board of Directors  notably for the purpose of carrying out the Issuances.Reserved Share Capital Increases: The Reserved Share Capital Increases will be carried out through the waiver of the shareholders’ preferential subscription rights in favor of beneficiaries mentioned in section 3.1.1 of this Summary.

The impact of the restructuring on control of the Company is more fully described in section 2 of the URD. A shareholders’ agreement would be entered into between the shareholders of France Retail Holdings. On 9 January 2024  the AMF granted an exemption from the obligation for the members of the Consortium acting in concert and their investment vehicle (France Retail Holdings) to file a draft public offer for Casino shares.Estimated expenses related to the Reserved Share Capital Increase and the Warrants issues: For information purposes  all expenses related to the restructuring (including expenses related to the Reserved Share Capital Increases and the Warrants issues) are currently estimated at an amount of approximately 125 million euros  of which 40 million euros were paid at 31 December 2023. In addition  the Unsecured Creditors and the Perpetual Creditors having acceded to the Lock-up Agreement at the latest on the Last Accession Date will benefit from a specific support fee on the Effective Restructuring Date (for a total amount of approximately 6 8 million euros). It is specified that the expenses relating to the Reserved Share Capital Increases and the issuance of the Warrants will be financed exclusively from the Group's available cash and the setting up of new financing lines.Expenses billed to the investor by the Company: Not applicable4.2 - Why is this prospectus being prepared?This Prospectus has been prepared in connection with the admission of the New Shares and Warrants #1 and Warrants #3 to trading on Euronext Paris. The information contained in this Prospectus allows to restore  in all material respects and as far as necessary  equal access between the various shareholders and investors to information relating to the Company. It is reminded that the Issuances will result from the implementation of the Accelerated Safeguard Plan. With the exception of the Reverse Share Split and Share Capital Reduction No. 2  all transactions provided for in the Accelerated Safeguard Plan  form an indissociable whole  so that if one of the transactions were not to be carried out  none of them would be implemented. The Accelerated Safeguard Plan is expected to be implemented by 30 April 2024 at the latest  or such other date as may be determined in accordance with the Accelerated Safeguard Plan and the Lock-up Agreement.Reason for Issuances and use of proceeds: Context of Issuances: Fiscal year 2022 and the first semester 2023 were characterized by high inflation in food prices  leading the Group to face a decline in sales in its HM/SM due to losses in market share as a result of a pricing policy superior to that of its competitors. Furthermore  operating cash flow generation in France before implementation of the asset disposal plan for 2022 was negative at 524m euros. In this context  on 5 October 2023  the Group entered into a lock-up agreement (the ""Lock-up Agreement"") relating to its Financial Restructuring  with  on the one hand  EP Equity Investment  an entity controlled by Mr. Daniel Křetínský  Fimalac and Attestor and  on the other hand  creditors economically holding 75% of the TLB  major commercial banking groups and certain of the aforementioned creditors economically holding 92% of the RCF  as well as holders of the HY Quatrim Bonds representing 58% of these bonds. On 25 October 2023  the Paris Commercial Court opened accelerated safeguard proceedings in respect of the Company and certain of its subsidiaries (Casino Finance  DCF  CPF  Quatrim  Ségisor and Monoprix) for an period of 2 months  renewed for a further 2 months. Casino's Accelerated Safeguard Plan and those of the said subsidiaries incorporate the restructuring terms agreed in the Lock-up Agreement. Their main objectives are as follows: (i) a share capital increase of 1.2bn euros  (ii) a capital conversion of 3.5bn euros excluding Perpetual Claims  (iii) the refinancing of 2.6bn euros of debt and (iv) the maintenance of operational financing of 1.2 billion euros.Consolidated net working capital : As of the date of approval of this Prospectus  and prior to the implementation of the Accelerated Safeguard Plan for its benefit (and for the benefit of certain of its subsidiaries)  the Company does not have sufficient consolidated net working capital to meet its future obligations over the next twelve months. In the absence of the completion of the Financial Restructuring  the Company estimates that approximately 7.4 billion euros will be required to cover its liquidity needs  from 1st April 2024  over the next 12 months (i.e. until the end of March 2025). Measures planned as part of the conciliation and accelerated safeguard proceedings ensure that the Company has sufficient cash to finance its up to the effective completion of the Financial Restructuring  expected at the end of March 2024  allowing the Group to cover its liquidity needs for the 1st quarter of 2024  estimated at around 600 million euros. The completion by the end of March 2024 of the Financial Restructuring will meet the Group's estimated liquidity needs until the end of March 2025  in accordance with the accelerated safeguard plan approved by the Paris Commercial Court on 26 February 2024  and this by taking into account the impact of the disposal of HM/SM assets over the same period under the agreements with Groupement Les Mousquetaires  Auchan Retail and Carrefour. Under these conditions  consolidated net working capital would be sufficient to meet the Company's obligations over the next twelve months from the date of approval of the Prospectus.Governance and restrictions on the transfer of Shares : The completion of the Financial Restructuring of the Group will result in a change of control of the Group to France Retail Holdings S.à.r.l. (an entity ultimately controlled by Mr. Daniel Křetínský) On the date of the Financial Restructuring  Mr. Jean-Charles Naouri will resign from all his functions with immediate effect; as well as all members of Casino Board of Directors  with the exception of Ms Nathalie Andrieux. The overall composition of the Board of Directors will be proposed by the Consortium. It is envisaged that the Company will refer to the AFEP-MEDEF Code recommendations  it being specified that the composition and powers of the audit committee and the Compensation and Appointments Committee will comply with the recommendations of the said Code. The Company will remain listed on Euronext Paris.Expert's report: The Company voluntarily appointed Sorgem Evaluation  located at 11 rue Leroux  75116 Paris  and represented by Mr. Maurice Nussenbaum  as an independent expert  in accordance with article 261-3 of the AMF's general regulations  to give an opinion on the fairness of the terms and conditions of the Company's restructuring from the point of view of current shareholders.

The year 2023 was devoted to restructuring the Company  and non-recurring expenses had to be incurred in order to reduce Tonner Drones' structural costs and prepare for its future development. As a result  the Company anticipates that its sales in 2023 will be very low and it will be loss-making taking into account the first half of 2023  with sales of 88 216 euros and net income of -8 829 451 euros  and the second half of 20231  dedicated to the restructuring of Tonner Drones  which in particular generated significant legal expenses. Shareholders and investors should therefore expect large losses for fiscal year 2023. The Capital Increase is intended to clean the financial situation and to enable management to focus on rebuilding the company from 2nd quarter 2024.The Company's new strategy  aimed at creating value for all shareholders  is based on the following pillars:increasing the value of its holdings in the various French drone companies it owns  notably DONECLE and ELISTAIR;the development of COUNTBOT  a promising solution designed to facilitate warehouse logistics management by combining the technologies of ground robots and aerial drones to carry out rapid  accurate and automated inventories;a strategic focus on the defense sector 2   a market estimated by Tonner Drones at over a billion dollars  with INHIBITOR in particular  its modular military drone that the Company plans to develop with partners and for which it has filed several patents; and  a market estimated by Tonner Drones at over a billion dollars  with INHIBITOR in particular  its modular military drone that the Company plans to develop with partners and for which it has filed several patents; and a fabless business model  aimed at concentrating on the design and marketing of products and working with partners on the production side.In September 20233  as part of its strategic focus on the defense sector  Tonner Drones initiated a collaboration with the Ukrainian defense group Techaviacom  enabling it to add value to a stock of equipment held by Tonner Drones from the former Delta Drone activities. Techaviacom and Tonner Drones are currently examining ways of deepening their collaboration  which could create value for both parties.For the new management of Tonner Drones  the drone and drone related technologies sector is still a fragmented market  with many small players operating on part of the drone industry value chain  either on the software or hardware side  with excellent teams. As a listed company with the requisite managerial expertise and financial backing  Tonner Drones is well positioned to become a drone industry aggregator thereby ensuring seamless integration along all lines and creating shareholder value.In order to secure its financing for at least the next 12 months  Tonner Drones has opted for a traditional method of financing  through a capital increase with shareholders’ preferential subscription rights  thus enabling all current shareholders  but also new investors  to take part in the financing and the new future of Tonner Drones.The management of Tonner Drones is opposed to Equity Line programs with the issue of new shares at a variable price based on the issuer's share price. Tonner Drones found investors willing to buy back all the convertible bonds held by Yorkville Advisors  thereby terminating its Equity Line agreement4. As part of the Capital Increase  these same investors have undertaken to freely subscribe to the transaction by offsetting their debts against the amount of the convertible bonds they hold and to contribute a further €1.078.516 in cash  corresponding to subscription commitments totalling approx. €2.6 million .Following the reserved capital increases carried out in August 20235  the Company's Chairman is once again demonstrating its commitment by participating in the Capital Increase through a commitment to subscribe for an amount of one million euros by way of debt compensation and would thus hold 20 06% of the Company's share capital in the event of completion of 100% of the Capital Increase. The Chairman’s objective is to maintain his position as the Company's main reference shareholder over the long term.This Capital Increase  intended primarily for Tonner Drones shareholders but also open to all investors  has the following main objectives:cover the Company's working capital requirements for the next twelve months (up to approximately 20% of the Capital Increase); andreduce the Company's financial debt and clear its trade payables (up to approximately 80% of the Capital Increase).Mr. Jean-François OTT  Chairman of the Board of directors  and Mr. Brad Taylor  Chief Executive Officer  said: ""The purpose of this fund-raising is to complete the restructuring of Tonner Drones that has been underway since May 2023  as well as its strategic reorientation towards drones for the defense  private security and public safety sectors. We have opted for a financing operation with shareholders' preferential subscription rights  in order to unite as many of the Company's historical shareholders as possible  as well as new investors  around our development project for Tonner Drones  and we intend to make no further use of Equity Line financing programs."".MAIN TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE CAPITAL INCREASEShare capital before the transactionAt the launch date of the transaction  Tonner Drones’ share capital comprised 1 659 093 fully subscribed and paid-up shares with a par value of €0.025 each  listed on Euronext Growth Paris.Tonner Drones Share codesLabel: Tonner DronesISIN Code: FR001400H2X4Ticker: ALTDPlace of listing: Euronext Growth ParisLEI Code: 9695000EAC5UI2LAPJ16Nature of the transactionThe capital increase proposed by the Company involves the issue of new shares (the ""New Shares"") with maintaining of preferential subscription rights (“PRS”)  on the basis of 120 New Shares for 1 existing share  through the issue of 199 091 160 New Shares.The New Shares issued in connection with the Capital Increase will carry dividend rights and will be the subject of an application for listing on the Euronext Growth Paris market.

No issue premium will therefore be added to the subscription price.The subscription price represents a discount of 97.22% to the closing price on March 11  2024 (€0.90).The subscription price is to be fully paid up at the time of subscription in cash and/or by offsetting receivables.Maximum amount of the Capital Increase and maximum number of New SharesThe gross amount of the Capital Increase is €4 977 279.00 corresponding to the issue of 199 091 160 New Shares.Subscription periodSubscription for the New Shares will be open from March 18  2024 to March 27  2024 inclusive.Preferential subscription rightEach shareholder will receive one preferential subscription right for each share registered in his or her securities account at the close of trading on March 15  2024. In order to guarantee registration in the share account on this date  orders for existing shares on the Euronext Growth Paris market must be executed no later than March 13  2024.Subscription for the New Shares is reserved  by preference  for (i) holders of existing shares  who will be allocated one preferential subscription right per existing share  and (ii) transferees of the preferential subscription rights.Each holder of preferential subscription rights may subscribe:by irrevocable entitlement  on the basis of 120 New Shares for 1 existing share held  without taking account of fractional shares;on a reducible basis  the number of New Shares they would like in addition to that to which they would be entitled as a result of the exercise of their irreducible preferential subscription rights. Any New Shares not taken up by irrevocable subscribers will be allocated to reducible subscribers  within the limit of their requests and in proportion to the number of existing shares for which preferential subscription rights have been used to support their irrevocable subscriptions  without this resulting in the allocation of a fraction of a New Share.PSRs may only be exercised up to the number of PSR required to subscribe for a whole number of New Shares. Holders of preferential subscription rights who do not hold a sufficient number of existing shares or preferential subscription rights to obtain a whole number of New Shares  by way of irreducible subscription  will be responsible for acquiring on the Euronext Growth Paris market the number of preferential subscription rights needed to reach the multiple required to obtain a whole number of New Shares.Fractional PSRs may be sold on the Euronext Growth Paris market during the period in which the PSRs are listed  under ISIN code FR001400ONI6.In the event that the same subscriber submits several separate subscriptions  the number of New Shares to which he or she is entitled on a reducible basis will be calculated on the basis of all his or her subscription rights only if he or she expressly makes a special request to this effect in writing  no later than the closing date for subscriptions. This request must be attached to one of the subscriptions and must give all the information required for the aggregation of rights  specifying the number of subscriptions made and the authorized institution(s) or intermediary(ies) with which these subscriptions have been deposited.Subscriptions in the name of separate subscribers may not be grouped together to obtain New Shares on a reducible basis.The Company owns 30 treasury shares.To exercise their preferential subscription rights  holders must contact their authorized financial intermediary at any time during the subscription period  i.e. between March 18  2024 and March 27  2024 inclusive  and pay the corresponding subscription price of €0.025 per New Share in cash and or by offsetting receivables. Unexercised preferential subscription rights will automatically lapse at the end of the subscription period  i.e. on March 27  2024 at the close of trading.A notice published by Euronext will announce  where applicable  the allocation scale for subscriptions subject to reduction.Free subscription requestsIn addition to the possibility of subscribing on an irreducible and reducible basis in accordance with the specified terms and conditions  any individual or legal entity  whether or not holding preferential subscription rights  may subscribe to the Capital Increase on a voluntary basis.Persons wishing to subscribe on a voluntary basis must submit their request to their authorized financial intermediary at any time during the subscription period and pay the corresponding subscription price.In accordance with the provisions of Article L. 225-134 of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce)  unrestricted subscriptions will only be taken into account if the irreducible and reducible subscriptions have not absorbed the entire Capital Increase  it being specified that the Chief Executive Officer will have the option of freely allocating the unsubscribed New Shares  in whole or in part  among the persons (shareholders or third parties) of its choice who have made unrestricted subscription requests.Listing of preferential subscription rightsTonner Drones’ shareholders will receive 1 preferential subscription right (“PSR”) for each share held (i.e.  a total of 1 659 093 PSRs issued).

The subscription price of the New Shares shows a discount of 22.44% compared with the theoretical value after detachment of the PSR.These values do not prejudge either the value of the PSR during the PSR trading period  or the value of Tonner Drones shares ex-rights  or discounts  as they will be observed on the market.Preferential subscription rights detached from treasury shares held by the CompanyPursuant to Article L. 225-206 of the French Commercial Code  the Company may not subscribe for its own shares. PSR detached from treasury shares held by the Company at March 14  2024 will be sold on Euronext Growth Paris before the end of their trading period  pursuant to Article L. 225-210 of the French Commercial Code.Limitation of the amount of the Capital IncreaseIn the event that irreducible  reducible and unrestricted subscriptions do not absorb the entire Capital Increase  the Board of Directors may limit the amount of the Capital Increase to the amount of subscriptions received  in accordance with Article L. 225-134 of the French Commercial Code  on condition that the latter reaches at least €3 792 929.25  corresponding to 75% of the gross amount of the Capital Increase.

The management intends to stop financing itself through any type of product with a variable issue price for new shares.The only mechanism for issuing new shares at a variable price depending on the share price still active at the date of this press release is the debt equitization program set up under a trust agreement relating to a French fiducie (“Fiducie A”) entered into between the Company and the trustee Equitis Gestion on September 15  2022 and amended on January 3  2023 and June 7  2023.Subject to the approval of the trust beneficiaries’ of Fiducie A and the execution of a new amendment to the trust agreement before the end of the subscription period  it is envisaged that Fiducie A subscribe to the Capital Increase for an amount of €250 000 by way of offsetting receivables. If Fiducie A  for whatsoever reason  is not able to subscribe for New Shares  Tonner Drones would then repay this amount in cash.After the Capital Increase  the balance of Tonner Drones' receivables held by Fiducie A will be around €2.1 million. As with the convertible bond contract  Tonner Drones aims to terminate this variable price product  like it did with the convertible bonds agreement.Until then  Fiducie A will be able to continue to ""equitize"" the receivables it holds on Tonner Drones with a selling restriction capped at a maximum of 13.5% of daily volume.After completion of the Capital Increase  and taking into account in particular commitments to subscribe for shares by offsetting receivables and planned repayments from the net proceeds of the transaction  the Company's gross financial debt will be around €6.25 million  with no short-term maturities. These financial debts include:receivables held with Fiducie A that may be subject to equitization  amounting to around €2.1 million;regular bonds held by Crazy Duck  Kennie Capital  Courcelette Holding and Ott Heritage for around €3.2 million (including interest);a shareholder loan of €1.0 million (including interest).TIMETABLE OF THE CAPITAL INCREASEMarch 1  2024 Decision of the Board of directors deciding on the principle of the transaction March 8  2024 Start of the period of suspension of the securities giving access to the Company’s capital March 11  2024 Setting of the terms and conditions of the transaction by the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and launch of the transaction March 12  2024Distribution of the press release relating to the transaction Publication by Euronext of the notice of issuance March 13  2024Publication in the BALO of the notice to the shareholders concerning the transaction Closing date for market purchases of existing shares entitling the purchaser to PSR attached thereto March 14  2024 Admission and start of negotiation of the PSR March 15  2024 Deadline for registration of existing shares entitling their holders to receive PSR March 18  2024 Start of subscription periodStart of PSR exercise period March 25  2024 End of PSR trading period March 27  2024 End of subscription period April 2  2024 Notice of completion of the transaction April 3  2024Distribution of the press release relating to the transaction outcome Publication of Euronext notice of admission of the New Shares April 5  2024 Settlement-delivery of the New SharesListing of the New Shares on Euronext Growth Paris April 8  2024 End of period of suspension of the securities giving access to the Company’s capital April 30  2024 Date of publication of the 2023 annual results and of the annual financial reportSUBSCRIPTION TERMSThe Capital Increase will be carried out with shareholders maintaining their preferential subscription rights  and with the option to subscribe for shares on an irreducible basis  on a reducible basis and on an unrestricted basis.Each shareholder will receive one preferential subscription right for each share registered in his or her securities account at the close of trading on March 15  2024.

are available free of charge on the Company's website.The occurrence of any or all of these risks could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business  financial condition  results of operations  development or prospects. The risk factors presented in the aforementioned documents remain unchanged as of the date of this press release.In addition  investors are invited to consider the risks specific to the Capital Increase:the PSR market may offer only limited liquidity and be subject to high volatility;shareholders who do not exercise their pre-emptive rights will see their stake in the Company's capital diluted;the market price of the Company's shares could fluctuate and fall below the subscription price of the New Shares;the volatility and liquidity of the Company's shares could fluctuate significantly;in the event of a fall in the market price of the Company's shares  the PSRs could lose their value;sales of the Company's shares could occur on the market and adversely affect the Company's share price; andthe Company's residual indebtedness will remain high following the Capital Increase and the Company could be forced to carry out further capital increases which could result in potentially significant dilution for shareholders  similar to that of the Capital Increase.ELIGIBILITY OF THE TRANSACTION FOR THE ARTICLE 150-0 B TER OF THE FRENCH GENERAL TAX CODE (REINVESTMENT OF CAPITAL GAINS) AND ELIGIBILITY OF TONNER DRONES SHARES FOR PEA AND PEA PME-ETI ACCOUNTSWhen shares are transferred to a company controlled by the transferor  the capital gain is tax-deferred (Article 150-0 B ter of the French General Tax Code (Code général des impôts)). If the contributed shares are sold within three years  the tax deferral is terminated  unless the Company undertakes to reinvest 60% of the proceeds of the sale in an economic activity within two years of the sale. In particular  the proceeds may be invested in a cash subscription to the initial capital or to a capital increase in one or more companies that meet the conditions of business activity  corporate income tax liability and head office location set out in a of 2° of I of Article 150-0 B ter and in the first paragraph of b and c of 3° of II of Article 150-0 D ter of the French General Tax Code. In this respect  the capital increase constitutes a reinvestment eligible for capital gains tax relief insofar as the nature of the reinvestment is concerned.Other conditions for applying the scheme  which are independent of the Company (reinvestment deadline and threshold  retention of new shares  etc.)  must also be complied with by the subscriber. Investors likely to benefit from this regime are advised to consult their usual tax advisor to assess their personal situation with regard to the specific regulations applicable.Finally  Tonner Drones points out that it complies with the eligibility criteria for the PEA PME-ETI schemes specified in Articles L. 221-32-2 and D. 221-113-5 and seq. of the French Monetary and Financial Code (Code monétaire et financier). As a result  Tonner Drones shares can be fully integrated into stock savings plans (PEA) and PEA PME-ETI accounts  which benefit from the same tax advantages as the classic PEA.PROSPECTUSIn accordance with the provisions of Article L. 411-2-1 1° of the French Monetary and Financial Code and Articles 211-2 and 211-3 of the General Regulations of the French Financial Markets Authority (Autorité des marchés financiers - ""AMF"")  the Capital Increase does not give rise to a prospectus subject to approval by the AMF insofar as the total amount of the offering calculated over a twelve-month period does not exceed €8 000 000.FIND ALL THE DOCUMENTATION RELATING TO THE CAPITAL INCREASE ON WWW.TONNERDRONES.COM/FINANCETonner Drones will publish its annual results for 2023 and its financial statements for 2023 by April 30  2024 at the latest.About Tonner Drones: Tonner Drones (formerly Delta Drone) develops drones and associated technologies for the defense and homeland security sectors.

A number of major broadcasters and content companies are expected to trial this breakthrough solution in 2024.”“As more live events move online – or to online only – we are already seeing a big increase in traffic. MAUD is a revolutionary development in how we deliver content over the internet. It will improve video streaming experiences for viewers  delivering a more reliable  consistent picture and will increase content delivery efficiency for broadcasters and video service providers ” said Howard Watson  chief security and networks officer at BT Group. “We’re excited to partner with Broadpeak  a technology provider with a successful track record for multicast ABR innovation and deployments  to leverage their technology as part of the MAUD solution.”Broadpeak is providing BT Group with components to create the world’s first MAUD-enabled network  including its nanoCDN mABR  a proven and widely deployed solution across the world for video streaming. The nanoCDN will integrate into BT Group’s consumer smart hub routers and leverage multicast capabilities to group individual streams together in the network core  before converting them back to unicast at the edge for consumption by player applications on end-user devices. With MAUD  video service providers can serve millions of viewers with a single stream  improving content delivery efficiency and reducing costs for broadcasters  CDNs  and internet service providers.MAUD’s unique architecture takes mABR one step further by integrating seamlessly with content provider player applications  eliminating the need to modify customers’ apps.

And by efficiently delivering live video streaming  it allows broadcasters and video service providers to deliver a higher quality of experience.“We are very excited to support BT Group with the launch of such an impressive live video streaming initiative ” said Jacques Le Mancq  CEO of Broadpeak. “MAUD answers the critical requirements for enhanced video quality  simpler content delivery  and increased sustainability  making it a game changer for broadcasters and video service providers.”More information about Broadpeak solutions can be found at https://broadpeak.tv.# # #About Broadpeak ® (https://broadpeak.tv)Broadpeak® designs and manufactures video delivery components for content providers and network service providers deploying IPTV  cable  OTT  and mobile services.

After 3 years of heavy investment and structuring  adjustments to expenses have been made at the end of 2023 with the closure of the Ottawa (Canada) and Leigh (UK) sites.Growth trajectory reaffirmed  with the aim of improving operational efficiency and profitabilityThe Lumibird Group  European leader in laser technologies  improved its reported EBITDA by 10% to €34.5m (+15% to €36.1m excluding the acquisition of Convergent). This performance reflects tight cost control against a backdrop of sales growth. As the Group is positioned and structured to continue to absorb growth in its markets  the improvement in profitability should continue in the years ahead.Extract from the condensed consolidated annual financial statements approved by the Board of Directorson 12 March 2024at 31 December (in €m)20222023reportedChange % Sales figures 191.0 203.6 +12.6 +6.6% EBITDA(1)% SALES 31.316.4% 34.517.0% +3.2 +10% Profit from recurring operations% SALES 16.48.6% 18.59.1% +2.1 +13% Operating profit 17.3 12.2 (5.1) -29% Profit before tax 14.4 7.5 (6.9) -48% Net income 11.4 7.1 (4.3) -38%(1) EBITDA corresponds to recurring operating income adjusted for charges to provisions and depreciation  net of reversals  and expenses covered by such reversals.Dynamic markets in a complex economic contextBusiness in 2023 was buoyant across all the markets addressed by Lumibird  particularly in the Defence/Space segment  which saw strong growth. However  growth was held back at the beginning of the year by reduced production capacity due to site redevelopments  and at the end of the year by postponed sales for regulatory or administrative reasons affecting the Medical division.The Photonics division grew by +7.8% (+7.4% excluding Convergent and at constant exchange rates).The Defence/Space segment  driven by growing demand and an attractive range of very high-tech products  including a majority of active components produced within the Group  grew by 30.9% to €39.4m (+34.5% at constant exchange rates). A significant 3-year contract worth €20 million was signed in September 2023 for the supply of laser rangefinders for airborne applications.The Lidar segment fell by 7.5% to €24.1m (down 6.1% at constant exchange rates). Lidar activities continue to grow strongly in the wind energy sub-segment  where Lumibird sells its Lidar systems directly  while there has been a one-off downturn in the 3D Scan sub-segment  although this does not call into question the strong growth prospects for this market.In Industrial and Scientific activities  the Group ended the year at €37.4m  stable at -0.1% (-5.0% excluding Convergent and at constant exchange rates). Sales generated by the Convergent business acquired at the end of August 2023 are included in Industrial and Scientific activities. They amounted to €2.7m in 2023 over 4 months.The Medical division reported sales growth of 5.5% over the year to €102.8m (up 7.6% at constant exchange rates)  held back by the postponement of sales to 2024 for regulatory reasons (delay in marketing authorisations) and administrative reasons (new purchasing policy for public hospitals in China). The breakdown of sales between diagnostics (23%) and treatment (77%) is similar to previous years.The currency effect had a negative impact on sales of €4.5m over 2023  split between Photonics (€2.4m) and Medical (€2.1m).Improved profitability in both divisionsSummary of results by divisionIn €MPhotonicsMedical 2022 2023 Change (%) 2022 2023 Change (%) Sales figures 93 5 100.8 +7.8% 97 4 102 8 +5 5% Gross margin% 58 162 2% 63.262.7% +8.7%59 861 3% 62 460 7% +4 3%EBITDA(1)% 14 215 2% 15.915.8% +12.2%17 117 6% 18 618 1% +8 4%ROC% 4 75 1% 5.95.8% +24.2%11 611 9% 12 612.3% +8 4%(1) EBITDA corresponds to recurring operating income adjusted for charges to provisions and depreciation  net of reversals  and expenses covered by such reversals.Against a backdrop of persistent inflationary pressures  the Group's gross margin is stable in 2023  to 61.7% from 61.8% a year earlier (slight increase to 62.1% excluding Convergent). The use of purchases via brokers in 2022 to secure supplies still had a significant residual impact this year  particularly for the Medical division. By the end of 2023  this residual impact had been fully absorbed.. On a reported basis  including the recent acquisition of Convergent  EBITDA rose by 10% to €34.5m  i.e. 17.0% of revenues. Convergent contributed negatively by -€1.6m to EBITDA. EBITDA margin excluding Convergent rose by almost +2 pts (from 16.4% to 18.0%). This increase was achieved by controlling external and personnel costs in both divisions.For the moment  the improvement in profitability is more marked in the Photonics division (EBITDA margin of 17.9% excluding Convergent  compared with 15.2% in 2022) than in the Medical division (18.1% compared with 17.6% in 2022)  which is still impacted by the residual additional purchasing costs associated with the shortages in 2022.The currency effect had a negative impact on EBITDA of €0.9m over 2023  split between Photonics (€0 5m) and Medical (€0 4m).On a reported basis  recurring operating income stands at €18.5m  compared with €16.4m in 2022. Convergent's contribution to recurring operating income is negative at -€2.4m. Excluding Convergent  recurring operating income stands at €20.9m.For Lumibird  2023 was the last year of the transformation plan  with the modernisation and rationalisation of its industrial facilities. After 3 years of strong investment and structuring  at the end of 2023  Lumibird entered an optimisation phase through a programme to adjust its workload structure. Lumibird has repatriated the activities of its Ottawa (Canada) and Leigh (UK) sites to Lannion. Operating profit includes non-recurring expenses relating to this reorganisation of the Lidar division  the relocation of the Les Ulis site and changes in the scope of consolidation totalling €6.3m (compared with non-recurring income of €0.9m in 2022).

This marks the final step of the financial restructuring of Vallourec that was initiated in 2021  when Apollo became Vallourec’s reference shareholder. This new investment by a world-class industrial player speaks to the breadth of the operational turnaround executed since that time  as well as the robust outlook for the premium seamless tubes business over the coming years.Vallourec welcomes the transition in reference shareholder from Apollo  the leader of Vallourec’s successful financial restructuring  to ArcelorMittal  a global steel industry player. ArcelorMittal is a world leader in steelmaking and mining  present in 60 countries and with primary steel production facilities in 15 countries. We are pleased with ArcelorMittal’s confidence in Vallourec's new trajectory and success in executing a substantial strategic shift. It also represents a long-term commitment  as ArcelorMittal shares with Vallourec a common industrial vision and complementary  world-renowned expertise. ArcelorMittal will hold 28 4% of the voting rights and 27 5% of the share capital of the Company following the closing of the transaction.This transaction was made possible by the New Vallourec plan  which was announced in May 2022 with the arrival of Philippe Guillemot as CEO. The New Vallourec plan  endorsed by Apollo since Philippe Guillemot’s arrival  has transformed the Group into a focused  streamlined  and resilient company with a promising future. Vallourec’s 2023 earnings were the best Group results in nearly 15 years  and the Group has reduced its net debt by more than €900 million versus third quarter 2022 peak. Vallourec remains on track to reach zero net debt by the end of 2025 at the latest and is undertaking several initiatives to continue to deliver enhanced shareholder value over the coming years.Vallourec further reiterates its outlook given in its Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Results press release. Based on current market conditions and management’s assumptions  Vallourec expects that Group EBITDA in the first half of 2024 will be broadly similar to second half 2023 EBITDA. For the full year  Vallourec anticipates strong EBITDA generation due to robust Tubes pricing in backlog and operational improvement. In keeping with prior years’ financial communication  Vallourec has not provided a quantitative full-year EBITDA outlook and expects it will provide such an outlook during the communication of its first half results.The completion of the acquisition is expected to close in the second half of the year  after obtaining the relevant regulatory approvals. Such acquisition will not entail a change of control of Vallourec and ArcelorMittal does not intend to launch a voluntary tender offer for Vallourec’s remaining shares over the next six months. Vallourec and ArcelorMittal will enter into discussions for a shareholders' agreement which will contain customary provisions for such type of transaction  with 2 board seats for ArcelorMittal upon closing of the acquisition (subject to negotiations). In accordance with applicable law  the main terms of the shareholders' agreement will be made publicly available in due course.Philippe Guillemot  Chairman of the Board of Directors  and Chief Executive Officer  declared:“I would like to thank Apollo  for its decisive action during Vallourec’s financial restructuring and its unfailing support in Vallourec’s financial and industrial turnaround that I initiated when I took over the helm of the Company two years ago. With Apollo’s help  we have fundamentally changed the operational and financial structure of Vallourec  and are now well-positioned to carry this momentum into the future. ArcelorMittal is a natural shareholder for Vallourec  and we are excited for the contributions it will bring to our Company. We share a passion for the global steel industry and share a common vision of its future. With this transaction  we transition from a world-class financial partner to a world-class industrial partner. I look forward to leading this magnificent group and continuing to realize the full potential of our premier industrial base.”Information and Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release includes forward-looking statements.

The meta-analyses are the first to focus solely on patients with the m.11778G>A ND4 mutation  which is the most common mutation and one with a poor visual prognosis 1 .Figure 1. Visual Recovery (CRR 1 from Nadir 2 ) Among ND4 LHON Patients – Results from Three New Meta-Analyses 3 4(See Figure 1)The meta-analyses depict a gradient of efficacy of visual recovery with LUMEVOQ ® intravitreal gene therapy resulting in greater recovery rates than that of idebenone treatment  and both greater than that in the natural history of the disease. This gradient of recovery  based on the CRR measure of visual improvement  is observed at both eye level and patient level (response in one or both eyes). There is no overlap in confidence intervals when LUMEVOQ ® is compared to idebenone and to natural history  indicating a positive difference in visual outcomes.The results were presented at the 2024 annual meeting of the North American Neuro-Ophthalmology Society (NANOS) and will also be presented at other major ophthalmology  neurology and neuro-ophthalmology medical conferences in Europe and the US later this year.Dr. Nancy J. Newman  LeoDelle Jolley Professor of Ophthalmology and Neurology at the Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta  United-States  presented the findings at NANOS 2024. She noted  “ This study is very important in order to compare these therapies’ abilities to achieve equivalent end-point metrics. It is clear that the degree of efficacy of the gene therapy was greater than the other currently available options of no treatment and idebenone use as previously administered in studies .”Based on the pre-defined statistical analysis plan  the three meta-analyses were performed on three groups of ND4 -LHON patients according to therapy: LUMEVOQ ® gene therapy one-time intravitreal injection  idebenone therapy and no treatment (natural history). To be included in the meta-analyses  studies had to satisfy a number of criteria that ensured comparability: for example  at least 3 data points per eye  information on the type of mutation with inclusion of ND4 patients only  and availability of visual outcomes data such as CRR. Clinically Relevant Recovery (CRR) is an accepted criterion of clinically meaningful visual improvement in LHON patients 6 and could be extracted from all three patient samples. The final set of qualifying studies consisted of five natural history studies (173 patients)  six idebenone studies (201 patients) and three LUMEVOQ ® studies (174 patients).“ The meta-analyses formalize the patient testimonies we have received that attest to the difference LUMEVOQ can make in patients’ lives : this treatment transforms the natural history of the disease  ” said Laurence Rodriguez   Chief Executive Officer of GenSight. “ The team is working hard to make sure that patients and clinicians facing the visual emergency that is LHON have access to an efficacious treatment .”The Company is currently engaging with authorities in the US  EU  and UK to align on the regulatory path for LUMEVOQ ® . The Company aims to restart the Early Access Program (AAC) in France in Q3 2024. Follow-up of patients in the Phase III REFLECT study of LUMEVOQ ® is ongoing  with topline results at Year 4 of follow-up expected this month.About GenSight BiologicsGenSight Biologics S.A. is a clinical-stage biopharma company focused on discovering and developing innovative gene therapies for retinal neurodegenerative diseases and central nervous system disorders. GenSight Biologics’ pipeline leverages two core technology platforms  the Mitochondrial Targeting Sequence (MTS) and optogenetics  to help preserve or restore vision in patients suffering from blinding retinal diseases. GenSight Biologics’ lead product candidate  GS010  is in Phase III trials in Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON)  a rare mitochondrial disease that leads to irreversible blindness in teens and young adults. Using its gene therapy-based approach  GenSight Biologics’ product candidates are designed to be administered in a single treatment to each eye by intravitreal injection to offer patients a sustainable functional visual recovery.About Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON)Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON) is a rare maternally inherited mitochondrial genetic disease  characterized by the degeneration of retinal ganglion cells that results in brutal and irreversible vision loss that can lead to legal blindness  and mainly affects adolescents and young adults. LHON is associated with painless  sudden loss of central vision in the 1 st eye  with the 2 nd eye sequentially impaired. It is a symmetric disease with poor functional visual recovery. 97% of subjects have bilateral involvement at less than one year of onset of vision loss  and in 25% of cases  vision loss occurs in both eyes simultaneously.About LUMEVOQ ® (GS010; lenadogene nolparvovec)LUMEVOQ ® (GS010; lenadogene nolparvovec) targets Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON) by leveraging a mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) proprietary technology platform  arising from research conducted at the Institut de la Vision in Paris  which  when associated with the gene of interest  allows the platform to specifically address defects inside the mitochondria using an AAV vector (Adeno-Associated Virus). The gene of interest is transferred into the cell to be expressed and produces the functional protein  which will then be shuttled to the mitochondria through specific nucleotidic sequences in order to restore the missing or deficient mitochondrial function. “LUMEVOQ” was accepted as the invented name for GS010 (lenadogene nolparvovec) by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in October 2018. LUMEVOQ ® (GS010; lenadogene nolparvovec) has not been registered in any country at this stage._________________________1 Newman et al: J Neuro-Ophthalmol 2020 Dec ;40(4):547-557.2 “Clinically Relevant Recovery”  or CRR  denotes an improvement in Best-Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) that satisfies one of two conditions: (1) A 10-letter (≥0.2 LogMAR) improvement for an on-chart starting visual acuity. (2) Improvement from “off-chart” to “on-chart” (≤1.6 LogMAR).3 Nadir = lowest observation of visual acuity between baseline and time point of interest.4 Three meta-analyses pre-definedin a statistical analysis plan5 Sources of data: For idebenone and natural history data  systematic review of the literature and available clinical/regulatory reports on ND4 LHON patients; for Lumevoq  all phase 3 studies (RESCUE/RESTORE  REVERSE/RESTORE and REFLECT).6 Carelli et al: J Neuro-Ophthalmol 2017 ; 0: 1-11View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240311531952/en/GenSight BiologicsChief Financial OfficerIvan Tortetitortet@GENSIGHT-BIOLOGICS.comLifeSci AdvisorsInvestor RelationsGuillaume van Renterghemgvanrenterghem@lifesciadvisors.com+41 (0)76 735 01 31,neutral,0.01,0.98,0.0,mixed,0.47,0.2,0.33,True,English,"['LUMEVOQ® Gene Therapy', 'GenSight Biologics', 'Initial Results', 'New Meta-Analyses', 'Visual Outcomes', 'NANOS 2024', 'm.11778G>A ND4 mutation', 'Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy', 'central nervous system disorders', 'Dr. Nancy J.

INFORMATION TO DISTRIBUTORS Solely for the purposes of the product governance requirements contained within: (a) EU Directive 2014/65/EU on markets in financial instruments  as amended (""MiFID II""); (b) Articles 9 and 10 of Commission Delegated Directive (EU) 2017/593 supplementing MiFID II; and (c) local implementing measures (together  the ""MiFID II Product Governance Requirements"")  and disclaiming all and any liability  which any ""manufacturer"" (for the purposes of the MiFID II Product Governance Requirements) may otherwise have with respect thereto  the Shares have been subject to a product approval process  which has determined that they each are: (i) compatible with an end target market of retail investors and investors 1 Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 June 2017 on the prospectus to be published when securities are offered to the public or admitted to trading on a regulated market  and repealing Directive 2003/71/EC iwho meet the criteria of professional clients and eligible counterparties  each as defined in MiFID II (the ""Positive Target Market""); and (ii) eligible for distribution through all distribution channels as are permitted by MiFID II (the ""Appropriate Channels for Distribution""). Notwithstanding the Target Market Assessment  distributors should note that: the price of the Subscription Rights and Shares may decline and investors could lose all or part of their investment; the Subscription Rights and Shares offer no guaranteed income and no capital protection; and an investment in the Subscription Rights or Shares is compatible only with investors who do not need a guaranteed income or capital protection  who (either alone or in conjunction with an appropriate financial or other adviser) are capable of evaluating the merits and risks of such an investment and who have sufficient resources to be able to bear any losses that may result therefrom.

ENFORCEMENT OF CIVIL LIABILITIES The Company is a public limited company incorporated under the laws of Sweden. As a result  the rights of holders of the Shares will be governed by Swedish law and the Company's articles of association (the ""Articles of Association""). The rights of shareholders under Swedish law may differ from the rights of shareholders of companies incorporated in other jurisdictions. The members of the Company's board of directors (the ""Board Members"" and the ""Board of Directors""  respectively) and the members of the senior management of the Company (the ""Management"") are not residents of the United States. Virtually all of the Company's assets and the assets of the Board Members and members of Management are located outside the United States.

The United States and Sweden do not currently have a treaty providing for reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgements (other than arbitral awards) in civil and commercial matters. Uncertainty exists as to whether courts in Sweden will enforce judgments obtained in other jurisdictions  including the United States  against the Company or its Board Members or members of Management under the securities laws of those jurisdictions or entertain actions in Sweden against the Company or the Board Members or members of Management under the securities laws of other jurisdictions. In addition  awards of punitive damages in actions brought in the United States or elsewhere may not be enforceable in Sweden. Similar restrictions may apply in other jurisdictions.

If the loan is converted in relation to the private placement  the conversion price shall be the subscription price in the placement less a discount of 15 percent  or on such terms as otherwise agreed between the lenders and the borrower. If the loan is converted at the maturity date  the conversion price shall be the volume-weighted average price per share on Euronext Growth Oslo over the thirty (30) consecutive trading days immediately preceding the maturity date with a 10 percent in discount. This financial measure provides the Company with flexibility to navigate the current landscape and conclude a financial solution that involves all stakeholders in the Company. Subject to approval by an extraordinary general meeting expected to be held on or about 2 April 2024 (the ""EGM"")  the Company has offered the lenders to convert the Convertible Loans (including interest until maturity) and the Bridge Loan (including interest until maturity) into new shares in the Company at the Subscription Price. The subscription price has been determined through negotiations with the lenders at arm's length and is deemed by the Company to be in accordance with market conditions. 4Hence  the Board of Directors has proposed that the EGM resolves on a set-off issue of a maximum of NOK 85 587 399  entailing an increase in the share capital of not more than SEK 3 180 421.950671464 to offset the Convertible Loans and the Bridge Loan. The Company has also issued a total of 5 280 328 warrants  each giving the right to subscribe for one (1) share in the Company. Strike price for the warrants ranges from 2.5 NOK to 8.5 NOK. 3.4.3 Outstanding authorisations 3.4.3.1 Authorisation for the Board of Directors to resolve upon the new issue of shares with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights At the extraordinary general meeting held on 2 February 2024  the Board of Directors was authorized to  with deviations from the shareholders' preferential rights  until the time of the next annual general meeting  on one or more occasions  resolve to issue new shares. Payment can be made against cash payment and / or through payment in kind and / or through set-off. Issue in accordance with the authorization shall take place on market terms  subject to any market issue discount  which the Company's Board of Directors deems to prevail on each individual occasion. The company's share capital and the number of shares may  with the support of the authorization  be increased in total by an amount or number that fits within the framework of the articles of association in force at any given time. 3.4.3.2 Authorisation for the Board of Directors to resolve upon the new issue of shares  warrants and/or convertibles with deviation from the pre-emption rights of shareholders At the annual general meeting held on 19 June 2023  the Board of Directors was authorized to  with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  until the time of the next annual general meeting  on one or more occasions  resolve to issue new shares  warrants and / or convertibles.

View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240311531952/en/Figure 1. Visual Recovery (CRR from Nadir) Among ND4 LHON Patients – Results from Three New Meta-Analyses (Graphic: Business Wire)GenSight Biologics (Euronext: SIGHT  ISIN: FR0013183985  PEA-PME eligible)  a biopharma company focused on developing and commercializing innovative gene therapies for retinal neurodegenerative diseases and central nervous system disorders  today announced initial results of new meta-analyses in Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON)  which show those treated with LUMEVOQ® (GS010; lenadogene nolparvovec) gene therapy experienced a rate of visual recovery greater than that of idebenone-treated patients and untreated (natural history) patients. The meta-analyses are the first to focus solely on patients with the m.11778G>A ND4 mutation  which is the most common mutation and one with a poor visual prognosis1.Figure 1. Visual Recovery (CRR1 from Nadir2) Among ND4 LHON Patients – Results from Three New Meta-Analyses3 4(See Figure 1)The meta-analyses depict a gradient of efficacy of visual recovery with LUMEVOQ® intravitreal gene therapy resulting in greater recovery rates than that of idebenone treatment  and both greater than that in the natural history of the disease. This gradient of recovery  based on the CRR measure of visual improvement  is observed at both eye level and patient level (response in one or both eyes). There is no overlap in confidence intervals when LUMEVOQ® is compared to idebenone and to natural history  indicating a positive difference in visual outcomes.The results were presented at the 2024 annual meeting of the North American Neuro-Ophthalmology Society (NANOS) and will also be presented at other major ophthalmology  neurology and neuro-ophthalmology medical conferences in Europe and the US later this year.Dr. Nancy J. Newman  LeoDelle Jolley Professor of Ophthalmology and Neurology at the Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta  United-States  presented the findings at NANOS 2024. She noted  “This study is very important in order to compare these therapies’ abilities to achieve equivalent end-point metrics. It is clear that the degree of efficacy of the gene therapy was greater than the other currently available options of no treatment and idebenone use as previously administered in studies.”Based on the pre-defined statistical analysis plan  the three meta-analyses were performed on three groups of ND4-LHON patients according to therapy: LUMEVOQ® gene therapy one-time intravitreal injection  idebenone therapy and no treatment (natural history). To be included in the meta-analyses  studies had to satisfy a number of criteria that ensured comparability: for example  at least 3 data points per eye  information on the type of mutation with inclusion of ND4 patients only  and availability of visual outcomes data such as CRR. Clinically Relevant Recovery (CRR) is an accepted criterion of clinically meaningful visual improvement in LHON patients6 and could be extracted from all three patient samples. The final set of qualifying studies consisted of five natural history studies (173 patients)  six idebenone studies (201 patients) and three LUMEVOQ® studies (174 patients).“The meta-analyses formalize the patient testimonies we have received that attest to the difference LUMEVOQ can make in patients’ lives: this treatment transforms the natural history of the disease ” said Laurence Rodriguez  Chief Executive Officer of GenSight. “The team is working hard to make sure that patients and clinicians facing the visual emergency that is LHON have access to an efficacious treatment.”The Company is currently engaging with authorities in the US  EU  and UK to align on the regulatory path for LUMEVOQ®. The Company aims to restart the Early Access Program (AAC) in France in Q3 2024. Follow-up of patients in the Phase III REFLECT study of LUMEVOQ® is ongoing  with topline results at Year 4 of follow-up expected this month.About GenSight BiologicsGenSight Biologics S.A. is a clinical-stage biopharma company focused on discovering and developing innovative gene therapies for retinal neurodegenerative diseases and central nervous system disorders. GenSight Biologics’ pipeline leverages two core technology platforms  the Mitochondrial Targeting Sequence (MTS) and optogenetics  to help preserve or restore vision in patients suffering from blinding retinal diseases. GenSight Biologics’ lead product candidate  GS010  is in Phase III trials in Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON)  a rare mitochondrial disease that leads to irreversible blindness in teens and young adults. Using its gene therapy-based approach  GenSight Biologics’ product candidates are designed to be administered in a single treatment to each eye by intravitreal injection to offer patients a sustainable functional visual recovery.About Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON)Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON) is a rare maternally inherited mitochondrial genetic disease  characterized by the degeneration of retinal ganglion cells that results in brutal and irreversible vision loss that can lead to legal blindness  and mainly affects adolescents and young adults. LHON is associated with painless  sudden loss of central vision in the 1st eye  with the 2nd eye sequentially impaired. It is a symmetric disease with poor functional visual recovery. 97% of subjects have bilateral involvement at less than one year of onset of vision loss  and in 25% of cases  vision loss occurs in both eyes simultaneously.About LUMEVOQ® (GS010; lenadogene nolparvovec)LUMEVOQ® (GS010; lenadogene nolparvovec) targets Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON) by leveraging a mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS) proprietary technology platform  arising from research conducted at the Institut de la Vision in Paris  which  when associated with the gene of interest  allows the platform to specifically address defects inside the mitochondria using an AAV vector (Adeno-Associated Virus). The gene of interest is transferred into the cell to be expressed and produces the functional protein  which will then be shuttled to the mitochondria through specific nucleotidic sequences in order to restore the missing or deficient mitochondrial function. “LUMEVOQ” was accepted as the invented name for GS010 (lenadogene nolparvovec) by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in October 2018. LUMEVOQ® (GS010; lenadogene nolparvovec) has not been registered in any country at this stage._________________________1 Newman et al: J Neuro-Ophthalmol 2020 Dec;40(4):547-557.2 “Clinically Relevant Recovery”  or CRR  denotes an improvement in Best-Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) that satisfies one of two conditions: (1) A 10-letter (≥0.2 LogMAR) improvement for an on-chart starting visual acuity.

We successfully completed our separation  listed on Euronext Brussels and Paris in December  while meeting our full year EBITDA target  and further strengthening our balance sheet. This was all achieved in the context of a volatile macroeconomic and business environment. We also used our strong cash generation to accelerate the pace of our capital investments in key strategic technologies and platforms  aligned with our mid-term targets.“Over the last two years  we have significantly outperformed our markets and peer group. While we currently expect a muted recovery in demand in many of our markets during 2024  I have never been more confident in the long-term drivers of our business and our teams’ ability to innovate and win new customers to unlock shareholder value.”2024 OutlookFor 2024  we expect the overall demand dynamics across our major end markets to reflect the trends we saw towards the end of 2023  with flattish overall volumes. In addition  the end of customer destocking in a number of our end markets has started to prompt a more stable demand outlook since the start of the year. More specifically  and based on our year-to-date performance  we expect our Q1 2024 underlying EBITDA to increase by approximately 20% versus the level achieved in Q4 2023.Full-year underlying EBITDA is currently estimated to be in the range of €1.4 billion and €1.55 billion. The lower end of range is aligned with current market dynamics and the annualised EBITDA performance we expect to achieve in Q1 2024. The higher end of the range assumes a modest year-on-year volume recovery  predominantly in the second half of the year  subject to the overall macroeconomic and demand environments.Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of €600-€650 million as we prioritise our investments based on the outlook for 2024 and take into account the acceleration of overall spend in 2023. Free Cash Flow is estimated to be in the range of €400 million and €500 million  excluding the previously announced c.$180million PFAS payment to the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection  which is expected to be made during Q2 2024.Aligned with the mid-term financial targets provided at our recent Capital Markets Day  the Syensqo team is focused on accelerating value creation by delivering superior revenue growth  margin expansion and increasing returns.Mid-term Financial TargetsSyensqo’s mid-term financial targets  as set at our Capital Markets Day  are as follows:Net sales growth: 5% to 7% (2024-2028)(2024-2028) Underlying EBITDA Margin (in %): to mid-20s by 2028by 2028 Return on Capital Employed: to mid-teens by 2028Register to the webcast scheduled at 14:00 CET here - Financial report - Financial calendar______________________________________________1Free cash flow after payment of net interests  coupons of perpetual hybrid bonds and dividends to non-controlling interests.

The schedule will play an important role in the protocol for BioSenic’s forthcoming pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial.GvHD is a common occurrence following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation  used to treat a range of blood and immune diseases  including several leukaemias and lymphomas. Standard treatment begins with corticosteroids  with mixed outcomes  and those with a chronic form of GvHD may need to continue treatment for years  highlighting the clear unmet need for better treatment. BioSenic previously conducted a Phase 2 clinical trial of intravenous ATO in cGvHD treatment following stem cell transplant  with results showing that the first-line use of ATO and corticosteroids in patients with moderate to severe disease is associated with both a high clinical response rate and less need for corticosteroids.Last year  BioSenic announced the results of an additional  observational post-hoc analysis of the full set of clinical data from the Phase 2 trial  improving the overall understanding of clinical response  safety (SAE/AE related to ATO) and cGVHD severity evolution after short cycle(s) of ATO treatment. It shows that the risk of loss of overall response over time is greater in patients who received only one cycle of ATO since they are in partial or complete remission at week 6 post-treatment compared to patients who received two cycles of second-line treatment. The use of 2 cycles of 4 weeks each  separated by a rest period of 4 weeks on ATO at 0.15mg/kg/day  should be optimal for the future treatment of cGvHD patients. The therapeutic schedule of the upcoming Phase 3 trial will be adapted thanks to a recent advance that allowed for an oral ATO formulation that can be taken at home.François Rieger  PhD  Chairman and CEO of BioSenic  said: ""Our careful analysis of the previous Phase 2 trial clinical data  obtained using a short sequence of administration of ATO to patients affected by chronic graft versus host disease  provides additional guidance for optimizing dosage and treatment timing of ATO. We are now focused on finalizing the submission package of our Phase 3 trial using our new oral formulation for ATO  to further confirm the positive therapeutic effects revealed by our first trial on a limited cohort of patients with moderate-to-severe disease. We are committed to demonstrate the exceptional therapeutic effect of ATO  in line with all previous preclinical and clinical recent data obtained in the field of autoimmunity. It is now clear that the strongest industrial positioning for BioSenic aligns with the recently revealed therapeutic power of arsenic trioxide  the main asset promoted by our company.”BioSenic is committed to exploiting the immune modulating potential of ATO in new ways for a range of diseases. In oncology  intravenous treatment with ATO has made acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) the most curable blood cancer since 20021 2. The company is now introducing an oral formulation of ATO under an exclusive licensing agreement from its partner Phebra for use in a one-month cycle treatment  repeated twice  which will significantly improve patient quality of life and compliance while reducing healthcare costs. BioSenic aims to better address the unmet medical need in cGvHD with this oral  take-at-home formulation  proven in earlier studies on APL patients to be safe and bioavailable compared to an intravenous delivered formulation. In addition  the company is developing other formulations to expand its potential applications into other immune-related disease areas.Online  “Best administration schedule of ATO for optimal efficacy and safety of ATO treatment in chronic Graft versus host disease ” is available online at https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202403.0645/v1.1Treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia with arsenic trioxide without ATRA and/or chemotherapy - A.

Following a reverse merger in October 2022  BioSenic combined its strategic positioning  key strengths and strong IP to develop products along two tracks  separately and in combination. The first platform leverages immunomodulatory properties of arsenic trioxide (ATO) for an entirely new arsenal of formulations  including oral delivery (OATO)  for anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune indications such as chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGvHD)  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and systemic sclerosis (SSc). In parallel  BioSenic develops innovative products through a second platform that includes cell therapies and strong IP protection for tissue repair technologies.BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About BioSenic's technology platformsThe ATO platform has immunomodulatory properties with fundamental effects on the activated cells of the immune system. One direct application is its use in autoimmunity to treat in its chronic  established stage. Chronic GvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT)  a curative treatment for patients with serious blood diseases  including cancers.BioSenic’s intravenous ATO formulation  Arscimed®  has orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA  and it has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy for skin  mucosae  and the gastrointestinal tract in an early Phase 2a study. The company is planning a confirmatory international Phase 3 study with its oral ATO (OATO) formulation. OATO will also target moderate-to-severe forms of SLE. BioSenic is also developing a new IP-protected composite ATO formulation for the treatment of SSc  a serious chronic disease that affects skin  lungs or vascularization  and has no current effective treatment. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models support the launch of a Phase 2 clinical trial.ALLOB is an allogeneic cell therapy platform made of differentiated  bone marrow-sourced mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs)  which can be stored at the point-of-use in hospitals. ALLOB represents a unique and proprietary approach to organ repair  and specifically to bone regeneration  by turning undifferentiated MSCs from healthy donors into bone-forming cells at the site of injury. BioSenic is studying the results of a recent Phase 2b trial  to optimise the efficacy of ALLOB by determining the best timing for therapeutic intervention and seeking partners to continue the development of promising underlying therapy strategies.The company is also exploring partnerships at all levels for its JTA-004 viscosupplement for a severe inflammatory subtype of osteoarthritis  following a positive post hoc analysis of Phase 3 data demonstrating safety and efficacy in selected osteoarthritic patients in support of any possible licensing.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAFrançois Rieger  PhD  CEOTel: +33 (0)671 73 31 59investorrelations@biosenic.comInternational Media Enquiries:IB CommunicationsMichelle BoxallTel: +44 (0)20 8943 4685michelle@ibcomms.agencyFrench Investor Enquiries:Seitosei ActifinGhislaine GasparettoTel: +33 (0)1 56 88 11 22ghislaine.gasparetto@seitosei-actifin.comMichael Scholzemichael.scholze@seitosei-actifin.comCertain statements  beliefs and opinions in this press release are forward-looking  which reflect the company or  as appropriate  the company directors’ current expectations and projections about future events.

The Board of Directors met on March 12  2024 and approved the audited 2023 financial statements for publication.Luc Themelin  Mersen's Chief Executive Officer  said: ""Mersen achieved another year of growth in 2023  exceeding all the objectives set at the start of the year  both in terms of sales  which reached a record €1.2 billion  and operating margin before non-recurring items  which came in at 11.3%. This performance is in line with the strategic plan presented last year  thanks to momentum in our growth markets  particularly the SiC semiconductor and electric vehicle markets. Our non-financial performance in 2023 was equally remarkable  with a 26% reduction in CO2 emissions intensity compared with 2022 while the proportion of women in engineering and managerial positions rose to more than 26%. At the same time  75% of our sales were eligible within the new EU Green Taxonomy. We have also aligned our CSR roadmap with the time frame for our strategic plan and set ambitious new objectives. These results allow us to propose to our shareholders a 17% increase in dividend payout  at €1.25 per share.For 2024  Mersen is once again targeting organic sales growth  of around 5% and an operating margin before non-recurring items of around 11% of sales. The Group will continue its growth initiatives by implementing a significant capital expenditure plan while maintaining cost discipline and building on its strengths  such as its ability to innovate and its close relationship with its customers. The success of all these ambitious projects will depend on the high level of commitment and expertise of the Group's employees. I would like to thank them wholeheartedly for all their hard work so far  and I have every confidence in their ability to press ahead with our roadmap.""The Group's results for 2023 will be presented on March 13  2024 at 10:00 a.m CET. The conference will be broadcastedin French with a simultaneous translation in English.

Approximately 5% of this growth was attributable to price increases. The unfavorable currency effect  in an amount of €39 million  was mainly due to the depreciation of the Chinese renminbi and the US dollar. The scope effect corresponds to the disposal of a German tantalum anti-corrosion equipment business in August 2023.In all  sustainable development markets (including renewable energies  electronics and green transportation) represented 56% of sales1.Group EBITDA before non-recurring items was 8.7% higher year-on-year  at €202.7 million (up 14% at constant exchange rates).This improvement was largely driven by positive volume and mix effects. Productivity gains and price increases helped offset the higher cost of raw materials  energy and labor. The EBITDA margin before non recurring items includes part of the R&D expenses related to the p-SiC project and costs related to staffing the dedicated EV team  even though sales in these markets are still limited. It also takes into account the cost of ramping up isostatic graphite production at the Columbia site (USA).Despite higher capital expenditure  depreciation and amortization increased only slightly due to planned start ups over the coming half-year periods.Operating income before non-recurring items came to €137.3 million  an increase of 12.9% on 2022 (up 19% at constant exchange rates)  while operating margin before non-recurring items widened 40 basis points to 11.3%.1This definition does not replace those used in the EU Taxonomy Regulation and Delegated Acts.Advanced Materials sales totaled €669 million  up 13.2% on an organic basis over the year. Growth was particularly robust in the Si and SiC semiconductor market  with sales reaching more than €150 million. As expected  sales in the renewable energy market were stable compared to the prior year  as the Group chose to allocate less production capacity to solar power in China. Lastly  deliveries for the chemicals market increased slightly.The operating margin before non-recurring items for the Advanced Materials segment was 15.7%  in line with 2022 (15.8%). The volume/mix effect was positive. Price increases and productivity gains did not completely offset inflation in raw material  energy and labor costs. The result also includes part of the R&D expenses on the p-SiC project as well as the cost of ramping up isostatic graphite production at the Columbia site.EBITDA before non-recurring items came to €149.8 million  accounting for 22.4% of sales versus 22.9% in 2022.Electrical Power sales reached €542 million for the year  representing organic year-on-year growth of 13.3%. Sales to the US electrical distribution market remained strong. Sales to transportation markets  including aeronautics  rail and electric vehicles  were also buoyant.Operating margin before non-recurring items for the Electrical Power segment grew sharply by 110 basis points to 10.1% (9.0% in 2022). Volume and mix effects were positive and partly offset the costs of setting up the electric vehicle team. Price increases and productivity gains more than offset inflation in raw materials and labor costs.EBITDA before non-recurring items came to €72.8 million  accounting for 13.4% of sales versus 12.9% in 2022.Net income attributable to owners of the parent came in at €81.6 million in 2023  an increase of more than 20% compared with 2022.Non-recurring items represented a net expense of €5.9 million for 2023  mainly comprising provisions for litigation and other expenses relating to acquisition projects  and impairment losses on underused assets.Net financial expense came to €19.3 million  up on 2022  due to a substantial rise in interest rates over the period impacting the proportion of variable-rate debt and the proportion of net debt in USD with higher rates. This expense also included IFRS costs for pension and lease commitments of around €5 million.The income tax expense was €26.2 million  corresponding to an effective tax rate of 23.4%  in line with 2022 (23.6%).Income from non-controlling interests (€4.3 million) essentially included Mersen Yantai (China) and Mersen Galaxy (China)  in which Mersen holds a 60% stake.The Group generated very strong cash flow from operating activities  thanks to improved operational profitability and a positive change in working capital requirement of €3.2 million. This change was driven by an increase in advance payments on contracts in the SiC semiconductor market. As a result  the WCR ratio was exceptionally low at 19.1% of sales versus 20.7% of sales in 2022. This percentage includes a significant amount of provisioned  unpaid bonuses in 2023  as is in 2022.Income tax paid represented an outlay of €25.0 million  up sharply year on year  as the Group benefited more in 2022 than 2023 from accelerated tax depreciation in the United States in connection with investments made at its Columbia plant and  to a lesser extent  special payment terms in China related to the health crisis. The increase in tax paid also reflects earnings growth.In 2023  capital expenditure reached a record level for the Group at €176.3 million. Almost 54% of this amount (€95 million) relates to the growth plan presented by the Group in March 2023  corresponding to investments to increase graphite and insulation felt production capacity  the expansion of graphite finishing plants and the extension of plants serving the electric vehicle market. The total budget of this multi-year plan amounted to €300 million. Other capital expenditure represented 6.6% of sales. Of these  21% relate to the maintenance  upkeep and modernization of plants and equipment  and 25% to other Group growth projects  including environmental and safety improvements at our sites.Investments in intangible assets (€11 million) related to the plan to digitize and modernize information systems which began in 2020. To a lesser extent  they concern the capitalization of certain R&D expenses on the EV and p-SiC projects.Consequently  net debt at December 31  2023 stood at €212.5 million  down compared with December 31  2022 (€240.6 million)  primarily reflecting the capital increase (net of costs) of €96 million completed in May and  conversely  the significant increase in capital expenditure as part of the Group's growth plan.For 2023  the Group reached a return on capital employed (ROCE) of 13.0% (12.5% in 2022)  in a favorable context of very significant utilization of production capacity and at a time when the investments made as part of the growth plan have only partially been put into operation.For the second year running  the Group has published the eligible and aligned proportions of its activities and capital expenditure in terms of the European Taxonomy Regulation.For 2023  75% of Mersen's sales were taxonomy-eligible  while 21% were taxonomy-aligned. For capital expenditure  85% was eligible and 16% was aligned.The Group's financial structure at December 31  2023 remained solid with a leverage ratio of 1.09x and a 25% gearing ratio.Changes in financial structure since December 31  2023:As part of its growth plan  on March 7  2024  Mersen successfully completed a Schuldschein private placement for €100 million with a maturity of almost six years. This financing facility  placed with a pool of European and Asian investors  was oversubscribed more than twice vs the amount initially planned.The transaction has maintained the average maturity of the Group's financing facilities at more than 4.5 years (based on committed authorized facilities)  preserved a significant number of available lines of credit and diversified the Group's sources of funding. It also demonstrates the support and confidence of the Group's financial partners in Mersen's financial strength and growth strategy.At the Annual General Meeting on May 16  2024  the Board of Directors will ask shareholders to approve the payment of a €1.25 per share cash dividend  stable vs 2022. This would result in a total payout of around €30 million  up 17% from 2022  because of the new shares issued as part of the capital increase. This would represent 37% of income attributable to Mersen shareholders  up from 33% in 2022. This ratio is in line with the Group's policy of distributing between 30% and 40% of attributable net income. The dividend payment date will be July 4  2024.In 2024  the Group will continue to roll out its medium-term plan. In particular  it will draw on its growth markets  where the Group expects to see:continued strong demand in the SiC semiconductor market;growth in the electric vehicle market;moderate growth in the Si semiconductor market;stability in renewable energies  due to the Group's decision to limit its production capacity for the solar market in China and redirect it to other markets.In its other markets  the Group expects to see:growth in the rail market  particularly in India;continued business growth in aeronautics;moderate growth in the chemicals market;growth depending on macro-economic trends for process industries.The Group will continue to increase its graphite and insulating felt production capacity  expand plants serving the SiC semiconductor market  and set up high-performance automated lines to meet ACC's demand for the batteries of the Stellantis Group's electric vehicles.The Group will also continue to strengthen its dedicated teams to handle the development of SiC projects  albeit with limited sales in 2024. The team dedicated to the electric vehicle market will continue its work  with modest sales in 2024.Moreover  as the Group accelerates its investment program  depreciation and amortization will increase significantly.Consequently  in 2024  the Group is aiming for:organic growth of around 5 %;operating margin before non-recurring items of around 11 % of sales;capital expenditure of between €200 million and €240 million  depending on the pace of project rollouts  including €110-150 million relative to the growth plan  in line with the Group's road-map.Bolstered by its progress in the SiC semiconductor and electric vehicle markets  Mersen established  in March 2023  new medium-term targets - more ambitious and with more distant time horizons - than those of its previous plan  accompanied by a significant investment plan. During 2023  the Group undertook to align its CSR roadmap with the 2027 time horizons established for the new targets. Although it includes the same priority commitments  some of the targets were adjusted to take account of the Group's change in dimension going forward to 2027.It includes:reducing CO2 emissions intensity by 35% (scopes 1 and 2) versus 2022;increasing the proportion of women engineers and managers by four percentage points versus 2022;reaching 27% of senior management positions occupied by women;increasing the number of employees with disabilities by 25% from 2022 levels.The new comprehensive CSR roadmap is presented in the appendix.The Group confirms the objectives of its 2027 growth plan as communicated on March 14  2023  namely:sales of around €1.7 billion;operating margin before non-recurring items of 12% of sales. This margin may vary by +/-50 basis points;recurring EBITDA margin of 19% of sales. This margin may vary by +/-50 basis points;ROCE of 13%  which may vary by +/-50 basis points.First-quarter 2024 sales: April 24  2024 after the markets close---Mersen is a global expert in electrical specialties and advanced materials for high-tech industries.

Larva Labs – Autoglyph #187 : $571 50…,"The year 2023 started with the first acquisitions of NFTs by museums and ended with another bull run on the stock markets and the main cryptocurrencies.The major event in cryptocurrencies is notably BlackRock's (the largest asset manager in the world) and Fidelity's introduction of ETFs directly invested in Bitcoin (Bitcoin spot ETFs) authorized by the SEC on 11 January 2024. This is a real consecration for Bitcoin which on 11 March 2024 was quoted at around 72 000 dollars  while Ethereum was at $4 000 (ETH ETFs are expected very soon).BlackRock and Fidelity have achieved the best ETF launches in 30 years thanks to Bitcoin. In their first month of trading  the “IBIT” and “FBTC” funds raised $6.5 billion  which is more than any of the 5 500 other index funds launched before them (according to Les Échos of 10 January 2024: “Bitcoin ETF: the SEC opens the doors of Wall Street wide to Bitcoin”.This is a new record for Bitcoin. Of the 5 535 ETFs launched over the last thirty years  none have gotten off to such a strong start as BlackRock's ‘IBIT' and Fidelity's ‘FBTC'  said Bloomberg expert Eric Balchunas.This Monday  March 11  2024  a Bloomberg report (by Tom Metcalf & Emily Nicolle) announces “The London Stock Exchange said it will start accepting applications for the admission of exchange traded notes backed by Bitcoin and Ether” in the second quarter  confirming London as the capital of cryptocurrencies on the European continent.This allows retail and professional investors to gain exposure to the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization  without having to directly hold the asset.Via cryptocurrencies  new collectors and art enthusiasts have been attracted to the art market  often younger than their predecessors. Not averse to speculation and the excitement of taking risks  these art enthusiasts and collectors solidly welded to their crypto-universe of Web 3.0.The near future of Artprice by Artmarket is the meeting place between Web 3.0. (Metaverse and NFT) and Artprice's artificial intelligence  its Intuitive Artmarket ® AI.The 2023 period in NFT auctions  significantly less speculative than the two previous years  allowed Digital Art to finally settle peacefully in the international cultural and economic environment. As the NFT market consolidates  Artprice draws up a summary of the transactions on NFTs hammered in auction rooms in 2023  dominated by Sotheby's  but which finished with Christie's “Next Wave” sale on the sidelines of the Art Basel Miami Beach fair.Monthly evolution of proceeds from public NFT auctions[ https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2024/03/image1-monthly-evolution-of-proceeds-from-public-nft-auctions.png ]“Artprice by Artmarket.com recognizes in Digital Art – whether via NFTs or Artificial Intelligence – a revolution that it would be infinitely better to support and accompany than to reject or denigrate”  affirms thierry Ehrmann  CEO of Artmarket.com and Founder of Artprice.“Artprice subscriptions will soon be able to be paid in ETH and BTC  and our databases have already been adapted to accommodate these two cryptocurrencies. We are very proud to support digital artists with the opening of our Standardized Marketplace to NFTs. Furthermore  we acquired and presented the works Flow (2023) by digital artist Josh Pierce on the cover of our latest Annual Report of the Contemporary Art Market in 2023 and the NFT work Chaos under the pure light by artist 1dontknows for our Annual 2023 Art Market report published in 2024.”Annual Report of the Contemporary Art Market in 2023:https://imgpublic.artprice.com/pdf/le-marche-de-lart-contemporain-2023.pdfhttps://imgpublic.artprice.com/pdf/the-contemporary-art-market-report-2023.pdfAnnual 2023 Art Market report published in 2024:https://imgpublic.artprice.com/pdf/le-marche-de-lart-en-2023.pdfhttps://imgpublic.artprice.com/pdf/the-art-market-in-2023.pdfThis NFT paradigm shift is well explained in the ARTE documentary  recently released in 5 languages: “NFT  Chaos in the art world”https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_08d_1oY-LoThroughout this documentary  thierry Ehrmann  visual artist  NFT artist and Founding CEO of Artprice.com  delivers his analysis accompanied by other artists  experts and international players in the world of Art NFTs.Any attempt to understand the significance of NFTs in Art History requires an appreciation of the digital and cultural revolution that they represent and some kind of prediction regarding their role and impact over the short and medium term.According to thierry Ehrmann “In its various annual reports on the Art Market and the regulated information it publishes as a listed company  Artprice by Artmarket.com has always said with regard to NFTs that it is impossible to apprehend this new market without a true understanding of Blockchain  crypto-currencies and their cultural origins among the Cypherpunks (period of PGP-type data encryption at the beginning of the 1990s).”Bearing in mind all the underlying parameters and data required  Artprice by Artmarket is the only organization on the global art market to be able to truly respond to the certification of primary issues of Art NFTs in an environment of cryptocurrencies and major international currencies.In 2024  Artprice will be uniquely positioned in its capacity as a certifier of primary issues of Art NFTs based on the fact that Artprice by Artmarket has been the Global Leader in Art Market Information for more than 27 years and is the creator and owner of its globally recognized databases. It also has the world's largest documentary collection of art market notes  manuscripts  codices and annotated sales catalogs from 1700 to the present day  which act as a guarantee of the authenticity and historical veracity of its databases.1.

Seven-digit auction results and other exceptional salesIn 2023  the seven best results of the year in the NFT category were hammered for Generative Art. This self-generating and random artistic approach is at the heart of the history of NFTs  notably with the controversial Profile Pictures (PFP) series such as the Bored Apes and the CryptoKitties. However  these series have now left their place at the forefront of the Generative scene to the abstract works created by artists like Dmitri Cherniak and Tyler Hobbs. Indeed  the series Autoglyph by Larva Labs now fetches higher prices than their CryptoPunks which made the artist duo famous.Among the most anticipated pieces last year at auction  five digital creations created by Keith Haring at the end of the 1980s were put on sale at Christie's in September 2023 by the Keith Haring Foundation. In the form of five unique NFTs (#1/1)  these experiments were carried out on the first computers equipped with digital creation software a few years after those conducted by Andy Warhol. All the works found buyers at prices between $250 000 and $350 000.https://onlineonly.christies.com/s/keith-haring-pixel-pioneer/lots/3479?sc_lang=enTop 20 results for NFT works sold at auction in 20231.

Both in auction rooms and on the MetaverseSotheby's now stands out as the most active auction house on the NFT market  regularly hosting sessions dedicated to this new medium. On 15 June 2023  Part II of its sale Grails: Property from an Iconic Digital Art Collection totaled $10.9 million in New York. But apart from these sales dedicated to NFTs  Sotheby's now also includes NFTs in general sessions: at its day sale of Contemporary Art on 19 May 2023 in New York  Tyler Hobbs' Fidenza #725 (2021) fetched over a million dollars (including fees)  against an estimated range of $120 000 - $180 000.https://www.artprice.com/artist/1062390/tyler-hobbs/nft/30222588/fidenza-725Under Patrick Drahi's leadership  Sotheby's has also deployed a brand new platform called Metaverse  entirely dedicated to Web3: https://metaverse.sothebys.com . In 2023  it hosted the sale of 5 000 photographs by Sebastião Salgado in the form of NFTs  then a session entitled Snow Crash curated by artist Tony Sheeder  and lastly  a sale of 500 unique works generated by the pioneer Vera Molnar (who sadly passed away shortly after on 7 December 2023).The projects carried out by Sotheby's on its Metaverse platform  however  deviate somewhat from public sales in terms of transparency and communication of results and are undoubtedly more similar to private sales. Several important NFT works are still visible today on the sothebys-grails.eth wallet and are – according to Michael Bouhanna (VP  Contemporary Art Specialist & Head of Digital Art and NFTs at Sotheby's) – available for private sale:CryptoPunk #6669:https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0xb47e3cd837ddf8e4c57f05d70ab865de6e193bbb/6669Fidenza #526:https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0xa7d8d9ef8d8ce8992df33d8b8cf4aebabd5bd270/78000526Bored Ape #8552:https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0xbc4ca0eda7647a8ab7c2061c2e118a18a936f13d/85524. ‘On-chain' versus ‘off-chain' transactionsThe majority of NFT artworks publicly auctioned by Sotheby's have so far gone through its main website  not through its Metaverse  and the transactions have therefore taken place outside the Blockchain. In other words  they were concluded “off-chain”; the hammer prices do not appear in the history of the NFT  where only a double transfer of ownership of the work is visible: from the seller's portfolio (of the artist or collector) to that of Sotheby's  and then from Sotheby's to the buyer's wallet  once payment is complete.These “off-chain” transactions allow the auction house to maintain greater control over the transactions  in particular to collect payment before transferring the work to its new owner. This allows Sotheby's to collect a commission by adding the usual fees. For its part  Christie's  which carries out “on-chain” transactions via its Christie's 3.0 platform https://nft.christies.com   does without a commission. Its FAQ specifies that “ Christie's 3.0 does not add Buyer's Premium to the hammer price” and that “You will need to pay a gas fee when you place a bid and  if applicable  when you pay sales tax and collect your NFT  Gas fees are not included in the final purchase price”. But these gas fees only concern the operating costs of the Blockchain and are not collected by the auction house.5. The entry of NFTs into museum collectionsThe year 2023 saw the first acquisitions of NFTs by several museums  starting with the most prestigious  the LACMA  the MoMA  the Pompidou Center  and the Granet Museum in Aix-en-Provence. Unlike the ambiguous situation of 2021 which saw several institutions put digital duplicates of their masterpieces on sale  it is now a matter of acquisitions of NFTs by museums  directly from artists or via their collectors.CryptoPunks #110 acquired by the Center Pompidou andCryptoPunks #3831 acquired by LACMAThe reluctance of auction houses regarding “on-chain” transactions is shared by museums  which are subject to strict regulations regarding the acquisition of works. The procedures they must follow sometimes conflict with the principles of transparency and decentralization of Web3. Public institutions therefore prefer for the moment to acquire “off-chain” works and avoid placing all their NFT artworks in a single wallet.The Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA)  which received a donation of 22 NFTs in February 2023 from anonymous collector Cozomo de' Medici  has only 8 pieces on its e-wallet. Several NFTs  like Fragments of an Infinite Field #972 by Monica Rizzolli  have not yet been delivered and are still on the Cozomo de' Medici wallet. As for the famous CryptoPunk #3831  the work has been placed in an independent portfolio.Official announcement of the 22 NFTs acquired by LACMA:https://unframed.lacma.org/2023/02/24/new-acquisition-cozomo-de-medici-collectionLACMA Collection on Opensea:https://opensea.io/0x9482B7FEF251Ebb81CeF01108c5512C27520003DFragments of an Infinite Field #972 de Monica Rizzolli :https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0xa7d8d9ef8d8ce8992df33d8b8cf4aebabd5bd270/159000972CryptoPunk #3831 by Larva Labs :https://opensea.io/0x0f7f63BA74681EfC4eab9777a463E2aF45916EDfMarcella Lista  Head Curator at the Centre Pompidou explains the procedure followed by the French museum to make its first NFT acquisitions:“The Center Pompidou has opened a digital wallet exclusively dedicated to the reception and conservation of tokens  knowing that the files of the works have been uploaded in parallel to be stored on the conservation servers of the Pompidou Center as is the case with any digital work in the collection. The works were acquired via a classic acquisition and distribution authorization contract  following the museum 's usual practice  and were paid in euros.“The various states of visibility of these works on NFT platforms and on the Pompidou Center database can be explained by the long contractualization procedure  their registration on our inventory  and their entry into the database. Works that have not yet appeared are being processed in this administrative  accounting and technical chain.”The Centre Pompidou NFT collection on Opensea:https://opensea.io/Centre_Pompidou_MNAMCryptoPunk #110 from the Centre Pompidou:https://cryptopunks.app/cryptopunks/details/1106. A reassuring start to 2024Auction houses Christie's and Sotheby's have started 2024 with one and two sales respectively dedicated to NFTs. Patrick Drahi's company has already taken the lead this year  generating 92% of the segment's turnover.Sotheby's sessions GRAILS: Starry Night and Natively Digital: An Ordinals Curated Sale totaled over $1 million each  with 19 and 18 lots sold respectively  and no unsold lots. One of the best results was hammered for Genesis Cat  for Taproot Wizards (2024) by digital artist FAR. It was generally believed that the NFT market was now focused on more ‘serious' creations  but this off-beat work – reminiscent of CryptoKitties – fetched the best NFT result at the start of 2024: $254 000 versus an estimated range of $15 000 to $20 000 (January 22 at Sotheby's in New York).https://www.sothebys.com/en/buy/auction/2024/natively-digital-an-ordinals-curated-sale/genesis-cat?locale=frAuction results exceeding $100 000 for Satoshi Nakamoto  Xcopy  Beeple and Des Lucréce continue to show that the success of these digital artists is not just anecdotal. In 2024 we will probably see a consolidation of the prices of works by these key signatures on the NFT market. And the rising values of Bitcoin and Ethereum will no doubt contribute to this progression.7. Top 50 Artists by NFT p ublic a uction turnover in 20231.

Larva Labs – Autoglyph #187 : $571 50…,"PARIS  March 12  2024 /PRNewswire/ -- The year 2023 started with the first acquisitions of NFTs by museums and ended with another bull run on the stock markets and the main cryptocurrencies.The major event in cryptocurrencies is notably BlackRock's (the largest asset manager in the world) and Fidelity's introduction of ETFs directly invested in Bitcoin (Bitcoin spot ETFs) authorized by the SEC on 11 January 2024. This is a real consecration for Bitcoin which on 11 March 2024 was quoted at around 72 000 dollars  while Ethereum was at $4 000 (ETH ETFs are expected very soon).BlackRock and Fidelity have achieved the best ETF launches in 30 years thanks to Bitcoin. In their first month of trading  the ""IBIT"" and ""FBTC"" funds raised $6.5 billion  which is more than any of the 5 500 other index funds launched before them (according to Les Échos of 10 January 2024: ""Bitcoin ETF: the SEC opens the doors of Wall Street wide to Bitcoin"".This is a new record for Bitcoin. Of the 5 535 ETFs launched over the last thirty years  none have gotten off to such a strong start as BlackRock's 'IBIT' and Fidelity's 'FBTC'  said Bloomberg expert Eric Balchunas.This Monday  March 11  2024  a Bloomberg report (by Tom Metcalf & Emily Nicolle) announces ""The London Stock Exchange said it will start accepting applications for the admission of exchange traded notes backed by Bitcoin and Ether"" in the second quarter  confirming London as the capital of cryptocurrencies on the European continent.This allows retail and professional investors to gain exposure to the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization  without having to directly hold the asset.Via cryptocurrencies  new collectors and art enthusiasts have been attracted to the art market  often younger than their predecessors. Not averse to speculation and the excitement of taking risks  these art enthusiasts and collectors solidly welded to their crypto-universe of Web 3.0.The near future of Artprice by Artmarket is the meeting place between Web 3.0. (Metaverse and NFT) and Artprice's artificial intelligence  its Intuitive Artmarket ® AI.The 2023 period in NFT auctions  significantly less speculative than the two previous years  allowed Digital Art to finally settle peacefully in the international cultural and economic environment. As the NFT market consolidates  Artprice draws up a summary of the transactions on NFTs hammered in auction rooms in 2023  dominated by Sotheby's  but which finished with Christie's ""Next Wave"" sale on the sidelines of the Art Basel Miami Beach fair.Monthly evolution of proceeds from public NFT auctionsInfographic - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2360542/NFT_auctions_1_Infographic.jpg[https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2024/03/image1-monthly-evolution-of-proceeds-from-public-nft-auctions.png]""Artprice by Artmarket.com recognizes in Digital Art – whether via NFTs or Artificial Intelligence – a revolution that it would be infinitely better to support and accompany than to reject or denigrate""  affirms thierry Ehrmann  CEO of Artmarket.com and Founder of Artprice.""Artprice subscriptions will soon be able to be paid in ETH and BTC  and our databases have already been adapted to accommodate these two cryptocurrencies. We are very proud to support digital artists with the opening of our Standardized Marketplace to NFTs.

It also has the world's largest documentary collection of art market notes  manuscripts  codices and annotated sales catalogs from 1700 to the present day  which act as a guarantee of the authenticity and historical veracity of its databases.1.

Seven-digit auction results and other exceptional salesIn 2023  the seven best results of the year in the NFT category were hammered for Generative Art. This self-generating and random artistic approach is at the heart of the history of NFTs  notably with the controversial Profile Pictures (PFP) series such as the Bored Apes and the CryptoKitties. However  these series have now left their place at the forefront of the Generative scene to the abstract works created by artists like Dmitri Cherniak and Tyler Hobbs. Indeed  the series Autoglyph by Larva Labs now fetches higher prices than their CryptoPunks which made the artist duo famous.Among the most anticipated pieces last year at auction  five digital creations created by Keith Haring at the end of the 1980s were put on sale at Christie's in September 2023 by the Keith Haring Foundation. In the form of five unique NFTs (#1/1)  these experiments were carried out on the first computers equipped with digital creation software a few years after those conducted by Andy Warhol. All the works found buyers at prices between $250 000 and $350 000.https://onlineonly.christies.com/s/keith-haring-pixel-pioneer/lots/3479?sc_lang=enTop 20 results for NFT works sold at auction in 20231.

Both in auction rooms and on the MetaverseSotheby's now stands out as the most active auction house on the NFT market  regularly hosting sessions dedicated to this new medium. On 15 June 2023  Part II of its sale Grails: Property from an Iconic Digital Art Collection totaled $10.9 million in New York. But apart from these sales dedicated to NFTs  Sotheby's now also includes NFTs in general sessions: at its day sale of Contemporary Art on 19 May 2023 in New York  Tyler Hobbs' Fidenza #725 (2021) fetched over a million dollars (including fees)  against an estimated range of $120 000 - $180 000.https://www.artprice.com/artist/1062390/tyler-hobbs/nft/30222588/fidenza-725Under Patrick Drahi's leadership  Sotheby's has also deployed a brand new platform called Metaverse  entirely dedicated to Web3: https://metaverse.sothebys.com. In 2023  it hosted the sale of 5 000 photographs by Sebastião Salgado in the form of NFTs  then a session entitled Snow Crash curated by artist Tony Sheeder  and lastly  a sale of 500 unique works generated by the pioneer Vera Molnar (who sadly passed away shortly after on 7 December 2023).The projects carried out by Sotheby's on its Metaverse platform  however  deviate somewhat from public sales in terms of transparency and communication of results and are undoubtedly more similar to private sales. Several important NFT works are still visible today on the sothebys-grails.eth wallet and are – according to Michael Bouhanna (VP  Contemporary Art Specialist & Head of Digital Art and NFTs at Sotheby's) – available for private sale:CryptoPunk #6669:https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0xb47e3cd837ddf8e4c57f05d70ab865de6e193bbb/6669Fidenza #526:https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0xa7d8d9ef8d8ce8992df33d8b8cf4aebabd5bd270/78000526Bored Ape #8552:https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0xbc4ca0eda7647a8ab7c2061c2e118a18a936f13d/85524. 'On-chain' versus 'off-chain' transactionsThe majority of NFT artworks publicly auctioned by Sotheby's have so far gone through its main website  not through its Metaverse  and the transactions have therefore taken place outside the Blockchain. In other words  they were concluded ""off-chain""; the hammer prices do not appear in the history of the NFT  where only a double transfer of ownership of the work is visible: from the seller's portfolio (of the artist or collector) to that of Sotheby's  and then from Sotheby's to the buyer's wallet  once payment is complete.These ""off-chain"" transactions allow the auction house to maintain greater control over the transactions  in particular to collect payment before transferring the work to its new owner. This allows Sotheby's to collect a commission by adding the usual fees. For its part  Christie's  which carries out ""on-chain"" transactions via its Christie's 3.0 platform https://nft.christies.com  does without a commission. Its FAQ specifies that "" Christie's 3.0 does not add Buyer's Premium to the hammer price"" and that ""You will need to pay a gas fee when you place a bid and  if applicable  when you pay sales tax and collect your NFT  Gas fees are not included in the final purchase price"". But these gas fees only concern the operating costs of the Blockchain and are not collected by the auction house.5. The entry of NFTs into museum collectionsThe year 2023 saw the first acquisitions of NFTs by several museums  starting with the most prestigious  the LACMA  the MoMA  the Pompidou Center  and the Granet Museum in Aix-en-Provence. Unlike the ambiguous situation of 2021 which saw several institutions put digital duplicates of their masterpieces on sale  it is now a matter of acquisitions of NFTs by museums  directly from artists or via their collectors.CryptoPunks #110 acquired by the Center Pompidou andCryptoPunks #3831 acquired by LACMAThe reluctance of auction houses regarding ""on-chain"" transactions is shared by museums  which are subject to strict regulations regarding the acquisition of works. The procedures they must follow sometimes conflict with the principles of transparency and decentralization of Web3. Public institutions therefore prefer for the moment to acquire ""off-chain"" works and avoid placing all their NFT artworks in a single wallet.The Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA)  which received a donation of 22 NFTs in February 2023 from anonymous collector Cozomo de' Medici  has only 8 pieces on its e-wallet. Several NFTs  like Fragments of an Infinite Field #972 by Monica Rizzolli  have not yet been delivered and are still on the Cozomo de' Medici wallet. As for the famous CryptoPunk #3831  the work has been placed in an independent portfolio.Official announcement of the 22 NFTs acquired by LACMA:https://unframed.lacma.org/2023/02/24/new-acquisition-cozomo-de-medici-collectionLACMA Collection on Opensea:https://opensea.io/0x9482B7FEF251Ebb81CeF01108c5512C27520003DFragments of an Infinite Field #972 de Monica Rizzolli :https://opensea.io/assets/ethereum/0xa7d8d9ef8d8ce8992df33d8b8cf4aebabd5bd270/159000972CryptoPunk #3831 by Larva Labs :https://opensea.io/0x0f7f63BA74681EfC4eab9777a463E2aF45916EDfMarcella Lista  Head Curator at the Centre Pompidou explains the procedure followed by the French museum to make its first NFT acquisitions:""The Center Pompidou has opened a digital wallet exclusively dedicated to the reception and conservation of tokens  knowing that the files of the works have been uploaded in parallel to be stored on the conservation servers of the Pompidou Center as is the case with any digital work in the collection. The works were acquired via a classic acquisition and distribution authorization contract  following the museum's usual practice  and were paid in euros.""The various states of visibility of these works on NFT platforms and on the Pompidou Center database can be explained by the long contractualization procedure  their registration on our inventory  and their entry into the database. Works that have not yet appeared are being processed in this administrative  accounting and technical chain.""The Centre Pompidou NFT collection on Opensea:https://opensea.io/Centre_Pompidou_MNAMCryptoPunk #110 from the Centre Pompidou:https://cryptopunks.app/cryptopunks/details/1106. A reassuring start to 2024Auction houses Christie's and Sotheby's have started 2024 with one and two sales respectively dedicated to NFTs. Patrick Drahi's company has already taken the lead this year  generating 92% of the segment's turnover.Sotheby's sessions GRAILS: Starry Night and Natively Digital: An Ordinals Curated Sale totaled over $1 million each  with 19 and 18 lots sold respectively  and no unsold lots. One of the best results was hammered for Genesis Cat  for Taproot Wizards (2024) by digital artist FAR. It was generally believed that the NFT market was now focused on more 'serious' creations  but this off-beat work – reminiscent of CryptoKitties – fetched the best NFT result at the start of 2024: $254 000 versus an estimated range of $15 000 to $20 000 (January 22 at Sotheby's in New York).https://www.sothebys.com/en/buy/auction/2024/natively-digital-an-ordinals-curated-sale/genesis-cat?locale=frAuction results exceeding $100 000 for Satoshi Nakamoto  Xcopy  Beeple and Des Lucréce continue to show that the success of these digital artists is not just anecdotal. In 2024 we will probably see a consolidation of the prices of works by these key signatures on the NFT market. And the rising values of Bitcoin and Ethereum will no doubt contribute to this progression.7. Top 50 Artists by NFT public auction turnover in 20231.

The Multicast-Assisted Unicast Delivery (MAUD) solution will enable more reliable  efficient  and sustainable live video streaming  with outstanding quality  and features Broadpeak’s nanoCDN™ multicast ABR (mABR). A number of major broadcasters and content companies are expected to trial this breakthrough solution in 2024.“As more live events move online – or to online only – we are already seeing a big increase in traffic. MAUD is a revolutionary development in how live video is delivered over the internet. It will improve video streaming experiences for viewers  delivering a more reliable  consistent picture and will increase content delivery efficiency for broadcasters and video service providers ” said Howard Watson  chief security and networks officer at BT Group. “We’re excited to partner with Broadpeak  a technology provider with a successful track record for multicast ABR innovation and deployments  to leverage their technology as part of the MAUD solution.”Broadpeak is providing BT Group with components to create the world’s first MAUD-enabled network  including its nanoCDN mABR  a proven and widely deployed solution across the world for video streaming. The nanoCDN will integrate into BT Group’s consumer smart hub routers and leverage multicast capabilities to group individual streams together in the network core  before converting them back to unicast at the edge for consumption by player applications on end-user devices. With MAUD  video service providers can serve millions of viewers with a single stream  improving content delivery efficiency and reducing costs for broadcasters  CDNs  and internet service providers.MAUD’s unique architecture takes mABR one step further by integrating seamlessly with content provider player applications  eliminating the need to modify customers’ apps. Using up to 50% less bandwidth during peak events  MAUD reduces energy usage through the reduction of the number of deployed caches. And by efficiently delivering live video streaming  it allows broadcasters and video service providers to deliver a higher quality of experience.“We are very excited to support BT Group with the launch of such an impressive live video streaming initiative ” said Jacques Le Mancq  CEO of Broadpeak. “MAUD answers the critical requirements for enhanced video quality  simpler content delivery  and increased sustainability  making it a game changer for broadcasters and video service providers.”More information about Broadpeak solutions can be found at broadpeak.tv.# # #About Broadpeak ® (broadpeak.tv)Broadpeak® designs and manufactures video delivery components for content providers and network service providers deploying IPTV  cable  OTT  and mobile services.

Passenger traffic : in 2023  the Tuscan Airport System handled 8.2 million passengers  with a +21.8% increase compared to 2022 and a 99.1% recovery on 2019.

Ordinary Shareholders' Meeting called on April 29  2024 (single call). Florence  March 12  2024 - The Board of Directors of Toscana Aeroporti S.p.A. (""Toscana Aeroporti""  the ""Company"")  - an Italian company listed on Euronext Milan of Borsa Italiana S.p.A. which manages Florence and Pisa airports - met today to examine and approve the Consolidated Financial Statements and the Draft Financial Statements of the Parent Company at December 31  2023. Toscana Aeroporti Chairman Marco Carrai stated: ""We are very satisfied with the excellent results achieved in 2023 in terms of both passenger traffic data and financial indicators reported by Florence and Pisa airports  within a particularly complex international context marked by various uncertainty factors. Looking at the future  we remain confident and determined  confirming our strategic vision. We are also launching the largest investment plan ever implemented at Pisa airport that provides for the expansion and restructuring of the existing terminal  in addition to the continuation and finalization of the activities relating to the approval of Florence airport's Master Plan and those instrumental to its implementation."" 2023 Passenger traffic results As already disclosed to the market  the Tuscan Airport System handled nearly 8.2 million passengers overall in 2023  increasing by +21.8% compared to 2022 and recovering by 99.1% on the 2019 pre-Covid year. Total flights grew compared to the previous year (+13.1%)  as did the load factor (+3.6 pps)  which rose from 80.1% in 2022 to 83.7% in 2023. Florence airport reported an all-time record in 2023  exceeding 3 million passengers for the first time  with an increase of +38.1% compared to 2022 and of +7.1% on the 2019 pre-Covid year. With over 5.1 million passengers handled in 2023  Pisa airport's passenger traffic grew by +13.7% compared to 2022 and recovered by 94.8% on the 2019 pre-Covid year. 1 In September 2023  the Council of State uphold Toscana Aeroporti's arguments in a dispute against Italy's Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport on the failure to adjust airport fees to the planned inflation rate for the 2008-2011 period. The judgement awarded a one-off amount of €5.4 million to Toscana Aeroporti. The amount was reclassified and allocated to the various regulated fees of origin. 1Consolidated operating results Total consolidated revenues reached €123.3 million compared to €90.4 million in 2022  with a +36.3% increase. Operating revenues amounted to €101.6 million  up +32.3% compared to €76.8 million in 2022. Aviation revenues stood at €78.1 million  increasing by +31.3% compared to €59.5 million in 2022 due to the higher traffic handled and the favorable second-instance judgement issued by the Council of State. Non-Aviationrevenues  as a result of the higher traffic handled  amounted to €36.9 million  up +20.1% compared to €30.7 million in 2022. Other revenues grew by +7.8% to €6.7 million  chiefly as a result of the operations of the subsidiary Toscana Aeroporti Costruzioni S.r.l. (+ €359 thousand). Revenues from construction services  directly connected with the investments made  amounted to €15.0 million  up +102.5% compared to €7.4 million in 2022. Total costs2 amounted to €82.2 million in 2023  up 17.1% compared to €70.2 million in 2022 as a result of the higher traffic reported for 2023 and the concurrent increase in costs for construction services associated with greater investments made during the year. These aspects were among the main reasons of the +15.8% increase in costs for services  totaling €46.6 million compared to €40.2 million in 2022. The change in personnel costs in 2023 (+€3.1 million) was attributable to the higher traffic handled and lower social shock absorbers compared to 2022. Airport fees amounted to €7 million in 2023  up 23.4% compared to the previous year. The increase was driven by the growing airport traffic handled by the Company that confirmed a strong demand for the services offered. EBITDA amounted to €41.7 million in 2023  up +99.6% compared to €20.9 million in 2022. EBITDA margin rose to 33.7%  increasing by 10.7 percentage points compared to 2022. EBIT sharply improved going from €7.2 million in 2022 to €26.2 million in 2023 (+ €19.0 million; +263.3%). Net finance costs were €6.8 million compared to €4.1 million in 2022  chiefly due to the higher banking interests accrued on outstanding loans. PBT amounted to €19.4 million compared to €3.1 million in 2022. The result from operating activities stood at €13.1 million compared to €1.4 million in 2022 (+€11.7 million). Net income from assets sold or held for sale was equal to zero in 2023 compared to €3.3 million in 2022  following the sale of an 80% interest in Toscana Aeroporti Handling S.r.l.  completed on December 30  2022. The Toscana Aeroporti Group's net result amounted to €12.6 million in 2023  sharply up compared to €4.7 million in 2022. Investments and financial results The Group's overall investments amounted to €16.2 million in 2023  testifying to its constant commitment to upgrading and expanding the infrastructures of its two airports. The most important investments related to the upgrade and expansion of Pisa airport's terminal and Florence airport's Master Plan. Net Financial Debt was €79.6 million at December 31  2023  down compared to €85.7 million in the previous year. This decrease was chiefly attributable to the fact that the cash flows generated by operating activities - which fully recovered compared to the pre-pandemics levels - were more than sufficient to support infrastructural investments and the dividend distribution for the period. The remainder  together with a portion of the year-start liquidity  was used for the outlay related to outstanding loans  thus improving the Group's net financial exposure. The Debt/Equity ratio was 0.75 compared to 0.85 in 2022. Adjusted net financial debt  i.e.  net of deferred payment commitments for acquisitions and right-of-use financial liabilities  amounted to €74.3 million at December 31  2023 compared to €79.2 million in the previous year. 2 It should be noted that  for an easier reading of the Company's margins  the costs for construction services for 2023 have been classified by nature under the relevant cost items (costs for consumables  service costs and personnel costs). Accordingly  the comparative figure for 2022 has also been reclassified. 2Significant events occurred after December 31  2023 Passenger traffic results in the first two months of 2024 Passenger traffic further grew in 2024 as well. In the first two months of the year  the Tuscan Airport System handled over 903 000 passengers overall  up +11.5% on the same period of 2023. Sale of the interest in Firenze Parcheggi On February 12  2024  Toscana Aeroporti S.p.A. sold its 8.16% interest in Firenze Parcheggi S.p.A. to Parcheggi Italia S.p.A. for €3.2 million  as it was no longer strategic for the Company. Main news on the 2024 summer operations Florence airport For the 2024 summer season  Volotea announced a new connection twice a week to Prague  for a total of 13 destinations reachable from Florence airport including Hamburg  Bilbao  Bordeaux  Lion  Marseille and Palermo. As of the summer season  Eurowings will start to operate its new connection three times a week to Düsseldorf. KLM will increase the number of its flights to Amsterdam.

Outlook A traffic level very close to the 2019 pre-Covid volume was confirmed in 2023  with the ensuing full recovery of operations and margins  despite the context of international tensions triggered by the still ongoing Russia- Ukraine and Israel-Palestine conflicts  which could impact passenger mobility in 2024. In 2024  the Company will focus on continuing and finalizing of all the activities related to the approval of Florence airport's Master Plan and those instrumental to its implementation  as well as on building Pisa airport's new Arrivals Terminal.

37424,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.telecomtv.com/content/digital-platforms-services/what-s-up-with-bt-us-traffic-trends-telegram-49905/,What’s up with… BT  US traffic trends  Telegram,BT turns to Broadpeak for next-gen content deliveryMobile traffic volumes in the US are skyrocketing Telegram is gaining traction and heading for an IPO,In today’s industry news roundup: BT is deploying specialist streaming tech from French firm Broadpeak to underpin its new live content streaming service; US mobile network traffic volumes have leaped by 129% in the past five years  according to Verizon; messaging platform Telegram is heading for 1 billion users and an IPO; and much more!BT has teamed up with French content delivery network (CDN) and video distribution technology specialist Broadpeak for the deployment of technology that will underpin the UK operator’s Multicast-Assisted Unicast Delivery (MAUD) solution  which has been “designed to be a more reliable  quality-focused and sustainable way of delivering live content over the internet” and was first announced late last year. Broadpeak’s nanoCDN multicast ABR (adaptive bitrate) system will be at the heart of MAUD  which is set to be put through its paces by “a number of major broadcasters and content companies” this year. “As more live events move online – or to online only – we are seeing a big increase in traffic ” noted BT’s chief security and networks officer  Howard Watson. “MAUD is a revolutionary development in how live video is delivered over the internet. It will improve video streaming experiences for viewers  delivering a more reliable  consistent picture  and increase content delivery efficiency for broadcasters and video service providers. We’re excited to partner with Broadpeak  a technology provider with a successful track record for multicast ABR innovation and deployments  to leverage their technology as part of the MAUD solution ” he added. The move makes sense to industry analyst Paolo Pescatore  who has tracked the development of the media delivery and telecom sectors for years. “BT has an extensive knowledge of traffic and the impact of video ” he noted  especially from its experience over the past decade with its BT Sport venture. “However  BT has learnt that it is best to partner to build solutions ” and the relationship with Broadpeak “represents a key step  as what BT is proposing is yet unproven. It is now up to Broadpeak to take BT’s MAUD concept and make it a commercial reality. All eyes will now be on the next test with broadcasters on a wider scale ” noted Pescatore in comments emailed to TelecomTV. “Broadpeak is one of the few players that stands out in a crowded market with a strong proven pedigree in delivery of video over next-generation networks ” added the analyst. The vendor’s multicast ABR solution has already been deployed by other telcos  including Bouygues Telecom in France and Orange Spain. News of the BT deployment will come as a welcome relief to Broadpeak  which has seen its share price tumble by more than 34% this year  though the new deal with the UK telco has given the French firm’s stock a 2% lift and it currently stands at €1.88 on the Euronext exchange. It’s also worth noting that the deployment of Broadpeak’s technology does not mean that BT will no longer use the CDN technology from Qwilt that it has already deployed in its Network Cloud platform – that remains in place  the operator told us.

In its Consumer Connections Report  the US operator analysed data from third parties  such as data.ai and Apple Music  and used “de-identified and aggregate information about traffic on Verizon’s connectivity services”. It found video streaming services dominated the landscape in 2023  with TikTok being “far and away the most popular” – users in the US spent an average of 1 hour 42 minutes per day on the app  compared with approximately an hour a day on YouTube and about 39 minutes on Facebook. In the second half of 2023 alone  nearly half (47%) of all consumer mobile traffic was devoted to video. Verizon also found “a growing demand for seamless connectivity” both at home and on the go. City-level monthly mobile smartphone usage has risen by 34% in the past year – up from 11.5GB per line in January 2022 to 15.5GB per line in November 2023.Privacy-conscious messaging platform Telegram has 900 million users (up from 500 million in 2021)  is ramping up its revenues  heading towards profitability and considering an IPO in the not-too-distant future  according to a Financial Times interview with the company’s CEO Pavel Durov  his first media engagement since 2017. Rival messaging platform WhatsApp  which is part of the Meta empire  has 1.8 billion users worldwide. For more commentary on Telegram  see this LinkedIn thread.Telecom-focused Turkish systems integrator Odine  whose main telco customers appear to be Turkcell  Turk Telekom  Vodafone and New Zealand’s Symbio (formerly TNZI)  has filed for an initial public offering (IPO) and plans to list its shares on the Istanbul stock exchange. The company  which specialises in helping network operators to migrate to cloud-native practices and platforms  says its IPO application has been approved and that its bankers will start the process of engaging with prospective investors on 13 March. While the company hasn’t yet responded to questions about how much it hopes to raise from the IPO  it has announced that a “substantial portion of the proceeds… will be allocated to support the company’s international growth objectives ” as well as funding operations and the completion of “innovative projects”. The company’s CEO  Alper Tunga Burak  noted: “This IPO approval marks a significant milestone for Odine  propelling us into an era of unprecedented growth and innovation. It promises to unlock the potential of groundbreaking technologies  including artificial intelligence  data analytics  and sustainable solutions  offering investors a chance to be part of the next generation of tech disruptors.” Odine is currently working with Red Hat to help Turkcell with its best-of-breed approach to telco cloud that will help the operator “break vendor lock-in”  explained Elif Yenihan Kaya  director of core network capabilities at Turkcell  in this video.US senators Ted Cruz and John Thune have proposed legislation that could once again allow the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to auction spectrum currently being used by the US government for commercial use. In a statement  the US Senate announced that the two politicians have put forward a Spectrum Pipeline bill  which would require the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) to identify at least 2 500MHz of mid-band spectrum that can be reallocated from federal use to non-governmental or shared use over the next five years. Of this spectrum  half will need to be freed up in the next two years. Additionally  the proposal calls for the FCC to auction at least 1 250MHz of spectrum for “full-power commercial wireless services  including 5G” within six years  which includes at least 600MHz to be auctioned within three years. “To dominate in next-generation wireless technologies  stay ahead of our adversaries  and advance strong economic growth  the US must create a pipeline to expand commercial access to mid-band spectrum ” noted senator Cruz. Senator Thune likened spectrum to “the lifeblood” of wireless communications  adding that the legislation would ensure that “crucial mid-band spectrum is made available for commercial 5G and advanced Wi-Fi use  which is a win-win for American entrepreneurs and consumers.” The proposal was welcomed by the likes of Nathan Simington  a commissioner at the FCC  Meredith Attwell Baker  president and CEO of CTIA  a trade association representing the wireless industry in the US  and Verizon’s SVP for federal government relations and public affairs  Robert Fisher. FCC’s authority to auction spectrum expired in March 2023 because the Senate failed to enact the necessary legislation. This resulted in the FCC losing its authority to auction spectrum for the first time in 30 years. Upon the expiration  FCC chair Jessica Rosenworcel said that in its history  the FCC has held 100 auctions  raising more than $233bn in revenues.The digital gap in South-east Asia is set to be addressed with the help of fixed wireless access (FWA) and satellite communication technologies. According to a new report from ABI Research  the FWA connectivity market in the region is expected to reach a value of US$1.33bn in 2028  while the adoption of satellite-enabled broadband services is expected to generate US$2.12bn in revenue in the same period. This uptake is attributed to the introduction of new FWA and satellite communication broadband service providers in the region  which is making plans more affordable. Indonesia and Thailand have been identified by the analyst company as the markets with the greatest potential to close the digital divide through the adoption of FWA and satellite connectivity  with a total of 3.17 million FWA connections and 2.58 million subscriptions to satellite-based broadband expected in 2028. And while FWA does not appear so suitable for the Philippines  ABI Research believes the country demonstrates “immense potential” for satellite communication services and expects it to be the largest market in the region in this segment in 2028.
