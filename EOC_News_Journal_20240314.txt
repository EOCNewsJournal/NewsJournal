37429,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rt.com/business/594178-euroclear-russian-assets-trouble/,Russia’s response to asset seizure could trigger global financial collapse – Reuters,Brussels’ plan to fund Kiev with Russia’s money could backfire  potentially jeopardizing global financial system  an EU official has said Read Full Article at RT.com,Brussels needs and an “emergency mechanism” in case its plan to fund Kiev with Russia’s money backfires  an EU official has saidThe entire global financial system could be jeopardized if Euroclear  the main EU clearing house holding hundreds of billions in frozen Russian money  is sued over using the money to fund Kiev  a senior bloc official has told Reuters. Brussels should withhold a tranche of cash as a “safety buffer ” in such an event  the official advised.The West has frozen roughly $300 billion in holdings belonging to the Russian central bank since the start of the Ukraine conflict two years ago. Brussels-based Euroclear holds around €191 billion ($205 billion) of the assets  and the EU is reportedly fast-tracking the decision to send Kiev the first tranche of up to €3 billion from profits generated by frozen Russian assets as early as July.Should the West proceed with expropriating the funds  the Russian central bank is likely to seize around €33 billion of Euroclear money held in the national securities depository in Moscow  the official said. Russia may also sue to seize Euroclear cash from depositories in Hong Kong and Dubai.Brussels will have to “ensure that there is no breach of financial stability ” an unnamed EU official told Reuters on Tuesday. “The moment the war ends and all settlements can be made  all the money that was provisionally retained will also be transferred to Ukraine. But we need a significant amount in Euroclear… because Euroclear will face a lot of claims.”Moscow has repeatedly warned that it will respond in kind if the West goes through with threats to confiscate Russian assets. The Finance Ministry said last month that Western states and companies themselves still have holdings in Russia that could be jeopardized if the frozen funds are tapped.If Western banks begin suing Euroclear for the loss of their money invested in Russia  “that’s the mechanism how Euroclear could be totally emptied ” the EU official warned.Euroclear Bank boasts of over €37 trillion in assets in custody globally  but if it runs out of liquidity amid a litany of lawsuits – the Belgian central bank may be forced to withdraw its license  causing a global financial crisis  the official warned.A number of Western countries remain divided over expropriating Russia’s frozen assets to aid Ukraine. While the US and UK support the direct seizure of the assets  some EU member states  including France and Germany  have recently warned that the move could negatively affect financial stability and erode trust in the euro’s status as a reserve currency.,neutral,0.02,0.62,0.36,negative,0.03,0.24,0.73,True,English,"['global financial collapse', 'asset seizure', 'Russia', 'response', 'Reuters', 'main EU clearing house', 'entire global financial system', 'global financial crisis', 'national securities depository', 'Belgian central bank', 'The Finance Ministry', 'Russian central bank', 'EU member states', 'senior bloc official', 'unnamed EU official', 'financial stability', 'Western states', 'Euroclear Bank', 'safety buffer', 'Hong Kong', 'significant amount', 'Western banks', 'Western countries', 'direct seizure', 'reserve currency', 'Russian money', 'Russian assets', 'The West', 'emergency mechanism', 'money backfires', 'first tranche', 'frozen assets', 'Brussels-based Euroclear', 'Brussels needs', 'Ukraine conflict', 'Euroclear money', 'Euroclear cash', 'case', 'plan', 'Kiev', 'hundreds', 'billions', 'Reuters', 'event', 'holdings', 'start', 'decision', 'profits', 'July', 'funds', 'Moscow', 'depositories', 'Dubai', 'breach', 'Tuesday', 'moment', 'war', 'settlements', 'lot', 'claims', 'kind', 'threats', 'companies', 'loss', 'trillion', 'custody', 'liquidity', 'litany', 'lawsuits', 'license', 'number', 'France', 'Germany', 'move', 'trust', 'status']",2024-03-13,2024-03-14,rt.com

It was noted the remaining funds  however  would have to stay in the West to create a buffer against Moscow's retaliation measures.Of the roughly $282 billion in Russian assets immobilized in Japan and the West  around $207 billion (€191 billion) are held at Euroclear  a clearinghouse based in Belgium.The official anticipates Euroclear may face a flurry of legal claims from Moscow if Russian money is transferred to Ukraine. The claims are due to come from the Russian Central Bank  which can seize €33 billion in Euroclear funds held in the national securities depository in Moscow as a tit-for-tat move  according to the official. Russia may also take legal action to seize Euroclear assets held in Hong Kong and Dubai. Western banks that have lost investment funds in Russia could also sue the clearinghouse  potentially leading to Euroclear's bankruptcy and triggering a domino effect  given Euroclear's key role in global financial transactions. The EU official warned that  ultimately  the trail of counterclaims could lead to nothing short of an economic crisis.Speaking to the Financial Times in mid-February  Lieve Mostrey  chief executive of Euroclear  warned that a G7 plan to use Russia’s frozen assets as a backstop to issue debt for Ukraine  or seize the immobilized assets altogether  could pose serious financial risks to Europe.Mostrey remarked that ""the risk is a bit lower"" if the West grabs profits generated by the frozen sovereign assets.Russia has underscored it will take retaliatory measures in response to any manipulations with its financial resources illegally immobilized by the West  and that it would perceive any form of grab as ""theft"". Euroclear is already facing between 50 and 100 lawsuits in Russian courts over the sanctioned assets.Any actions with Russian frozen assets will trigger a symmetrical response  Finance Minister Anton Siluanov told Sputnik in late February  adding that a similar quantity of foreign assets have been frozen in Russia.The Russian finance minister suggested last December that in the event of confiscation of Russian assets in Europe  Russia may tap foreign funds frozen in so-called Type ""C"" accounts  a special type of accounts for non-residents introduced by Russia in March 2022. One cannot withdraw money from these accounts as funds can only be used for a limited range of purposes  such as paying taxes or purchasing federal loan bonds.According to some estimates  by mid-March 2023  up to 1 trillion rubles (€10 billion) could have been accumulated in type ""C"" accounts in the form of dividends and coupons paid to investors from unfriendly countries at Russia's National Settlement Depository (NSD).Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov made it clear in early February that Russia is prepared for a decade-long legal battle over the potential seizure of its assets.https://sputnikglobe.com/20240312/giving-frozen-russian-assets-to-ukraine-would-break-the-global-financial-system-1117293295.htmlhttps://sputnikglobe.com/20240310/possible-use-of-russias-frozen-assets-by-eu-illegal-and-foolish---french-politician-1117235462.htmlhttps://sputnikglobe.com/20240312/foreign-investors-interested-in-exchange-of-frozen-assets---russian-finance-ministry-1117282857.htmlrussiawestmoscowSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rosiya Segodnya“ 252 602024Ekaterina BlinovaEkaterina BlinovaNewsen_ENSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rosiya Segodnya“ 252 601920 1080 true1920 1440 true1920 1920 trueSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rosiya Segodnya“ 252 60Ekaterina Blinovarussian sovereign assets immobilized in the west  russian central bank's assets  profits generated by russian frozen assets  eu seeking to grab profits generated by russian frozen assets  euroclear  brussels  legal battles over frozen assets  euroclear may be emptied  seizure of russian assets may lead to crisis in west",negative,0.01,0.26,0.72,negative,0.02,0.27,0.7,True,English,"['Frozen Russian Assets', 'Financial Crisis', 'Theft', 'West', 'up to 1 trillion rubles', 'Finance Minister Anton Siluanov', 'Russian finance minister', 'national settlement depository', 'national securities depository', 'federal loan bonds', 'Russian Central Bank', 'global financial transactions', 'serious financial risks', 'decade-long legal battle', 'anton siluanov russia', 'Ekaterina Blinova News', 'Type ""C"" accounts', 'moscow european union', 'Frozen Russian Assets', 'russian frozen assets', 'russian sovereign assets', 'special type', 'Russian courts', 'Financial Times', 'financial resources', 'legal ways', 'legal action', 'legal battles', 'Financial Crisis', 'US policy-makers', 'dmitry peskov', 'cdn1.img', 'gross amount', 'Kiev regime', 'retaliation measures', 'tat move', 'Hong Kong', 'Western banks', 'domino effect', 'key role', 'chief executive', 'G7 plan', 'retaliatory measures', 'late February', 'similar quantity', 'limited range', 'unfriendly countries', 'Kremlin spokesperson', 'early February', 'Rosiya Segodnya', 'Russian money', 'foreign assets', 'Sputnik International', 'remaining funds', 'investment funds', 'foreign funds', 'EU officials', 'economic crisis', 'legal claims', 'Lieve Mostrey', 'symmetrical response', 'potential seizure', 'Euroclear assets', 'Euroclear funds', 'tax profits', 'sputnikglobe', 'frozen-russian-assets', 'financial-crisis', 'Theft', 'form', 'world', 'nsd', 'Reuters', 'part', 'buffer', 'Japan', 'clearinghouse', 'Belgium', 'flurry', 'Ukraine', 'Dubai', 'bankruptcy', 'trail', 'counterclaims', 'mid-February', 'backstop', 'debt', 'manipulations', 'grab', '100 lawsuits', 'event', 'confiscation', 'residents', 'March', 'purposes', 'taxes', 'estimates', 'dividends', 'coupons', 'investors', 'global-financial-system', 'possible', 'russias-frozen-assets', 'french-politician', 'exchange', 'sputniknews', 'MIA', 'brussels', '50']",2024-03-13,2024-03-14,sputnikglobe.com

As well as the normal business conducted at an annual general meeting  your Board is proposing (i) to consolidate the Company's ordinary share capital  with the aim of improving the marketability of the Existing Ordinary Shares  (ii) to effect a reduction of the share capital of the Company  involving the cancellation of the Share Premium Account and the Capital Redemption Reserve and (iii) to seek authority from Shareholders for the Company to make market purchases of its own Ordinary Shares when it is appropriate to do so. Further details of the Share Consolidation and Capital Reduction are set out below. The formal notice of the Annual General Meeting is set out at the end of this document. Explanatory notes on all of the business to be considered at this year's Annual General Meeting appear on pages 19 and 20 of this document. Share Consolidation Reasons for the Share Consolidation The Directors believe that the Company's existing share capital structure is no longer appropriate. The Company has grown in size and the high number of shares in issue combined with the relatively low price per share is thought to result in excess volatility  reduced liquidity and a widening in the bid/offer spread of the Existing Ordinary Shares. The Directors are therefore proposing to consolidate the Existing Ordinary Shares so that every 50 Existing Ordinary Shares are consolidated into one new ordinary share of 12.5p. The Share Consolidation will reduce the number of shares in issue from 1 067 648 507 Existing Ordinary Shares to 21 352 971 New Ordinary Shares. The Share Consolidation is expected to: increase the Company's share price proportionately;help improve the market liquidity of  and trading activity in  the Company's shares;provide the basis for a narrowing in the spread of its bid and offer price; and 5enhance the perception of the Company and its prospects and help improve the marketability of the Company's shares to a wider group of investors. The Share Consolidation requires the approval of Shareholders by way of a special resolution at the AGM. Application will be made in accordance with the AIM Rules for the New Ordinary Shares arising from the Share Consolidation to be admitted to trading on AIM  subject to Shareholders passing Resolution 6 at the Annual General Meeting. It is expected that if Resolution 6 is passed  Admission in respect of such New Ordinary Shares will become effective and that dealings in those New Ordinary Shares will commence on 2 April 2024. The new ISIN Code and SEDOL Code will be notified once these have been allocated. Procedure As at the date of this document  the Company has 1 067 648 507 Existing Ordinary Shares in issue  with a closing mid-market price of 1.38 pence per Existing Ordinary Share as at 4 March 2024 (being the latest practicable Business Day prior to the date of this document). It is therefore proposed  pursuant to the Share Consolidation  that the Existing Ordinary Shares are consolidated on a 50 for 1 basis  so that every 50 Existing Ordinary Shares are consolidated into one ordinary share of 12.5 pence in nominal value. No Shareholder will be entitled to a fraction of a New Ordinary Share. Instead  their entitlement will be rounded down to the nearest whole number of New Ordinary Shares. If a Shareholder holds fewer than 50 Existing Ordinary Shares at the Record Date  such that the rounding down process results in a Shareholder being entitled to zero New Ordinary Shares  then as a result of the Share Consolidation they will cease to hold any Ordinary Shares (of any description) in the capital of the Company. Remaining fractional entitlements to New Ordinary Shares will be aggregated and sold on behalf  and for the benefit  of the Company. Under the Company's articles of association  the Directors have a discretion as to how to deal with fractional entitlements  including by accounting to Shareholders for the net proceeds of any sale. The maximum fractional entitlement that any Shareholder would be entitled to would be worth only 12.25p and so  given the cost of remitting the net proceeds of sale to Shareholders  the Directors believe that the most sensible approach is to apply the net proceeds of sale for the benefit of the Company. In order to ensure that the Share Consolidation does not result in a fraction of a New Ordinary Share being created  the Company will prior to the Record Date issue such number of Ordinary Shares as will result in the total number of Existing Ordinary Shares being divisible by 50. These additional Ordinary Shares will be issued to the Registrars and will only represent a fraction of a New Ordinary Share. This fraction will be aggregated with the other fractions referred to above and sold in the market. 6For the avoidance of doubt  the Company is only responsible for dealing with fractions arising on registered holdings. For Shareholders whose Existing Ordinary Shares are held in nominee accounts of UK stockbrokers  the effect of the Share Consolidation on their individual shareholdings will be administered by the stockbroker or nominee in whose account the relevant Existing Ordinary Shares are held. The effect is expected to be the same as for shareholdings registered in beneficial names  however  it is the stockbroker's or nominee's responsibility to deal with fractions arising within their customer accounts  and not the Company's responsibility Assuming a share capital of 1 067 648 507 Existing Ordinary Shares immediately prior to the Record Date (plus 43 additional Ordinary Shares to be allotted to the Registrars)  following completion of the Share Consolidation the Company will have 21 352 971 New Ordinary Shares in issue. Capital Reduction Background to and reasons for the Capital Reduction As at 30 September 2023  the Company had retained losses of £8 799 820 and continues to have a negative distributable reserves position meaning that it is unable to declare dividends or make distributions to Shareholders or buy back its Ordinary Shares. The Company has built up a substantial Share Premium Account through the issue of shares for cash at values in excess of the nominal value of those shares. As at the date of this document  the balance standing to the credit of the Share Premium Account is £10 909 617. The Share Premium Account constitutes a non-distributable reserve for the purposes of the Act. In addition  the Company has built up a Capital Redemption Reserve through the redemption of an earlier series of deferred shares. As at the date of this document  the balance standing to the credit of the Capital Redemption Reserve is £3 336 916. The Capital Redemption Reserve constitutes a non-distributable reserve for the purposes of the Act. The Company is therefore seeking the approval of Shareholders to cancel the Share Premium Account and Capital Redemption Reserve which  subject to the confirmation of the High Court will enable the Company to eliminate the retained losses and create distributable reserves equal to the balance. The distributable reserves will be available for the Directors to use for the purposes of paying dividends  should circumstances in the future make it desirable to do so. Further details of the Capital Reduction are set out below. Share Premium Account and Capital Redemption Reserve Share premium is treated as part of the capital of a company and arises on the issue by a company of shares at a premium to their nominal value. The premium element is credited to 7the share premium account. Likewise  on a redemption or buy back of shares by a company an amount equal to the nominal value of the redeemed or bought back shares is credited to the capital redemption reserve. The share premium account and the capital redemption reserve are non-distributable capital reserves and a company's ability to use any amount credited to those reserves is limited by the Act. However  with the approval of its shareholders by way of a special resolution and subsequent confirmation by the High Court  a company may reduce or cancel its share premium account and its capital redemption reserve and in certain circumstances either return all or part of the sum arising to shareholders as a return of capital  or credit some or all of such sum arising to its profit and loss account. To the extent that the release of such a sum from the cancellation of shares  a share premium account and/or a capital redemption reserve creates or increases a credit on the profit and loss account  that sum represents a company's distributable reserves. As mentioned above  the cancellation of the Share Premium Account and the Capital Redemption Reserve will eliminate the Company's retained losses and create distributable reserves equal to the balance. Procedure In order to effect the Capital Reduction  the Company firstly requires the authority of its Shareholders by the passing of Resolution 7 at the Annual General Meeting to approve the cancellation of the Share Premium Account and the Capital Redemption Reserve. Secondly  the Capital Reduction must be confirmed by the High Court  to which the Company will make an application if Resolution 7 is passed. The Court Hearing to confirm the Capital Reduction is expected to be held on or around 30 April 2024. Shareholders will have the right to attend the Court Hearing in person or through counsel or other suitably qualified persons to support or oppose the sanction of the Capital Reduction. The Capital Reduction will take effect when the Court Order confirming it  and a statement of capital approved by the High Court  have been delivered to and registered by the Registrar of Companies. The Effective Date of the Capital Reduction is currently expected to be on or around 1 May 2024. In order to approve the Capital Reduction  the High Court will need to be satisfied that the interests of the Company's creditors will not be prejudiced by the Capital Reduction. There is a possibility that the Company may be required to give undertakings or other forms of creditor protection for the benefit of the Company's creditors at the date on which the Capital Reduction becomes effective. These may include seeking the consent of the creditors to the cancellation of the Share Premium Account and the Capital Redemption Reserve or the provision by the Company to the High Court of an undertaking to deposit a sum of money into a blocked account created for the purposes of discharging creditors of the Company. 8The Board reserves the right (where necessary by application to the High Court) to abandon  discontinue or adjourn any application to the High Court for confirmation of the Capital Reduction  and hence the Capital Reduction itself  if the Board believes that the terms required to obtain confirmation are unsatisfactory to the Company or if as the result of any material unforeseen event the Board considers that to continue with the Capital Reduction is inappropriate or inadvisable. Effect of the Capital Reduction If approved by Shareholders and confirmed by the High Court  the Capital Reduction will result in the creation of distributable reserves which will allow the Company to make market purchases of Ordinary Shares and to pay dividends in due course  should it be appropriate or desirable to do so. The Capital Reduction will not affect the number of Ordinary Shares in issue  the nominal value per Ordinary Share or the voting or dividend rights of any Shareholder. Buy-back Authority The Company holds surplus cash resources which are not required in the normal day-to-day management of its business so the Directors intend to use the authority granted by Resolution 11 to make market purchases of Ordinary Shares when it is appropriate to do so. If passed  Resolution 11 will give authority for the Company to purchase up to 2 135 297 of its New Ordinary Shares  representing approximately 10 per cent. of the issued share capital of the Company (assuming the Share Consolidation has become effective). Resolution 11 specifies the minimum and maximum prices which may be paid for any Ordinary Shares purchased under the authority. The authority will expire on the earlier of the date falling 15 months from the date of the passing of Resolution 11 and the conclusion of the Company's next annual general meeting. The Company may either cancel any Ordinary Shares it purchases under the authority granted by Resolution 11 or transfer them into treasury (and subsequently sell or transfer them out of treasury or cancel them). The Directors currently intend to cancel all shares purchased under the authority granted by Resolution 11. The Directors will only exercise the authority to purchase Ordinary Shares where they consider that such purchases will be in the best interests of Shareholders generally and will result in an increase in earnings per Ordinary Share.

37435,Euroclear,Bing API,https://www.irishexaminer.com/world/arid-41353126.html,EU moves towards using €27bn in profit from frozen Russian assets for Ukraine,About $300bn belonging to the Russian central bank has been frozen in the west  largely in foreign currency  gold and government bonds.,EU leaders are to take a significant step towards confiscating €27bn in profit generated by Russian state assets frozen in Europe to help fund the war effort in Ukraine.Officials at the European Commission are poised to put forward what they believe is a legally robust proposal to be considered by member states  possibly before a meeting of prime ministers in Brussels next Thursday.About $300bn belonging to the Russian central bank has been frozen in the west  largely in foreign currency  gold and government bonds.About 70% of these are held in the Belgian central securities depository Euroclear  which is holding the equivalent of €190bn.Deposits held in Europe are likely to generate between €15bn and €20bn in after-tax profits between now and the end of 2027  depending on the evolution of global interest rates  a senior EU official said.This year they are expected to generate between €2bn and €3bn in profits  depending on potential interest rate changes – money that could then go straight to Ukraine.While officials are hopeful of an agreement on seizing the profits  they do not expect a deal yet on how the money should be used  because some states are against using it to fund Ukraine’s military  preferring that the cash be spent on reconstruction and humanitarian efforts.Ireland  for example  is bound by neutrality through its constitution but it contributes funds to Ukraine on condition that the money is spent on “non-lethal” purposes such as clearing landmines.Milana Nanna (9) from Ukraine living in Newbridge. Picture: Sam Boal/Rollingnews.ieSources say the European Commission will not offer options at this time in relation to the use of the money. “It means they can agree in principle to use the revenues of profits but then have a further discussion on where that money can go constitutionally for every member state ” one source said.“The process has gathered momentum and we expect the wheels will move very quickly on this once the decision is made.”Last month EU leaders agreed that the proceeds could be held in a separate account  clearing the war for “step B”  which would be a decision that this money could be confiscated and sent to Ukraine.The communique drafted by ambassadors for prime ministers’ approval next week is sufficiently vague.“The European Council reviewed progress on the next concrete steps towards directing extraordinary revenues stemming from Russia’s immobilised assets for the benefits of Ukraine including the funding of military support ” it states.It is expected that some of the money will be retained in the EU as part of a defence fund against expected Russian legal retaliation in the long term.Any agreement will put pressure on the British government to follow suit.The move is likely to be met with retaliation in Moscow before and after the end of the war  and officials think some of the money should be held in Euroclear as a defence buffer for any future court costs.“We need a significant amount in Euroclear … because Euroclear will face a lot of claims ” the official said.Russian courts do not recognise western sanctions and could move to seize €33bn in Euroclear’s assets held in national securities in Moscow.This week the Swiss parliament voted in favour of allowing some of the €8bn Russian assets it had on deposit to be used for reparations for damage caused by an aggressor.There has been concern that such a move would jeopardise Switzerland’s longstanding position of well-armed military neutrality.According to Agence France-Presse  its foreign minister  Ignazio Cassis  said: “We don’t have to blush when we talk about Ukraine on the international stage.”,neutral,0.08,0.7,0.22,negative,0.02,0.21,0.77,True,English,"['Russian assets', 'EU', 'profit', 'Ukraine', 'potential interest rate changes', 'Belgian central securities depository', 'global interest rates', 'Russian central bank', 'next concrete steps', 'future court costs', 'The European Council', 'Russian legal retaliation', '€8bn Russian assets', 'Russian state assets', 'senior EU official', 'national securities', 'Russian courts', 'member state', 'European Commission', 'EU leaders', 'significant step', 'robust proposal', 'prime ministers', 'foreign currency', 'government bonds', 'humanitarian efforts', 'lethal” purposes', 'Milana Nanna', 'Sam Boal', 'one source', 'separate account', 'step B', 'defence fund', 'long term', 'British government', 'defence buffer', 'significant amount', 'western sanctions', 'Swiss parliament', 'longstanding position', 'Agence France-Presse', 'foreign minister', 'Ignazio Cassis', 'international stage', 'military support', 'extraordinary revenues', 'war effort', 'tax profits', 'military neutrality', 'states', 'Ukraine', 'Officials', 'meeting', 'Brussels', 'gold', 'Euroclear', 'equivalent', 'Deposits', 'end', 'evolution', 'money', 'agreement', 'deal', 'cash', 'reconstruction', 'Ireland', 'example', 'constitution', 'funds', 'condition', 'non', 'landmines', 'Newbridge', 'Picture', 'Rollingnews', 'Sources', 'options', 'time', 'relation', 'use', 'principle', 'discussion', 'process', 'momentum', 'wheels', 'decision', 'proceeds', 'communique', 'ambassadors', 'approval', 'progress', 'immobilised', 'benefits', 'funding', 'part', 'pressure', 'suit', 'move', 'Moscow', 'lot', 'claims', 'favour', 'reparations', 'damage', 'aggressor', 'concern', 'Switzerland', 'armed']",2024-03-14,2024-03-14,irishexaminer.com

The repercussions of such legal action could extend beyond Euroclear  posing a threat to the stability of the entire global financial system.Since the onset of the Ukraine conflict two years ago  Western nations have frozen approximately USD300 billion in Russian central bank assets. Euroclear  based in Brussels  holds a substantial portion of these assets  totaling around EUR191 billion (USD205 billion). Amid discussions of utilizing profits from frozen Russian assets to support Kiev  the European Union is considering expediting the release of the first tranche of up to EUR3 billion to Ukraine as early as July.However  concerns have emerged regarding potential retaliatory measures by Russia if the frozen funds are expropriated. The Russian central bank could retaliate by seizing approximately EUR33 billion of Euroclear-held assets in the national securities depository in Moscow. Additionally  Russia may pursue legal action to seize Euroclear funds held in depositories located in Hong Kong and Dubai.In light of these threats  the European Union is contemplating withholding a portion of the frozen assets as a precautionary measure to safeguard Euroclear and prevent financial instability. While the intention remains to transfer the withheld funds to Ukraine once the conflict concludes  maintaining a significant reserve in Euroclear is deemed essential to mitigate potential legal claims and uphold financial stability.Amid escalating tensions and legal uncertainties surrounding the frozen Russian assets  Euroclear finds itself at the center of a complex geopolitical and financial challenge  with the potential to impact global financial markets and stability.MENAFN14032024000045015687ID1107976794,negative,0.03,0.21,0.76,negative,0.02,0.21,0.76,True,English,"['Russian assets', 'Euroclear', 'entire global financial system', 'senior European Union official', 'Russian central bank assets', 'global financial markets', 'primary clearing house', 'national securities depository', 'severe financial ramifications', 'potential retaliatory measures', 'potential legal claims', 'financial instability', 'financial challenge', 'Russian assets', 'Russian funds', 'legal action', 'legal uncertainties', 'Western nations', 'first tranche', 'Hong Kong', 'precautionary measure', 'significant reserve', 'financial stability', 'escalating tensions', 'complex geopolitical', 'Euroclear-held assets', 'frozen funds', 'substantial portion', 'Euroclear funds', 'Ukraine conflict', 'MENAFN', 'hundreds', 'billions', 'risk', 'lawsuits', 'repercussions', 'threat', 'onset', 'Brussels', 'discussions', 'profits', 'Kiev', 'release', 'July', 'concerns', 'Moscow', 'depositories', 'Dubai', 'light', 'intention', 'center']",2024-03-14,2024-03-14,menafn.com

The audit procedures have been carried out  and the audit report relaBng to the account cerBficaBon is available on the Company's website. The annual financial report for the financial year ending December 31  2023  is available on the Company's website: hGps://quantum-genomics.com/en/  “investors” secBon.On the occasion of the publicaBon of the annual results of Quantum Genomics  Jean-Philippe Milon  its Chairman and CEO  declared:“2023 was a year of refounda1on for Quantum Genomics. We worked to preserve our cash flow by restructuring our workforce and supplier debt so that we could launch a new  valuable  and sustainable business project. Thanks to our unfailing will and the renewed confidence of our shareholders  first and foremost  O1um Capital  we are approaching 2024 with confidence.AJer an in-depth examina1on of several opportuni1es  we iden1fied a unifying and value-crea1ng project in e-health developed by ExactCure. The merger with this company will give Quantum Genomics a new start by responding to the major Public Health challenge of the proper use of medicines and bringing significant and las1ng changes to Health.For our company  the year 2024 will truly begin on April 24  the date of the Annual Ordinary and Extraordinary General Mee1ng  which will be called to decide on the merger that we are considering with ExactCure. I invite our shareholders to par1cipate in this General Mee1ng by vo1ng massively in favor of this project to make their voices heard and to give our company a new ambi1on. »A preserved financial situation to redeploy the company's activityThe results for the 2023 financial year reflect the cessaBon of the development of firibastat and the restructuring period that followed to preserve the company's financial situaBon and  thus  redeploy its acBvity.At the end of December 2023  operaBng income amounted to €36 000 compared to €3.00 million a year earlier. TesBfying to the drasBc restructuring measures implemented  operaBng expenses were significantly reduced and amounted to €3.20 million compared to €33.10 million the previous year. OperaBng profit thus stands at -€3.10 million  compared to -€30.10 million in 2022.AXer taking into account a financial result of -0.03 M€ and an excepBonal result of -0.04 M€  the net result stands at -3.20 M€ as of December 31  2023.At the end of this financial year  the Company's shareholders' equity amounts to €0.43 million  compared to €3.60 million at the end of December 2022. Available cash  which includes a Research Tax Credit of 2. €50 million  is €3.50 million as of December 31  2023  compared to €10.40 million as of December 31  2022. Financial debts amount to €2.72 million and correspond to a PGE taken out with BNPandaBPIR&Dloan.Redeployment of activity in the field of e-healthDuring the 2023 financial year  Quantum Genomics laid the foundaBons for a new business project to drive and create shareholder value. As indicated to the market  the company has held numerous discussions with unlisted HealthTech companies  meeBng specific selecBon criteria: a major field of acBvity  an innovaBve and differenBaBng project  and know-how that can be replicated internaBonally  a high-performance team that complements that of Quantum Genomics.At the end of this process  Quantum Genomics entered into exclusive negoBaBons on December 13  2023  with a view to a merger with ExactCure  a French HealthTech developing a device combining arBficial intelligence and mathemaBcal modeling  making it possible to simulate the behavior that a drug will have when it is taken by the paBent and thus to best adapt the treatment taking  according to the individual characterisBcs of each paBent. This technology  which has a CE mark  is already implemented by major healthcare soluBon providers and iniBally targets pharmaceuBcal laboratories. The resulBng enBty would thus become one of the first Digital Health companies listed on the Euronext Growth market. This project was the subject of a detailed press release on December 14  2023.To successfully complete this merger  Quantum Genomics will submit the operaBons described below to the vote of its shareholders.For this purpose  the Ordinary Annual and Extraordinary General MeeMng will be held on April 24  2024  at 10:00 a.m. at the Cozy MeeMng Center  34 Avenue des Champs-E?lysées  75008 Paris.This MeeBng will notably be called upon to decide on the following operaBons:- the reducMon in the share capital of Quantum Genomics:The share capital of Quantum Genomics would be decreased from 13 935 691.31 euros to 1 393 569.13 euros. The par value of Quantum Genomics shares  which today is around €0.40 (forty euro cents)  would be decreased to around €0.04 (four euro cents).This reducBon would make it possible to parBally offset the losses for the year and the “retained earnings” debt item. It would also facilitate the release of capital during future capital increases of the Company.- the contribuMon in kind of 100% of ExactCure shares:277 031 shares of ExactCure  represenBng the enBrety of the voBng rights and capital of ExactCure  would be contributed to Quantum Genomics for a total contribuBon value of 6 000 000 euros.As remuneraBon for their contribuBons  the contributors would benefit from the issue of 34 854 973 shares of Quantum Genomics for their benefit  to be issued at a unit price of 0.1721418 euros (corresponding to a valuaBon of the Company of 6 000 000 euros). The issue price of the new shares of Quantum Genomics was established based on the implementaBon of the Revalued Net Asset Value (RNAV) method  which is based on the determinaBon of the fair value of the various assets and liabiliBes of the company. This method is also called the “heritage method.” The implementaBon of this method was based in parBcular on (i) thereference to comparable financial transacBons (takeover of a company without acBve operaBonal acBvity  which is listed on the stock exchange) and (ii) other latent assets.The issue price of the new shares of Quantum Genomics shows a premium of approximately 70% compared to the closing share price on March 11  2024.The shareholders of ExactCure and Quantum Genomics signed a contribuBon agreement relaBng to the transacBon on March 12  2024.The report(s) of the contribuBon auditors ruling on the value of the contribuBons in kind and the remuneraBon of the contribuBons will be made available to shareholders on the Quantum Genomics website.As a result of these operaBons  the share capital of Quantum Genomics will be increased to 2 787 137.94 euros divided into 69 709 954 shares. Quantum Genomics shareholders would retain 50% of the Company's capital.Thus  a shareholder of Quantum Genomics with a 1% holding in the capital of Quantum Genomics before the operaBon (based on the share capital of 13 935 691.31 euros divided into 34 854 981 shares) will have a holding of approximately 0.5% of the capital of Quantum Genomics following the contribuBon (based on a share capital of 2 787 137.94 euros divided into 69 709 954 shares).Based on the shareholders' equity as of December 31  2023  the share of shareholders' equity per share which amounted to approximately 0.012 euros prior to the issue of 34 854 973 shares of Quantum Genomics as remuneraBon for the contribuBon  would be approximately 0.092 euro following this issuance  on an undiluted basis.At the end of the contribuBon operaBon  the current directors of ExactCure  Frédéric Dayan  Sylvain Benito  and Fabien AsBc  will respecBvely have 20.21%  9.02%  and 6.86% of Quantum Genomics's capital. OneRagTime will have 8.54% of the capital  and OBum Capital will hold 5.80% of the capital.All the preparatory documents for the April 24 Ordinary and Extraordinary General MeeBng have been made available to shareholders on the Company's website .If the Company's shareholders were to approve the resoluMons which will be submied to their vote  2024 could mark a new start for Quantum Genomics and the start of an innovaMve and value-creaMng project  pu^ng arMficial intelligence to the benefit of challenges public health keys.ContactsQuantum Genomicscontact@quantum-genomics.comValfa Communication (EUROPE)Communication financière et médiasirquantumgenomics@gmail.comThis publication embed ""🔒 Actusnews SECURITY MASTER "".- SECURITY MASTER Key: xWuaaMpulZrIyp5xk8qYnGhlZmdhxJbGmZaVlGSclJ2Zm2xlmpeSl8meZnFlmmxr- Check this key: https://www.security-master-key.com .Regulated information:Inside Information:- News release on accounts  results Full and original press release in PDF: https://www.actusnews.com/news/84575-quantum-genomics-publishes-its-results-for-the-2023-financial-year-en-vdef.pdfReceive by email the next press releases of the company by registering on www.actusnews.com   it's free© 2024 ActusNews",neutral,0.04,0.95,0.01,mixed,0.54,0.31,0.15,True,English,"['Quantum Genomics', '2023 financial year', 'strategic redeployment', 'shareholder vote', 'results', 'merger', 'ExactCure', 'company', 'April', '34 Avenue des Champs-E?lysées', 'major healthcare soluBon providers', 'first Digital Health companies', 'major Public Health challenge', 'Research Tax Credit', 'unlisted HealthTech companies', 'specific selecBon criteria', 'Cozy MeeMng Center', 'Extraordinary General MeeMng', 'drasBc restructuring measures', 'Extraordinary General Mee1ng', 'sustainable business project', 'detailed press release', 'new business project', 'Euronext Growth market', 'annual financial report', 'major field', 'audit report', 'restructuring period', 'French HealthTech', 'new start', 'new ambi1on', 'annual accounts', 'Annual Ordinary', 'Ordinary Annual', 'financial situation', 'financial situaBon', 'financial result', 'Financial debts', 'Quantum Genomics', 'audit procedures', 'Jean-Philippe Milon', 'cash flow', 'supplier debt', 'unfailing will', 'O1um Capital', 'depth examina1on', 'several opportuni1es', 'value-crea1ng project', 'proper use', 'las1ng changes', 'operaBng income', 'operaBng expenses', 'OperaBng profit', 'excepBonal result', 'net result', 'Available cash', 'BNPandaBPIR&Dloan', 'shareholder value', 'numerous discussions', 'differenBaBng project', 'high-performance team', 'exclusive negoBaBons', 'arBficial intelligence', 'mathemaBcal modeling', 'treatment taking', 'individual characterisBcs', 'CE mark', 'pharmaceuBcal laboratories', 'resulBng enBty', 'share capital', 'par value', '2023 financial year', 'previous year', 'annual results', 'strategic redeployment', 'shareholder vote', 'following operaBons', ""shareholders' equity"", 'Paris', 'March', 'merger', 'ExactCure', 'company', 'April', 'ALQGC', 'Board', 'Directors', 'cerBficaBon', 'website', 'December', 'quantum-genomics', 'investors', 'secBon', 'occasion', 'publicaBon', 'Chairman', 'CEO', 'refounda1on', 'workforce', 'confidence', 'unifying', 'medicines', 'significant', 'date', 'favor', 'voices', 'activity', 'cessaBon', 'development', 'firibastat', 'acBvity', 'end', 'AXer', '0.03 M', '4 M', 'PGE', 'foundaBons', 'innovaBve', 'process', 'view', 'device', 'behavior', 'drug', 'paBent', 'technology', 'iniBally', 'subject', 'purpose', '10:00 a', 'MeeBng', 'reducMon', 'euros', '6', '93', '91', '31']",2024-03-13,2024-03-14,marketscreener.com

IMPORTANT - EEA RETAIL INVESTORS If the applicable Final Terms or (in the case of Exempt Notes) Pricing Supplement in respect of any Notes includes a legend entitled ""Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors""  such Notes 0087518-0000088 UKO2: 2007245996.10 5are not intended to be offered  sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes  a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (the Insurance Distribution Directive)  where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Regulation. Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No. 1286/2014 (as amended) (the PRIIPs Regulation) for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

A determination will be made in relation to each issue about whether  for the purpose of the UK MiFIR Product Governance Rules  any Dealer subscribing for any Notes is a manufacturer in respect of such Notes  but otherwise neither the Arranger nor the Dealers nor any of their respective affiliates will be a manufacturer for the purpose of the UK MIFIR Product Governance Rules. BENCHMARKS REGULATION Interest and/or other amounts payable under the Notes may be calculated by reference to certain reference rates. Any such reference rate may constitute a benchmark for the purposes of Regulation (EU) 2016/1011 (the Benchmarks Regulation).

Transitional provisions in the Benchmarks Regulation may have the result that the administrator of a particular benchmark is not required to appear in the register of administrators and benchmarks at the date of the applicable Final Terms or (in the case of Exempt Notes) Pricing Supplement. The registration status of any administrator under the Benchmarks Regulation is a matter of public record and  save where required by applicable law  the Issuer does not intend to update the applicable Final Terms or (in the case of Exempt Notes) Pricing Supplement to reflect any change in the registration status of the administrator.

The Issuer will make a determination in relation to each issue about the classification of the Notes being offered for purposes of section 309B(1)(a) of the SFA. Any such legend included on the applicable Final Terms (or Pricing Supplement  as the case may be) will constitute notice to ""relevant persons"" for purposes of section 309B(1)(c) of the SFA.

Further details on the webcast will be sent shortly.“Nicox is focusing its resources on the Denali Phase 3 pivotal trial of its lead asset NCX 470 in glaucoma. This trial  which we are conducting with our long-term Chinese partner Ocumension Therapeutics  is on track with 80% of the target number of patients already randomized. We expect topline results in H2 2025 and expect that these will be supportive of future regulatory approval and partnering in the U.S. and other territories. We are reducing costs  including the size of the organization  and are exploring advancing NCX 1728  through collaborations. Our licensed  marketed products  VYZULTA and ZERVIATE  are generating royalty revenues for Nicox. With an experienced team delivering on the Denali trial  we are also focused on putting financing in place to complete the debt restructuring and to deliver on the promise of our innovative treatment NCX 470 ” said Gavin Spencer  Chief Executive Officer of Nicox. “We maintain constructive relationships with potential licensing and strategic partners for NCX 470 in the U.S and other territories outside of those already partnered and continue to update them on the status.”Update on Development PipelineNCX 470  our lead clinical asset  is a novel nitric oxide-donating bimatoprost eye drop. The Denali Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating NCX 470 for the lowering of intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension  being conducted in the U.S. and China  is on track to generate topline results in H2 2025. 80% of the target number of patients have been randomized in the trial and completion of recruitment of U.S. patients is expected in Q4 2024. Supportive development data required for the preparation of the U.S. New Drug Application (NDA) is expected to be available on or before the completion of the Denali trial. The database from the trial will not be locked until after the last patient has completed their final trial visit in China  which drives the timing of the Denali results.The Whistler Phase 3b trial investigating the dual mechanism of action of NCX 470 in IOP lowering is underway and results are expected in Q1 2025. The Phase 3b optical coherence tomography (OCT) trial to investigate the potential benefits of NCX 470 on the retina is not included in the current plan  however this development will be revisited when finances allow. Neither of the two Phase 3b trials are required for an NDA submission in either the U.S. or China. The potential of NCX 470 has been validated by our established partnerships with Ocumension and more recently with Kowa  for China and Japan respectively. With the completion of the Denali trial  Nicox expects to be in a position to partner NCX 470 for commercialization in the U.S. and potentially other territories. Mont Blanc and Denali trials have been designed to fulfill the regulatory requirements for safety and efficacy Phase 3 trials to support NDA submissions in both the U.S. and in China  where NCX 470 is exclusively licensed to Ocumension.NCX 1 728  an NO-donating phosphodiesterase-5 (NO-PDE5) inhibitor  is a preclinical asset with potential for development in retinal conditions. The United States Patent Office (USPTO) recently issued the Notice of Allowance for the patent covering NO-PDE5 inhibitors including NCX1728  with an expiry date in 2039. Nonclinical data have demonstrated potential for the development of NCX 1728 in a number of ophthalmic conditions and we are exploring continuing the development of this product candidate through partnerships.NCX 4251  a novel suspension of fluticasone propionate nanocrystals  is at development stage for dry eye disease. The Company has agreed a development plan with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for a Phase 3 program in dry eye disease  and this asset is available for partnering outside China. NCX 4251 is licensed to Ocumension in China who are currently reviewing the pharmaceutical development activities which would be needed to enter in clinical trials in China.Update on Revenue Generating ProductsHistorically  Nicox has been generating and reporting royalty revenues from the sales of its products by its partners  primarily Bausch + Lomb for the commercialization of VYZULTA®  and from upfront and milestone payments from its licensing agreements. We expect to add to this the royalty revenue from Ocumension from the commercialization of ZERVIATE® in China this year and  in the future  from the commercialization of NCX 470 by Ocumension and Kowa  by its future partners in the U.S. and potentially other territories. Nicox estimates annual global net sales of NCX 470 could be over $300 million1 within 8 years of the date of launches in the U.S. and China.VYZULTA – Nicox continues to receive royalties on net sales of VYZULTA. Bausch + Lomb  exclusive worldwide partner of Nicox  reported 35% revenue growth for VYZULTA in 2023. VYZULTA is commercialized by Bausch + Lomb in more than 15 countries and territories  including the U.S.  and is also approved in a number of other countries. VYZULTA is indicated for the reduction of IOP in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension.ZERVIATE – Our forecasts assume that the majority of the ZERVIATE revenue will come from the sales of ZERVIATE in China by our exclusive Chinese partner Ocumension. ZERVIATE is expected to be approved in China shortly  following submission of the NDA there in April 2023. Ocumension forecasts peak annual net sales of over $100 million within 7 years of launch in China. ZERVIATE is also currently commercialized in the U.S. for ocular itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis by Harrow  Inc. In January 2024  Nicox expanded the territory of the exclusive licensing agreement with Harrow  Inc.  to include Canada. No payment was associated with the extension of the territory  and Nicox would receive royalties on any net sales of ZERVIATE in Canada. ZERVIATE forms part of Harrow’s recent agreement with Apotex for Canada.Update on Cash RunwayThe Company is financed to at least November 2024  based on focusing exclusively on the development of NCX 470. The Company is pursuing business development discussions  including the sale or license of certain assets  and exploring multiple strategic options which could further extend the cash runway. The Company is evaluating all options for financing and will use the most appropriate at the time.As of February 28  2024  Nicox had a total amount of debt2 of €18.2 million consisting of €16.9 million debt outstanding from Kreos Capital VI (UK) Limited (an affiliate of BlackRock) and a €1.3 million of non-dilutive loan facility credit agreement guaranteed by the French state related to the COVID-19 pandemic.About NicoxNicox SA is an international ophthalmology company developing innovative solutions to help maintain vision and improve ocular health. Nicox’s lead program in clinical development is NCX 470  a novel nitric oxide-donating bimatoprost eye drop  for lowering intraocular pressure in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. Nicox generates revenue from VYZULTA® in glaucoma  licensed exclusively worldwide to Bausch + Lomb  and ZERVIATE® in allergic conjunctivitis  licensed in multiple geographies  including to Harrow  Inc. in the U.S.  and Ocumension Therapeutics in the Chinese and in the majority of Southeast Asian markets.Nicox  headquartered in Sophia Antipolis  France  is listed on Euronext Growth Paris (Ticker symbol: ALCOX) and is part of the CAC Healthcare index.For more information www.nicox.com.Analyst coverageBryan  Garnier & Co Eric Yoo Paris  FranceH.C.

In order to participate to the conference call  please register at the following link: https://register.vevent.com/register/BI334d62953abb41cea27de99dc5da974c .The live webcast will be available here and on the “ Investor Presentations ” page of the Inventiva website  with the recording and presentation available following the event.About LEGENDThe LEGEND ( L anifibranor in combination with the SGLT2 inhibitor e mpa g liflozin in pati e nts with NASH and type 2 d iabetes) trial has been designed as a multi-center  randomized  24-week treatment  placebo-controlled Phase IIa trial to assess the safety and efficacy of lanifibranor in combination with the SGLT2 inhibitor empagliflozin for the treatment of patients with non-cirrhotic MASH/NASH and T2D. The diagnosis of non-cirrhotic MASH/NASH is based on historic histology evaluation or a combination of non-invasive methods including diagnostic methods including imaging. The trial is double-blind for the placebo and lanifibranor arms and open-label for the combination of lanifibranor and empagliflozin arm. The results presented concern a pre-specified interim analysis on the first half of randomized patients  who have either completed the 24-week treatment period or prematurely discontinued from treatment earlier. The primary efficacy endpoint of the trial is the absolute change in Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) at week 24 compared to baseline. Secondary endpoints include changes in liver enzymes  markers of glucose and lipid metabolism  MRI-PDFF  markers of inflammation and fibrosis  body weight evolution and body fat composition.About lanifibranorLanifibranor  Inventiva’s lead product candidate  is an orally-available small molecule that acts to induce antifibrotic  anti-inflammatory and beneficial vascular and metabolic changes in the body by activating all three peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (“PPAR”) isoforms  which are well-characterized nuclear receptor proteins that regulate gene expression. Lanifibranor is a PPAR agonist that is designed to target all three PPAR isoforms in a moderately potent manner  with a well-balanced activation of PPARα and PPARδ  and a partial activation of PPARγ. While there are other PPAR agonists that target only one or two PPAR isoforms for activation  lanifibranor is the only pan-PPAR agonist in clinical development for the treatment of MASH/NASH. Inventiva believes that lanifibranor’s moderate and balanced pan-PPAR binding profile contributes to the favorable tolerability profile that has been observed in clinical trials and pre-clinical studies to date. The FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy and Fast Track designation to lanifibranor for the treatment of MASH/NASH.About InventivaInventiva is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the research and development of oral small molecule therapies for the treatment of patients with MASH/NASH  mucopolysaccharidoses (“MPS”) and other diseases with significant unmet medical need. The Company benefits from a strong expertise and experience in the domain of compounds targeting nuclear receptors  transcription factors and epigenetic modulation. Inventiva is currently advancing one clinical candidate  has a pipeline of two preclinical programs and continues to explore other development opportunities to add to its pipeline.Inventiva’s lead product candidate  lanifibranor  is currently in a pivotal Phase III clinical trial  NATiV3  for the treatment of adult patients with MASH/NASH  a common and progressive chronic liver disease for which there are currently no approved therapies.Inventiva’s pipeline also includes odiparcil  a drug candidate for the treatment of adult MPS VI patients. As part of Inventiva’s decision to focus clinical efforts on the development of lanifibranor  it suspended its clinical efforts relating to odiparcil and is reviewing available options with respect to its potential further development. Inventiva is also in the process of selecting a candidate for its Hippo signaling pathway program.The Company has a scientific team of approximately 90 people with deep expertise in the fields of biology  medicinal and computational chemistry  pharmacokinetics and pharmacology  and clinical development.

The partnership includes Eviden  the Atos Group business leading in advanced computing  A*STAR’s Institute of High Performance Computing (IHPC) in Singapore  and MajuLab  an international research laboratory in quantum physics. Majulab is a joint laboratory of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)  Université Côte d’Azur (UCA)  Sorbonne University (SU)  National University of Singapore (NUS) and Nanyang Technological University (NTU).In the context of conventional high-performance computing (HPC) environments  energy optimizations are generally achieved through improved hardware architectures and better cooling systems. However new approaches must be set up to optimize energetic consumption in future quantum computers.Quantum computing leverages fundamental science to solve complex problems much more efficiently than classical methods: this is known as the quantum computational advantage. While the age of large-scale  fault-tolerant quantum computing seems years away  Noisy-Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices are already a reality. In such devices  the energy cost to solve a problem on quantum devices could be much less than solving the same problem on a classical HPC system. This offers the possibility that the energy advantage of quantum algorithms may be established before quantum the computational advantage itself.This research collaboration aims to build a user-friendly framework for accurate benchmarking of energy efficiency in NISQ/near-term quantum computing systems. This framework is based on a novel holistic methodology recently proposed by one of the partners1  to estimate and optimize energy consumption for the full stack of the quantum computer.The three partners will conduct research on various options to estimate the performance and energy consumption of various algorithms  supported by Eviden’s quantum emulator Qaptiva 800  which can emulate over 100 qubits depending on the algorithm and emulator used. The collaboration will rely on three main work groups: control parameters and energy benchmarking metric; implementation of resource monitoring within Eviden’s quantum emulation environment; and application-based benchmarking (VQE).Dr. Cédric Bourrasset  Global Head of HPC-AI and Quantum Computing  Eviden  Atos Group  said “While the power for computing keeps increasing  our commitment to decarbonization and sustainability hasn’t diminished. For decades  Eviden has been committed to greener technologies  leading the HPC market with its patented Direct Liquid Cooling. The Group is as equally committed to promoting a greener quantum computing  which we know will be at the heart of computing technologies in the coming years.”Dr. Su Yi  Executive Director  A*STAR’s IHPC  said “Sustainable computing is closely tied to the potential of quantum computing where near-term quantum algorithms offer energy-efficiency and problem-solving potential that could drive quantum technology adoption. A*STAR’s Institute of High Performance Computing (IHPC) is working together with our research partners to advance this intersection of sustainability and quantum technologies.”Alexia Auffèves  CNRS Research Director  = Director of the MajuLab  and Co-founder of the Quantum Energy Initiative  said “The collaboration is aligned with the objectives of the recently launched Quantum Energy Initiative  which aims to keep in check the energy footprint of quantum technologies already at their early stage. It will contribute to set up solid  objectives and figures of merit to really assess if quantum energy advantages can be reached. This kind of work is essential to mitigate the risk of green quantum hype. It directly relates to the new QEI working group P3329 at IEEE  which is currently developing a standard of energy efficiency.”***About Eviden2Eviden is a next-gen technology leader in data-driven  trusted and sustainable digital transformation with a strong portfolio of patented technologies.

RESULTS BY OPERATING SEGMENT During the first half of the current fiscal year  Digital Bros implemented a strategic review of its operations in accordance with the latest market conditions  reviewing its pipeline and organizational structure accordingly. Releasing new games in the current market is more challenging than ever before  consumers are tending to play the same games for longer  rather than spending time on new and different gaming experiences  further attracting gamers to new releases requires greater investments in marketing than in the past. Following the optimism resulting from the growth achieved across the whole video game industry during the pandemic  the Group implemented a significant investment plan  in line with most of its competitors. In 2023  a record number of new video games were launched within a very competitive marketplace  making it harder to meet the expected volume and revenue targets  requiring the Group to review its publishing strategy. The review of the Group's pipeline was based upon the expected return on investment of each title  prioritizing high margin titles with greater revenue predictability  as well as owned Intellectual Properties to leverage on their long- term value creation for the Group. As a result  the Group reduced a number of lower budgets projects but also some larger budget titles with lower expected margins for the Group and with longer development periods  such as the new releases within the Control franchise. Due to the reduction of the overall number of titles  the Group reduced its workforce accordingly. This reduction also reflects the lower number of staff required by the internal studios after the launch of Crime Boss Rockay City and Puzzle Quest 3  which have both transitioned to their live support phase. The reorganization plan started in the second quarter of FY24  with some additional impact expected in Q3. The restructure will deliver improved profit margin for the Group within the fourth quarter of the current fiscal year and will ensure the long-term sustainability of the Group's structure. The Group's total workforce went from 435 people as of June 30th  2023  to 376 as of December 31st  2023. The total cost of the restructuring plan as of December 31st  2023  amounted to Euro 846 thousand  which is expected to be fully offset by the savings that the Group expects to achieve within the current fiscal year. At the end of February 2024  the total number of employees further decreased to 311. 2The Group's revenue amounted to Euro 47.1 million  down by 21.2% compared to the same reporting period of FY23  when the total revenue amounted to Euro 59.8 million  with Ghostrunner 2 as the only new release in the reporting period. The net revenue for the Premium Games operating sector as of December 31st  2023 was at Euro 35.9 million  representing 76.1% of total revenue  in line with the first half of FY23. This was spread across different intellectual properties  with the outstanding performance of the different versions of Assetto Corsa. The franchise developed by the fully owned studio Kunos Simulazioni generated Euro 12.2 million revenue in the reporting period. The revenue from international markets accounted for 96% of total net revenue  while digital sales amounted to 90% of the total net revenue  in line with the same reporting period in FY23.

The terms of the Directors and the Statutory Auditors will expire on the Shareholders' Meeting which will approve the financial statements as of June 30th  2026. On November 14th  2023  having reconsidered the number of projects under development to adapt to the new competitive scenario  the Group announced an organizational review  which will result in the reduction of approximately 30% of its global workforce. Such reduction will predominantly be concentrated within its development studios and  to a lesser extent  across its publishing units  both Premium and Free to Play. 4SIGNIFICANT EVENTS OCCURRED AFTER DECEMBER 31ST  2023 On February 28th  2024  505 Games S.p.A. entered into an agreement with Remedy Entertainment to revert all publishing  distribution  and marketing rights related to the Control franchise to the Finnish developer  for a total repayment of minimum Euro 15.7 million  with a potential minor premium. This amount corresponds to the investment made to date by 505 Games for the development of the video games Condor and Control 2. 505 Games will continue as the exclusive publisher of Control until December 31st  2024  executing the existing sublicensing deals under their original terms. BUSINESS OUTLOOK The Group's release schedule for the second half of this fiscal year includes: the launch of the Season 2024 pack for Assetto Corsa Competizione on April 1st  2024. The official video game for the Fanatec GT World Challenge championship will feature the iconic Nürburgring Nordscheifle circuit for the first time;the launch of the new video game Eiyuden Chronicle - Hundred Heroes on April 23 rd   for consoles  PC and the Microsoft Game Pass subscription platform;  for consoles  PC and the Microsoft Game Pass subscription platform; the release of the Steam version of Crime Boss: Rockay City  in June 2024. No significant launches are expected in the Free to Play operating segment  which achieved good levels of revenue and margin following the acquisition of 505 Go Inc.. The focus for this operating segment is on extending the lifecycle of existing games  by improving their features and functionality. The positive business outlook for the second half of FY24 will allow Digital Bros to achieve increased revenue at fiscal year-end and EBIT margin in line with the levels achieved at the end of FY23  benefitting from the new releases and lower payroll costs  especially from the last quarter onwards. The new releases are expected to be launched well ahead of the fiscal year-end  allowing for better visibility of our full year revenue and margins  unlike last year. The Group is decreasing its level of investment expected in the second half of the current fiscal year  especially after having reverted the rights related to the Control franchise in February. Such reduction  together with the expected increase in sales  should lead to a significant improvement of the net financial position. At the end of FY24  the net financial position is expected to be at the same level as of June 30th  2023. ART  154-BIS OF THE T.U.F. As required by paragraph 2  Art. 154-bis of the T.U.F.

At this stage  the Company is not in a position to assess the potential impact on its business and financial condition linked to the uncertainties created by the current situation.Denis Ladegaillerie  Founder and CEO said: “Believe is posting today healthy results  fully in line with expectations.

The Group gained additional market share in most key markets and positioned among top 3 players for local acts in many European and Asian markets. This solid performance resulted in an Adjusted organic growth of +19.5% in FY’23.Believe’s strength is its presence across 50 countries around the world with local teams on the ground who are fully part of the local music scenes and thus able to identify local artists and labels with the best potential to partner with and to accompany them at best in their development. The goal is to provide artists  regardless of their level of development  with the highest level of digital service quality in the market thanks to a unique tech-enabled approach and by leveraging globally the solutions developed centrally. The Group therefore resumed its investment in local and central teams in H2’23 after lowering their level in H1’23 to adapt to a more challenging economic environment. Believe’s focus on the quality of service resulted in strong commercial dynamism throughout FY’23  both in terms of renewals and new signings. Believe’s appeal to artists and labels increased in a wider variety of music genres thanks to their ongoing digitalization  which also supports the Group’s commercial success.Proven capacity of Premium Solutions in artist development from emerging to top charting talents in European countriesIn France  Believe proved its capacity to develop artists at the top of the market in several genres  as well as to nurture emerging talents  with 5 debut albums in the Top200. Believe ranked #1 on local acts in FY’23  with a 29% market share for the Top200 thanks to a strong presence both in new albums and tracks  and in catalog. The Group had 42 albums in the Top200 (physical + digital according to SNEP data). Several artists of the roster confirmed their high level of success during the year  further building Believe’s strength in French local repertoire  including WeRenoi  JUL  Yamê  Nej or Djadja & Dinaz.In Germany  Believe ranked 48 singles in the Top100 and achieved three times number one ranking during the year. The launch of B-electronic (electro / dance) and Madizin (schlager / pop)  respectively late 2022 and early 2023  allowed the Group to further diversify its roster in the country. Believe also renewed several local rap acts  including Raf Camora  the most streamed artist of FY’23 in Germany.In the UK  where the Group holds an emerging position  Believe witnessed a surge in the consumption of its roster with more than 35 billion streams during the year. The Believe UK team also won the Best Label/Artist Services at the Music Week Awards 2023 in H1’23  a true testament to the quality of service in digital.In Spain  the success of Iñigo Quintero’s viral hit ‘Si No Estás’  which is the first global #1 track for Believe  illustrated the growing digitalization of artist development and the strength of the Group’s expertise in this field. The key to success there has been a great partnership with the artist  his label and Believe’s key DSP partners  combined with Believe’s unique ability to combine strong AI data-driven expertise to maximize the momentum for an artist’s track at the right time with the right tools  supported by both local and global teams.The Group was also very active in Eastern Europe with a solid pipeline of new signings in FY’23. Believe has notably partnered with Azariah  the current top artist in Hungary and supported him in reaching new heights from being an Indie YouTube artist to becoming the biggest pop singer & songwriter in the country. The Group also developed its rap imprint in Romania and in Poland enabling artists like Rava  Guzior or Kaz Balagane to become top charting artists in Q4’23.Further building up leadership in Asia where the Group celebrated its first decade in 2023Believe’s Group has played a central role in the structuring of Asia Pacific’s music market. With over 10 000 labels & artists3 signed across in Asia Pacific excluding Japan in the past decade  Believe has paid more than €700 million in royalties back to the local music industry4  further fueling the growth of a sustainable local music ecosystem by fostering new artist development  funding the launch of new labels and exploring new genres of music and addressing new audiences. Such impact was strengthened by Believe’s continuous effort to invest in and nurture a new generation of music executives and digital experts  being one of the first companies to sign deals with local digital music services and supporting its international digital music partners as they rolled out their services in the region. In the last four years alone  Believe APAC has grown around twice the market growth  thus contributing to substantially strengthening an increasing local content market share.5Believe continued its expansion in Asia in H2’23. First  by building additional capabilities in Greater China  where the Group received 5 awards for Chinese rapper Capper from NetEase Cloud Music at the NetEase Annual Music Awards. Believe also launched its full offering in Japan where it only operated TuneCore so far  as the market undergoes an increased digitalization of local music genres. Believe also launched early 2024 PlayCode a new imprint dedicated to the Japanese hip-hop scene and signed 3 artists: ¥ellow Bucks  Red Eye and Issei Uno Fifth.The Group also further expanded its leadership in India in December 2023 with a new investment in the country’s largest digital music market segment  aka original soundtracks. Believe acquired White Hill Music’s premium Punjabi music catalog  a partner since 2017  including songs from active top and established artists from Northern India  such as Maninder Buttar  Gurnam Bhullar  Ninja  Nimrat Khaira  R Nait  Shivjot  Akhil  Happy Raikoti  who all have millions of listenership on YouTube and Spotify. Believe also acquired the existing YouTube channel  which has a strong 23.4 million subscriber base and will be used to promote the back-catalog and the new artists signed with Believe Artist Services.Launching new marketing program to position TuneCore (Automated Solutions segment) as a development engine for self-releasing artistsTuneCore Accelerator is a powerhouse marketing program designed to drive discovery of music  expand audiences  and promote deeper fan engagement. The program leverages industry-leading services powered by Believe’s technology  TuneCore’s marketing program  and innovative products. By integrating the program  artists gain access to an arsenal of industry-leading services and technologies and get greater support to reach their next development phase.In Q4’23  the first quarter following TuneCore Accelerator’s launch  nearly 10 000 artists increased their streams by an average of 143% compared to the previous quarter and most of them were able to enter a higher market segment. This represents about 1 in 8 artists who have been enrolled in the program since its launch. Building on these early positive results  TuneCore Accelerator will be expanded to enable even more self-releasing artists to grow.Confirming Believe’s commitment to foster healthy and fair music ecosystem to further Shape Music for GoodBelieve completed its third global employee satisfaction survey Your Voice. The participation rate was up to 81%  2 points higher than the previous survey and the global eNPS (employee Net Promoter Score) increased by 7 points compared to last year. Talent is key and at the heart of the Group’s model and strategy  which led Believe to roll out several actions to increase employee satisfaction over the course of the year.In the meantime  the Group pursued its focus on gender diversity and developing talent internally and witnessed a progression in all criteria retained in the CEO variable compensation:Gender diversity: 45.6% of women among employees.Training rate: 94.4% (in average  11 hours of training per employee).eNPS: 15 (steep increases versus last year’s level).Believe pursued its pivotal role in fighting against streaming fraud by taking a leadership role as a founding member of the Music Fights Fraud  by welcoming Spotify new model and decision to penalize fraud more strictly than in the past  by investing in new detection technologies and by reinforcing the education provided to artists and labels on the matter.The Group also pursued its efforts to support greater diversity in the music industry and just released the results of its fourth annual study BE THE CHANGE: Gender Equity in Music. Part of Shaping Music for Good program  BE THE CHANGE has become a key milestone to assess the challenges faced by female and gender expansive creators and music professionals globally.FY 2023 FINANCIALSAdjusted organic growth of +19.5% reflecting the anticipated recovery in growth rates witnessed in Q4’23FY’23 revenues grew by +15.7% to reach €880.3 million  reflecting an organic growth of +14.4%. Digital sales increased by +13.0% in FY’23  reflecting solid underlying trends and negative currency headwinds affecting royalties collected and reversed by DSPs. Adjusted from this negative embedded market FX effect  revenues grew by +19.5%. The change in perimeter related mainly to the integration of Sentric contributed for +2.6% to revenue growth but was partially offset by a negative forex impact mostly driven by the Turkish lira and the US dollar (-1.4%). Sentric contribution has been accounted for in non-digital sales  which therefore grew by almost +50% in FY’23.After reaching a low point in Q3’23  digital monetization started recovering in Q4’23 thanks to a combined impact of reduced market currency headwinds and improved comparison base in ad-funded streaming. Consequently  Believe recorded revenue growth of +18.1% in Q4’23  reflecting an adjusted organic growth of +21.8%.Premium Solutions driving organic growth  revenue growth of Automated Solutions enhanced by SentricDigital Music Sales6 (DMS) exceeded €1.2 billion in FY’23  reflecting double digit growth in Premium Solutions. DMS in Automated Solutions were affected by the strengthening of the euro versus the dollar.Premium Solutions revenues amounted to €825.1 million  an increase of +15.8%  mainly organically driven (organic growth of +14.7%). Adjusted from the negative embedded market FX in digital monetization  organic growth was above +20%. As anticipated  Q4’23 witnessed a solid improvement in digital versus the previous quarter. Paid streaming benefitted from price increases by several large DSPs and market share gains remained solid  while ad-funded streaming improved and currency headwinds affecting digital sales were reduced. Believe further demonstrated its capacity to enable labels to outperform their own market and supported artist development in a wider variety of music genres. Non-digital sales were particularly strong in the last quarter  reflecting the integration of Sentric  strong live activities in France and branding operations in Turkey.Automated Solutions revenues amounted to €55.2 million up by +14.6% in FY’23  reflecting organic growth of +9.9%  a negative forex impact related to the dollar of -2.9% and a perimeter effect related to the integration of Sentric self-served activities of +7.6%. The negative forex impact intensified in Q4’23  affecting digital monetization. The new marketing program TuneCore Accelerator was successfully launched at the end of the year  started contributing to Digital Music Sales in Q4’23 and will contribute to TuneCore’s revenue this year. TuneCore also increased the pricing of its paid subscription plans in December 2023  which will contribute to revenue growth in FY’24. Sentric is accounted for in non-digital sales  which therefore grew significantly since its acquisition. Non-digital sales were also significantly enhanced by a catch-up in TuneCore’s own publishing business in Q4’23. TuneCore was already offering a set of publishing services before Sentric’s acquisition.Strong growth in most geographiesin € million FY 2022 FY 2023 Change YoY Europe (excl. France & Germany) 210.2 264.6 +25.9% Americas 109.2 128.1 +17.4% APAC / Africa 199.3 228.9 +14.9% France 128.6 147.8 +14.9% Germany 113.6 110.9 -2.4% Total 760.8 880.3 +15.7%Revenue growth amounted to +25.9% in Europe (excluding France and Germany) and represented 30.1% of total revenues in FY’23. Revenue growth was uplifted by the integration of Sentric  which was primarily present in the UK. Believe remained on a strong growth trajectory in Southern Europe and Eastern Europe. Digital monetization was affected by currency headwinds notably in the UK but was globally well oriented during the year in the whole region. The level of activity remained particularly sustained in Turkey  including its branding activities.Americas grew by +17.4% and represented 14.6% of Group revenues. The level of activity in Brazil and Mexico was strong throughout the year  showcasing the Group’s success in the Latin American music. In the US  which is led by TuneCore business  the Group recorded strong growth after a slight improvement in the first nine months of the year. Revenues were already affected by the weakening of the dollar versus the euro.In FY’23  revenue growth reached +14.9% in Asia Pacific and Africa  which represented 26.0% of Group revenues. The performance was affected over the course of the year by currency headwinds embedded in digital market monetization and by depressed ad-funded streaming. The Group pursued its strategy to build up a leader in Asia and its previous investment enabled additional market share gains across the region. The level of activity was particularly strong in Greater China and Japan. India and Southeast Asia grew at a slower pace  as revenues in those markets are more exposed to ad-funded streaming.In France  revenues increased by +14.9% in FY’23 and represented 16.8% of Group revenues. After growing by c. 8% in the first nine months  Believe recorded very strong growth in Q4’23 thanks to a strong calendar of new releases and higher live music activities. Believe is now well-established among the top 3 players for local acts and its performance became more influenced by the release calendar of top acts. Believe also confirmed its leadership in rap music and continued diversifying its roster during the year.In Germany  revenues were down -2.4% in FY’23 and represented 12.6% of Group revenues. Digital sales returned to healthy growth in Q4’23 after a solid H1’23 performance and temporary slowdown in Q3’23. The growth is driven by the strong positioning on local acts and was also supported by the ongoing diversification of music genres in the roster. Non-digital sales further declined as the Group accelerated its exit from contracts that were too heavy in physical sales and merchandising.Delivering profitable growth as demonstrated by the solid increase in Adjusted EBITDA marginBelieve also focused on improving efficiency during the year  carefully managing its investment cycles.Adjusted EBITDA pre-Central Platform costs7 grew by +19.0% in FY’23 to reach €128.4 million (versus €107.9 million in FY’22). In Premium Solutions  the Group resumed investment in local teams in H2’23 at a higher pace than in H1’23 as revenue ramp up was clearer and added sales and marketing capabilities in Europe and Asia. The Group also expanded operations in Greater China and opened new offices in Japan. In Automated Solutions  the Group introduced new features and developed a new marketing program to support the development of self-released artists. As a result  sales & marketing at the segment level increased year-over-year with an acceleration in H2’23. Adjusted EBITDA margin pre-Central Platform reached 14.6%  an increase of 40bps compared with FY’22. This margin included growth investments in both segments  which represented 3.0% of total revenues excluding Sentric in FY’23 (vs 4.9% in FY’22).Central Platform costs (€78.1 million in FY’23 versus €73.2 million in FY’22) increased by +6.8% year-over-year  and further decreased over revenue  representing 8.9% in FY’23 compared with 9.6% in FY’22. Efficiency plans enabled the Group to optimize its investments in the Central Platform over the course of the year. The Group pursued its investment in data analysis  digital marketing and AI-backed tools for discovery and audience development  but also postponed secondary projects. Better amortization of the Central Platform provided significant operating leverage in FY’23 as in previous years.As usual some Central Platform investments are capitalized under IFRS accounting principles. In FY’23  total investment (P&L and capitalized costs) in the Central Platform amounted to €91.6 million. Total investment went up +3.1% year-over-year and represented 10.4% of total Group revenues compared with 11.7% in FY’22.The Group’s Adjusted EBITDA increased by c. +45% year-over-year to reach €50.3 million in FY’23 compared with €34.7 million in FY’22. Adjusted EBITDA margin amounted to 5.7% compared with 4.6% in FY’22. This increase of 110bps resulted from the improved profitability of the segment and better amortization of Central Platform costs. Believe was steadily during the year at its mid-term objective level (Group adjusted EBITDA margin of 5% to 7% by 2025).Operating income (EBIT) - Depreciation & Amortization amounted to €61.3 million in FY’23  a steep increase compared with last year (+36.7%)  as acquisitions resumed in H1’23 with that of Sentric in March. The Group also made some investment in catalog  including notably the acquisition of White Hill Music in December. The Adjusted EBITDA improvement partially offset the increase in Depreciation & Amortization  enabling a loss reduction at the EBIT level compared with last year.Free cash flow reflecting commercial dynamism and solid cash level at the end of December’23Working capital variation remained negative by €23.7 million for the full year but witnessed some improvement in H2’23 as anticipated. Believe had additional attractive commercial opportunities to renew and sign artists and labels and provided additional financing through advances in H2’23. There has been less request to sign on much longer terms than usual as this was the case in Q2’23. The increase in advances was therefore limited in the second half and amounted to €81.2 million in FY’23. The current activity enabled the Group to extract cash from the working capital in FY’23  further compensating for the elevated level of artists and label advances.Capitalized development costs were in line with previous years and amounted to €17.9 million on a full year basis (2% of Group revenues).Free cash flow was negative by just €3.1 million in FY’23  mostly due to negative working capital variation.Cash on the balance sheet amounted to €214.2 million at the end of December’23 compared to €303.3 million at the end of December’22  mostly reflecting the acquisition of Sentric  catalog acquisitions including White Hill Music’s catalog and higher artist and label advances.FY’24 OUTLOOK AND MID-TERM OBJECTIVESIn FY’24  the Group will continue to drive a profitable growth trajectory towards its long-term profitability objective of 15% Adjusted EBITDA margin.The revenue growth scenario implies solid paid streaming trends  which will combine new subscribers and price increases at some DSPs and a progressive recovery of ad-funded streaming. Ad-funded streaming is not anticipated to recover in emerging markets before the second half of the year. The growth scenario also implies additional market share gains across regions  and notably in countries where the Group is not yet ranking in the Top 3 for local acts. Believe also anticipates an improved currency environment for digital monetization. The Group assumes that the negative embedded market FX effect will amount to -2%  compared with -5.1% in FY’23. Consequently  Believe expects Adjusted Organic growth of c. +20% in FY’24. Organic growth is expected in Q1’24 to be below Q4’23 rate  which benefited from a very strong level of live and branding activities and should accelerate from Q2’24.The Group will continue to adapt the investment cycle to market growth and will therefore size its investment in each key market. Believe will also continue to optimize investments in the Central Platform and increase efficiency through automatization. The Group will further focus on efficiency during the year  but margin improvement will be lower than in FY’23 due to the higher level of Tech & Product spending. As a result  the Group anticipates an Adjusted EBITDA margin of c. 6.5%.Believe notes that it is the object of ongoing discussions around a potential change of control of the Group. At this stage  the Company is not in a position to assess the potential impact on its business and financial condition of the uncertainty created by the current situation.The Group will continue to allocate cash between advances and acquisitions in the next months. Believe’s reinforced appeal to a greater number of artists and labels in a wider variety of music genres and the ongoing industry consolidation provide more attractive opportunities for the Group  which will therefore allocate more cash to internal and external investments going forward.The Group is on track to deliver on its medium-term trajectory communicated at the IPO  including a 2021-2025 CAGR of between +22% and +25% and a Group Adjusted EBITDA of 5%-7% by 2025  implying a segment Adjusted EBITDA margin of 15%-16% (which is a ""high growth period"" margin  as the revenue growth is partially reinvested). Believe reiterates its confidence in its ability to achieve its long-term target of at least 15% Group Adjusted EBITDA margin.The annual financial statements are available on our investor website: Investors | BelieveWebcast:We will host a webcast https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/xj8rrbby and conference call starting at 6:30 p.m. CET (5:30 p.m. GMT) today.

Thanks to the development of the business  a careful control of structural costs  we achieved an adjusted EBITDA of more than EUR 20 million  approaching EUR 21 million  a level we have not reached since the pre-Covidera. Despite the particularly challenging macroeconomic environment in early 2024  the company remains confident about its medium- to long-termgrowth targets. 1The term 'ordinary' is used in accordance with stock exchange practice Adjusted EBITDA is calculated as EBITDA adjusted for: i ) non-recurring costs/(income)  ii ) effects of non-recurring events  iii ) events relating to extraordinary transactions and iv ) operating foreign exchange gains/(losses). Adjusted Net Result is calculated as the Financial Year Result  adjusted for: i) adjustments incorporated in Adjusted EBITDA  ii) adjustments of amortisation relating to the Purchase Price Allocation  iii) adjustments of non-recurring financial costs/(income) and iv) the theoretical tax impact of these adjustments. Leverage ratio is the ratio of net financial indebtedness to Adjusted EBITDA. 1. Analysis of consolidated revenue In FY 2023  the Group realised Sales Revenues of EUR 158.6 million  an increase of 15.3% compared to the previous year (EUR 137.6 million)  thanks to the positive contribution of the most important product lines  on both the domestic and the international market. In particular  the latter is benefiting from the impetus of the recent distribution agreements signed with reference to the German and Spanish market  the increase in sales by Worldconnect  and finally the inclusion of the revenues of the acquired companies (contributing with 3.8% of the above increase).

Performance in the Iberian Peninsula (Spain and Portugal)  up 19.0%  in Switzerland (+35.0%)  as well as in the Middle East region  up 19.1% over 2022  is also noteworthy. The numbers reflect the Group's internationalisation drive  also thanks to the trade agreements signed during the year. The share of sales in foreign markets accounts for 51.6% of the Group's total sales (47.7% in 2022). In Italy  where the Group's absolute leadership is confirmed  revenue growth is +6.9%  thanks to the consolidation of strategic partnerships with major players. Analysis of operating profit and consolidated profit for the year The 2023 cost analysis shows that: the Cost of sales came to EUR 97.5 million  compared with EUR 88.8 million in 2022  equating to 61.4% of revenues  as compared with 64.5% of last year.came to EUR 97.5 million  compared with EUR 88.8 million in 2022  equating to 61.4% of revenues  as compared with 64.5% of last year. Sales and distribution costs   General and administrative costs and Other non-operating costs/income totalled EUR 56.3 million in 2023 (EUR 125.1 million at 31 December 2022). The delta is mainly due to the impairment of Goodwill recognised in 2022 in the amount of EUR 75.4 million booked into General and Administrative Costs; net of the write-down of goodwill  the item amounted to EUR 49.7 million: the incidence on Revenues improves from 36.1% in 2022 to 35.5% in 2023. FY 2023 EBIT came to EUR 4.9 million (EUR -76.3 million in FY 2022); Adjusted EBIT - calculated net of EUR 6.7 million for amortisation of Purchase Price Allocation  EUR 2.1 million for non-recurring costs and increased by EUR 0.3 million for operating foreign exchange differences was EUR 14.0 million  up 36.7% on the previous year (EUR 10.3 million). 3Adjusted EBITDA  an indicator considered by the Company to be representative of the Group's operating profitability trend  amounted to EUR 20.8 million in 2023  up from the previous year (EUR 16.6 million)  thanks to business development and margin improvements as well as the cost control policies discussed above. This indicator is obtained by adding operating depreciation and amortisation to the Adjusted EBIT  of EUR 6.7 million. The Adjusted EBITDA Margin was 13.1% in 2023 (12.1% in the previous year)  also improving (+100bps) compared to 2022. Net financial expenses amounted to EUR 1.5 million  compared to EUR 0.7 million in 2022. The difference is mainly attributable to the increase in interest rates on outstanding loans as a result of the ECB's anti-inflation actions. As a result of the above  the Net Profit for the financial year amounted to EUR 3.6 million  compared to EUR -75.2 million in FY 2022. Net of adjustments relating to extraordinary and non-recurring items  Adjusted Net Profit was EUR 7.7 million (EUR 5.7 million in 2022). Analysis of consolidated net financial position and operating cash flow Net financial debt as of 31 December 2023 amounted to EUR 35.4 million (EUR 40.4 million as of 31 December 2022) and included payables to the banks  net of cash on hand (EUR 23.5 million)  payables related to the valuation of put/call options for the purchase of minorities (EUR 7.8 million) and lease payables in application of IFRS 16 (EUR 4.1 million). The reduction in net financial debt as at 31 December 2023 compared to the same date in the previous year  amounting to EUR 5 million  is mainly attributable to increased profitability. The leverage ratio at the end of 2023 was 1.7x  a marked improvement over the figure for 2022 (2.4x). The covenant of the existing loan is respected. Operating cash flow for 2023 was a positive EUR 18.2 million  compared to EUR 8.5 million in the previous year. The main factors for this increase are commented on above.

Believe assumes limited currency headwinds embedded in the market (c. -2% expected for FY’24). Believe will further invest in its development during the year  while pursuing efficiency gains. Based on those assumptions  Believe expects: Organic growth of c. +18%. Adjusted organic growth for embedded market FX of c. +20%. Further progress in Adjusted EBITDA margin: c. 6.5%.The Group’s reinforced appeal is generating a higher level of attractive commercial opportunities and therefore of advances. The Group anticipates that artists and labels advances will increase in FY’24 in line with revenue  further building its long-term revenue base. Overall  advances will continue impacting free cash flow generation and the Group therefore anticipates free cash flow to be slightly positive in FY’24.Believe notes that it is the object of ongoing discussions around a potential change of control of the Group. At this stage  the Company is not in a position to assess the potential impact on its business and financial condition linked to the uncertainties created by the current situation.Denis Ladegaillerie  Founder and CEO said: “Believe is posting today healthy results  fully in line with expectations. These results are the outcome of tremendous teamwork of our teams in furtherance of our mission to develop artists and labels at all stages of their careers with expertise  respect  fairness  and transparency. In 2023  we have continued to hire great people  invest in technology and innovate with our partners with one objective: nurture early-stage talent  elevate established acts and support top-tier artists in reaching new creative and commercial heights. Invest and innovate to create ever more value for our artists and labels at all stages will remain the core of our strategy in 2024 and in the years to come!”.”FY 2023 KEY FIGURESin € million FY 2022 FY 2023 ChangeYoY Organic change Group Revenues 760.8 880.3 15.7% 14.4% Premium Solutions 712.6 825.1 15.8% 14.7% Automated Solutions 48.2 55.2 14.6% 9.9% Adjusted EBITDA pre-Central Platform 107.9 128.4 in % of revenues 14.2% 14.6% 40bps Premium Solutions 101.3 118.3 +16.8% Automated Solutions 6.6 10.1 +53.0% Central Platform (73.2) (78.1) +6.8% Group's Adjusted EBITDA 34.7 50.3 +44.8% in % of revenues 4.6% 5.7% 110bps Operating income / loss (EBIT) (22.3) (18.1) - Net income attributable to owners of the parent (29.8) (5.5) - Net cash from operating activities 73.7 12.7 Free cash flow 52.0 (3.1) Net cash and cash equivalents 303.3 214.2FY 2023 HIGHLIGHTSStrong performance of the roster and signing activity reflecting top quality of serviceBelieve further demonstrated its commitment to develop audiences for artists at all stages of their career and achieved a strong performance of its existing roster of artists and labels in FY’23. The Group gained additional market share in most key markets and positioned among top 3 players for local acts in many European and Asian markets. This solid performance resulted in an Adjusted organic growth of +19.5% in FY’23.Believe’s strength is its presence across 50 countries around the world with local teams on the ground who are fully part of the local music scenes and thus able to identify local artists and labels with the best potential to partner with and to accompany them at best in their development. The goal is to provide artists  regardless of their level of development  with the highest level of digital service quality in the market thanks to a unique tech-enabled approach and by leveraging globally the solutions developed centrally. The Group therefore resumed its investment in local and central teams in H2’23 after lowering their level in H1’23 to adapt to a more challenging economic environment. Believe’s focus on the quality of service resulted in strong commercial dynamism throughout FY’23  both in terms of renewals and new signings. Believe’s appeal to artists and labels increased in a wider variety of music genres thanks to their ongoing digitalization  which also supports the Group’s commercial success.Proven capacity of Premium Solutions in artist development from emerging to top charting talents in European countriesIn France  Believe proved its capacity to develop artists at the top of the market in several genres  as well as to nurture emerging talents  with 5 debut albums in the Top200. Believe ranked #1 on local acts in FY’23  with a 29% market share for the Top200 thanks to a strong presence both in new albums and tracks  and in catalog. The Group had 42 albums in the Top200 (physical + digital according to SNEP data). Several artists of the roster confirmed their high level of success during the year  further building Believe’s strength in French local repertoire  including WeRenoi  JUL  Yamê  Nej or Djadja & Dinaz.In Germany  Believe ranked 48 singles in the Top100 and achieved three times number one ranking during the year. The launch of B-electronic (electro / dance) and Madizin (schlager / pop)  respectively late 2022 and early 2023  allowed the Group to further diversify its roster in the country. Believe also renewed several local rap acts  including Raf Camora  the most streamed artist of FY’23 in Germany.In the UK  where the Group holds an emerging position  Believe witnessed a surge in the consumption of its roster with more than 35 billion streams during the year. The Believe UK team also won the Best Label/Artist Services at the Music Week Awards 2023 in H1’23  a true testament to the quality of service in digital.In Spain  the success of Iñigo Quintero’s viral hit ‘Si No Estás’  which is the first global #1 track for Believe  illustrated the growing digitalization of artist development and the strength of the Group’s expertise in this field. The key to success there has been a great partnership with the artist  his label and Believe’s key DSP partners  combined with Believe’s unique ability to combine strong AI data-driven expertise to maximize the momentum for an artist’s track at the right time with the right tools  supported by both local and global teams.The Group was also very active in Eastern Europe with a solid pipeline of new signings in FY’23. Believe has notably partnered with Azariah  the current top artist in Hungary and supported him in reaching new heights from being an Indie YouTube artist to becoming the biggest pop singer & songwriter in the country. The Group also developed its rap imprint in Romania and in Poland enabling artists like Rava  Guzior or Kaz Balagane to become top charting artists in Q4’23.Further building up leadership in Asia where the Group celebrated its first decade in 2023Believe’s Group has played a central role in the structuring of Asia Pacific’s music market. With over 10 000 labels & artists3 signed across in Asia Pacific excluding Japan in the past decade  Believe has paid more than €700 million in royalties back to the local music industry4  further fueling the growth of a sustainable local music ecosystem by fostering new artist development  funding the launch of new labels and exploring new genres of music and addressing new audiences. Such impact was strengthened by Believe’s continuous effort to invest in and nurture a new generation of music executives and digital experts  being one of the first companies to sign deals with local digital music services and supporting its international digital music partners as they rolled out their services in the region. In the last four years alone  Believe APAC has grown around twice the market growth  thus contributing to substantially strengthening an increasing local content market share.5Believe continued its expansion in Asia in H2’23. First  by building additional capabilities in Greater China  where the Group received 5 awards for Chinese rapper Capper from NetEase Cloud Music at the NetEase Annual Music Awards. Believe also launched its full offering in Japan where it only operated TuneCore so far  as the market undergoes an increased digitalization of local music genres. Believe also launched early 2024 PlayCode a new imprint dedicated to the Japanese hip-hop scene and signed 3 artists: ¥ellow Bucks  Red Eye and Issei Uno Fifth.The Group also further expanded its leadership in India in December 2023 with a new investment in the country’s largest digital music market segment  aka original soundtracks. Believe acquired White Hill Music’s premium Punjabi music catalog  a partner since 2017  including songs from active top and established artists from Northern India  such as Maninder Buttar  Gurnam Bhullar  Ninja  Nimrat Khaira  R Nait  Shivjot  Akhil  Happy Raikoti  who all have millions of listenership on YouTube and Spotify. Believe also acquired the existing YouTube channel  which has a strong 23.4 million subscriber base and will be used to promote the back-catalog and the new artists signed with Believe Artist Services.Launching new marketing program to position TuneCore (Automated Solutions segment) as a development engine for self-releasing artistsTuneCore Accelerator is a powerhouse marketing program designed to drive discovery of music  expand audiences  and promote deeper fan engagement. The program leverages industry-leading services powered by Believe’s technology  TuneCore’s marketing program  and innovative products. By integrating the program  artists gain access to an arsenal of industry-leading services and technologies and get greater support to reach their next development phase.In Q4’23  the first quarter following TuneCore Accelerator’s launch  nearly 10 000 artists increased their streams by an average of 143% compared to the previous quarter and most of them were able to enter a higher market segment. This represents about 1 in 8 artists who have been enrolled in the program since its launch. Building on these early positive results  TuneCore Accelerator will be expanded to enable even more self-releasing artists to grow.Confirming Believe’s commitment to foster healthy and fair music ecosystem to further Shape Music for GoodBelieve completed its third global employee satisfaction survey Your Voice. The participation rate was up to 81%  2 points higher than the previous survey and the global eNPS (employee Net Promoter Score) increased by 7 points compared to last year. Talent is key and at the heart of the Group’s model and strategy  which led Believe to roll out several actions to increase employee satisfaction over the course of the year.In the meantime  the Group pursued its focus on gender diversity and developing talent internally and witnessed a progression in all criteria retained in the CEO variable compensation:Gender diversity: 45.6% of women among employees.Training rate: 94.4% (in average  11 hours of training per employee).eNPS: 15 (steep increases versus last year’s level).Believe pursued its pivotal role in fighting against streaming fraud by taking a leadership role as a founding member of the Music Fights Fraud  by welcoming Spotify new model and decision to penalize fraud more strictly than in the past  by investing in new detection technologies and by reinforcing the education provided to artists and labels on the matter.The Group also pursued its efforts to support greater diversity in the music industry and just released the results of its fourth annual study BE THE CHANGE: Gender Equity in Music. Part of Shaping Music for Good program  BE THE CHANGE has become a key milestone to assess the challenges faced by female and gender expansive creators and music professionals globally.FY 2023 FINANCIALSAdjusted organic growth of +19.5% reflecting the anticipated recovery in growth rates witnessed in Q4’23FY’23 revenues grew by +15.7% to reach €880.3 million  reflecting an organic growth of +14.4%. Digital sales increased by +13.0% in FY’23  reflecting solid underlying trends and negative currency headwinds affecting royalties collected and reversed by DSPs. Adjusted from this negative embedded market FX effect  revenues grew by +19.5%. The change in perimeter related mainly to the integration of Sentric contributed for +2.6% to revenue growth but was partially offset by a negative forex impact mostly driven by the Turkish lira and the US dollar (-1.4%). Sentric contribution has been accounted for in non-digital sales  which therefore grew by almost +50% in FY’23.After reaching a low point in Q3’23  digital monetization started recovering in Q4’23 thanks to a combined impact of reduced market currency headwinds and improved comparison base in ad-funded streaming. Consequently  Believe recorded revenue growth of +18.1% in Q4’23  reflecting an adjusted organic growth of +21.8%.Premium Solutions driving organic growth  revenue growth of Automated Solutions enhanced by SentricDigital Music Sales6 (DMS) exceeded €1.2 billion in FY’23  reflecting double digit growth in Premium Solutions. DMS in Automated Solutions were affected by the strengthening of the euro versus the dollar.Premium Solutions revenues amounted to €825.1 million  an increase of +15.8%  mainly organically driven (organic growth of +14.7%). Adjusted from the negative embedded market FX in digital monetization  organic growth was above +20%. As anticipated  Q4’23 witnessed a solid improvement in digital versus the previous quarter. Paid streaming benefitted from price increases by several large DSPs and market share gains remained solid  while ad-funded streaming improved and currency headwinds affecting digital sales were reduced. Believe further demonstrated its capacity to enable labels to outperform their own market and supported artist development in a wider variety of music genres. Non-digital sales were particularly strong in the last quarter  reflecting the integration of Sentric  strong live activities in France and branding operations in Turkey.Automated Solutions revenues amounted to €55.2 million up by +14.6% in FY’23  reflecting organic growth of +9.9%  a negative forex impact related to the dollar of -2.9% and a perimeter effect related to the integration of Sentric self-served activities of +7.6%. The negative forex impact intensified in Q4’23  affecting digital monetization. The new marketing program TuneCore Accelerator was successfully launched at the end of the year  started contributing to Digital Music Sales in Q4’23 and will contribute to TuneCore’s revenue this year. TuneCore also increased the pricing of its paid subscription plans in December 2023  which will contribute to revenue growth in FY’24. Sentric is accounted for in non-digital sales  which therefore grew significantly since its acquisition. Non-digital sales were also significantly enhanced by a catch-up in TuneCore’s own publishing business in Q4’23. TuneCore was already offering a set of publishing services before Sentric’s acquisition.Strong growth in most geographiesin € million FY 2022 FY 2023 Change YoY Europe (excl.

Revenue growth was uplifted by the integration of Sentric  which was primarily present in the UK. Believe remained on a strong growth trajectory in Southern Europe and Eastern Europe. Digital monetization was affected by currency headwinds notably in the UK but was globally well oriented during the year in the whole region. The level of activity remained particularly sustained in Turkey  including its branding activities.Americas grew by +17.4% and represented 14.6% of Group revenues. The level of activity in Brazil and Mexico was strong throughout the year  showcasing the Group’s success in the Latin American music. In the US  which is led by TuneCore business  the Group recorded strong growth after a slight improvement in the first nine months of the year. Revenues were already affected by the weakening of the dollar versus the euro.In FY’23  revenue growth reached +14.9% in Asia Pacific and Africa  which represented 26.0% of Group revenues. The performance was affected over the course of the year by currency headwinds embedded in digital market monetization and by depressed ad-funded streaming. The Group pursued its strategy to build up a leader in Asia and its previous investment enabled additional market share gains across the region. The level of activity was particularly strong in Greater China and Japan. India and Southeast Asia grew at a slower pace  as revenues in those markets are more exposed to ad-funded streaming.In France  revenues increased by +14.9% in FY’23 and represented 16.8% of Group revenues. After growing by c. 8% in the first nine months  Believe recorded very strong growth in Q4’23 thanks to a strong calendar of new releases and higher live music activities. Believe is now well-established among the top 3 players for local acts and its performance became more influenced by the release calendar of top acts. Believe also confirmed its leadership in rap music and continued diversifying its roster during the year.In Germany  revenues were down -2.4% in FY’23 and represented 12.6% of Group revenues. Digital sales returned to healthy growth in Q4’23 after a solid H1’23 performance and temporary slowdown in Q3’23. The growth is driven by the strong positioning on local acts and was also supported by the ongoing diversification of music genres in the roster. Non-digital sales further declined as the Group accelerated its exit from contracts that were too heavy in physical sales and merchandising.Delivering profitable growth as demonstrated by the solid increase in Adjusted EBITDA marginBelieve also focused on improving efficiency during the year  carefully managing its investment cycles.Adjusted EBITDA pre-Central Platform costs7 grew by +19.0% in FY’23 to reach €128.4 million (versus €107.9 million in FY’22). In Premium Solutions  the Group resumed investment in local teams in H2’23 at a higher pace than in H1’23 as revenue ramp up was clearer and added sales and marketing capabilities in Europe and Asia. The Group also expanded operations in Greater China and opened new offices in Japan. In Automated Solutions  the Group introduced new features and developed a new marketing program to support the development of self-released artists. As a result  sales & marketing at the segment level increased year-over-year with an acceleration in H2’23. Adjusted EBITDA margin pre-Central Platform reached 14.6%  an increase of 40bps compared with FY’22. This margin included growth investments in both segments  which represented 3.0% of total revenues excluding Sentric in FY’23 (vs 4.9% in FY’22).Central Platform costs (€78.1 million in FY’23 versus €73.2 million in FY’22) increased by +6.8% year-over-year  and further decreased over revenue  representing 8.9% in FY’23 compared with 9.6% in FY’22. Efficiency plans enabled the Group to optimize its investments in the Central Platform over the course of the year. The Group pursued its investment in data analysis  digital marketing and AI-backed tools for discovery and audience development  but also postponed secondary projects. Better amortization of the Central Platform provided significant operating leverage in FY’23 as in previous years.As usual some Central Platform investments are capitalized under IFRS accounting principles. In FY’23  total investment (P&L and capitalized costs) in the Central Platform amounted to €91.6 million. Total investment went up +3.1% year-over-year and represented 10.4% of total Group revenues compared with 11.7% in FY’22.The Group’s Adjusted EBITDA increased by c. +45% year-over-year to reach €50.3 million in FY’23 compared with €34.7 million in FY’22. Adjusted EBITDA margin amounted to 5.7% compared with 4.6% in FY’22. This increase of 110bps resulted from the improved profitability of the segment and better amortization of Central Platform costs. Believe was steadily during the year at its mid-term objective level (Group adjusted EBITDA margin of 5% to 7% by 2025).Operating income (EBIT) - Depreciation & Amortization amounted to €61.3 million in FY’23  a steep increase compared with last year (+36.7%)  as acquisitions resumed in H1’23 with that of Sentric in March. The Group also made some investment in catalog  including notably the acquisition of White Hill Music in December. The Adjusted EBITDA improvement partially offset the increase in Depreciation & Amortization  enabling a loss reduction at the EBIT level compared with last year.Free cash flow reflecting commercial dynamism and solid cash level at the end of December’23Working capital variation remained negative by €23.7 million for the full year but witnessed some improvement in H2’23 as anticipated. Believe had additional attractive commercial opportunities to renew and sign artists and labels and provided additional financing through advances in H2’23. There has been less request to sign on much longer terms than usual as this was the case in Q2’23. The increase in advances was therefore limited in the second half and amounted to €81.2 million in FY’23. The current activity enabled the Group to extract cash from the working capital in FY’23  further compensating for the elevated level of artists and label advances.Capitalized development costs were in line with previous years and amounted to €17.9 million on a full year basis (2% of Group revenues).Free cash flow was negative by just €3.1 million in FY’23  mostly due to negative working capital variation.Cash on the balance sheet amounted to €214.2 million at the end of December’23 compared to €303.3 million at the end of December’22  mostly reflecting the acquisition of Sentric  catalog acquisitions including White Hill Music’s catalog and higher artist and label advances.FY’24 OUTLOOK AND MID-TERM OBJECTIVESIn FY’24  the Group will continue to drive a profitable growth trajectory towards its long-term profitability objective of 15% Adjusted EBITDA margin.The revenue growth scenario implies solid paid streaming trends  which will combine new subscribers and price increases at some DSPs and a progressive recovery of ad-funded streaming. Ad-funded streaming is not anticipated to recover in emerging markets before the second half of the year. The growth scenario also implies additional market share gains across regions  and notably in countries where the Group is not yet ranking in the Top 3 for local acts. Believe also anticipates an improved currency environment for digital monetization. The Group assumes that the negative embedded market FX effect will amount to -2%  compared with -5.1% in FY’23. Consequently  Believe expects Adjusted Organic growth of c. +20% in FY’24. Organic growth is expected in Q1’24 to be below Q4’23 rate  which benefited from a very strong level of live and branding activities and should accelerate from Q2’24.The Group will continue to adapt the investment cycle to market growth and will therefore size its investment in each key market. Believe will also continue to optimize investments in the Central Platform and increase efficiency through automatization. The Group will further focus on efficiency during the year  but margin improvement will be lower than in FY’23 due to the higher level of Tech & Product spending. As a result  the Group anticipates an Adjusted EBITDA margin of c. 6.5%.Believe notes that it is the object of ongoing discussions around a potential change of control of the Group. At this stage  the Company is not in a position to assess the potential impact on its business and financial condition of the uncertainty created by the current situation.The Group will continue to allocate cash between advances and acquisitions in the next months.

For the 2023 PCAOB Audit in particular  the Company is required to identify an auditor who meets the principal auditor requirements under the PCAOB auditing standards and is a PCAOB-registered auditor in order to either perform (or assume responsibility for) the audit work in the countries where it had major assets or revenue in 2023  or alternatively divide responsibility with other auditors who are PCAOB-registered. A suitable auditor that is qualified to provide these services in the countries where VEON operates has not yet been identified.ADVERTISEMENTAs a result of the anticipated delays in its filings  the Company expects that it will not be in compliance with its listing requirements once the applicable deadlines have passed  and will focus on regaining compliance as soon as practicable.VEON also expects to be delayed in delivering the audited consolidated financial statements of its subsidiary  VEON Holdings BV  to the holders of the outstanding notes of VEON Holdings BV (the “VEON Holdings Notes”) and its revolving credit facility (the “RCF”) creditors  as well as in the delivery of the Company’s 2023 audited financials to the RCF creditors.

The Acquisition was implemented by way of a court-sanctioned scheme of arrangement (“Scheme”) between Forward and Scheme Shareholders under Part 26 of the Companies Act.Further to the announcement made by Forward and Molten today that the Scheme had become Effective in accordance with its terms following delivery of the Court Order to the Registrar of Companies  applications have been made to the Financial Conduct Authority and London Stock Exchange for the 14 785 049 new ordinary shares of £0.01 each (""New Molten Shares"") issued in relation to the Scheme to be admitted to the premium listing segment of the Official List and to trading on the London Stock Exchange’s main market for listed securities. An application has also been made to Euronext Dublin in respect of a secondary listing on the Euronext Dublin Daily Official List and to trading on the Euronext Dublin Market. Admission and commencement of dealings in the New Molten Shares is expected to take place at or soon after 8.00 a.m. on 15 March 2024  at which time the Acquisition will complete.Martin Davis  Chief Executive Officer  Molten Ventures  commented:“The acquisition of Forward Partners will enable us to diversify the blend of maturity of our assets and provide a broader pipeline for follow-on investment. It follows soon after our acquisition of a stake in Seedcamp III  which also diversified asset maturity but with the addition of exposure to high-quality assets with nearer term visibility on realisation opportunities. This ongoing expansion of the platform helps position the business to capture opportunities at attractive valuations in what is increasingly a buyers’ market for venture capital.”Following Admission  Molten’s issued share capital will consist of 189 046 450 ordinary shares of £0.01 with each share carrying the right to one vote. Molten holds no shares in treasury. The total number of voting rights in Molten will therefore be 189 046 450.
