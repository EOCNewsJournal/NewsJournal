37496,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rt.com/business/594259-eu-russia-frozen-assetes-ukraine/,EU members oppose plan to arm Kiev with Russian money – Politico,An EU plan to use the profits from Russia’s frozen assets to buy arms for Kiev has faced resistance from some bloc members  Politico says  Read Full Article at RT.com,Malta  Luxembourg  and Hungary have reportedly warned against directing the proceeds generated by the frozen assets to Ukraine’s militaryA European Union plan to use the profits generated by Russia’s central bank assets frozen in the bloc to buy weapons for Ukraine has faced resistance from Malta  Luxembourg  and Hungary  Politico reported on Thursday  citing an EU official.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen last month suggested using the interest earned from the assets to acquire weapons for Ukraine rather than using the funds for reconstruction  as had been initially planned.According to the outlet  Malta  Luxembourg and Hungary “expressed reservations” about the plan during a meeting of the EU’s 27 ambassadors on Wednesday. The report indicated that von der Leyen’s idea of using Russian money to purchase arms for Kiev has “complicated talks” ahead of the EU leaders’ summit in Brussels next week.The West has frozen roughly $300 billion in holdings belonging to the Russian central bank since the start of the Ukraine conflict two years ago. Brussels-based clearinghouse Euroclear holds around €191 billion ($205 billion) of the funds and has accrued nearly €4.4 billion in interest over the past year.The EU is aiming to give Kiev between €2 and €3 billion in revenue generated by the frozen assets this year  the Financial Times reported earlier this week. A first tranche of the money could be disbursed as early as July if Brussels can secure the approval of all bloc members  the outlet said  citing EU officials.Some member states are cautious about the controversial proposal  saying it needs a more thorough analysis  Bloomberg said in a separate report on Tuesday.Hungary has reportedly insisted that the proceeds from the Russian assets should be allocated to Ukraine’s reconstruction rather than be used for funding its military  the outlet said  citing people familiar with the discussions.While Kiev’s Western backers generally agree that the frozen assets should be used to aid Ukraine  they are at odds about whether an outright seizure would be legal. While the US and UK support the direct expropriation of the funds  some EU member states  France and Germany in particular  warn the move would erode trust in the European financial system.It’s also argued that such a drastic move would set a bad precedent that could push other countries to avoid holding their reserves in Western currencies out of fear that they could someday also becomes targets of sanctions.Moscow has warned that it would respond in kind if the West went through with its threats to confiscate the assets. Russia has repeatedly said that any actions taken against its assets would amount to “theft ” stressing that seizing the funds or any similar move would violate international law and undermine Western currencies  the global financial system  and the world economy.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section,negative,0.06,0.37,0.57,negative,0.02,0.27,0.71,True,English,"['EU members', 'Russian money', 'plan', 'Kiev', 'Politico', 'President Ursula von der Leyen', 'Brussels-based clearinghouse Euroclear', 'global financial system', 'Russian central bank', 'European financial system', 'EU leaders’ summit', 'European Union plan', 'central bank assets', 'EU member states', 'European Commission', 'Financial Times', 'EU official', 'past year', 'first tranche', 'controversial proposal', 'thorough analysis', 'Western backers', 'outright seizure', 'direct expropriation', 'bad precedent', 'other countries', 'Western currencies', 'international law', 'business section', 'Russian money', 'Russian assets', 'drastic move', 'similar move', 'The West', 'bloc members', 'separate report', 'frozen assets', 'world economy', 'Ukraine conflict', 'Malta', 'Luxembourg', 'Hungary', 'proceeds', 'military', 'profits', 'weapons', 'resistance', 'Politico', 'Thursday', 'interest', 'funds', 'reconstruction', 'outlet', 'reservations', 'meeting', '27 ambassadors', 'Wednesday', 'idea', 'arms', 'Kiev', 'talks', 'holdings', 'start', 'revenue', 'July', 'approval', 'Bloomberg', 'Tuesday', 'people', 'discussions', 'odds', 'France', 'Germany', 'trust', 'reserves', 'fear', 'targets', 'sanctions', 'Moscow', 'kind', 'threats', 'actions', 'stories', 'finance']",2024-03-14,2024-03-15,rt.com

The names of the chair of the board  together with the three appointed members and the names of the parties they have been appointed by shall be made public as soon as the nomination committee has been appointed  which should be no later than six months prior to the annual general meeting. If  at this time  fewer than three owners have expressed a desire to participate in the nomination committee  the nomination committee shall consist of fewer than four members.

Item 13 - Resolution on approval of remuneration report The board of directors proposes that the meeting resolves to approve the board of directors' report on remuneration pursuant to Chapter 8  Section 53 a of the Swedish Companies Act. Item 14 - Resolution on guidelines for remuneration to executive management The board of directors proposes that the general meeting resolves on the following guidelines for remuneration to executive management. Board members  the chief executive officer (the ""CEO"")  the chief financial officer (the ""CFO"") and members of the group management fall within the provisions of these guidelines. The guidelines are applicable to remuneration agreed  and amendments to remuneration already agreed  after adoption of the guidelines by the annual general meeting 2024. These guidelines do not apply to any remuneration resolved upon by the general meeting  such as fees for the board of directors and share-related incentive programs. The guidelines' promotion of the company's business strategy  long-term interests and sustainability The company's business idea is to acquire  develop and manage high-quality properties in the Nordics with daily good store chains as anchor tenants. The company currently owns approximately 450 properties in Finland  Sweden  Norway and Denmark. For more information regarding the company's business strategy  please refer to Cibus' latest annual report. A prerequisite for the successful implementation of the company's business strategy and safeguarding of its long-term interests  including its sustainability  is that the company is able to recruit and retain qualified personnel. To this end  it is necessary that the company offers competitive remuneration. These guidelines enable the company to offer the executive management a competitive total remuneration. A long-term warrant plan has been implemented for the CEO. The plan has been resolved upon by the general meeting and is therefore excluded from these guidelines. The long-term warrant plan proposed by the board of directors to the annual general meeting 2024 for approval is excluded for the same reason. The proposed plan essentially corresponds to the existing plan. The performance criteria used to assess the outcome of the plans are distinctly linked to the business strategy and thereby to the company's long-term value creation  including its sustainability. The plans are further conditional upon the participant's own investment and certain holding periods of several years. For more information regarding these plans  including the criteria which the outcome depends on  please see the company's website  www.cibusnordic.com. Variable cash remuneration covered by these guidelines shall aim at promoting the company's business strategy and long-term interests  including its sustainability. Types of remuneration  etc. The remuneration shall be on market terms and competitive  and may consist of the following components: fixed cash salary  variable cash remuneration  pension benefits and other benefits. Additionally  the general meeting may resolve on  among other things  share-related or share price-related remuneration. The satisfaction of criteria for awarding variable cash remuneration shall be measured over a period of one or several years. The variable cash remuneration may amount to not more than 50 per cent of the total fixed cash salary under the measurement period. Pension benefits  including health insurance  shall be premium defined unless the individual concerned is subject to defined benefit pension under mandatory collective agreement provisions. The pension premiums for premium defined pension may amount to not more than 30 per cent of the income which is the basis for the pension. For employments governed by rules other than Swedish  pension benefits and other benefits may be duly adjusted for compliance with mandatory rules or established local practice  considering  to the extent possible  the overall purpose of these guidelines. Terminationof employment The notice period may not exceed twelve months if notice of termination of employment is made by the company. Fixed cash salary during the period of notice and severance pay may together not exceed an amount equivalent to the fixed cash salary for two years. The period of notice may not to exceed six months without any right to severance pay when termination is made by the executive. Additionally  remuneration may be paid for non-compete undertakings. Such remuneration shall compensate for loss of income and shall only be paid in so far as the previously employed executive is not entitled to severance pay. The remuneration shall be based on the fixed cash salary at the time of termination of employment and be paid during the time the non-compete undertaking applies  however not for more than six months following termination of employment. Criteria for awarding variable cash remuneration  etc. The variable cash remuneration shall be linked to predetermined and measurable criteria which can be financial or non-financial. They may also be individualized  quantitative or qualitative objectives. The criteria shall be designed so as to contribute to the company's business strategy and long-term interests  including its sustainability  by for example being clearly linked to the business strategy or promote the executive's long-term development. To which extent the criteria for awarding variable cash remuneration has been satisfied shall be assessed and determined when the measurement period has ended. The board of directors is responsible for the evaluation so far as it concerns variable cash remuneration to the CEO. For variable cash remuneration to other executives  the CEO is responsible for the evaluation. For financial objectives  the evaluation shall be based on the latest financial information made public by the company. Salary and employment conditions for employees In the preparation of the board of directors' proposal for these remuneration guidelines  salary and employment conditions for employees of the company have been considered by including information on the employees' total income  the components of the remuneration and increase and growth rate over time  in the board of directors' basis of decision when evaluating whether the guidelines and the limitations set out herein are reasonable. The decision-making process to determine  review and implement the guidelines The board of directors shall prepare a proposal for new guidelines when there is need for significant changes and at least every fourth year and submit it to the general meeting. The guidelines shall be in force until new guidelines are adopted by the general meeting. The board of directors shall also monitor and evaluate programs for variable remuneration for the executive management  the application of the guidelines for executive remuneration as well as the current remuneration structures and compensation levels in the company. The CEO and other members of the executive management do not participate in the board of directors' processing of and resolutions regarding remuneration-related matters in so far as they are affected by such matters. Derogation from the guidelines The board of directors may temporarily resolve to derogate from the guidelines  in whole or in part  if in a specific case there is special cause for the derogation and a derogation is necessary to serve the company's long-term interests  including its sustainability  or to ensure the company's financial viability. Item 15 - Resolution on authorization for the board of directors to resolve upon new issue The board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to authorize the board of directors  on one or several occasions  during the period until the next annual general meeting  to decide on new issues of shares  warrants and/or convertible bonds  with or without deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights. Furthermore  the proposal provides that the issue may be made against payment in cash  by set-off or in kind  or subject to other conditions. The total number of shares that may be issued  or accrue through the exercise of warrants or the conversion convertible bonds  under the authorization may not exceed ten percent of the total number of outstanding shares in the company at the time of the annual general meeting. The purpose of the authorization  and the reason for any deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  is to be able to continuously adjust the company's capital structure and thereby contribute to increased shareholder value and to enable the company to finance  wholly or partly  any future acquisitions by issuing shares  warrants and/or convertible bonds as payment in connection with agreements on acquisitions or to raise capital for such acquisitions. The board of directors  or a party designated by the board  has the right to decide on minor changes to the general meeting's resolution that may be necessary in connection with registration of the resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office or due to other formal requirements. Item 16 - Resolution on authorization for the board of directors to resolve upon acquisition and transfer of own shares The board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves upon that the board of directors shall be authorized to  on one or several occasions for the period until the next annual general meeting  acquire own shares in the company so that  as a maximum  the company's holding following the acquisition does not exceed ten percent of all the shares in the company at any time. Acquisitions may only be conducted at Nasdaq Stockholm and at a price that is within the registered range for the share price prevailing at any time  that is  the range between the highest bid price and the lowest ask price. However  for acquisitions carried out by a stock broker on behalf of the company  the price for the shares may correspond to the volume weighted average price during the time period within which the shares were acquired  even if the volume weighted average price on the day of delivery to Cibus falls outside the price range. Payment for the shares shall be made in cash. The board of directors further proposes that the general meeting resolves to authorize the board of directors to  on one or several occasions for the period until the next annual general meeting  resolve upon transfer of own shares. The number of shares to be transferred may not exceed the total number of shares held by the company at any time. Transfers may be conducted on or outside Nasdaq Stockholm  including a right to resolve upon deviations from the shareholders' preferential rights. Transfer of shares on Nasdaq Stockholm shall take place at a price within the price range applicable at any given time. Transfers of shares outside Nasdaq Stockholm shall be conducted at a price in cash or value in property that corresponds to  at the time of the transfer  the current market share price of the shares in the company that are transferred  with such deviation that the board of directors considers appropriate depending on the circumstances of each case. The purpose of the authorizations is to provide the board of directors with greater opportunities to adapt the company's capital structure and thereby contribute to increased shareholder value and to enable the company to  wholly or partly  finance any future acquisitions in a cost-effective manner through payment with the company's own shares. Item 17 - Resolution on warrant plan  issue of warrants and transfer of warrants The board of directors of the company proposes that the general meeting resolves upon introducing a warrant plan (the ""Warrant Plan"") for employees in the company. The objective of the Warrant Plan  and the reason for deviating from the shareholders' preferential rights  is to strengthen the link between the employees and created shareholder value. By that means  it is considered that there will be an increased alignment of interests between the employees and the shareholders of the company. 1. Issue of warrants and participants 1.1 The company shall issue up to 470 000 warrants under the Warrant Plan. The right to subscribe for the warrants shall  with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  be granted to a wholly owned subsidiary of the company (the ""Subsidiary"")  with the right and obligation as set forth in section 2 below to transfer the warrants to employees in the company in accordance with the distribution presented in section 1.3 below. Over-subscription may not take place. The warrants shall be issued free of charge to the Subsidiary. 1.2 Subscription of the warrants shall take place within four weeks from the date of the resolution to issue warrants. The board of directors shall have right to extend the subscription period. 1.3 The right to acquire warrants shall be granted to the employees of the company in accordance with the following categories: Category Guaranteed number of warrants per person A. CEO 100 000 B. CFO and COO75 000 Total within the category: 150 000 C. Other members of the management team and Treasury Manager (approximately 4 persons) 40 000 Total within the category: 160 000 D. Other employees(approximately 6 persons) 10 000 Total within the category: 60 000 1.4 Should warrants remain after all applications have been satisfied up to the guaranteed level as set out in the table in section 1.3 above  the remaining warrants shall be available for allotment to participants regardless of category. Such additional allotment of warrants shall however amount to a maximum of 50 percent in relation to the guaranteed level which is set out in the table above. Should not the remaining number of warrants be sufficient to satisfy such additional allotment  the remaining warrants shall be allotted to these participants pro rata in relation to the number of warrants subscribed for. The board of directors of the company shall decide on the final allotment. 1.5 The right to acquire warrants from the Subsidiary shall only belong to employees in the company who have not terminated their employment  been dismissed or whose employment have otherwise ceased at the end of the application period. Warrants may also be offered to future new employees. For such acquisitions  the conditions shall be the same or equivalent to what is stated in this resolution. This means among other that acquisitions shall be made at market value at the time of the acquisition. 2. Transfer of warrants and subsidy 2.1 The Subsidiary shall transfer the warrants to the participants at market value. The market value of the warrants is approximately SEK 7.98 per warrant  according to a preliminary valuation. The preliminary valuation is based on a market value of the underlying share of SEK 126.40 which corresponds to the closing price of the company share on 8 March 2024  an assumed subscription price of SEK 139.00 per share and takes into account the value limitation set out in section 3.2 below. The Black & Scholes pricing model has been used for the valuation under the assumption of a risk-free interest rate of 2.37 percent  dividend in line with consensus estimates  and a volatility of 30 percent. 2.2 The company intends to subsidise the warrant premium for the warrants by the company repaying the amount paid by the participant as payment for the warrants by means of a cash bonus. The company will pay such social security contributions (Sw. sociala avgifter) as the company is legally obliged to pay as a result of payment of the cash bonus. Only premiums for warrants that do not exceed the guaranteed level of each participant will be subsidised  in accordance with what is stated in item 1.3 above. 3. Time and price for subscription for shares 3.1 Each warrant shall entitle to subscription of one (1) share in the company at a subscription price in SEK of 110 percent of the average volume-weighted price paid for the company's share on Nasdaq Stockholm during the period 24 April - 2 May 2024[1]. If the company has inside information during the aforementioned period  the board of directors shall be entitled to postpone the measurement period. The subscription price may not be lower than the current quota value of the share. 3.2 If the average price of the company's share  calculated as set out in the complete terms and conditions for the warrants  during the subscription period of new shares by exercising the warrants  exceeds 180 percent (the ""Cap"") of the calculated volume-weighted average price paid för the company's share on Nasdaq Stockholm during the period 24 April - 2 May 2024  a recalculated lower number of shares to which each warrant entitles shall apply. 3.3 Subscription for shares in accordance with the terms and conditions for the warrants (see the separate terms and conditions available at the company's website) may take place during the following time periods: a period of two weeks from the day following the publication of the Company's interim report for the period 1 January - 31 March 2027  but not earlier than 13 April 2027 and no later than 5 June 2027  a period of two weeks from the day following the publication of the Company's interim report for the period 1 January - 30 June 2027  but not earlier than 16 August 2027 and no later than 6 September 2027  and a period of two weeks from the day following the publication of the Company's interim report for the period 1 January - 30 September 2027  but not earlier than 12 October 2027 and no later than 30 November 2027. 3.4 If the Cap is reached during any relevant measurement period (see below)  the company shall give notice thereof  whereby holders of warrants  in addition to what is stated in section 3.3 above regarding the time for notice of subscription  shall be entitled to subscribe for shares by exercising the subscription right within a two-week period after the date of such notice. ""Relevant measurement period"" means a period of five trading days after the date of publication of the company's interim reports (including year-end report) during the term of the Warrant Plan  however  subscription of shares in accordance with the above shall at the earliest be possible during a two-week period commencing on 20 July 2024. 3.5 However  subscription of shares may not take place during such period when trading with the shares in the company is prohibited pursuant to Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014 on market abuse (the Market Abuse Regulation)  or any corresponding legislation applicable at the relevant point in time. 3.6 The number of shares that the warrants entitle to  and the subscription price may be recalculated on the basis of  among other things  bonus issues  share splits or reverse share splits  rights issues or certain reductions of the share capital or similar actions (whereby also the value limitation in section 3.2 above may be adjusted accordingly). Recalculation of the subscription price may also take place if dividends paid during the term of the Warrant Plan deviate from the dividends projected used to determine the warrant premium when transferring the warrants. Complete terms and conditions for the warrants are set forth in the terms and conditions to the proposal which are available at the company's website. The new shares that may be issued if the warrants are exercised are not subject to any restrictions. 3.7 The shares that are newly issued following subscription shall entitle to dividends for the first time on the first record date for dividends which occurs after subscription for shares is effected as a result of exercising the warrants. 3.8 The board of directors of the company may by means of a board resolution and with the consent from the board of directors in the Subsidiary cancel the warrants held by the Subsidiary and which are not transferred in accordance with section 2. Cancellation shall be registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office. 4. Increase of share capital  dilution and costs etc. 4.1 Increase of share capital and dilution Upon full subscription and full exercise of the proposed warrants  470 000 new shares may be issued  corresponding to an increase in the company's share capital with EUR 4 700. Such increase corresponds to a dilution of the shareholders' holdings of approximately 0.82 percent of the total number of shares in the company if all warrants are exercised  subject to any recalculation according to the terms and conditions for the warrants. The portion of the subscription price for the warrants that exceeds the quota value of the shares shall be apportioned to the non-restricted share premium reserve. 4.2 Alternative exercise model The participants in the Warrant Plan shall have the right to  upon subscription for shares using the warrants  request that an alternative exercise model shall be applied in accordance with the complete terms and conditions. Upon application of the alternative exercise model  the subscription price for each share shall correspond to SEK 0.20 and the warrants shall entitle to a recalculated  generally lower  number of shares.[2] However  the warrants shall not entitle to more than one (1) share per warrant  subject to any recalculation in accordance with the complete terms and conditions for the warrants. Recalculation of the number of shares that each warrant entitles to subscription of shall be carried out by the company in accordance with the following formula: recalculated number of shares that each warrant entitles to subscription of = The share's volume weighted average price during a period of 5 trading days following the first day in the subscription period under which the warrants can be exercised for subscription (""Actual Share Price"") reduced by the subscription price Actual Share Price reduced by SEK 0.20 per share 4.3 Costs etc. The Warrant Plan is expected to have a marginal impact on the company's financial ratios. The company intends to subsidise the price for the warrants by the company repaying the amount paid by the participant as payment for the warrants by means of a cash bonus. The company will pay such social security contributions (Sw. sociala avgifter) as the company is legally obliged to pay as a result of payment of the cash bonus. The participants will in turn pay income tax on the bonus amount. The subsidy will entail that the company's result is charged with personnel costs and employer contributions  which are estimated to amount to approximately SEK 4.9 million. The company will receive an amount estimated to approximately SEK 3.8 million corresponding to the total warrant premiums  which is reported under equity  whereby the subsidy has limited impact liquidity wise. The Warrant Plan is otherwise expected to entail only certain limited costs for the company in the form of fees to external advisors and administration of the Warrant Plan. No measures for hedging the Warrant Plan are intended to be taken. 5. Right of first refusal and lock-up undertakings 5.1 The warrants shall further be subject to an obligation for the participants in the Warrant Plan and a corresponding right for the company to repurchase the warrants if the participant wishes to transfer or otherwise dispose of the warrants to a third party or if the participant's employment in the company is terminated during the term of the Warrant Plan. Such an offer to repurchase the warrants shall be made at the lower of (i) the market value for the warrants at the time when the company's right to repurchase arises  and (ii) a price that varies depending on when the company's right to repurchase arises  whereby the price shall be 25 percent of the initial warrant premium if the right to repurchase arises on the date of the participant's acquisition of the warrants and 100 percent of the initial warrant premium if the repurchase right arises on 31 March 2027. If the repurchase right arises at a time between the date of the participant's acquisition of the warrants and 31 March 2027  the price shall be increased on a linear basis from 25 percent up to 100 percent depending on the amount of time that has elapsed between the date of acquisition and 31 March 2027. 5.2 Participation in the Warrant Plan requires that the participant has entered into a so-called lock-up undertaking in favour of the company in respect of any shares that the participant may subscribe for in connection with early subscription of shares pursuant to section 3.4 above  meaning that the participant  with customary exceptions  has undertaken not to dispose of these shares until at the earliest in connection with the commencement of the first subscription period pursuant to section 3.3 above. 6. Preparation of the proposal etc. 6.1 The Warrant Plan has been prepared by the board of directors of the company and has been discussed at board meetings during the spring of 2024. None of the participants has had a significant influence on the final design of the Warrant Plan. 6.2 Apart from the proposed Warrant Plan  the company has four outstanding warrant plans which were introduced in 2020  2021  2022 and 2023 for the company's management team. The warrant plans introduced in 2020 and 2021 respectively  were not addressed to the CEO (for a more detailed description of outstanding warrant plans  see the company's renumeration report for the financial year 2023). Aside from this  there are currently no outstanding share based incentive plans in the company. 7.

37505,Euroclear,Bing API,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/14/eu-profit-frozen-russian-assets-ukraine,EU moves towards using €27bn in profit from frozen Russian assets for Ukraine,Officials could put forward proposal before meeting of prime ministers in Brussels next week,EU leaders are to take a significant step towards confiscating a potential €27bn in profit generated over the next four years by Russian state assets frozen in Europe to help fund the war effort in Ukraine.Officials at the European Commission are poised to put forward what they believe is a legally robust proposal to be considered by member states  possibly before a meeting of prime ministers in Brussels next Thursday.About $300bn belonging to the Russian central bank has been frozen in the west  largely in foreign currency  gold and government bonds. About 70% of these are held in the Belgian central securities depository Euroclear  which is holding the equivalent of €190bn.Deposits held in Europe are likely to generate between €15bn and €20bn in after-tax profits between now and the end of 2027  the end of the EU’s current financial cycle  depending on the evolution of global interest rates  a senior EU official said.This year they are expected to generate between €2bn and €3bn in profits  depending on potential interest rate changes – money that could then go straight to Ukraine.While officials are hopeful of an agreement on seizing the profits  they do not expect a deal yet on how the money should be used  because some states are against using it to fund Ukraine’s military  preferring that the cash be spent on reconstruction and humanitarian efforts.Ireland  for example  is bound by neutrality through long standing foreign policy  but it contributes funds to Ukraine on condition that the money is spent on “non-lethal” purposes such as clearing landmines.Sources say the European Commission will not offer options at this time in relation to the use of the money. “It means they can agree in principle to use the revenues of profits but then have a further discussion on where that money can go constitutionally for every member state ” one source said.“The process has gathered momentum and we expect the wheels will move very quickly on this once the decision is made.”Last month EU leaders agreed that the proceeds could be held in a separate account  clearing the war for “step B”  which would be a decision that this money could be confiscated and sent to Ukraine.The communique drafted by ambassadors for prime ministers’ approval next week is sufficiently vague. “The European Council reviewed progress on the next concrete steps towards directing extraordinary revenues stemming from Russia’s immobilised assets for the benefits of Ukraine including the funding of military support ” it states.It is expected that some of the money will be retained in the EU as part of a defence fund against expected Russian legal retaliation in the long term.Any agreement will put pressure on the British government to follow suit. The Russian central bank holds £26bn in the UK  and the foreign secretary  David Cameron  has joined the Ukrainian president  Volodymyr Zelenskiy  in calling for the money to be seized and handed to Kyiv.However  the idea is being resisted by financial institutions  who fear it could undermine trust in the City of London.skip past newsletter promotion Sign up to Business Today Free daily newsletter Get set for the working day – we'll point you to all the business news and analysis you need every morning Enter your email address Sign up Privacy Notice: Newsletters may contain info about charities  online ads  and content funded by outside parties.

TO ARTICLE 17 MAR MPC Capital increases shareholding in MPC Container Ships - Increase of strategic stake in leading platform for container ships- Purchase price of around USD 1.31 per MPCC share (EPS 2023: USD 0.73)- Positive impact on earnings expectations for financial year 2024 Hamburg  15 March 2024 - Hamburg-based asset and investment manager MPC Münchmeyer Petersen Capital AG (""MPC Capital""  Deutsche Börse Scale  ISIN DE000A1TNWJ4) has increased its shareholding in Oslo-listed MPC Container Ships ASA (""MPCC""  Oslo Stock Exchange  ISIN NO0010791353) from around 7% to around 14%. The transaction is carried out by way of increasing MPC Capital's shareholding in MPC CSI GmbH (""MPC CSI""). MPC CSI was established in 2017 as a joint investment vehicle for the IPO of MPCC under the leadership of MPC Capital and MPC Münchmeyer Petersen & Co. GmbH  the founder and largest shareholder of MPC Capital. The purchase price for the acquisition of the shares from the selling shareholders of MPC CSI is approximately EUR 34 million and is based on a net price per MPCC share of NOK 13.60 (USD 1.31). Following the transaction  MPC CSI will own around 17% of MPCC's shares  of which around 14% will be held by MPC Capital. With a fleet of 62 vessels  MPCC is one of the world's largest owners of container ships for intraregional trades. In the 2023 financial year  it reported operating revenues of USD 711 million and earnings per share of USD 0.73. The dividend yield in 2023 was 43%. Regular returns from the investment are also expected for 2024 and subsequent years. Against this background  MPC Capital is increasing its earnings forecast for 2024 and now expects earnings before taxes to be slightly above the already high level of EUR 19.3 million in the 2023 financial year. Previously  MPC Capital had assumed that earnings would only be at the high level of the previous year. The forecast for consolidated revenue remains unchanged. Contact and disclosing person pursuant to Article 17 of MARMPC Capital AGStefan ZenkerHead of Investor Relations & Public RelationsTel. +49 40 38022-4347Mail: s.zenker@mpc-capital.comEnd of Inside InformationInformation and Explanation of the Issuer to this announcement:MPCC was initiated by MPC Capital and listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange in 2017. From an initial opportunistic investment strategy focused on the strong upside potential of asset values in the market segment for smaller container vessels  MPCC has since developed into a leading global provider of feeder container tonnage. Today  MPCC is included in Oslo Stock Exchange's OBX  an index of the 25 most liquid companies. Due to its dynamic development  MPCC has steadily increased in strategic importance for MPC Capital. MPC Capital is involved in the technical and commercial management of the MPCC fleet and regularly participates in acquisitions  sales and newbuilding projects. Through its investment in MPCC  MPC Capital benefits from regular  high returns based on MPCC's attractive dividend policy with a payout ratio of 75% of net profit. The medium-term outlook for the market segment for smaller container ships remains positive. On the supply side  the orderbook for new vessels in this market segment is limited and the existing fleet is characterized by a high average age. At the same time  demand for ship transport in intra-regional trades is expected to be a relatively dynamic. In addition  efforts to meet global climate targets are increasing the demand for investment in the decarbonization of maritime infrastructure. MPCC is excellently positioned in this market with industry-low leverage and high earnings visibility from existing charter agreements. MPC Capital believes it is ideally positioned to further develop its business. In this context  MPC Capital sees attractive investment opportunities  particularly due to the high demand for investments in relation to the energy transition  but also due to opportunities arising from market uncertainties and lower asset values.This release contains forward-looking statements that are subject to certain risks and uncertainties. Future results could differ materially from those currently anticipated due to various risk factors and uncertainties  including  among others  changes in business  economic and competitive conditions  foreign exchange rate fluctuations  uncertainties in litigation or investigative proceedings  and the availability of financing.

The tobacco giant explained that the sale would be composed of public offerings of ADRs and ABI ordinary shares in the U.S.  as well as a concurrent private placement of ABI ordinary shares in the European Economic Area and the U.K. In addition  ABI ordinary shares  including those represented by ADRs  would be offered in countries outside the U.S. Altria plans to allow the underwriters to purchase an additional 5.25 million ABI shares within 30 days of the offering.AB InBev explained the shares would be priced at EUR56.17 ($61.26) per ordinary share  and $61.50 per ADR. That would be about 5% below Wednesday's closing price in the U.S. of $64.55. The beer maker added that it plans to buy 3.34 million ordinary shares for $200 million.The move would raise about $2.2 billion for Altria. The company noted that it expects to use the cash generated to buy back its own shares. CEO Billy Gifford said Altria believes “this is an opportunistic transaction that realizes a portion of the substantial return on our long-term investment.”A year ago  AB InBev shares plunged after a boycott of its Bud Light brand sparked by the company's work with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney. Soon thereafter  Bud Light lost its title as best-selling U.S. beer brand to Constellation Brands’ (STZ) Modelo Especial. Sales of Bud Light have yet to recover  although AB InBev’s overall revenue in 2023 was up 7.8%.AB InBev ADRs were down 5.9% at $60.75 at around 1:40 p.m. ET Thursday  while Altria shares were up 1.6% at $44.03.,neutral,0.04,0.96,0.01,negative,0.01,0.23,0.76,True,English,"['AB InBev Stock Falls', 'Bud Light Maker', 'Altria', 'Plans', 'Sells', 'Shares', 'selling U.S. beer brand', 'additional 5.25 million ABI shares', '195 million ABI shares', 'American Depositary Receipts', 'concurrent private placement', 'European Economic Area', 'CEO Billy Gifford', 'STZ) Modelo Especial', 'Bud Light brand', '3.34 million ordinary shares', 'ABI ordinary shares', 'global secondary offering', 'Key Takeaways Altria', 'U.S. Altria', 'AB InBev shares', 'Bud Light sales', 'AB InBev ADRs', 'U.K.', 'beer maker', 'Anheuser-Busch InBev', 'Altria shares', 'tobacco giant', 'transgender influencer', 'Dylan Mulvaney', 'Euronext exchange', 'public offerings', 'opportunistic transaction', 'substantial return', 'long-term investment', 'overall revenue', 'Altria (MO', 'closing price', 'part', '10% stake', 'proceeds', 'loss', 'boycott', 'relationship', 'countries', 'underwriters', '30 days', 'Wednesday', 'move', 'company', 'cash', 'portion', 'work', 'title', '1:40']",2024-03-14,2024-03-15,investopedia.com

(Altria) (NYSE: MO) today announced that it has agreed to sell 35 million shares of Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (ABI) (NYSE: BUD) (Euronext: ABI) (MEXBOL: ANB) (JSE: ANH) through a global secondary offering (offering) comprised of a public offering of ABI ordinary shares represented by American depositary shares (ADS) in the United States  a public offering of ABI ordinary shares in the United States  a concurrent private placement of ABI ordinary shares in the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom and an offering of ABI ordinary shares  including ABI ordinary shares represented by ADSs  in other countries outside the United States  at a price of $61.50 per ADS  corresponding to €56.17 per ABI ordinary share. In addition  ABI will repurchase $200 million of ordinary shares directly from Altria  concurrently with  and conditional on  completion of the offering. The aggregate amount of the offering and repurchase by ABI is approximately $2.4 billion. Altria has also granted the underwriters an option to purchase up to 5.25 million additional ABI shares owned by Altria at the price per ADS paid by the underwriters in the offering  exercisable within the next 30 days.In connection with the pricing of the offering  we announce a $2.4 billion increase to our existing $1 billion share repurchase program. Our Board of Directors (Board) has authorized the expanded program  which we expect to complete by December 31  2024. Share repurchases depend on marketplace conditions and other factors  and the program remains subject to the discretion of our Board. As part of the expanded share repurchase program  we expect to enter into an estimated $2.4 billion accelerated share repurchase (ASR) program. We expect cash savings from the elimination of future dividend payments on the repurchased shares.“These opportunistic capital allocation decisions reflect our ongoing confidence in Altria’s future and the significant value offered in our shares today ” said Billy Gifford  Altria’s Chief Executive Officer. “We have a longstanding history of returning cash to our shareholders  and today’s announcement reflects our continued desire to create long-term shareholder value.”This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy the securities described herein  nor shall there be any offer or sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer  solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.Partial Sale of Our Investment in ABIOur remaining ownership of ABI after the offering and the share repurchase by ABI will be approximately 8.1% (or approximately 7.8% assuming full exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares). We estimate that we will own approximately 159 million shares of ABI (or approximately 154 million shares of ABI assuming full exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares) following the offering and the share repurchase by ABI.In conjunction with the offering  we have agreed to a 180-day lockup with the lead underwriter for our remaining ABI shares.We expect to maintain two seats on ABI’s board of directors through ABI’s 2025 annual general meeting. Following such meeting  we expect to have one seat on ABI’s board of directors  in accordance with our rights as a holder of restricted shares.Following the offering  we expect to continue to use the equity method of accounting for our investment in ABI.Financial Flexibility and Cash Returns to ShareholdersWe expect cash savings from the elimination of future dividend payments on the repurchased shares of our common stock. These cash savings may be used for general corporate purposes including investments in our Vision  debt repayment or further cash returns to shareholders.We remain committed to our progressive dividend goal that targets mid-single digits dividend per share growth annually through 2028. Future dividend payments remain subject to the discretion of our Board.2024 Full-Year GuidanceWe expect the combined transactions will be accretive to our 2024 full-year adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS). Therefore  we raise our guidance for 2024 full-year adjusted diluted EPS to be in a range of $5.05 to $5.17  representing a growth rate of 2% to 4.5% from a base of $4.95 in 2023  to reflect our estimate for lower 2024 weighted-average shares outstanding  partially offset by lower equity earnings related to the reduced ownership of our investment in ABI. We expect 2024 adjusted diluted EPS growth to be weighted to the second half of the year. Our guidance includes the impact of two additional shipping days in 2024 and assumes limited impact from enforcement efforts in the illicit e-vapor market on combustible and e-vapor volumes.While the 2024 full-year adjusted diluted EPS guidance accounts for a range of scenarios  the external environment remains dynamic. We will continue to monitor conditions related to (i) the economy  including the cumulative impact of inflation  (ii) adult tobacco consumer dynamics  including purchasing patterns and adoption of smoke-free products  (iii) illicit e-vapor enforcement and (iv) regulatory  litigation and legislative developments.Our 2024 full-year adjusted diluted EPS guidance range includes planned investments in support of our Vision  such as (i) marketplace activities in support of our smoke-free products and (ii) continued smoke-free product research  development and regulatory preparation expenses.The 2024 full-year adjusted diluted EPS guidance range excludes estimated net income of approximately $0.2 billion (or $0.12 per share) that we expect to record in the first quarter of 2024 for the partial sale of our investment in ABI. This estimated net income is subject to certain adjustments  including any exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares  adjustments related to the conversion from international financial reporting standards to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and adjustments required under the equity method of accounting. Additionally  the guidance excludes an estimated per share gain of $1.17 related to the sale of the IQOS Tobacco Heating System commercialization rights that we expect to record in the second quarter of 2024.Our full-year adjusted diluted EPS guidance range excludes the impact of certain income and expense items that our management believes are not part of underlying operations. These items may include  for example  loss on early extinguishment of debt  restructuring charges  asset impairment charges  acquisition  disposition and integration-related items  equity investment-related special items  certain income tax items  charges associated with tobacco and health and certain other litigation items  and resolutions of certain non-participating manufacturer (NPM) adjustment disputes under the MSA (NPM Adjustment Items).Our management cannot estimate on a forward-looking basis the impact of certain income and expense items  including those items noted in the preceding paragraph  on our reported diluted EPS because these items  which could be significant  may be unusual or infrequent  are difficult to predict and may be highly variable. As a result  we do not provide a corresponding GAAP measure for  or reconciliation to  our adjusted diluted EPS guidance.Forward-Looking and Cautionary StatementsThis release contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Consequently  you should not consider the foregoing list complete. We do not undertake to update any forward-looking statement that we may make from time to time except as required by applicable law.

Our management does not view any of these special items to be part of our underlying results as they may be highly variable  may be unusual or infrequent  are difficult to predict and can distort underlying business trends and results. Our management believes that adjusted financial measures provide useful additional insight into underlying business trends and results and provide a more meaningful comparison of year-over-year results. Our management uses adjusted financial measures for planning  forecasting and evaluating business and financial performance  including allocating capital and other resources and evaluating results relative to employee compensation targets. These adjusted financial measures are not required by  or calculated in accordance with GAAP and may not be calculated the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. These adjusted financial measures should thus be considered as supplemental in nature and not considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP.View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240313960468/en/Altria Client ServicesInvestor Relations804-484-8222Altria Client ServicesMedia Relations804-484-8897,neutral,0.03,0.97,0.0,negative,0.01,0.26,0.73,True,English,"['Expanded Share Repurchase Program', 'Anheuser-Busch InBev Stock', '2024 Full-Year Earnings Guidance', 'Cash Returns', 'Altria', 'Shareholders', 'Connection', 'Pricing', 'Offering', 'existing $1 billion share repurchase program', 'opportunistic capital allocation decisions', '2024 full-year adjusted diluted earnings', '2024 full-year adjusted diluted EPS', '2024 adjusted diluted EPS growth', '$2.4 billion accelerated share repurchase', 'two additional shipping days', 'Expanded Share Repurchase Program', '5.25 million additional ABI shares', 'Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV', 'concurrent private placement', 'European Economic Area', 'Chief Executive Officer', 'general corporate purposes', 'illicit e-vapor market', 'progressive dividend goal', 'Anheuser-Busch InBev Stock', 'long-term shareholder value', 'American depositary shares', '2024 weighted-average shares outstanding', '2024 Full-Year Earnings Guidance', 'future dividend payments', '2025 annual general meeting', 'lower equity earnings', 'ABI ordinary share', 'global secondary offering', 'remaining ABI shares', '$2.4 billion increase', 'share growth', 'additional shares', 'ordinary shares', 'next 30 days', 'two seats', '2024 Full-Year Guidance', '35 million shares', '159 million shares', '154 million shares', 'Share repurchases', 'ASR) program', 'growth rate', 'significant value', 'remaining ownership', 'equity method', 'common stock', 'restricted shares', 'United States', 'United Kingdom', 'other countries', 'aggregate amount', 'marketplace conditions', 'other factors', 'ongoing confidence', 'Billy Gifford', 'longstanding history', 'continued desire', 'press release', 'full exercise', '180-day lockup', 'lead underwriter', 'one seat', 'Financial Flexibility', 'debt repayment', 'mid-single digits', 'combined transactions', 'reduced ownership', 'second half', 'enforcement efforts', 'Cash Returns', 'cash savings', 'limited impact', 'securities laws', 'Partial Sale', 'public offering', 'underwriters’ option', 'Altria Group', 'Shareholders', 'Connection', 'Pricing', 'NYSE', 'BUD', 'Euronext', 'MEXBOL', 'ANB', 'JSE', 'ADS', 'price', 'completion', 'Board', 'Directors', 'December', 'discretion', 'elimination', 'announcement', 'solicitation', 'jurisdiction', 'registration', 'qualification', 'Investment', 'conjunction', 'accordance', 'rights', 'Vision', 'range', 'base', 'estimate', 'combustible']",2024-03-14,2024-03-15,investorsobserver.com

Consolidated results achieved by Biesse Group in the 12 months of 2023: Consolidated net revenues of 785.0 million euros (-4.6% compared to 2022 and -5.8% compared to 2021)(-4.6% compared to 2022 and -5.8% compared to 2021) EBITDA of 77.0 million euros (-14.9% compared to 2022)  9.8% of revenues (11% in 2022)(-14.9% compared to 2022)  9.8% of revenues (11% in 2022) EBIT before non-recurring events of 40.4 million euros (47.6 million euros in 2022)  5.1% of revenues (5.8% in 2022)non-recurring events of 40.4 million euros (47.6 million euros in 2022)  5.1% of revenues (5.8% in 2022) EBIT after non-recurring events of 24.2 million euros (50.7 million euros in 2022) 3.1% of revenues (6.2% in 2022)non-recurring events of 24.2 million euros (50.7 million euros in 2022) 3.1% of revenues (6.2% in 2022) Net profit of 12.5 million euros (30.3 million euros in 2022)  1.6% of revenues - EPS (net profit per share) 0.46 eurosTax rate 39.0% (27.2% in 2022) Net Financial Position As of 31 December 2023  the Group Net Financial Position was positive for 93.0 million euros  including the impact of 25.5 million euros (higher payables) deriving from the application of IFRS16.

Comment of Biesse Group Chief Financial Officer: ""The results achieved during the past year and approved today - comments following the Board of Directors' meeting the Group's CFO Pierre La Tour - bear testimony to how Biesse has been affected by the negative dynamics of the global demand for biesse.comcapital goods  closing - as expected - 2023 with lower volumes versus 2022  which was an exceptional year. The cautious approach adopted by Biesse is proving to be the most adequate to face the challenges of the current global scenario  characterized by persistent uncertainties in the international context  the slowdown of demand  the continuation during 2023 of restrictive monetary policies that are impacting interest rates and the reshaping of government incentives that have stimulated our domestic market over recent years. These several factors do not allow for optimistic projections in the immediate future. From a business point of view  the order portfolio at the end of 2023 has decreased versus 2022 - when the historical maximum level was reached - and has been affected by a changing and worsened economic scenario. Being unable to govern exogenous inflationary pressures  we will continue to pursue efficiency actions within our structure  in continuity with the execution of the One Company project  introducing a higher level of flexibility  optimization of costs and a swift simplification of our business processes"". Regarding the acquisition of GMM Group  completed in January  the Group CEO Roberto Selci said: ""The entrance of GMM in the Group will allow us to complete our stone-working product portfolio and to further increase our offering of machinery and instruments for glass-working and other materials' processing segments by integrating the technologies of a leading company in our productions  thus enhancing the presence  productivity and flexibility of our group. We will continue to promote innovation and research since we are convinced that these are essential principles of our strategy  implementing new technical solutions that are based on connectivity and automation  for a sustainable development. Our cash position remains positive  and represents an important base biesse.comto sustain our organic growth and our future expansion through acquisitions"". Order backlog At the end of 2023  the order backlog amounted to 278.4 million euros (-38.3% compared to the same date of 2022 and -35.6% compared to the same date of 2021). The order intake for the full year 2023 decreased by 13.3% compared to 2022 and by 24.1% compared to 2021. In the fourth quarter of 2023 alone  order intake was lower than the same period in 2022 (-11.5%).

A suitable auditor that is qualified to provide these services in the countries where VEON operates has not yet been identified.As a result of the anticipated delays in its filings  the Company expects that it will not be in compliance with its listing requirements once the applicable deadlines have passed  and will focus on regaining compliance as soon as practicable.VEON also expects to be delayed in delivering the audited consolidated financial statements of its subsidiary  VEON Holdings BV  to the holders of the outstanding notes of VEON Holdings BV (the “VEON Holdings Notes”) and its revolving credit facility (the “RCF”) creditors  as well as in the delivery of the Company’s 2023 audited financials to the RCF creditors. The Company will seek consents from its RCF creditors and the holders of the VEON Holdings Notes for the delayed delivery of the audited financial statements.The Company will provide further updates in the future on its progress and the status of the matters mentioned herein.

If you are in any doubt about the action you should take  you should seek advice from a financial adviser authorised u…,The Scrip Dividend SchemeTerms in upper case have the meanings given to them on pages 9 and 10SEGRO plc's shares are admitted to trading on both the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange (LSE) and Euronext  Paris.The following information applies to shareholders who hold their shares directly and via Euroclear UK & Ireland  the clearing and settlement system for the LSE  and to those shareholders who hold their shares via Euroclear France  the clearing and settlement system for Euronext Paris  unless otherwise specified:1. What is the Scrip Dividend Scheme?The Scrip Dividend Scheme provides you with an opportunity to receive New Ordinary Shares instead of cash in respect of the 2023 Final Dividend of 19.1 pence per Ordinary Share and for all future Ordinary Dividends and Property Income Distributions (PID) for which a Scrip Dividend Alternative is offered.The Scrip Dividend Scheme allows you to increase your shareholding in the Company without incurring dealing costs or stamp duty. In addition  we will retain more cash for reinvestment in SEGRO plc.The issue of New Ordinary Shares under the Scrip Dividend Scheme may  as with cash dividends paid by the Company  be treated as a PID or an Ordinary Dividend  as specified by the Company for each Relevant Dividend. If specified as a PID  the distribution may be subject to withholding tax. Confirmation of whether PID or Ordinary Dividend treatment will apply will be given via a Regulatory Information Service provider and on the Company's website prior to the relevant Ex-dividend Date.2. Who can join the Scrip Dividend Scheme?All shareholders who are resident in the United Kingdom can join the Scrip Dividend Scheme. Details regarding participation by Overseas Shareholders are set out at question 23.3. How do I join the Scheme?If  after you have read this document  you wish to join the Scrip Dividend Scheme  please complete the Mandate Form available at www.SEGRO.com/investors/shareholder-information/dividend-information and return it to Equiniti.Mandate Forms must be received by Equiniti no later than the date advised by the Company to be eligible for that particular dividend. Details of the Relevant Dividend Payment Date  Ex-dividend Date and Record Date for each Relevant Dividend can be obtained from the Company's website at www.SEGRO.com  from the documentation provided to shareholders by the Company in respect of that dividend via a Regulatory Information Service provider  or by contacting Equiniti using the contact details set out on page 2.Please see question 12 for further information on the Mandate Form.Alternatively  CREST members should make an election via Euroclear UK & Ireland  as further set out at question 17. Please refer to question 27 if you hold your shares via Euroclear France.4. I am a participant in the 2021 Scheme - do I need to rejoin the Scrip Dividend Scheme?If you chose to make an evergreen election in relation to the 2021 Scheme (and such instruction has not been cancelled) then you will continue to receive New Ordinary Shares instead of cash dividends as a matter of routine in respect of all future Relevant Dividends  until such instruction is subsequently cancelled. You do not therefore need to return a Mandate Form or CREST electronic election in order to participate in the Scrip Dividend Scheme.If you participated in the 2021 Scheme but did not choose to make an evergreen election  or if you chose to make an evergreen election in relation to the 2021 Scheme and such instruction has since been cancelled  then you will need to return a Mandate Form or CREST electronic election if you wish to participate in the Scrip Dividend Scheme.Please refer to question 27 if you hold your shares via Euroclear France or if you chose to participate in the 2021 Scheme and have subsequently transferred your shares to be held via Euroclear France.5. How many New Ordinary Shares will I receive?The number of New Ordinary Shares you will receive in respect of the Relevant Dividend will be calculated by multiplying the cash value of the proposed interim or final dividend per Ordinary Share and the number of Ordinary Shares registered in your name at the Record Date and dividing the result by the Scrip Calculation Price.The Scrip Calculation Price will be the average of the middle market quotations for Ordinary Shares on the LSE for the five business days commencing on a date to be determined by the Company  such date to be no earlier than the Ex-dividend Date. In respect of the 2023 Final Dividend  this period will be 14 March 2024 to 20 March 2024 inclusive. The Scrip Calculation Price will be announced to the LSE on 21 March 2024 and detailed on the Shareholder Information section of the Company's website  www.SEGRO.com.No fractions of shares will be allotted. Unless you hold your shares via Euroclear France  any Cash Balance will be carried forward  without interest  and included in the calculation of your next scrip dividend payment. For an explanation of the Cash Balance  please see question 7 below (question 28 if you hold your shares via Euroclear France). The calculation of your entitlement to New Ordinary Shares will also be subject to rounding to ensure that it is  as nearly as possible  equal to the cash dividend or PID.,neutral,0.01,0.98,0.01,neutral,0.03,0.94,0.03,True,English,"['Scrip Dividend Scheme Booklet', 'SEGRO', 'March', '10:53', 'Regulatory Information Service provider', 'next scrip dividend payment', 'The Scrip Calculation Price', 'The Scrip Dividend Scheme', 'many New Ordinary Shares', 'Relevant Dividend Payment Date', 'Scrip Dividend Alternative', 'London Stock Exchange', 'Property Income Distributions', 'five business days', 'Shareholder Information section', 'middle market quotations', 'Ordinary Dividend treatment', 'future Ordinary Dividends', 'future Relevant Dividends', 'CREST electronic election', 'relevant Ex-dividend Date', 'following information', '2023 Final Dividend', 'particular dividend', 'CREST members', 'Main Market', 'cash dividends', 'evergreen election', 'upper case', 'Euroclear UK', 'settlement system', 'Euroclear France', 'dealing costs', 'stamp duty', 'withholding tax', 'United Kingdom', 'Mandate Form', 'Record Date', 'cash value', 'Cash Balance', 'SEGRO plc', 'SEGRO.com', 'contact details', 'Overseas Shareholders', 'Euronext Paris', '2021 Scheme', 'Terms', 'meanings', 'pages', 'LSE', 'Ireland', 'clearing', 'opportunity', 'respect', '19.1 pence', 'PID', 'shareholding', 'Company', 'addition', 'reinvestment', 'issue', 'Confirmation', 'website', 'participation', 'question', 'document', 'investors/shareholder-information/dividend-information', 'Equiniti', 'participant', 'relation', 'instruction', 'matter', 'routine', 'order', 'number', 'interim', 'name', 'result', 'average', 'period', 'March', 'fractions', 'interest', 'explanation']",2024-03-14,2024-03-15,marketscreener.com

Using the innovative WAGABOX® technology  developed and patented by Waga Energy  the plant recovers the gas spontaneously emitted by landfilled waste in the form of RNG  a renewable substitute for fossil-based natural gas. Its renewable gas production is injected directly into the local gas grid to supply homes and businesses.The WAGABOX® unit at Sainte-Marie-Kerque can process 500 scfm (800 m3/h)  and produce up to 120 000 MMBtu (35 GWh) of RNG per year  depending on the concentration of methane in the raw gas. At its maximum capacity  it can supply around 5 500 households and avoid the emission of 5 800 tons of CO2 equivalent per year into the atmosphere  through the substitution of fossil-based natural gas in the grid[1].The gas emitted at the Sainte-Marie-Kerque landfill was previously upgraded by a power engine. The WAGABOX® unit will significantly increase the landfill energy production  providing energy that will help to decarbonize sectors such as transport and industry – still totally dependent on fossil fuels.Maxime Séché  Chief Executive Officer of Séché Environnement  said: ""This RNG production plant illustrates the Séché Environnement group’s commitment to circular economy and ecological transition of territories and industries. It is part of the group’s decarbonization strategy presented in February 2022  and its ambition to curb its greenhouse gas emissions by 25% by 2030.""Mathieu Lefebvre  Chief Executive Officer of Waga Energy  said: ""Thanks to the WAGABOX® technology  the Sainte-Marie-Kerque landfill has become a RNG producer  and now supplies the local community with low-carbon energy. We are delighted about – and proud of – this first collaboration with the Séché Environnement group  a long-standing and recognized player in waste management  strongly committed to fighting global warming and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.""About Séché EnvironnementSéché Environnement is a leading player in waste management  including the most complex and hazardous waste  and in environmental services  particularly in the event of an environmental emergency.

This second supply agreement from PanTera underscores its commitment to enabling the advancement of transformative cancer treatments and reflects the growing demand for 225Ac in cutting-edge clinical trials.Under the terms of the agreement  PanTera will provide 225Ac to its partner for at least the next 2 years  with options for future prolongation. This important contract represents 15% to 20% of the yearly volumes PanTera will be producing based on the thorium-229 (229Th) to be provided by TerraPower. Financial terms of the contract are not disclosed.This new agreement reflects PanTera’s unique position as a reliable  long-term  EU-based supplier of 225Ac. Over the next 5 years  the company will continue to work on securing and increasing access to 225Ac for clinical trial needs  as well as the construction of a large-scale  state-of-the-art production facility to address the growing global demand.Sven Van den Berghe  CEO of PanTera  commented  “We welcome this second strategic supply contract as a confirmation of our chosen strategy. Providing 225Ac as from this year is extremely important to support the industry in its development and qualification of these promising treatments in the fight against cancer. In the meantime  PanTera is progressing rapidly towards launching its large-scale production to meet the anticipated significant global radioisotope demand increase once targeted 225Ac-based therapeutics are approved in 4-5 years.”225Ac is an alpha-emitter which  when attached to a tumour-seeking vector  can deliver therapeutic doses of radiation directly to tumours and metastases  destroying the cancer cells while sparing the surrounding healthy tissue. It is widely regarded as an isotope with tremendous potential in Targeted Alpha Therapy (TAT) across a range of cancer types. Whilst there is high demand for 225Ac for clinical trial today  there is already a global supply shortage. PanTera was launched by IBA and SCK CEN in 2022 to address this supply issue both in the short and the long term.***About PanTeraPanTera  an IBA and SCK CEN joint-venture  aims to secure the large-scale production of actinium-225 (225Ac)  one of the most promising alpha-emitting radioisotopes to fight cancers. By working towards this large-scale production  PanTera’s ultimate goal is to improve the accessibility of future innovative cancer therapy based on 225Ac and theranostics in general.More information can be found at: www.pantera-life.comAbout IBAIBA (Ion Beam Applications S.A.) is the world leader in particle accelerator technology.

SQLI  a European digital services group  announces its annual results for 2023  as approved by the Board of Directors at its meeting on 12 March 2024 chaired by Philippe Donche-Gay[1]. On this occasion  the Group announces a sequential improvement in its results during 2023  as well as several strategic initiatives to strengthen its position as a key player in the digital experience market  and unveils its financial ambitions for 2024.In €m – IFRS – Audited data 2022 2023 Change REVENUE 245.9 251.2 +2% CURRENT OPERATING INCOME 21.5 20.6 -4% 8.7% 8.2% -0.5 pt OPERATING INCOME (EBIT) 16.2 12.4 -23% NET INCOME 7.7 4.8 -37%SEQUENTIAL IMPROVEMENT IN RESULTS BETWEEN THE 1ST HALF AND THE 2ND HALF OF 2023SQLI has posted a 3rd consecutive year of growth  with consolidated revenues up organically by +2% to €251.2m (also +2% at constant exchange rates). France (+2.3%) and international markets (+2.0%) contributed equally to the Group's revenue growth.Current operating income fell slightly (-4%) in 2023  reflecting a two-stage trend. After a 1.3 point decline in the current operating margin on ordinary activities in the first half of 2023[2]  due to a temporary deterioration in the level of activity  profitability improved by 0.2 point in the second half of 2023[3]  returning to 8.7% of revenues  the level achieved for the whole of 2022.This turnaround demonstrates the relevance of the strategic choices made at the start of the year  particularly the implementation in France of a new organization based on areas of expertise  following a model that is also being rolled out internationally. The Group has also invested to strengthen its technological expertise  its commercial efficiency  and the development of its service centre in Morocco.Operating income (EBIT) came to €12.4m  after considering €8.2m of net non-current expenses (around half of which related to the recognition  with limited impact on cash  of the long-term incentive plan introduced in 2022 and expenses associated with the change of head office in Levallois).After taking into account the net cost of debt (€4.4m in 2023 compared with €4.0m in 2022) and the tax expense (€2.7m compared with €3.4m)  consolidated net income for 2023 is €4.8m.CONTROL OF THE NET DEBT/EQUITY RATIOSQLI had gross cash of €15.7m[4] at the end of 2023  compared with €22.2m at the start of the year. The change was mainly due to less recourse to deconsolidating factoring (€4.0m) and to the fitting-out of the new head office (€2.5m).Net financial debt (excluding IFRS 16) remains low and under control  at €11.7m  compared with equity of €117.2m  giving a ratio of around 10%.3 STRATEGIC OPERATIONS LAUNCHED IN EARLY 2024On the strength of these solid results and a good business momentum at the start of the year  SQLI has decided to embark on a new development cycle combining organic growth  refocusing on its core activities and targeted acquisitions. This roadmap has resulted in 3 strategic initiatives since the beginning of the year:The acquisition of Levana[5]  an independent French agency founded in 2017 with a team of 70 employees and a benchmark in the Salesforce ecosystem  the world leader in customer relationship management solutions. The planned acquisition of Station 10[6]  a London agency with 25 talented people and recognised for its cutting-edge expertise in analysing data from Adobe's cloud platforms. The proposed sale of Aston[7]  a training business that is not part of the strategic roadmap and which will be acquired by a training specialist  the Talis Education Group.These operations are designed to consolidate SQLI's position as a benchmark partner for the world's leading providers of experience platforms (Adobe  Microsoft  Salesforce  and SAP). They will improve the SQLI Group's growth profile  while consolidating the proportion of activities generating a double-digit recurring operating margin. In 2024  the impacts of the acquisitions and disposals will offset each other overall  in terms of both income statement and cash flow.AMBITION FOR PROFITABLE GROWTH IN 2024Between 2020 and 2023  SQLI will have increased its revenues by an average of 5.5% a year and raised its current operating margin from 3.4% to 8.2% of revenues.The Group aims to continue this cycle in 2024  with faster revenues growth than in 2023 and a further improvement in profitability  enabling it to achieve a double-digit current operating margin.Receive SQLI financial news free of charge by email by signing on at : www.actusnews.comAbout SQLI : Founded in 1990  SQLI is a European digital services group that supports major international brands in creating value through Digital.

Following discussions with the Belgian Financial Services and Markets Authority (FSMA) and Hyloris‘ statutory auditor  the Board of Directors has revised the financial statements due to the correction of a non-cash accounting error regarding the divestment of HY-038 and acquisition of HY-088.Clarification on the press release of 20 January 2023 on the transactions with QliniqOn 20 January 2023 Hyloris announced that the global rights of the ongoing development of HY-088 was licensed-in from a Dutch company  Qliniq  who maintained the rights to commercialize the product candidate in its home country  and a selected number of Middle Eastern and developing countries. In the same press release  Hyloris announced that it had divested HY-038 to the same company  Qliniq  for a price of EUR 1 million.As detailed in the 2022 Annual Report  HY-038 falls under the category of high-barrier generics and thus lies beyond Hyloris’ core portfolio of assets. Limited development activities had occurred for HY-038 since the IPO and the product was no longer under development at the time of the closing of the transaction with Qliniq. Hyloris encountered challenges in identifying a suitable Contract Manufacturing Organization (CMO) capable of producing HY-038 at a desired cost. The transaction price of € 1 million was received on 16 February 2023.HY-088 is a ready-to-administer oral liquid formulation designed for addressing hypophosphatemia. Presently  physicians utilize compounded products for treating this condition  which have not undergone regulatory evaluation regarding their safety  effectiveness  and quality. At the time of the transaction  QliniQ held no exclusive rights to develop the oral liquid formulation and had not initiated any significant development activities on HY-088.It is expected that Hyloris will submit HY-088 for registration in the course of 2025. The transaction price of €1.2 million (including €200 thousand designated as prepaid expenses)  was paid by Hyloris on 13 February 2023.QliniQ is a Dutch company which develops and in-licenses drugs and medical supplies in various therapeutic domains and commercializes these in the Netherlands. QliniQ nurtures cooperation and long-lasting business relationships with international companies as part of its successful market approach. At December 31  2022  Qliniq had a balance sheet total of € 0.8 million  a cash balance of € 0.2 million and 2 FTE’s. Qliniq’s shareholders have previously successfully developed several pharmaceutical companies.Accounting treatment of the transactions with QliniqHyloris initially recognized (a) €1 million in revenue in 2022 from the divestment of HY-038  and (b) € 1 million in R&D expenses and € 0 2 million in intangible assets in H1 2023 for the purchase of HY-088. A reassessment determined that both transactions qualify as a non-monetary exchange because negotiations and valuations occurred simultaneously. Due to the development stage of the products exchanged  the fair value of neither the asset received  nor the asset given up can be reliably determined. As a result of this reassessment  the restated financials for 2022 will reverse the €1 million revenue from the divestment of HY-038. This adjustment will also affect the half-year 2023 financial statements  resulting in a reversal of €1 million in R&D expenses for HY-088. These expenses are offset against the €1 million received by Hyloris for HY-038.The following tables summarize the impact of the restatement on the consolidated financial statements.Consolidated statement of financial positionPer 31 December 2022(in € thousands)Impact of Restatement As previously reported Adjustment As restated Current assets 50.801 -1.000 49.801 Trade and other receivables 5.127 -1.000 4.127 Total assets 61.864 -1.000 60.864 Equity 55.045 -1.000 54.045 Result of the period (10.770) -1.000 (11.770) Total equity and liabilities 61.864 -1.000 60.864Consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive incomeFor the year ended 31 December 2022(in € thousands)Impact of Restatement As previously reported Adjustment As restated Revenues 2.951 -1.000 1.951 Gross profit 2.857 -1.000 1.857 Operating profit/(loss) (EBIT) (10.638) -1.000 (11.638) Profit (loss) before taxes (10.766) -1.000 (11.766) PROFIT (LOSS) FOR THE PERIOD (10.770) -1.000 (11.770) TOTAL COMPREHENSIVE INCOME FOR THE PERIOD (10.770) -1.000 (11.770)For the year ended 31 December 2022(in €)Impact of Restatement As previously reported Adjustment As restated Basic/diluted earnings/(loss) per share (0.380) (0.035) (0.435)Consolidated statement of cash flowsEven though there was an actual cash inflow of € 1 million from the divestment of HY-038 and a cash outflow of € 1.2 million resulting from the in-licensing of HY-088  the transactions are presented in the net consolidated cash flow statement for the year ended per December 31  2023 (i.e.  € 200k prepaid expenses)  as this most faithfully presents the substance of the transactions.

The transformation initiated three years ago on both the offers and the revenue model has enabled a stabilisation of revenue and an improvement in EBITDA. Due to changes in market conditions over the past two years  the ambitions for 2025 will take more time to achieve. In 2024  the teams remain focused on increasing recurring revenues to above 50% of total revenue  and on profitability. The cost structure will largely ensure future growth  which will be driven in particular by Extended Threat Defense and by an expansion of customers in the banking  insurance and automotive sectors ” says Amedeo D’Angelo  Executive Chairman of VERIMATRIX.***Amedeo D’Angelo  Chairman and CEO  and Jean-François Labadie  Chief Financial Officer  will host a webcast today at 6.00 p.m. to present the 2023 results and the outlook for 2024.To join the webcast  click on the following link: Webcast - Verimatrix 2023 annual results To join the webcast in audio only  call the following number:France: +33 (0) 4 88 80 09 30Phone Conference ID: 748 635 38#***Revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2023: $17m  +6%(US$ million) Q4 23 Q4 22 Var.

Revenue from subscriptions increased by 32% to $3.7 million. Maintenance revenue was down 9% to $4.0 million.Non-recurring revenueAfter three quarters of decline  non-recurring revenue rose by 5% to $9.3 million despite a decline having also been expected for the fourth quarter. This performance can be attributed to good momentum in perpetual license sales to historical customers in the Latin America region.2023 revenue stabilised  in a context of transformation at many levels(US$ million) 2023 2022 Var.

This can be attributed to growth of 69% in subscriptions to $13.8 million  in line with the Group’s strategy and the growth target communicated during the half-year results of more than 60%  following an upward revision (>+40% initially).Growth was driven by embedded revenues at the end of December 2022  combined with the activation of new contracts signed during 2023  particularly in new sectors such as financial services and automotive.Non-recurring revenueIn accordance with the strategy to transform the model of direct license sales to one of recurring revenue  non-recurring revenue continued to decline to $31.0 million. Non-recurring revenue was penalised by a drop in royalties from set-top boxes  while revenue from video content protection licenses was up slightly. During 2023  VERIMATRIX won a tender in Brazil and continued to sell perpetual licenses to its existing customers (India  Europe and Latin America).ARRARR at the year-end amounted to $31.1 million  51% of total revenue  an increase of 13%  ensuring visibility on revenue and an improvement in future profitability.ARR from subscriptions amounted to $14.8 million  up by a strong 34%  despite the deferral of contract signatures to the first quarter of 2024.- Revenue by activityAnti-Piracy revenueThe Anti-Piracy activity (93% of VERIMATRIX’s total revenue in 2023)  which covers telecoms  broadcasting  streaming media and pay TV operators  offers security solutions for the protection of content that detect and prevent piracy at each stage of a broadcast  even before the content reaches the customer’s device. As an ISO-certified company (9001 and 27001)  VERIMATRIX’s security solutions help companies comply with and meet regulatory standards in the most demanding industries  such as media and entertainment  telecommunications  finance and healthcare.In 2023  revenue fell slightly by 1%  mainly due to the fall in royalties on set-top boxes  given the market shift from broadcast to OTT and from a direct license sales model to a recurring sales model.During 2023  VERIMATRIX developed its activities in the broadcasting market in Brazil through a gain in market share and continued to support its customers in the shift towards OTT via its SaaS offers3.Extended Threat defence revenue (XTD)4The Extended Threat Defense business (7% of VERIMAXTRIX’s total revenue in 2023) aims to protect applications and connected objects5 before they can compromise the company.VERIMATRIX XTD is a mobile cybersecurity solution that continuously monitors extended terminals and detects suspicious activity or anomalies that could indicate a potential attack. VERIMATRIX XTD assists security and information system teams by monitoring and controlling data access  identifying data exfiltration attempts  and providing obfuscation  encryption  and other safeguards.VERIMATRIX’s XTD solutions are aimed at new market segments such as fintech  healthtech and automotive.Last September  VERIMATRIX announced that it had been selected by GTPL Hathway Limited  India’s leading mobile service and internet service provider  to strengthen the defence of its mobile applications and websites.During 2023  VERIMATRIX signed several major contracts in the fintech and automotive sectors.It was also recognised in independent ratings as a major player and a leader in the provision of solutions for the protection of applications and connected objects: VERIMATRIX XTD received the Gold TITAN Business Award for cybersecurity in the mobile application ecosystem and won a Top Infosec Innovator 2023 award. VERIMATRIX was named a leader in the Quadrant Knowledge Solutions 2023 SPARK Matrix™ report for In App protection.In 2023  revenue jumped 43%  mainly thanks to subscription and SaaS sales.- Revenue by regionRevenue in Latin America (35% of VERIMATRIX’s total revenue in 2023) increased by 9% thanks to the capture of new customers in Brazil and good sales of perpetual licenses to existing customers.Revenue in the United States and Canada (15% of VERIMATRIX’s total revenue in 2023) was up 13%  mainly relating to subscription offers.Revenue in Asia (14% of VERIMATRIX’s total revenue in 2023) rose by a sharp 29%  mainly driven by new contracts in India.Revenue in the EMEA region (37% of VERIMATRIX’s total revenue in 2023) fell by 15%  bearing in mind that licence sales in the region in 2022 were particularly robust  creating a high comparison base for 2023.2023 financial results  an improvement in EBITDA(US$ million) 2023 2022 Var.

This difference is solely due to an increase in the amortisation expense on developments in subscription offers in 2021 and 2022. Excluding depreciation and amortisation  gross margin improved in percentage and value terms between 2023 and 2022.Operating expenses were kept under control  rising by only 1%  in line with the increase in revenue and representing 77.1% thereof.VERIMATRIX continued to adapt the cost structure to allocate more resources to its sales and marketing functions.EBITDA was up 18% to $1.3 million over the year  after $0.4 million for the first half of the yearReconciliation of adjusted operating income with IFRS operating income and net income(US$ million) 2023 2022 Adjusted operating income (4.1) (3.5) Amortization and depreciation of assets acquired through business combinations (Items without cash impact) (2.3) (5.1) Acquisition related expenses - - Non recurring costs related to restructurations (1.2) (2.6) Share based payments (0.7) (0.4) Operating income (8.3) (11.5) Finance income/(loss)  net (3.9) (4.1) Income tax expenses (2.1) (1.9) Net income/(loss) from continuing operations (14.3) (17.6)Financial position and cash flowNet debt  excluding lease commitments under IFRS 16  amounted to $9.9 million at 31 December 2023  compared with $3.8 million at 31 December 2022The debt includes private debt at a fair value of $24.4 million and the newly contracted business recovery loan (PPR) for a total amount of $8.1 million.

Recurring revenue now stands at 50% of total revenue and is set to continue growing in 2024. ARR from subscriptions is expected to grow by more than 20%.VERIMATRIX has also begun to diversify its solutions through the Threat Defense activity  with a strategy to expand the customer base (fintech  automotive). In early 2024  VERIMATRIX announced that it had already been selected to protect and defend the FirstPay mobile application of microfinance bank HBL.Already in 2023  VERIMATRIX received recognition for its technological innovation  with nearly half of its workforce focused on research and development. In February 2024  VERIMATRIX Streamkeeper won Gold in the 2024 Merit Awards in the ""Telecom Innovation"" category.VERIMATRIX expects to see a stabilisation of the Anti-Piracy activity during 2024 given the two trends under way: the continued decline in the broadcasting market  partially offset by growth in OTT  and the transformation of the sales model to one of recurring revenues. It expects the Extended Threat Defense business (XTD) to see another year of strong growth  particularly in new market segments. The company aims to continuously improve EBITDA through growth in recurring revenue in its two business activities  and a primarily fixed expense structure.Next event: 19 March 2024: Counterspy Webinar: Hacking in live sports https://www.verimatrix.com/fr/webinaires-evenements/counterspy-webinar/ Publication of Q1 2024 revenue: 17 April 2024 after marketAbout VerimatrixVerimatrix (Euronext Paris: VMX) helps power the modern connected world with security made for people.

The financial statements will be completed and approved by the Board of Directors on April 16th 2024.Supplementary non-IFRS financial informationVerimatrix uses performance indicators that are not strictly accounting measures in accordance with IFRS. They are defined in Appendix 1 of this press release. They should be considered as additional information  which cannot replace any other strictly accounting-based operating or financial performance measure  as presented in the consolidated financial statements  including the income statement set out in Appendix 1 hereof.Forward-looking statementsThis press release contains certain forward-looking statements concerning Verimatrix. Although Verimatrix believes its expectations to be based on reasonable assumptions  they do not constitute guarantees of future performance. Accordingly  the Company’s actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements owing to a number of risks and uncertainties.Appendix 1 - Supplementary non-IFRS financial information - Reconciliation of IFRS results with adjusted resultsThe performance indicators presented in this press release that are not strictly accounting measures are defined below. These indicators are not defined under IFRS  and do not constitute accounting elements used to measure the company’s financial performance. They should be considered as additional information  which cannot replace any other strictly accounting-based operating or financial performance measure  as presented in the company’s consolidated financial statements and their related notes. The company uses these indicators because it believes they are useful measures of its recurring operating performance and its operating cash flows. Although they are widely used by companies operating in the same industry around the world  these indicators are not necessarily directly comparable to those of other companies  which may have defined or calculated their indicators differently than the company  even though they use similar terms.Adjusted gross profit is defined as gross profit before (i) the amortization of intangible assets related to business combinations  (ii) any potential goodwill impairment  (iii) share-based payment expense and (iv) non-recurring costs associated with restructuring and business combinations and divestiture undertaken by the company.Adjusted operating income/(loss) is defined as operating income/(loss) before (i) the amortization of intangible assets related to business combinations  (ii) any potential goodwill impairment  (iii) share-based payment expense and (iv) non-recurring costs associated with restructuring and business combinations and divestiture undertaken by the company.EBITDA is defined as adjusted operating income before depreciation  amortization and impairment expenses not related to business combinations.Annual Recurring Revenue  or ARR  corresponds annualized value of all recurring revenues from current contracts at the time of measurement. ARR includes all contract types that are recurring in nature  such as maintenance & support  SaaS and non-SaaS subscriptions  and for which revenue is currently being recognized. The ARR is a rolling number that accumulates over time whereas the Total Contract Value (or TCV) metric also used by the Company  is typically used to measure (new or incremental) sales bookings within a period. The Company computes an ARR for SaaS and non-SaaS subscriptions and another combining subscriptions and maintenance.Net debt reconciliation(in US$ million) December 31  2023 December 31  2022 Cash and cash equivalents 22.6 30.0 Private loan due 2026 (24.4) (26.0) Other loans (8.1) (7.9) Net cash/(debt) (9.9) (3.8) Financial lease commitments under IFRS16 (8.0) (9.7) Net cash/(debt) including IFRS 16 (17.9) (13.5)Appendix 2 – Consolidated financial statements (IFRS)Consolidated income statementAs at December 31  (in US$ million) 2023 2022 Revenue 61.6 61.0 Cost of sales (19.1) (19.2) Gross profit 42.5 41.8 Research and development expenses (19.5) (20.9) Selling and marketing expenses (17.4) (17.3) General and administrative expenses (12.9) (13.0) Other gains / (losses)  net (1.1) (2.3) Operating profit (loss) (8.3) (11.5) Cost of financial debt  net (3.9) (4.9) Other financial income/(loss)  net -

(""TIP"" - tip.mi)  an independent and diversified industrial group  listed on the Euronext Star Milan segment of Borsa Italiana S.p.A.  meeting today 14 March 2024  approved the proposed annual financial report for the financial year 2023 to be submitted to the shareholders' meeting called for 29 April 2024 and 30 April 2024  in first and second call respectively. RESULTS AT DECEMBER 31  2023 The TIP group closes 2023 with a pro forma consolidated profit of 149.1 million  up compared to approximately 139 million in 2022. Consolidated net equity as of 31 December 2023 is approximately 1.44 billion  up sharply compared to 1 .17 billion as of December 31  2022  after dividend distributions of 21.7 million and further purchases of treasury shares of 20.4 million. The overall capital gains implicit in the values of TIP's assets  calculated according to our metrics (Net Intrinsic Value ""V.I.N."")* compared to their cost  reached approximately 2 billion. The capital gains realized in 2023  totaling approximately 115 million  relate to some sales including those relating to a share of approximately 5% of the shares of Gruppo IPG Holding S.p.A. (major shareholder of Interpump Group S.p.A.)  to a share of approximately one third of the stake in Azimut/Benetti  to a partial disinvestment of shares in Prysmian and other smaller ones. During the year  TIP invested 144 million in equity and carried out disinvestments for approximately 190 million. Very relevant  also as an indicator of their positive performance  was the profit share of the associated companies  which in 2023 amounted to approximately 83.1 million  considerably higher V.I.N. - Net Intrinsic Value - internal calculation of the aggregate valuation of the shares held in investees based on the business plans developed by us 1than the approximately 68.5 million in 2022  thanks to the positive results of almost all major investees classified as associated  including IPGH (Interpump)  OVS  Roche Bobois  ITH (SeSa)  Beta Utensili  Sant'Agata (Chiorino) and Limonta. The profit shares of the associated companies also include  since May  the results of the Italian Design Brands group. The positive contribution of Alpitour  a rapidly growing group  was also very significant  which in the 2022/23 financial year (closed on 30 October) achieved an excellent result thanks to the performance of the sector  but above all thanks to the investments made and the optimization of the structure and business model created during the pandemic period. In 2023 TIP collected 28.5 million in dividends  of which 20.1 million were accounted for as a reduction in the cost of investments. Almost all of TIP's subsidiaries  strengthened by their leadership position and limited or absent debt  improved the already excellent results of 2022 in 2023 and  in many cases  achieved further records  especially in terms of margins  both in terms absolutes and percentages.

The IFRS income statement does not include the capital gains realized in the period on shares and equity investments  equal to 65 million euros  and the adjustments of investments value. Revenues from advisory activities in the period were approximately 1.5 million. Personnel costs are growing slightly and  as always  significantly influenced by the variable remuneration component of executive directors which  as is known  are linked to results. In addition to capital gains  financial income also includes dividends of 8.4 million  interest income of 1.5 million and other income of 0.9 million. Financial charges mainly refer to interest accrued on the bond for approximately 8.1 million  other interest on loans for 5.3 million  capital losses on bonds for 2.4 million and other negative changes in value on financial instruments for a total 3.4 million. The consolidated net financial position of the TIP Group as of 31 December 2023  without considering financial assets considered from a management perspective to be liquidity usable in the short term  was negative by approximately 408.9 million  compared to approximately 419.3 million as of 31 December 2022. In the same period  total assets  at book value  went from approximately 1.67 billion to approximately 1.92 billion. The net financial position decreased by approximately 10 million during the year as the use of liquidity to finalize investments in shareholdings  including in particular the outlay for the purchase of the shareholdings in Investindesign S.p.A. and in Apoteca Natura  the 3distribution of dividends  the purchase of own shares and management costs were more than compensated by the proceeds from disposals and dividends received. Given the trend in interest rates  to optimize the financial structure and in view of the maturities expected in 2024 and 2025  TIP is starting to evaluate significant options which may also include bond issues. INVESTMENTS AND DIVESTMENTS In 2023  investment and divestment activity continued in a year that saw a sharp slowdown  in the world and in particular in Europe  in the countervalues and in the number of finalized deals. Overall  during the year  the TIP group made direct equity investments in third-party companies for 123.9 million  purchases of own shares for 20.4 million and direct divestments (including distributions of dividends from associated companies which  not passed through the income statement   were recorded in the accounts as a reduction of the investment made) for 211.0 million. million of euro 2020 2021 2022 2023 Investments and purchases of own shares 101 2 348 4 151 8 144 3 Divestments 18 6 353 9 165 5 211 0 In January  the acquisition of approximately 30% of Simbiosi S.r.l.  the parent company of companies that develop technologies  solutions and patents that can be used in many applications aimed at saving of natural resources (air  water  materials and soil) and energy  was finalized through the subscription of a capital increase with an investment of 10 million. Subsequently TIP acquired 50.69% of Investindesign S.p.A. (""Investindesign"")  a company that currently holds 46.96% of the capital of Italian Design Brands S.p.A. (""IDB"")  which was listed on the stock exchange on 18 May 2023. TIP invested 72 million to purchase the stake in Investindesign. IDB is the operational parent company of an Italian high-quality furniture  lighting and design industrial hub active through numerous shareholdings in companies operating in these sectors with prestigious brands including AXOLight  Binova  Dandy Home  Davide Groppi  Flexalighting  Gamma Arredamenti  Gervasoni  Meridiani  Miton  Saba Turri and Very Wood. The group also includes two companies - Cenacchi International and Modar - specialized in luxury contracting for shops and showrooms of some of the most prestigious international fashion maison. The products made by IDB's subsidiaries are distributed and sold by third parties all over the world  with an export share of approximately 75%. In July TIP organized a club deal with important Italian family offices to allow them a co-investment in Investindesign for a total of 28.4 million; in this context TIP incurred a further direct disbursement of 5.7 million. The operation was carried out through Club design S.r.l.  in which TIP has a 20% share. In April TIP started a new program for the purchase of treasury shares up to a maximum of further n. 5 000 000 shares  to be carried out by 27 October 2024. Overall in 2023 the buy-back concerned n. 2 458 043 shares purchased at an average price of 8.283 euros per share. 4In June TIP sold a 3.98% stake in its stake in Azimut/Benetti  realizing a significant capital gain. The operation took place in the context of a reorganization of the shareholding structure of the Azimut|Benetti Group following which the Public Investment Fund (PIF)  Saudi Arabia's sovereign fund  entered the company  acquiring a 33% share of the capital. Through the opening of the capital to PIF  a long-term strategic partnership was launched to support the next phase of development of the Azimut|Benetti Group  with the aim of leveraging the synergies that the new investor will be able to stimulate to support growth both dimensional and technological. In July  the investment agreement in Apoteca Natura was finalized through the subscription of 25 million (to which was added 7.5 million by the Mercati family  owner of the ABOCA Group as well as reference shareholder and entrepreneurial driving force of the initiative)  of a capital increase in the Apoteca Natura holding following which TIP holds a 28.57% stake. Apoteca Natura has an international affiliation network made up of over 1 200 independent pharmacies  for a total turnover of almost 2 billion euros and holds  together with the Municipality of Florence  the ownership and management of the 22 municipal pharmacies in Florence. The objectives of the Apoteca Natura project are the development and dissemination of its business model - very innovative and very engaging for operating partners - and  over time  its listing on the stock exchange. In August  the investment in Bending Spoons was increased as part of a capital increase operation for approximately 57 million  which was accompanied by a sale of shares by some shareholders for approximately 49 million. The agreements between the partners of Eataly and Investindustrial have been operational since August. A company of the Investindustrial group has in fact purchased 52% of Eataly S.p.A. through the subscription of a capital increase of 200 million and the acquisition of shares from some shareholders. In the context of the operation  Clubitaly increased its investment in Eataly and also lowered its average book value. Clubitaly maintained representation on the Eataly Board of Directors. Following the operation  Clubitaly's stake in Eataly is 17.67%. In October the majority shareholders of Alpitour  including the club deal Asset Italia 1 S.r.l. promoted by TIP  of which TIP is the largest investor and which directly and indirectly holds approximately 59% of Alpitour on a fully diluted basis  have instructed Goldman Sachs Bank to start an exploratory process for the valorization of their shares. In November Gruppo IPG Holding S.p.A. (""IPGH"")  in order to fulfill the commitment regarding the exemption from the obligation to promote a public purchase offer on the shares of Interpump Group S.p.A. (""Interpump"")  sold  through Accelerated Bookbuilding  1 800 000 Interpump shares for a value of 75 780 000.00 euros  before charges and commissions. IPGH has committed to a lock-up for a period of 365 days on the remaining shares. To date IPGH holds 25 501 799 Interpump shares  representing 23.840% on a fully diluted basis of Interpump's capital. As part of the operation  TIP reduced its stake in IPGH from 32.18% to 26.92%. The usual active management of liquidity also continued. 5PERFORMANCE OF THE TIP STOCK TIP is a public company listed on the Euronext Star Milan segment which capitalizes approximately 1.7 billion euros. The performance of the TIP stock and the main Italian and international indices is summarized in the following graph: 12 5 10 5 Nasdaq +273.9% 8 5 +262.5% S&P 500 6 5 +174.1% Dow Jones +136.9% 4 5 IT Star +135.1% FTSE MIB 2 5 +61.0% MSCI Eur +49.7% 0 5 TIP calculations based on data collected on 8 March 2024 at 6.42 pm source Bloomberg The 2023 performance of TIP stock was 27.2%. the ten-year performance highlighted by the graph as of 8 March 2024 is very good  262.5%  higher than almost all the main national and international indices  with a total return(1) of 323.4%  which corresponds to a annual average of approximately 32.3% and a compound figure of 15.5%. Despite the significant increase in the listing price since the beginning of 2023  the TIP stock is still at a strong discount both compared to the actual values of the underlying investments and the analysts' target prices. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS TO DECEMBER 31  2023 In January 2024 StarTIP participated  pro rata  with an investment of approximately 4.7 million  in a new capital increase of Bending Spoons based on a post-money equity value valuation of approximately 2.55 billion dollars. Following the transaction  the TIP group retains its 3.3% stake in Bending Spoons. Sales of Prysmian shares continued in the first months of 2024. This does not take away from the fact that the Prysmian group remains an absolute world leader in terms of turnover  technologies  capillarity and back log  so it will certainly provide further great satisfaction to shareholders. As it has done so far and in which we were happy and honored to have been the first shareholder for years or  later  among the first shareholders. (1) Total return source Bloomberg (Divs. Reinv. in secur.) 6The purchase of treasury shares also continued. TIP - CULTURE OF SUSTAINABILITY With the approval by the Board of Directors of the update of the document ""A Culture of Sustainability""  which took place on March 14  2024  TIP has once again confirmed and analytically detailed TIP's commitment - moreover historically consolidated - on ESG issues. The updated document relating to the 2023 financial year will be published on the company's website (www.tipspa.it - section/sustainability). In 2023 TIP joined the United Nations Global Compact  refined the correlation between corporate activities and the Sustainable Development Goals of the 2030 Agenda and signed the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI). Furthermore  it recently completed the process of quantifying its ""corporate carbon footprint""  in collaboration with Climate Partners  from which it emerged that in 2023 greenhouse gas emissions were 23% lower than the previous year. Both the emissions relating to the year 2022 and those relating to 2023 were entirely offset through compensatory initiatives. In July 2023  Standard Ethics raised TIP's Corporate Standard Ethics Rating to ""EE"" from the previous ""EE-"" with a ""Positive"" Outlook  stating that TIP has aligned its industrial orientation over time with voluntary indications from the UN  OECD and the European Union also through an increasingly solid monitoring system of ESG issues in the investment process  both in the preliminary study and screening phases for investee companies and with reference to direct impacts  it has continued and expanded initiatives to enhance personnel  protect environment and community support. TIP recently received an update on its ESG Risk rating issued by Sustainalytics  receiving a ""low risk"" rating with a much higher rating than the market average. TIP's attention to ESG issues obviously also extends to its invested companies. OUTLOOK The current period is very strange. Added to the uncertainties that have been accompanying us for years there are particular  sometimes even conflicting  elements. But also various beliefs  which cannot be certainties but which help in envisaging possible scenarios. In fact  there is a world of M&A that is slowing down everywhere  there are company valuations that  apart from sporadic cases  are declining everywhere  there is the traditional private equity sector  the one characterized by funds  which in 2023 has more than halved the exits and which saw a decrease in fund raising  in the propensity to invest and in the availability of debt to finance buy-outs. On the 7stock market  IPOs are at their lowest ever  even in the United States. Rates seem to be finding it increasingly difficult to fall  but many bond issues are selling like hotcakes. The banks  after the enormous derisking carried out post-pandemic  are selecting loans very carefully and will certainly be more inclined to finance industrial groups for strategic operations than financially aggressive deals. In face of this There are thousands of companies that need to start repaying Covid-era loans  but working capital and capitalization levels do not always allow this. However  the prices of banks  Bitcoin  Faang  gold and everything that sounds close to artificial intelligence are exploding  while mid caps around the world are snubbed  despite often having fantastic results. Based on what has been observed so far  the political framework does not appear to have much of an impact on economic events  but there is the unknown of the US elections in November. The ongoing economic slowdown was predictable and in many respects healthy  given the growth of 2021  2022 and the beginning of 2023. China and many other Asian countries  however  continue to develop at 5% or more; India is growing by 8% and therefore the Asian drive continues. the trends in rates  M&A  valuations and private equity suggest the beginning of a period with great opportunities for TIP. TREASURY SHARES The treasury shares in portfolio at 31 December 2023 were n. 18 672 951 equal to 10.127% of the share capital. As of March 13  2024  the treasury shares in portfolio were n. 19 014 468 representing 10.313% of the capital. SEPARATE RESULTS OF TAMBURI INVESTMENT PARTNERS S.P.A. The separate financial statements of Tamburi Investment Partners S.p.A. presents a profit of 47 114 003 euros  which does not take into account income and capital gains which  not passed through the income statement  were directly transferred from the OCI reserve to retained earnings. As of December 31  2023  the net equity of TIP S.p.A. was 1 094 542 461 euros and the net financial position was negative for 434 111 219 euros. 8DIVIDEND AND OTHER RESOLUTIONS The Board of Directors has proposed  based on the amount of the profit for the 2023 financial year  the distribution of a dividend of 0.150 euros (gross of legal withholdings) per share with an ex- dividend date of 24 June 2024 and with payment on June 26  2024. The Board of Directors  in order to confirm in a rolling manner the main medium-term incentive and retention tool for the TIP top management and in general for the company's employees  has decided to propose to the Shareholders' Meeting the possibility of proceeding with the approval of a new performance share plan. The Board of Directors proceeded to verify the independence requirements of the directors pursuant to art. 2 of the corporate governance code of listed companies. A similar check was carried out by the Board of Statutory Auditors. The Board of Directors also resolved to submit to the shareholders' meeting the authorization for a plan for the purchase and sale  in one or more times  on a rotating basis  of ordinary shares of the Company up to the maximum number permitted by law ( currently represented by a number of shares not exceeding 20% of the share capital)  to be determined also based on the share capital existing at the time of each purchase and the legal and regulatory provisions in force from time to time. This resolution will replace the authorization issued to the Board of Directors by the Assembly of 27 April 2023. The Board of Directors also approved TIP's adhesion to the proposal that the Board of Directors of Asset Italia S.p.A. submitted to its shareholders in recent months and which plans to start the evolutionary process of the Asset Italia project with methods that are partially different from the original ones. In particular  the path that will be undertaken provides that  instead of the proposed integration of Asset Italia S.p.A. in TIP  the shareholders of Asset Italia  including TIP  become shareholders of individual vehicles dedicated respectively to the investment in Alpitour and Limonta or  in any case  direct or indirect shareholders of the target companies in which Asset Italia has invested  with the aim of creating tracks more effective and distinct - also from a temporal perspective - in relation to the valorization processes of the individual target companies according to the technical method that will be identified as the most appropriate and efficient to pursue those purposes. The companies Angelini Investments S.r.l.  d'Amico Società di Navigazione S.p.A. and Gruppo Ferrero S.p.A.

With continued investment in our platform  we will be able to continue to leverage it to drive and support our revenue pillars  enabling us and our partners to deliver life-changing medicines to patients. Importantly  in January 2024  we announced the appointment of Dr. Joerg Moeller as our new CEO. Joerg's experience as an outstanding leader with extensive experience across all stages of R&D and a strong advocate of AI as a driver of discovery innovation and effectiveness will be key as we progress further delivering on our patient-centric revenue generating strategy. During the period  we strengthened our leadership team with the appointment of Catherine Isted as our Chief Financial Officer and Christina Busmalis as Chief Revenue Officer  a newly created role  as we increased our commercial capabilities to maximise the opportunities derived from the Benevolent PlatformTM. To ensure that we are efficiently and properly resourced for future growth  we refocused our business following a strategic review in May 2023 that resulted in an extension of our cash runway  improvement of our capital efficiency and operational effectiveness whilst retaining the critical capabilities needed to drive value creation. Governance and Board Our Board remains committed to the principles of good corporate governance. As a Luxembourg-registered company that is traded on Euronext Amsterdam  our corporate governance framework is based on applicable Luxembourg laws  the Company's Articles of Association and its internal regulations  in particular the Rules of the Board. The Company adopted the Quoted Companies Alliance (QCA) Corporate Governance Code 2018 (the ""QCA Code"") that provides an appropriate and suitable governance framework for a group of our size and complexity. The application of the QCA Code supports the Company's long-term success whilst simultaneously managing risks and provides an underlying framework of commitment and transparent communications with stakeholders. Throughout the year and the beginning of 2024 we made good progress in strengthening our Board  ensuring we are well-positioned to drive the Company through its next phase of growth. On the Board  Jean Raby was appointed as Senior Independent Director  Dr. John Orloff as Workforce NED and we welcomed the appointment of Marcello Damiani as an Independent Non-Executive Director. Dr. Jackie Hunter retired from the Board as a Non-Executive Director having served on the Board of the Company and its predecessors since 2016. After five years as CEO and Executive Director  Joanna Shields stepped down from both roles in September 2023 and I assumed the role of Acting CEO while maintaining my Chair of the Board role and responsibilities in order to provide the Company with continuity whilst the search process was underway. In January 2024  following the appointment of Dr. Joerg Moeller as CEO and Executive Director  I reverted to my position of Independent Non-Executive Chair of the Board. The Board recognises the benefits that diversity brings and the importance of having a balance of perspectives  insights and challenge. Consequently  the Board approved its Diversity Policy in March 2023. The Board also recognises the importance of providing new Directors with a thorough induction and ensuring that Directors' skills and knowledge are refreshed and updated regularly  given the dynamic business and regulatory environment in which the Company operates. Consequently  the Board developed a comprehensive induction and annual Board training and development programme during the year. A formal and rigorous evaluation of the effectiveness of the Board  its committees  the Chair and individual Directors is now undertaken on an annual basis. The 2023 evaluation was internally facilitated and concluded that the Board and its Committees continue to be effective  all Directors continue to make valuable contributions based on experience and knowledge  demonstrate considerable commitment and time to their roles and the Non-Executive Directors provide constructive challenge. Further information on governance during the year  including ESG  can be found in the Sustainability report and the Governance report.Building a sustainable business for our employees  partners and patients At BenevolentAI we serve patients by leveraging our proprietary and validated Benevolent PlatformTM that integrates AI and science to uncover new biology  predict novel targets and develop first-in-class or best-in-class drugs for complex diseases. We are committed to upholding our values and this includes a responsible and sustainable approach to our business and enhancing our platform  advancing our pipeline  supporting our partners  investing in our people and communities and reducing our impact on the planet and governing our operations. We aim to build and empower a diverse and inclusive workforce to find innovative solutions that benefit our business our partners and the patients we serve. Our goal is to contribute positively to society by pushing the boundaries of technology and science to address significant unmet medical needs by developing new medicines for a broad range of undertreated diseases. We are proud of the progress we have made this year and remain committed to continuous innovation and excellence in science and technology. Commitment to deliver on our mission of uniting science and technology to serve patients with complex diseases With clarity on our strategic focus geared towards value creation and with our revenue pillars providing a business model that is driven by the Benevolent PlatformTM  we have an engaging vision for a successful  sustainable and long-term future for the Company as one of the leaders in AI driven drug discovery. Applying advanced AI to accelerate biopharma drug discovery is increasingly becoming accepted and validated with long-term structural trends supporting its growth and I believe we are well placed to benefit from this trend for future success. As we look forward  we are excited for the opportunity to deliver on our mission of bringing life-changing therapies to patients. Along with the rest of the Board I am looking forward to working with Dr. Joerg Moeller  our new CEO. Under Joerg's leadership  our focus will remain on continuing to invest in our platform to leverage revenue generation and commercial focus  improving our operational effectiveness  and fostering a culture of excellence and innovation. I am grateful to all our stakeholders for their support during this turnaround period for the Company and  along with the rest of the Board and the Leadership Team  remain committed to fulfilling our mission and value creation. Dr. François Nader ChairCHIEF EXECUTIVE'S STATEMENT I am excited by the opportunity to lead BenevolentAI as its new CEO and  with the opportunities ahead of us  to further capitalise on our platform  pipeline and research capabilities in order to strengthen the Company's market position with an increased commercial focus. Fostering a culture of excellence  innovation and diversity is something I am passionate about  and since joining the Company I am ever more convinced of the potential of the Benevolent PlatformTM and our AI-enabled drug discovery offerings  pipeline and the potential that we have to drive value creation. Despite 2023 being a transition period for the Company  BenevolentAI achieved a number of key milestones including a significant collaboration signed with Merck KGaA. With a clear business model and strategic focus to generate revenue and growth driven by the Benevolent PlatformTM  we are well-placed to deliver on our strategic priorities going forward. Delivering on our strategic plan Commercial and platform validation: Signing a new strategic collaboration with Merck KgaA was an important milestone for the Company and one that has significant medium-term revenue potential. This collaboration also provides continued validation both commercially and for our platform and demonstrates the breadth of our end-to-end drug discovery offerings and capabilities. Further collaborations are critical to the future success of the business  and we will look to expand on our current partnerships during the course of the year. Innovation and further platform validation: Given my background in R&D and being a strong advocate of the application of AI to drug discovery driving innovation and efficiency  of particular interest is the Company's lead asset. BEN-8744 is an oral PDE10 inhibitor for the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC) targeting patients with moderate to severe disease. BEN-8744 progressed into a Phase Ia clinical study in August 2023 and top-line data is expected in Q1 2024. The success of this asset is particularly important for the Company  as its discovery validates the ability of the Benevolent PlatformTM to identify novel targets for evaluation. By generating hypotheses at the Target Identification stage  the platform identified PDE10 as an entirely novel target for the treatment of UC  with no previously known link established between PDE10 and UC. The target was subsequently validated ex-vivo  with BenevolentAI's molecular design expertise enabling rapid lead optimisation. BEN-8744 was nominated as a candidate in September 2021  only two years after programme initiation. The BEN-8744 Phase Ia study is in healthy volunteer safety and tolerability study. This asset has a novel therapeutic approach and is a potential first-in-class peripherally restricted small molecule for the treatment of UC with the potential for meaningful differentiation from existing immunosuppressive standard-of-care treatments  through disease-modifying efficacy. In line with our strategy  it has always been the Company's intention to out-license or partner this asset with this being done at the optimal value creation inflection point. Assessing a potential new expansion opportunity: The expansion opportunity of our new customisable SaaS products and suite of Knowledge Exploration Tools substantially completed initial product development during the year. As with any potential new product launch  it is essential that a thorough and current market assessment is completed for any go-to-market plan to be successful. As such  a market assessment is underway. The results of this will be complete in early Q2 2024 and will determine how this opportunity fits into the wider commercial strategy for the Company. Outlook Our priority for 2024 is to focus on delivering cutting edge AI-driven drug discovery capabilities and revenues leveraging the Benevolent PlatformTM. Importantly  we will also strive to increase operational effectiveness and have greater commercial focus whilst prioritising successful delivery of the project plans for our existing strategic collaborations  advance our internal pipeline and generate value creation through an aggressive commercial strategy. While we are currently excited as we wait for the top line data readout of our lead asset BEN-8744 in Q1 2024  we are committed to adding at least one new collaboration  as well as out license at least one of our proprietary assets  during the course of the year. I look forward to leading the Company and working with the excellent team we have here at BenevolentAI to execute on the next stage of growth and value creation for shareholders  whilst delivering on our mission of developing life-changing medicines for patients. Dr. Joerg Moeller Chief Executive OfficerOPERATIONAL REVIEW Overview During 2023  the Company undertook a strategic review of its operations to right-size the business  focus on its drug discovery collaborations and five high potential assets from its proprietary pipeline  as well as to explore a new expansion opportunity in knowledge exploration tools  all of which are driven from and enabled through the Benevolent PlatformTM. The Company also continued to invest in further enhancement of the Benevolent Platform™ to further expand its capabilities  strengthened the leadership team and brought in Dr. Joerg Moeller as the Company's new CEO post period end. End-to-end drug discovery collaborations End-to-end collaborations utilise the Company's capabilities and the Benevolent PlatformTM to enable novel discoveries throughout the drug discovery process. The Company receives upfront payments  milestones  and royalties from collaborations. In 2023  the collaboration with AstraZeneca continued and a new strategic collaboration was signed with Merck KGaA. Merck: New strategic collaboration in identification and development of novel compounds In September  a new collaboration with Merck KGaA was signed utilising BenevolentAI's end-to-end platform capabilities to deliver novel drug candidates  initially for three targets in oncology  neurology and immunology. The Company will identify and develop innovative compounds  through Hit Identification to preclinical stage. The agreement includes payments to BenevolentAI of up to $594 million  consisting of a low double-digitmillion-dollar upfront payment on signing and then potentially discovery  development and commercial milestones. Tiered royalties will also be payable on net sales of any commercialised products. AstraZeneca: Target Identification collaboration The multi-year Target Identification collaboration with AstraZeneca has been the main revenue generator for the Company before and post listing. From the initial collaboration signed in 2019  AstraZeneca is now focusing on the chronic kidney disease indication and is progressing one of the targets within this area. The collaboration with AstraZeneca was expanded in 2022 to include target identification within heart failure and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  with progress being made towards further target selection within these indications. Each novel target selected by AstraZeneca has the potential to generate significant milestones and royalties for BenevolentAI. Clinical and preclinical pipeline In April  the Company announced top-line Phase IIa study results for its topical pan-Trk inhibitor  BEN-2293  in mild- to- moderate AD. The study successfully met its primary endpoint with BEN-2293 found to be safe and well tolerated. Secondary efficacy endpoints  to reduce itch and inflammation  were not achieved. Subsequently  in May the Company confirmed there would be no additional spend on this asset. Following a strategic review of the pipeline  in May 2023  the Company confirmed that five most advanced and high- potential clinical and preclinical assets are being progressed to their next value inflection point. All these programmes are either first-in-class or best-in-class assets providing novel therapeutic opportunities and all have been developed by leveraging BenevolentAI's platform. In August  the Company initiated a Phase Ia study for its lead asset  BEN-8744  an oral phosphodiesterase 10 (PDE10) inhibitor intended for the treatment of UC. This asset has a novel therapeutic approach and is a potential first-in-class peripherally restricted small molecule for the treatment of UC with the potential for meaningful differentiation from existing immunosuppressive standard-of-care treatments  through disease-modifying efficacy. The topline data readout from this study is expected in Q1 2024. BEN-28010 is an oral brain penetrant CHK1 inhibitor under development as a potential first-in-class CNS penetrant drug for GBM and metastatic brain tumours with the potential for meaningful differentiation in efficacy in patients resistant to chemotherapeutic standard of care agents and the potential to be used in combination therapy approaches. During the period  the Company made further progress with BEN-28010's preclinical development  having successfully completed all IND-enabling studies in line with the timelines the Company had previously flagged. In June  the Company announced the progression of BEN-34712  a preclinical candidate for the potential treatment of ALS  into IND-enabling studies. BEN-34712 is an oral  potent and selective brain penetrant RARɑβ (retinoic acid receptor alpha beta) selective agonist under development as a potential best-in-class treatment for ALS. BEN-34712 is expected to be IND-ready by Q2 2024.The Company has also prioritised two earlier-stage assets: one in Parkinson's disease and another in fibrosis (neurodegenerative and immunological diseases). Both are currently in the chemistry lead optimisation stage. The Parkinson's disease asset is a potential first-in-class CNS penetrant drug with neuroprotective activity and the fibrosis asset is a first-in-class approach to targeting an underlying mechanism of fibrotic diseases. Additionally  post the strategic review of the pipeline in the summer of 2023  the Company has in excess of ten programmes that have been paused. The Company conducts regular re-evaluation of these programmes as well as assessing potential new portfolio entries. Knowledge Exploration Tools The Knowledge Exploration Tools pillar is a potential new expansion opportunity developing customisable SaaS products that seek to enable scientists to make higher-confidence decisions and improve R&D productivity. Initial product development was substantially completed during the year alongside user testing with potential customers and partners. Current market assessment is underway and the results will be completed in early Q2 2024 which will determine if or how this opportunity fits into the Company's wider commercial strategy. The Benevolent PlatformTM The Benevolent PlatformTM delivers novel insights from public  proprietary and inferred knowledge across multiple therapeutic areas. The unique data foundations come from more than 85 data types curated and purpose-built for drug discovery. During the year  BenevolentAI continued to enhance the platform in key areas such as target identification offerings  adding new data through the single-cell analysis pipeline  updating our disease approach to use patient data derived mechanisms. We also developed a new way of predicting and explaining the rationale behind target predictions building on our expertise in large language models (LLMs); enabling better use of multimodal data as part of model predictions  and improved explainability of the evidence and rationale supporting target predictions  which is key for scientists. All of these developments continue to further enhance the Benevolent Platform™ to help identify novel targets and compounds for both our own priority pipeline and also that of our collaboration partners. Corporate and organisational developments During the year new appointments were made across the Board and the Leadership Team adding further expertise to ensure that the Company's leadership is well positioned to drive the next phase of growth. In September  Joanna Shields stepped down as CEO and Executive Director and Dr. François Nader assumed the role of Acting CEO in addition to his role as Chair of the Board. Post-period end  in January 2024  the Company welcomed the appointment of Dr. Joerg Moeller as CEO and Executive Director and Dr. François Nader reverted to his position of Independent Non-Executive Chair of the Board. Dr. Joerg Moeller  MD  PhD  brings a wealth of experience to BenevolentAI. During his career  he has led global R&D organisations  initiated several drug discovery collaborations with AI platform companies  served as EVP  Head of Global Research and Development and Member of the Global Leadership Team of LEO Pharma A/S. He also previously served at Bayer AG for over 20 years where he held various executive roles culminating in his appointment as EVP  Head of Pharmaceuticals Research and Development and Member of the Executive Committee of the Pharmaceuticals Division of Bayer. Other changes to the Board included welcoming Marcello Damiani to the Company in May as a new Independent Non- Executive Director and in June the retirement of Dr. Jackie Hunter as a Non-Executive Director. In September the Leadership Team was strengthened by two new appointments: Catherine Isted joined as our Chief Financial Officer and Christina Busmalis joined as our new Chief Revenue Officer  as we establish and execute our patient-centric revenue generation strategy across all BenevolentAI's pillars. Organisationally  following the strategic review in May  the Company's headcount was reduced by circa. 30%  to 248 employees by year end  including headcount retained for the Merck collaboration. Importantly the business preserved key skills  expertise and capabilities so as not to impact future revenue generation. This  along with other select reductions in spend  reduced the Company's cash burn by around 40%  extending the cash runway to at least mid-2025  before taking into consideration any unsigned revenue such as that from out-licensing assets  end-to-end collaborations or knowledge exploration tools.FINANCIAL REVIEW Key highlights Revenue decreased to £7.3 million (2022: £10.6 million) primarily reflecting decreased revenues from the AstraZeneca collaboration partly offset by the new Merck collaboration.Normalised research and development (""R&D"") spend  excluding share-based payments (""SBP"")  of £56.5 million(2022: £65.1 million); reported R&D spend excluding SBP of £60.3 million (2022: £65.1 million).share-based payments (""SBP"")  of £56.5 million (2022: £65.1 million); reported R&D spend excluding SBP of £60.3 million (2022: £65.1 million).

Operating cash outflow before changes to working capital of £54.6 million (2022: £67.8 million).£16.1 million R&D tax credits (2022: £12.1 million) received in the period.Post the strategic review cash burn reduced by around 40% compared to pre-restructuring forecasts with the cash runway extended to at least mid-2025. Overview Following the disappointing clinical results of BEN-2293 in atopic dermatitis  the Company undertook a strategic review reducing headcount by around 30% and cash burn by around 40% compared to pre-restructuring forecasts. This enabled the Company to extend the cash runway to mid-2025  whilst still being able to invest and drive innovation across the Benevolent PlatformTM and three revenue pillars. The latter part of the year saw success with signing a new collaboration with Merck as well as progress on the Company's proprietary pipeline and new C-suite hires. The combination of inflows from Merck and AstraZeneca as well as R&D tax credit receipts in the second half of the year left the Company with cash  cash equivalents and short-term deposits of £72.9 million at year end. With our good cash position at year end  along with positive momentum in the business over the last six months  I believe we are in a strong position to execute on the Company's strategy in 2024. Revenues At BenevolentAI  we aim to monetise the Benevolent PlatformTM through commercial collaborations and through developing our pipeline of wholly-owned assets with the aim of out-licensing and co-developing. The Company's revenues decreased by £3.3 million to £7.3 million (2022: £10.6 million)  primarily reflecting decreased revenues from the second AstraZeneca collaboration that started in January 2022  partly offset by a new collaboration with Merck. Under this new collaboration  BenevolentAI will be eligible for payments of up to $594 million  consisting of a low double-digit million dollar upfront payment on signing and then potentially discovery  development and commercial milestones. Alternative performance measures and normalised presentation The normalised presentation of the Company performance can be found in note 2.4 of the consolidated financial statements. Research and development costs Normalised research and development spend  excluding employee-relatedshare-based payments  for 2023 has decreased by 13% to £56.5 million (2022: £65.1 million). This reflects the Company's efforts to optimise its portfolio to focus on its most advanced and promising pipeline assets. Reported research and development spend  excluding employee-relatedshare-based payments  for 2023 has decreased by 7% to £60.3 million (2022: £65.1 million). The decrease is driven by pipeline optimisation  partly offset by costs necessarily entailed by the restructuring programme. General and administrative costs Normalised business operations spend  excluding employee-relatedshare-based payments  for 2023 has increased by 36% to £22.4 million (2022: £16.5 million).

Since the term of validity of the above authorisation will expire on 27 October 2023  to avoid having to call a shareholders' meeting close to said expiry date  for the reasons stated below we deem it useful to propose that you proceed with a new authorisation to purchase and Proposals for the Ordinary Shareholders' Meeting called for 23 April 2024  3 pmdispose of treasury shares under Article 2357 of the Italian Civil Code et seq. subject to revocation of the existing authorisation for the portion not carried out.

Reasons for requesting authorisation to purchase and dispose of own shares The Board of Directors requests this authority because it considers that the purchase of treasury shares could be a valuable instrument to: facilitate any agreements involving the exchange of blocks of shares;dispose of treasury shares to be used in the context of share incentive plans  both existing and future  or in the context of potential issues of bonds convertible into Company shares;also in compliance with applicable regulations  to stabilise share price movements linked to anomalies in the market and improve the liquidity of the shares; and  in any event  pursue the purposes permitted by the applicable regulatory provisions  including those covered by Regulation (EU) 596/2014  as well as  where applicable  by the market practices permitted by Consob. It is also proposed to the Shareholders' Meeting  under the conditions and within limits specified below  to authorise the Board of Directors to dispose of any shares purchased  as well as of any treasury shares already held as this facility is considered an important component of management and strategic flexibility.

The subsidiaries will receive instructions for the timely notification of any purchases of shares in Fiera Milano to ensure compliance with the aforementioned overall limit of 5% of the Company's share capital. As of this report  the paid-in share capital is equal to Euro 42 445 141.00 (forty-two million four hundred and forty-five thousand one hundred and forty-one) and comprises 71 917 829 (seventy-one million nine hundred and seventeen thousand eight hundred and twenty-nine) registered shares with no nominal value. The fee paid or received for transactions involving the purchase or sale of treasury shares will be recognised in the accounts per the applicable pro tempore regulations. Duration of authority The buyback authority is required for 18 months from the date the Shareholders' Meeting adopts the relevant resolution  while the authorisation to dispose of treasury shares  which may be purchased or already in the portfolio  is required without a time limit. Fees for the Purchase and Disposal of Shares Proposals for the Ordinary Shareholders' Meeting called for 23 April 2024  3 pmWithout prejudice to the provisions of paragraph E) below  the shares may be purchased in compliance with the conditions relating to trading set forth in Article 3 of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/1052 (hereinafter  the ""Regulation 1052"") implementing Regulation (EU) 596/2014 and the applicable provisions of the Italian Civil Code  and at a price that is not higher than the highest price between the price of the last independent transaction and the price of the highest current independent bid on the trading venues where the purchase is made  it being understood that the unit price shall be neither lower nor higher than 10% compared to the reference price recorded for the Fiera Milano share on the Euronext Milan Market organised and managed by Borsa Italiana S.p.A. in the session preceding each individual purchase transaction. Shares may be sold  even before the purchases have been exhausted  on one or more occasions  at a price lower than the purchase prices. this restriction on the disposal price does not apply if the shares are disposed of as part of a stock option plan.

Procedures for the purchase of treasury shares Purchases of treasury shares may be made in one or more tranches in compliance with applicable laws and regulations  including  where applicable  permitted market practices. In particular  transactions for the purchase of treasury shares must be carried out in compliance with the conditions outlined in Article 3 of Regulation 1052  or with the applicable provisions of the Italian Civil Code  and in such a way as to ensure equal treatment among Shareholders under Article 132 of the Consolidated Law on Finance  exclusively through the following methods: takeover bid; on regulated markets in compliance with the operating procedures laid down in the rules governing the organisation and management of those markets  which do not permit the direct matching of trading proposals on purchase with predetermined trading proposals on sale. Disposals may be effected  in one or more tranches  even before the purchases have been exhausted  by sale on regulated and/or non-regulated markets or off-market  by public offer  or as consideration for the purchase of participations and possibly by assignment to shareholders. F) Information on the instrumentality of the purchase for capital reduction. The purchase of treasury shares subject to this authorisation request is not instrumental to the reduction of the share capital by cancellation of the treasury shares purchased; without prejudice to the Company's right  should the Shareholders' Meeting in the future should approve a reduction of the share capital  to implement it also by cancelling the treasury shares held in the portfolio.

These met our expectations and enabled us to achieve another year of increased sales and profitability. The performance of The Bradery  in its first full year within the Group  is a clear success. The positive contribution of our growth levers such as the Marketplace  International  and Retail Media demonstrates the excellence of the Group's assets.During the past fiscal year  we laid the necessary groundwork for the deployment of our ACE roadmap  already yielding initial results in terms of Gross Merchandise Value with the crossing of the one billion euros mark  as well as operational efficiency as evidenced by the streamlining of our logistics network  and financial profitability. We will accelerate  expand  and deepen the initial initiatives taken as part of the ACE roadmap to unleash our full potential for profitable growth. To succeed in deploying this strategy  we will replace technology at the forefront of our model and provide our teams with innovations that will revolutionize e-commerce. Specifically  in the field of Artificial Intelligence  we will undertake internal developments while partnering with cutting-edge startups. Beyond continuing profitable growth  2024 will therefore be a pivotal year  requiring substantial investments  but ultimately enhancing the Group's potential for value creation.""SHOWROOMPRIVÉ REACHES ONE BILLION EUROS IN GROSS MERCHANDISE VOLUME DESPITE CHALLENGES IN THE APPAREL SECTORRevenue 2023(in millions of €) 2022 2023 Change % Internet Revenues France 532.3 536.2 +0.7% International 117.5 129.0 +9.8% Total Internet Revenues 649.8 665.2 +2.4% Other revenues 7.5 12.0 +58.7% Net Revenues 657.4 677.2 +3.0%Showroomprivé achieved for the first time in 2023  a Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) of one billion euros  representing a 6.3% increase compared to the previous fiscal year. This growth reflects the ramp up of the business units whose performance is primarily reflected in Gross Merchandise Volume  such as the Marketplace or the Travel and Leisure segment. Revenue amounted to €677.7 million  up by +3.0% compared to 2022  despite economic deterioration in the latter part of the year affecting second-half activity (-3.0% vs. H2 22)  particularly in the third quarter. This trend was partially offset by The Bradery's excellent performance  which achieved a 76% growth year-on-year. This solid performance was achieved in a challenging environment characterized by sustained high levels of inflation  which weighed on household consumption that is still under pressure and led to difficulties for many apparel brands.To counterbalance the effects of the economic climate on its core business  Showroomprivé has relied on the dynamism of its growth drivers:The Bradery  consolidated for the first time for a full year compared to seven months in 2022  showed strong growth  materializing its potential with millennials  and benefiting from accelerated dynamics through commercial synergies with Showroomprivé. The site achieved a significant sales increase of +76% and strengthened its portfolio with highly sought-after brands.The Marketplace continues to ramp up with an increase of +85% in Gross Merchandise Volume compared to last year. This momentum is fueled by streamlining the partner portfolio to enhance delivery quality  as well as the addition of 52 new suppliers this year.SRP Services  despite a challenging environment  achieved nearly +15% growth. The relevance and diversity of the offerings provided allowed it to outperform a market slowed by advertisers' cautiousness.The Travel and Leisure segment also performed well during the fiscal year  increasing by +12%. However  the offerings were initially penalized by overly ambitious pricing from tour operators at the beginning of the year  but they rebounded once adjustments were made.The International segment progressed by nearly +10%  generating a positive EBITDA  with all European markets showing strong growth  particularly in the prioritized investment zones.In its traditional flash sales market  Showroomprivé  after a promising first quarter in 2023  experienced a slowdown in activity as the environment deteriorated. Some segments outperformed  such as the Sports & Lifestyle segment (+66%)  benefiting from regular sales with renowned brands. Conversely  the lack of attractiveness of the offer in the Home & Decor segment impacted activity  resulting in a decrease of -26% in a market context that itself declined by -0.5%. The Fashion segment performs better than the apparel e-commerce market in France  which declined by -5%[4]  with a stable performance compared to 2022. Difficulties faced by brands have created opportunities with available stocks but will require the winning of new brand partners in 2024 to compensate for the disappearance of the most fragile brands. Finally  Beauté privée  impacted by Google referencing issues  has not yet regained a satisfactory momentum  with a decrease in revenue of approximately -6%.The non-strategic revenue of other activities (physical wholesale of unsold or returned Internet items) positively contributed to growth with an additional €3.5 million in revenue compared to the previous fiscal year  which stood at €10.4 million  in line with Group sales.The sales mix between our distribution channels (conditional sales  firm sales  and dropshipping) saw a slight decrease in conditional sales in favor of firm sales in a market favorable to seizing opportunities.In 2023  Showroomprivé successfully implemented several marketing initiatives. A brand awareness campaign was launched in the second half of the year  culminating in the successful launch of ShowroomBy  where renowned influencers came to promote their fashion  home  beauty  and travel selections on the platform. The Group also continued to deploy the Unlimitail solution  which combines the most advanced technologies into a comprehensive solution that gathers the entire retail media value chain across France and continental Europe.Key Performance Indicators (KPI's)Pro forma 2022 2023 Change % Cumulated buyers* (in millions) 14.7 15.7 +7.3% Buyers** (in millions ) 3.7 3.7 -0.2% Of which Loyal Buyers *** 2.6 2.7 +3.7% In % of total number of buyers 70% 73% 3 pts Number of orders (in millions) 13.7 12.9 -5.6% Revenue per buyer (IFRS) 176.9 178.9 +1.1% Average number of Orders per Buyer 3.7 3.5 -5.4% Average Basket Size 48.1 51.5 6.9%* All buyers who have made at least one purchase on the Group's platform since its launch** Member who has placed at least one order during the year*** Member who has placed at least one order during the year and at least one order in previous yearsIn 2023  for the first year  key performance indicators consolidate figures from all Group platforms including The Bradery and Beauté privée. Across the entire scope  new member acquisition was dynamic during the fiscal year  resulting in a 7.3% increase in cumulative buyers  bringing their number to nearly 16 million. While buyers were slightly less active this year  the percentage of loyal customers remains stable at the high level of 73%.In line with the premiumization strategy  the average basket size increased once again  exceeding €50  with an increase of over €3 year-on-year  reaching €51.5. The increase in the average basket size (+7%) was able to fully compensate for the decrease in the average number of orders per buyer (-5%)  thus resulting in a +1% increase in revenue per buyer. This growth in the overall average basket size benefited from the integration of The Bradery  whose average basket size significantly exceeds that of the Group and shows a strong increase of +10% but was nevertheless impacted by the integration of Beauté privée  where average basket sizes are lower than those of Showroomprivé.Finally  the Group achieved record levels of customer satisfaction during the period with a delivered NPS of 57% (+200 basis pts vs. 2022) in France.IMPROVEMENT IN PROFITABILITY AND CASH FLOW GENERATION THANKS TO THE INITIAL MEASURES OF THE ACE ROADMAPKey figures for 2023(In millions of euros) 2022 2023 Change % GMV 945.0 1 005.0 +6.3% Net Revenue 657.4 677.2 +3.0% Total Internet Revenue 649.8 665.2 +2.4% Gross Margin 244.7 258.9 +6.0% Gross Margin as a % of Revenue 37.2% 38.2% +1.0pt Operational Expenses -240.5 -250.7 4.3% As a % of Revenue 36.6% 37.0% +0.4pt EBITDA 19.5 23.6 +21.1% EBITDA Margin as a % of Revenue 3.0% 3.5% +0.5ptThe board of directors of SRP Groupe met on March 14th  2024  and finalized the consolidated accounts for the fiscal year 2023. Audit procedures on the consolidated accounts have been completed. The audit report will be issued following specific verifications as per regulatory requirements.EBITDA[5] increased by €23.6 million  with net profit rising despite non-recurring charges.As a result of the premiumization of the product mix and strict control over purchasing prices  gross margin increased by €14.1 million over the year to 38.2% as a proportion of revenue (compared to 37.2% in 2022). This favorable effect was amplified by strict control over operating expenses  with a shift in recruitment now almost exclusively focused on implementing the ACE roadmap  as well as well-controlled marketing expenses despite the significant brand awareness campaign deployed in the last quarter of the fiscal year. In parallel  savings generated by the initial logistics and transportation rationalization measures implemented as part of the ACE roadmap contributed to raising EBITDA to €23.6 million for the fiscal year  a 21% increase compared to 2022  corresponding to a 52 basis point increase in margin to reach 3.5%.After amortisations and provisions  the operating profit before non-recurring charges amounted to €8.1 million  compared to €4.2 million in the previous fiscal year. This significant improvement is a direct result of continuous optimization measures in operating expenses within the ACE roadmap  particularly focusing on streamlining the logistics network and optimizing Astrolab.(in millions of euros) 2022 2023 Change (%) Operating profit before non-recurring items 4.2 8.1 +90.7% Other operating income and expenses -2.5 -7.0 +177.4% Operating Income 1.7 1.2 -35.9% Cost of Financial debt -1.0 -1.9 +90.5% Other financial income and expenses 0.0 1.7 n.a Profit before Tax 0.7 1.0 +43.8% Profit Tax -0.4 -0.5 +34.5% Net Profit 0.3 0.5 +54.5%*In accordance with the recommendations of the AMF. the amortization of intangible assets recognized in connection with a business combination is presented within ""operating profit before non-recurring items"" as part of marketing expenses.Other operating income and expenses amounted to -€7.0 million  impacted by non-current expenses relating mainly to compensation costs for logistics warehouses as part of network rationalization and a revised valuation of the put option held by The Bradery's two co-founders on part of their remaining stake.The cost of financial debt rose slightly to -€1.9 million in a context of rising interest rates  offset by interest earned on our cash investments amounting to €1.7 million. The Group recorded a tax charge of -€0.5 million.After taking these items into account  Group net income is up 54.5% to €0.5 million in 2023.Cash items(€ million) 2022 2023 Cash flow from operating activities +18.4 +12.1 Cash flow from investing activities -16.2 -9.2 Cash flow from financing activities -18.2 -15.9 Net change in cash and cash equivalents -16.0 -12.9Cash flow from operating activities came to €12.1 million in 2023  compared with €18.4 million in 2022. This slight decline is explained by an unfavorable change in working capital due to a greater number of firm purchases made during the year in response to one-off opportunities related to the difficulties of some clothing chains.However  these cash flows enabled the Group to self-finance the net cash outflows related to the capital expenditure inherent in its business amounting to €9.2 million over the period  lower than those of 2022 which included the acquisition of The Bradery.After taking into account the continued repayment of financial debt in the amount of €13.5 million (including debt relating to IFRS 16) and the interest-related payments of €1.9 million  the cash consumption totalled €12.9 million over the year.Balance sheet(€ million)ASSETS 31/12/2022 31/12/23LIABILITIES 12/31/2022 12/31/2023 Total non-current assets 223.8 214.5 Total shareholders' equity 201.5 202.8 Total current assets 224.7 218.4 Total non-current liabilities 43.5 28.0 Of which inventories and amount outstanding 78.7 89.9 Of which financial debt 42.8 26.7 Of which cash and equivalent 83 .5 70.6 Total current liabilities 203.4 202.2 Of which financial debt 15.2 15.7 Total Assets 448.5 432.9 Total Liabilities 448.5 432.9Shareholders' equity stood at €202.8 million as at December 31  2023.The Group had gross available cash of €70.6 million at year-end. Repayment of borrowings over the period reduced gross financial debt to €42.3 million as at December 31  2023. The net cash position is therefore positive at €38.2 million  excluding IFRS 16 debt.Net financial debt includes €10.0 million in lease liabilities (IFRS 16) as at December 31  2023. Including this accounting item  net cash stands at €28.2 million.The Group can therefore rely on a solid financial position to finance ambitious and transformative investments.OUTLOOK FOR 2024: A YEAR OF TRANSFORMATION WITH THE ACCELERATION OF THE ACE ROADMAP DEPLOYMENTAlthough the level of inflation is beginning to stabilize  persistent tensions over purchasing power  evidenced by fragile indicators of household confidence  indicate that the market environment remains uncertain for the current year. Despite the need to offset sales generated by discontinued brands  and the need to revitalize the offering in key segments such as homeware  Showroomprivé aims to continue its profitable growth in 2024. To achieve this  the Group will be able to rely in particular on the continued expansion of The Bradery  the growing share of International and Marketplace in its business mix  as well as on the expected upturn in Beaute Privee sales  and in targeted segments.Following its first initiatives launched in 2023 as part of its ACE roadmap  the Group also intends to make 2024 a transformative year with the continued rationalization of the logistics network  ongoing improvement of the UX and UI and the implementation of targeted and the ongoing implementation of ROI-driven marketing levers. In addition  the Group will use the latest innovations in digital marketing and dynamic pricing.At the same time  Showroomprivé will be investing to put its technology platform back at the heart of its strategy  which will remain the foundation of all the company's transformation projects and ambitions. Keen to remain ahead of its market  the Group will deploy Generative Artificial Intelligence solutions  as well as solutions based on non-Generative AI developed in-house  to optimize its organizational efficiency and generate substantial time and cost savings.The investments required for this ambitious transformation will be made during 2024.UPCOMING NEWS1st quarter 2024 results: April 25  2024FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTSThis press release contains only summary information and is not intended to be comprehensive.This press release may contain forward-looking information and statements about the Group and its subsidiaries.

All statements other than statements of historical fact are  or may deemed to be  forward-looking statements. Words such as 'will'  'aim'  'expects'  'anticipates'  'intends'  'looks'  'believes'  'vision'  'ambition'  'target'  'goal'  'plan'  'potential'  'work towards'  'may'  'milestone'  'objectives'  'outlook'  'probably'  'project'  'risk'  'seek'  'continue'  'projected'  'estimate'  'achieve' or the negative of these terms  and other similar expressions of future performance or results and their negatives  are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements also include  but are not limited to  statements and information regarding the Group's emissions reduction targets and other climate change related matters (including actions  potential impacts and risks associated therewith). Forward-looking statements can be made in writing but also may be made verbally by directors  officers and employees of the Group (including during management presentations) in connection with this document. These forward-looking statements are based upon current expectations and assumptions regarding anticipated developments and other factors affecting the Group. They are not historical facts  nor are they guarantees of future performance or outcomes. All forward-looking statements contained in this document are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Because these forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties  a number of which may be beyond the Group's control  there are important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. Among other risks and uncertainties  the material or principal factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this document are: Unilever's global brands not meeting consumer preferences; Unilever's ability to innovate and remain competitive; Unilever's investment choices in its portfolio management; the effect of climate change on Unilever's business; Unilever's ability to find sustainable solutions to its plastic packaging; significant changes or deterioration in customer relationships; the recruitment and retention of talented employees; disruptions in Unilever's supply chain and distribution; increases or volatility in the cost of raw materials and commodities; the production of safe and high quality products; secure and reliable IT infrastructure; execution of acquisitions  divestitures and business transformation projects; economic  social and political risks and natural disasters; financial risks; failure to meet high and ethical standards; and managing regulatory  tax and legal matters. Also see ""Our Principal Risks"" on pages 70-78for additional risks and further discussion. The forward-looking statements are based on our beliefs  assumptions and expectations of our future performance  taking into account all information currently available to us. Forward-looking statements are not predictions of future events. These beliefs  assumptions  and expectations can change as a result of many possible events or factors  not all of which are known to us. If a change occurs  our business  financial condition  liquidity and results of operations may vary materially from those expressed in our forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this document. Except as required by any applicable law or regulation  the Group expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statements contained herein to reflect any change in the Group's expectations with regard thereto or any change in events  conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based. New risks and uncertainties arise over time  and it is not possible for us to predict those events or how they may affect us. In addition  we cannot assess the impact of each factor on our business or the extent to which any factor  or combination of factors  may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. This document also contains data on the Group's Scope 1  2 and 3 emissions. Some of this data is based on estimates  assumptions and uncertainties. Scope 1 and 2 emissions data relates to emissions from the Group's own activities and supplied heat  power and cooling and is generally easier for the Group to gather than Scope 3 emissions data. Scope 3 emissions relate to other organisations' emissions and is therefore subject to a range of additional uncertainties  including that: data used to model lifecycle footprints is typically industry-standard data or estimates rather than relating to individual suppliers; and lifecycle models such as the Group's cover many but not all products and markets. In addition  international standards and protocols relating to Scope 1  2  and 3 emissions calculations and categorisations also continue to evolve  as do accepted norms regarding terminology such as carbon neutral and net zero which may affect the emissions data the Group reports. As Scope 3 emissions data improves  shifting over time from generic modelled data to more specific data  the data reported in this document is likely to evolve. Throughout this report  we include non-GAAP financial measures to explain the performance of our business  including underlying sales growth  underlying volume growth  underlying price growth  not-underlying items  underlying operating profit  underlying operating margin  underlying earnings per share  underlying effective tax rate  constant underlying earnings per share  free cash flow  cash conversion  underlying return on assets  net debt and underlying return on invested capital. Such non-GAAP financial measures are defined in ""Additional financial disclosures"" and a reconciliation of these measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included within ""Additional financial disclosures.""

(Altria) (NYSE: MO) today announced that it has agreed to sell 35 million shares of Anheuser-Busch InBev SA/NV (ABI) (NYSE: BUD) (Euronext: ABI) (MEXBOL: ANB) (JSE: ANH) through a global secondary offering (offering) comprised of a public offering of ABI ordinary shares represented by American depositary shares (ADS) in the United States  a public offering of ABI ordinary shares in the United States  a concurrent private placement of ABI ordinary shares in the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom and an offering of ABI ordinary shares  including ABI ordinary shares represented by ADSs  in other countries outside the United States  at a price of $61.50 per ADS  corresponding to €56.17 per ABI ordinary share. In addition  ABI will repurchase $200 million of ordinary shares directly from Altria  concurrently with  and conditional on  completion of the offering. The aggregate amount of the offering and repurchase by ABI is approximately $2.4 billion. Altria has also granted the underwriters an option to purchase up to 5.25 million additional ABI shares owned by Altria at the price per ADS paid by the underwriters in the offering  exercisable within the next 30 days.In connection with the pricing of the offering  we announce a $2.4 billion increase to our existing $1 billion share repurchase program. Our Board of Directors (Board) has authorized the expanded program  which we expect to complete by December 31  2024. Share repurchases depend on marketplace conditions and other factors  and the program remains subject to the discretion of our Board. As part of the expanded share repurchase program  we expect to enter into an estimated $2.4 billion accelerated share repurchase (ASR) program. We expect cash savings from the elimination of future dividend payments on the repurchased shares.“These opportunistic capital allocation decisions reflect our ongoing confidence in Altria’s future and the significant value offered in our shares today ” said Billy Gifford  Altria’s Chief Executive Officer. “We have a longstanding history of returning cash to our shareholders  and today’s announcement reflects our continued desire to create long-term shareholder value.”This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy the securities described herein  nor shall there be any offer or sale of these securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer  solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state or jurisdiction.Partial Sale of Our Investment in ABIOur remaining ownership of ABI after the offering and the share repurchase by ABI will be approximately 8.1% (or approximately 7.8% assuming full exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares). We estimate that we will own approximately 159 million shares of ABI (or approximately 154 million shares of ABI assuming full exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares) following the offering and the share repurchase by ABI.In conjunction with the offering  we have agreed to a 180-day lockup with the lead underwriter for our remaining ABI shares.We expect to maintain two seats on ABI’s board of directors through ABI’s 2025 annual general meeting. Following such meeting  we expect to have one seat on ABI’s board of directors  in accordance with our rights as a holder of restricted shares.Following the offering  we expect to continue to use the equity method of accounting for our investment in ABI.Financial Flexibility and Cash Returns to ShareholdersWe expect cash savings from the elimination of future dividend payments on the repurchased shares of our common stock. These cash savings may be used for general corporate purposes including investments in our Vision  debt repayment or further cash returns to shareholders.We remain committed to our progressive dividend goal that targets mid-single digits dividend per share growth annually through 2028. Future dividend payments remain subject to the discretion of our Board.2024 Full-Year GuidanceWe expect the combined transactions will be accretive to our 2024 full-year adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS). Therefore  we raise our guidance for 2024 full-year adjusted diluted EPS to be in a range of $5.05 to $5.17  representing a growth rate of 2% to 4.5% from a base of $4.95 in 2023  to reflect our estimate for lower 2024 weighted-average shares outstanding  partially offset by lower equity earnings related to the reduced ownership of our investment in ABI. We expect 2024 adjusted diluted EPS growth to be weighted to the second half of the year. Our guidance includes the impact of two additional shipping days in 2024 and assumes limited impact from enforcement efforts in the illicit e-vapor market on combustible and e-vapor volumes.While the 2024 full-year adjusted diluted EPS guidance accounts for a range of scenarios  the external environment remains dynamic. We will continue to monitor conditions related to (i) the economy  including the cumulative impact of inflation  (ii) adult tobacco consumer dynamics  including purchasing patterns and adoption of smoke-free products  (iii) illicit e-vapor enforcement and (iv) regulatory  litigation and legislative developments.Our 2024 full-year adjusted diluted EPS guidance range includes planned investments in support of our Vision  such as (i) marketplace activities in support of our smoke-free products and (ii) continued smoke-free product research  development and regulatory preparation expenses.The 2024 full-year adjusted diluted EPS guidance range excludes estimated net income of approximately $0.2 billion (or $0.12 per share) that we expect to record in the first quarter of 2024 for the partial sale of our investment in ABI. This estimated net income is subject to certain adjustments  including any exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares  adjustments related to the conversion from international financial reporting standards to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and adjustments required under the equity method of accounting. Additionally  the guidance excludes an estimated per share gain of $1.17 related to the sale of the IQOS Tobacco Heating System commercialization rights that we expect to record in the second quarter of 2024.Our full-year adjusted diluted EPS guidance range excludes the impact of certain income and expense items that our management believes are not part of underlying operations. These items may include  for example  loss on early extinguishment of debt  restructuring charges  asset impairment charges  acquisition  disposition and integration-related items  equity investment-related special items  certain income tax items  charges associated with tobacco and health and certain other litigation items  and resolutions of certain non-participating manufacturer (NPM) adjustment disputes under the MSA (NPM Adjustment Items).Our management cannot estimate on a forward-looking basis the impact of certain income and expense items  including those items noted in the preceding paragraph  on our reported diluted EPS because these items  which could be significant  may be unusual or infrequent  are difficult to predict and may be highly variable. As a result  we do not provide a corresponding GAAP measure for  or reconciliation to  our adjusted diluted EPS guidance.Forward-Looking and Cautionary StatementsThis release contains certain forward-looking statements that are subject to various risks and uncertainties and are made pursuant to the Safe Harbor Provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

(“Pharming” or “the Company”) (Euronext Amsterdam: PHARM / Nasdaq: PHAR) presents its preliminary (unaudited) financial report for the three months and full year ended December 31  2023.Chief Executive Officer  Sijmen de Vries commented:“We are pleased to have delivered an excellent year in which we transformed Pharming into a multi-product  commercial rare disease biopharmaceutical company. We grew RUCONEST® revenues by 10% in 2023. This demonstrates the continued need for  and importance of  RUCONEST® as a trusted cornerstone of treatment in the competitive HAE market.We launched Joenja® (leniolisib) for APDS in the U.S. in April 2023  shortly after FDA approval  and saw meaningful initial uptake for what is the first and only FDA approved treatment for APDS. We have identified and confirmed over 840 APDS patients in global markets  including over 200 in the U.S. We have started family genetic testing initiatives  important since the majority of APDS patients will have family members also afflicted with the disease. In addition we have commenced studies to determine which of more than 1 100 patients in the U.S.  with inconclusive genetic testing results showing a variant of uncertain significance (VUS)  have genetic variants that cause hyperactivity in the PI3Kẟ pathway and can  therefore  be classified as APDS disease causing. This allows for an important APDS diagnosis for these patients  who could potentially be eligible for and offered treatment with Joenja®.We also made strong progress preparing for the commercialization of leniolisib in key global markets. We have been receiving requests for individual treatment on a named patient basis  in markets outside of the U.S.  and provided the first patients with leniolisib around year-end 2023. Numerous regulatory reviews are ongoing and we are preparing for commercialization in key global markets including Europe  the U.K.  Japan  Asia Pacific  Middle East  and Canada.These results reflect Pharming’s dedication to developing and delivering therapies to unserved rare disease patients. Looking to 2024  we remain focused on our goals of identifying additional APDS patients globally  continuing the momentum for Joenja® revenue in the U.S.  to obtaining regulatory approvals and bringing leniolisib to APDS patients in need of treatment in additional global markets and to further developing our rare disease pipeline and footprint. We are also seeking to significantly expand the leniolisib market opportunity and revenue growth by pursuing development of leniolisib for additional primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) beyond APDS  and have advanced plans to start a Phase 2 proof of concept clinical trial in PIDs with immune dysregulation linked to PI3Kẟ signaling.”Fourth quarter and full year 2023 highlightsCommercialized assetsRUCONEST® marketed for the treatment of acute HAE attacksRUCONEST® performed strongly in the fourth quarter of 2023  with record revenues of US$73.3 million  a 34% increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. RUCONEST® revenues for the full year 2023 were US$227.1 million  a 10% increase compared to 2022.The U.S. market contributed 97% of 2023 revenues  while the EU and Rest of World contributed 3%.The RUCONEST® revenue acceleration in the second half of 2023 can be attributed to strong performance in leading key revenue indicators in the U.S. including new physicians prescribing RUCONEST®  new patient enrollments including high frequency attack patients  and the total number of patients. We achieved over 70 RUCONEST® new patient enrollments for four quarters in a row. Total enrollments in 2023 were up 25% vs. 2022 and were a significant driver of the strong RUCONEST® revenue growth. We also increased the RUCONEST® physician prescriber base by 13% during the year  in many cases adding previously unknown HAE prescribers.Joenja® (leniolisib) marketed in the U.S. - the first and only approved disease modifying treatment for APDSJoenja® (leniolisib) received U.S. FDA approval in late March 2023 for the treatment of activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kδ) syndrome (APDS) in patients 12 years of age and older  and first commercial shipments to patients took place in April 2023. During the nine months following launch  Pharming made strong and rapid progress transitioning known patients onto commercial therapy.Revenues increased to US$7.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2023  driven by the continued increase in patients on paid therapy  and revenues were US$18.2 million for 2023.As of December 31  2023  we have 92 APDS patients enrolled in the U.S.  of which 81 patients are on paid therapy.APDS patient findingBased on available literature  Pharming estimates APDS prevalence of 1.5 patients per million. Our U.S. and global APDS patient finding efforts progressed during the year and as of December 31  2023  Pharming has identified over 840 diagnosed APDS patients of all ages in global markets  including over 200 patients in the U.S. Of the identified patients in the U.S.  approximately 75% are 12 years of age or older  the majority of whom are currently eligible for treatment with Joenja®. Over 730 patients are in the U.S.  Europe  the U.K.  Japan  Asia Pacific  Middle East  and Canada  key markets for Pharming with estimated total prevalence of ~2000 APDS patients.Pharming advanced several initiatives during 2023 to diagnose additional APDS patients  including a sponsored genetic testing program in the U.S.  partnerships with several genetic testing companies who undertake their own testing efforts and family testing programs. We have initiated a number of programs collaborating with clinicians and patients to aid in reducing the barriers and allowing the appropriate testing in families with APDS  to help identify family members of APDS patients who may also be affected by this disease. APDS is an inherited genetic disease and Pharming believes that many of the over 200 APDS patients already identified in the U.S. are likely to have family members who remain undiagnosed.APDS patient finding - Variant of Uncertain Significance (VUS) resolutionAPDS is diagnosed based on clinical symptoms  assessment of immune cell function and genetic testing. For a patient to receive a definitive APDS diagnosis  a genetic test revealing a disease-causing (pathogenic or likely pathogenic) variant in either the PIK3CD or PIK3R1 genes is required. Patients with clinical symptoms compatible with APDS frequently receive inconclusive genetic variant test results  i.e. previously unseen variants in the PIK3CD or PIK3R1 genes. It is important to determine if these Variants of Uncertain Significance (VUS) cause APDS.As of December 31  2023  Pharming has identified more than 1 100 patients in the U.S. with a number of VUSs in the PIK3CD or PIK3R1 genes and is setting up validation studies with various laboratories to confirm which of these variants should be classified as APDS. As results become available  patients with validated variants could be diagnosed with APDS and  therefore  potentially be eligible for Joenja® treatment. Completion of these studies is expected during the fourth quarter of 2024.Leniolisib highlights - regulatory  clinical and commercial strategy updatesLeniolisib for APDSPharming made continued progress in the fourth quarter of 2023 on leniolisib regulatory filings for APDS patients 12 years of age and older in key global markets. In addition  Pharming progressed ongoing clinical trials to support regulatory filings for approval in Japan and pediatric label expansion in key global markets.Pharming’s strategy is to make leniolisib commercially available for APDS patients in additional key markets in Europe  U.K.  Japan  Asia Pacific  Middle East  and Canada. Pharming intends to market leniolisib directly in most of these markets following regulatory approval.We currently have 96 patients on leniolisib therapy as part of an Expanded Access Program (compassionate use) or an ongoing clinical study. In addition  Pharming makes leniolisib available on a named patient basis to ensure that physicians can request leniolisib on behalf of individual patients living with APDS  who meet the eligibility criteria and receive local health authority authorization  in certain countries where leniolisib is not commercially available.European Economic Area (EEA)As part of the review process of the Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) for leniolisib for patients 12 years of age and older  Pharming submitted its response to the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) Committee for Human Medicinal Products (CHMP) Day 180 list of outstanding issues (LoOI) in October 2023. In November 2023  Pharming received a Day 180 Second LoOI from the CHMP. The CHMP consulted an Ad-Hoc Expert Group (AEG) at a meeting held at the end of November. Pharming is working closely with the CHMP to address the remaining outstanding issues and we are now awaiting CHMP’s opinion on the leniolisib MAA.United KingdomIn November 2023  Pharming announced its intention to file an MAA with the U.K. Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) through the International Recognition Procedure (IRP) which replaced the European Commission Decision Recognition Procedure (ECDRP) from January 1  2024. Pharming submitted an MAA for leniolisib on the basis of the US FDA approval on March 12  2024.Japan clinical trialIn May 2023  leniolisib was granted orphan drug designation (ODD) by the Ministry of Health  Labour and Welfare of Japan (MHLW) for the treatment of APDS. In August 2023  Pharming announced that the first patient was enrolled in a Phase III clinical trial in Japan evaluating leniolisib for the treatment of APDS in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older. Patient enrollment in this study is now complete.The single-arm  open-label clinical trial will evaluate the safety  tolerability  and efficacy of leniolisib in three patients  12 years of age and older  who have a confirmed APDS diagnosis. The study’s primary efficacy endpoints and secondary endpoints mirror those used to evaluate the clinical outcomes of the earlier leniolisib APDS trials.Pharming plans to file an application for the approval of leniolisib with Japan’s Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA)  following completion of the appropriate clinical trials. An approval decision would be expected in nine months based on priority review of the application due to ODD. Eligible patients enrolled in the trial will continue to receive the investigational drug for at least an additional year through an open-label extension trial.Additional marketsPharming filed regulatory submissions in Canada and Australia in the third quarter of 2023  and Israel in the second quarter. These submissions are progressing as expected and we anticipate regulatory action in 2024 for Canada  Australia  and Israel.Pediatric clinical trialsIn 2023  Pharming initiated two pediatric clinical trials  for children ages 4 to 11 and ages 1 to 6 years old  at sites in the U.S.  Japan  and the EU. The single-arm  open-label  multinational clinical trials will evaluate the safety  tolerability  and efficacy of leniolisib in 15 children  per clinical trial  who have a confirmed APDS diagnosis. The primary efficacy endpoints and secondary endpoints of the studies mirror those used to evaluate the clinical outcomes in the previous leniolisib Phase II/III APDS trials for patients aged 12 and older.Pharming is nearing completion of enrollment in the clinical trial for children ages 4 to 11 years old.In November 2023  the first patient was dosed in the clinical trial for children ages 1 to 6 years old. Enrollment in the study is continuing as planned.Leniolisib for additional indications (PI3Kδ platform) - Primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) beyond APDSAs we continue to work towards regulatory approvals of leniolisib for APDS in additional geographies and pediatric label expansion  we have also commenced work to identify and prioritize other indications where leniolisib has the potential to deliver value for patients. PI3Kδ has been identified as an important player in a variety of disease states  and leniolisib has demonstrated an attractive  long-term efficacy  safety and tolerability profile in clinical trials conducted in both healthy volunteers and APDS patients. This provides a solid basis for our plans for the investigation and investment in further leniolisib indications.In December 2023  Pharming announced the expansion of its rare disease pipeline with plans to develop leniolisib for additional primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) with greater prevalence than APDS. Pharming has engaged with and received feedback from the US FDA on its plans to develop leniolisib for PID disorders with immune dysregulation.Primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) with immune dysregulationLeniolisib  by reducing PI3Kδ activity  could help rebalance immune dysregulation in PIDs  positively impacting clinical manifestations including lymphoproliferation and autoimmunity. Pharming is now in the final stages of preparation for the start of an initial Phase 2  proof of concept  clinical trial in targeted PID genetic disorders with immune dysregulation linked to PI3Kẟ signaling in lymphocytes  with similar clinical phenotypes and unmet medical need to APDS. These PID disorders include ALPS-FAS  CTLA4 haploinsufficiency and PTEN deficiency. The epidemiology of these targeted PID genetic disorders suggests a prevalence of approximately five patients per million.The Phase 2 clinical trial is a single arm  open-label  dose range-finding study to be conducted in approximately 12 patients. The objectives for the trial will be to assess safety and tolerability  pharmacokinetics  pharmacodynamics  and explore clinical efficacy of leniolisib in this new PID population. The trial has been designed to inform a subsequent Phase 3 program.Organizational highlightsDuring 2023 our new Chairman  Dr. Richard Peters  was elected  succeeding Paul Sekhri  who came to the end of his maximum term (eight years). Dr. Peters is a highly respected and proven industry leader  who brings extensive medical and commercial acumen for difficult-to-treat and rare diseases  from development stage to large global biopharmaceutical companies  to Pharming. We also strengthened our Executive Committee with the appointment of a Chief Business Officer  Dr. Alexander Breidenbach  who has more than 20 years of partnering  R&D and management experience in biosciences and  in this newly created position  is tasked with the development and execution of Pharming’s growth strategy.Financial SummaryAmounts in US$m except per share data 4Q 2023 4Q 2022 2023 2022 Consolidated Statement of Income Revenue - RUCONEST® 73.3 54.6 227.1 205.6 Revenue - Joenja® 7.9 0.0 18.2 0.0 Total Revenues 81.2 54.6 245.3 205.6 Cost of sales (7.1) (6.3) (25.2) (17.6) Gross profit 74.1 48.3 220.1 188.1 Other income 0.5 (1.1) 23.3 14.5 Research and development (11.6) (10.9) (68.9) (52.5) General and administrative (24.0) (17.6) (55.9) (46.0) Marketing and sales (37.9) (29.0) (124.0) (85.8) Operating profit (loss) 1.1 (10.2) (5.4) 18.2 Fair value gain (loss) on revaluation (0.9) (1.2) (0.9) (1.2) Other finance income 1.6 (4.8) 3.7 4.5 Other finance expenses (4.5) (1.5) (9.1) (5.5) Share of net profits in associates using the equity method 0.7 (0.4) (0.3) (1.1) Profit (loss) before tax (2.0) (18.1) (12.0) 15.0 Income tax credit (expense) (0.7) 3.5 1.9 (1.3) Profit (loss) for the period (2.7) (14.6) (10.1) 13.7 Share Information Basic earnings per share (US$) (0.004) (0.022) (0.015) 0.021 Diluted earnings per share (US$) (0.004) (0.022) (0.015) 0.019Amounts in US$m December 31  2023 December 31  2022 Balance Sheet Cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash and marketable securities 215.0 208.7 Current assets 316.3 277.5 Total assets 461.4 425.8 Current liabilities 76.1 59.7 Equity 219.2 204.6Financial highlightsFourth quarter 2023Revenues in the fourth quarter of 2023 increased to US$81.2 million compared to US$54.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2022 and US$66.7 million in the third quarter of 2023. This growth was primarily due to a 34% increase in net sales for RUCONEST® compared to the same period last year  as well as an 18% increase compared to the third quarter of 2023. Additionally  Joenja® revenues in the fourth quarter were US$7.9 million  a 21% increase compared to the third quarter.Gross profit in the fourth quarter of 2023 increased by US$25.8 million compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. This growth was driven by higher revenues  although it was partially offset by increased RUCONEST® production costs and royalty payments to Novartis on Joenja® sales.Operating expenses increased by US$16.1 million in the fourth quarter compared to last year. US$8.3 million of this increase is directly related to research and development expenses for leniolisib and marketing and sales expenses for Joenja®. Pharming’s expansion efforts  driven by preparations for the launch and further commercialization of Joenja®  led to a US$7.1 million increase in payroll expenses.In the fourth quarter of 2023  an operating profit of US$1.1 million was realized  in contrast to an operating loss of US$10.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2022. This improvement was primarily driven by the rise in gross profit  partially offset by the increase in operating expenses.Full year 2023In 2023  Pharming revenues increased by 19% to US$245.3 million. However  operating profit declined to a loss of US$5.4 million  compared to a profit of US$18.2 million in 2022. Similarly  net profit decreased to loss of US$10.1 million  down from a profit of US$13.7 million in 2022.This section will further elaborate on Pharming's financial performance in 2023.Revenues and Gross ProfitThe 19% increase in revenues was a result of higher unit sales volumes  supported by a price increase below CPI  of RUCONEST® in the U.S. market (US$221.2 million in 2023 compared to US$200.1 million in 2022) and the initial sales of Joenja® (US$18.2 million in 2023) following the launch in April 2023. Revenues in Europe and the rest of the world increased by 12% to US$6.2 million in 2023.Cost of sales increased by 44% from US$17.6 million in 2022 to US$25.2 million in 2023. Cost of sales related to product sales in 2023 amounted to US$23.5 million compared to US$17.4 million in 2022. In addition to the higher unit sales volume  the rise was primarily attributed to rising production costs for RUCONEST® and royalty payments to Novartis on Joenja® sales. The remainder of cost of sales in 2023 (US$1.7 million) stem from impairment charges on inventory (2022: US$0.2 million).Gross profit increased by US$32.0 million  or 17%  to US$220.1 million for the year 2023. The main reasons for this increase were higher sales of RUCONEST® and the launch of Joenja®.Operating Profit (loss) and Other Operating CostsFor 2023  operating profit (loss) decreased by US$23.6 million to US$(5.4) million compared with US$18.2 million for the prior year. This decrease was driven by increased operating costs (US$64.5 million) and offset by increased gross profit (US$32.0 million) as mentioned above and increased other income (US$8.8 million).Of the US$64.5 million increase in operating costs  US$10.4 million is attributed to milestone payments for Joenja® following its first commercial sale in the second quarter of 2023. An additional US$25.7 million in expenses is directly related to research and development expenses for leniolisib and marketing and sales expenses for Joenja®. Pharming’s expansion efforts  driven by preparations for the launch and further commercialization of Joenja®  led to a US$24.2 million increase in payroll expenses. Finally  Pharming incurred additional impairment expenses related to our DSP facility at Pivot Park in Oss  the Netherlands  amounting to US$4.7 million in 2023 compared to US$3.9 million in 2022.In 2023  other income increased by US$8.8 million to US$23.3 million as a result of the definitive agreement to sell the Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher (PRV) to Novartis for a pre-agreed  one-time payment of US$21.3 million. Pharming was granted the PRV by the FDA in March 2023 in connection with the approval of Joenja®. The amount differs from the previously disclosed US$21.1 million in the press release of the second quarter of 2023 due to currency fluctuations throughout the year. In 2022  Pharming reduced its minority stake in BioConnection from 43.85% to 22.98%. As a result of this one-off transaction  Pharming had recognized a gain of US$12.2 million in 2022.Finance income and expensesOther finance income decreased by US$0.8 million  to US$3.7 million in 2023. This decrease was caused by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the U.S. Dollar and the Euro during 2022 and 2023  which primarily impacts our net cash position. In 2022  the U.S. Dollar strengthened against the Euro  resulting in other finance income of US$4.4 million. However  in 2023  the U.S. Dollar weakened relative to the Euro  leading to other finance expenses of US$3.0 million. This decrease in other finance income was for largely offset by increased interest income from US$0.1 million in 2022 to US$3.7 million in 2023. This was driven by general interest rate hikes as well as investments in short-term readily convertible S&P AAA-rated government treasury certificates using excess cash.Other finance expenses increased by US$3.6 million  from US$5.5 million in  2022 to US$9.1 million in 2023  mainly caused by foreign currency fluctuations as mentioned earlier.The fair value loss on revaluation (US$0.9 million) relates to fair value adjustments in the BioConnection preference share. This share is included in Pharming's balance sheet as an investment in debt instruments designated at the fair value through the statement of profit and loss (FVTPL).Income tax credit (expense)Income tax credit (expense) shifted from a US$1.3 million expense for the year ending December 31  2022  to a US$1.9 million credit for the year ending December 31  2023. This change occurred due to incurring a net loss before tax in 2023  as opposed to a net profit before tax in 2022.Profit (loss) for the yearThe total net loss in 2023 amounted to US$10.1 million  compared to a total net profit of US$13.7 million in 2022. This decrease was primarily caused by higher operating costs  due to Pharming’s growth trajectory and investments in its product pipeline. In addition  fluctuations in foreign exchange rates adversely impacted the foreign currency results in the statement of income. These increased costs were partially offset by an increase in gross profit and other income.Intangible assetsIn 2023  intangible assets decreased by US$3.8 million  from US$75.1 million in 2022 to US$71.3 million in 2023. This decrease primarily resulted from regular amortization (amounting to US$5.9 million)  partially offset by foreign currency effects (equivalent to US$2.2 million).The amortization relates to regular amortization of software and the existing re-acquired rights related to the acquisition of all North American commercialization rights from Bausch Health in 2016 and the acquisition of all European commercialization and distribution rights from Swedish Orphan International AB (“Sobi”) in 2020. In addition to the aforementioned  the amortization of the Joenja® license commenced  following the FDA approval per March 24  2023. Amortization is charged based on the economic lifetime of the intangible asset. The economic lifetime of the North American commercialization rights from Bausch Health is 20 years  where the economic lifetime of the European commercialization and distribution rights from Swedish Orphan International AB is 12 years. These estimates did not change compared to the previous year. The economic lifetime of the Joenja® license is established at 14 years.Property  plant and equipmentThe value of property  plant and equipment decreased from US$10.4 million in 2022 to US$9.7 million in 2023. This decline was primarily driven by regular depreciation (amounting to US$2.4 million)  partially offset by capital expenditures (totaling US$1.4 million)  which were mainly associated with acquiring new machinery and equipment for Pharming's production process.Right-of-use assetsThe right-of-use assets decreased from US$28.8 million in 2022 to US$23.8 million in 2023. This decline was primarily driven by regular depreciation (amounting to US$4.2 million) and an additional impairment related to the DSP facility at Pivot Park in Oss  the Netherlands (totaling US$4.7 million). Pharming remains exploring alternative utilization possibilities for this asset.The decrease in the right-to-use assets is partially offset by investments in buildings (US$1.9 million) and cars (US$1.4 million). The 2023 building investments were related to adjustments in the existing right-of-use assets to account for inflation-related higher lease payments.InvestmentsInvestments increased by US$0.7 million  reaching US$10.4 million as of December 31  2023. This growth was primarily driven by a US$1.6 million increase in the equity investment in Orchard  which is designated at fair value through the statement of other comprehensive income (FVTOCI). The rise in value was primarily triggered by the announcement that Orchard had entered into a definitive agreement with Japanese company Kyowa Kirin Co. LTD for the acquisition of Orchard at a premium over the prevailing share price. This transaction was successfully completed on January 24  2024. Additionally  the overall investments saw a US$0.3 million increase due to favorable currency exchange movements.The increase in investments was partially offset by Pharming’s share of US$0.3 million in the net loss of BioConnection  which is accounted for using the equity method. Furthermore  the investments were impacted by a fair value decrease of US$0.9 million in the preference share in BioConnection  carried at fair value through the statement of profit and loss (FVTPL).InventoriesInventories increased from US$42.3 million for the year ended December 31  2022 to US$56.8 million for the year ended December 31  2023. This was largely due to an increase in finished goods and work in progress inventory.Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securitiesCash and cash equivalents alone decreased by US$145.8 million to US$61.5 million  as of December 31  2023. This decline was primarily driven by negative cash flows from operating activities (totaling US$17.5 million) and net-purchases of marketable securities (amounting to US$149.2 million). This decrease was largely offset by the aforementioned PRV sale of US$21.3 million.In 2023  the Company invested in euro-denominated readily convertible S&P AAA-rated government treasury certificates with a maturity of six months or less from the date of acquisition. As of year-end 2023  these marketable securities amount to US$151.7 million.The combined total of cash and cash equivalents  together with restricted cash and marketable securities increased from US$208.7 million at year-end 2022 to US$215.0 million at year-end 2023. In addition to the movements mentioned earlier  this increase is partially attributable to favorable currency exchange fluctuations.EquityThe equity position increased by US$14.5 million from US$204.6 million for the year ended December 31  2022 to US$219.2 million for the year ended December 31  2023. This increase was primarily driven by transactions recognized directly in equity relating to share based compensation and exercised options (totaling US$17.4 million) as well as other comprehensive income relating to the currency translation reserve (amounting to US$5.9 million) and fair value changes on investments designated as fair value through the statement of other comprehensive income (contributing US$1.2 million). This increase was partially offset by a net loss of US$10.1 million for the year.Convertible bondThe convertible bond has increased by US$5.0 million to US$138.4 million at year-end 2023  moving from US$133.4 million as of December 31  2022. This increase was mainly driven by foreign currency effects. During 2023  a total of US$4.0 million of interest was paid on the bond.Lease liabilitiesLease liabilities decreased by US$0.2 million  moving from US$33.3 million as of December 31  2022 to US$33.1 million as of December 31  2023. This decrease was primarily driven by monthly or quarterly lease payments of US$5.1 million. However  it was partially offset by new leases (amounting to US$3.2 million)  regularly accrued interest expenses (equivalent to US$1.2 million) and foreign exchange effects (totaling US$0.8 million).Outlook/SummaryFor 2024  the Company anticipates:Total revenues between US$280 million and US$295 million (14% to 20% growth)  with quarterly fluctuations expected.Continued progress finding additional APDS patients in the U.S.  supported by family testing and VUS validation efforts  and subsequently converting patients to paid Joenja® (leniolisib) therapy.Increasing ex-U.S. revenues leniolisib - from commercial availability or through our Named Patient Program and other funded early access programs in key global markets.Completion of leniolisib clinical trials to support regulatory filings for approval in Japan and pediatric label expansion in key global markets.Progress towards regulatory approvals for leniolisib in the EEA  the U.K.  Canada  Australia  and Israel.Initiate and advance a Phase 2 clinical trial for leniolisib in PIDs with immune dysregulation linked to PI3Kδ signaling to significantly expand the long-term commercial potential of leniolisib.Continued operating cost investments to accelerate future revenue growth. Our current cash on hand and the continued cash flow from product revenues are expected to be sufficient to fund these investments. No material cash burn is expected prior to the impact of potential acquisition or in-licensing transactions.Continued focus on potential acquisitions and in-licensing of clinical stage opportunities in rare diseases. Financing  if required  would come via a combination of our strong balance sheet and access to capital markets.No further specific financial guidance for 2024 is provided.Additional informationPresentationThe conference call presentation is available on the Pharming.com website from 07:30 CET today.Conference CallThe conference call will begin at 13:30 CET/08:30 am EDT on Thursday  March 14.

It was composed of 71 companies (vs 68 as of 30 June 2023). Nine of these companies were publicly traded and represented 3% of portfolio fair value (Baltic Classifieds Group  Genius Sports Group  Guotai  Inmarsat  Innovage  Openlane – formerly KAR Global  Paycor  ThoughtWorks and Verint).The portfolio did not include WGSN  as that acquisition had not yet been finalised as of 31 December 2023.During 2023  the companies in Altamir's portfolio posted an increase of 6.4% in their average EBITDA  weighted by the residual amount invested in each company.The 20 principal investments represented 72% of the total value of the portfolio as of 31 December 2023. They were as follows  in decreasing order:THOM A leading jewellery retailer in Europe (more than 1 000 points of sale)THOM had performed very well in the 2021/22 financial year (FYE 30/09)  with sales and EBITDA up 31% and 32%  respectively  both exceeding their budgeted levels.During the 2022/23 financial year  THOM gained significant market share. The company's topline grew by 8.5%  driven by volumes  while EBITDA rose by 2%  reflecting management's decision not to increase prices in an inflationary context. Sales in the first quarter of the 2023/24 financial year (corresponding to calendar Q4 2023) were on a positive trend in all of the group's markets.Lastly  THOM has successfully repositioned the Agatha brand  both in Europe and in China.EUROPE SNACKS A European leader in private-label savoury snacksOver the 2023/24 financial year (FYE 31/01)  the sales of Europe Snacks grew by an estimated 17% compared with the year-earlier period  with the acquisition of Burt Snacks (one of the UK's principal producers of crisps and snacks  acquired in March 2023) accounted for on a proforma basis. This increase principally reflected positive momentum in France and the United Kingdom  where demand for private label products increased against an inflationary background. DSTNY One of the leading European providers of secure cloud communication solutions (UCaaS) for innovative companiesIn 2023  Dstny's revenue increased by 25% over 2022 (up 6% at constant scope). Revenue growth was mainly driven by the Software division  whose annual recurring revenue rose 16% over the previous year  and by contributions from acquired companies. EBITDA remained stable over the year  as salary increases introduced as of 1 January 2023 were gradually passed through to sales prices beginning only in Q2 2023.After entering the German market with the acquisition of Easybell at the end of 2022  Dstny pursued its international deployment strategy in 2023 with two acquisitions in Denmark (Flexfone and Mobikom)  as it aimed to reach critical mass in that country. Dstny is now a major player in the UCaaS market  with leadership positions in five European countries: France  the Netherlands  Belgium  Sweden  and Denmark.

GRAITEC International developer and distributor of BIM (Building Information Modelling) software for design  calculation  simulation  manufacturing and collaborative managementGraitec continued to grow in 2023  with sales advancing by 14% (17% with the acquisition of Spanish Autodesk solutions reseller Cad&Lan on a proforma basis). This increase reflected very good performance in the Autodesk solutions resale business  in particular in North America  as well as in the proprietary software solutions business.EBITDA rose by 21% (24% with the acquisition of Cad&Lan on a proforma basis)  reflecting very positive trends in the business and the benefits of investments in the organisation aimed at improving operational efficiency. AEB A worldwide leader in ingredients and services for the food and beverage industryAgainst a background of smaller harvests worldwide (down 7% and even 19% in the southern hemisphere)  AEB demonstrated significant resilience over the course of the year. Sales declined by 6%  but EBITDA advanced by 3%  reflecting the success of the new pricing policy  which enabled the company to recover most cost increases through higher sales prices  rationalisation of the product ranges and ongoing cost optimisation.A new CEO with more than 20 years of experience in the wine sector and a very good track record assumed his position on 1 September and will focus on finding new acquisition targets. ODIN One of the principal suppliers of outsourced IT and cloud services in the NetherlandsOdin's sales declined by 2%  but its EBITDA rose by 8% (with the acquisition of Hyperion on a proforma basis and excluding non-recurring items). Through successful new pricing and sales policies  the company regained the margin it had lost in 2022 as a result of the rapid rise in energy costs.Odin has finalised the acquisition of Hyperion  formerly a division of Exact  the principal Dutch supplier of accounting and ERP software. With this acquisition  Odin extends its software management service offering and enhances the product range it offers to clients operating in financial services. The company continues to explore several acquisition opportunities with the support of the Seven2 team.As planned  Arno Witvliet – previously Director of Worldwide Sales and Netherlands country manager for Leaseweb – has taken over as CEO from Hans Lesscher  the company's founder  who will join the Supervisory Board and focus on the group's strategy and acquisitions. CRYSTAL One of France's leaders in wealth management advisory servicesCrystal's performance has significantly exceeded Seven2's investment plan. The company posted growth of revenue and EBITDA of 17% and 18%  respectively  in 2023  owing to acquisitions and robust inflows  in particular into structured products  as financial markets declined worldwide. As of 31 December 2023  Crystal had carried out 24 significant build-ups since being acquired by Seven2  bringing its assets under management to more than €7 billion. Post 31 December 2023  Crystal carried out two strategic acquisitions that brought its total assets under management to more than €21 billion.In addition  Crystal has initiated its digital transformation  aimed at digitising the customer experience and automating company processes. Deployment of this new CRM is set to be finalised in the first half of 2024. INFOVISTA A leading global provider of network performance software solutionsInfoVista has experienced a market slowdown and a decline in sales and EBITDA over the last few months. In the first half of its 2023/24 financial year (FYE 30 June)  the situation remained difficult. To improve the situation  management launched several initiatives. It reinforced the management team  implemented a new organisation aimed at improving sales & marketing efficiency  optimised the cost structure and lightened its debt load. ODIGO Leader in Contact Center as a Service (CCaaS) solutions intended principally for large companiesSales for 2023 increased by 1% compared with 2022.More than 95% of Odigo's eligible customers base has migrated to the new  single public-cloud version of its “One Release” CCaaS solution  and migration has been finalised. At the same time  Odigo deployed a new SaaS operating model in 2022 and 2023  which generated non-recurring costs and investments. Thanks to this new model  Odigo was able to initiate significant cost savings starting in the second half of 2023  with a positive impact on the operating margin  in particular over the last few months. As a result  EBITDA grew by 14% in 2023 (over 2022).A new CEO was appointed in 2023. In addition  the Board of Directors was reorganised. Three members left the Board  and Pieter Knook was appointed Chairman. He will contribute his experience as an executive in the telecoms and software industries. OPTEVEN A leading European vehicle services and insurance solutions company  covering mechanical breakdowns  roadside assistance and maintenance  with a commercial presence in 10 countriesIn a lacklustre French used vehicles market  Opteven's gross profit and EBITDA rose by 7% and 3%  respectively  in 2023  driven only by organic growth. A new site was opened in France  and 100 new employees were hired.Since the closing of Seven2's investment in Opteven  the company's Supervisory Board has welcomed the former number 3 at Renault  whose experience and network will strengthen the Board.The management team intends to step up the pace of acquisitions and is actively evaluating several potential transactions. ENTORIA Wholesale broker specialised in supplemental insurance protection for self-employed persons and the managers and employees of SMEsSix and a half years after investment  Entoria's performance is still short of expectations. The company is nevertheless back on a growth track following implementation of a strategic transformation plan in 2021  the results of which started to materialise in 2022. To successfully carry out this plan  Seven2 overhauled the management team  and the management committee was considerably strengthened with new hires in all divisions.Entoria's revenue and EBITDA increased by 6% and 13%  respectively  in 2023 compared with 2022  demonstrating the success of the recovery plan management implemented in 2021. Premiums were reindexed and new business was up sharply  boosting Entoria's topline.Nevertheless  the company's valuation has been revised down to reflect its indebtedness. VITAPROTECH A French leader in premium electronic solutions for sensitive sites with high security needsIn 2023  the group continued to pursue its profitable growth trend. Vitaprotech posted increases in its sales and EBITDA of 10% and 14%  respectively  (vs 2022 at constant scope)  buoyed by growth in its three businesses  i.e. access control  perimeter detection and intelligent video.Vitaprotech has initiated an acquisition strategy  purchasing Harper Chalice  a British specialist in perimeter intrusion detection  and NeonInsys  a French intelligent video specialist. MENTAAL BETER Leading provider of outpatient services for mental health problems of light-to-moderate severityIn 2023  Mentaal Beter's sales advanced by 13% vs 2022  driven by an increase in the number of therapists in its network. EBITDA declined by 3%  as it was impacted by inflationary pressure on salaries and a lack of available practitioners.Over the last 12 months  Mentaal Beter has transitioned its top management  with Jan-Willem van der Windt taking over as CEO in March 2023 from Martin de Heer  a clinical psychologist by training. Mr de Heer will nevertheless remain active in Mentaal Beter; he will be in charge of innovation and treatment quality. The management team was also strengthened over the last few months. A new CFO  Wietse Zwaan  took over in June 2023 and a new HR manager in charge of recruiting and retaining therapists also came on board. EXPEREO Global internet connectivity and managed services providerExpereo's sales and EBITDA rose 4% and 2%  respectively  over the year  reflecting continued growth in monthly recurrent revenue (MRR) and stabilised investments compared with 2022. The trend in the EUR/USD exchange rate weighed down performance in 2023  however. ? ASSURED PARTNERS One of the largest independent insurance brokers in the United StatesLTM revenue to 30 September 2023 rose 14% compared with the previous 12 months  reflecting sound organic growth (6%) on the one hand  driven by good sales performance and successful cross-selling  and by the contribution of newly-acquired companies on the other.EBITDA increased by 16% (LTM 30 September 2023) despite investments in new businesses.Assured Partners continued its active bolt-on acquisition strategy  with around 470 companies acquired since Assured was created in 2011.EFFICY A European leader in CRM softwareIn 2023  Efficy's sales rose by 1%  while its EBITDA declined. Robust growth in cloud-based CRM revenue (Efficy's historical business) was offset by a decline in cloud revenue from marketing automation (Apsis's historical business)  as clients transitioned to a new cloud platform.A new CEO joined Efficy in January 2024. He has wide-ranging experience as the CEO of software companies held by private investment funds. The company is currently studying several potential acquisitions. PIB GROUP An insurance broker based in the United Kingdom with a presence in continental EuropeRevenue grew by an estimated 22% in 2023 (vs 2022)  reflecting both strong performance in the Specialist and International divisions and the impact of acquisitions  in particular in continental Europe  a market that now accounts for 28% of PIB Group's revenue  vs less than 10% when Apax acquired the company. EBITDA rose 12% over the same period  held back by investments to support growth.Since PIB Group was acquired by Apax in February 2021  it has evaluated 73 targets and acquired most of them  including 56 outside the UK.

TRADE ME One of New Zealand's leading online marketplacesThe sales and EBITDA of Trade Me declined by 3% in 2023. Trade Me was particularly resilient  despite a less-favourable economic context that depressed property  employment and marketplace activities.

The Board also recognises the importance of providing new Directors with a thorough induction and ensuring that Directors’ skills and knowledge are refreshed and updated regularly  given the dynamic business and regulatory environment in which the Company operates. Consequently  the Board developed a comprehensive induction and annual Board training and development programme during the year.A formal and rigorous evaluation of the effectiveness of the Board  its committees  the Chair and individual Directors is now undertaken on an annual basis. The 2023 evaluation was internally facilitated and concluded that the Board and its Committees continue to be effective  all Directors continue to make valuable contributions based on experience and knowledge  demonstrate considerable commitment and time to their roles and the Non-Executive Directors provide constructive challenge.Further information on governance during the year  including ESG  can be found in the Sustainability report and the Governance report.Building a sustainable business for our employees  partners and patientsAt BenevolentAI we serve patients by leveraging our proprietary and validated Benevolent PlatformTM that integrates AI and science to uncover new biology  predict novel targets and develop first-in-class or best-in-class drugs for complex diseases. We are committed to upholding our values and this includes a responsible and sustainable approach to our business and enhancing our platform  advancing our pipeline  supporting our partners  investing in our people and communities and reducing our impact on the planet and governing our operations.We aim to build and empower a diverse and inclusive workforce to find innovative solutions that benefit our business our partners and the patients we serve. Our goal is to contribute positively to society by pushing the boundaries of technology and science to address significant unmet medical needs by developing new medicines for a broad range of undertreated diseases.We are proud of the progress we have made this year and remain committed to continuous innovation and excellence in science and technology.Commitment to deliver on our mission of uniting science and technology to serve patients with complex diseasesWith clarity on our strategic focus geared towards value creation and with our revenue pillars providing a business model that is driven by the Benevolent PlatformTM  we have an engaging vision for a successful  sustainable and long-term future for the Company as one of the leaders in AI driven drug discovery. Applying advanced AI to accelerate biopharma drug discovery is increasingly becoming accepted and validated with long-term structural trends supporting its growth and I believe we are well placed to benefit from this trend for future success. As we look forward  we are excited for the opportunity to deliver on our mission of bringing life-changing therapies to patients.Along with the rest of the Board I am looking forward to working with Dr. Joerg Moeller  our new CEO. Under Joerg’s leadership  our focus will remain on continuing to invest in our platform to leverage revenue generation and commercial focus  improving our operational effectiveness  and fostering a culture of excellence and innovation.I am grateful to all our stakeholders for their support during this turnaround period for the Company and  along with the rest of the Board and the Leadership Team  remain committed to fulfilling our mission and value creation.Dr. François NaderChairCHIEF EXECUTIVE'S STATEMENTI am excited by the opportunity to lead BenevolentAI as its new CEO and  with the opportunities ahead of us  to further capitalise on our platform  pipeline and research capabilities in order to strengthen the Company’s market position with an increased commercial focus. Fostering a culture of excellence  innovation and diversity is something I am passionate about  and since joining the Company I am ever more convinced of the potential of the Benevolent PlatformTM and our AI-enabled drug discovery offerings  pipeline and the potential that we have to drive value creation.Despite 2023 being a transition period for the Company  BenevolentAI achieved a number of key milestones including a significant collaboration signed with Merck KGaA. With a clear business model and strategic focus to generate revenue and growth driven by the Benevolent PlatformTM  we are well-placed to deliver on our strategic priorities going forward.Delivering on our strategic planCommercial and platform validation:Signing a new strategic collaboration with Merck KgaA was an important milestone for the Company and one that has significant medium-term revenue potential. This collaboration also provides continued validation both commercially and for our platform and demonstrates the breadth of our end-to-end drug discovery offerings and capabilities. Further collaborations are critical to the future success of the business  and we will look to expand on our current partnerships during the course of the year.Innovation and further platform validation:Given my background in R&D and being a strong advocate of the application of AI to drug discovery driving innovation and efficiency  of particular interest is the Company’s lead asset. BEN-8744 is an oral PDE10 inhibitor for the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC) targeting patients with moderate to severe disease. BEN-8744 progressed into a Phase Ia clinical study in August 2023 and top-line data is expected in Q1 2024.The success of this asset is particularly important for the Company  as its discovery validates the ability of the Benevolent PlatformTM to identify novel targets for evaluation. By generating hypotheses at the Target Identification stage  the platform identified PDE10 as an entirely novel target for the treatment of UC  with no previously known link established between PDE10 and UC. The target was subsequently validated ex-vivo  with BenevolentAI’s molecular design expertise enabling rapid lead optimisation. BEN-8744 was nominated as a candidate in September 2021  only two years after programme initiation.The BEN-8744 Phase Ia study is in healthy volunteer safety and tolerability study. This asset has a novel therapeutic approach and is a potential first-in-class peripherally restricted small molecule for the treatment of UC with the potential for meaningful differentiation from existing immunosuppressive standard-of-care treatments  through disease-modifying efficacy. In line with our strategy  it has always been the Company’s intention to out-license or partner this asset with this being done at the optimal value creation inflection point.Assessing a potential new expansion opportunity:The expansion opportunity of our new customisable SaaS products and suite of Knowledge Exploration Tools substantially completed initial product development during the year. As with any potential new product launch  it is essential that a thorough and current market assessment is completed for any go-to-market plan to be successful. As such  a market assessment is underway. The results of this will be complete in early Q2 2024 and will determine how this opportunity fits into the wider commercial strategy for the Company.OutlookOur priority for 2024 is to focus on delivering cutting edge AI-driven drug discovery capabilities and revenues leveraging the Benevolent PlatformTM. Importantly  we will also strive to increase operational effectiveness and have greater commercial focus whilst prioritising successful delivery of the project plans for our existing strategic collaborations  advance our internal pipeline and generate value creation through an aggressive commercial strategy. While we are currently excited as we wait for the top line data readout of our lead asset BEN-8744 in Q1 2024  we are committed to adding at least one new collaboration  as well as out license at least one of our proprietary assets  during the course of the year. I look forward to leading the Company and working with the excellent team we have here at BenevolentAI to execute on the next stage of growth and value creation for shareholders  whilst delivering on our mission of developing life-changing medicines for patients.Dr. Joerg MoellerChief Executive OfficerOPERATIONAL REVIEWOverviewDuring 2023  the Company undertook a strategic review of its operations to right-size the business  focus on its drug discovery collaborations and five high potential assets from its proprietary pipeline  as well as to explore a new expansion opportunity in knowledge exploration tools  all of which are driven from and enabled through the Benevolent PlatformTM.The Company also continued to invest in further enhancement of the Benevolent Platform™ to further expand its capabilities  strengthened the leadership team and brought in Dr. Joerg Moeller as the Company’s new CEO post period end.End-to-end drug discovery collaborationsEnd-to-end collaborations utilise the Company’s capabilities and the Benevolent PlatformTM to enable novel discoveries throughout the drug discovery process. The Company receives upfront payments  milestones  and royalties from collaborations. In 2023  the collaboration with AstraZeneca continued and a new strategic collaboration was signed with Merck KGaA.Merck: New strategic collaboration in identification and development of novel compoundsIn September  a new collaboration with Merck KGaA was signed utilising BenevolentAI’s end-to-end platform capabilities to deliver novel drug candidates  initially for three targets in oncology  neurology and immunology.The Company will identify and develop innovative compounds  through Hit Identification to preclinical stage. The agreement includes payments to BenevolentAI of up to $594 million  consisting of a low double-digit million-dollar upfront payment on signing and then potentially discovery  development and commercial milestones. Tiered royalties will also be payable on net sales of any commercialised products.AstraZeneca: Target Identification collaborationThe multi-year Target Identification collaboration with AstraZeneca has been the main revenue generator for the Company before and post listing. From the initial collaboration signed in 2019  AstraZeneca is now focusing on the chronic kidney disease indication and is progressing one of the targets within this area. The collaboration with AstraZeneca was expanded in 2022 to include target identification within heart failure and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  with progress being made towards further target selection within these indications. Each novel target selected by AstraZeneca has the potential to generate significant milestones and royalties for BenevolentAI.Clinical and preclinical pipelineIn April  the Company announced top-line Phase IIa study results for its topical pan-Trk inhibitor  BEN-2293  in mild- to-moderate AD. The study successfully met its primary endpoint with BEN-2293 found to be safe and well tolerated. Secondary efficacy endpoints  to reduce itch and inflammation  were not achieved. Subsequently  in May the Company confirmed there would be no additional spend on this asset.Following a strategic review of the pipeline  in May 2023  the Company confirmed that five most advanced and high-potential clinical and preclinical assets are being progressed to their next value inflection point. All these programmes are either first-in-class or best-in-class assets providing novel therapeutic opportunities and all have been developed by leveraging BenevolentAI’s platform.In August  the Company initiated a Phase Ia study for its lead asset  BEN-8744  an oral phosphodiesterase 10 (PDE10) inhibitor intended for the treatment of UC. This asset has a novel therapeutic approach and is a potential first-in-class peripherally restricted small molecule for the treatment of UC with the potential for meaningful differentiation from existing immunosuppressive standard-of-care treatments  through disease-modifying efficacy. The topline data readout from this study is expected in Q1 2024.BEN-28010 is an oral brain penetrant CHK1 inhibitor under development as a potential first-in-class CNS penetrant drug for GBM and metastatic brain tumours with the potential for meaningful differentiation in efficacy in patients resistant to chemotherapeutic standard of care agents and the potential to be used in combination therapy approaches. During the period  the Company made further progress with BEN-28010’s preclinical development  having successfully completed all IND-enabling studies in line with the timelines the Company had previously flagged.In June  the Company announced the progression of BEN-34712  a preclinical candidate for the potential treatment of ALS  into IND-enabling studies. BEN-34712 is an oral  potent and selective brain penetrant RARɑβ (retinoic acid receptor alpha beta) selective agonist under development as a potential best-in-class treatment for ALS. BEN-34712 is expected to be IND-ready by Q2 2024.The Company has also prioritised two earlier-stage assets: one in Parkinson’s disease and another in fibrosis (neurodegenerative and immunological diseases). Both are currently in the chemistry lead optimisation stage. The Parkinson’s disease asset is a potential first-in-class CNS penetrant drug with neuroprotective activity and the fibrosis asset is a first-in-class approach to targeting an underlying mechanism of fibrotic diseases.Additionally  post the strategic review of the pipeline in the summer of 2023  the Company has in excess of ten programmes that have been paused. The Company conducts regular re-evaluation of these programmes as well as assessing potential new portfolio entries.Knowledge Exploration ToolsThe Knowledge Exploration Tools pillar is a potential new expansion opportunity developing customisable SaaS products that seek to enable scientists to make higher-confidence decisions and improve R&D productivity.Initial product development was substantially completed during the year alongside user testing with potential customers and partners. Current market assessment is underway and the results will be completed in early Q2 2024 which will determine if or how this opportunity fits into the Company’s wider commercial strategy.The Benevolent Platform™The Benevolent Platform™ delivers novel insights from public  proprietary and inferred knowledge across multiple therapeutic areas. The unique data foundations come from more than 85 data types curated and purpose-built for drug discovery. During the year  BenevolentAI continued to enhance the platform in key areas such as target identification offerings  adding new data through the single-cell analysis pipeline  updating our disease approach to use patient data derived mechanisms. We also developed a new way of predicting and explaining the rationale behind target predictions building on our expertise in large language models (LLMs); enabling better use of multimodal data as part of model predictions  and improved explainability of the evidence and rationale supporting target predictions  which is key for scientists. All of these developments continue to further enhance the Benevolent Platform™ to help identify novel targets and compounds for both our own priority pipeline and also that of our collaboration partners.Corporate and organisational developmentsDuring the year new appointments were made across the Board and the Leadership Team adding further expertise to ensure that the Company’s leadership is well positioned to drive the next phase of growth.In September  Joanna Shields stepped down as CEO and Executive Director and Dr. François Nader assumed the role of Acting CEO in addition to his role as Chair of the Board. Post-period end  in January 2024  the Company welcomed the appointment of Dr. Joerg Moeller as CEO and Executive Director and Dr. François Nader reverted to his position of Independent Non-Executive Chair of the Board. Dr. Joerg Moeller  MD  PhD  brings a wealth of experience to BenevolentAI. During his career  he has led global R&D organisations  initiated several drug discovery collaborations with AI platform companies  served as EVP  Head of Global Research and Development and Member of the Global Leadership Team of LEO Pharma A/S. He also previously served at Bayer AG for over 20 years where he held various executive roles culminating in his appointment as EVP  Head of Pharmaceuticals Research and Development and Member of the Executive Committee of the Pharmaceuticals Division of Bayer.Other changes to the Board included welcoming Marcello Damiani to the Company in May as a new Independent Non-Executive Director and in June the retirement of Dr. Jackie Hunter as a Non-Executive Director.In September the Leadership Team was strengthened by two new appointments: Catherine Isted joined as our Chief Financial Officer and Christina Busmalis joined as our new Chief Revenue Officer  as we establish and execute our patient-centric revenue generation strategy across all BenevolentAI’s pillars.Organisationally  following the strategic review in May  the Company’s headcount was reduced by circa. 30%  to 248 employees by year end  including headcount retained for the Merck collaboration. Importantly the business preserved key skills  expertise and capabilities so as not to impact future revenue generation. This  along with other select reductions in spend  reduced the Company's cash burn by around 40%  extending the cash runway to at least mid-2025  before taking into consideration any unsigned revenue such as that from out-licensing assets  end-to-end collaborations or knowledge exploration tools.FINANCIAL REVIEWKey highlightsRevenue decreased to £7.3 million (2022: £10.6 million) primarily reflecting decreased revenues from the AstraZeneca collaboration partly offset by the new Merck collaboration.Normalised research and development (“R&D”) spend  excluding share-based payments (“SBP”)  of £56.5 million (2022: £65.1 million); reported R&D spend excluding SBP of £60.3 million (2022: £65.1 million).Normalised operating loss of £72.7 million (2022: £94.6 million).Reported operating loss of £77.6 million (2022: £197.0 million).Cash  cash equivalents and short-term deposits position of £72.9 million at 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: £130.2 million)  compared with £84.3 million at 30 June 2023.Operating cash outflow before changes to working capital of £54.6 million (2022: £67.8 million).£16.1 million R&D tax credits (2022: £12.1 million) received in the period.Post the strategic review cash burn reduced by around 40% compared to pre-restructuring forecasts with the cash runway extended to at least mid-2025.OverviewFollowing the disappointing clinical results of BEN-2293 in atopic dermatitis  the Company undertook a strategic review reducing headcount by around 30% and cash burn by around 40% compared to pre-restructuring forecasts. This enabled the Company to extend the cash runway to mid-2025  whilst still being able to invest and drive innovation across the Benevolent PlatformTM and three revenue pillars. The latter part of the year saw success with signing a new collaboration with Merck as well as progress on the Company’s proprietary pipeline and new C-suite hires. The combination of inflows from Merck and AstraZeneca as well as R&D tax credit receipts in the second half of the year left the Company with cash  cash equivalents and short-term deposits of £72.9 million at year end. With our good cash position at year end  along with positive momentum in the business over the last six months  I believe we are in a strong position to execute on the Company’s strategy in 2024.RevenuesAt BenevolentAI  we aim to monetise the Benevolent PlatformTM through commercial collaborations and through developing our pipeline of wholly-owned assets with the aim of out-licensing and co-developing.The Company’s revenues decreased by £3.3 million to £7.3 million (2022: £10.6 million)  primarily reflecting decreased revenues from the second AstraZeneca collaboration that started in January 2022  partly offset by a new collaboration with Merck. Under this new collaboration  BenevolentAI will be eligible for payments of up to $594 million  consisting of a low double-digit million dollar upfront payment on signing and then potentially discovery  development and commercial milestones.Alternative performance measures and normalised presentationThe normalised presentation of the Company performance can be found in note 2.4 of the consolidated financial statements.Research and development costsNormalised research and development spend  excluding employee-related share-based payments  for 2023 has decreased by 13% to £56.5 million (2022: £65.1 million). This reflects the Company’s efforts to optimise its portfolio to focus on its most advanced and promising pipeline assets.Reported research and development spend  excluding employee-related share-based payments  for 2023 has decreased by 7% to £60.3 million (2022: £65.1 million). The decrease is driven by pipeline optimisation  partly offset by costs necessarily entailed by the restructuring programme.General and administrative costsNormalised business operations spend  excluding employee-related share-based payments  for 2023 has increased by 36% to £22.4 million (2022: £16.5 million). Removing the impact of foreign exchange gains/losses of £0.7 million loss (2022: £3.1 million gain)  the underlying spend for 2023 increased by 11% to £21.7 million (2022: £19.6 million). This reflects the additional costs from operating as a public company for a full year  compared to seven months in the previous year  offset by the cost reductions made through the restructuring programme in the second half of 2023.Reported business operations spend for 2023  excluding employee-related share-based payments  has decreased by 80% to £23.5 million (2022: £115.0 million). The decrease is predominantly driven by specific charges relating to the Business Combination in 2022 which did not reoccur in 2023  most notably the listing service expense.Share-based payments (“SBPs”)Normalised SBP spend for 2023 has decreased by 94% to £1.5 million (2022: £23.7 million). Reported SBP spend for 2023 has decreased by 95% to £1.5 million (2022: £27.6 million). In both cases  the charge is largely offset by a credit for the recognition of vested options under the legacy BEIS share incentive scheme for 2023 of £0.6 million (2022: £22.4 million normalised charge  £26.2 million total charge). This comprises a £3.6 million IFRS 2 charge (2022: £29.1 million normalised  £32.6 million total) which is more than offset by a £4.2 million credit in relation to employer-related taxes in 2023 (2022: £6.6 million credit)  as a result of the provision being remeasured to reflect the year-end share price.In 2022  the Company initiated a new LTIP for which a £2.2 million charge has been recognised in 2023 (2022: £1.3 million) and which is expected to incur an ongoing SBP charge  inclusive of employer-related taxes  of between £3 million and £6 million based upon the share price as at the end of December.Operating lossNormalised operating loss for 2023 decreased by 23% to £72.7 million (2022: £94.6 million). The reported operating loss for 2023 decreased by 61% to £77.6 million (2022: £197.0 million)  primarily due to the costs arising from the Business Combination  which did not reoccur in 2023.Finance incomeFinance income for 2023 decreased by 73% to £5.3 million (2022: £19.3 million)  predominantly driven by a reduction in the downward movement of fair value of the warrant liabilities.TaxationTaxation income for 2023 has decreased by 42% to £9.3 million (2022: £15.9 million). This is predominantly composed of tax credits arising from the UK’s small and medium-sized enterprises’ R&D tax relief regime  for which there has been a decrease in the claim between the two periods  predominantly driven by a decrease in absolute spend and a decrease in the claim uplift applied to eligible R&D expenditure.Loss per shareNormalised basic loss per share decreased by 32% to 49.7 pence for 2023 (2022: 72.6 pence)  reflecting the decrease in normalised total loss.Current assetsCurrent assets as of 31 December 2023 decreased by 40% to £91.4 million (31 December 2022: £152.1 million)  largely driven by a £57.3 million decrease in cash  cash equivalents and short-term deposits.Cash  cash equivalents and short-term depositsThe cash position  including short-term deposits  as of 31 December 2023 decreased by 44% to £72.9 million (31 December 2022: £130.2 million)  reflecting proceeds from collaborations being more than offset by ordinary course working capital expenditure.Current liabilitiesCurrent liabilities as of 31 December 2023 decreased by 2% to £25.0 million (31 December 2022: £25.6 million)  reflecting a decrease in trade payables and accruals as part of the Company’s core activities  in addition to a downward revaluation in the tax provision related to employer tax arising from share-based payments. This is largely offset by an increase in deferred income arising from the Merck collaboration.Cash flowCash expended from operating activities before taxation and non-normalised items decreased by 20% to £62.6 million for 2023 (2022: £77.8 million)  primarily driven by a 23% decrease in normalised operating losses to £72.7 million (2022: £94.6 million).Similarly  reported cash operating outflow in 2023  including non-normalised items  decreased by 26% to £57.1 million (2022: £76.9 million).DividendNo dividend has been proposed for the year ended 31 December 2023 (2022: nil).Accounting policiesThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with international accounting standards  as applicable to the EU  in conformity with the requirements of Luxembourg law. The accounting policies used in the consolidated financial information are consistent with those in the audited consolidated financial statements.Going concernThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis  which the Board of Directors considers appropriate for the reasons described in note 2.2 of the consolidated financial statements.OutlookFollowing the signing of the Merck collaboration  progress on the proprietary pipeline and new C-suite hires at the end of 2023  as well as post-period end Dr. Joerg Moeller joining as the Company’s new CEO and Executive Director  the Board are confident in the outlook for 2024 and being able to deliver on value creation for its shareholders. The Company looks to sign at least one new collaboration in 2024 as well as out-license at least one of its proprietary pipeline assets and continues to look for opportunities to reduce costs or reallocate to areas where it is believed the investment will generate the best shareholder value. The cash burn over 2024 and 2025 will benefit from the reduction in costs achieved as part of the strategic review carried out in 2023  with the cash runway excluding any unsigned revenues extending to at least mid-2025  as previously guided.Principal risks facing the businessBenevolentAI operates a Risk Management Framework  which is monitored and reviewed by the Board. There are a number of potential risks and uncertainties that could have a material impact on the Company’s financial performance and position. These include risks relating to the development of our drug portfolio and ability to out-license: the commercialisation of the Benevolent PlatformTM  such as through collaboration arrangements; the biotech funding environment; the political environment; competitive threat; supply chain disruption; legal and regulatory; IT systems and infrastructure; cyber and data security; foreign exchange; staff retention; global unrest; strategic acquisitions; and climate change.

They have been prepared on a historical cost basis  except for financial instruments measured at fair value  and all amounts have been rounded to the nearest £‘000. As set out in note 2.2 below  the consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.The accounting policies set out below have  unless otherwise stated  been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements. Judgements made by the Board of Directors in the application of these accounting policies that have significant effect on the consolidated financial statements and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next year are discussed in note 3.The Group has applied the following standards and amendments for the first time for its annual reporting period commencing 1 January 2023:IFRS 17 “Insurance Contracts”Definition of accounting estimates - amendments to IAS 8International tax reform –Pillar Two Model Rules – amendments to IAS 12Deferred tax related to assets and liabilities arising from a single transaction – amendments to IAS 12Disclosure of accounting policies – amendments to IAS 1 and IFRS Practice Statement 2The amendments listed above did not have any impact on the amounts recognised in prior periods and are not expected to significantly affect the current or future periods.Certain amendments to accounting standards have been published that are not mandatory for 31 December 2023 reporting periods and have not been early adopted by the Group:Classification of liabilities as current or non-current – amendments to IAS 1Non-current liabilities with covenants – amendments to IAS 1Lease liability in a sale and leaseback – amendments to IFRS 16Supplier finance arrangements – amendments to IAS 7 and IFRS 7Sale or contribution of assets between an investor and its associate or joint venture – amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28These amendments are not expected to have a material impact on the entity in the current or future reporting periods or on foreseeable future transactions.2.2 Going concernThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis  which the Board of Directors considers appropriate for the following reasons.The Group has prepared cash flow forecasts  that provide a cash runway  excluding any unsigned revenue to mid-2025  approximately 18 months after the end of the reporting period of these consolidated financial statements  being the period covered by Management’s going concern assessment (the “assessment period”).The Group looks to sign additional collaborations in this period and  in the event of this being successfully concluded  this would further extend the Group’s cash runway. Additionally  downside scenarios have also been considered  with corresponding cost-saving mitigating actions that allow for an extension of the Group’s cash runway.The Group’s cash  cash equivalents and short-term deposits position of £72.9 million (2022: £130.2 million) comes from issuing equity via the Business Combination completed in April 2022 and related equity PIPE investment  in addition to upfront payments and other cash inflows from the ongoing collaboration with AstraZeneca (“AZ”) and new collaboration signed with Merck during the year. The Group also benefits from cash inflows from the UK’s R&D Tax credit scheme  with the most recent receipt being in July 2023.The downside scenarios consider a range of possible risks  including exposure to macroeconomic factors  such as inflation and supply chain risk. No combination of these factors indicates that additional funding will be needed throughout the assessment period  due to various mitigating actions that the Board of Directors could implement to preserve cash and therefore extend the cash runway  if needed. These mitigating actions include signing additional revenues from signing further collaborations or outlicensing of proprietary pipeline programmes  and/or a reduction in operating expenses which are within the control of the Board of Directors.As described in the outlook in the Financial review  the Group looks to sign at least one new collaboration in 2024  as well as outlicense at least one of its proprietary products  and continues to look for opportunities to reduce costs or reallocate to areas where it is believed the investment will generate the best shareholder value. These cash flow forecasts indicate that the Group will have sufficient funds to meet its liabilities for the assessment period.Beyond mid-2025  the Group would require additional inflows to fund current operations and maximise the opportunity the Group sees within the AI-enabled drug discovery field. The Board of Directors remains confident that this is able to be achieved through inflows from signing additional revenues (as described above) and  if needed  additional funding and/or cost reduction measures.2.3 Basis of consolidationSubsidiariesSubsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to  or has rights to  variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. In assessing control  the Group takes into consideration potential voting rights that are currently exercisable. The acquisition date is the date on which control is transferred to the acquirer. The consolidated financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases. Losses applicable to the non-controlling interests in a subsidiary are allocated to the non-controlling interests even if doing so causes the non-controlling interests to have a deficit balance.Transactions eliminated on consolidationIntra-group balances and transactions  and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions  are eliminated.2.4 Normalised operating lossNormalised operating loss for the years ended 31 December 2023 and 31 December 2022 is defined as operating loss excluding non-normalised transactions  defined as those related to the restructuring programme undertaken following the strategic plan announced on 25 May 2023; those related to the Transaction; the revaluation of investments which BAI does not control directly; and the revaluation of the warrants recognised as finance income. This is to show an underlying representation of operating losses for the respective periods and extends to normalised operating cash flows on the same basis.Normalised operating losses  normalised operating cash flows and non-normalised transactions are each alternative performance measures (“APM”s) that are not calculated in accordance with IFRS and  therefore  may not be directly comparable with other companies’ APMs  including those in the Group’s industry. APMs should be considered in addition to  and are not intended to substitute or supersede  IFRS measures.This APM is in our view an important metric for a biotech company in the development stage. Removing the non-normalised costs  given their material  isolated and one-off nature  enables users to better compare the Group’s normal operating performance between reporting periods.The following table presents a reconciliation of normalised operating loss  to the closest IFRS measures  for the year ended 31 December:Note 2023 £'000 2022 £'000 Operating loss (77 573) (197 034) Adjustments for: Restructuring programme expenses 22 4 922 - Transaction-related expenditure - 11 255 Transaction-related listing service SBP expense - 83 067 Transaction-related employee-related SBP expenses - 3 883 Transaction-related stamp duty - 3 740 Revaluation of investments - 491 Total non-normalised operating charges 4 922 102 436 Normalised operating loss (72 651) (94 598)Similarly  normalised operating cash flows are considered on the same basis and to the same effect.

The 2022 comparative has been aligned with the presentation used in 2023  involving reclassifications which Management believes results in more relevant information.2.5 Foreign currencyTransactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of Group entities at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are retranslated to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are retranslated to the functional currency at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined.The assets and liabilities of foreign operations  including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation  are translated to the Group’s presentational currency  GBP  at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated at an average rate for the year where this rate approximates to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.Exchange differences arising from this translation of foreign operations are reported as an item of other comprehensive income and accumulated in the translation reserve. When a foreign operation is disposed of  such that control  or significant influence (as the case may be) is lost  the entire accumulated amount in the foreign currency translation reserve  is recycled to profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal.2.6 Classification of financial instruments issued by the CompanyFollowing the adoption of IAS 32  financial instruments issued by the Company are treated as equity only to the extent that they meet the following two conditions:(a) they include no contractual obligations upon the Company to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another party under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Company; and(b) where the instrument will or may be settled in the Company’s own equity instruments  it is either a non-derivative that includes no obligation to deliver a variable number of the Company’s own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the Company’s exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.To the extent that this definition is not met  the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability. Where the instrument so classified takes the legal form of the Company’s own shares  the amounts presented in these consolidated financial statements for called up share capital and share premium account exclude amounts in relation to those shares.2.7 Non-derivative financial instrumentsNon-derivative financial instruments comprise investments in equity  trade and other receivables  cash and cash equivalents  short-term deposits  and trade and other payables.Trade and other receivablesTrade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition  they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method  less any expected credit losses.Trade and other payablesTrade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition  they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method.Cash and cash equivalentsCash and cash equivalents include cash balances and cash deposits with maturities of less than three months at their inception.Short-term depositsShort-term deposits include cash deposits with maturities of greater than three months but less than twelve months at their inception.InvestmentsInvestments are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition  they are measured at fair value through profit or loss using latest observable share price.2.8 Derivative financial instrumentsWarrantsAs part of the Business Combination in 2022  BAI Group took on warrants which had been initially issued by Odyssey prior to the Transaction  as part of financing Odyssey’s working capital and investment.A derivative  other than a derivative that meets the definition of an equity instrument  is initially recognised as a financial asset or financial liability at its fair value on the date the derivative contract is entered into  and the related transaction costs are expensed. The fair values of the derivatives are remeasured at the end of each reporting period with changes in fair values recognised through profit or loss.A derivative that will be settled by the Company delivering a fixed number of its own equity instruments in exchange for a fixed amount of cash in terms of its functional currency or another financial asset is classified and presented as an equity instrument  rather than a financial liability. As the exercise price of the Company’s share purchase warrants that are exercisable into common shares is denominated in EUR  however  the Company will receive a variable amount of cash in terms of its GBP functional currency upon exercise of the warrants  subject to movements in foreign exchange.The warrants are  therefore  presented as derivative financial liabilities.Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are retranslated to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation of the EUR denominated warrants are recognised as finance income/expense in the statement of comprehensive income.2.9 Intangible assetsGoodwillGoodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to a single identifiable cash-generating unit and is not amortised but instead tested annually for impairment.Research and developmentExpenditure on research activities is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as an expense as incurred.Expenditure on development activities is capitalised if the product or process is technically and commercially feasible; the Group intends and has the technical ability and sufficient resources to complete development; future economic benefits are probable; and the Group can measure reliably the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development. Development activities involve a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved products or processes. The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials  direct labour and an appropriate proportion of overheads and capitalised borrowing costs. Other development expenditure is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as an expense as incurred. Capitalised development expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and less accumulated impairment losses.Other intangible assetsExpenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as an expense as incurred.Patents or rights to their future income acquired by the Group are initially recognised based on transaction price and stated at this cost less accumulated amortisation. Indicators of impairment are assessed at the end of each reporting period.Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and less accumulated impairment losses.AmortisationAmortisation is recognised as an administrative expense in the statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets  starting from the date they are available for use. The estimated useful life and amortisation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period  with the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis. The estimated useful lives are as follows:Patents or rights to their future income – over the expected duration of the patentSoftware - length of software licenceGoodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite useful life are not amortised but are systematically tested for impairment annually.2.10 Property  plant and equipmentProperty  plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.Where parts of an item of property  plant and equipment have different useful lives  they are accounted for as separate items of property  plant and equipment.Depreciation is charged to the statement of comprehensive income under either the administrative expense or R&D expense  depending on the classification of the asset  on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of tangible fixed assets. Leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their useful lives. The estimated useful lives are as follows:laboratory equipment 4–10 years computer equipment 3 years fixtures and fittings 4–5 years leasehold improvements over the term of the lease or to the first-break clause  whichever is deemed most appropriate for the facilityAssets under construction are not depreciated until the asset is available for use  at which point the asset is transferred into either fixtures and fittings or leasehold improvements  and depreciated accordingly.Depreciation methods  useful lives and residual values are reviewed if there is an indication of a significant change since the last annual reporting date in the pattern by which the Group expects to consume an asset’s future economic benefits.2.11 Lease liabilities and right-of-use assetsThe Group assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease  at inception of the contract. The Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a corresponding lease liability with respect to all lease arrangements in which it is the lessee  except for short-term leases (with terms of twelve months or less) and leases of low-value assets. Lease payments on these short-term or low-value assets are expensed to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.Lease liabilitiesThe lease liability is initially measured at the present value of lease payments over the lease term  less any already paid at the commencement date  discounted by using the rate implicit in the lease. The Group determines the lease term as the non-cancellable term of the lease  together with any periods covered by an option to extend the lease if it is reasonably certain to be exercised  or any periods covered by an option to terminate the lease  if it is reasonably certain not to be exercised. If the rate implicit in the lease cannot be readily determined  the Group uses its incremental borrowing rate.Lease payments included in the measurement of the lease liability comprise:fixed lease payments (including in substance fixed payments)  less any lease incentives receivable;the exercise price of purchase options if the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise the options; andpayments of penalties for terminating the lease if the lease term reflects the exercise of an option to terminate the lease.The lease liability is subsequently measured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability (using the effective interest method) and by reducing the carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made.The Group remeasures the lease liability  with a corresponding adjustment to the related right-of-use asset  whenever a lease contract is modified and the lease modification is not accounted for as a separate lease. In this case  the lease liability is remeasured based on the lease term of the modified lease by discounting the revised lease payments using a revised discount rate at the effective date of the modification.Right-of-use assetsRight-of-use assets are initially measured at cost  comprising the initial amount of the lease liability  adjusted for  as applicable  any lease payments made at or before the commencement date and any lease incentives received  plus initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs expected to be incurred for dismantling and removing the underlying asset  and restoring the site or asset.Right-of-use assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the unexpired period of the lease or the estimated useful life of the asset  whichever is the shorter. Where the Group expects to obtain ownership of the leased asset at the end of the lease term  the depreciation is over the estimated useful life of the underlying asset. Right-of-use assets are subject to impairment or adjusted for any remeasurement of lease liabilities.2.12 Business combinationsBusiness combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date  which is the date on which control is transferred to the Group.The Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as:the fair value of the consideration transferred; plusthe recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree; plusthe fair value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree; lessthe net recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. If the contingent consideration is classified as equity  it is not remeasured  and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise  subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration are recognised in profit or loss.2.13 ImpairmentFinancial assets (including receivables)Financial assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at the end of the reporting period. The Group recognises an allowance for expected credit losses (“ECLs"") for all debt instruments not held at fair value through profit or loss. ECLs are based on the difference between the contractual cash flows due in accordance with the contract and all the cash flows that the Group expects to receive  discounted at an approximation of the original effective interest rate.For credit exposures for which there has not been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition  ECLs are provided for credit losses that result from default events that are possible within the next twelve months. For those credit exposures for which there has been a significant increase in credit risk since initial recognition  a loss allowance is required for credit losses expected over the remaining life of the exposure  irrespective of the timing of the default.Non-financial assetsThe carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets are reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists  then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated.The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit (“CGU”) is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs of disposal (“FVLCOD”). Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. In assessing the fair value of the CGU to which the Goodwill has been allocated  Management has considered quoted market prices in an active market  as it considers the Group as a single CGU.For the purpose of impairment testing  assets that cannot be tested individually are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or groups of assets (the CGU).An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss. Impairment losses recognised in respect of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the units  and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the unit (group of units) on a pro rata basis.An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets  impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined  net of depreciation or amortisation  if no impairment loss had been recognised.2.14 Employee benefitsDefined contribution plansA defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity and will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the statement of comprehensive income in the periods during which services are rendered by employees.Share-based payment transactions – BenevolentAI Equity Incentive Scheme (“BEIS”)Share-based payment arrangements in which the Group receives goods or services as consideration for its own equity instruments are accounted for as equity-settled share-based payment transactions  regardless of how the equity instruments are obtained by the Group. At the point of exercise or settlement  awards are treated as equity-settled  including any portion withheld for tax purposes under a net settlement agreement.Options or RSUs granted under the BEIS are composed of tranches that represent each increment that participants become entitled to over the vesting period. The fair value of each of these vesting tranches is recognised as an employee or related expense in the statement of comprehensive income  on a straight-line basis over the longer of either the time until the service condition is met or the trigger event is expected to take place (“vesting period”)  with a corresponding movement to equity reserves. For each tranche continuing to have their FV charged after the trigger event  this is spread on a straight line basis over the service period. The fair value of the awards granted is measured using the Black-Scholes model. The amount to be expensed over the vesting period is adjusted to reflect the number of awards for which the related non-market vesting conditions are expected to be met  such that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based on the number of awards that meet the related non-market performance conditions at the vesting date.At each consolidated statement of financial position date  the Group revises its estimates of the number of awards that are expected to vest  as well as the estimate of the vesting period. The impact of the revisions of original estimates  if any  is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income  with a corresponding adjustment to equity reserves  over the remaining vesting period.Share-based payment transactions – Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”)Awards granted to participants under the LTIP comprise RSUs and performance stock units (“PSUs”). The fair value for the RSUs has been determined and recognised on the same basis as under the BEIS post-trigger event  namely tied to the service condition.The PSUs include both non-market vesting conditions and market vesting conditions. As with the BEIS  the number of equity instruments expected to vest which are tied to the non-market conditions is revisited at each balance sheet date so that  ultimately  the cumulative amount recognised over the vesting period is based on the number of instruments that eventually vest.Market vesting conditions  however  are factored into the fair value of the awards granted. The portion of each PSU which relates to market vesting conditions carries a separate fair value  determined using the Monte Carlo Simulation model. Provided all other vesting conditions are satisfied  a charge is made irrespective of whether the market vesting conditions are satisfied. The cumulative expense is not adjusted for failure to achieve a market vesting condition.Tax payments related to share-based paymentsThis liability is recognised in-line with the relative portion of fair value charged for each tranche as at the balance sheet date  under both the BEIS and LTIP  adjusted for changes in expectation with regards to the non-market vesting conditions and based on the latest market share price available as at that same date.2.15 Revenue recognitionRevenues to date have consisted principally of collaboration revenues  which typically consist of an initial upfront payment  periodic collaboration payments and potential milestone payments for research  development and commercial achievements plus royalties on net sales.The Group initially recognises income under the collaboration as deferred revenue.Once the contract has been identified in line with IFRS 15  each distinct performance obligation underpinning the collaboration agreement is determined  based on an assessment of whether the promises in an agreement are capable of being distinct and are distinct from the other promises to transfer goods and/or services in the context of the contract.Fixed upfront payments are allocated against the performance obligations to which that upfront payment relates  using an input model which considers the proportion of total expected research and development costs expected to be required in order to deliver each performance obligation. Revenue is then recognised over directly attributable costs incurred thus far  necessarily incurred towards producing the required output  as a proportion of total direct costs expected to be incurred. This cost-to-cost method of revenue recognition provides a measure of the progress towards satisfaction of the underlying performance obligation. Frequent meetings between collaborators to discuss progress helps ensure this measure of progress provides a faithful depiction of the transfer of services.Collaboration agreements may involve a series of milestone payments and bonus payments as the collaboration successfully progresses. These amounts represent variable consideration which are only included in the transaction price to the extent that it is highly probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recognised will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is subsequently resolved. This is typically only when the milestone or bonus is achieved  as confirmed by the collaborator. Where payments are included in the transaction price  we estimate the amount to be included in the transaction price using the most likely amount method.At the end of each subsequent reporting period  Management re-evaluates the probability of achievement of relevant milestones and any related constraint. If necessary  we adjust our estimate of the overall transaction price. Any such adjustments are recorded on a cumulative catch-up basis  affecting revenue in the period of adjustment.Collaboration agreements include sales-based royalties  including commercial milestone payments based on the level of sales. Related revenue is recognised only as the subsequent underlying sales occur.Management has determined that costs directly attributable to the collaboration agreements are immaterial. Cost of sales has  therefore  not been presented.2.16 Other incomeThe Group recognises income for all government grants in relation to research and development  where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and attached conditions will be complied with.2.17 ExpensesOperating leasePayments (excluding costs for services and insurance) made under operating leases are recognised in the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease where these are short-term leases with a period remaining of less than twelve months or of low value. Other leases that are assessed under IFRS 16 as finance leases have been accounted for in accordance with IFRS.R&D expenditureR&D expenditure  which includes a proportion of staff costs and directly attributable overheads  is currently recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as incurred  on the basis that the recognition criteria of IAS 38 (Intangible Assets) are currently not met.2.18 Interest income and expenditureInterest income and expenditure is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as it accrues on a timely basis  by reference to the principal outstanding and effective interest rate applicable. Other finance income and expenditure relates to the fair value revaluation of the warrant liabilities at the balance sheet date  as well as the settlement of forward contracts.2.19 TaxationTax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity  in which case it is recognised in equity.Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year  using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date  and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill; the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination; and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities  using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary difference can be utilised.2.20 Issued capitalOrdinary and Sponsor shares are classified as equity. Proceeds in excess of the par value of the shares are shown as share premium in equity and incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction of share premium  net of tax  from the proceeds.2.21 ProvisionsA provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event  that can be reliably measured and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects risks specific to the liability  where this would be material.For the restructuring programme initiated in the year  the corresponding provision includes expenditure that is directly attributable and necessarily entailed by the programme and does not relate to the ongoing activities of the Group. Included in these costs are those associated with contractual obligations that no longer provide economic benefit to the Group.3 Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertaintyJudgements and estimates are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and other relevant factors  including Management’s reasonable expectations of future events. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires Management to make estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The estimates and the underlying assumptions are subject to continuous review.The Group based its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when the consolidated financial statements were prepared. Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments  however  may change due to market changes or circumstances arising that are beyond the control of the Group. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur.In preparing these consolidated financial statements  the significant judgements made by Management in applying the Group’s accounting policies and the key sources of estimation uncertainty are as follows.3.1 Critical judgements in applying accounting policiesRevenueThe second AZ collaboration  entered into in 2022  is related to two disease areas and has been treated by the Group as a separate agreement  since it has identified new and distinct performance obligations that did not exist in the previous agreement entered in 2021.This collaboration works across two disease areas using a similar methodology in each. In identifying the performance obligations within the contract  Management has made judgements in categorising each disease area as its own discrete performance obligation  where their delivery is both independent from one another and deemed to require an equal amount of effort  and where they are individually considered a distinct bundle of services.Similarly  the new collaboration entered into with Merck in the year relates to three separate disease areas  each considered to involve a distinct bundle of services. Each research plan includes upfront payments  in addition to separate and sequential discovery milestones which trigger collaboration payments to become due to BAI if successfully passed. The allocation of consideration for any performance obligation is an estimate based on the proportion of total expected directly attributable costs to be incurred in their delivery.Whilst the upfront payments are considered fixed consideration  the corresponding transaction price for each discovery milestone is seen as variable consideration and  therefore  factored in only when Management considers it at least highly probable that the associated milestone will be achieved.At the end of a research plan’s discovery phase  fees and royalties may become due to BAI as the asset progresses through further development and commercial milestones  with tiered royalties also payable on net sales of any commercialised products.GoodwillThe amount of goodwill initially recognised as a result of a business combination is dependent on the allocation of the purchase price to the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.The determination of the fair value of the assets and liabilities is based  to a considerable extent  on Management’s judgement and on industry benchmarks and information relevant to the specific assets in focus.Goodwill impairmentDuring 2023  Management has performed an impairment assessment on the goodwill in accordance with IAS 36. For the purposes of the impairment assessment  goodwill has been allocated to the Group’s CGU defined as the whole of the BAI Group. A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets. Management’s judgement  as part of its continued evaluation of the goodwill  has considered that the CGU for 2023  consistent with the conclusion in 2022  is the BAI Group  since Management considers that the assets held by BenevolentAI Cambridge Limited are now  and increasingly so  strategically integrated with the other legal entities in the Group. By this very nature  Management believes that  for any future commercial value created through the current and future drug programmes and collaboration delivery  a unified and amalgamated approach is required across the whole of the Group.Per IAS 36.6  impairment is recognised as administrative expense in the statement of comprehensive income if the recoverable value (the higher of FVLCOD or value in use) of an asset is less than its carrying value. Given Management’s judgement that the CGU is representative of the whole Group  the FVLCOD can be determined through the market capitalisation  determined through directly observable market prices. The value in use is determined through a combination of valuation techniques  including risk-adjusted net present value calculations of pipeline assets  operating costs and collaborations  alongside platform tools valued as multiples of potential revenue. These inherently involve Management judgements  benchmarked to industry standards wherever possible.3.2 Other accounting estimatesThe Group has not identified any significant accounting estimates  being those which present a significant risk of material adjustment in the next financial period. However  other areas of estimation uncertainty have been identified as follows:RevenueIn recognising revenue against the individual performance obligations  estimates have been made in the calculation of their percentage of completion  the key driver of revenue release. This requires an estimation of inputs needed to fully satisfy each performance obligation  including full-time equivalent days and risk-adjusted contingent costs where the satisfaction of performance obligations may require more work.SBP expense and employer-related social security provisionThe Group operates the BEIS and LTIP. The fair value of equity incentive awards  or respective portions of awards  related solely to non-market vesting conditions is measured using the Black Scholes model at each grant date. The number of equity instruments expected to vest which are tied to the non-market conditions is revisited at each balance sheet date so that  ultimately  the cumulative amount recognised over the vesting period is based on the number of instruments expected to eventually vest.The employer-related social security provision incorporates similar estimates and is remeasured to reflect the closing share price at the balance sheet date  which may ultimately not be equal to the share price that the corresponding awards are exercised at or settled at.The fair value of equity incentive award portions related to market vesting conditions is measured using the Monte Carlo Simulation model at each grant date. Provided all other vesting conditions are satisfied  a charge is made irrespective of whether the market vesting conditions are satisfied.The net increase in relative portion of fair value charge during the year is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. The assumptions used in both the Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo Simulation models are detailed in note 23.Fair value revaluation of Class A warrants and Class B warrantsThe Company's warrants are classified and presented as derivative financial liabilities and measured at fair value through profit or loss. The fair value of each warrant class is determined at each reporting date and exercise date and is based on quoted market prices  where available  or independently valued using the Binomial Tree method and Monte Carlo Simulation models  the inputs for which derive from significant observable market inputs (volatility  discount rate and share price).Restructuring programme provisionThe provision recognised in relation to the restructuring programme initiated by the Group in 2023 comprises a measurement of the expected costs directly attributable to carrying out the restructuring and necessarily entailed by the programme. The unused provision balance  therefore  represents an estimate of the costs until such a point that they are known.4 Accounting impact of the Business Combination in the prior yearThe Business Combination with Odyssey on 22 April 2022 (“Closing date”) was achieved through the contribution of ordinary and preferred shares in BenevolentAI Limited (“BAI Ltd”) in exchange for new ordinary shares in BenevolentAI (previously Odyssey)  the result being that the new BAI Group became listed on the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange.The Business Combination was accounted for within the scope of IFRS 2 as a capital reorganisation since Odyssey did not meet the definition of a business in accordance with IFRS 3. Under this accounting method  Odyssey was treated as the acquired company for financial reporting purposes  and the activity and position of the acquired Odyssey was considered in the consolidated financial statements only from the Closing date onwards.Accordingly  for financial reporting purposes  the Transaction was treated as the equivalent of BAI Ltd issuing shares at the closing of the Business Combination for the net assets of Odyssey at the Closing date. The capital reorganisation reflects the transition of the share capital and share premium from BAI Ltd to BenevolentAI  which comprised the legal essence of the Transaction. This resulted in a decrease within share capital and related increase to share premium  to align the equity of BAI Ltd (as the acquirer for financial reporting purposes) with the equity of the Group’s new ultimate legal parent  BenevolentAI. The book value accounted for on consolidation was reflected through a corresponding charge to merger difference  such that the net impact to equity was equal to the £5.2 million of net assets acquired.The excess of the fair value of consideration for Odyssey over the fair value of its identifiable net assets acquired represents a compensation for the service of a stock exchange listing for its shares and expenses as incurred. At the Closing date  the fair value of BAI Ltd’s shares that were deemed to be issued to Odyssey amounted to £88.3 million  based on the initial closing price of shares of Odyssey according to the table below. In return  BenevolentAI received Odyssey’s listing service and its net assets  equal to £5.2 million  which mainly consisted of remaining cash net of redemptions and liabilities related to the warrants. This resulted in a non-cash listing service SBP expense of £83.1 million  determined under IFRS 2 and recognised in",neutral,0.03,0.94,0.04,mixed,0.51,0.31,0.18,True,English,"['BenevolentAI Unaudited Preliminary Results', 'Year', 'low double-digit million-dollar upfront payment', 'retinoic acid receptor alpha beta', 'cutting edge AI-driven drug discovery', 'Drug substance manufacturing scale-up', 'oral phosphodiesterase 10 (PDE10) inhibitor', 'Dr. François Nader', 'five high potential assets', 'oral brain-penetrant CHK1 inhibitor', 'Phase Ia clinical study', 'patient-centric revenue generation strategy', 'Knowledge Exploration tools assessment', 'Phase IIa study results', 'Phase Ia study', 'biopharma drug discovery', 'drug discovery collaborations', 'novel drug candidates', 'Current market assessment', 'internal drug programmes', 'Dr. Joerg Moeller', 'challenging first half', 'topline data readout', 'metastatic brain tumours', 'amyotrophic lateral sclerosis', 'selective brain-penetrant RARɑβ', 'wider commercial strategy', 'Chief Revenue Officer', 'unaudited preliminary results', 'Chief Executive Officer', 'Chief Financial Officer', 'Independent Non-Executive Director', 'R&D spend', 'new expansion opportunity', 'significant operational progress', 'initial product development', 'New strategic collaboration', 'regulatory IND-enabling studies', 'new Merck collaboration', 'R&D leader', 'glioblastoma multiforme asset', 'oral, potent', 'pipeline assets', 'financial results', 'significant collaboration', 'Regulatory News', 'Operational highlights', 'commercial milestones', 'selective agonist', 'AstraZeneca collaboration', 'strategic review', 'Significant appointments', '2023 financial highlights', 'lead asset', 'ALS) asset', 'Euronext Amsterdam', 'advanced AI', 'twelve months', 'inaugural set', 'noteworthy achievements', 'ulcerative colitis', 'life-changing medicines', 'brief tenure', 'lasting impact', 'major deal', 'Pharma partner', 'Merck KGaA', 'three targets', 'tiered royalties', 'net sales', 'IND-ready status', 'atopic dermatitis', 'primary endpoints', 'secondary endpoints', 'proprietary pipeline', 'user testing', 'early Q2', 'key areas', 'prediction methodology', 'Corporate highlights', 'Joanna Shields', 'additional role', 'Catherine Isted', 'Christina Busmalis', 'Marcello Damiani', 'collaboration partners', 'pre-clinical development', 'GBM) asset', 'Benevolent Platform™', 'Leadership team', 'post period', 'share-based payments', 'Acting CEO', 'BenevolentAI', 'Company', 'Group', 'BAI', 'signing', 'completion', 'initiation', 'near', 'year', 'mission', 'patients', 'talent', 'commitment', 'lives', 'agreement', 'oncology', 'neurology', 'immunology', 'treatment', 'BEN-8744', 'mid-20', 'investment', 'May', 'safety', 'tolerability', 'efficacy', 'operations', 'business', 'enhancement', 'Work', 'capabilities', 'offerings', 'Board', 'January', 'resignation', 'September', 'Chair', 'strengthening', 'decreased', 'revenues', '1 research', 'SBP']",2024-03-14,2024-03-15,marketscreener.com

The Group achieved excellent consolidated earnings  significantly higher than the previous year. The Group's current configuration  also in light of the economic and financial results achieved in 2023  allows us to predict further improvement for 2024 of results even with the same consolidation scope""  underlined Antonio Porro  CEO of the Mondadori Group.Consolidated revenues for 2023 amounted to € 904.7 million  a slight increase (+0.2%) on the € 903 million recorded in 2022. Net of the changes in consolidation scope between the two financial years  the organic growth in revenues rose to 1.1%.The Adjusted EBITDA for 2023 of € 152.1 million (compared to € 136.3 million in 2022) shows an increase of almost € 16 million (+11.5% and consistent with the guidance  which estimated a high single/low double-digit increase) to which all business areas contribute.Netting the results for the two periods in question of the reliefs and contributions respectively paid  the growth recorded by Group's Adjusted EBITDA would exceed € 19 million (+14.2%). Two thirds of this result is derived from the operating performance of the original consolidation scope (thanks  in particular  to the Education and Retail Books areas) and the remaining part is mainly attributable to the consolidation of the new companies acquired in the Trade Books area.Overall  profitability stood at 16.8%  up by almost 2 percentage points from around 15% in the 2022 financial year and in the upper part of the target range previously communicated to the market.The Group EBITDA for the 2023 financial year was € 148.9 million  compared to € 130.7 million in 2022  highlighting an € 18.2 million improvement (+13.9%) attributable to the favourable trend in some operating components and the recognition in the 2023 financial year  in the Media area  of the net capital gain resulting from the sale of the Grazia and Icon magazines (and the related international network).The 2023 EBIT was positive in the amount of € 84.2 million  showing an improvement of € 11.5 million compared to 2022 (+15.8%). Neutralising the extraordinary items and the impacts of the PPA and impairment processes  the Adjusted EBIT would stand at € 102 million  up by approximately € 12 million (+13.1%) compared to the previous year.Financial charges recorded an overall increase of over € 2 million  with approximately € 0.5 million resulting from the higher cost of debt - despite a reduction in average exposure - and the remaining € 1.6 million resulting from higher costs arising from the accounting effects of IFRS 16 which  in the 2022 financial year  had allowed non-recurring income (approximately € 1.4 million) linked to the early closure of the old rental contract for the Segrate headquarters to be recognised.Consolidated result before tax were positive at € 80.5 million  up by about € 14 million (+20.4%) from € 66.9 million in 2022. Also contributing to this performance was an improvement of over € 4 million in the earnings of associates  resulting in particular from: the updated fair value measurement of the investments in A.L.I. and Adgage for a total of approximately € 2 million; the recognition of a capital gain - net of the negative result for the first four months - of € 0.4 million relating to the sale in April 2023 of the residual investment in SEE  the publishing company of Il Giornale  which reported a loss of approximately € 1.8 million in the previous year; the absence of the write-down of the equity investment in Attica  which had a € 1.7 million impact on the 2022 financial year.The Mondadori Group's net profit for the year to 31 December 2023  after minority interests  amounted to € 62.4 million  a significant improvement of about 20%  in line with expectations and despite the impairment  equivalent to € 10.3 million  compared to € 52.1 million in 2022. The net profit for 2023 triples the value of the 2019 financial year.Tax costs in the period totalled € 17.9 million versus € 15.3 million in 2022 due to the higher pre-tax result.Adjusted net profit for the 2023 financial year  neutralising all non-recurring items previously mentioned  would amount to about € 71 million  up by around 11% on the previous year (€ 63.9 million).The Net Financial Position excluding IFRS 16 as of 31 December 2023 was € -86.1 million (net debt)  an improvement of € 20 million compared to € -106 million in 2022  due to significant cash generation by the business and despite the dividend distribution cash-out. In the financial year 2023  the Group distributed dividends totalling approximately € 29 million  equivalent to a pay-out of 55% of the 2022 net profit.The IFRS 16 Net Financial Position as of 31 December 2023 amounted to € -158.6 million (net debt)  from € -177.4 million in 2022  due to an IFRS 16 debt component of € -72.5 million. The Adjusted NFP/EBITDA ratio is 1.0x  exactly in line with the target communicated to the market and down from 1.3x at the end of 2022.At € 68.7 million  cash flow from ordinary activities (after cash-outs due to financial expenses and taxes) for the financial year 2023 is 15.1% higher than the figure for 2022 and is at the high end of the guidance (EUR 65-70 million).As of 31 December 2023  the extraordinary cash flow was negative by € 15.3 million  mainly due to net cash-outs related to merger & acquisition activities of around € 5 million and restructuring costs of around € 5 million.Free Cash Flow as of 31 December 2023 was positive at € 53.5 million and confirms the Group's ability to finance its inorganic growth policy and the distribution of significant dividends to shareholders.As of 31 December 2023  the Mondadori Group employed 1 945 people  an increase of 2.4% compared to the 1 900 employed at 31 December 2022 (+45 people).TradeBOOKS AREAFollowing the consolidation phase in 2022  in 2023 the book market showed furthergrowth in value of 3.4% and a substantial stability in volume. In the fourth quarter  the value increased by 5.7% thanks to the excellent earnings recorded during the Christmas season.In this context  the Mondadori Group's publishing houses grew by 3.7% across 2023  outperforming the market of reference - particularly thanks to the excellent earnings achieved in the first and fourth quarters from the publication of titles such as Spare - Il minore (""Spare""). by Prince Harry  Le armi della luce (""The Weapons of Light"") by Ken Follett  published by Mondadori  and La vita intima by Nicolò Ammaniti  published by Einaudi -  and consolidate their leadership nationally with a market share of 27.6% at the end of 2023.Revenues for 2023 amounted to € 374.3 million  having grown by around 10.4% compared to the previous year  also due to the consolidation of the recently acquired companies (A.L.I. and Star Comics).Adjusted EBITDA was € 59.2 million: net of the reliefs relating to Electa's museum activities  amounting to € 6.4 million  from which the 2022 financial year had benefited  the area recorded an increase in its margin of around 22% (+ € 10.5 million)  largely attributable to the contribution of the new companies consolidated from 2023  despite the negative impact of the higher cost of paper compared to the previous period. The profitability achieved by the Trade Books area was 15.8% in 2023  showing improvement on 2022  excluding the contribution of the reliefs (14.4%).Education BOOKS AREAThe Schools market (primary and secondary schools) in Italy in 2023 is estimated to have grown by around 3.5% on the previous year to approximately € 618 million.In the 2023 financial year  the Mondadori Group's publishing houses confirmed their leadership at national level  with a 32% share of the set texts market  substantially stable compared to 2022  due to growth in the secondary school segment (middle and high schools) and a decline in primary schools.Revenues in the area were € 237.5 million (€ 237.3 million in 2022)  stable compared to the previous year. In particular  lower and upper secondary school revenues  which account for over 80% of the area's revenues  grew by around 5%  versus a fall in primary school revenues (-6.5% compared to 2022). In addition to the above  there was a decline of approximately 6% in the distribution and sale of third-party products by Rizzoli Education (dedicated to the teaching of foreign languages) and a contraction in sales of non-set text products.The area's Adjusted EBITDA in 2023 was € 67.7 million  a distinct improvement on the € 63.5 million recorded in 2022 (+6.7%)  thanks to the contribution of all publishing houses and the full completion of the synergies resulting from the integration of D Scuola.The 28.5% profitability in 2023 was higher than that recorded in 2022 (26.7%) thanks to the lower incidence of industrial costs - as a result of the lower cost of paper purchases  down by around € 4 million - and promotional costs.RETAILAREAIn a context of growth in the Italian market  there was an improvement in the physical channel (+4.3%) and a recovery in the online channel  which saw a gradual recovery in the fourth quarter  closing the year with an increase of 2%.In 2023  Mondadori Retail grew by 5.6%  outperforming the market of reference for the third consecutive year. Thanks to this result  which was due to the excellent performance of physical shops  Mondadori Retail's market share grew to 12.8% (+0.3% compared with 31 December 2022) of the total market and was close to 20% of the physical market. The ongoing development and renovation of existing stores and the focus on the core business of books enabled the Mondadori bookshop network to consolidate its role in the market.The transformation process launched over the past years has made for an improvement in operating and management performance  as shown in the income statement for 2023  which highlights strong growth in revenue and margins of the Retail area.Revenues amounted to € 199.5 million  up 5.4% (+ € 10.3 million) on the previous year  the highest value recorded since the pre-pandemic year 2019.An analysis of sales by channel shows further growth in revenues from direct bookshops (+10.3% compared with the previous year)  franchised bookshops (+4.5% compared with 2022) and the online channel (+3.1% compared with the previous year).Books  the Mondadori Group's core business  provided the greatest revenues (over 80% of the total)  having grown overall by 6.1% compared with 2022  driven by the excellent performance of physical stores; the non-book turnover recorded a positive trend (+14.4% compared with 2022)  thanks to growth in the impulse sector (stationery and gifts).The area shows a positive Adjusted EBITDA of € 14 million  up by more than 50% compared to 2022 (+ € 4.9 million)  confirming a gradual improvement in performance (in 2019  Adjusted EBITDA was € 5 million).It is important to note that the area's 2023 income statement returned to profit after more than a decade  closing with a positive net profit of € 1.5 million  an improvement of € 3 million compared to the loss of € -1.4 million in 2022.MEDIAAREAIn 2023  the Mondadori Group confirmed its position as Italy's leading multimedia publisher: in print  with 13 magazines and 9 million readers and a market share (in terms of circulation) of 20.3%  slightly up - on a like-for-like portfolio of titles - compared with December 2022 (19.8%); online  with 12 brands and an average of around 28 million unique users/month; in social media  with more than 110 profiles and a fanbase of around 103 million as of 31 December 2023.In the financial year 2023  revenues in the Media area amounted to € 141 million  down by 20.6% compared to the previous year. On a like-for-like basis  this contraction was reduced to 2.7% by the positive performance achieved in the fourth quarter of the year (+7% approximately) and highlights different trends in the two components: digital and print.Digital activities  which account for around 40% of total turnover for the area  recorded an increase in advertising revenues of around 23%  mainly due to the positive performance of the MarTech segment; print activities fell by 14.8%  mainly due to the decline in add-on sales for the entire year caused by the decision to reduce releases in low-margin products such as music and home video.Adjusted EBITDA amounted to € 16.4 million  about +16% year-on-year  attributable to both business segments. The EBITDA margin recorded an increase of almost 4 percentage points  from 7.9% to 11.7%. Specifically: in the print area  the increase was due to the rationalisation of the portfolio of activities with more stable profitability  the constant attention being paid to the development and rationalisation of costs  as well as the recognition of a tax credit to partially offset the costs incurred by the publisher for magazine distribution activities; in the digital area  adjusted EBITDA increased by approximately € 1 million compared to the previous year  thanks to higher revenues and the contribution of new initiatives  despite the earnings from the digital activities of the magazines sold being removed from the consolidation scope.The Group's current configuration  economic performance and cash generation capacity  also demonstrated in 2023  point to a further improvement in results for 2024  even on a like-for-like basis.From a strategic point of view  the Group intends to continue the process of strengthening its core business in the Trade Books area  both in publishing  by emphasising the identity and specialisation of the various publishing houses  and by continuing the process of vertical integration in the various stages of the book chain  particularly in the comics segment  by taking full advantage of the distribution synergies arising from the acquisition of Star Shop.In the Education Books area  it will continue to focus on the most profitable segments of the textbook market and consolidating its domestic leadership  strengthening and renewing its editorial offer and taking full advantage of the digital convergence process (through the development of a new single digital platform for all three publishing houses).In the Retail area  the Mondadori Group will continue with the selective development of its network of shops  both direct - by opening around ten new outlets - and franchised  as well as with improving the sales surface area  maximising the efficiency of the network and enriching its range of publications  which is essential both to increase the profitability of the area and to improve its effectiveness in conveying the Group's editorial offer to the market.In the Media area  the Mondadori Group will at the same time continue to strengthen its competitive positioning by developing its skills and offer in the digital area  in particular through initiatives in the content creator  Food and MarTech segments.Income StatementThe following are the Group's economic and financial targets for the financial year 2024  based on a consolidation scope that includes only completed extraordinary transactions (Star Shop):low single-digit revenue growth ;; mid single-digit growth in the Adjusted EBITDA  with margins expected to remain stable at around 17%  thanks to targeted pricing policies and the further reduction of paper and printing costs.At the end of the next three-year period  i.e. in the financial year 2026  with the consolidation scope described above and therefore with the only organic growth  the Group estimates that it will be able to achieve consolidated revenues in the region of € 1 billion and a proportional growth in margins that will enable it to confirm profitability approximately at 17%.Cash Flow and Net Financial PositionIn the three-year period 2024-2026  the Group is expected to confirm the significant cash generation capacity shown in 2023 and therefore cash flow from ordinary operations of no less than € 70 million.The Group's significant cash generation over the next three years will be allocated to maximising the company's value creation  through an active investment policy in its core and adjacent businesses aimed at seizing opportunities to strengthen its leadership  expand geographically and/or expand its presence within the book value chain. This development strategy will be accompanied by an increasing shareholder remuneration policy  through a more consistent Dividend Policy that provides for  each year of the three-year-period  the distribution of 50% of the Ordinary Cash Flow per share (from the previous 40%) or the Dividend per Share of the previous year increased by 10%  whichever is the greater.Each year  the Board of Directors  when proposing the distribution to the Shareholders' Meeting  will take account of the general macroeconomic scenario  as well as the expected cash flows and the Group's equity and financial structure.The Parent Company's income statement at 31 December 2023 shows the same profit as in the consolidated financial statements of € 62.4 million (€ 52.1 million in 2022)  due to the fact that the Company has chosen to use the equity method to measure its investments in the separate financial statements.Revenues  which consist of the costs of central structures charged back to the subsidiaries  amounting to € 43.1 million  increased by about 3% compared to the previous year  due to higher charges (related to IT services and occupied space) resulting from the expansion of the Group's consolidation scope and the respective offices.Adjusted EBITDA in 2023 was € -5.6 million  essentially stable compared to 2022 (€ -5.7 million in 2022).Reported EBITDA for 2023 was € -7.5 million  down from 2022 (€ -6.7 million)  mainly due to higher allocations related to restructuring costs.Based on the results of the 2023 financial year  the Board of Directors will submit a proposal to the next Shareholders' Meeting  convened on 24 April 2024  for the distribution of a dividend per share of € 0.12  gross of withholding taxes  for each ordinary share (net of treasury shares) outstanding at the record date.The total dividend amounted to approximately € 31 million  up by 9% compared to the previous year: this amount corresponds to a pay-out of 50% of the net profit for 2023 and a dividend yield of almost 6% (as of 31 December 2023). The amount will be paid by drawing on the distributable portion of the extraordinary reserve (included in the equity item ""Other reserves profit/loss carried forward"").In compliance with the provisions of the ""Regulations for markets organised and managed by Borsa Italiana S.p.A."" and as already announced  the dividend will be paid in two equal tranches:unit amount of € 0.06 for each ordinary share (net of treasury shares) outstanding at the record date stated below  from 22 May 2024 (payment date)  with ex-dividend date no. 23 on 20 May 2024 (ex date) and with the date of entitlement to payment of the dividend  pursuant to Article 83-terdecies of the TUF (record date)  on 21 May 2024;unit amount of € 0.06 for each ordinary share (net of treasury shares) outstanding on the record date stated below  from 20 November 2024 (payment date)  with ex-dividend date no. 24 on 18 November 2024 (ex date) and with the date of entitlement to payment of the dividend  pursuant to Article 83-terdecies of the TUF (record date)  on 19 November 2024.On 1 February 2024  through its subsidiary Mondadori Libri S.p.A.  the Mondadori Group finalised the acquisition of 51% of the share capital of Star Shop Distribuzione S.r.l.  which operates in the comic book and gadget segment and is particularly active in the distribution of third-party publishers in the comic book shop channel and in the management of sales outlets - direct and affiliated - in the same segment. As communicated to the market on 29 June 2023  following authorisation by the Italian Antitrust Authority pursuant to Law 287/1990 - as previously announced on 3 November 2023 -  the transaction is effective from 1 February 2024  as of which Mondadori will also proceed with the line-by-line consolidation of the company.Following expiry of the previous authorization resolved upon by the Shareholders' Meeting on 27 April 2023  with the approval of the financial statements at 31 December 2023  the Board of Directors will propose to the next Shareholders' Meeting  called for 24 April 2024  the renewal of the authorization to purchase and dispose of treasury shares with the aim of retaining the applicability of law provisions in the matter of any additional buyback plans and  consequently  of seizing any investment and operational opportunities involving treasury shares.Below are the main elements of the Board of Directors' proposal  which are consistent with those of the expired authorization:MotivationsThe motivations underlying the request for the authorization to purchase and sell treasury shares refer to the opportunity to attribute to the Board of Directors the power to:use the Treasury Shares purchased or already in the Company portfolio as compensation for the acquisition of interests within the framework of the Company's investments;use the treasury shares purchased or already held in portfolio against the exercise of option rights  including conversion rights  deriving from financial instruments issued by the Company  its subsidiaries or third parties and to use the treasury shares for lending  exchange or transfer transactions or to support extraordinary transactions on the Company's capital or financing transactions that imply the transfer or sale of treasury shares;undertake any investments  directly or through intermediaries  including for the purpose of containing abnormal movements in share prices  stabilizing share trading and prices  supporting the liquidity of the share on the market  in order to foster the regular conduct of trading beyond normal fluctuations related to market performance  without prejudice in any case to compliance with applicable statutory provisions;rely on investment or divestment opportunities  if considered strategic by the Board of Directors  also in relation to available liquidity;dispose of treasury shares to service share-based incentive plans set up pursuant to Article 114-bis of the TUF  and plans for the free allocation of shares to employees or members of the governing bodies of the Company or to Shareholders.DurationThe authorization to purchase treasury shares runs from the date of any resolution approving the proposal by the Shareholders' Meeting  until the Shareholders' Meeting called to approve the financial statements at 31 December 2024 and  in any case  for a period no more than 18 months after that date. The authorization to dispose of treasury shares is requested for an unlimited period  given the absence of time limits pursuant to current regulations and the opportunity to allow the Board of Directors to make use of the maximum flexibility  also in terms of time  to carry out any disposal of shares.Maximum number of purchasable treasury sharesThe authorisation would allow the purchase  on one or more occasions and in one or more tranches  of a maximum number of ordinary shares with a nominal unitary value of € 0.26  which - considering the treasury shares already held by the Company and the shares that may possibly be acquired by subsidiaries - shall not exceed a total of 10% of the share capital.Pursuant to article 2357(1) of the Italian Civil Code  the purchase transactions will be carried out within the limits of the distributable profits and available reserves resulting from the last regularly approved financial statements at the time of each potential purchase transaction. The authorisation would include the right to subsequently dispose of the treasury shares acquired  in whole or in part  on one or more occasions and even before having exhausted the maximum number of purchasable shares.Criteria for purchasing treasury shares and indication of the minimum and maximum purchasing capPurchases would be made in accordance with articles 132 of the TUF  144-bis(1)(b) and d-ter) of the Issuers' Regulation  and thus:(i) on regulated markets or multilateral trading systems  according to the operating criteria established in the organisation and management regulations of the same markets  which do not allow the direct matching of purchase trading proposals with predetermined sales trading proposals  as well as in compliance with any other legislation in force  including European ones.(ii) by the methods established by the market practices permitted by Consob  pursuant to the combined provisions of article 180(1)(c) of the TUF and article 13 of Regulation (EU) no. 596 of 16 April 2014 (""Permitted Market Practices"").Additionally  share purchase transactions may also be carried out in the manner envisaged in Article 3 of EU Delegated Regulation no. 2016/1052 in order to benefit  if the conditions are met  from the exemption under Article 5  paragraph 1  of EU Regulation no. 596/2014 on market abuse with regard to inside information and market manipulation.The disposal of treasury shares may be made  on one or more occasions and even before having terminated the maximum number of purchasable treasury shares  either by selling them on regulated markets or according to other trading methods in compliance with the law  including EU law  in force and with the Admitted Market Practices  if applicable. The authorisation proposal provides that purchases are made at a unit price  compliant with any regulatory requirements  including European ones  or permitted market practices in force at the time  where applicable  without prejudice to the fact that the minimum and maximum purchase price will be set at a unit price no lower than the official stock market price of the Mondadori stock on the day prior to the day on which the purchase transaction is carried out  decreased by 20%  and no higher than the official stock market price on the day before the day on which the purchase transaction will be carried out  increased by 10%.

The Plan  which is reserved for the same beneficiaries as the 2024-2026 Performance Share Plan  governs the determination  subject to the achievement of specific individual and Group performance objectives  of the annual Variable Remuneration (MBO) for the year 2024. In particular  the Plan envisages a voluntary mechanism for the conversion into Mondadori shares of a percentage component equal to 15% or 30% of the Variable Remuneration itself  as well as the disbursement of an additional ""bonus"" component in shares  equal to the number of shares resulting from the conversion.Any allocation of the total component in shares would take place at the end of a 24-month deferral period with respect to the MBO vesting date.For details on the proposed adoption of the 2024 Short-term Incentive Plan (MBO)  the beneficiaries and the characteristics of said Plan  reference should be made to the Information Document approved by the Board of Directors  pursuant to Article 84-bis and annex 3A of the Issuer Regulation  and to the Explanatory Report  which will be published within the time limits and in the manner prescribed by applicable regulations.The Board of Directors will propose the Shareholders' Meeting  called on 24 April 2024  also in extraordinary session  to adopt the resolutions referred to in articles 2443 and 2420 ter of the Italian Civil Code  relating to the renewal of the Board's powers to increase the share capital and issue convertible bonds.Specifically  the Board will propose to the Shareholders' Meeting:- the renewal of the proxies already granted to the Board of Directors by the Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting of 17 April 2019 and terminating due to expiry of the related five-year term  which  pursuant to Articles 2443 and 2420-ter of the Italian Civil Code  grant the Board of Directors the power to increase the share capital  reserved as an option to those entitled thereto  by a maximum nominal amount of € 75 000 000 and to issue convertible bonds for a maximum nominal amount of € 250 000 000.- the renewal of the proxy already granted to the Board of Directors by the Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting of 17 April 2019 and also terminating  granting the Board of Directors  for the same period of five years  the power to increase the share capital within the limit of 10% of the pre-existing share capital and in any case within the limit of a nominal amount of € 20 000 000  with the exclusion of option rights pursuant to Articles 2443 and 2441(4) of the Italian Civil Code.The renewals are proposed under the same conditions of the terminating proxies unused by the Board and for a further period of five years corresponding to the maximum term allowed by the law.The proposals for the renewal of proxies are motivated by the advisability of maintaining the general power of the Board of Directors to implement any capital transactions through faster and more streamlined procedures than the resolutions adopted by the Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting.Under Legislative Decree 254/2016  the Board of Directors' 2023 Report on Operations of the Mondadori Group is also composed of the Consolidated Non-Financial Statement (NFS)  a qualitative-quantitative description of the non-financial performance of the Company  associated with environmental  social  and staff-related issues  as well as those regarding respect for human rights  and the fight against corruption and bribery  which are relevant given the activities and characteristics of the Company.The NFS was prepared in accordance with GRI Standards: In accordance option  and includes benchmark KPIs related to GRI G4 ""Media Sector Disclosure"".With regard to 2023  the Mondadori Group has updated its materiality analysis  consistent with the principles set out by the GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards (GRI Standards) and the reporting scopes laid down by Legislative Decree 254/2016.In 2023  stakeholder engagement was pursued through the involvement of employees  teachers  bookshop customers  suppliers and financial analysts and investors  with more than 4 500 responses to the engagement questionnaire.The document also includes the references required by Regulation (EU) 2020/852 related to the introduction of the European Taxonomy.SUSTAINABILITY PLANActions and initiatives in the ESG area are highlighted as part of the reporting activity.

As a company built on the unique and successful strategy of repurposing and reformulating existing pharmaceuticals  we achieved a major milestone with the U.S. approval of Maxigesic® IV in partnership with AFT Pharmaceuticals  marking a crucial step in delivering this innovative pain management solution to American patients.Additionally  approval was secured for Podofilox gel  the first generic version of Condylox® Gel  expanding access to this medication. Our unwavering commitment to research and development yielded impressive progress across our diverse product pipeline. These advancements solidify our position as a leader in providing solutions to unmet medical needs in the years to come. We are incredibly proud of our team's dedication and resilience throughout this transformative year.Looking ahead to 2024  Hyloris is poised for continued growth and innovation. We plan to significantly bolster our pipeline with the addition of several new product candidates addressing critical unmet medical needs. Recent additions  including treatments for Vulvar Lichen Sclerosus and Burning Mouth Syndrome  demonstrate our commitment to expanding our portfolio and addressing a wider range of patient needs. We remain confident in our ability to continue delivering value to patients  shareholders  and all stakeholders and expect continued growth beyond 2024.Commercial HighlightsMaxigesic® IV is a patented  unique combination  intravenous formulation for the treatment of post-operative pain and is currently licensed to partners covering over 100 countries across the globe.During 2023 and early 2024:A marketing authorization was granted by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in October 2023.Hikma Pharmaceuticals (Hikma)  a leading supplier of complex injectable hospital products  has launched the product in the U.S. under the tradename Combogesic® IV. An exclusive license and distribution agreement had previously been signed between Hyloris’ partner AFT Pharmaceuticals (AFT) and Hikma.Additional submissions for marketing authorization were made in 13 countries in the Middle East  Africa  Latin America  and Asia.Additional marketing authorizations have been granted in 8 countries including Poland  South Africa  and Spain. In early 2024  Health Canada granted approval bringing the total number of approvals to 50.Launches occurred in 14 countries including Norway  Singapore  Belgium  The Netherlands  the Czech Republic  and Romania. Imminent launches are expected in several additional countries  bringing the total number of countries where Maxigesic® IV will be available up to more than 30.In the United States  chronic opioid usage in patients following surgery averages around 9%  ranging from 4% to 24% among various specialties. Drug overdoses involving opioids resulted in over 80.000 deaths in the U.S. in 2021. Patients who experienced an opioid overdose accounted for nearly $2 billion in annual hospital costs.Sotalol IV is a patented  intravenous formulation of Sotalol for the treatment of atrial fibrillation  and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias developed for the U.S. Sotalol IV potentially allows to significantly reduce the length of hospital stay and the overall cost of care and potentially improve patient outcomes.Hyloris is taking further steps targeting to increase product related revenues in the future (see also: Ongoing Legal Proceedings).Podofilox Gel (Product previously referenced as HY-016)In December 2023  our partner Padagis US LLC (Padagis) received marketing authorization for Podofilox gel 0.5% from the FDA. Padagis launched the product in December 2023. It is the first generic for Condylox® Gel in the U.S.Podofilox Gel is an antimycotic drug for the topical treatment of external genital and perianal warts caused by certain types of the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV). Around 1% of the sexually active population in the U.S. presents with genital or perianal warts.1 To date there is a vaccine for HPV but no cure.For the 12 months period ending December 2022  Condylox® Gel had U.S. sales of approximately $9 million according to IQVIA Health.Other Commercial HighlightsTranexamic Acid RTUAdditional out-licensing agreements were signed for Tranexamic Acid RTU in 2023. These agreements cover a large European country and several major Asian countries  with a combined population of over 60 million people. Previous agreements have been signed in 2021 for Australia  New-Zealand and Canada. In 2023  our licensing partner for Canada submitted an application for approval by Health Canada. Additional regulatory submissions in the partnered territories are in progress  and more out-licensing agreements are expected going forward. An Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) has been submitted to the U.S. FDA.Tranexamic acid injection is an established antifibrinolytic agent used in emergency situations with major hemorrhages and is also used as a prophylactic agent in surgeries. Hyloris is developing a ready-to-use (RTU) formulation for infusion.Atomoxetine Oral LiquidAn out-licensing agreement was signed with Kye Pharmaceuticals (Kye) in October 2023. Kye will exclusively commercialize the product in Canada where atomoxetine is currently not available as an oral liquid formulation. The introduction of an oral liquid formulation in the ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) medication category has historically led to significant market share gains2. This suggests a strong potential for Atomoxetine Oral Liquid in Canada  where an estimated 1.8 million people (or 4-6% of adults and 5-7% of children) are diagnosed with ADHD3. ADHD is a chronic condition  with symptoms persisting into adulthood for 60-80% of patients4.Under the terms of the agreement  Hyloris will be eligible to receive attractive sales-related milestone payments (totaling up to USD 7.5 million)  and a substantial share of the generated revenue.New Pipeline Product CandidatesOur business development team leverages its expertise in existing products  real-world data  and a vast network to identify unmet medical needs. This includes collaborating with healthcare professionals  patient groups  insurers (payors)  and industry partners. In 2023 over 87 opportunities were screened and 3 product candidates will meet our investment criteria of €7 million5 in 7 years or less.For product candidates which Hyloris intends to out-license  the strategic goal is to capture a substantial part of the net product margin realized by our commercial partners. Hyloris aims to achieve this by partnering these assets close to regulatory submission  except in countries where additional local clinical trials are required. In general  we will prioritize in-market product sales or profit-based participation over (upfront) milestone payments.We aim to increase our product portfolio to 30 assets by 2025  with a focus on accelerating pipeline growth in the near future.HY-091  a novel topical treatment candidate for Vulvar Lichen Sclerosus (VLS) was announced in January 2024. VLS is a chronic inflammatory condition affecting an estimated 3% of women  causing severe pain  itching  and discomfort  significantly impacting their quality of life. HY-091 is being developed as a convenient and user-friendly treatment specifically designed to target these VLS symptoms.Hyloris has partnered with AFT for co-development  registration  and worldwide commercialization.HY-090  a promising new treatment candidate for Burning Mouth Syndrome (BMS) was announced in December 2023.BMS is a chronic condition affecting millions  primarily postmenopausal women  causing a burning  tingling  or scalding sensation in the mouth for months at a time. While the mouth appears healthy  sufferers may also experience dry mouth or taste alterations  the exact cause of BMS remains unknown. Studies suggest that 0.7% to 5% of individuals in the U.S. might be affected6.Hyloris has partnered with AFT to co-develop and commercialize the product worldwide.HY-088 was announced in January 2023. This novel  proprietary oral formulation will be administered to patients with hypophosphatemia – a condition where the blood level of phosphorus is lower than 2.5mg/dL. Patients can develop hypophosphatemia from either a genetic abnormality (such as Cushing Syndrome or osteomalacia) or an acquired condition (like long-term use of diuretics or phosphate binders).It is estimated hypophosphatemia affects around 5% of hospitalized patients  and a subpopulation needs direct treatment during and/or after their hospital stay.Treatment protocols for patients deficient in phosphate are well-established and have proven useful in other situations of bone mineral imbalance. Oral administration is the preferred way of treating hypophosphatemia  although in most countries no approved drugs exist. Currently  physicians mostly rely on compounded drugs which have  by definition  not been submitted for regulatory scrutiny regarding safety  efficacy  and quality.R&D UpdateThroughout 2023  Hyloris achieved significant advancements across the entire R&D portfolio  propelling the 18 product candidates and 3 high-barrier generics closer to commercialization. Key milestones were met for multiple programs  and discussions with regulatory agencies and partners are underway to solidify development plans. As a result  Hyloris anticipates submitting multiple INDs (Investigational New Drug applications) and NDAs (New Drug Applications) throughout 2024 and early 2025.Enhanced Capabilities Drive EfficiencyFurther bolstering our R&D efforts  Hyloris officially opened its new and improved R&D lab at the Montlegia Science Park in June 2023. This on-site facility allows Hyloris to perform drug formulation and analytical activities in-house  streamlining processes and optimizing resource allocation for the expanding pipeline.Cardiovascular PortfolioHyloris is actively engaged in advancing a comprehensive portfolio dedicated to addressing a wide range of conditions within the largest global treatment category – cardiovascular care. These products are currently progressing through or towards clinical trials  with the aim of significantly enhancing the quality of life for patients.Main highlights for 2023 and selected expected milestones for 2024 include:Aspirin IV: Registration batches have been manufactured and the stability study is ongoing. An NDA submission is planned for the U.S. as soon as all necessary data has been collected.Aspirin IV is an intravenous (IV) formulation of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) to be used in an emergency setting. Aspirin is not available in the U.S. as an IV product. Currently  most patients suspected of having an emergency cardiovascular event (such as a myocardial infarction or stroke) are immediately given oral aspirin to decrease their risk of morbidity and mortality.Milrinone: The optimization of the extended-release formulation for alcohol resistance marked a significant development milestone. Preparations for a pilot pharmacokinetic (PK) study are in progress.Oral milrinone is being developed as a novel  extended-release formulation offering convenient oral dosing for a selected population of end-stage heart failure (HF) patients who have Left Ventricular Assist Devices (LVADs).HY-074: All non-clinical studies were completed in 2023. A patent application was filed through the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) which allows an applicant to seek patent protection in several different countries – including the U.S. Hyloris is targeting an IND submission for Q2 2024 for the PK bridging study expected to start at the end of 2024.HY-074 is an intravenous formulation of current standard of care treatment for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) to offer faster onset of action  more convenient administration  and dosage control. It is currently available in oral form  which should allow for an optimal switching strategy from the oral form to an IV in a hospital setting.Dofetilide IV: Registration batches have been manufactured and the stability study is ongoing. A CRO has been selected for the required clinical study. An NDA submission is planned for the U.S. as soon as all necessary data has been collected.A pivotal clinical study to support regulatory submission for Dofetilide IV is nearing completion  with results expected by Q3 2024. Additional U.S. patent applications have been filed to bolster the drug's intellectual property protection.Other Value-Added ProgramsHyloris  in collaboration with its development partners  is achieving consistent progress on all stages of our value-added programs.Main highlights for 2023 and expected milestones for 2024 include:Tranexamic Acid Oral Mouth Rinse (previously HY-004): A Type A meeting with the FDA resulted in alignment on the phase 3 study protocol. The phase 3 trial began in November 2023  enrolling the first patient in early 2024. Completion of enrollment (Last Patient Last Visit - LPLV) is expected by year-end  with study results anticipated in the first half of 2025.This rinse targets patients on blood thinners (anticoagulant therapies) undergoing dental procedures with a high risk of excessive bleeding. Additionally  Hyloris intends to explore the effectiveness in a wider range of related oral surgery procedures  encompassing both patients with and without bleeding disorders who could benefit from a localized treatment to reduce blood clotting.Miconazole/Domiphen Bromide: Hyloris is co-developing Miconazole/Domiphen Bromide (MCZ/DB) with Purna Female Healthcare  a topical cream combining miconazole and domiphen bromide. This innovative treatment targets Recurrent Vulvovaginal Candidiasis (rVVC)  a chronic and often debilitating vaginal yeast infection affecting nearly 1 in 10 women throughout their lives.The Phase 2 clinical trial  completed in late 2023 (Q4)  showed promising results. The low-dose group exhibited evidence of delayed disease recurrence at day 29. These findings will be used to design the next clinical trial  scheduled to begin by year-end 2024. MCZ/DB presents a strong scientific and commercial potential for addressing rVVC.AlenuraTM: Hyloris is co-developing Alenura™ with Vaneltix. It is a first-in-class drug candidate designed to bring immediate pain relief to patients suffering from interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS). This chronic condition affects at least 6 million people in the U.S. alone.Alenura™ stands out for its innovative dual mode-of-action. It combines a new  alkalinized form of lidocaine for fast pain relief with heparin to potentially aid in the regeneration of the bladder lining. This unique approach holds promise for providing both immediate symptom relief and long-term benefits for IC/BPS patients.June 2023 marked a significant milestone with the enrollment of the first patient in the Phase 2 clinical trial of Alenura™. This pivotal study will compare the effectiveness of Alenura™ against its individual components (lidocaine and heparin) as well as a placebo.PTX-252: PTX-252 is a novel chelating agent in development for the treatment of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). This product candidate incorporates a novel molecular entity that is a derivative of a known established molecule. This advancement was followed by positive news: Hyloris' co-development partner  Pleco  secured Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA for PTX-252 specifically for AML.PTX-252's potential lies in its ability to potentially improve the effectiveness of existing chemotherapy for AML patients. This is particularly significant as AML affects approximately 160 000 people globally. Previous research suggests a correlation between high levels of toxic metals and lower survival rates in AML patients.A Pre-Investigational New Drug (PIND) meeting with the FDA is planned.Valacyclovir: A successful study demonstrating bioequivalence was completed in 2023. An additional pivotal study can be expected to start and close in H1 of 2024. Registration batches have been manufactured to demonstrate pharmaceutical quality of the product and robustness of the manufacturing process.Hyloris is developing a liquid formulation of valacyclovir which is currently only available in oral solid form. Valayclovir is an antiviral drug commonly used to treat the Herpes Simplex Viruses (HSV) that cause cold sores  genital herpes  chicken pox  and shingles.Management & Board changesThe total headcount of the Company grew to 42 people  with several key recruitments occurring over the summer. To enhance the development activities  only limited additional hiring is required. Both the C-level executives and all board members remained in their respective positions  providing continuity in the company's leadership.Business OutlookWith 18 reformulated and repurposed molecules  and 3 high-barrier generics  several clinical trials are expected to start and/or finish within 2024. The Company is actively accelerating the growth of its product pipeline  aiming to reach 30 product candidates by 2025.The company is expecting several clinical and regulatory achievements in the next 15 months. Several clinical studies will be initiated or completed. The Company is anticipating multiple NDA submissions to the U.S. FDA and other regulatory agencies.Webcast DetailsThe Company will host a webcast conducted in English to present its 2023 annual results and 2024 Business Outlook  followed by a live Q&A session.

The strong growth is mainly driven by increase of royalties of the 3 early-stage commercialized products  services provided to external partners and non-dilutive funding which we received from a US State Government and the Walloon region in Belgium.ResultsThe Company realized a net loss of €15 762 thousand in 2023  compared to a net loss of €11 770 thousand last year. The net loss is mainly resulting from the increase in R&D expenditure and G&A expenses for supporting the development of the Company. R&D expenditure during 2023 amounted to €14 749 thousand  compared to €10 272 thousand in 2022. The increase was mainly driven by the progressive shift from early to late-stage development of several product candidates as well as the increased headcount of the research and development team leading to additional costs.General and administrative expenses increased to €5 653 thousand in 2023 versus €3 517 thousand in 2022  mainly driven by higher legal costs related to the AltaThera’s litigation compared to last year.The net financial income in 2023 was €474 thousand compared to a net financial loss of €127 thousand in 2022. The positive evolution of the financial result is mainly due to the impact of an active cash management strategy in a context of high short term interest rates both in EURO and USD.As a result  net losses in 2023 increased to €15 762 thousand versus €11 770 thousand in the same period of 2022.Balance SheetThe Company’s non-current assets mainly consist of (1) investments in joint ventures of € 3 801 thousand  (2) intangible assets of €3 828 thousand including capitalized development  purchased assets and in-licensing costs  versus €3 600 thousand in 2022  (3) Right of use assets related to the leasing of the office  lab and cars  (4) shares in Pleco of €1 000 thousand  (5) a prepayment of future royalties to a third party of $700 thousand and (6) a tax credit. Hyloris does not capitalize research and development expenses until the filing for a marketing authorization for the applicable product candidate. Research and development expenditures incurred during the period were accounted for as operating expenses. When an intangible asset is acquired and capitalized  the amortization begins when the asset is available for commercialization.The Company’s current assets mainly consist of €30 196 thousand in cash and cash equivalents on total assets of €47.61 million  and trade and other receivables of €4.1 million.The increase in Right-of-use assets and borrowings is due to the start of the lease for the new lab. The Company received an advance payment related to a government grant from the Walloon region. €43 thousand of this advance is a financial liability and €37 thousand is part of Trade and other liabilities.Cash Position and cash flowThe Company maintains its strong cash position  with a current cash and cash equivalents totaled €30 196 thousand at the end of 2023  compared to €43 457 thousand at the end of 2022 (which includes a deposit for an amount of €10 million which has been reclassified to Other investment in 2022).Net cash outflow generated from operating activities was €12 726 thousand in 2023  compared to a net operating cash outflow of €12 499 thousand in 2022. The stable net operating cash outflow is attributed to an internal control system implemented to oversee expenditure and cash flow  which includes effective management of working capital.CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31ASSETS(in thousands of euros)31-Dec-2331-Dec-22 Restated*Non-current assets 12 336 11 063 Intangible assets 3 828 3 607 Property  plant and equipment 429 176 Right-of-use assets 1 724 885 Equity accounted investments 3 801 3 948 Other investment  including derivatives 1 000 1 000 Trade and other receivables 1.554 1.447 Current assets 35 276 49 801 Trade and other receivables 4 100 4 127 Other investment  including derivatives 499 10 4699 Prepayments 481 1 748 Cash and cash equivalents 30 196 33 4579 TOTAL ASSETS 47 612 60 864 EQUITY AND LIABILITIES(in thousands of euros)31-Dec-2331-Dec-22 Restated*Equity 38.822 54.045 Share capital 140 140 Share premium 121 513 121 513 Retained earnings  excluding profit (loss) for the reporting period (65 246) (53 476) Result of the period  profit (loss) for the reporting period (15 762) (11 770) Share based payment 2.161 1 621 Cost of Capital (4 460) (4 460) Other reserves 476 476 Non-current liabilities 1.853 1 047 Borrowings 1 510 747 Other financial liabilities 344 300 Current liabilities 6 937 5 772 Borrowings 241 138 Other financial liabilities 3 200 3 212 Trade and other liabilities 3 496 2 422 Current tax liabilities -

A reassessment determined that both transactions qualify as a non-monetary exchange because negotiations and valuations occurred simultaneously. Due to the development stage of the products exchanged  the fair value of neither the asset received  nor the asset given up can be reliably determined. As a result of this reassessment  the restated financials for 2022 will reverse the €1 million revenue from the divestment of HY-038. This adjustment will also affect the half-year 2023 financial statements  resulting in a reversal of €1 million in R&D expenses for HY-088. These expenses are offset against the €1 million received by Hyloris for HY-038.(See Press Release dated 14th of March 2024 on the restatement for more information)The following tables summarize the impact of the restatement on the consolidated financial statements.Consolidated statement of financial positionPer 31 December 2022(in € thousands)Impact of correction of error As previously reported Adjustment As restated Current assets 50.801 -1.000 49.801 Trade and other receivables 5.127 -1.000 4.127 Total assets 61.864 -1.000 60.864 Equity 55.045 -1.000 54.045 Result of the period (10.770) -1.000 (11.770) Total equity and liabilities 61.864 -1.000 60.864Consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive incomeFor the year ended 31 December 2022(in € thousands)Impact of correction of error As previously reported Adjustment As restated Revenues 2.951 -1.000 1.951 Gross profit 2.857 -1.000 1.857 Operating profit/(loss) (EBIT) (10.638) -1.000 (11.638) Profit (loss) before taxes (10.766) -1.000 (11.766) PROFIT (LOSS) FOR THE PERIOD (10.770) -1.000 (11.770) TOTAL COMPREHENSIVE INCOME FOR THE PERIOD (10.770) -1.000 (11.770)For the year ended 31 December 2022(in €)Impact of correction of error As previously reported Adjustment As restated Basic/diluted earnings/(loss) per share (0.380) (0.035) (0.435)Consolidated statement of cash flowsEven though there was an actual cash inflow of EUR 1 million from the out-licensing of HY-038 and a cash outflow of EUR 1.2 million resulting from the in-licensing of HY-088  the transactions are presented in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended per December 31  2023 (i.e.  EUR 200k prepaid expenses)  as this most faithfully presents the substance of the transactions.

Hyloris moved to dismiss the complaint for improper service of process and lack of jurisdiction. Further  in November 2022  Hyloris initiated an arbitration against AltaThera for breach of the same licensing agreement between Hyloris and AltaThera in relation to Sotalol IV  including the failure of AltaThera to use commercially reasonable efforts in selling Sotalol IV as required under the licensing agreement  which seeks damages and termination of the licensing agreement (the “Arbitration”). AltaThera responded and counter-demanded  reasserting its claims from the Litigation.At the end of August 2023  all parties agreed to stipulate to the dismissal of the Litigation and to consolidate the Litigation and the Arbitration before the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in New York.Hyloris contests the claims asserted by AltaThera and  based upon Hyloris’ assessment of the documents and expert reports put forward to date by AltaThera to support its claims  Hyloris is of the view that there is no convincing evidence supporting AltaThera’s claims for liability or damages. On the other hand  Hyloris believes strongly in the merits of its claims against AltaThera  and that its position is well supported by its expert reports and other documents and evidence submitted to the arbitration panel.Arbitration hearings are scheduled in April 2024 with a final decision expected by the end of H1 2024. Hyloris remains fully confident about the outcome of this litigation in its favor. Hyloris however cannot guarantee that the outcome of the litigation  even if in its favor  may not have a negative impact on future sales of Sotalol IV.About Hyloris Pharmaceuticals SAHyloris is a specialty biopharma company focused on innovating  reinventing  and optimizing existing medications to address important healthcare needs and deliver relevant improvements for patients  healthcare professionals and payors.The Company’s development strategy primarily focuses on leveraging established regulatory pathways  such as the FDA’s 505(b)2 pathway in the U.S or equivalent regulatory frameworks in other regions which are specifically designed for pharmaceuticals for which safety and efficacy of the molecule have already been established.

As a company built on the unique and successful strategy of repurposing and reformulating existing pharmaceuticals  we achieved a major milestone with the U.S. approval of Maxigesic® IV in partnership with AFT Pharmaceuticals  marking a crucial step in delivering this innovative pain management solution to American patients.Additionally  approval was secured for Podofilox gel  the first generic version of Condylox® Gel  expanding access to this medication. Our unwavering commitment to research and development yielded impressive progress across our diverse product pipeline. These advancements solidify our position as a leader in providing solutions to unmet medical needs in the years to come. We are incredibly proud of our team's dedication and resilience throughout this transformative year.Looking ahead to 2024  Hyloris is poised for continued growth and innovation. We plan to significantly bolster our pipeline with the addition of several new product candidates addressing critical unmet medical needs. Recent additions  including treatments for Vulvar Lichen Sclerosus and Burning Mouth Syndrome  demonstrate our commitment to expanding our portfolio and addressing a wider range of patient needs. We remain confident in our ability to continue delivering value to patients  shareholders  and all stakeholders and expect continued growth beyond 2024.Commercial HighlightsMaxigesic® IV is a patented  unique combination  intravenous formulation for the treatment of post-operative pain and is currently licensed to partners covering over 100 countries across the globe.During 2023 and early 2024:A marketing authorization was granted by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in October 2023.Hikma Pharmaceuticals (Hikma)  a leading supplier of complex injectable hospital products  has launched the product in the U.S. under the tradename Combogesic® IV. An exclusive license and distribution agreement had previously been signed between Hyloris’ partner AFT Pharmaceuticals (AFT) and Hikma.Additional submissions for marketing authorization were made in 13 countries in the Middle East  Africa  Latin America  and Asia.Additional marketing authorizations have been granted in 8 countries including Poland  South Africa  and Spain. In early 2024  Health Canada granted approval bringing the total number of approvals to 50.Launches occurred in 14 countries including Norway  Singapore  Belgium  The Netherlands  the Czech Republic  and Romania. Imminent launches are expected in several additional countries  bringing the total number of countries where Maxigesic® IV will be available up to more than 30.In the United States  chronic opioid usage in patients following surgery averages around 9%  ranging from 4% to 24% among various specialties. Drug overdoses involving opioids resulted in over 80.000 deaths in the U.S. in 2021. Patients who experienced an opioid overdose accounted for nearly $2 billion in annual hospital costs.Sotalol IV is a patented  intravenous formulation of Sotalol for the treatment of atrial fibrillation  and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias developed for the U.S. Sotalol IV potentially allows to significantly reduce the length of hospital stay and the overall cost of care and potentially improve patient outcomes.Hyloris is taking further steps targeting to increase product related revenues in the future (see also: Ongoing Legal Proceedings).Podofilox Gel (Product previously referenced as HY-016)In December 2023  our partner Padagis US LLC (Padagis) received marketing authorization for Podofilox gel 0.5% from the FDA. Padagis launched the product in December 2023. It is the first generic for Condylox® Gel in the U.S.Podofilox Gel is an antimycotic drug for the topical treatment of external genital and perianal warts caused by certain types of the Human Papilloma Virus (HPV). Around 1% of the sexually active population in the U.S. presents with genital or perianal warts.1 To date there is a vaccine for HPV but no cure.For the 12 months period ending December 2022  Condylox® Gel had U.S. sales of approximately $9 million according to IQVIA Health.Other Commercial HighlightsTranexamic Acid RTUAdditional out-licensing agreements were signed for Tranexamic Acid RTU in 2023. These agreements cover a large European country and several major Asian countries  with a combined population of over 60 million people. Previous agreements have been signed in 2021 for Australia  New-Zealand and Canada. In 2023  our licensing partner for Canada submitted an application for approval by Health Canada. Additional regulatory submissions in the partnered territories are in progress  and more out-licensing agreements are expected going forward. An Abbreviated New Drug Application (ANDA) has been submitted to the U.S. FDA.Tranexamic acid injection is an established antifibrinolytic agent used in emergency situations with major hemorrhages and is also used as a prophylactic agent in surgeries. Hyloris is developing a ready-to-use (RTU) formulation for infusion.Atomoxetine Oral LiquidAn out-licensing agreement was signed with Kye Pharmaceuticals (Kye) in October 2023. Kye will exclusively commercialize the product in Canada where atomoxetine is currently not available as an oral liquid formulation. The introduction of an oral liquid formulation in the ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder) medication category has historically led to significant market share gains2. This suggests a strong potential for Atomoxetine Oral Liquid in Canada  where an estimated 1.8 million people (or 4-6% of adults and 5-7% of children) are diagnosed with ADHD3. ADHD is a chronic condition  with symptoms persisting into adulthood for 60-80% of patients4.Under the terms of the agreement  Hyloris will be eligible to receive attractive sales-related milestone payments (totaling up to USD 7.5 million)  and a substantial share of the generated revenue.New Pipeline Product CandidatesOur business development team leverages its expertise in existing products  real-world data  and a vast network to identify unmet medical needs. This includes collaborating with healthcare professionals  patient groups  insurers (payors)  and industry partners. In 2023 over 87 opportunities were screened and 3 product candidates will meet our investment criteria of €7 million5 in 7 years or less.For product candidates which Hyloris intends to out-license  the strategic goal is to capture a substantial part of the net product margin realized by our commercial partners. Hyloris aims to achieve this by partnering these assets close to regulatory submission  except in countries where additional local clinical trials are required. In general  we will prioritize in-market product sales or profit-based participation over (upfront) milestone payments.We aim to increase our product portfolio to 30 assets by 2025  with a focus on accelerating pipeline growth in the near future.HY-091  a novel topical treatment candidate for Vulvar Lichen Sclerosus (VLS) was announced in January 2024. VLS is a chronic inflammatory condition affecting an estimated 3% of women  causing severe pain  itching  and discomfort  significantly impacting their quality of life. HY-091 is being developed as a convenient and user-friendly treatment specifically designed to target these VLS symptoms.Hyloris has partnered with AFT for co-development  registration  and worldwide commercialization.HY-090  a promising new treatment candidate for Burning Mouth Syndrome (BMS) was announced in December 2023.BMS is a chronic condition affecting millions  primarily postmenopausal women  causing a burning  tingling  or scalding sensation in the mouth for months at a time. While the mouth appears healthy  sufferers may also experience dry mouth or taste alterations  the exact cause of BMS remains unknown. Studies suggest that 0.7% to 5% of individuals in the U.S. might be affected6.Hyloris has partnered with AFT to co-develop and commercialize the product worldwide.HY-088 was announced in January 2023. This novel  proprietary oral formulation will be administered to patients with hypophosphatemia – a condition where the blood level of phosphorus is lower than 2.5mg/dL. Patients can develop hypophosphatemia from either a genetic abnormality (such as Cushing Syndrome or osteomalacia) or an acquired condition (like long-term use of diuretics or phosphate binders).It is estimated hypophosphatemia affects around 5% of hospitalized patients  and a subpopulation needs direct treatment during and/or after their hospital stay.Treatment protocols for patients deficient in phosphate are well-established and have proven useful in other situations of bone mineral imbalance. Oral administration is the preferred way of treating hypophosphatemia  although in most countries no approved drugs exist. Currently  physicians mostly rely on compounded drugs which have  by definition  not been submitted for regulatory scrutiny regarding safety  efficacy  and quality.R&D UpdateThroughout 2023  Hyloris achieved significant advancements across the entire R&D portfolio  propelling the 18 product candidates and 3 high-barrier generics closer to commercialization. Key milestones were met for multiple programs  and discussions with regulatory agencies and partners are underway to solidify development plans. As a result  Hyloris anticipates submitting multiple INDs (Investigational New Drug applications) and NDAs (New Drug Applications) throughout 2024 and early 2025.Enhanced Capabilities Drive EfficiencyFurther bolstering our R&D efforts  Hyloris officially opened its new and improved R&D lab at the Montlegia Science Park in June 2023. This on-site facility allows Hyloris to perform drug formulation and analytical activities in-house  streamlining processes and optimizing resource allocation for the expanding pipeline.Cardiovascular PortfolioHyloris is actively engaged in advancing a comprehensive portfolio dedicated to addressing a wide range of conditions within the largest global treatment category – cardiovascular care. These products are currently progressing through or towards clinical trials  with the aim of significantly enhancing the quality of life for patients.Main highlights for 2023 and selected expected milestones for 2024 include:Aspirin IV: Registration batches have been manufactured and the stability study is ongoing. An NDA submission is planned for the U.S. as soon as all necessary data has been collected.Aspirin IV is an intravenous (IV) formulation of acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) to be used in an emergency setting. Aspirin is not available in the U.S. as an IV product. Currently  most patients suspected of having an emergency cardiovascular event (such as a myocardial infarction or stroke) are immediately given oral aspirin to decrease their risk of morbidity and mortality.Milrinone: The optimization of the extended-release formulation for alcohol resistance marked a significant development milestone. Preparations for a pilot pharmacokinetic (PK) study are in progress.Oral milrinone is being developed as a novel  extended-release formulation offering convenient oral dosing for a selected population of end-stage heart failure (HF) patients who have Left Ventricular Assist Devices (LVADs).HY-074: All non-clinical studies were completed in 2023. A patent application was filed through the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) which allows an applicant to seek patent protection in several different countries – including the U.S. Hyloris is targeting an IND submission for Q2 2024 for the PK bridging study expected to start at the end of 2024.HY-074 is an intravenous formulation of current standard of care treatment for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) to offer faster onset of action  more convenient administration  and dosage control. It is currently available in oral form  which should allow for an optimal switching strategy from the oral form to an IV in a hospital setting.Dofetilide IV: Registration batches have been manufactured and the stability study is ongoing. A CRO has been selected for the required clinical study. An NDA submission is planned for the U.S. as soon as all necessary data has been collected.A pivotal clinical study to support regulatory submission for Dofetilide IV is nearing completion  with results expected by Q3 2024. Additional U.S. patent applications have been filed to bolster the drug's intellectual property protection.Other Value-Added ProgramsHyloris  in collaboration with its development partners  is achieving consistent progress on all stages of our value-added programs.Main highlights for 2023 and expected milestones for 2024 include:Tranexamic Acid Oral Mouth Rinse (previously HY-004): A Type A meeting with the FDA resulted in alignment on the phase 3 study protocol. The phase 3 trial began in November 2023  enrolling the first patient in early 2024. Completion of enrollment (Last Patient Last Visit - LPLV) is expected by year-end  with study results anticipated in the first half of 2025.This rinse targets patients on blood thinners (anticoagulant therapies) undergoing dental procedures with a high risk of excessive bleeding. Additionally  Hyloris intends to explore the effectiveness in a wider range of related oral surgery procedures  encompassing both patients with and without bleeding disorders who could benefit from a localized treatment to reduce blood clotting.Miconazole/Domiphen Bromide: Hyloris is co-developing Miconazole/Domiphen Bromide (MCZ/DB) with Purna Female Healthcare  a topical cream combining miconazole and domiphen bromide. This innovative treatment targets Recurrent Vulvovaginal Candidiasis (rVVC)  a chronic and often debilitating vaginal yeast infection affecting nearly 1 in 10 women throughout their lives.The Phase 2 clinical trial  completed in late 2023 (Q4)  showed promising results. The low-dose group exhibited evidence of delayed disease recurrence at day 29. These findings will be used to design the next clinical trial  scheduled to begin by year-end 2024. MCZ/DB presents a strong scientific and commercial potential for addressing rVVC.AlenuraTM: Hyloris is co-developing Alenura™ with Vaneltix. It is a first-in-class drug candidate designed to bring immediate pain relief to patients suffering from interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS). This chronic condition affects at least 6 million people in the U.S. alone.Alenura™ stands out for its innovative dual mode-of-action. It combines a new  alkalinized form of lidocaine for fast pain relief with heparin to potentially aid in the regeneration of the bladder lining. This unique approach holds promise for providing both immediate symptom relief and long-term benefits for IC/BPS patients.June 2023 marked a significant milestone with the enrollment of the first patient in the Phase 2 clinical trial of Alenura™. This pivotal study will compare the effectiveness of Alenura™ against its individual components (lidocaine and heparin) as well as a placebo.PTX-252: PTX-252 is a novel chelating agent in development for the treatment of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). This product candidate incorporates a novel molecular entity that is a derivative of a known established molecule. This advancement was followed by positive news: Hyloris' co-development partner  Pleco  secured Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA for PTX-252 specifically for AML.PTX-252's potential lies in its ability to potentially improve the effectiveness of existing chemotherapy for AML patients. This is particularly significant as AML affects approximately 160 000 people globally. Previous research suggests a correlation between high levels of toxic metals and lower survival rates in AML patients.A Pre-Investigational New Drug (PIND) meeting with the FDA is planned.Valacyclovir: A successful study demonstrating bioequivalence was completed in 2023. An additional pivotal study can be expected to start and close in H1 of 2024. Registration batches have been manufactured to demonstrate pharmaceutical quality of the product and robustness of the manufacturing process.Hyloris is developing a liquid formulation of valacyclovir which is currently only available in oral solid form. Valayclovir is an antiviral drug commonly used to treat the Herpes Simplex Viruses (HSV) that cause cold sores  genital herpes  chicken pox  and shingles.Management & Board changesThe total headcount of the Company grew to 42 people  with several key recruitments occurring over the summer. To enhance the development activities  only limited additional hiring is required. Both the C-level executives and all board members remained in their respective positions  providing continuity in the company's leadership.Business OutlookWith 18 reformulated and repurposed molecules  and 3 high-barrier generics  several clinical trials are expected to start and/or finish within 2024. The Company is actively accelerating the growth of its product pipeline  aiming to reach 30 product candidates by 2025.The company is expecting several clinical and regulatory achievements in the next 15 months. Several clinical studies will be initiated or completed.

The strong growth is mainly driven by increase of royalties of the 3 early-stage commercialized products  services provided to external partners and non-dilutive funding which we received from a US State Government and the Walloon region in Belgium.ResultsThe Company realized a net loss of €15 762 thousand in 2023  compared to a net loss of €11 770 thousand last year. The net loss is mainly resulting from the increase in R&D expenditure and G&A expenses for supporting the development of the Company. R&D expenditure during 2023 amounted to €14 749 thousand  compared to €10 272 thousand in 2022. The increase was mainly driven by the progressive shift from early to late-stage development of several product candidates as well as the increased headcount of the research and development team leading to additional costs.General and administrative expenses increased to €5 653 thousand in 2023 versus €3 517 thousand in 2022  mainly driven by higher legal costs related to the AltaThera’s litigation compared to last year.The net financial income in 2023 was €474 thousand compared to a net financial loss of €127 thousand in 2022. The positive evolution of the financial result is mainly due to the impact of an active cash management strategy in a context of high short term interest rates both in EURO and USD.As a result  net losses in 2023 increased to €15 762 thousand versus €11 770 thousand in the same period of 2022.Balance SheetThe Company’s non-current assets mainly consist of (1) investments in joint ventures of € 3 801 thousand  (2) intangible assets of €3 828 thousand including capitalized development  purchased assets and in-licensing costs  versus €3 600 thousand in 2022  (3) Right of use assets related to the leasing of the office  lab and cars  (4) shares in Pleco of €1 000 thousand  (5) a prepayment of future royalties to a third party of $700 thousand and (6) a tax credit. Hyloris does not capitalize research and development expenses until the filing for a marketing authorization for the applicable product candidate. Research and development expenditures incurred during the period were accounted for as operating expenses. When an intangible asset is acquired and capitalized  the amortization begins when the asset is available for commercialization.The Company’s current assets mainly consist of €30 196 thousand in cash and cash equivalents on total assets of €47.61 million  and trade and other receivables of €4.1 million.The increase in Right-of-use assets and borrowings is due to the start of the lease for the new lab. The Company received an advance payment related to a government grant from the Walloon region. €43 thousand of this advance is a financial liability and €37 thousand is part of Trade and other liabilities.Cash Position and cash flowThe Company maintains its strong cash position  with a current cash and cash equivalents totaled €30 196 thousand at the end of 2023  compared to €43 457 thousand at the end of 2022 (which includes a deposit for an amount of €10 million which has been reclassified to Other investment in 2022).Net cash outflow generated from operating activities was €12 726 thousand in 2023  compared to a net operating cash outflow of €12 499 thousand in 2022. The stable net operating cash outflow is attributed to an internal control system implemented to oversee expenditure and cash flow  which includes effective management of working capital.CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31ASSETS(in thousands of euros)31-Dec-2331-Dec-22 Restated*Non-current assets 12 336 11 063 Intangible assets 3 828 3 607 Property  plant and equipment 429 176 Right-of-use assets 1 724 885 Equity accounted investments 3 801 3 948 Other investment  including derivatives 1 000 1 000 Trade and other receivables 1.554 1.447 Current assets 35 276 49 801 Trade and other receivables 4 100 4 127 Other investment  including derivatives 499 10 4699 Prepayments 481 1 748 Cash and cash equivalents 30 196 33 4579 TOTAL ASSETS 47 612 60 864 EQUITY AND LIABILITIES(in thousands of euros)31-Dec-2331-Dec-22 Restated*Equity 38.822 54.045 Share capital 140 140 Share premium 121 513 121 513 Retained earnings  excluding profit (loss) for the reporting period (65 246) (53 476) Result of the period  profit (loss) for the reporting period (15 762) (11 770) Share based payment 2.161 1 621 Cost of Capital (4 460) (4 460) Other reserves 476 476 Non-current liabilities 1.853 1 047 Borrowings 1 510 747 Other financial liabilities 344 300 Current liabilities 6 937 5 772 Borrowings 241 138 Other financial liabilities 3 200 3 212 Trade and other liabilities 3 496 2 422 Current tax liabilities -

A reassessment determined that both transactions qualify as a non-monetary exchange because negotiations and valuations occurred simultaneously. Due to the development stage of the products exchanged  the fair value of neither the asset received  nor the asset given up can be reliably determined. As a result of this reassessment  the restated financials for 2022 will reverse the €1 million revenue from the divestment of HY-038. This adjustment will also affect the half-year 2023 financial statements  resulting in a reversal of €1 million in R&D expenses for HY-088. These expenses are offset against the €1 million received by Hyloris for HY-038.(See Press Release dated 14th of March 2024 on the restatement for more information)The following tables summarize the impact of the restatement on the consolidated financial statements.Consolidated statement of financial positionPer 31 December 2022(in € thousands)Impact of correction of error As previously reported Adjustment As restated Current assets 50.801 -1.000 49.801 Trade and other receivables 5.127 -1.000 4.127 Total assets 61.864 -1.000 60.864 Equity 55.045 -1.000 54.045 Result of the period (10.770) -1.000 (11.770) Total equity and liabilities 61.864 -1.000 60.864Consolidated statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive incomeFor the year ended 31 December 2022(in € thousands)Impact of correction of error As previously reported Adjustment As restated Revenues 2.951 -1.000 1.951 Gross profit 2.857 -1.000 1.857 Operating profit/(loss) (EBIT) (10.638) -1.000 (11.638) Profit (loss) before taxes (10.766) -1.000 (11.766) PROFIT (LOSS) FOR THE PERIOD (10.770) -1.000 (11.770) TOTAL COMPREHENSIVE INCOME FOR THE PERIOD (10.770) -1.000 (11.770)For the year ended 31 December 2022(in €)Impact of correction of error As previously reported Adjustment As restated Basic/diluted earnings/(loss) per share (0.380) (0.035) (0.435)Consolidated statement of cash flowsEven though there was an actual cash inflow of EUR 1 million from the out-licensing of HY-038 and a cash outflow of EUR 1.2 million resulting from the in-licensing of HY-088  the transactions are presented in the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended per December 31  2023 (i.e.  EUR 200k prepaid expenses)  as this most faithfully presents the substance of the transactions.

Hyloris moved to dismiss the complaint for improper service of process and lack of jurisdiction. Further  in November 2022  Hyloris initiated an arbitration against AltaThera for breach of the same licensing agreement between Hyloris and AltaThera in relation to Sotalol IV  including the failure of AltaThera to use commercially reasonable efforts in selling Sotalol IV as required under the licensing agreement  which seeks damages and termination of the licensing agreement (the “Arbitration”). AltaThera responded and counter-demanded  reasserting its claims from the Litigation.At the end of August 2023  all parties agreed to stipulate to the dismissal of the Litigation and to consolidate the Litigation and the Arbitration before the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) in New York.Hyloris contests the claims asserted by AltaThera and  based upon Hyloris’ assessment of the documents and expert reports put forward to date by AltaThera to support its claims  Hyloris is of the view that there is no convincing evidence supporting AltaThera’s claims for liability or damages. On the other hand  Hyloris believes strongly in the merits of its claims against AltaThera  and that its position is well supported by its expert reports and other documents and evidence submitted to the arbitration panel.Arbitration hearings are scheduled in April 2024 with a final decision expected by the end of H1 2024. Hyloris remains fully confident about the outcome of this litigation in its favor. Hyloris however cannot guarantee that the outcome of the litigation  even if in its favor  may not have a negative impact on future sales of Sotalol IV.About Hyloris Pharmaceuticals SAHyloris is a specialty biopharma company focused on innovating  reinventing  and optimizing existing medications to address important healthcare needs and deliver relevant improvements for patients  healthcare professionals and payors.The Company’s development strategy primarily focuses on leveraging established regulatory pathways  such as the FDA’s 505(b)2 pathway in the U.S or equivalent regulatory frameworks in other regions which are specifically designed for pharmaceuticals for which safety and efficacy of the molecule have already been established.

37574,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.theepochtimes.com/business/bud-light-owners-trading-suspended-after-stakeholder-announces-sale-of-35-million-shares-5607473,Bud Light Owner’s Trading Suspended After Stakeholder Announces Sale of 35 Million Shares,Bud Light Owner’s Trading Suspended After Stakeholder Announces Sale of 35 Million Sharestheepochtimes.com,AB InBev’s shares have tumbled from around $127 to roughly $61 with further downward pressure expected.Trading shares of Bud Light-owner Anheuser-Busch InBev’s (AB InBev) was suspended on Thursday amid Marlboro-maker Altria’s plans to sell millions of company shares.On Thursday  the Financial Services and Markets Authority (FSMA)  Belgium’s financial regulator  suspended the trading of AB InBev’s shares on the Euronext Brussels stock exchange for a few hours from 9:00 a.m. CET to 14:00 CET.The suspension followed a decision by major shareholder Altria announcing on Wednesday that it would sell around 35 million shares it holds in AB InBev. AB InBev shares were trading at around €58.6 (approximately $64) at the time  making the 35 million shares roughly worth $2.24 billion.After Altria announced its intention to sell shares  AB InBev agreed “to repurchase $200 million of ordinary shares directly from Altria  concurrently with  and conditional on  completion of the offering ” Altria said in a statement.As such  a temporary suspension of trading was instituted on Thursday  during which time AB InBev and Altria discussed the sale terms. AB InBev eventually agreed buy 3.33 million ordinary shares from Altria at a price of roughly $59. AB InBev said it intends to fund the direct buyback with cash on hand.After the pricing was decided  AB InBev shares opened for trade at the Euronext Brussels exchange on Thursday. The company’s shares were trading at around €56.40 (approximately $61.50) as of 15:20 p.m. CET  a decline of 3.75 percent from Wednesday.“We remain disciplined in our capital-allocation decisions and participating in this offering is consistent with our strategy ” said AB InBev CEO Michel Doukeris.“We recently completed our $1 billion share buyback that was announced in October 2023 and will participate in this offering for a further $200 million repurchase of our shares. Altria remains a significant shareholder of our company and we look forward to continuing our important shareholder relationship with them.”Altria had received 185 million shares in AB InBev back in October 2016 when African beer maker SABMiller was acquired by AB InBev. Altria had a stake in SABMiller.In addition  Altria purchased 12 million more shares the same month  taking its holdings in AB InBev to 197 million  representing roughly a 10 percent stake in the brewer.At the time  AB InBev shares were trading around the $127 level  far higher than the $61.5 it is trading currently.As Altria’s income generated from AB InBev declined  the company shifted from viewing its stake as “strategic” to a “financial investment ” said Callum Elliott  analyst at Bernstein  according to Reuters.In a note  James Edwardes Jones  an analyst at RBC Capital Markets  said he doesn’t find it surprising that Altria was scaling down its AB InBev stake. “On balance  we feel that this is likely to act as a short-term brake on ABI’s share price but is of minimal longer-term significance.” Altria Stake  Bud Light Impact After the share sale is completed  Altria will own around 8.1 percent stake in AB InBev. Altria granted underwriters of the share sale a 30-day option to buy around 5.25 million additional shares. If underwriters exercise this option  Altria’s AB InBev stake could drop further to 7.8 percent.Altria CEO Billy Gifford said the deal was an “opportunistic transaction” which banks in a portion of its investment.“Over the decades of our ownership  the beer investment has provided significant income and cash returns and supported our strong balance sheet. Our continued investment reflects ongoing confidence in ABI’s long-term strategies  premium global brands  and experienced management team.”Altria’s sale of AB InBev shares comes after the company reported depressing sales in the United States. For fiscal year 2023  AB InBev reported a 7.8 percent gain in revenue overall. However  revenues dipped by 9.5 percent in the United States  with fourth-quarter revenues crashing by 17.3 percent.AB InBev attributed the fall “primarily due to the volume decline of Bud Light.” In April last year  Bud Light partnered with transgender social media personality Dylan Mulvaney in a promotional campaign. Anheuser-Busch sent custom Bud Light beer cans to the personality featuring the trans-activist’s face  a move that was criticized as pushing the transgender agenda.As the promotional campaign went viral  criticism started to pour in and Bud Light faced boycott calls. By June  Bud Light was no longer the top-selling beer brand in the United States.Bud Light sales during the recent Super Bowl Sunday were dismal as well  indicating that Americans continue to boycott the beer almost a year after the controversy.In 2023  Bud Light was the top-selling brand during the Super Bowl  according to a report issued by hospitality engagement platform Union  cited by media outlets. During the 2024 Super Bowl  Bud Light sales dropped by 50 percent.Speaking to Fox News last month  former Anheuser-Busch executive Anson Frerick criticized the company for its handling of the Bud Light controversy.“They haven’t done a good job of climbing out of this ditch at all. You still have sales that are down 30 percent week over week  and that’s despite them last summer spending three times their planned marketing budget on Bud Light ” he said.“The biggest problem is that they’ve lost trust with their customers  and they still haven’t gone out and personally asked for their customers to come back to them … And until they restore that trust  I don’t think this brand is going to turn around and get back to growth anytime soon.”,neutral,0.02,0.77,0.21,mixed,0.12,0.31,0.56,True,English,"['Bud Light Owner', '35 Million Shares', 'Trading', 'Stakeholder', 'Sale', 'former Anheuser-Busch executive Anson Frerick', 'AB InBev CEO Michel Doukeris', 'custom Bud Light beer cans', 'hospitality engagement platform Union', 'Euronext Brussels stock exchange', 'Altria CEO Billy Gifford', 'recent Super Bowl Sunday', 'transgender social media personality', 'Euronext Brussels exchange', 'James Edwardes Jones', 'minimal longer-term significance', 'premium global brands', 'experienced management team', 'African beer maker', 'RBC Capital Markets', 'important shareholder relationship', 'Bud Light Impact', 'strong balance sheet', 'Bud Light sales', 'top-selling beer brand', '$1 billion share buyback', '5.25 million additional shares', 'AB InBev shares', 'AB InBev stake', '3.33 million ordinary shares', '2024 Super Bowl', 'Anheuser-Busch InBev', 'transgender agenda', 'top-selling brand', 'media outlets', 'AB InBev.', 'depressing sales', 'Bud Light-owner', 'beer investment', 'Markets Authority', 'direct buyback', 'major shareholder', 'significant shareholder', '35 million shares', '$200 million repurchase', '185 million shares', 'downward pressure', 'Financial Services', 'financial regulator', 'capital-allocation decisions', 'Callum Elliott', 'short-term brake', 'share sale', 'opportunistic transaction', 'ongoing confidence', 'long-term strategies', 'United States', 'fiscal year', 'Dylan Mulvaney', 'promotional campaign', 'boycott calls', 'Fox News', 'sale terms', 'financial investment', 'share price', 'continued investment', 'temporary suspension', '30-day option', 'significant income', 'cash returns', 'fourth-quarter revenues', 'volume decline', '10 percent stake', '8.1 percent stake', '7.8 percent gain', 'Trading shares', 'Marlboro-maker Altria', 'Altria Stake', 'company shares', '12 million', '3.75 percent', '9.5 percent', '17.3 percent', '50 percent', 'Thursday', 'plans', 'millions', 'FSMA', 'Belgium', 'hours', '9:00 a', 'Wednesday', 'time', 'intention', 'completion', 'offering', 'statement', 'hand', 'pricing', 'trade', 'strategy', 'October', 'SABMiller', 'holdings', 'brewer', '$127 level', 'analyst', 'Bernstein', 'Reuters', 'note', 'ABI', 'underwriters', 'deal', 'portion', 'decades', 'ownership', 'fall', 'April', 'trans-activist', 'face', 'move', 'viral', 'criticism', 'June', 'Americans', 'controversy', 'report', '14:00', '15:20']",2024-03-14,2024-03-15,theepochtimes.com
