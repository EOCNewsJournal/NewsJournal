Proposed decisionson(A) authorisation for the Board to decide on the acquisition of the Company's own shares  (B) authorisation for the Board to decide on transfer the Company's own shares and (C) transfer of the Company's own shares to participants under the LTI programme 2023(item 15) The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting decides to acquire and transfer respectively the Company's own shares in accordance with that stated below. Background The Board believes that situations may arise during the period until the next Annual General Meeting when there will be a need to repurchase shares and to transfer them. For instance  this may arise in the context of industrial acquisitions and other structural development of the operations of the Nederman Group and to enable transfer of shares to participants in Nederman's incentive programs. (A)The Board's proposal for decision to authorise the Board to decide on the acquisition of the Company's own shares The Board proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorise the Board to decide  on one or more occasions during the period until the 2025 Annual General Meeting  to acquire the Company's own shares as follows: (i) Acquisition of the Company's own shares can take place on Nasdaq Stockholm at a price within the registered share price interval at any time  the interval being defined as the range between the highest buying price and lowest selling price. (ii) Acquisition of the Company's own shares may be made so that the Company's holding of its own shares amounts to a maximum of ten (10) per cent of all shares in Nederman. (B)The Board's proposal for the authorisation for the Board to decide on transfer the Company's own shares The Board proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorises the Board to decide  on one or more occasions during the period until the 2025 Annual General Meeting  to transfer the Company's own shares as follows: (i) Transfer may be made of a maximum of the number of shares that are held by the Company at the time of the Board's decision and which are not transferred within the framework of the Company's incentive programme. (ii) Transfer of the Company's own shares can take place on Nasdaq Stockholm at a price within the registered share price interval at any time  the interval being defined as the range between the highest buying price and lowest selling price. (iii) Transfer of shares may take place as payment in full or in part of the purchase price for the acquisition of companies or business or in connection with a merger  whereby the payment shall correspond to the assessed market value. (iv) Payment for transferred shares may be made in cash  with capital contributed in kind or through set-off against the asset in the Company. (v) Transfer may be made with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights. (C) The Board's proposal for decisionontransferoftheCompany'sownsharesto participants undertheLTIprogramme According to the terms of the Company's long-term incentive program LTI 2023  which is regulated by theGuidelines for remuneration to senior executivesadopted by the Annual General Meeting and which include  for 2023  ten senior executives  the Company shall  after the Company's year-end report for 2023  pay the participants a total amount of SEK 2 187 986. The LTI payouts are subject to an undertaking by the participants to invest the net payout in Nederman shares without undue delay and to hold such shares for at least three years. Hence  the Board proposes that the Annual General Meeting decide to transfer the Company's own shares to participants in LTI 2023 as follows. A total of maximum 11 668 own shares may be transferred. The right to acquire shares shall  with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  accrue to the senior executives who participate in LTI 2023  with the right for each participant to acquire at most the number of shares corresponding to the participant's share of the total payment amount  according to the terms of LTI 2023  after a standard deduction for 50 percent preliminary tax. Transfer of shares shall take place at a price of SEK 187 53 per share  which corresponds to the volume-weighted average paid for the Company's share on Nasdaq Stockholm during ten trading days immediately after publication of the Company's year-end report for 2023. Transfer of shares shall be made as soon as possible after the 2024 Annual General Meeting. Purpose and voting majorityThe purpose of the authorisationsaccording to 15 (A) and 15 (B) and the reason for the deviation from shareholders' preferential rights is to create a readiness for the Board to fully or partially finance industrial acquisitions  including payment with the Company's own shares  and to allow other structural development of the operations of the Nederman Group. Furthermore  the purpose of the authorisation to repurchase shares is also to enable transfer of shares to participants in Nederman's incentive program.The purpose of the transfer according to item 15 (C)  and the reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential right  is to enable the Company to fulfil its commitments regarding the transfer of shares according to LTI 2023 and at the same time to facilitate for employees to fulfil their investment commitment. The transfer price corresponds to the market price per share at the time of the Company's obligation to pay the LTI compensation. The Board's proposal for resolution under items 15 (A) and (B) requires approval of shareholders representing at least two thirds of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the Annual General Meeting.

Under LTIP 2024  the participants will be granted  free of charge  (i) performance-based share awards (""Share Awards"")  and (ii) performance-based employee stock options (""Employee Stock Options"")  entitling to a maximum of 2 360 884 shares in Orexo  in accordance with the terms stipulated below. The Share Awards entitle to a maximum of 708 265 shares in Orexo and the Employee Stock Options entitle to a maximum of 1 652 619 shares in Orexo.The rationale for the proposalLTIP 2024 substantially corresponds with the performance based long-term incentive program adopted at the annual general meeting 2023 (LTIP 2023). LTIP 2024 is intended for certain senior executives and employees within the Orexo group. The board of directors of Orexo believes that an equity incentive program is an important part of a competitive remuneration package to be able to attract  retain and motivate qualified employees to the Orexo group. With reference thereto  the board of directors has decided to propose the adoption of a program corresponding to the program adopted at the annual general meeting 2023 (LTIP 2023). LTIP 2024 is based on performance-based Share Awards and Employee Stock Options and adapted to the current needs of the Orexo group.The purpose of LTIP 2024 is to attract  retain and motivate employees of the Orexo group  provide a competitive remuneration package and to align the interests of the senior executives and employees with the interests of the shareholders. The board of directors is of the opinion that this strengthens the interest for Orexo's business and also stimulates company loyalty in the future. In light of the above  the board of directors believes that the implementation of LTIP 2024 will have a positive effect on the development of the Orexo group and consequently that LTIP 2024 is beneficial to both the shareholders and the company.Conditions for Share Awards and Employee Stock OptionsThe following conditions shall apply for the Share Awards and the Employee Stock Options.- The Share Awards and the Employee Stock Options shall be granted free of charge to the participants as soon as possible following the annual general meeting 2024 and no later than on 30 June 2024. Out of the granted Share Awards and Employee Stock Options  30 percent shall constitute Share Awards and 70 percent shall constitute Employee Stock Options.- Each Share Award entitles the holder to receive one share in the company free of charge  except for the appropriate taxes  three years after the granting of the Share Award (the vesting period)  provided that the holder  with some exceptions  still is employed by the Orexo group.- Each Employee Stock Option entitles the holder to receive one share in the company upon payment of the strike price  three years after granting of the Employee Stock Option (the vesting period)  provided that the holder  with some exceptions  still is employed by the Orexo group. The strike price shall be fixed to 100 percent of the volume-weighted average price for the Orexo share during the ten trading days preceding the date of the annual general meeting 2024.- A prerequisite for entitlement to receive shares on the basis of Share Awards is that Performance Targets 1 and/or 2 have been satisfied pursuant to the terms and conditions specified below.- A prerequisite for entitlement to receive shares on the basis of Employee Stock Options is that Performance Target 1 has been satisfied pursuant to the terms and conditions specified below.- The number of Share Awards and Employee Stock Options encompassed by LTIP 2024 is to be re-calculated in the event that changes occur in Orexo's equity capital structure  such as a bonus issue  merger or consolidation of shares  new issue  reduction of the share capital or similar measures.- To make the participants' interest equal with the shareholders'  Orexo will compensate the participants for distributed dividends  if any  during the vesting period by increasing the number of shares that each Share Award and each Employee Stock Option  respectively  entitles to after the vesting period.- The Share Awards and the Employee Stock Options are non-transferable and may not be pledged.- The Share Awards and the Employee Stock Options can be granted by the parent company and any other company within the Orexo group.Performance ConditionsThe Share Awards are to be divided according to two different performance conditions encompassed by LTIP 2024. The performance conditions focus on the holder still being employed by the Orexo group (""Performance Target 1"") and Orexo's financial and operational targets for 2024 (""Performance Target 2""). Of each participant's granted Share Awards  approximately 33 percent (one third) will pertain to Performance Target 1 and up to approximately 67 percent (two thirds) will pertain to Performance Target 2.The Employee Stock Options are to be divided according to one performance condition encompassed by LTIP 2024  which is Performance Target 1. Of each participant's granted Employee Stock Options  100 percent will pertain to Performance Target 1  meaning that no Employee Stock Options will vest unless the performance target is met.The allotment of shares that each participant later may receive depends on achievement of the established performance targets as described below.Performance Target 1 (for Share Awards and Employee Stock Options) : This target pertains to the holder still being employed by the Orexo group upon vesting.Performance Target 2 (for Share Awards) : This target pertains to the fulfilment of the financial and operational targets for the financial year 2024 as established by the board of directors and relates to Orexo's key KPIs as for example revenue  profitability and achieved milestones  etc. Performance achievement of individual targets is weighted into an overall average performance achievement. The outcome will be measured lineally; meaning that from zero to 100 percent of the Share Awards will vest depending on the overall average rate of performance of the financial and operational targets. All Share Awards will vest and entitle to one share each if 100 percent of the overall average performance is achieved. When calculating the overall performance achievement  individual targets may account for a maximum of 120 percent achievement  but the overall average performance is capped at 100 percent. If performance achievement falls below 80 percent for an individual target  this individual target accounts for zero in the calculation of the overall average achieved.The board of directors will present the rate of achievement of Performance Target 2 in the annual report for 2024.AllocationThe participants are divided into two allocation categories: (i) CEO and other members of group management; (ii) other personnel. The maximum number of Share Awards and Employee Stock Options that a participant may be granted in LTIP 2024 depends on the category to which the participant belongs.To ensure that the value of the share-based remuneration does not reach an unintended level in relation to other remuneration  the value of the Share Awards and Employee Stock Options granted to the CEO and group management must not  at the time of the grant  exceed a value equal to the person's current annual base salary. For other personnel the value must not exceed 33 percent of the annual base salary.The board of directors shall resolve upon the final allocation of the Share Awards and Employee Stock Options as soon as possible after the annual general meeting. Several factors will be considered in order to secure recruitment  retention and motivation when deciding upon individual allocations including position within Orexo  individual performance and total value of current remuneration package. Individual allocation cannot exceed the above-mentioned limit for the category that the individual belongs to. Out of the allocated Share Awards and Employee Stock Options  30 percent will constitute Share Awards and 70 percent will constitute Employee Stock Options.The share price that is to form the basis for calculating the number of Share Awards and Employee Stock Options is to correspond to the average last price paid during a given period of trading. This period comprises the first ten days of trading immediately following the date of the 2024 annual general meeting. The share price is then divided by the individual granting value in order to arrive at the total number of Share Awards and Employee Stock Options granted per participant.Preparation and administrationThe board of directors shall be responsible for preparing the detailed terms and conditions of LTIP 2024  in accordance with the mentioned terms and guidelines. To this end  the board of directors shall be entitled to make adjustments to meet foreign regulations or market conditions. The board of directors may also make other adjustments if significant changes in the Orexo group  or its operating environment  would result in a situation where the decided terms and conditions for LTIP 2024 no longer are appropriate. Prior to finally determining allotment of shares on the basis of Share Awards and Employee Stock Options  the board of directors will assess whether the outcome of LTIP 2024 is reasonable. This assessment will be conducted in relation to the company's financial earnings and position  conditions in the stock market and other circumstances. Should the board of directors not consider the outcome to be reasonable  the number of shares to be allotted will be reduced.Preparation of the proposalLTIP 2024 has been initiated by the board of directors of Orexo and has been structured in consultation with external advisers based on an evaluation of prior incentive programs and best market practices. LTIP 2024 has been prepared by the remuneration committee and reviewed at meetings of the board of directors.Scope and costs of the programLTIP 2024 will be accounted for in accordance with ""IFRS 2 - Share-based payments"". IFRS 2 stipulates that the Share Awards and Employee Stock Options should be expensed as personnel costs over the vesting period and will be accounted for directly against equity. Personnel costs in accordance with IFRS 2 do not affect the company's cash flow. Social security costs will be expensed in the income statement during the vesting period.Assuming a share price at the time of implementation of SEK 15.60  that Performance Target 1 is achieved and that Performance Target 2 is achieved at 50 percent  including a share price increase of 30 percent during the vesting period  the total cost for LTIP 2024 including social security costs is estimated to approximately SEK 27.0 million before tax. The corresponding total cost with full achievement of Performance Target 1 and Performance Target 2  including a share price increase of 60 percent during the vesting period  is estimated to approximately SEK 39.2 million before tax.LTIP 2024 will have marginal effects on Orexo's key ratios since delivery of shares shall be made by way of transfer of Orexo's repurchased shares as is described under section ""Delivery under LTIP 2024"" below.Since delivery of shares under LTIP 2024 shall be made by way of transfer of Orexo's repurchased shares  LTIP 2024 entails no dilution of the shareholding of the company. The maximum level of dilution for all other outstanding long-term incentive programs in the company amounts to 0 percent  since delivery of shares shall be made by way of transfer of Orexo's repurchased shares.Information on Orexo's existing incentive programs can be found in the 2023 annual report  note 10 and 24  as well as on the company's website www.orexo.com.Delivery under LTIP 2024The board of directors proposes that delivery of shares under LTIP 2024 shall be made by way of transfer of Orexo's repurchased shares. In addition  the board of directors proposes that delivery may also be satisfied through payment of a cash amount that is equal to the value of the Orexo share on the date of vesting less the applicable strike price for any Employee Stock Options.Resolution regarding adoption of new performance-based long-term incentive program LTIP Stay-on 2024 (item 21)The board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to implement a new performance-based long-term incentive program for certain Global Management Team (""GMT"") employees and US Leadership Team (""USLT"") employees within the Orexo group (""LTIP Stay-on 2024""). LTIP Stay-on 2024 is proposed to include up to approximately 13 GMT and USLT employees within the Orexo group.LTIP Stay-on 2024 is a three-year performance-based program. Under LTIP Stay-on 2024  the participants will be granted  free of charge  (i) performance-based share awards (""Share Awards"")  and (ii) performance-based employee stock options (""Employee Stock Options"")  entitling to a maximum of 70 000 shares in Orexo  in accordance with the terms stipulated below. The Share Awards entitle to a maximum of 35 000 shares in Orexo and the Employee Stock Options entitle to a maximum of 35 000 shares in Orexo.The rationale for the proposalLTIP Stay-on 2024 substantially corresponds with the performance based long-term incentive program adopted at the annual general meeting 2023 (LTIP Stay-on 2023). LTIP Stay-on 2024 is intended for certain GMT and USLT employees within the Orexo group and qualification for participation in LTIP Stay-on 2024 is conditional upon the participant either keeping shares from allocations in Orexo's other on-going long-term incentive programs (the ""implemented LTIPs"") or investing in new Orexo shares with part of or the entire annual cash bonus of the participant. The board of directors of Orexo believes that an equity incentive program is an important part of a competitive remuneration package to be able to attract  retain and motivate qualified employees to the Orexo group. The board of directors further believes that LTIP Stay-on 2024 constitutes an important incentive for GMT and USLT employees to keep shares in the company. With reference thereto  the board of directors has decided to propose the adoption of a program corresponding to the program adopted at the annual general meeting 2023 (LTIP Stay-on 2023).

However  such issue of shares must never result in the company's issued share capital or the number of shares in the company at any time  being increased by more than a total of 20 per cent. The purpose of the authorization is to enable the board to make corporate acquisitions  product acquisitions or to enter into collaboration agreements  or to raise working capital or broaden the shareholder base.The CEO shall be authorized to make such minor adjustments to this resolution that may be necessary in connection with the registration thereof.Resolution regarding authorization for the board of directors to resolve to repurchase and transfer own shares (item 19)The board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting authorizes the board of directors to resolve to repurchase  on one or several occasions until the next annual general meeting  as many own shares as may be purchased without the company's holding at any time exceeding 10 per cent of the total number of shares in the company. The shares shall be purchased on Nasdaq Stockholm and only at a price per share within the price range applicable  i.e. the range between the highest purchase price and the lowest selling price.The board of directors also proposes that the annual general meeting authorizes the board of directors to resolve  on one or several occasions until the next annual general meeting  to transfer (sell) own shares. Transfers may be carried out on Nasdaq Stockholm at a price within the price range applicable  i.e. the range between the highest purchase price and the lowest selling price. Transfers may also be made in other ways  with or without preferential rights for the shareholders  against cash payment or against payment through set-off or in kind  or otherwise on special conditions. Upon such transfers  the price shall be established so that it is not below market terms. However  a discount to the stock market price may apply  in line with market practice. Transfers of own shares may be made of up to such number of shares as is held by the company at the time of the board of director's resolution regarding the transfer.The purpose of the authorization to repurchase own shares is to promote efficient capital usage in the company  to provide flexibility as regards the company's possibilities to distribute capital to its shareholders and for use in the context of the company's incentive plans. The purpose of the authorization to transfer own shares is to enable the board to make corporate acquisitions  product acquisitions or enter into collaboration agreements  or to raise working capital or broaden the shareholder base or for use in the context of the company's incentive plans.The board of director's statement in accordance with chapter 19 section 22 of the Swedish Companies Act is made available together with the proposal.The CEO shall be authorized to make such minor adjustments to this resolution that may be necessary in connection with the registration thereof.Resolution regarding adoption of new performance-based long-term incentive program LTIP 2024 (item 20)The board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to implement a new performance-based long-term incentive program for not more than 130 selected employees within the Orexo group ("" LTIP 2024 "").LTIP 2024 is a three-year performance-based program. Under LTIP 2024  the participants will be granted  free of charge  (i) performance-based share awards ("" Share Awards "")  and (ii) performance-based employee stock options ("" Employee Stock Options "")  entitling to a maximum of 2 360 884 shares in Orexo  in accordance with the terms stipulated below. The Share Awards entitle to a maximum of 708 265 shares in Orexo and the Employee Stock Options entitle to a maximum of 1 652 619 shares in Orexo.The rationale for the proposalLTIP 2024 substantially corresponds with the performance based long-term incentive program adopted at the annual general meeting 2023 (LTIP 2023). LTIP 2024 is intended for certain senior executives and employees within the Orexo group. The board of directors of Orexo believes that an equity incentive program is an important part of a competitive remuneration package to be able to attract  retain and motivate qualified employees to the Orexo group. With reference thereto  the board of directors has decided to propose the adoption of a program corresponding to the program adopted at the annual general meeting 2023 (LTIP 2023). LTIP 2024 is based on performance-based Share Awards and Employee Stock Options and adapted to the current needs of the Orexo group.The purpose of LTIP 2024 is to attract  retain and motivate employees of the Orexo group  provide a competitive remuneration package and to align the interests of the senior executives and employees with the interests of the shareholders. The board of directors is of the opinion that this strengthens the interest for Orexo's business and also stimulates company loyalty in the future. In light of the above  the board of directors believes that the implementation of LTIP 2024 will have a positive effect on the development of the Orexo group and consequently that LTIP 2024 is beneficial to both the shareholders and the company.Conditions for Share Awards and Employee Stock OptionsThe following conditions shall apply for the Share Awards and the Employee Stock Options.- The Share Awards and the Employee Stock Options shall be granted free of charge to the participants as soon as possible following the annual general meeting 2024 and no later than on 30 June 2024 . Out of the granted Share Awards and Employee Stock Options  30 percent shall constitute Share Awards and 70 percent shall constitute Employee Stock Options.- Each Share Award entitles the holder to receive one share in the company free of charge  except for the appropriate taxes  three years after the granting of the Share Award (the vesting period)  provided that the holder  with some exceptions  still is employed by the Orexo group.- Each Employee Stock Option entitles the holder to receive one share in the company upon payment of the strike price  three years after granting of the Employee Stock Option (the vesting period)  provided that the holder  with some exceptions  still is employed by the Orexo group. The strike price shall be fixed to 100 percent of the volume-weighted average price for the Orexo share during the ten trading days preceding the date of the annual general meeting 2024.- A prerequisite for entitlement to receive shares on the basis of Share Awards is that Performance Targets 1 and/or 2 have been satisfied pursuant to the terms and conditions specified below.- A prerequisite for entitlement to receive shares on the basis of Employee Stock Options is that Performance Target 1 has been satisfied pursuant to the terms and conditions specified below.- The number of Share Awards and Employee Stock Options encompassed by LTIP 2024 is to be re-calculated in the event that changes occur in Orexo's equity capital structure  such as a bonus issue  merger or consolidation of shares  new issue  reduction of the share capital or similar measures.- To make the participants' interest equal with the shareholders'  Orexo will compensate the participants for distributed dividends  if any  during the vesting period by increasing the number of shares that each Share Award and each Employee Stock Option  respectively  entitles to after the vesting period.- The Share Awards and the Employee Stock Options are non-transferable and may not be pledged.- The Share Awards and the Employee Stock Options can be granted by the parent company and any other company within the Orexo group.Performance ConditionsThe Share Awards are to be divided according to two different performance conditions encompassed by LTIP 2024. The performance conditions focus on the holder still being employed by the Orexo group ("" Performance Target 1 "") and Orexo's financial and operational targets for 2024 ("" Performance Target 2 ""). Of each participant's granted Share Awards  approximately 33 percent (one third) will pertain to Performance Target 1 and up to approximately 67 percent (two thirds) will pertain to Performance Target 2.The Employee Stock Options are to be divided according to one performance condition encompassed by LTIP 2024  which is Performance Target 1. Of each participant's granted Employee Stock Options  100 percent will pertain to Performance Target 1  meaning that no Employee Stock Options will vest unless the performance target is met.The allotment of shares that each participant later may receive depends on achievement of the established performance targets as described below.Performance Target 1 (for Share Awards and Employee Stock Options) : This target pertains to the holder still being employed by the Orexo group upon vesting.Performance Target 2 (for Share Awards) : This target pertains to the fulfilment of the financial and operational targets for the financial year 2024 as established by the board of directors and relates to Orexo's key KPIs as for example revenue  profitability and achieved milestones  etc. Performance achievement of individual targets is weighted into an overall average performance achievement. The outcome will be measured lineally; meaning that from zero to 100 percent of the Share Awards will vest depending on the overall average rate of performance of the financial and operational targets. All Share Awards will vest and entitle to one share each if 100 percent of the overall average performance is achieved. When calculating the overall performance achievement  individual targets may account for a maximum of 120 percent achievement  but the overall average performance is capped at 100 percent. If performance achievement falls below 80 percent for an individual target  this individual target accounts for zero in the calculation of the overall average achieved.The board of directors will present the rate of achievement of Performance Target 2 in the annual report for 2024.AllocationThe participants are divided into two allocation categories: (i) CEO and other members of group management; (ii) other personnel. The maximum number of Share Awards and Employee Stock Options that a participant may be granted in LTIP 2024 depends on the category to which the participant belongs.To ensure that the value of the share-based remuneration does not reach an unintended level in relation to other remuneration  the value of the Share Awards and Employee Stock Options granted to the CEO and group management must not  at the time of the grant  exceed a value equal to the person's current annual base salary. For other personnel the value must not exceed 33 percent of the annual base salary.The board of directors shall resolve upon the final allocation of the Share Awards and Employee Stock Options as soon as possible after the annual general meeting. Several factors will be considered in order to secure recruitment  retention and motivation when deciding upon individual allocations including position within Orexo  individual performance and total value of current remuneration package. Individual allocation cannot exceed the above-mentioned limit for the category that the individual belongs to. Out of the allocated Share Awards and Employee Stock Options  30 percent will constitute Share Awards and 70 percent will constitute Employee Stock Options.The share price that is to form the basis for calculating the number of Share Awards and Employee Stock Options is to correspond to the average last price paid during a given period of trading. This period comprises the first ten days of trading immediately following the date of the 2024 annual general meeting. The share price is then divided by the individual granting value in order to arrive at the total number of Share Awards and Employee Stock Options granted per participant.Preparation and administrationThe board of directors shall be responsible for preparing the detailed terms and conditions of LTIP 2024  in accordance with the mentioned terms and guidelines. To this end  the board of directors shall be entitled to make adjustments to meet foreign regulations or market conditions. The board of directors may also make other adjustments if significant changes in the Orexo group  or its operating environment  would result in a situation where the decided terms and conditions for LTIP 2024 no longer are appropriate. Prior to finally determining allotment of shares on the basis of Share Awards and Employee Stock Options  the board of directors will assess whether the outcome of LTIP 2024 is reasonable. This assessment will be conducted in relation to the company's financial earnings and position  conditions in the stock market and other circumstances. Should the board of directors not consider the outcome to be reasonable  the number of shares to be allotted will be reduced.Preparation of the proposalLTIP 2024 has been initiated by the board of directors of Orexo and has been structured in consultation with external advisers based on an evaluation of prior incentive programs and best market practices. LTIP 2024 has been prepared by the remuneration committee and reviewed at meetings of the board of directors.Scope and costs of the programLTIP 2024 will be accounted for in accordance with ""IFRS 2 - Share-based payments"". IFRS 2 stipulates that the Share Awards and Employee Stock Options should be expensed as personnel costs over the vesting period and will be accounted for directly against equity. Personnel costs in accordance with IFRS 2 do not affect the company's cash flow. Social security costs will be expensed in the income statement during the vesting period.Assuming a share price at the time of implementation of SEK 15.60   that Performance Target 1 is achieved and that Performance Target 2 is achieved at 50 percent  including a share price increase of 30 percent during the vesting period  the total cost for LTIP 2024 including social security costs is estimated to approximately SEK 27.0 million before tax. The corresponding total cost with full achievement of Performance Target 1 and Performance Target 2  including a share price increase of 60 percent during the vesting period  is estimated to approximately SEK 39.2 million before tax.LTIP 2024 will have marginal effects on Orexo's key ratios since delivery of shares shall be made by way of transfer of Orexo's repurchased shares as is described under section ""Delivery under LTIP 2024"" below.Since delivery of shares under LTIP 2024 shall be made by way of transfer of Orexo's repurchased shares  LTIP 2024 entails no dilution of the shareholding of the company. The maximum level of dilution for all other outstanding long-term incentive programs in the company amounts to 0 percent  since delivery of shares shall be made by way of transfer of Orexo's repurchased shares.Information on Orexo's existing incentive programs can be found in the 2023 annual report  note 10 and 24  as well as on the company's website www.orexo.com .Delivery under LTIP 2024The board of directors proposes that delivery of shares under LTIP 2024 shall be made by way of transfer of Orexo's repurchased shares. In addition  the board of directors proposes that delivery may also be satisfied through payment of a cash amount that is equal to the value of the Orexo share on the date of vesting less the applicable strike price for any Employee Stock Options.Resolution regarding adoption of new performance-based long-term incentive program LTIP Stay-on 2024 (item 21)The board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to implement a new performance-based long-term incentive program for certain Global Management Team ("" GMT "") employees and US Leadership Team ("" USLT "") employees within the Orexo group ("" LTIP Stay-on 2024 ""). LTIP Stay-on 2024 is proposed to include up to approximately 13 GMT and USLT employees within the Orexo group.LTIP Stay-on 2024 is a three-year performance-based program. Under LTIP Stay-on 2024  the participants will be granted  free of charge  (i) performance-based share awards ("" Share Awards "")  and (ii) performance-based employee stock options ("" Employee Stock Options "")  entitling to a maximum of 70 000 shares in Orexo  in accordance with the terms stipulated below. The Share Awards entitle to a maximum of 35 000 shares in Orexo and the Employee Stock Options entitle to a maximum of 35 000 shares in Orexo.The rationale for the proposalLTIP Stay-on 2024 substantially corresponds with the performance based long-term incentive program adopted at the annual general meeting 2023 (LTIP Stay-on 2023). LTIP Stay-on 2024 is intended for certain GMT and USLT employees within the Orexo group and qualification for participation in LTIP Stay-on 2024 is conditional upon the participant either keeping shares from allocations in Orexo's other on-going long-term incentive programs (the "" implemented LTIPs "") or investing in new Orexo shares with part of or the entire annual cash bonus of the participant. The board of directors of Orexo believes that an equity incentive program is an important part of a competitive remuneration package to be able to attract  retain and motivate qualified employees to the Orexo group. The board of directors further believes that LTIP Stay-on 2024 constitutes an important incentive for GMT and USLT employees to keep shares in the company. With reference thereto  the board of directors has decided to propose the adoption of a program corresponding to the program adopted at the annual general meeting 2023 (LTIP Stay-on 2023). LTIP Stay-on 2024 is based on performance-based Share Awards and Employee Stock Options and adapted to the current needs of the Orexo group.The purpose of LTIP Stay-on 2024 is to attract  retain and motivate employees of the Orexo group  provide a competitive remuneration package and to align the interests of GMT and USLT employees with the interests of the shareholders.

In light of the above  the board of directors believes that the implementation of LTIP Stay-on 2024 will have a positive effect on the development of the Orexo group and consequently that LTIP Stay-on 2024 is beneficial to both the shareholders and the company.Conditions for Share Awards and Employee Stock OptionsThe following conditions shall apply for the Share Awards and the Employee Stock Options.- Qualification for participation in LTIP Stay-on 2024 is conditional upon the participant (i) keeping shares from allocations in any of Orexo's implemented LTIPs between 1 May 2024 and 31 July 2024 ("" Opt-in 1 "")  or (ii) investing in new Orexo shares with part of or the entire annual cash bonus of the participant between 1 February 2025 and 30 April 2025 ("" Opt-in 2 "").- Under Opt-in 1  the Share Awards and the Employee Stock Options shall be granted free of charge to the participants as soon as possible after 31 July 2024 and no later than on 31 August 2024 .- Under Opt-in 2  the Share Awards and the Employee Stock Options shall be granted free of charge to the participants as soon as possible after 30 April 2025 and no later than on 31 May 2025 .- Out of the granted Share Awards and Employee Stock Options  50 percent shall constitute Share Awards and 50 percent shall constitute Employee Stock Options. Every five (5) shares kept in accordance with Opt-in 1 and every five (5) shares acquired in accordance with Opt-in 2  respectively  entitle the participant to one (1) Share Award and one (1) Employee Stock Option.- Each Share Award entitles the holder to receive one share in the company  free of charge  except for the appropriate taxes  three years after the granting of the Share Award (the vesting period)  provided that the holder  with some exceptions  still is employed by the Orexo group.- Each Employee Stock Option entitles the holder to receive one share in the company upon payment of the strike price  three years after the granting of the Employee Stock Option (the vesting period)  provided that the holder  with some exceptions  still is employed by the Orexo group. The strike price shall be fixed to 100 percent of the volume-weighted average price for the Orexo share during the ten trading days preceding the date of the annual general meeting 2024.- A prerequisite for entitlement to receive shares on the basis of Share Awards is that Performance Targets 1 and/or 2 have been satisfied pursuant to the terms and conditions specified below.- A prerequisite for entitlement to receive shares on the basis of Employee Stock Options is that Performance Target 1 has been satisfied pursuant to the terms and conditions specified below.- The number of Share Awards and Employee Stock Options encompassed by LTIP Stay-on 2024 is to be re-calculated in the event that changes occur in Orexo's equity capital structure  such as a bonus issue  merger or consolidation of shares  new issue  reduction of the share capital or similar measures.- To make the participants' interest equal with the shareholders'  Orexo will compensate the participants for distributed dividends  if any  during the vesting period by increasing the number of shares that each Share Award and each Employee Stock Option  respectively  entitles to after the vesting period.- The Share Awards and the Employee Stock Options are non-transferable and may not be pledged.- The Share Awards and the Employee Stock Options can be granted by the parent company and any other company within the Orexo group.Performance ConditionsThe Share Awards are to be divided according to two different performance conditions encompassed by LTIP Stay-on 2024. The performance conditions focus on the holder still being employed by the Orexo group ("" Performance Target 1 "") and Orexo's financial and operational targets for 2024 ("" Performance Target 2 ""). Of each participant's granted Share Awards  50 percent will pertain to Performance Target 1 and up to 50 percent will pertain to Performance Target 2.The Employee Stock Options are to be divided according to one performance condition encompassed by LTIP Stay-on 2024  which is Performance Target 1. Of each participant's granted Employee Stock Options  100 percent will pertain to Performance Target 1  meaning that no Employee Stock Options will vest unless the performance target is met.The allotment of shares that each participant later may receive depends on achievement of the established performance targets as described below.Performance Target 1 (for Share Awards and Employee Stock Options) : This target pertains to the holder still being employed by the Orexo group upon vesting.Performance Target 2 (for Share Awards) : This target pertains to the fulfilment of the financial and operational targets for the financial year 2024 as established by the board of directors and relates to Orexo's key KPIs as for example revenue  profitability and achieved milestones  etc. Performance achievement of individual targets is weighted into an overall average performance achievement. The outcome will be measured lineally; meaning that from zero to 100 percent of the Share Awards will vest depending on the overall average rate of performance of the financial and operational targets. All Share Awards will vest and entitle to one share each if 100 percent of the overall average performance is achieved. When calculating the overall performance achievement  individual targets may account for a maximum of 120 percent achievement  but the overall average performance is capped at 100 percent. If performance achievement falls below 80 percent for an individual target  this individual target accounts for zero in the calculation of the overall average achieved.The board of directors will present the rate of achievement of Performance Target 2 in the Annual Report for 2024.AllocationEvery five (5) shares kept in accordance with Opt-in 1 and every five (5) shares acquired in accordance with Opt-in 2  respectively  entitle the participants of LTIP Stay-on 2024 to one (1) Share Award and one (1) Employee Stock Option. Out of the allocated Share Awards and Employee Stock Options  50 percent will constitute Share Awards and 50 percent will constitute Employee Stock Options.In relation to allocation under Opt-in 1  the board of directors shall resolve upon the final allocation of the Share Awards and Employee Stock Options as soon as possible after 31 July 2024 . In relation to allocation under Opt-in 2  the board of directors shall resolve upon the final allocation of the Share Awards and Employee Stock Options as soon as possible after 30 April 2025 .Preparation and administrationThe board of directors shall be responsible for preparing the detailed terms and conditions of LTIP Stay-on 2024  in accordance with the mentioned terms and guidelines. To this end  the board of directors shall be entitled to make adjustments to meet foreign regulations or market conditions. The board of directors may also make other adjustments if significant changes in the Orexo group  or its operating environment  would result in a situation where the decided terms and conditions for LTIP Stay-on 2024 no longer are appropriate. Prior to finally determining allotment of shares on the basis of Share Awards and Employee Stock Options  the board of directors will assess whether the outcome of LTIP Stay-on 2024 is reasonable. This assessment will be conducted in relation to the company's financial earnings and position  conditions in the stock market and other circumstances. Should the board of directors not consider the outcome to be reasonable  the number of shares to be allotted will be reduced.Preparation of the proposalLTIP Stay-on 2024 has been initiated by the board of directors of Orexo and has been structured in consultation with external advisers based on an evaluation of prior incentive programs and best market practices. LTIP Stay-on 2024 has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee and reviewed at meetings of the board of directors.Scope and costs of the programLTIP Stay-on 2024 will be accounted for in accordance with ""IFRS 2 - Share-based payments"". IFRS 2 stipulates that the Share Awards and Employee Stock Options should be expensed as personnel costs over the vesting period and will be accounted for directly against equity. Personnel costs in accordance with IFRS 2 do not affect the company's cash flow. Social security costs will be expensed in the income statement during the vesting period.Assuming a share price at the time of implementation of SEK 15.60   that Performance Target 1 is achieved and that Performance Target 2 is achieved at 50 percent  including a share price increase of 30 percent during the vesting period  the total cost for LTIP Stay-on 2024 including social security costs is estimated to approximately SEK 0.9 million before tax. The corresponding total cost with full achievement of Performance Target 1 and Performance Target 2  including a share price increase of 60 percent during the vesting period  is estimated to approximately SEK 1.2 million before tax.LTIP Stay-on 2024 will have marginal effects on Orexo's key ratios since delivery of shares shall be made by way of transfer of Orexo's repurchased shares as is described under section ""Delivery under LTIP Stay-on 2024"" below.Since delivery of shares under LTIP Stay-on 2024 shall be made by way of transfer of Orexo's repurchased shares  LTIP Stay-on 2024 entails no dilution of the shareholding of the company. The maximum level of dilution for all other outstanding long-term incentive programs in the company amounts to 0 percent  since delivery of shares shall be made by way of transfer of Orexo's repurchased shares.Information on Orexo's existing incentive programs can be found in the 2023 annual report  note 10 and 24  as well as on the company's website www.orexo.com .Delivery under LTIP Stay-on 2024The board of directors proposes that delivery of shares under LTIP Stay-on 2024 shall be made by way of transfer of Orexo's repurchased shares. In addition  the board of directors proposes that delivery may also be satisfied through payment of a cash amount that is equal to the value of the Orexo share on the date of vesting less the applicable strike price for any Employee Stock Options.________________________A resolution in accordance with the board of directors' proposal in item 18 shall only be valid where supported by not less than two-thirds of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the meeting and resolutions in accordance with the board of directors' proposal in items 19  20 and 21 shall only be valid where supported by not less than nine-tenths of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the meeting.The shareholders are reminded of their right to request information in accordance with Chapter 7 Section 32 of the Swedish Companies Act.

Resolution regarding incentive program (“LTI I 2024”) Background and reasonsThe Company has previously implemented long term incentive programs for the years of 2021  2022 and 2023. In view of this  the majority shareholders propose that the Annual General Meeting resolves to implement a long-term incentive program for the board members in the Company (“LTI I 2024”). The proposal to implement an incentive program has been put forward as the majority shareholders determines that it is important and in the interest of all shareholders to create even greater participation for current and future board members in the Company with regard to the group’s development. It is also important to encourage continued commitment.In the light of the above  the majority shareholders propose that the Annual General Meeting resolves to implement the incentive program LTI I 2024 in accordance with item (a)–(b) below. The resolutions under item (a)–(b) below are proposed to be conditional upon each other and for that reason it is proposed that all resolutions are to be passed as one resolution. LTI I 2024 is proposed to include up to 8 current and future board members of the Company.Proposal regarding the adoption of LTI I 2024 (item 15 (a))LTI I 2024 is comprised of restricted stock units (“RSU”) which will be granted to current and future board members of the Company pursuant to the Olink Holding AB (publ) Amended and Restated 2021 Incentive Award Plan (the “Plan”)  as amended  and an award agreement thereunder to be entered into between the Company and each recipient evidencing each such grant and terms under the Plan. On 14 March 2024  the Board adopted  subject to the approval of the Company’s shareholders  an amendment to the Plan  which will become effective on the date of its approval by the Company’s shareholders  which will occur upon approval by the Company’s shareholders of LTI I 2024 and LTI II 2024 as described herein. The purpose of the amendment to the Plan is to increase the maximum number of shares available for issuance under the Plan in order to ensure that there is a sufficient number of shares available for grant pursuant to LTI I 2024 and LTI II 2024 as described herein.The majority shareholders propose that the general meeting resolves to issue not more than 70 000 warrants of series I 2024 in order to secure delivery of either shares  warrants of series I 2024 or American depository shares in the Company (“ADS”) upon exercise of RUSs to participants in LTI I 2024. The right to subscribe for the warrants of series I 2024 shall vest in the Company. The Company shall keep warrants of series I 2024 to ensure delivery of shares  warrants of series I 2024 or ADS upon exercise of RSUs in LTI I 2024. Each warrant of series I 2024 entitles the holder to subscribe for one (1) share in the Company. The warrants of series I 2024 shall be issued without consideration to the Company.Below is a description of the terms and conditions for the LTI I 2024. A copy of the Plan can be found at https://investors.olink.com/annual-general-meeting and shareholders are advised to review the actual terms of the Plan.LTII2024–Restrictedstockunits(withwarrantsashedgingarrangement)Within the scope of LTI I 2024  the Company may grant participants RSUs  entailing the right to  subject to certain conditions being met  receive either a share  warrant of series II 2024 or an ADS free of charge or to an exercise price equal to the quota value of the Company´s share  at the time of exercise of the RSU.RSUs may be granted to current and future board members of the Company;The RSUs will be granted without consideration no later than the day before the next Annual General Meeting;The RSUs granted will be subject to time-based vesting requirements – on the date when a portion of the options would vest as a result of the passage of time with the participant remaining board member of the Olink group;The RSUs will vest and become exercisable in equal installments on 7 April 2025  7 April 2026  7 April 2027 and 7 April 2028 provided the participant remain a board member of the Olink group at the applicable vesting dates. As a main rule each vesting period shall be twelve (12) months. All granted RSUs will  as a general rule  have vested (if applicable) on 7 April 2028  i.e  a vesting period of four (4) years. In the event that the period between the grant date and the first vesting date is less than ten (10) months for any participant  the Board is entitled to decide on a separate vesting schedule for the participant with conditions substantially equivalent to those set out in this proposed resolution;The RSUs may not be transferred or pledged; andThe terms and conditions for participants in LTI I 2024 granted RSUs may differ between countries due to differences in local legislation  however the terms and conditions shall not be more favorable for participants than what is set out in this resolution proposal.The warrants issued to the Company in order to secure delivery of shares  warrants of series I 2024 or ADS upon settlement of RSUs granted to participants in LTI I 2024 may be exercised for subscription of shares during the period from and during the period commencing on the date of the registration of the issue resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office up to and including the date ten (10) years after the registration of the issue resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office  at an exercise price equal to the shares’ quota value  at the time of exercise.Allocation of RSUs  limitations in the disposition over RSUs and the right to receive RSUsThe right to receive RSUs of LTI I 2024 shall vest in current and future board members of the Company. In total  a maximum of 70 000 RSUs may be granted to participants  of which a maximum of 10 000 RSUs may be granted to each participant.Proposal regarding issue of warrants of series I 2024 (item 15 (b))The majority shareholders proposes that the Company shall issue not more than 70 000 warrants of series I 2024 for subscription of shares  whereby the Company’s share capital may be increased bynot more than SEK 170 233.46 at full exercise of warrants for subscription of shares  corresponding to approximately 0.06 per cent of the total number of shares and votes in the Company.The right to subscribe for the warrants of series I 2024 shall  with deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights  only belong to the Company  with the right and obligation to dispose of the warrants of series I 2024 as described above. The subscription for warrants shall be made up to and including 15 May 2024. Each warrant of series I 2024 entitles the holder to subscribe for one (1) share in the Company. The warrants of series I 2024 shall be issued without compensation to the Company.The warrants may be exercised for subscription of shares during the period from and during the period commencing on the date of the registration of the issue resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office up to and including the date ten (10) years after the registration of the issue resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office  at an exercise price equal to the shares’ quota value  at the time of exercise.In order to fulfil the commitments arising from LTI I 2024  the majority shareholders proposes that the general meeting authorizes that the Company may assign to a third party or in another way dispose of the warrants of series I 2024 in accordance with above.A detailed resolution proposal for the issue of warrants of series I 2024  including complete terms and conditions for the warrants  is set out in Appendix A (including its sub-appendix).Recalculation due to split  consolidation  new share issue etc.The exercise price for warrants in LTI I 2024  determined as set out above  shall be rounded to the nearest SEK 0.10 whereby SEK 0.05 shall be rounded upwards. The exercise price and/or the number of shares that each warrant entitles to subscription for may be recalculated in the event of a split or reverse split of shares in accordance with customary re-calculation terms.CostsThe RSUs are expected to incur accounting costs (accounted for in accordance with the accounting standard IFRS 2) as well as social security costs during the term of the RSUs. According to IFRS 2  the RSUs costs shall be recorded as a personnel expense in the income statement during the vesting period. The total costs for 70 000 RSUs  calculated in accordance with IFRS 2  are estimated to amount to approximately SEK 16.2 million during the term of the program (excluding social security costs). The estimated costs have been calculated based on  inter alia  the following assumptions: (i) a market price of the Company’s share/ADS of USD 22.53  equivalent to SEK 232.03  at the time of grant  based on a USD-SEK exchange rate of 10.2989  (ii) that the maximum number of RSUs encompassed by this resolution proposal are granted to participants  (iii) that all granted RSUs will vest and (iv) that holders of RSUs receive a share  ADS or warrant of series LTI I 2024. Social security costs  which are expected to arise primarily in connection with holders of RSUs receive a share  ADS or warrant of series LTI I 2024  are estimated to amount to approximately SEK 4.3 million during the term of the program  based on inter alia the assumptions set out under items (i)–(iv) above as well as an average social security rate of 23 per cent and an increase in the market price of the Company’s share/ADS to USD 26.0.Other costs related to the LTI I 2024  including inter alia expenses related to fees to external advisors  external appraiser and administration of the incentive program  are estimated to amount to approximately SEK 0.5 million during the term of the program.Based on the assumptions set out above  the total costs of the LTI I 2024 are estimated to approximately SEK 21.1 million in total during the term of the program. These costs shall be seen in relation to the total employee benefits expenses of the Olink group  which during the financial year 2023 amounted to SEK 957 million.Motivation in respect of vesting and exercise conditionsAccording to recommendations laid down by the Swedish Corporate Governance Board (Sw. Kollegiet för svensk bolagsstyrning)  the vesting period  or the period between the date of grant until the date when a warrant or stock option may be exercised  shall as a general rule not be shorter than three (3) years. As set out further above  RSUs will vest and settled in equal installments on 7 April for four years (provided that all applicable vesting conditions have then been fulfilled). The reason for applying such terms  which are not in line with the recommendations of the Swedish Corporate Governance Board as set out above  is that the majority shareholders deem such terms to be in line with market practice for programs in most of the countries where the intended participants in the LTI I 2024 are operative. It is therefore  in the opinion of the majority shareholders of the Company  in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders to apply such terms in order to fulfil the objectives of the LTI I 2024.DilutionUpon exercise of all warrants of series I 2024 issued within the frame of LTI I 2024 for subscription of shares  up to 70 000 shares (with reservation for any re-calculation) may be issued  equivalent to a maximum dilution of approximately 0.06 per cent of the shares and votes of the Company. Upon full exercise of warrants of series I 2024 for subscription of shares  the Company’s share capital will increase with SEK 170 233.46. The dilution calculations have been based on the maximum number of shares and votes which may be issued upon exercise of RSUs  divided by the total number of outstanding shares and votes in the Company as per 20 February 2024 after such issues.Preparation of the proposalThe proposal to the incentive program LTI I 2024 has been prepared by the majority shareholders together with external advisers. No participant of LTI I 2024 has participated in the preparation of this proposal.The reason for the deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rightsThe reason for the deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights is to implement an incentive program for the Board of Directors in the Company.Majority requirementA resolution to approve the present proposal is valid only where supported by shareholders holding not less than nine-tenths (9/10) of both the shares voted for and of the shares represented at the general meeting.AuthorizationIt is further proposed that the Board of Directors  or a person appointed by the Board of Directors  is authorized to undertake such minor adjustments in the decision that may be required for the registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and Euroclear Sweden AB and that the Board of Directors shall have the right to undertake minor adjustments to the LTI I 2024 and the Plan due to applicable foreign rules and laws.PROPOSAL BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS WITH RESPECT TO RESOLUTIONS UNDER ITEMS 9b AND 16-179b. Resolution with respect to disposition of the Company’s result according to the adopted Balance SheetThe Board of Directors proposes that no dividend be paid for the financial year 2023 and that the Company's available funds be capitalized in a new account.16.

The subscription for warrants shall be made up to and including 15 May 2024. Each warrant of series II 2024 entitles the holder to subscribe for one (1) share in the Company. The warrants of series II 2024 shall be issued without compensation to the Company.The warrants may be exercised for subscription of shares during the period from and during the period commencing on the date of the registration of the issue resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office up to and including the date ten (10) years after the registration of the issue resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office  at an exercise price equal to the shares’ quota value  at the time of exercise.In order to fulfil the commitments arising from LTI II 2024  the Board of Directors proposes that the general meeting authorizes that the Company may assign to a third party or in another way dispose of the warrants of series II 2024 in accordance with above.A detailed resolution proposal for the issue of warrants of series II 2024  including complete terms and conditions for the warrant  is set out in Appendix A (including its sub-appendix).Recalculation due to split  consolidation  new share issue etc.The exercise price for warrants in LTI II 2024  determined as set out above  shall be rounded to the nearest SEK 0.10 whereby SEK 0.05 shall be rounded upwards. The exercise price and/or the number of shares that each warrant entitles to subscription for may be recalculated in the event of a split or reverse split of shares in accordance with customary re-calculation termsCostsThe RSUs are expected to incur accounting costs (accounted for in accordance with the accounting standard IFRS 2) as well as social security costs during the term of the RSUs. According to IFRS 2  the RSUs costs shall be recorded as a personnel expense in the income statement during the vestingperiod. The total costs for 849 195 RSUs  calculated in accordance with IFRS 2  are estimated to amount to approximately SEK 197.0 million during the term of the program (excluding social security costs). The estimated costs have been calculated based on  inter alia  the following assumptions: (i) a market price of the Company’s share/ADS of USD 22.53 equivalent to SEK 232.03 at the time of grant  based on a USD-SEK exchange rate of 10.2989 (ii) that the maximum number of RSUs encompassed by this resolution proposal are granted to participants  (iii) that all granted RSUs will vest and (iv) that holders of RSUs receive a share  ADS or warrant of series LTI II 2024. Social security costs  which are expected to arise primarily in connection with holders of RSUs receive a share  ADS or warrant of series LTI II 2024  are estimated to amount to approximately SEK 52.3 million during the term of the program  based on inter alia the assumptions set out under items (i)–(iv) above as well as an average social security rate of 23 per cent and an increase in the market price of the Company’s share/ADS to USD 26.0.Other costs related to the LTI II 2024  including inter alia expenses related to fees to external advisors  external appraiser and administration of the incentive program  are estimated to amount to approximately SEK 1.5 million during the term of the program.Based on the assumptions set out above  the total costs of the LTI II 2024 are estimated to approximately SEK 250.8 million in total during the term of the program. These costs shall be seen in relation to the total employee benefits expenses of the Olink group  which during the financial year 2023 amounted to SEK 957.4 million.Motivation in respect of vesting and exercise conditionsAccording to recommendations laid down by the Swedish Corporate Governance Board (Sw. Kollegiet för svensk bolagsstyrning)  the vesting period  or the period between the date of grant until the date when a warrant or stock option may be exercised  shall as a general rule not be shorter than three (3) years. As set out further above  RSUs will vest in equal installments on 7 April for four years and holders of RSUs will receive a share  ADS or warrant  provided that all applicable vesting conditions have then been fulfilled. The reason for applying such terms  which are not in line with the recommendations of the Swedish Corporate Governance Board as set out above  is that the Board of Directors of the Company deem such terms to be in line with market practice for stock option programs in most of the countries where the intended participants in the LTI II 2024 are operative. It is therefore  in the opinion of the Board of Directors of the Company  in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders to apply such terms in order to fulfil the objectives of the LTI II 2024.DilutionUpon exercise of all warrants of series II 2024 issued within the frame of LTI II 2024 for subscription of shares  up to 849 195 shares (with reservation for any re-calculation) may be issued  equivalent to a maximum dilution of approximately 0.68 per cent of the shares and votes of the Company. Upon full exercise of warrants of series II 2024 for subscription of shares  the Company’s share capital will increase with SEK 2 065 162.94. The dilution calculations have been based on the maximum number of shares and votes which may be issued upon exercise of RSUs  divided by the total number of outstanding shares and votes in the Company as per 20 February 2024 after such issues.Preparation of the proposalThe proposal to the incentive program LTI II 2024 has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee and the Board of Directors together with external advisers. The Company’s board member and CEO Jon Heimer has not participated in the preparations of LTI II 2024.The reason for the deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rightsThe reason for the deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights is to implement an incentive program for the members of the group management  key employees  other employees and consultants in the Company and the group.Majority requirementA resolution to approve the present proposal is valid only where supported by shareholders holding not less than nine-tenths (9/10) of both the shares voted for and of the shares represented at the general meeting.AuthorizationIt is further proposed that the Board of Directors  or a person appointed by the Board of Directors  is authorized to undertake such minor adjustments in the decision that may be required for the registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and Euroclear Sweden AB and that the Board of Directors shall have the right to undertake minor adjustments to the LTI II 2024 and the Plan due to applicable foreign rules and laws.Outstanding incentive programsThe Company does have the following outstanding share-related incentive programs.LTI 2021.

Remuneration to the CEO is decided by the Board of Directors  based on a proposal from the Remuneration Committee. Remuneration to other senior executives is decided by the CEO after consultation with the Remuneration Committee.Variable cash remuneration may be paid after the measurement period has ended or be subject to deferred payment. The Board of Directors shall have the possibility  under applicable law or contractual provisions  to in whole or in part reclaim variable remuneration paid on incorrect grounds (claw-back).Termination of employmentSenior executives shall be employed until further notice.

The remuneration may be paid during the period the non-compete undertaking is applicable  and no longer than a period of twelve months after the termination of the employment.Salary and employment conditions for employeesIn the preparation of the Board of Directors’ proposal for these remuneration guidelines  salary and employment conditions for employees of HMS have been taken into account by including information on the employees’ total income  the components of the remuneration and increase and growth rate over time  in the Remuneration Committee’s and the Board of Directors’ basis of decision when evaluating whether the guidelines and the limitations set out herein are reasonable.The decision-making process to determine  review and implement the guidelinesThe Board of Directors has established a Remuneration Committee. The committee’s tasks include preparing the Board of Directors’ decision to propose guidelines for executive remuneration. The Board of Directors shall prepare a proposal for new guidelines at least every fourth year and submit it to the general meeting. The guidelines shall be in force until new guidelines are adopted by the general meeting. The Remuneration Committee shall also monitor and evaluate programs for variable remuneration for the executive management  the application of the guidelines for executive remuneration as well as the current remuneration structures and compensation levels in HMS. The members of the Remuneration Committee are independent in of the company and its executive management. The CEO and other members of the executive management do not participate in the Board of Directors’ processing of and resolutions regarding remuneration-related matters in so far as they are affected by such matters.Derogation from the guidelinesThe Board of Directors may temporarily resolve to derogate from the guidelines  in whole or in part if in a specific case there is special cause for the derogation and a derogation is necessary to serveHMS’ long-term interests  including its sustainability  or to ensure HMS’ financial viability. As set out above  the Remuneration Committee’s tasks include preparing the Board of Directors’ resolutions in remuneration-related matters. This includes any resolutions to derogate from the guidelines.Description of significant changes to the guidelines and comments from shareholdersIn relation to the current guidelines  resolved by the Annual General Meeting 2022  the proposal for the Annual General Meeting 2024 entails that senior executives  shall be able to receive an annual variable cash remuneration amounting to a maximum of 80 percent of the fixed cash salary  compared to previously 50 percent of the fixed cash salary  and a long-term variable cash bonus (LTI bonus) amounting to a maximum of 40 percent of the fixed cash salary each respective year in the measurement period  compared to previously 50 percent of the fixed cash salary per the last year in the measurement period  with the adjustment that only one LTI program may be ongoing at a time. The proposed adjustments are a result of HMS’ increased presence in the USA  which has prompted a review of the current guidelines. In addition  the provision of pension premiums for other senior executives (other than the CEO) has been adjusted to adapt to the new income cap for pensionable income of 30 income base amounts from ITP1. The Board of Directors has not received any comments from shareholders on the guidelines for remuneration to senior executives.Resolution on the Board of Directors’ proposal for authorisation of the Board of Directors to resolve on new share issues (item 16)The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to authorise the Board of Directors to resolve on new share issues in accordance with the following conditions:The authorisation may be exercised on one or several occasions up to the Annual General Meeting 2025.Issues may be made of such number of shares that corresponds to a maximum of 10 per cent of the company’s share capital on the date when the authorisation is utilised for the first time.An issue may be made with or without deviation from the shareholders’ preferential right.An issue may be made against cash payment  by set-off or by contribution in kind.The subscription price shall  at deviation from the shareholders’ preferential right  be determined in accordance with market practice. The Board of Directors shall be entitled to determine other terms of the issue.The purpose of the authorisation  and the reason for the deviation from the shareholders’ preferential right  is to enable the company to finance or carry out  in whole or in part  acquisitions of companies.Under the Swedish Companies Act  the resolution of the General Meeting on authorisation for the Board of Directors to resolve on new share issues requires the support of shareholders representing at least two-thirds of both the number of votes cast and the shares represented at the Meeting in order to be valid.Resolution on the Board of Directors’ proposal on (a) implementation of a performance-based Share Saving Plan 2025-2028 for all employees  (b) authorisation of the Board of Directors to resolve on repurchase of own shares within Share Saving Plan 2025-2028 and (c) transfer of own shares to participants in Share Saving Plan 2025-2028 (item 17)A. Implementation of performance-based Share Saving Plan 2025-2028 for all employeesThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves on implementation of the below described Share Saving Plan 2025-2028 to all employees  comprising a maximum of 100 000 shares in the company  according to the following principal conditions:All permanent employees within the group as per 31 December 2024 (approximately 1 300 persons) will be offered to participate in the program. In order to participate in the program  the participant must  with own funds  make an investment of minimum 1% and maximum between 3% and 6% (depending on position  se item 2 below) of his or her annual fixed gross salary in shares in the company at market price over Nasdaq Stockholm (“Saving Shares”). Notification of participation in Share Saving Program 2025-2028 shall be made no later than 31 December 2024. The investment shall take place during 2025 and shall be made to an amount corresponding to minimum 1% of the gross salary for 2024  with the possibility to further investment up to the fixed maximum amount.For senior executives (approximately 120 persons)  it is required that the own investment amounts to a minimum of 1% and a maximum of 6% of the gross salary for 2024. For other employees (approximately 1 180 persons)  it is required that the own investment amounts to a minimum of 1% and maximum of 3% of the gross salary for 2024.Each Saving Share entitles the participant to receive free of charge a maximum of two (2) shares in the company  based on the achievement of certain performance conditions (“Performance Share”). The performance conditions are based on the development of earnings per share according to determined objectives by the Board of Directors during the financial years 2026-2028 (the “Measurement Period”). The performance condition that has to be achieved of exceeded relates to average annual growth of the company’s earnings per share during the Measurement Period  whereby Performance Shares is received linearly between the interval 0-20% and an average annual growth during the Measurement Period of 20% corresponds to maximum allotment  i.e. two (2) Performance Shares. Through the connection to earnings per share throughout the measurement period  the performance conditions contribute to the company’s long-term value creation.Upon achievement of the performance conditions  Performance Shares will be received within 60 days after the day of the publishing of the year-end report regarding the financial year 2028. Subject to customary exceptions  the participant does not receive Performance Shares if the participant does not acquire Saving Shares according to determined minimum level  does not hold all of his or her Saving Shares up to and including 31 December 2028  or does not remain in his or her employment or equivalent within the group as per this date.A small number of selected consultants with assignments of essential importance for the company should be offered to  on comparable terms and conditions  participate in Share Saving Plan 2025-2028.The Board of Directors shall be responsible for the detailed terms and conditions of Share Saving Plan 2025-2028 within the scope the above stated principal terms and conditions  as well as such reasonable adjustments of the program which are deemed appropriate or efficient due to legal or administrative conditions. In addition  the Board of Directors shall have the right to make minor adjustments to the terms and conditions and the administration of the share saving plan  in order to comply with local rules  market practice and administrative circumstances  in a cost-effective manner in some of the group's jurisdictions other than Sweden.B. Authorisation for the Board of Directors to resolve on repurchase of own shares within Share Saving Plan 2025-2028To enable the company’s delivery of Performance Shares according to Share Saving Plan 2025-2028  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to authorise the Board of Directors to resolve on repurchase of own shares in accordance with the following conditions:The repurchase of shares shall take place on Nasdaq Stockholm.The authorisation may be exercised on one or several occasions until the Annual General Meeting 2025.The repurchase shall as a maximum comprise the number of shares required for delivery of Performance Shares to the participants in Share Saving Plan 2025-2028  however no more than 100 000 shares.Repurchase shall be made at a price within the share price interval registered from time to time  where share price interval means the difference between the highest buying price and the lowest selling price.Payment of the repurchased shares shall be made in cash.The Board of Directors shall have the right to resolve on other terms and conditions for the repurchase.The repurchase is expected to take place on one or several occasions in conjunction with the notification and investment periods during 2024 and 2025. To the extent that repurchase must be made after the Annual General Meeting 2025 in order to ensure delivery of shares according to the program’s maximum amount  a new authorisation for repurchase of shares is required by the next Annual General Meeting.C. Transfer of own shares to participants in the Share Saving Plan 2025-2028To be able to deliver Performance Shares under Share Saving Plan 2025-2028  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves on transfer of own shares in accordance with the following conditions:A maximum number of 100 000 shares may be transferred free of charge to participants in Share Saving Plan 2025-2028.With deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights  the right to acquire shares free of charge shall comprise persons within the group participating in Share Saving Plan 2025-2028  with a right for each of the participant to acquire the maximum number of shares stipulated in the terms and conditions of the Share Saving Plan 2025-2028.Transfer of shares shall be made free of charge at the time for  and according to the terms for  the allotment of shares to participants in Share Saving Plan 2025-2028.The number of shares that may be transferred under Share Saving Plan 2025-2028 may be recalculated due to any intervening split or reverse share split  bonus issue  preferential issue and/or similar corporate actions.The reason for deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights is to enable the company to transfer Performance Shares to the participants in Share Saving Plan 2025-2028.Shares that have been acquired by the company  and which are not transferred to participants in the Share Saving Plan 2025-2028 may be transferred to participants in previous share saving plans or future share saving plans decided on by the General Meeting of the company. Also  such shares acquired by the company within previous years' share saving plans may be transferred to participants in the Share Saving Plan 2025-2028  previous share saving plans or future share saving plans decided on by the General Meeting. Transfer shall take place in accordance with applicable rules for the current share saving plan.Estimated costsThe program will generate costs related to the application of IFRS 2 “Share-related remuneration” amounting to approximately MSEK 37 and costs for social security contributions of approximately MSEK 13 for the shares which are allotted free of charge. The total effect on the income statement is estimated to amount to approximately MSEK 50  distributed over the years 2025-2028.Costs according to IFRS 2 do not affect the cash flow or equity during the duration of the Share Saving Plan. The acquisition cost of the shares is estimated to approximately MSEK 37 and will affect the cash flow and equity in connection with acquisition of the shares. The social security contributions effect the equity continuously  but the cash flow only in 2029  after that the shares has been allotted. Administrative costs for the program are estimated to amount to MSEK 0.8 during the duration of the program.The above cost-estimate is based on assumptions that just over half of the employees participate in the program  that all participants remain until the end of the program  an investment level per participant based on historical outcome and a maximum outcome on the performance conditions corresponding to two (2) Performance Shares per Saving Share. For the share price at the end of the program  a development corresponding to the outcome of the performance condition earnings per share has been assumed.Reason for the proposalThe Board of Directors’ reason for the abovementioned proposal on Share Saving Plan 2025-2028 is that a personal long-term owner commitment in the company by the employees is expected to stimulate an increased interest for the company’s operation and earnings  and to increase the motivation and affinity with the company. The offering and participation in the Share Saving Plan shall be considered as a part of the total remuneration package. Therefore  the Board of Directors assesses that the Share Saving Plan is favourably for both the company and its shareholders. It is the Board of Directors’ intention to annually return to the Annual General Meeting with proposals for share saving plans with equivalent conditions and effects. In case the conditions for the assumptions on number of employees that may be offered to participate in the share saving program or otherwise that is the basis for the calculations of the maximum size of the program change  the Board of Directors’ intends to return with a supplementary proposal to the Annual General Meeting 2025 regarding repurchase and transfer of own shares within Share Saving Plan 2025-2028  in order to ensure that all employees as per 31 December 2024 who wish to participate in the program can do so.Effects on key ratiosAs per the date of the Board of Directors’ proposal  the number of shares in the company amounts to 46 818 868. The Share Saving Plan 2025-2028 is expected to result in acquisition and transfer of a total of approximately 100 000 shares  which corresponds to approximately 0.21% of the total number of outstanding shares and votes. The key ratio earnings per share is not expected to be affected substantially.Majority resolutionDecision on the Board of Directors’ proposal under items A  B and C shall be made as a joint decision. The proposal  to be valid  must be supported by shareholders holding at least nine-tenths of both the number of votes cast  as well as of the number of shares represented at the meeting.Shareholders’ right to receive informationThe Board of Directors and CEO shall at the Annual General Meeting  if any shareholder so requests and the Board of Directors believes that it can be done without material harm to the company  provide information regarding circumstances that may affect the assessment of an item on the agenda  circumstances that may affect the assessment of the company’s or its subsidiaries’ financial situation and the company’s relation to another company within the group.Available documentsThe Nomination Committee’s reasoned statement and form of power of attorney are available at the company and on the company’s website  www.hms-networks.com .The Annual Report and Auditor’s Report for the parent company and the group for the 2023 financial year  the Board of Directors reasoned statement regarding the proposal for dividend and the Board of Directors complete proposal regarding items 14-17 and the Auditors’ statement on whether the current guidelines for remuneration to senior executives have been complied with  will be available at the company and on the company’s website  www.hms-networks.com   no later than April 2  2024.The documents will be sent free of charge to shareholders who so request and state their postal address.

Remuneration to the CEO is decided by the Board of Directors  based on a proposal from the Remuneration Committee. Remuneration to other senior executives is decided by the CEO after consultation with the Remuneration Committee.Variable cash remuneration may be paid after the measurement period has ended or be subject to deferred payment. The Board of Directors shall have the possibility  under applicable law or contractual provisions  to in whole or in part reclaim variable remuneration paid on incorrect grounds (claw-back).Termination of employmentSenior executives shall be employed until further notice.

The remuneration may be paid during the period the non-compete undertaking is applicable  and no longer than a period of twelve months after the termination of the employment.Salary and employment conditions for employeesIn the preparation of the Board of Directors’ proposal for these remuneration guidelines  salary and employment conditions for employees of HMS have been taken into account by including information on the employees’ total income  the components of the remuneration and increase and growth rate over time  in the Remuneration Committee’s and the Board of Directors’ basis of decision when evaluating whether the guidelines and the limitations set out herein are reasonable.The decision-making process to determine  review and implement the guidelinesThe Board of Directors has established a Remuneration Committee. The committee’s tasks include preparing the Board of Directors’ decision to propose guidelines for executive remuneration. The Board of Directors shall prepare a proposal for new guidelines at least every fourth year and submit it to the general meeting. The guidelines shall be in force until new guidelines are adopted by the general meeting. The Remuneration Committee shall also monitor and evaluate programs for variable remuneration for the executive management  the application of the guidelines for executive remuneration as well as the current remuneration structures and compensation levels in HMS. The members of the Remuneration Committee are independent in of the company and its executive management. The CEO and other members of the executive management do not participate in the Board of Directors’ processing of and resolutions regarding remuneration-related matters in so far as they are affected by such matters.Derogation from the guidelinesThe Board of Directors may temporarily resolve to derogate from the guidelines  in whole or in part if in a specific case there is special cause for the derogation and a derogation is necessary to serveHMS’ long-term interests  including its sustainability  or to ensure HMS’ financial viability. As set out above  the Remuneration Committee’s tasks include preparing the Board of Directors’ resolutions in remuneration-related matters. This includes any resolutions to derogate from the guidelines.Description of significant changes to the guidelines and comments from shareholdersIn relation to the current guidelines  resolved by the Annual General Meeting 2022  the proposal for the Annual General Meeting 2024 entails that senior executives  shall be able to receive an annual variable cash remuneration amounting to a maximum of 80 percent of the fixed cash salary  compared to previously 50 percent of the fixed cash salary  and a long-term variable cash bonus (LTI bonus) amounting to a maximum of 40 percent of the fixed cash salary each respective year in the measurement period  compared to previously 50 percent of the fixed cash salary per the last year in the measurement period  with the adjustment that only one LTI program may be ongoing at a time. The proposed adjustments are a result of HMS’ increased presence in the USA  which has prompted a review of the current guidelines. In addition  the provision of pension premiums for other senior executives (other than the CEO) has been adjusted to adapt to the new income cap for pensionable income of 30 income base amounts from ITP1. The Board of Directors has not received any comments from shareholders on the guidelines for remuneration to senior executives.Resolution on the Board of Directors’ proposal for authorisation of the Board of Directors to resolve on new share issues (item 16)The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to authorise the Board of Directors to resolve on new share issues in accordance with the following conditions:The authorisation may be exercised on one or several occasions up to the Annual General Meeting 2025.Issues may be made of such number of shares that corresponds to a maximum of 10 per cent of the company’s share capital on the date when the authorisation is utilised for the first time.An issue may be made with or without deviation from the shareholders’ preferential right.An issue may be made against cash payment  by set-off or by contribution in kind.The subscription price shall  at deviation from the shareholders’ preferential right  be determined in accordance with market practice. The Board of Directors shall be entitled to determine other terms of the issue.The purpose of the authorisation  and the reason for the deviation from the shareholders’ preferential right  is to enable the company to finance or carry out  in whole or in part  acquisitions of companies.Under the Swedish Companies Act  the resolution of the General Meeting on authorisation for the Board of Directors to resolve on new share issues requires the support of shareholders representing at least two-thirds of both the number of votes cast and the shares represented at the Meeting in order to be valid.Resolution on the Board of Directors’ proposal on (a) implementation of a performance-based Share Saving Plan 2025-2028 for all employees  (b) authorisation of the Board of Directors to resolve on repurchase of own shares within Share Saving Plan 2025-2028 and (c) transfer of own shares to participants in Share Saving Plan 2025-2028 (item 17)A. Implementation of performance-based Share Saving Plan 2025-2028 for all employeesThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves on implementation of the below described Share Saving Plan 2025-2028 to all employees  comprising a maximum of 100 000 shares in the company  according to the following principal conditions:All permanent employees within the group as per 31 December 2024 (approximately 1 300 persons) will be offered to participate in the program. In order to participate in the program  the participant must  with own funds  make an investment of minimum 1% and maximum between 3% and 6% (depending on position  se item 2 below) of his or her annual fixed gross salary in shares in the company at market price over Nasdaq Stockholm (“Saving Shares”). Notification of participation in Share Saving Program 2025-2028 shall be made no later than 31 December 2024. The investment shall take place during 2025 and shall be made to an amount corresponding to minimum 1% of the gross salary for 2024  with the possibility to further investment up to the fixed maximum amount.For senior executives (approximately 120 persons)  it is required that the own investment amounts to a minimum of 1% and a maximum of 6% of the gross salary for 2024. For other employees (approximately 1 180 persons)  it is required that the own investment amounts to a minimum of 1% and maximum of 3% of the gross salary for 2024.Each Saving Share entitles the participant to receive free of charge a maximum of two (2) shares in the company  based on the achievement of certain performance conditions (“Performance Share”). The performance conditions are based on the development of earnings per share according to determined objectives by the Board of Directors during the financial years 2026-2028 (the “Measurement Period”). The performance condition that has to be achieved of exceeded relates to average annual growth of the company’s earnings per share during the Measurement Period  whereby Performance Shares is received linearly between the interval 0-20% and an average annual growth during the Measurement Period of 20% corresponds to maximum allotment  i.e. two (2) Performance Shares. Through the connection to earnings per share throughout the measurement period  the performance conditions contribute to the company’s long-term value creation.Upon achievement of the performance conditions  Performance Shares will be received within 60 days after the day of the publishing of the year-end report regarding the financial year 2028. Subject to customary exceptions  the participant does not receive Performance Shares if the participant does not acquire Saving Shares according to determined minimum level  does not hold all of his or her Saving Shares up to and including 31 December 2028  or does not remain in his or her employment or equivalent within the group as per this date.A small number of selected consultants with assignments of essential importance for the company should be offered to  on comparable terms and conditions  participate in Share Saving Plan 2025-2028.The Board of Directors shall be responsible for the detailed terms and conditions of Share Saving Plan 2025-2028 within the scope the above stated principal terms and conditions  as well as such reasonable adjustments of the program which are deemed appropriate or efficient due to legal or administrative conditions. In addition  the Board of Directors shall have the right to make minor adjustments to the terms and conditions and the administration of the share saving plan  in order to comply with local rules  market practice and administrative circumstances  in a cost-effective manner in some of the group's jurisdictions other than Sweden.B. Authorisation for the Board of Directors to resolve on repurchase of own shares within Share Saving Plan 2025-2028To enable the company’s delivery of Performance Shares according to Share Saving Plan 2025-2028  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to authorise the Board of Directors to resolve on repurchase of own shares in accordance with the following conditions:The repurchase of shares shall take place on Nasdaq Stockholm.The authorisation may be exercised on one or several occasions until the Annual General Meeting 2025.The repurchase shall as a maximum comprise the number of shares required for delivery of Performance Shares to the participants in Share Saving Plan 2025-2028  however no more than 100 000 shares.Repurchase shall be made at a price within the share price interval registered from time to time  where share price interval means the difference between the highest buying price and the lowest selling price.Payment of the repurchased shares shall be made in cash.The Board of Directors shall have the right to resolve on other terms and conditions for the repurchase.The repurchase is expected to take place on one or several occasions in conjunction with the notification and investment periods during 2024 and 2025. To the extent that repurchase must be made after the Annual General Meeting 2025 in order to ensure delivery of shares according to the program’s maximum amount  a new authorisation for repurchase of shares is required by the next Annual General Meeting.C. Transfer of own shares to participants in the Share Saving Plan 2025-2028To be able to deliver Performance Shares under Share Saving Plan 2025-2028  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves on transfer of own shares in accordance with the following conditions:A maximum number of 100 000 shares may be transferred free of charge to participants in Share Saving Plan 2025-2028.With deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights  the right to acquire shares free of charge shall comprise persons within the group participating in Share Saving Plan 2025-2028  with a right for each of the participant to acquire the maximum number of shares stipulated in the terms and conditions of the Share Saving Plan 2025-2028.Transfer of shares shall be made free of charge at the time for  and according to the terms for  the allotment of shares to participants in Share Saving Plan 2025-2028.The number of shares that may be transferred under Share Saving Plan 2025-2028 may be recalculated due to any intervening split or reverse share split  bonus issue  preferential issue and/or similar corporate actions.The reason for deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights is to enable the company to transfer Performance Shares to the participants in Share Saving Plan 2025-2028.Shares that have been acquired by the company  and which are not transferred to participants in the Share Saving Plan 2025-2028 may be transferred to participants in previous share saving plans or future share saving plans decided on by the General Meeting of the company. Also  such shares acquired by the company within previous years' share saving plans may be transferred to participants in the Share Saving Plan 2025-2028  previous share saving plans or future share saving plans decided on by the General Meeting. Transfer shall take place in accordance with applicable rules for the current share saving plan.Estimated costsThe program will generate costs related to the application of IFRS 2 “Share-related remuneration” amounting to approximately MSEK 37 and costs for social security contributions of approximately MSEK 13 for the shares which are allotted free of charge. The total effect on the income statement is estimated to amount to approximately MSEK 50  distributed over the years 2025-2028.Costs according to IFRS 2 do not affect the cash flow or equity during the duration of the Share Saving Plan. The acquisition cost of the shares is estimated to approximately MSEK 37 and will affect the cash flow and equity in connection with acquisition of the shares. The social security contributions effect the equity continuously  but the cash flow only in 2029  after that the shares has been allotted. Administrative costs for the program are estimated to amount to MSEK 0.8 during the duration of the program.The above cost-estimate is based on assumptions that just over half of the employees participate in the program  that all participants remain until the end of the program  an investment level per participant based on historical outcome and a maximum outcome on the performance conditions corresponding to two (2) Performance Shares per Saving Share. For the share price at the end of the program  a development corresponding to the outcome of the performance condition earnings per share has been assumed.Reason for the proposalThe Board of Directors’ reason for the abovementioned proposal on Share Saving Plan 2025-2028 is that a personal long-term owner commitment in the company by the employees is expected to stimulate an increased interest for the company’s operation and earnings  and to increase the motivation and affinity with the company. The offering and participation in the Share Saving Plan shall be considered as a part of the total remuneration package. Therefore  the Board of Directors assesses that the Share Saving Plan is favourably for both the company and its shareholders. It is the Board of Directors’ intention to annually return to the Annual General Meeting with proposals for share saving plans with equivalent conditions and effects. In case the conditions for the assumptions on number of employees that may be offered to participate in the share saving program or otherwise that is the basis for the calculations of the maximum size of the program change  the Board of Directors’ intends to return with a supplementary proposal to the Annual General Meeting 2025 regarding repurchase and transfer of own shares within Share Saving Plan 2025-2028  in order to ensure that all employees as per 31 December 2024 who wish to participate in the program can do so.Effects on key ratiosAs per the date of the Board of Directors’ proposal  the number of shares in the company amounts to 46 818 868. The Share Saving Plan 2025-2028 is expected to result in acquisition and transfer of a total of approximately 100 000 shares  which corresponds to approximately 0.21% of the total number of outstanding shares and votes. The key ratio earnings per share is not expected to be affected substantially.Majority resolutionDecision on the Board of Directors’ proposal under items A  B and C shall be made as a joint decision. The proposal  to be valid  must be supported by shareholders holding at least nine-tenths of both the number of votes cast  as well as of the number of shares represented at the meeting.Shareholders’ right to receive informationThe Board of Directors and CEO shall at the Annual General Meeting  if any shareholder so requests and the Board of Directors believes that it can be done without material harm to the company  provide information regarding circumstances that may affect the assessment of an item on the agenda  circumstances that may affect the assessment of the company’s or its subsidiaries’ financial situation and the company’s relation to another company within the group.Available documentsThe Nomination Committee’s reasoned statement and form of power of attorney are available at the company and on the company’s website  www.hms-networks.com .The Annual Report and Auditor’s Report for the parent company and the group for the 2023 financial year  the Board of Directors reasoned statement regarding the proposal for dividend and the Board of Directors complete proposal regarding items 14-17 and the Auditors’ statement on whether the current guidelines for remuneration to senior executives have been complied with  will be available at the company and on the company’s website  www.hms-networks.com   no later than April 2  2024.The documents will be sent free of charge to shareholders who so request and state their postal address.

Resolution on the Board of Directors' proposal to guidelines for remuneration to senior executives (item 15)The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves on the following guidelines for remuneration to senior executives. These guidelines apply to persons who  during the period of time that the guidelines are in effect  are members of HMS Networks' group management. The guidelines are applicable to remuneration agreed and amendments to remuneration already agreed  after adoption of the guidelines by the Annual General Meeting 2024. These guidelines do not apply to any remuneration decided or approved by the general meeting. The guidelines' promotion of HMS Networks' business strategy  long-term interests and sustainabilityHMS is a market-leading supplier of solutions for industrial ICT (Information and Communication Technology). HMS' industrial communication products enables millions of machines  such as robots  frequency converters and air conditioning equipment  to be connected to different types of systems - a necessity to meet future demands for energy efficiency and suitability. In brief  HMS' business strategy aims to achieve profitable growth in strategic markets  focus on sustainable product development  be a global actor with local presence and to have a sustainable supply chain. A prerequisite for the successful implementation of HMS' business strategy and to the safeguarding of its interests  including its sustainability  is that the company is able to recruit and retain qualified personnel. The objective of HMS' remuneration policy for senior executives is therefore to offer competitive and market-based remuneration  in order to attract  motivate and retain competent and skilled employees. These guidelines enable the company to offer a competitive total remuneration. Further information regarding HMS business strategy is available at HMS' website  www.hms-networks.com. HMS has ongoing long-term share-related incentive plans  which have been resolved by the general meeting and are therefore excluded from these guidelines. The plans comprise all employees within HMS and aims to give the employees an increased interest for the company's operation and earnings  and to increase the motivation and affinity with the company through a long-term owner commitment. The plans further enable HMS to offer a competitive total remuneration and thereby enabling the company to recruit and retain competent personnel. The performance criteria are currently linked to profit per share. Further  the incentive plans require own investment during a certain holding period. Further information on the incentive plans is available at HMS' website  www.hms-networks.com. Types of remuneration  etc.The remuneration to senior executives shall be market-based and may consist of fixed cash salary  variable cash remuneration  pension benefits and other benefits  as well as further variable remuneration under certain extraordinary circumstances. Additionally  the general meeting may - irrespective of these guidelines - resolve on  among other things  share-related or share price-related remuneration. Fixed cash salary shall be determined on the basis that it should be competitive together with short- and long-term incentives. The absolute amount shall be determined based on the current position and the competence  experience and performance of the individual. The fixed cash salary shall be revised annually. Variable cash remuneration shall be based on predetermined and measurable financial and non-financial objectives of the group. The measurement period for the objectives for annual variable cash remuneration shall be one year and annual variable cash remuneration may amount to a maximum of 80 percent of the fixed cash salary. In addition to annual variable cash remuneration  senior executives shall be able to receive a long-term variable cash bonus (LTI bonus) amounting to a maximum of 40 percent of the fixed cash salary each respective year in the measurement period. The LTI bonus shall be based on achieved financial and operational objectives  related to  for example  growth and operating profit  after a multi-year measurement period in three to five years. Payment of LTI bonus shall take place after the end of the measurement period and only one LTI program may be ongoing at a time. The distribution between fixed cash salary and variable cash remuneration shall be proportionate to the executive's responsibility and authority. The objectives shall primarily relate to growth and profitability  where the relationship between these performance measures shall determine the outcome of variable cash remuneration. In addition  individual objectives may be established. The objectives shall be designed so as to contribute to HMS' business strategy and long-term interests  including its sustainability  by for example being clearly linked to the business strategy or promote the executive's long-term development. For the CEO  pension benefits  including health insurance benefits (Sw: sjukförsäkringsförmåner) shall be premium defined. The pension premium may amount to a maximum of 35 percent of the pensionable income up to 28.5 price base amounts  and a maximum of 25 percent on exceeding part of the pensionable income. For other senior executives  pension benefits  including health insurance benefits  shall be premium defined. The pension premium shall amount to a maximum of 30 percent of the pensionable income  up to 30 income base amounts. The variable cash remuneration shall qualify for pension benefits. LTI bonus should not be pensionable unless required by mandatory collective agreement provisions. Other benefits may include  for example  medical insurance (Sw: sjukvårdsförsäkring)  occupational health care (Sw: företagshälsovård) and company cars. Such benefits may amount to a maximum of 10 percent of the fixed cash salary. Further variable cash remuneration may be awarded in extraordinary circumstances  provided that such extraordinary arrangements are made for the purpose of recruiting or retaining executives. Such remuneration may not exceed an amount corresponding to 50 percent of the fixed cash salary and may not be paid more than once each year per individual. Any resolution on such remuneration shall be made by the Board of Directors based on a proposal from the Remuneration Committee. For employments governed by rules other than Swedish  pension benefits and other benefits may be duly adjusted for compliance with mandatory rules or established local practice  taking into account  to the extent possible  the overall purpose of these guidelines. The satisfaction of criteria for awarding variable remuneration  etc.The Remuneration Committee shall prepare  monitor and evaluate matters related to variable cash remuneration for the Board of Directors. To the extent the criteria for awarding variable cash remuneration has been satisfied  shall be determined when the measurement period has ended. Assessments of whether financial objectives have been met  shall be based on established financial information for the period. Remuneration to the CEO is decided by the Board of Directors  based on a proposal from the Remuneration Committee. Remuneration to other senior executives is decided by the CEO after consultation with the Remuneration Committee. Variable cash remuneration may be paid after the measurement period has ended or be subject to deferred payment. The Board of Directors shall have the possibility  under applicable law or contractual provisions  to in whole or in part reclaim variable remuneration paid on incorrect grounds (claw-back). Termination of employmentSenior executives shall be employed until further notice. For the CEO  there shall be a mutual notice period of six months. If notice of termination of employment of the CEO is made by the company  a severance pay corresponding to a maximum of twelve months fixed cash salary may be paid. Other income should not be deducted from the severance pay. If notice of termination of employment is made by the CEO  severance pay should not be paid. Between the company and other senior executives  there shall be a mutual notice period of six months  without any right to severance pay. Senior executives may be compensated for a non-compete undertaking after the termination of the employment  however  only to the extent severance pay is not paid during the same period of time. Such remuneration is intended to compensate the senior executive for the difference between the fixed cash salary at the time of termination of the employment  and the (lower) income obtained  or could be obtained  by a new employment agreement  assignment or own business. The remuneration may be paid during the period the non-compete undertaking is applicable  and no longer than a period of twelve months after the termination of the employment. Salary and employment conditions for employeesIn the preparation of the Board of Directors' proposal for these remuneration guidelines  salary and employment conditions for employees of HMS have been taken into account by including information on the employees' total income  the components of the remuneration and increase and growth rate over time  in the Remuneration Committee's and the Board of Directors' basis of decision when evaluating whether the guidelines and the limitations set out herein are reasonable. The decision-making process to determine  review and implement the guidelinesThe Board of Directors has established a Remuneration Committee. The committee's tasks include preparing the Board of Directors' decision to propose guidelines for executive remuneration. The Board of Directors shall prepare a proposal for new guidelines at least every fourth year and submit it to the general meeting. The guidelines shall be in force until new guidelines are adopted by the general meeting. The Remuneration Committee shall also monitor and evaluate programs for variable remuneration for the executive management  the application of the guidelines for executive remuneration as well as the current remuneration structures and compensation levels in HMS. The members of the Remuneration Committee are independent in of the company and its executive management. The CEO and other members of the executive management do not participate in the Board of Directors' processing of and resolutions regarding remuneration-related matters in so far as they are affected by such matters. Derogation from the guidelinesThe Board of Directors may temporarily resolve to derogate from the guidelines  in whole or in part if in a specific case there is special cause for the derogation and a derogation is necessary to serveHMS' long-term interests  including its sustainability  or to ensure HMS' financial viability. As set out above  the Remuneration Committee's tasks include preparing the Board of Directors' resolutions in remuneration-related matters. This includes any resolutions to derogate from the guidelines. Description of significant changes to the guidelines and comments from shareholdersIn relation to the current guidelines  resolved by the Annual General Meeting 2022  the proposal for the Annual General Meeting 2024 entails that senior executives  shall be able to receive an annual variable cash remuneration amounting to a maximum of 80 percent of the fixed cash salary  compared to previously 50 percent of the fixed cash salary  and a long-term variable cash bonus (LTI bonus) amounting to a maximum of 40 percent of the fixed cash salary each respective year in the measurement period  compared to previously 50 percent of the fixed cash salary per the last year in the measurement period  with the adjustment that only one LTI program may be ongoing at a time. The proposed adjustments are a result of HMS' increased presence in the USA  which has prompted a review of the current guidelines. In addition  the provision of pension premiums for other senior executives (other than the CEO) has been adjusted to adapt to the new income cap for pensionable income of 30 income base amounts from ITP1. The Board of Directors has not received any comments from shareholders on the guidelines for remuneration to senior executives. Resolution on the Board of Directors' proposal for authorisation of the Board of Directors to resolve on new share issues (item 16)The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to authorise the Board of Directors to resolve on new share issues in accordance with the following conditions: The authorisation may be exercised on one or several occasions up to the Annual General Meeting 2025.Issues may be made of such number of shares that corresponds to a maximum of 10 per cent of the company's share capital on the date when the authorisation is utilised for the first time.An issue may be made with or without deviation from the shareholders' preferential right.An issue may be made against cash payment  by set-off or by contribution in kind.The subscription price shall  at deviation from the shareholders' preferential right  be determined in accordance with market practice. The Board of Directors shall be entitled to determine other terms of the issue.The purpose of the authorisation  and the reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential right  is to enable the company to finance or carry out  in whole or in part  acquisitions of companies. Under the Swedish Companies Act  the resolution of the General Meeting on authorisation for the Board of Directors to resolve on new share issues requires the support of shareholders representing at least two-thirds of both the number of votes cast and the shares represented at the Meeting in order to be valid. Resolution on the Board of Directors' proposal on (a) implementation of a performance-based Share Saving Plan 2025-2028 for all employees  (b) authorisation of the Board of Directors to resolve on repurchase of own shares within Share Saving Plan 2025-2028 and (c) transfer of own shares to participants in Share Saving Plan 2025-2028 (item 17) A. Implementation of performance-based Share Saving Plan 2025-2028 for all employees The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves on implementation of the below described Share Saving Plan 2025-2028 to all employees  comprising a maximum of 100 000 shares in the company  according to the following principal conditions: All permanent employees within the group as per 31 December 2024 (approximately 1 300 persons) will be offered to participate in the program. In order to participate in the program  the participant must  with own funds  make an investment of minimum 1% and maximum between 3% and 6% (depending on position  se item 2 below) of his or her annual fixed gross salary in shares in the company at market price over Nasdaq Stockholm (""Saving Shares""). Notification of participation in Share Saving Program 2025-2028 shall be made no later than 31 December 2024. The investment shall take place during 2025 and shall be made to an amount corresponding to minimum 1% of the gross salary for 2024  with the possibility to further investment up to the fixed maximum amount.For senior executives (approximately 120 persons)  it is required that the own investment amounts to a minimum of 1% and a maximum of 6% of the gross salary for 2024. For other employees (approximately 1 180 persons)  it is required that the own investment amounts to a minimum of 1% and maximum of 3% of the gross salary for 2024.Each Saving Share entitles the participant to receive free of charge a maximum of two (2) shares in the company  based on the achievement of certain performance conditions (""Performance Share""). The performance conditions are based on the development of earnings per share according to determined objectives by the Board of Directors during the financial years 2026-2028 (the ""Measurement Period""). The performance condition that has to be achieved of exceeded relates to average annual growth of the company's earnings per share during the Measurement Period  whereby Performance Shares is received linearly between the interval 0-20% and an average annual growth during the Measurement Period of 20% corresponds to maximum allotment  i.e. two (2) Performance Shares. Through the connection to earnings per share throughout the measurement period  the performance conditions contribute to the company's long-term value creation.Upon achievement of the performance conditions  Performance Shares will be received within 60 days after the day of the publishing of the year-end report regarding the financial year 2028. Subject to customary exceptions  the participant does not receive Performance Shares if the participant does not acquire Saving Shares according to determined minimum level  does not hold all of his or her Saving Shares up to and including 31 December 2028  or does not remain in his or her employment or equivalent within the group as per this date.A small number of selected consultants with assignments of essential importance for the company should be offered to  on comparable terms and conditions  participate in Share Saving Plan 2025-2028.The Board of Directors shall be responsible for the detailed terms and conditions of Share Saving Plan 2025-2028 within the scope the above stated principal terms and conditions  as well as such reasonable adjustments of the program which are deemed appropriate or efficient due to legal or administrative conditions. In addition  the Board of Directors shall have the right to make minor adjustments to the terms and conditions and the administration of the share saving plan  in order to comply with local rules  market practice and administrative circumstances  in a cost-effective manner in some of the group's jurisdictions other than Sweden. B. Authorisation for the Board of Directors to resolve on repurchase of own shares within Share Saving Plan 2025-2028 To enable the company's delivery of Performance Shares according to Share Saving Plan 2025-2028  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to authorise the Board of Directors to resolve on repurchase of own shares in accordance with the following conditions: The repurchase of shares shall take place on Nasdaq Stockholm.The authorisation may be exercised on one or several occasions until the Annual General Meeting 2025.The repurchase shall as a maximum comprise the number of shares required for delivery of Performance Shares to the participants in Share Saving Plan 2025-2028  however no more than 100 000 shares.Repurchase shall be made at a price within the share price interval registered from time to time  where share price interval means the difference between the highest buying price and the lowest selling price.Payment of the repurchased shares shall be made in cash.The Board of Directors shall have the right to resolve on other terms and conditions for the repurchase.The repurchase is expected to take place on one or several occasions in conjunction with the notification and investment periods during 2024 and 2025. To the extent that repurchase must be made after the Annual General Meeting 2025 in order to ensure delivery of shares according to the program's maximum amount  a new authorisation for repurchase of shares is required by the next Annual General Meeting. C. Transfer of own shares to participants in the Share Saving Plan 2025-2028 To be able to deliver Performance Shares under Share Saving Plan 2025-2028  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves on transfer of own shares in accordance with the following conditions: A maximum number of 100 000 shares may be transferred free of charge to participants in Share Saving Plan 2025-2028.With deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  the right to acquire shares free of charge shall comprise persons within the group participating in Share Saving Plan 2025-2028  with a right for each of the participant to acquire the maximum number of shares stipulated in the terms and conditions of the Share Saving Plan 2025-2028.Transfer of shares shall be made free of charge at the time for  and according to the terms for  the allotment of shares to participants in Share Saving Plan 2025-2028.The number of shares that may be transferred under Share Saving Plan 2025-2028 may be recalculated due to any intervening split or reverse share split  bonus issue  preferential issue and/or similar corporate actions. The reason for deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights is to enable the company to transfer Performance Shares to the participants in Share Saving Plan 2025-2028. Shares that have been acquired by the company  and which are not transferred to participants in the Share Saving Plan 2025-2028 may be transferred to participants in previous share saving plans or future share saving plans decided on by the General Meeting of the company. Also  such shares acquired by the company within previous years' share saving plans may be transferred to participants in the Share Saving Plan 2025-2028  previous share saving plans or future share saving plans decided on by the General Meeting. Transfer shall take place in accordance with applicable rules for the current share saving plan. Estimated costsThe program will generate costs related to the application of IFRS 2 ""Share-related remuneration"" amounting to approximately MSEK 37 and costs for social security contributions of approximately MSEK 13 for the shares which are allotted free of charge. The total effect on the income statement is estimated to amount to approximately MSEK 50  distributed over the years 2025-2028. Costs according to IFRS 2 do not affect the cash flow or equity during the duration of the Share Saving Plan. The acquisition cost of the shares is estimated to approximately MSEK 37 and will affect the cash flow and equity in connection with acquisition of the shares. The social security contributions effect the equity continuously  but the cash flow only in 2029  after that the shares has been allotted. Administrative costs for the program are estimated to amount to MSEK 0.8 during the duration of the program. The above cost-estimate is based on assumptions that just over half of the employees participate in the program  that all participants remain until the end of the program  an investment level per participant based on historical outcome and a maximum outcome on the performance conditions corresponding to two (2) Performance Shares per Saving Share. For the share price at the end of the program  a development corresponding to the outcome of the performance condition earnings per share has been assumed. Reason for the proposalThe Board of Directors' reason for the abovementioned proposal on Share Saving Plan 2025-2028 is that a personal long-term owner commitment in the company by the employees is expected to stimulate an increased interest for the company's operation and earnings  and to increase the motivation and affinity with the company. The offering and participation in the Share Saving Plan shall be considered as a part of the total remuneration package. Therefore  the Board of Directors assesses that the Share Saving Plan is favourably for both the company and its shareholders. It is the Board of Directors' intention to annually return to the Annual General Meeting with proposals for share saving plans with equivalent conditions and effects. In case the conditions for the assumptions on number of employees that may be offered to participate in the share saving program or otherwise that is the basis for the calculations of the maximum size of the program change  the Board of Directors' intends to return with a supplementary proposal to the Annual General Meeting 2025 regarding repurchase and transfer of own shares within Share Saving Plan 2025-2028  in order to ensure that all employees as per 31 December 2024 who wish to participate in the program can do so. Effects on key ratiosAs per the date of the Board of Directors' proposal  the number of shares in the company amounts to 46 818 868. The Share Saving Plan 2025-2028 is expected to result in acquisition and transfer of a total of approximately 100 000 shares  which corresponds to approximately 0.21% of the total number of outstanding shares and votes. The key ratio earnings per share is not expected to be affected substantially. Majority resolutionDecision on the Board of Directors' proposal under items A  B and C shall be made as a joint decision. The proposal  to be valid  must be supported by shareholders holding at least nine-tenths of both the number of votes cast  as well as of the number of shares represented at the meeting. Shareholders' right to receive informationThe Board of Directors and CEO shall at the Annual General Meeting  if any shareholder so requests and the Board of Directors believes that it can be done without material harm to the company  provide information regarding circumstances that may affect the assessment of an item on the agenda  circumstances that may affect the assessment of the company's or its subsidiaries' financial situation and the company's relation to another company within the group.

For context  always refer to the full article.WAR. A Ukrainian national flag is seen  amid Russia's attack on Ukraine  near the front line in the newly liberated village Neskuchne in Donetsk region  Ukraine June 13  2023.Ukraine's debt management office has reached out to some investors in an effort to get them organized as a creditor groupLONDON  United Kingdom – Ukraine’s overseas bondholders are in talks to form a creditor committee ahead of debt rework talks with the country  according to four people with direct knowledge of the discussions.Time is of the essence for Ukraine to secure a restructuring before a two-year payment freeze agreed by holders of its $20 billion of outstanding international bonds ends in August.A formal group could kick off talks ahead of the International Monetary Fund’s spring meetings  two sources said  which are scheduled to start on April 17 in Washington.Russia’s full-scale invasion in February 2022 has shattered Ukraine’s economy and finances  forcing it into a sovereign default. This would be the first effort to formalize debt talks between private bondholders and the country.A formal group would be able to engage with the government to hold detailed discussions and exchange concrete proposal  involving privileged information.The current push to get creditors together is coming from a number of sides  according to the sources.Ukraine’s debt management office has reached out to some investors in an effort to get them organized as a creditor group  the sources said.Weil  the law firm that advised creditors on the nation’s 2015 restructuring and on the payment pause  has also reached out to some of the country’s largest creditors to prepare for debt talks  according to four sources  who asked not to be named because the talks are private.The creditor committee is expected to include eight to 12 large asset managers  one of the sources said.Weil did not immediately respond to a request for comment.A spokesperson for Ukraine’s DMO said authorities had never stopped exchanging opinions with the market on debt strategy and sustainability.“We keep collecting the feedback from investors on the approaches towards the commercial debt treatment in line with the intention we publicly announced a year ago ” the spokesperson said.Russia’s frozen assetsThe war-torn economy has been sounding out major investors since late 2023 over plans to restructure the country’s international debt and the possibility of raising fresh financing  as previously reported by Reuters.But so far discussions have only been held informally.What a restructuring could look like is unclear as it involves an economy engulfed in a war whose outlook  fiscal position and ability to pay back its debt remain highly uncertain.Some bondholders are hoping to emerge from a debt rework with new bonds that would deliver interest payments from the start  according to two of the sources. However  paying foreign bondholders might be unpalatable for Kyiv which is struggling to shore up its finances to keep the country afloat.In addition to issuing bonds as part of the rework  Ukraine could raise fresh financing by selling collateralized and guaranteed bonds.These could see Ukraine’s international partners – either multilateral lenders or individual countries – provide collateral for the new bonds  akin to the so-called Brady bonds issued by Latin American countries in the late 1980s that were backed by US Treasuries.The debt talks will unfold as Western officials are weighing confiscating some of the $300-350 billion worth of frozen Russian assets to help support Ukraine  but how it will be done remains highly complex given it would set a contested precedent.The reserves locked in the European Union – essentially bonds and other types of securities in which the Russian central bank had invested – are held in a Brussels-based depository called Euroclear. – Rappler.com,neutral,0.02,0.8,0.18,negative,0.03,0.24,0.73,True,English,"['$20-billion debt talks', 'Ukraine bondholders', 'creditor group', 'sources', 'eight to 12 large asset managers', 'Ukrainian national flag', '$300-350 billion worth', 'two-year payment freeze', 'International Monetary Fund', 'Latin American countries', 'Russian central bank', 'debt management office', 'commercial debt treatment', 'outstanding international bonds', 'debt rework talks', 'international debt', 'payment pause', 'international partners', 'individual countries', 'Russian assets', 'debt strategy', 'full article', 'Donetsk region', 'creditor group', 'United Kingdom', 'creditor committee', 'four people', 'direct knowledge', 'formal group', 'spring meetings', 'full-scale invasion', 'sovereign default', 'concrete proposal', 'privileged information', 'current push', 'law firm', 'frozen assets', 'fresh financing', 'fiscal position', 'interest payments', 'multilateral lenders', 'US Treasuries', 'Western officials', 'contested precedent', 'European Union', 'other types', 'Brussels-based depository', 'debt talks', 'new bonds', 'guaranteed bonds', 'Brady bonds', 'overseas bondholders', 'private bondholders', 'foreign bondholders', 'front line', 'late 1980s', 'two sources', 'first effort', 'detailed discussions', 'largest creditors', 'four sources', 'war-torn economy', 'major investors', 'summarization', 'errors', 'context', 'WAR.', 'attack', 'Ukraine', 'village', 'Neskuchne', 'LONDON', 'country', 'Time', 'essence', 'restructuring', 'August', 'April', 'Washington', 'February', 'finances', 'government', 'number', 'sides', 'Weil', 'request', 'comment', 'spokesperson', 'DMO', 'authorities', 'opinions', 'market', 'sustainability', 'feedback', 'approaches', 'intention', 'plans', 'possibility', 'Reuters', 'outlook', 'start', 'Kyiv', 'addition', 'collateralized', 'reserves', 'securities', 'Rappler']",2024-03-15,2024-03-16,rappler.com

With their vastly increased computing power  quantum processors could break the encryption algorithms that are widely used today  potentially compromising the security of the most sensitive data and representing a threat to national sovereign interests.The project is funded by the French government as part of the France 2030 investment plan and by the European Union's Next Generation EU scheme under the France Relance recovery programme  with €6 million of additional financing from Bpifrance. It will focus on two key use cases:A hybrid post-quantum virtual private network (VPN) to provide simple  safe and quantum-resistant user access to information systems;A high-performance post-quantum hardware security module (HSM) to secure whole systems and for integration with other products.Within the consortium  TheGreenBow's expertise in VPN and software development will complement the capabilities of CryptoExperts and CryptoNext Security in encryption and both standard and advanced algorithmic cryptography  with Thales providing leadership in algorithm integration and a holistic vision of the applications ecosystem. ANSSI (a non-financed project partner) will provide a research framework and assess the validity criteria for the use cases  and all partners will benefit from Inria's fundamental research into post-quantum cryptography.About ThalesThales (Euronext Paris: HO) is a global leader in advanced technologies within three domains: Defence & Security  Aeronautics & Space  and Digital Identity & Security. It develops products and solutions that help make the world safer  greener and more inclusive.The Group invests close to €4 billion a year in Research & Development  particularly in key areas such as quantum technologies  Edge computing  6G and cybersecurity.Thales has 77 0001 ​ employees in 68 countries.

We bring together cryptography experts with complementary skills and knowledge of the field to offer a unique panel of services ranging from product development to designing new security systems. CryptoExperts' clients and partners include leading technology companies from around the world.About CryptoNext SecurityCryptoNext  based in Paris  was created in 2019 following more than twenty years of academic research in quantum-resistant cryptography by its founders. CryptoNext Security is a software vendor specialising in quantum computer-resistant cryptography (post-quantum cryptography  or PQC). It offers its Quantum Safe Remediation software suite (C-QSR)  whose reference library includes NIST standard Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) algorithms as well as the recommendations of the European National Security Agencies  and those related to protocol and certificate hybridization. It also boasts a complete set of integration tools and post-quantum application plugins to support end-user businesses and integrators in their post-quantum migration roadmap for long-term efficiency.About TheGreenBowTheGreenBow is a French cybersecurity software company that has been providing reliable VPN solutions since 1998 and whose expertise is founded on secure communications. After becoming the first vendor to achieve Common Criteria EAL3+ certification for its Windows VPN Client-approved for NATO and EU Restricted use in 2013-TheGreenBow is now a key player in the VPN client market and distributes its solutions in more than 70 countries across the world.Since late 2019  TheGreenBow's Certified Windows VPN Client has carried the label ""Used by the French Armed Forces""  indicating that the software has been implemented by services reporting to the French Ministry for the Armed Forces.About ANSSIThe National Agency for Information Systems Security (ANSSI) was created by executive order on 7 July 2009 as France's national authority on cybersecurity and cyberdefence. It reports to the Secretary General for Defence and National Security (SGDSN)  which in turn is under the authority of the Prime Minister.About InriaInria is the French national research institute for digital science and technology.

Following this  and to support an orderly transition process  Michael will continue to be available to the Company in a consultancy capacity until at least the end of 2024.As part of the Company's succession planning  Kenmare’s Nomination Committee has commenced a process to find Michael’s successor and will consider both internal and external candidates. The result of this process will be announced in due course.Michael founded Kenmare in 1987 and under his leadership  Kenmare has evolved into one of the world’s largest producers of titanium minerals. The Company serves customers operating in more than 15 countries and is responsible for 7% of global supply of titanium feedstocks. Since 2019  Kenmare has returned over $230 million to shareholders through dividends and share buy-backs.The Company has over 1 700 employees at its Moma Mine and approximately $80 million is spent with Mozambican suppliers annually  making a meaningful contribution to the local and national economy. Michael has always believed that the community around Moma should also benefit directly from the Mine’s presence  so in 2004  before production commenced  Kenmare established the Kenmare Moma Development Association (“KMAD”). During its 20-year history  KMAD has invested more than $20 million into Moma’s host communities. Its initiatives include the construction of three community health centres and over 80 classrooms; and the installation of 30 water supply systems  providing access to clean water to approximately 45 000 people.Statement from Michael Carvill  Managing Director:“As I turn 65 later this year  I feel that now is the right time for me to step down as Managing Director. It has been a privilege to lead Kenmare for almost four decades and I would like to thank all my friends and colleagues within the Company  as well as our customers  shareholders  and partners in Mozambique  for their continued support. I am pleased to leave Kenmare in a position of strength  with a tier one asset  and as the largest supplier of ilmenite in the world. It is particularly rewarding to see the transformational change that the Company has delivered in the Moma Mine’s host communities. I am proud of what Kenmare has achieved to date and confident in our team's ability to continue to execute on Kenmare’s strategy to create value for all stakeholders.""Statement from Andrew Webb  Chairman:""On behalf of the Board  I would like to thank Michael for his outstanding commitment and service to Kenmare over almost 40 years. Without Michael’s focus  determination and ability to build enduring relationships  Kenmare would not exist  and Moma might never have been developed. In addition  he has instilled the values of respect  innovation  and continual improvement at every level of the business  positioning Kenmare as both a trusted corporate citizen and a market leader. We are very grateful for Michael’s tremendous prior and ongoing contribution to Kenmare  and are pleased to be retaining his skills and experience within the business until at least the end of the year to ensure a smooth transition.”This announcement is made in accordance with Listing Rule 9.6.11 and contains inside information as defined in article 7(1) of the Market Abuse Regulation.For further information  please contact:Kenmare Resources plcJeremy Dibb / Katharine Sutton / Michael StarkeInvestor Relationsir@kenmareresources.comTel: +353 1 671 0411Mob: +353 87 943 0367 / +353 87 663 0875Murray (PR advisor)Paul O’Kanepokane@murraygroup.ieTel: +353 1 498 0300Mob: +353 86 609 0221About Kenmare ResourcesKenmare Resources plc is one of the world's largest producers of mineral sands products.

It will be powered by an advanced GE Vernova 9HA.02 gas turbine  a steam turbine  a generator and a Heat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG)  which will integrate with a state-of-the-art carbon capture plant using Technip Energies’ Canopy by T.ENTM solution powered by the Shell CANSOLV® CO 2 capture technology.Technip Energies  GE Vernova  and Balfour Beatty  supported by Shell in the UK are forming the Carbon Capture Alliance (CCA). The alliance members are deeply committed to long-term investment in the UK  with members already possessing a significant UK footprint and a mature UK supply chain.In March 2023  the UK government announced up to £20 billion to support the initial deployment of CCUS  focused on creating four clusters by 2030  including the East Coast cluster which includes Teesside. Government analysis shows that up to 10 gigawatts of power CCUS could be needed in order to decarbonise the UK power sector by 2035 (10GW is around 10% of the total UK electricity system today).Arnaud Pieton  CEO of Technip Energies  commented  “Our selection for the Net Zero Teesside Power project is a testament to Technip Energies growing leadership position as an integrated state-of-the-art CCUS solutions provider. By capturing up to 2 million tonnes of CO 2 at a large power plant  we collectively rise to the challenge of scale by providing sustainable and available energy at a large scale. With our partners GE Vernova and Balfour Beatty  we are honoured to contribute to this flagship project that supports bp and the UK in their goal of developing one of the first decarbonised industrial clusters in the world.”Maví Zingoni  CEO  Power at GE Vernova commented: “The development of Net Zero Teesside Power  one of the world’s first commercial scale gas-fired power stations with carbon capture  marks a huge step towards supporting the UK government’s commitment to fully decarbonise its power system by 2035. GE Vernova will help bring proven expertise in natural gas combined cycle plant engineering  operability  and full-scale integration to support carbon abatement for this project. We believe post-combustion carbon capture can play a crucial role in reducing emissions and ensuring dispatchable power in the future.”Leo Quinn  CEO of Balfour Beatty Group  said: “Today’s announcement takes us a step closer to realising one of the world’s first commercial scale gas-fired power stations with carbon capture. It’s a significant milestone in delivering the critical infrastructure needed to transition the UK to Net Zero. Balfour Beatty’s market leading capabilities  underpinned by our unrivalled experience and proven track record in delivering complex infrastructure projects  means we are perfectly positioned to support the delivery of this critical project alongside Technip Energies and GE Vernova – proving on the world-stage that the UK is primed and ready to lead the way in decarbonising our industrial footprint.”About Technip EnergiesTechnip Energies is a leading Engineering & Technology company for the energy transition  with leadership positions in Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG)  hydrogen and ethylene as well as growing market positions in blue and green hydrogen  sustainable chemistry and CO 2 management.

By their nature  such forward-looking statements are not guaranteeing future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties  and assumptions which might cause the actual results  financial condition  performance or achievements of UCB  or industry results  to be materially different from any future results  performance  or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this press release.Important factors that could result in such differences include but are not limited to: global spread and impacts of wars and pandemics  changes in general economic  business and competitive conditions  the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing  costs associated with research and development  changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB  effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations  safety  quality  data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches  or disruptions of our information technology systems  product liability claims  challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates  competition from other products including biosimilars  changes in laws or regulations  exchange rate fluctuations  changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws  and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline  or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far  the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models  cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB's efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also  UCB or others could discover safety  side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB's products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover  sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment  including pricing pressure  political and public scrutiny  customer and prescriber patterns or practices  and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes.

The robust commercial development in 2023  following strong revenue growth in 2022 (+32%)  illustrates the current volatility in a changing and complex environment. The Group  in a buoyant geopolitical context for its activities  rolled out some significant changes in 2023. It has effectively adapted thanks to the three core pillars from the strategic plan announced in July: (i) focusing the microdrone technological roadmap on Defense and Security  (ii) improving operations for the photogrammetry business  and (iii) stopping production in China and switching to South Korea  complementing the industrial organization already in place in the United States. Operating expenditure was reduced by more than €11m between the first half and second half of the year  in line with expectations  to reach  at the end of 2023  a level in line with the Group’s ambitions for development.While the interest in secure and autonomous microdrones is highlighted by the preponderance of new technologies in the current conflicts  Parrot is working to meet the technological and operational challenges faced to ensure the success of its new microdrone  a key driver for 2024.2023 full-year earningsThe consolidated and annual financial statements for the year ended December 31  2023 were approved by the Board of Directors on March 14  2024.

Revenues for professional microdrones came to €33.2m  compared with €39.2m in 2022 (-15%  and -14% at constant exchange rates). Photogrammetry revenues totaled €31.8m  compared with €32.7m (-3%  and -1% at constant exchange rates).In 2023  the Group recorded a gross margin of €47.0m  with a rate of 72.3%. This change (-5.5pts) reflects the product mix  with the growth in sales of third-party equipment (with lower margins than software) which aim to expand the addressable market for photogrammetry  and the provisions linked to the new industrial strategy and the launch of a new microdrone.The Group reduced its operating expenditure by -€11.2m (-26%) between the first half and second half of 2023. At end-December 2023  the Group’s workforce - permanent and fixed-term contracts - represented 404 people  compared with 542 at December 31  2022. 51% are deployed on microdrones and 49% on photogrammetry. In line with the progress with its technological roadmap  the Group limited its use of external providers (16 versus 44 at December 31  2022).Over the year  R&D  at -€45.5m was maintained to respond to the challenges involved with the new generations of products. Nevertheless  the completion of various development projects enabled the Group to reduce this area of spending by €6.7m (-26%) between the first half and second half of 2023. 62% of the Group’s workforce  based exclusively in Europe  are focused on innovation.Sales and marketing costs came to €12.3m for 2023  with a €1.7m (-24%) decrease between the first half and second half of 2023. They support an organization that generated 42% of its sales on the American continent  38% in Europe and 20% elsewhere around the world. This breakdown changed only slightly between 2022 and 2023.Administrative costs and overheads represent €11.7m for 2023  with a €2.5m (-35%) reduction between the first half and second half of 2023  thanks to the combined efforts of all of the Group’s business units.Production and quality costs totaled €4.7m in 2023  with a €0.3m (-12%) reduction between the first half and second half of 2023. This level is moderated by the non-recurring costs linked to the industrial organization’s transfer from China to South Korea.2023 current operating incomes came to -€27.3m. The microdrones business represented -€17.4m  including -€6.0m for the second half of the year. The photogrammetry business came to -€6.4m  with -€0.8m for the second half of the year. The other expenses (-€3.5m in 2023) are attributable to Parrot SA.The -€2.8m of other operating income and expenses for 2023 include the reorganization costs for -€6.3m  in line with the estimates published in July 2023  partially offset by the +€3.4m of income generated by the disposal of a minority interest.Change in the cash positionThe Group had €28.1m of net cash at end-December 2023 (compared with €44.8m at end-June 2023 and €68.5m at end-December 2022). The Group does not have any financial debt. Over the second half of the year  operational cash consumption was reduced to €16.9m  with €5.3m in relation with the strategic plan  partially offset by the research tax credit of €1.4m.Cash flow from operating activities totaled €40.7m  reflecting the resources allocated to operations and the increase in working capital requirements (+€11.0m  including +€9.6m in H1 2023)  linked primarily to the strategic plan and particularly the new industrial organization and the finalization of a new generation of microdrones.Cash flow from investment activities came to €4.5m in 2023. Parrot sold its interest in the company Sky-Hero  receiving €5.5m  which offset the €0.9m of investments made in 2023.Cash flow from financing activities came to €4.4m  including €2.5m for the repayment of lease liabilities with the application of IFRS 16 and €1.5m of capital investments in two minority interests.OutlookWhile the interest in secure and autonomous microdrones is highlighted by the preponderance of new technologies in the current conflicts  Parrot is working to meet the technological and operational challenges faced to ensure the success of its new microdrone  which is driving trends in 2024.In the photogrammetry sector  the expansion of the addressable market  capitalizing in particular on complementary equipment  is a key area for growth  as in 2023.Efficient implementation of the strategic plan  coupled with rigorous management of operations and investments  ensure that the Group has the financial capacity to pursue its development ambitions.Next financial date2024 first-quarter revenues: Thursday May 16  2024ABOUT THE PARROT GROUPParrot is Europe's leading commercial microUAV group.
