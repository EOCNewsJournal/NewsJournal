Of that sum  the Brussels-based clearinghouse Euroclear holds around €191 billion ($205 billion)  which has accrued nearly €4.4 billion in interest over the past year.Speaking at a joint press conference with French President Emmanuel Macron and Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk in Berlin on Friday  Chancellor Scholz said: “We will use windfall profits from Russian assets frozen in Europe to financially support the purchase of weapons for Ukraine.”The German leader also announced plans to establish a “new capability coalition for long-range rocket artillery ” with procurement to take place “on the overall world market.”The German chancellor did not provide specifics  and it remains unclear whether he was referring to an entirely new initiative  or to a “long-range” scheme announced by President Macron in February.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen last month suggested using the interest from frozen Russian assets to buy weapons for Ukraine. However  Politico  citing an anonymous EU official  reported on Thursday that Malta  Luxembourg and Hungary had “expressed reservations” about the plan earlier this week.Moscow has repeatedly warned that any actions taken against its assets would amount to “theft.” It has stressed that seizing the funds or any similar move would violate international law and undermine Western currencies  the global financial system  and the world economy.,neutral,0.05,0.68,0.26,negative,0.02,0.31,0.67,True,English,"['Russian assets', 'EU', 'arms', 'Ukraine', 'Scholz', 'Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk', 'President Ursula von der Leyen', 'French President Emmanuel Macron', 'German Chancellor Olaf Scholz', 'Brussels-based clearinghouse Euroclear', 'joint press conference', 'global financial system', 'Russian Central Bank', 'new capability coalition', 'long-range rocket artillery', 'overall world market', 'anonymous EU official', 'frozen Russian assets', 'President Macron', 'Chancellor Scholz', 'German leader', 'new initiative', 'long-range” scheme', 'world economy', 'military operation', 'Western countries', 'past year', 'European Commission', 'similar move', 'international law', 'Western currencies', 'windfall profits', 'Moscow', 'funds', 'Kiev', 'interest', 'weapons', 'Ukraine', 'February', 'sum', 'Berlin', 'Friday', 'purchase', 'plans', 'procurement', 'place', 'specifics', 'Politico', 'Thursday', 'Malta', 'Luxembourg', 'Hungary', 'reservations', 'actions']",2024-03-16,2024-03-17,rt.com

Scholz’s announcement on Friday comes after the US and the UK have put repeated pressure on some EU countries to agree to using the stolen assets as a way to fund Ukraine.While this is the first time that Berlin has voiced support for the idea  about a week prior UK foreign secretary David Cameron said the UK was prepared to loan Ukraine all frozen Russian central bank assets in the state based on the believe that Ukraine would pay those loans back with Russian “reparations” following the end of the war.But Germany  France and Italy still oppose completely confiscating the assets  because they believe it will weaken international confidence in the euro  and they have legal concerns about the validity of such an act. But even though the assets are frozen  they have matured and been reinvested  generating profits that EU officials say could reach 15 billion euros ($16 billion) over the next four years  the report claims.The EU has agreed to order financial institutions to separate the profits from the Russian assets into a different account. But EU officials will not make a second proposal to transfer the money to EU or national coffers until the bloc has enough support from other states. The proposal is expected to come as soon as next week  the report adds.Of the roughly $282 billion in Russian assets immobilized in Japan and the West  around $207 billion (€191 billion) are held at Euroclear  a clearinghouse based in Belgium.Russia has maintained that they will take retaliatory measures in response to any theft of their assets. Euroclear is already facing 50 and 100 lawsuits in Russian courts over the frozen assets. Finance Minister Anton Siluanov told Sputnik in late February that any theft of frozen assets will trigger a symmetrical response.https://sputnikglobe.com/20240307/delusional-david-cameron-wants-to-steal-russian-assets-as-surety-to-bail-out-ukraine-1117197220.htmlhttps://sputnikglobe.com/20240313/theft-of-frozen-russian-assets-may-lead-to-financial-crisis-in-the-west-1117312032.htmlukraineunited kingdom (uk)russiaSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rosiya Segodnya“ 252 602024Mary Manley https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e6/01/0b/1092187887_0:0:2048:2049_100x100_80_0_0_0c2cc4c84f89aff034cc55bb01fb6697.jpgMary Manley https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e6/01/0b/1092187887_0:0:2048:2049_100x100_80_0_0_0c2cc4c84f89aff034cc55bb01fb6697.jpgNewsen_ENSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rosiya Segodnya“ 252 601920 1080 true1920 1440 true1920 1920 trueSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rosiya Segodnya“ 252 60Mary Manley https://cdn1.img.sputnikglobe.com/img/07e6/01/0b/1092187887_0:0:2048:2049_100x100_80_0_0_0c2cc4c84f89aff034cc55bb01fb6697.jpgfrozen assets  european union (eu)  ukraine  olaf scholz  united kingdom (uk)  western sanctions against russia  russian economy  russian economy under sanctions  david cameron  stealing  theft  ukrainian conflict  ukrainian crisis  ukraine crisis  western sanctions  russia,neutral,0.07,0.91,0.02,negative,0.03,0.32,0.65,True,English,"['Frozen Russian Assets', 'Ukrainian Arms', 'Germany', 'Scholz', 'Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk', 'UK foreign secretary David Cameron', 'Finance Minister Anton Siluanov', 'New York City journal', 'French President Emmanual Macron', 'ukraine olaf scholz united kingdom', 'German Chancellor Olaf Scholz', 'Russian central bank assets', 'next four years', 'ukraine united kingdom', 'Frozen Russian Assets', 'assets european union', 'frozen assets', 'next week', 'russian economy', 'Russian “reparations', 'Russian courts', 'European countries', 'a year', 'weapon purchases', 'first time', 'international confidence', 'legal concerns', '15 billion euros', 'financial institutions', 'different account', 'national coffers', 'other states', 'retaliatory measures', 'late February', 'Rosiya Segodnya', 'Mary Manley', 'ukrainian conflict', 'ukrainian crisis', 'Sputnik International', 'EU countries', 'EU officials', 'The EU', 'ukraine crisis', 'Ukrainian Arms', 'western sanctions', 'second proposal', 'enough support', 'symmetrical response', 'cdn1.img', 'The West', 'windfall profits', 'recent report', 'sputnikglobe', 'berlin', 'frozen-russian-assets', 'ukrainian-arms', 'Germany', 'way', 'money', 'world', 'c1ab042df5ae8cbbbeeef552557dd67c', 'Friday', 'reporters', 'announcement', 'repeated', 'pressure', 'idea', 'believe', 'loans', 'end', 'war', 'France', 'Italy', 'validity', 'act', 'bloc', 'Japan', 'Euroclear', 'clearinghouse', 'Belgium', 'theft', '100 lawsuits', 'delusional-david-cameron', 'steal', 'financial-crisis', 'sputniknews', 'MIA', '0c2cc4c84f89aff034cc55bb01fb6697', '50']",2024-03-16,2024-03-17,sputnikglobe.com
