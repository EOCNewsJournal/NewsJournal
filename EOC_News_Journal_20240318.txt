YoitsAltria is selling off part of its 10% stake in Anheuser-Busch InBev  valued at about $2.2 billion.The tobacco giant said it would use the proceeds to purchase its own shares.Anheuser-Busch InBev has been hurt by the loss of Bud Light sales related to the boycott over the beer maker's relationship with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney.American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) of Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD) slumped more than 5% Thursday after Altria (MO) slashed part of its 10% stake in the beer maker at a discounted price.Altria announced that it would be selling 35 million of its 195 million ABI shares—AB InBev shares traded on the Euronext exchange—through a global secondary offering. The tobacco giant explained that the sale would be composed of public offerings of ADRs and ABI ordinary shares in the U.S.  as well as a concurrent private placement of ABI ordinary shares in the European Economic Area and the U.K.AB InBev explained the shares would be priced at EUR56.17 ($61.26) per ordinary share  and $61.50 per ADR. That would be about 5% below Wednesday's closing price in the U.S. of $64.55. The beer maker added that it plans to buy 3.34 million ordinary shares for $200 million.2The move would raise about $2.2 billion for Altria. The company noted that it expects to use the cash generated to buy back its own shares.A year ago  AB InBev shares plunged after a boycott of its Bud Light brand sparked by the company's work with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney. Soon thereafter  Bud Light lost its title as best-selling U.S. beer brand to Constellation Brands’ (STZ) Modelo Especial. Sales of Bud Light have yet to recover  although AB InBev’s overall revenue in 2023 was up 7.8%.(Excerpt) Read more at investopedia.com ...TOPICS:Business/EconomyCulture/SocietyNews/Current EventsKEYWORDS:altriainbevlightstockClick here: to donate by Credit Card Or here: to donate by PayPal Or by mail to: Free Republic  LLC - PO Box 9771 - Fresno  CA 93794 Thank you very much and God bless you.If I understand this  Altria's stock in Transheuser Busch / AB/Inbev has dropped to half it's value and Altria is selling off 17% of their AB InBev stock in order to take the money and buy back Altria stock to keep that from dropping. Altria had received 185 million shares in AB InBev back in October 2016 when SABMiller was acquired by AB InBev since Altria had a stake in SABMiller. Altria purchased 12 million more shares the same month  taking its holdings in AB InBev to 197 million. At the time  AB InBev stock was valued at $127 per share (197M shares at $127 per share = $25B). The stock is now trading at roughly $62 per share. Don't let anyone tell you boycotts don't work (yes  I know  this isn't a boycott  it's a complete walking-away). Transheuser-Busch spit in the faces of their customers in order to push perversion. One can now better understand the desperation of Transheuser Busch trying to pay endorsers such as Joe Rogan  Emmitt Smith  Payton Manning  and Dana White. Too late  no refunds.To: T.B.

YoitsSince the Dylan debacle  AB stock is worth about 8% less  factoring in the 2023 dividend. During that same period  the S&P 500 is up 24%. That is some serious lagging on AB’s part.

So ANYTHING that might compromise shareholder value  such as making the face of our brand being a tranny when our customers are REAL MEN  would have to be FULLY JUSTIFIED. ...but maybe it is justified? For example  is Blackrock threatening to sell off their holdings if they continue to use normal people? If so  they need to DISCLOSE just that and make the case that the tranny appeared to be the lesser of two evils.

This project  led by Lhyfe for over two years  has been approved by the European Commission as part of the third wave of IPCEI (Important Projects of Common European Interest) on hydrogen.During its visit today to Le Havre for the 7th ""Rencontres de l'Axe Seine""  Roland Lescure  French Delegate Minister for Industry and Energy  confirmed the French government's support of up to €149 million for Lhyfe's project  at the heart of Le Havre's low-carbon industrial zone.With this project  Lhyfe intends to produce up to 34 tonnes of green hydrogen per day near the Grand Canal du Havre  one of Europe's largest industrial port areas. This support from the French government confirms Lhyfe's status as a key player in the renewable hydrogen industry  and its confidence in the know-how and expertise of Lhyfe's teams  pioneers in the industry.The site is close to the Yara plant in Le Havre  whose decarbonization roadmap includes the use of green hydrogen. Yara is interested in and supports Lhyfe's project  and will explore with Lhyfe all possible collaborations to decarbonize its industrial process.The Lhyfe production site  to be located on a 2.8-hectare plot of land in Gonfreville-l'Orcher  is scheduled to be operational by 2028.For Matthieu Guesné  Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Lhyfe: “We are honored by the government's significant support for Lhyfe's project to build the future green hydrogen production site at Gonfreville-L'Orcher  which is a concrete expression of the decarbonization policy France has been pursuing for several years. This announcement is a mark of confidence in Lhyfe and its expertise  and a true recognition of the work accomplished. This project meets the challenges of the industrial port zone of Le Havre: a 100 MW site  capable of producing up to 34 tonnes of decarbonated hydrogen per day. It is towards this greener horizon that this plant is leading us!
