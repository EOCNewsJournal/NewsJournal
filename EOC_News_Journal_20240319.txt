Then this plan is for you.""I hope today an agreement will finally be reached "" he added  speaking ahead of a monthly foreign ministers' meeting.Borrell's optimism came after German chancellor Olaf Scholz also announced in Berlin on Friday: ""We will use windfall profits from Russian assets frozen in Europe to financially support the purchase of weapons for Ukraine"".EU countries have frozen some €210bn of Russian assets since the war began.Belgian financial firm Euroclear holds €191bn of them  generating extraordinary or ""windfall"" revenues of €4.4bn last year — the kind of money that would be skimmed off to pay for Ukraine arms in future under the EU plan.And some EU states  such as Estonia  want the EU to seize Russian capital as well  even if it sparks legal retaliation against EU assets held abroad.""This would show [Russian president Vladimir] Putin and the oligarchs we can take away their frozen assets "" said Estonian foreign minister Markus Tsahkna on Monday.""It would also be an important message to our taxpayers — that it's the aggressor who bears the cost "" he added.EU ministers will also agree to blacklist 35 Russians involved in the killing of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny in February on Monday.And they will start talks on the 14th round of Ukraine-war linked Russia sanctions  as well as on a new legal tool to blacklist Russian human-rights abusers in future.""Manganese ore imported by Russia goes especially to military industries to make high-quality steel.

The Programme is aimed at the CEO  members of the Group Management  General Managers and certain other key employees in the Boliden Group and shall be implemented after Boliden's Annual General Meeting in 2024.The overall purpose of the Programme is to maintain a close community of interest between employees and shareholders by incentivizing employees to increase the value of the company. The Programme is intended to attract and retain key employees. The Programme should be achievable  easy to understand  cost-effective to administer and easy to communicate.a) Implementation of the ProgrammeThe Board of Directors proposes to implement the Programme on the main terms set out below.The Programme is proposed to be directed to 40 permanent employees within the Boliden Group  which are divided into the following four categories: the CEO of Boliden (""Group 1"")  members of the Group Management (currently four persons) (""Group 2"")  General Managers (currently eleven persons) (""Group 3"") and 24 other pre-identified key persons in the Boliden Group (""Group 4""). The participants in Groups 1-4 are together referred to as the ""Participants"". In order to participate in the Programme  the employees are required to personally invest in shares in Boliden  and that these shares are allocated to the Programme  or that shares already held in Boliden are allocated to the Programme[1]  no later than 30 September 2024  unless the Board of Directors decides to postpone the date (""Investment Shares""). The Investment Shares shall be retained throughout the Vesting Period (as defined below). For each Investment Share  the Participants have the possibility to  free of charge  either by Boliden  by another company in the Boliden Group or by a designated third party  be allotted a maximum of three (3) shares in Boliden conditional upon continued employment and uninterrupted holding of Investment Shares and fulfilment of certain performance conditions (as further described in section (d) below) (""Performance Shares""). The Performance Shares will be granted after the expiry of a vesting period  which runs from and including 1 June 2024 up to and including 31 May 2027 (the ""Vesting Period""). The allotment of Performance Shares shall be dependent on the extent to which the performance conditions for the Programme have been fulfilled. The performance conditions shall consist of a financial target specific to the Programme related to the total shareholder return (""TSR"") for Boliden's share (the ""TSR Condition"") and a sustainability target (the ""Sustainability Condition"")  as further described below. The TSR Condition will be weighted with 80 per cent and the Sustainability Condition with 20 per cent when determining the allotment of Performance Shares. After the end of the Vesting Period  the Board of Directors will publish the extent to which the TSR Condition and the Sustainability Condition have been fulfilled.The TSR Condition shall be related to the TSR of Boliden's share during a period of 20 trading days after Boliden's publication of the year-end report for the financial year 2023 compared to 20 trading days after Boliden's publication of the year-end report for the financial year 2026 (the ""Measurement Period"") in relation to the TSR of a peer group of other companies.[2]A condition for allotment of Performance Shares under the TSR Condition is that the TSR for Boliden's share exceeds the weighted TSR outcome for the peer group during the Measurement Period (the ""TSR Minimum Level""). If the TSR Minimum Level is not achieved  no allotment of Performance Shares related to the TSR Condition will be made. For maximum allotment (100 per cent)  the TSR for Boliden's share must exceed the weighted TSR outcome for the peer group by at least 12.5 percentage points during the Measurement Period (the ""TSR Maximum Level""). If the TSR for Boliden's share amounts to between the TSR Minimum Level and the TSR Maximum Level during the Measurement Period  a linear allocation is made.The Sustainability Condition shall be related to the reduction of Boliden's carbon dioxide emissions in absolute terms. A condition for allotment of Performance Shares under the Sustainability Condition is that Boliden's carbon dioxide emissions in absolute terms (Scope 1 and Scope 2 according to the Green-house Gas Protocol) during the financial year 2026 have been reduced by at least 15 per cent compared to Boliden's carbon dioxide emissions in absolute terms during the financial year 2021.[3] Participants in Group 1-2 may invest in Investment Shares at a value corresponding to a maximum of 15 per cent of the Participant's annual gross fixed base salary for 2023  adjusted for the increase in the income base amount in Sweden for 2024 compared to 2023. Participants in Group 3-4 may invest in Investment Shares at a value corresponding to a maximum of 10 per cent of the Participant's annual gross fixed base salary for 2023  adjusted for the increase in the income base amount in Sweden for 2024 compared to 2023. The number of Investment Shares that Participants may acquire is determined on the basis of the volume-weighted average share price of the Boliden share during a period of 20 trading days after Boliden's publication of the year-end report for the financial year 2023. Performance Shares may normally only be allotted after the end of the Vesting Period. The total value of Performance Shares allotted to Participants may not exceed 150 per cent of the Participant's annual individual gross fixed base salary for 2027 (the ""Cap""). The value of the Performance Shares for calculation of the Cap is determined based on the volume weighted average share price of the Boliden share during a period of 20 trading days prior to the end of the Vesting Period. For a Participant to be allotted Performance Shares  it shall normally have been a permanent employee within the Boliden Group during the entire Vesting Period  and have retained the Investment Shares until the end of the Vesting Period. Investment Shares disposed of before the end of the Vesting Period shall not be included in the calculation for determining the allotment of Performance Shares. If there are significant changes in the Boliden Group or in the market which  in the opinion of the Board of Directors  would mean that the conditions for allotment of Performance Shares under the Programme are no longer reasonable  the Board of Directors shall be entitled to make adjustments to the Programme  including  inter alia  a right to resolve on a reduced allotment of Performance Shares  or that no allotment of Performance Shares shall take place at all. The Board of Directors shall be entitled to decide on the detailed terms and conditions of the Programme. In this respect  the Board of Directors shall be entitled to make necessary adjustments to these terms and conditions in order to fulfil specific rules or market conditions outside Sweden. Participation in the Programme is contingent upon such participation being legal in the relevant jurisdictions. Where  in the Board's opinion  Participants outside Sweden cannot be allotted Performance Shares at a reasonable cost or with reasonable administrative efforts  it shall be entitled to decide on a cash settlement for such Participants. The Programme shall comprise a maximum of 100 000 Performance Shares in Boliden. The number of Performance Shares shall be subject to recalculation to take into account any intervening bonus issues  splits  rights issues  dividend exceeding 15 per cent of the Group's equity for a given financial year and/or other similar corporate events.Costs of the Programme  etc.The costs for the Programme  which are recognized in the income statement  are calculated in accordance with the accounting standard IFRS 2 and are accrued over the Vesting Period. The calculation has been carried out based on the quoted closing price for shares in Boliden as of 29 December 2023  i.e. SEK 314.5 per share  and with the following assumptions: (i) an annual employee turnover of approximately 7 per cent  (ii) fulfilment of the TSR Condition of 100 per cent and fulfilment of the Sustainability Condition  (iii) all 40 Participants invest the maximum amount in the Programme  (iv) all remaining Participants are entitled to allotment of the maximum number of Performance Shares in the Programme  (v) a tax rate for social security contributions of 30 per cent under the Programme  and (vi) a total maximum of 100 000 Performance Shares available for allotment.Based on the above assumptions  the total costs for the Programme under IFRS 2 are estimated to amount to approximately SEK 17.1 million  excluding social security contributions. Assuming an annual share price increase of 15 per cent during the term of the Programme  the costs for social security contributions are estimated to amount to approximately SEK 11 million. Assuming instead an annual share price increase of 30 per cent during the duration of the Programme  the costs for social security contributions are estimated to amount to approximately SEK 15.9 million.Based on the above assumptions (and an annual share price increase of 15 per cent for calculation of the social security contributions)  the yearly costs are estimated to amount to approximately SEK 9.4 million  including social security contributions. This corresponds to approximately 0.2 per cent of the Boliden Group's total personnel costs for the financial year 2023.DilutionThe allotment of repurchased shares to fulfil the obligations under the Programme would result in the following dilution effects (under the assumptions stated below). At the maximum allotment of Performance Shares  the number of shares to be allotted free of charge in the Programme amounts to 100 000 shares in Boliden  which corresponds to approximately 0.04 per cent of the shares and votes (calculated based on the number of outstanding shares in Boliden as of 29 December 2023). The effects on key ratios and earnings per share are thus insignificant.Hedging arrangementsIn order to be able to implement the Programme in a cost-efficient and flexible manner  the Board of Directors has considered different methods for delivery of Performance Shares. The Board of Directors has thereby found the most cost-efficient alternative to be  and therefore proposes that the Annual General Meeting as the main alternative resolves on  repurchase and transfer of treasury shares. The Company currently holds 40 000 treasury shares. The detailed terms and conditions for the Board of Directors' main alternative are set out in section 21.b.i below.Should the required majority for item 21.b.i below not be reached  the Board of Directors proposes that Boliden shall be able to enter into equity swap agreements with third parties in accordance with item 21.b.ii below.Preparation of the proposalThe proposed Programme has  according to guidelines issued by Boliden's Board of Directors  been prepared by Boliden's Remuneration Committee  with the assistance of external advisors. The Remuneration Committee has presented the work to the Board of Directors  after which the Board of Directors has resolved to propose that the Programme is adopted at the Annual General Meeting 2024.-------------------b) Hedging arrangements in respect of the Programmei. Decisions on acquisitions and transfers of treasury sharesThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting (a) authorize the Board of Directors to resolve on acquisitions of treasury shares on Nasdaq Stockholm and (b) resolve that treasury shares may be transferred to the Participants in the Programme.a. The acquisition of treasury shares is subject to the following terms:Purchases of treasury shares may only be made on Nasdaq Stockholm. A maximum of 100 000 shares may be acquired to ensure delivery of shares to Participants. Acquisitions of shares in Boliden on Nasdaq Stockholm may only be made at a price within the price interval applicable from time to time on Nasdaq Stockholm  i.e. the interval between the highest buying price and the lowest selling price on Nasdaq Stockholm from time to time. The authorization may be exercised on one or more occasions until the Annual General Meeting in 2025.b. The transfer of Boliden's treasury shares to the Participants may take place under the following terms:A maximum of 100 000 shares in Boliden may be transferred free of charge to the Participants. The right to acquire shares in Boliden free of charge shall  with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  be granted to the Participants  with a right for each Participant to acquire a maximum number of shares in accordance with the terms of the Programme. Furthermore  with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  subsidiaries of Boliden shall be entitled to acquire shares in Boliden free of charge  whereby such company shall be obliged to  according to the terms of the Programme  immediately transfer the shares to the Participants. Transfers of shares in Boliden shall be made free of charge at the time and on the other terms and conditions that apply for allocation of shares to the Participants. The number of shares in Boliden that may be transferred under the Programme shall be subject to recalculation to take into account any intervening bonus issues  splits  rights issues  dividend exceeding 15 per cent of the Group's equity for a given financial year and/or other similar corporate events.The transfer of own shares is part of the proposed Programme and the Board of Directors considers it to be beneficial to Boliden and the shareholders that Participants in the Programme are offered the opportunity to become shareholders under the terms of the Programme.ii. Equity swap agreement with a third partyThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting  in the event that the required majority for item 21.b.i above cannot be reached  resolve to hedge the financial exposure that the Programme is expected to entail by enabling Boliden to enter into an equity swap agreement with a third party on terms in accordance with market practice  whereby the third party undertakes  in its own name and in exchange for a fee  to acquire and transfer shares in Boliden to the Participants in accordance with the terms of the Programme.Majority requirements  etc.The Annual General Meeting's resolution to implement the Programme in accordance with item 21.a. above is conditional upon the Annual General Meeting resolving either in accordance with the proposal under item 21.b.i or the proposal under item 21.b.ii.The Annual General Meeting's resolution under item 21.a above requires a simple majority of the votes cast. A valid resolution under item 21.b.i above requires that shareholders representing not less than nine-tenths of the votes cast as well as of the shares represented at the Annual General Meeting approve the resolution. A valid resolution under item 21.b.ii above requires a simple majority of the votes cast.Previous incentive programmesSince 2023  Boliden has a long-term share saving programme (LTIP 2023/2026) which is mainly based on the same conditions as the above proposed LTIP 2024/2027.

37659,Euroclear,Bing API,https://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2024-03-19-eu-drafts-law-to-send-russian-central-bank-profits-to-ukraine/,EU drafts law to send Russian central bank profits to Ukraine,The European Union has prepared legislation that would see Ukraine start to receive profits generated by frozen Russian sovereign assets as early as July.,A woman holding a placard depicting (from left) Adolf Hitler  Russian President Putin and Joseph Stalin protests in front of the Russian Embassy in Chisinau  during Russia presidential elections  in Moldova  17 March 2024. The EU has drafted a law to send Russian central bank profits to Ukraine. (Photo: EPA-EFE/DUMITRU DORU)The proposals  which require the backing of all member states  would apply a windfall tax on profits generated by the immobilised reserves  aiming to use an estimated €3-billion ($3.3-billion) a year to fund the supply of weapons to Ukraine and boost the country’s defense industry  according to draft documents seen by Bloomberg News.About €260-billion in assets of the Russian central bank  mostly in the form of securities and cash  have been immobilised by G7 nations  the EU and Australia with more than two thirds of those blocked in the EU.The funding has become especially critical as Ukraine faces a shortage of artillery and some $60-billion of US assistance remains blocked in Congress.The Biden administration has been pushing G7 allies to seize the frozen assets outright and wants to see progress before a leaders’ summit in June  Bloomberg previously reported. But several European nations  including Germany and France  as well as the European Central Bank are reluctant.Under the EU’s proposal  a share yet to be determined of the proceeds generated since Feb. 15 would be transferred to the EU bi-annually until sanctions are lifted. The funds would be initially allocated to the European Peace Facility  the bloc’s mechanism to reimburse weapons delivered to Kyiv  and to the EU budget’s Ukraine facility.A share of the profits would remain with the central securities depositories holding the reserves to cover the costs of managing the assets and deal with any risks  including potential retaliation by Russia. Relevant expenses and corporation tax would also be deducted from the revenues before they are transferred. That would leave about €3-billion in net profits per year  according to some estimates.The vast majority of the funds has been frozen through the Belgium-based clearing house Euroclear where they generated about €4.4-billion in profits last year.Profits transferProfits generated in the past would be provisionally retained before being transferred to the EU within five years at the earliest  the draft proposals say.Should risks materialise  “unexpected and extraordinary revenues generated by the central securities depository prior to 15 February 2024 should be used first to cover the corresponding expenses ” one of the documents says. “Modalities should be established for the transfer to the Union of amounts provisionally retained when they are not anymore necessary.”The proposals will be discussed by EU leaders when they meet in Brussels later this week.Poland’s Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski told reporters after a meeting with his EU counterparts in Brussels on Monday that they’d made “a political decision  although not a legal one” to tap the windfall profits.Josep Borrell  the EU’s foreign affairs chief  told reporters: “I cannot say there was unanimity  but a strong consensus to take this decision.” He added that some member states want more details.However  several member states have been reluctant to back using the funds to provide Ukraine with military support  a split that risks delaying progress  according to people familiar with the matter.Central securities depositories holding more than €1-million in frozen reserves and assets had been previously asked by the EU to set revenues generated aside  set up separate accounting procedures and were also prohibited from using the unexpected and extraordinary profits they’d generated. Those same institutions would be asked to provide the EU with regular reports as part of the bloc’s proposals.,neutral,0.09,0.8,0.11,negative,0.02,0.25,0.72,True,English,"['Russian central bank profits', 'EU', 'law', 'Ukraine', 'Belgium-based clearing house Euroclear', 'Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski', 'Russian central bank profits', 'European Central Bank', 'foreign affairs chief', 'Russian President Putin', 'separate accounting procedures', 'central securities depositories', 'central securities depository', 'several European nations', 'European Peace Facility', 'Russia presidential elections', 'The Biden administration', 'several member states', 'Russian Embassy', 'G7 nations', 'Adolf Hitler', 'Joseph Stalin', 'EPA-EFE/DUMITRU DORU', 'windfall tax', 'defense industry', 'two thirds', 'US assistance', 'G7 allies', 'leaders’ summit', 'potential retaliation', 'Relevant expenses', 'corporation tax', 'vast majority', 'five years', 'corresponding expenses', 'legal one', 'Josep Borrell', 'strong consensus', 'military support', 'same institutions', 'regular reports', 'net profits', 'windfall profits', 'extraordinary profits', 'Ukraine facility', 'draft documents', 'Bloomberg News', 'political decision', 'extraordinary revenues', 'Profits transfer', 'EU budget', 'draft proposals', 'EU leaders', 'EU counterparts', 'woman', 'placard', 'left', 'protests', 'front', 'Chisinau', 'Moldova', 'Photo', 'backing', 'reserves', 'supply', 'weapons', 'country', 'billion', 'assets', 'form', 'cash', 'Australia', 'funding', 'shortage', 'artillery', 'Congress', 'progress', 'June', 'Germany', 'France', 'share', 'proceeds', 'Feb.', 'sanctions', 'funds', 'bloc', 'mechanism', 'Kyiv', 'costs', 'risks', 'estimates', 'past', 'unexpected', '15 February', 'Modalities', 'Union', 'amounts', 'Brussels', 'Poland', 'reporters', 'meeting', 'Monday', 'unanimity', 'details', 'split', 'people', 'matter']",2024-03-19,2024-03-19,dailymaverick.co.za

Traders say large short positions built up by investors make the market liable to short-covering rallies.""The price move is directly linked to the rebound in Chicago "" a futures dealer said.

Guided by this research  Sofitel will be deploying new experience rituals across all its hotels to help guests enjoy blissful nights.Sleep has always been one of Sofitel’s focus. In 2003  the brand unveiled a major innovation: the Sofitel MyBed experience  the epitome of comfort. A box spring  mattress  topper  comforter and an extensive selection of pillows  developed with the utmost care to deliver unmatched comfort and the sensation of being cradled in clouds.Sofitel has now taken its commitment to slumber a step further by conducting a scientific study to analyze its guests’ sleep. The aim was to better understand how travelers sleep in order to help them sleep better and longer. The study was designed to minimize the notorious “first night effect ” which occurs when people sleep far away from home.Studying the “first night effect”This effect is also known as a syndrome. When we sleep in an unfamiliar place for the first time  the left hemisphere of our brain displays heightened activity  which keeps it in a state of alert even after we have closed our eyes. This is a widespread issue for Sofitel as its diverse clientele includes many people who come for short stays: whether they were visiting for a business trip or enjoying a city break  in 2023  45% of Sofitel’s guests spent only one night in the brand’s hotels. Such guests are especially prone to the first night effect. This inspired Sofitel to design an original  first full-scale study to analyze these sleep issues  in collaboration with leading sleep experts.The subjects close their eyes and surrender to the processOne by one  a sample group of subjects agreed to participate in this study (which was published in the Journal o f Sleep Disorders & Therapy) and conducted in two phases. The first phase was to analyze their sleep at home to get a baseline measurement of its quality. In the sec ond phase  the subjects were invited to spend one night in a specially fitted out room at the Sofitel Paris Arc de Triomphe. The study applied a holistic approach that took a host of variables into account: total darkness  a temperature set to 66 °F (19°C)  the neutralization of sounds and smells  the nu tritional value of the menu  hydration and breathing exercises. All the senses were studied through sleep sensors installed under the mattress. The objective was to deliver a sleep score out of 100 based on six factors: duration  depth  regularity  interruptions  time to fall asleep and the wake-up phase.65 minutes of sleep gainedOn average  the subjects’ sleep quality in the Sofitel Paris Arc de Triomphe room was 13.7% higher than at home—the higher the score  the better the sleep. The subjects of the study slept an average of 65 minutes longer. Their cardiac and respiratory rhythms were also analyzed. Respiratory rhythms were slower  a sign of deeper sleep. 32% of the subjects woke up after 8 a.m.  and 64% of the subjects fell asleep in under 30 minutes. These numbers were borne out in the positive feedback the subjects provided: more than 8 out of 10 of them rated the experience as “good” to “very good.” When the subjects were asked about the best parts of the experience  the mattress and the pillow were mentioned in 96% of the responses.This study was invaluable for Sofitel because it gave us key data on our guests’ sleep. In late 2023  we started brainstorming on how we could apply the findings to our hotels across the world. We sought to give all our hotels clear guidelines and the opportunity to revamp their rooms and suites  to elevate the experience of all our travelers in the most personalized way possible. Nicolas Gronier  VP Global Marketing SofitelThe most restorative sleepSleep has always been a top priority for Sofitel  and now  thanks to the study findings  the brand is putting it front and center in an entirely new experience: The Art of Sleep. This is a complete ritual designed to promote the most peaceful nights. It is a natural extension of the pioneering Sofitel MyBed program  which was launched in 2003.Since 2003  Sofitel has been pampering guests with its famous Sofitel MyBed pillow menu  from which they can choose the best option for them. The collection includes the Rêverie Douceur  a square pillow filled with soft feathers  and the Ergo Confort pillow  which offers support designed for reading and working in a semi-upright position. The Sofitel MyBed pillow menu is a tailored  thoughtful service that offers premium pillows to help create an inviting environment. To foster sleep  the brand keeps offering guests calming herbal tea to drink before bed.Drawing on the study findings  Sofitel is now preparing to take its commitment to sleep to the next level. Starting in July 2024  it will be phasing in new rituals in each of its hotels. The offerings include light meals formulated to help guests fall asleep quicker  bespoke treatment protocols  relaxing playlists curated specially for the brand’s hotels  and precise lighting and temperature adjustments.About Accor  a world-leading hospitality groupAccor is a world leading hospitality group consisting of more than 5 300 properties and 10 000 food and beverage venues throughout 110 countries.

Counterspy is a standalone product within Verimatrix's anti-piracy team  engineered to prevent video content theft  shield apps from attack  and provide ongoing piracy threat prediction  detection and response services.Counterspy goes beyond traditional methods to ensure top-tier security for media app subscribers  safeguarding content across various devices. It fills the gap in authentication created by the shift from operator-controlled set top box hardware to retail or app-based OTT clients  allowing operators to distribute content confidently while preventing piracy. With Counterspy  each app instance is authenticated and tied to a specific subscriber  ensuring transparency and control over access. By safeguarding the authentication token from theft or manipulation  Counterspy prevents abuse and ensures legitimate access to content  going above and beyond traditional DRM vendors.What makes Counterspy stand out:Unique Protection and Threat Detection from the Video Service Provider to the Consumer Device: Verimatrix Counterspy effortlessly brings security into the unmanaged consumer device via the video app  something that has been lacking since the explosion of OTT streaming services that use consumers’ own devices. Verimatrix combined the best of its anti-piracy technologies with its cybersecurity innovations to create a bold new approach to tackling the piracy problem – a breakthrough leap forward.AI/ML-Driven Real-Time Protection: Leveraging the latest in artificial intelligence and machine learning  Counterspy can quickly identify piracy signals and cybersecurity threats  allowing for the real-time deployment of countermeasures.Multi-Layered Security Approach: Counterspy builds on proven technologies such as DRM and watermarking  with a new generation of sophisticated app protection and piracy monitoring tools to detect suspicious activity. This allows video service providers to pinpoint suspicious behavior at its source – as it’s happening – to thwart bad actors without impacting the experience of legitimate service subscribers. By shielding the app  Counterspy also protects personal information and payment card details belonging to video service subscribers. This multi-layered approach to video content + app security  along with the ability to deploy real-time anti-piracy countermeasures  allows streaming operators to continuously evolve their response to emerging threats – staying one step ahead of the pirates.“With our release of Counterspy  Verimatrix is at the forefront of the innovation needed to fight today’s sophisticated pirates within a vastly connected content viewing ecosystem ” said Andrew Bear  head of anti-piracy business at Verimatrix. “Yesterday’s security approaches are no longer enough to protect both revenue and content. Counterspy enables streaming operators to immediately fight back against pirates that seek to use the latest and often unnoticed business-draining techniques. We see Counterspy as a giant leap forward for security in the M&E industry because it can be directly linked to millions of dollars in prevented piracy-related losses as well as notable operating cost savings.”For operators  Counterspy targets piracy and revenue leakage  enhances content security and app protections  and helps prevent the compromise of user data. A Verimatrix telco customer who deployed an early release version of Counterspy realized an OPEX savings of $300 000  and they prevented direct piracy losses of $21 million in one year. Counterspy's design for speedy and straightforward integration into streaming video clients allows operators to detect and efficiently counteract piracy directly at its source – serving as an ""autonomous security solution"" that stands in stark contrast to traditional methods.Counterspy is part of the Verimatrix Streamkeeper suite of security solutions and can be flexibly deployed alongside other Verimatrix technologies  including Multi-DRM and Watermarking.

Its ambition is two-fold: to raise awareness among young adults about the risks of overconsumption of alcohol  and to reduce harm at events through the distribution of water.The campaign  created in collaboration with the Buzzman agency and director Thomas Mailaender  aims to connect with GenZ audiences by adopting their own mindset  conveying an impactful and universal message. After a first and extremely successful campaign  present in over 60 countries globally both online and on-the-field  DRINK MORE WATER has gained over 400 million in reach across Instagram and Facebook  and over 9 million people on the field at festivals  carnivals  student gatherings and events.This second edition of DRINK MORE WATER has gone one step further  in a visually impactful and audacious way  harnessing the power of marketing to prevent alcohol abuse. The chosen messaging seeks to strengthen the role of water and its power to reduce alcohol harm within GenZ’s excessive behavioral patterns. The consequences of excessive drinking can be clearly seen in the use of images and videos of people overconsuming water  in the place of alcohol  to discourage anyone from arriving at this point of desperation for hydration and poor decision making as a result of alcohol consumption. The message is clear and simple: DRINK MORE WATER BEFORE WTF!And because impact is what really matters  Pernod Ricard aims at reaching 1 billion young adults digitally by the end of 2025.The campaign is accessible online through the site: Drink More Water (drinkmore-water.com).About Pernod RicardPernod Ricard is a worldwide leader in the spirits and wine industry  blending traditional craftsmanship  state-of-the-art brand-building  and global distribution technologies.

(NYSE: ACHR) today announced that Stellantis recently completed a series of open market purchases of ~8.3 million shares of Archer’s stock signaling Stellantis’ continued confidence in Archer’s plans to bring electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft to market beginning in 2025. Stellantis’ increased investment in Archer follows CEO Carlos Tavares’ recent visit to Archer’s headquarters and manufacturing facilities in Santa Clara  California.In January 2023  Stellantis announced that its goal was for Stellantis to mass produce Archer’s Midnight aircraft as its exclusive contract manufacturer thereby allowing Archer to strengthen its path to commercialization by helping it avoid hundreds of millions of dollars of spending. The construction on the first phase of Archer’s high-volume manufacturing facility in Georgia remains on track to be completed later this year. The first phase is a build out of ~350 000 square feet on a ~100 acre site designed to support production of up to 650 aircraft annually  which would make it one of the largest manufacturing facilities by volume in the aircraft industry.Archer’s Midnight aircraft is designed to be safe  sustainable  quiet and carry four passengers plus a pilot. Midnight is optimized for back-to-back short distance trips of around 20-50 miles  with a charging time of approximately 10 minutes in-between.“Archer has established itself as a market leader in the electrification of aviation and we believe that together we can usher in the next transportation revolution ” said Stellantis CEO Carlos Tavares. “This recent move by Stellantis signals our confidence in Archer’s team and the progress we see firsthand through our deep partnership.”“We are on the cusp of changing the way the world moves in the sky ” said Adam Goldstein  founder and CEO of Archer. “Archer and Stellantis are working side by side to realize a once-in-a-generation opportunity to redefine urban transportation and deliver tremendous value to the world’s cities and our shareholders.”Stellantis has been a strategic partner to Archer since 2020 through various collaboration initiatives  and as an investor since 2021. During this time  Archer has leveraged Stellantis’ deep manufacturing  supply chain  and design expertise in connection with Archer’s efforts to design  develop  and commercialize its eVTOL aircraft.# # #About StellantisStellantis N.V.

This result takes on even greater value when compared with the general market trend  which recorded a contraction in volumes shipped due to the reduced spending capacity of end consumers. For the first time in IWB history Adjusted EBITDA exceeded the threshold of €44 million with growth of 19% compared to the previous year. The bank net financial position improved from €122M to €96M. In 2023 we also worked to realize a new group's corporate structure  effective by January 1  2024  with a reduction to just two Italian operating companies. The objective is to have a lean and efficient group  able to promptly respond to the market  with quality and service  enhancing its people and assets. We have also invested in environmental sustainability  with two new photovoltaic plants which will allow self-productionof about 1/3 of the group's energy needs. The IWB group is today widely diversified: it exports to over 80 countries  is present in both off-trade and on-trade channels  sells directly to the final consumer with its own online platform  has its own brands that cover different price ranges. But we know that there is still a lot to do  many new customers to reach in every corner of the earth  new products and brands to develop  processes to make more efficient.

In the reference markets  IWB achieves its turnover mainly and increasingly with foreign customers due to its own historical attitude and to the determination and intuition to seize relevant growth opportunities  which are confirmed mainly outside Italy; also driven by the long wave of an emerging international customers aware of and eager for a lifestyle that embraces the consumption of renowned excellences such as Italian wine  in a wide range of unique  quality and accessible references. In fact  the revenues highlight a further strengthening of the Group on international markets  where sales amounted to Euro 361.5 million (+1.7% compared to 2022 pro-forma revenues). The increase was obtained as a result of further penetration both on the reference markets and in new geographical areas  confirming that  even in an unfavorable market context  IWB is recognized as a reference partner for (i) quality and the breadth of its product portfolio (ii) the solid widespread presence on the market (iii) the quality and reliability of the services in particular from Wholesale and Ho.re.ca customers. €thousand 31.12.2023 31.12.2022 31.12.2021 31.12.2021 ∆ % 22 pf / Cagr 21 pf / pro-forma pro-forma 23 23 Total Revenues from sales 429 127 430 312 408 934 313 227 (0.28%) 2.44% Revenues from sales - Italy 67 380 73 521 75 681 57 597 (8.35%) (5.64%) Revenues from sales - Foreign markets 361 500 355 356 332 342 254 719 1.73% 4.29% Other Revenues 247 1 436 910 910 (82.79%) (47.90%) In a complex market  where the export of Italian wines recorded a decrease of 4.4% in volume and 7.3% in value  the Group's commercial strength and production capacity  which have progressively grown also thanks to acquisitions have guaranteed greater geographical diversification of revenues  contributing to the strengthening of the Group in key countries such as the UK (+3.22% CAGR 21PF/23)  Germany (+4% CAGR 21PF/23) and in particular in the United States  the first destination market for Italian wine abroad where the Group achieved a 21PF/23 CAGR of +28.2% and which prospectively represents one of the main growth drivers.

The revenues confirm the effectiveness of IWB's strategic choices which  thanks to (i) a strong positioning on all sales channels (ii) an integrated and international commercial team (iii) a brand/product portfolio able to satisfy diversified needs of customers let not only to maintain but to improve its market positioning and its customer base in a macroeconomic and sector context still characterized by high inflation and uncertainty in consumption. €thousand 31.12.2023 31.12.2022 31.12.2021 31.12.2021 ∆ % 22 pf / Cagr 21 pf / pro-forma pro-forma 23 23 Total Revenues from sales 429 127 430 312 408 934 313 227 (0.28%) 2.44% Revenues from wholesale division 311 845 303 471 299 379 212 078 2.76% 2.06% Revenues from distance selling division 62 257 68 545 82 706 82 671 (9.17%) (13.24%) Direct Mailing 30 426 34 539 43 701 43 701 (11.91%) (16.56%) Teleselling 12 155 13 902 16 806 16 806 (12.57%) (14.96%) Digital / WEB 19 677 20 104 22 198 22 164 (2.13%) (5.85%) Revenues from ho.re.ca division 54 778 56 860 25 938 17 567 (3.66%) 45.32% Other Revenues 247 1 436 910 910 (82.79%) (47.90%) In the countries in which it operates through the Wholesale channel  IWB has managed to obtain revenue growth rates higher than those expressed by the reference market  positively combining (x) organic growth  (y) development of own-brand and higher margins products and (z) M&A. These results were obtained mainly thanks to: to a continuous renewal  expansion  and enrichment of the own-brand product portfolio  in particular in the ""premium"" range which make the commercial offer of the IWB Group essential for more relevant customers as it is synonymous with quality in a unique packaging. a consolidated presence in countries with the highest ""resilient"" per capita consumption of wine; the capacity to enter new countries/markets both as a reference partner for the customers and as an ability to acquire newcustomers. a widespread international commercial team which represents an element of uniqueness in the sector and which has made it possible to: (x) develop the Eastern European market with revenues growing by 25% compared to 2022 (y) achieve a further important growth in the UK thanks to Prosecco and in France both thanks to the increase in the product portfolio sold to the two main customers and to the overall success of prosecco compared to champagne. Distance selling revenues  after the strong growth recorded in the period 2020-2021  is going back over the 2019 levels. However  it is worth mentioning the stability of online sales  despite the retracement of the market. Ho.re.ca revenues  which constitute an essential completion of the channel portfolio within the Group  have more than doubled  going from Euro 25.9 in 2021 to Euro 54.8 million in 2023 (+ Euro 28.8 million). These results were achieved in particular thanks to M&A activity  which accelerated the entry process and allowed the Group to (i) position itself on relevant customers already at the end of the pandemic period in the phase in which consumption opportunities moved outside the domestic environment and (ii) to be in an extremely favorable position to acquire new customers at the same time. Margins In 2023 the Italian Wine Brands group achieved a consolidated adjusted Ebitda of Euro 44.3 million compared with a pro-forma consolidated Adjusted Ebitda of 2022 of Euro 37.2 million.

This compensated commercial investments in advertising and commissions who helped stable revenues.an increase in personnel costs from Euro 24.3 million in 2022 to Euro 25.1 million in 2023 attributable to the greater percentage of wine production and bottling carried out internally which made it possible to significantly reduce the costs for external processing and increase the overall operating margin.

Individual situation of the parent company IWB S.p.A. The parent company IWB S.p.A. highlights a positive net result of Euro 7.2 million and a net financial debt of Euro 90.1 million.Moreover the IWB Board of Directors decided to propose to the Shareholders' Meeting a unitary dividend for the 2023 financial statements equal to Euro 0 5 for each share entitled to it. In case of approval  the following dates have been set for its distribution: May 6  2024 ex-dividend date; May 7  2024 record date; May 8  2024 payment date. The annual financial report and the consolidated financial report as at 31 December 2023 will be made available to the public in accordance with the terms and conditions established in the EGM Regulation  as well as on the IWB website www.italianwinebrands.it  in the Investor Relations - Financial Documents section. Significant events that occurred after the end of the financial year and Outlook There are no significant events following the end of the financial year other than the effectiveness of the merger between Provinco Italia S.p.A.  Enoitalia S.p.A  Barbanera S.r.l. and Fossalto S.r.l. which took place on 1 January 2024. The IWB Group is proud and very satisfied about 2023 results: (i) stable turnover despite the market (ii) Ebitda margin above 10% (iii) significant cash generation. IWB is aware of the uncertainty of the general macroeconomic situation worsened by the conflicts in Ukraine and in the Middle East; nevertheless it continues to be confident in the potential growth of its business in the medium / long term thanks to the strong competitive positioning  to the solid financial structure  to the management's constant commitment to controlling costs and improving the efficiency of the production and the organization. In this sector the absolute greatest cost is the one of the bulk wines. In 2023  production stood at 50.4 million quintals of wine grapes compared to 67.2 in 2022  25.1% less looking at the national average  but with several Regions seeing harvest losses of well over 30%  reaching in some cases losses of 2/3 on last year's production (Source: Official balance sheet of the 2023 harvest campaign - Ministry of Agricultural Policies). In normal condition the harvest outcome will lead to potential bulk wine cost increase but the stock level at the Italian wineries  as a result of the abundant previous harvest and the drop in sales in terms of volume  is able to counterbalance it. In this context  the IWB Group positively face 2024 with: the main contracts renegotiated with the main customers; commercial initiatives in new countries aimed at expanding the customer portfolio; presence in all commercial channels  therefore with the possibility of following customer movements from one channel to another  without losing turnover; a solid and consolidated production structure; corporate integration  effective from 1 January 2024 which will allow further industrial and financial synergies to be obtained; a good level of raw material stock  which allows the year's purchases to be better negotiated; significantly reduced debt characterized by a fixed interest rate of 2.5%. and consequently in the best position obtain further improved results compared to 2023. Our job is to bring consistent results  to manage the company efficiently  to be state of the art  to understand where consumer demand is going and consequently offer them products in line with their desires. This is the way we have perfomed and we will improve our results. The market context could also favor a further growth through M&A consistently with the strategy of the Group on international markets  strengthening of brands and premium products.Other Corporate governance resolutions Bylaw update and Significance Criteria IWB also informs that today the Board of Directors  meeting in notarial form  approved the update of the art. 16.2 of the IWB bylaws wiping away the competence of the Euronext Growth Advisor for to the identification and evaluation of independent directors in order to align it to the provisions of the EGM Regulation  as amended with a notice from the Italian Stock Exchange n. 43747 of 17 November 2023.

The full report is attached to this release and will be available on Volta’s website shortly (www.voltafinance.com).PERFORMANCE and PORTFOLIO ACTIVITYVolta Finance is pleased to report another positive performance in February at +1.0%  reflecting the price appreciation of the fund’s underlying portfolios through the month. For comparison  US High Yield returned +0.31% and European High Yield returned +0.35% over the same period.The strong sentiment from January fed through February as major Credit indices like iTrax Xover hit 2yrs tights at +300bps. European loans were slightly down from 97.00px to 96.80px  although still significantly up year-to-date (96.00px as of Dec 2023). On the US side  loans recorded a 20 cents gain and reached 96.45px  their highest level since mid-2022. The momentum was evidently supported by a strong Q4 2023 US earnings season – proving once more the resilience of the US economic activity. Bonds yields continued to trend higher amid ongoing evidence of sticky core inflation and central banks’ hinting at potentially delaying rate cuts.In terms of CLO issuance  the US and European primary markets have fully reopened. Issuance volumes have surged by +48% in the U.S.  reaching $33.66 billion  and by +12% in Europe  totalling €5.84 billion compared to year-to-date figures for 2023. This impacted secondary as volumes of activity reduced in favor of the primary market and as spreads moved inside of primary (50bps for instance on CLO BB tranches).Strategy in February was to take advantage of the strong momentum in both the Primary CLO market and Loans. We converted one of our US CLO warehouse investment into a New Issue US CLO transaction  from which we purchased an CLO Equity position ($7.93m invested) in the early days of February. Also  we continued to rotate from vintaged CLO debt tranches that had passed their reinvestment period into New Issue transactions as we purchased $6m of fresh US BBs and sold c.$5m of US CLO BB. Last but not least  we were able to participate in another US CLO Equity (c. $4.3m consideration) with upside scenarios in the 16-18% IRR range.From the perspective of cashflow generation  over the last 6-month period Volta received 21.6% annualized cash flow compared to NAV (€27.5m of interests and coupons)  a level that is largely stable since early 2023. We expect distributions to be broadly stable at the April distribution date.In terms of relative value  we currently see more value in equity over BB/B. We appreciate the high cash-on-cash nature of CLO equity and its shorter duration profile. Our preferred route for CLO equity is in the primary market  where we can select the right manager and source sizes to target mid-teens returns. We also opportunistically explore the secondary market to optimize our fund.Volta’s underlying sub asset classes monthly performances** were as follow: +1.2% for Bank Balance Sheet transactions  +1.7% for CLO Equity tranches  +1.6% for CLO Debt tranches and -14.3% for Cash Corporate Credit and ABS.As of end of February 2024  Volta’s NAV was €254.7m  i.e. €6.96 per share.*It should be noted that approximately 5.47% of Volta’s GAV comprises investments for which the relevant NAVs as at the month-end date are normally available only after Volta’s NAV has already been published. Volta’s policy is to publish its NAV on as timely a basis as possible to provide shareholders with Volta’s appropriately up-to-date NAV information. Consequently  such investments are valued using the most recently available NAV for each fund or quoted price for such subordinated notes. The most recently available fund NAV or quoted price was 5.22% as at 31 January 2024 and 0.25% as at 30 September 2023.** “performances” of asset classes are calculated as the Dietz-performance of the assets in each bucket  taking into account the Mark-to-Market of the assets at period ends  payments received from the assets over the period  and ignoring changes in cross-currency rates. Nevertheless  some residual currency effects could impact the aggregate value of the portfolio when aggregating each bucket.CONTACTSFor the Investment ManagerAXA Investment Managers ParisFrançois Touatifrancois.touati@axa-im.com+33 (0) 1 44 45 80 22Olivier PonsOlivier.pons@axa-im.com+33 (0) 1 44 45 87 30Company Secretary and AdministratorBNP Paribas S.A  Guernsey Branchguernsey.bp2s.volta.cosec@bnpparibas.com+44 (0) 1481 750 853Corporate BrokerCenkos Securities plcAndrew WorneDaniel Balabanoff+44 (0) 20 7397 8900*****ABOUT VOLTA FINANCE LIMITEDVolta Finance Limited is incorporated in Guernsey under The Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008 (as amended) and listed on Euronext Amsterdam and the London Stock Exchange's Main Market for listed securities.

Annual revenue growth (up €1.9m or 11%) was driven by the increase in sales of the team on mission and team on the run business solutions (up €1.9m or +16%)  which now account for 73% (+3 percentage points) of the Group's full-year revenue. This growth was mainly fuelled by the continued deployment of the PCSTORM project (multi-year maintenance contract  large-scale operational deployment during the 2023 Rugby World Cup  and development and delivery of team on mission 4.0)  as well as new private-sector contracts (transport and energy) and projects for local authorities. The partnership with Airbus Public Safety and Security (formerly the Secure Land Communications division) continues to generate strong revenues following contract renegotiations at the end of 2023 covering the next three years.This solid growth had a direct positive impact on EBITDA  which increased €1.7m (+18% to €11.4m)  representing 59% of full-year revenue (+4 percentage points).Operating expenses remained relatively stable at €8.1m  versus €7.9m in 2022. External expenses were kept under control (up €0.2m) and helped bolster business growth (increase in marketing and travel costs). Net payroll for the period was stable at €6.4m  reflecting the Group's ability to generate strong leverage by consistently aligning its workforce and resources with business requirements.Total payroll before capitalisation of R&D costs came to €11.7m in 2023  compared to €11.6m in 2022 (195 people at 2023 year-end versus 193 in 2022).EBIT: €5.6m (29% of revenue)Net income: €4.2m (21% of revenue)The €0.5m increase in depreciation and amortisation was due to an increase in amortised development costs (up €0.5m to €4.6m)  which were impacted by the cumulative effect of gross capitalised values over the last three years and the release rate of newly developed versions.After depreciation and amortisation (€5.8m  including €4.6m in amortised development costs)  EBIT amounted to €5.6m  up €1.2m  and represented 29% of 2023 full-year revenue versus 25% in 2022.After a €0.3m net financial expense (primarily due to currency losses for the period) and a €1.2m net tax charge mainly arising from the non-cash deferred tax impact of the capitalisation of development costs  net income came to €4.2m  up €0.8m versus 2022. This generated a net margin of 21%  up from 19% in 2022._ REINFORCED CASH POSITION AND FINANCIAL STRUCTUREThe balance sheet total was €48.4m  up from €38.9m at 31 December 2022 (see appendix below). The Group's financial structure was further strengthened at 31 December 2023 with shareholders' equity up €1.4m to €22.5m and a healthy net cash balance of €6.4m (excluding lease liabilities). Gross cash and cash equivalents amounted to €15.6m at 31 December 2023  up €4.3m (see appendix below) versus 31 December 2022.More precisely  operating cash flow amounted to €6.6m (including the impact of a €0.7m IFRS 16 reclassification between operating and financing cash flows) and decreased €2.7m over 2022  mainly due to a €4.2m increase in working capital (resulting from business growth and significant billings at the end of the period). Gross operating cash flow increased €1.5m to €10.3m. Cash flow from investing activities (€5.8m  down €1.3m) mainly includes recurring product development costs (€6.4m partly financed by €1.1m in research tax credit refunds in 2023). Lastly  cash flows from financing activities were positive at €3.5m  following (i) changes in borrowings (up €6.4m)  taking into account new loans taken out in March 2023 totalling €7.5m and repayments of €1.1m during the period  (ii) the change in lease liabilities over time (€0.5m increase) and (iii) net buybacks of treasury shares (€2.4m outflow)._ 2024 OUTLOOK: PROVEN TECHNOLOGY AND DIVERSIFICATION OF REVENUE SOURCESAs announced in February's 2023 revenue release  2023 performance was driven by a solid second half  with earnings and operating margins therefore up versus the previous year.While current 2024 full-year revenue projections are satisfactory  the level of growth versus 2023 is not yet entirely certain. However  a number of projects were finalised at the end of 2023  both in the public sphere with the team on mission solution and the private sector with the team on the run solution  as well as in the “legacy” sector. The Group is still aiming to maintain profitable growth momentum and secure the means to achieve this. The financing obtained in March 2023 will enable the Group to continue developing its solutions and further extend its technological lead.The Group's investments in staff and technologies since the end of 2023 will therefore continue over the coming months  in an effort to strengthen sovereignty  security  compliance with industry standards (particularly 3GPP) and scalability of the solutions developed  in a context where artificial intelligence (LLMs  etc.) will have an impact on workstation ergonomics. Keeping these costs under control and securing financing will remain a priority in 2024.Meanwhile  the Group continues to develop its indirect business ecosystem  seeking to further diversify its revenue sources and reduce its dependence on the public safety and MCx sector alone  which is marked by long sales and deployment cycles.The solutions developed include a broad range of features (instant messaging  voice  video  PTT  alerts  LWP  localisation  advanced telephony  collaborative suite  process digitisation  FSM  geofencing  APIs  SDKs  etc.)  and effectively meet the technical and organisational requirements of companies and public authorities by offering an all-in-one solution within a secure  scalable and sovereign technical architecture. In early 2024  the Group obtained ISO 27001 certification for all of its businesses  further enhancing the credibility and competitive positioning of the platforms it offers.These days  business environments across all sectors require unified communications  a fast and secure connection with all stakeholders and effective coordination in order to optimise operations and other business processes. The Group's technological solutions help teams stay connected and ensure cohesive action. Protecting data and teams is also a key issue for organisations. Responding to this issue with a simple  reliable and sovereign tool is an increasingly prevalent requirement that will continue to grow.While the rate at which new communications and business-critical technologies are being deployed and adopted remains a limiting and external variable  the Group's sales momentum is set to continue over the coming months.

The trial is double-blind for the placebo arm and lanifibranor (800mg daily) arm  and open-label for the combination of lanifibranor (800mg daily) and empagliflozin (10 mg daily) arm. The diagnosis of non-cirrhotic MASH/NASH was based on historic histology evaluation or a combination of non-invasive methods including diagnostic methods including imaging. As planned per protocol  the interim analysis was done once half of the 63 planned randomized patients with MASH completed the 24-week treatment period or prematurely discontinued from treatment.The study achieved the primary efficacy endpoint with an absolute reduction in Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of 1.14% and 1.59% in patients with MASH and T2D treated with lanifibranor (800mg daily) or in combination with empagliflozin (10mg daily) at week 24 compared to an increase of 0.26% observed in the placebo arm.The study also demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in hepatic steatosis measured by MRI-PDFF1  in patients treated with lanifibranor alone and in combination with empagliflozin  -47% and -38% respectively  compared to placebo (0%). 83% and 67% of patients treated with lanifibranor alone or in combination with empagliflozin respectively  showed a reduction greater or equal to 30% of their hepatic fat  compared to 0% in the placebo arm. In addition  the study demonstrated a statistically significant effect on several secondary and exploratory endpoints  including liver enzymes (alanine aminotransferase (“ALT”) and aspartate aminotransferase (“AST”))  insulin resistance (HOMA-IR)  HDL  and adiponectin (see tables below). Markers of liver inflammation and fibrosis (corrected T1 relaxation time (cT1) assessed by LiverMultiScan®) were assessed for the first time with lanifibranor and showed a significant effect with lanifibranor alone and in combination with empagliflozin.The study also demonstrated that patients treated with lanifibranor in combination with empagliflozin maintained a stable weight throughout the 24 weeks study  addressing the moderate  metabolically healthy  weight gain that can be observed in some patients treated with lanifibranor alone. Furthermore  these results demonstrated a significant relative reduction in the VAT/SAT ratio (visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue) in patients treated with lanifibranor alone or in combination with empagliflozin  -5% and -17% respectively  compared to an increase of 11% in patients under placebo. This result reflects a shift from pro-inflammatory visceral fat towards metabolically healthy adipose tissue.The treatment with lanifibranor 800mg/daily alone and in combination with empagliflozin 10mg/daily for 24 weeks appears to be well tolerated  with no safety concerns reported.Dr. Michael Cooreman  M.D.  Chief Medical Officer of Inventiva: “The results of the LEGEND study announced today further illustrate the potential of lanifibranor to address the broad spectrum of the disease biology of MASH and T2D. These data complement the already published dataset of lanifibranor demonstrating fibrosis improvement and MASH resolution but also its role as a potent insulin sensitizer. With roughly 50% of the U.S. population estimated to have either prediabetes or diabetes  and the well-established correlation between MASH and T2D  lanifibranor has a unique mechanism of action to potentially address the medical need of patients with both MASH and T2D. We wish to thank the patients who participated in the study and the investigators of LEGEND.”Dr. Onno Holleboom  MD PhD  endocrinologist and associate professor at Amsterdam UMC  co-principal investigator of the LEGEND Phase II clinical trial: “It is a big step seeing these positive results of LEGEND demonstrating the impact of lanifibranor on steatosis  inflammation and fibrosis while stabilizing weight with empagliflozin in patients with poorly controlled T2D and MASH. The study was designed as a proof of concept and these results are significant and strengthen confidence in the potential of lanifibranor to address the specific metabolic unbalance in patients with T2D while also addressing steatosis and fibrosis  a hepatic consequence of insulin resistance.”Prof. Michelle Lai  M.D.  Ph.D.  Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and co-principal investigator of the LEGEND Phase II clinical trial  said: “These LEGEND results provide valuable insights on the complementary mechanisms of action of an SGLT2 inhibitor and the panPPAR agonist  lanifibranor. MASH is a multifaceted disease that we believe will benefit from combination therapies in order to properly address the full cardiometabolic spectrum of the disease. These results of LEGEND suggest that lanifibranor in combination with empagliflozin could be an ideal combination for patients we care for in our clinic who suffer from T2D and MASH.”Given that the primary endpoint of LEGEND was met  and statistically significant results were achieved on several key additional markers  the Company has decided to stop the recruitment as defined per protocol. More details on these results are expected to be presented in upcoming scientific conferences and submitted for publication.Summary HbA1C improvement at Week 24 Full Analysis Seta (N=30) Placebo(n=9) Lani 800mg (n=11) Lani 800mg +Empa 10mg (n=10) HbA1c (%)  LS Mean Absolute Change from Baseline to Week 24 0.26 -1.14* -1.59** Completersb (N=24) Placebo(n=5) Lani 800mg (n=11) Lani 800mg +Empa 10mg (n=8) Responders with HbA1C level < 6.5% at Week 24 (%) 0 55 63 Responders with HbA1c absolute decrease ≥1% from baseline  at Week 24 (%) 0 64 88 a Two patients were not considered in the Full Analysis Set because we do not have post-treatment HbA1c values available*p<0.01  **p<0.001  versus placebo (Mixed Model Repeated Measure [MMRM])b Eight patients were not considered in the Completers set because of premature discontinuation before Week 24 or missing data due to prior intercurrent events (Rescue medication or significant diet modification affecting the primary endpoint).LS=Least Square.Summary of improvement in non-invasive measures of hepatic steatosis inflammation and fibrosis markers  and liver injury  at Week 24 Full Analysis Set Mean Change from Baseline to Week 24 Placebo Lani 800mg Lani 800mg +Empa 10mg MRI-PDFF (%)a 0 (n=5) -47* (n=12) -38* (n=9) cT1 (ms)b 15 (n=4) -82 (n=12) -85 (n=9) ALT (%)a 2.5 (n=9) -36.4** (n=12) -51.3*** (n=10) AST (%)a 17.1 (n=9) -24.7** (n=12) -34.6*** (n=10) a LS Mean relative change from baseline to week 24  from an Analysis of Covariance model (ANCOVA) or Mixed Model Repeated Measure (MMRM)b LS Mean absolute change from baseline to week 24  from an ANCOVA.*p≤0.05  **p<0.01  ***p<0.001  versus placebo (ANCOVA or MMRM)ALT: Alanine Aminotransferase  AST: Aspartate Aminotransferase  cT1: Corrected T1  LS=Least Square  MRI-PDFF: Magnetic resonance imaging-derived proton density fat fraction.Summary of improvement in Cardiometabolic Markers and Weight  at Week 24 Full Analysis Set Mean Change from Baseline to Week 24 Placebo Lani 800mg Lani 800mg +Empa 10mg HDL-C (mmol/L)a -0.01 (n=9) 0.17 (n=12) 0.22* (n=10) Insulin (pmol/L)a -58.3 (n=9) -93.9 (n=11) -155.1* (n=10) HOMA-IR (%)b -7 (n=9) -51* (n=11) -69** (n=10) Adiponectinc 1.1 (n=9) 2.8* (n=11) 3.0* (n=10) Body weightd (%) -0.8 (n=5) 3.6 (n=12) -0.4 (n=8) VAT/SAT (%)b 11 (n=4) -5 (n=8) -17** (n=7) a LS Mean absolute change from baseline to week 24b LS Mean relative change from baseline to week 24c LS Mean fold change from baseline to week 24d Relative change from baseline to week 24*p<0.05  **p<0.01  ***p<0.001  versus placebo (Mixed Model Repeated Measure [MMRM] or Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA)).HDL-C: High density lipoprotein cholesterol  HOMA: Homeostasic model assessment  LS=Least Square  SAT=Subcutaneous Adipose Tissue  VAT=Visceral Adipose Tissue.Conference callInventiva will host a conference call and webcast with slide presentation on Tuesday  March 19  2024 at 8:00 am ET (New York time) 1:00 pm CET (Paris time).Introduced by Frederic Cren  Chairman  CEO and cofounder of Inventiva  this event will be as follow:Presentation of LEGEND Results - Michael Cooreman  M.D.  CMO of InventivaMichael Cooreman  M.D.  CMO of Inventiva Metabolic and hepatic benefits of lanifibranor - Stephen Harrison  M.D.  Pinnacle Clinical Research and principal investigator of the exploratory cohort of NATiV3  Phase III clinical trialStephen Harrison  M.D.  Pinnacle Clinical Research and principal investigator of the exploratory cohort of NATiV3  Phase III clinical trial Vascular benefits of lanifibranor - Sven Francque  M.D.  University Hospital Antwerp  co-principal investigator of NATiV3  Phase III clinical trial- Sven Francque  M.D.  University Hospital Antwerp  co-principal investigator of NATiV3  Phase III clinical trial Opportunity for lanifibranor - Frederic Cren  CEO and cofounder of InventivaThe conference call and the slides of the presentation will be webcast live at: https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/hyuvxf9a and will also be available on Inventiva’s website: Investor Presentations - Inventiva Pharma .

Lanifibranor is a PPAR agonist that is designed to target all three PPAR isoforms in a moderately potent manner  with a ‑wellbalanced‑ activation of PPARα and PPARδ  and a partial activation of PPARγ. While there are other PPAR agonists that target only one or two PPAR isoforms for activation  lanifibranor is the only panPPAR‑ agonist in clinical development for the treatment of MASH/NASH. Inventiva believes that lanifibranor’s moderate and balanced panPPAR‑ binding profile contributes to the favorable tolerability profile that has been observed in clinical trials and preclinical studies to date. The FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy and Fast Track designation to lanifibranor‑ for the treatment of MASH/NASH.About InventivaInventiva is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the research and development of oral small molecule therapies for the treatment of patients with MASH/NASH  and other diseases with significant unmet medical need. The Company benefits from a strong expertise and experience in the domain of compounds targeting nuclear receptors  transcription factors and epigenetic modulation. Inventiva is currently advancing one clinical candidate  has a pipeline of two preclinical programs and continues to explore other development opportunities to add to its pipeline.Inventiva’s lead product candidate  lanifibranor  is currently in a pivotal Phase III clinical trial  NATiV3  for the treatment of adult patients with MASH/NASH  a common and progressive chronic liver disease for which there are currently no approved therapies.Inventiva’s pipeline also includes odiparcil  a drug candidate for the treatment of adult MPS VI patients. As part of Inventiva’s decision to focus clinical efforts on the development of lanifibranor  it suspended its clinical efforts relating to odiparcil and is reviewing available options with respect to its potential further development. Inventiva is also in the process of selecting a candidate for its Hippo signaling pathway program.The Company has a scientific team of approximately 90 people with deep expertise in the fields of biology  medicinal and computational chemistry  pharmacokinetics and pharmacology  and clinical development. It owns an extensive library of approximately 240 000 pharmacologically relevant molecules  approximately 60% of which are proprietary  as well as a wholly-owned research and development facility.Inventiva is a public company listed on compartment B of the regulated market of Euronext Paris (ticker: IVA  ISIN: FR0013233012) and on the Nasdaq Global Market in the United States (ticker: IVA). www.inventivapharma.comContactsInventivaPascaline ClercEVP  Strategy and Corporate Affairsmedia@inventivapharma.com+1 202 499 8937 Brunswick GroupTristan Roquet Montegon /Aude Lepreux /Julia CailleteauMedia relationsinventiva@brunswickgroup.com+33 1 53 96 83 83 Westwicke  an ICR CompanyPatricia L.

Rationale for the Offers The purpose of the Offers in respect of the Securities is  amongst other things  to proactively manage the Offeror's balance sheet. Simultaneously  the Offers will enable the Offeror to manage its overall wholesale funding level and better optimise its future interest expense. The Offers in respect of the Hybrid Securities do not constitute a Deferred Interest Payment Event (as defined in the terms and conditions of such Securities). 2The acceptance of Securities for purchase pursuant to the Offers and the settlement of the Offers is conditional upon certain conditions  all as further described below in ""Transaction Conditions"". Securities repurchased by the Offeror pursuant to the Offers will be cancelled. Securities which have not been validly tendered and/or accepted for purchase by the Offeror pursuant to the Offers will remain outstanding after the Settlement Date. Transaction Conditions The Offeror's acceptance of Securities for purchase validly tendered in accordance with the terms of the Offers will be irrevocable and will be subject to satisfaction of the Transaction Conditions described below. Once accepted (subject only as aforesaid)  the Offers will constitute binding obligations of the submitting Holders of the Securities and the Offeror to settle the Offers. The acceptance by the Offeror of Securities for purchase will be subject to there not having been threatened  instituted or pending any action or proceeding before any court or governmental  regulatory or administrative body that: (1) makes or seeks to make illegal the payment for  or acceptance of payment for  any of the Securities pursuant to the terms and conditions contained in the Tender Offer Memorandum; (2) would or might result in a delay in  or restrict  the ability of the Offeror to purchase any of the Securities; or (3) imposes or seeks to impose limitations on the ability of the Offeror to purchase the Securities (together  the ""Transaction Conditions""). Details of the Offers Purchase Price The price the Offeror will pay for Securities of each Series validly tendered and accepted for purchase by the Offeror pursuant to the relevant Offer will be determined pursuant to an unmodified Dutch auction procedure  as more fully described in the Tender Offer Memorandum (the ""Unmodified Dutch Auction Procedure""). Under the Unmodified Dutch Auction Procedure  the purchase price (specific to each Holder of Securities) in respect of each Series of Securities validly tendered by a Holder and which will be purchased by the Offeror pursuant to the relevant Offer (each such price  expressed as a percentage of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities of the relevant Series which will be purchased by the Offeror from such Holder  a ""Purchase Price"") shall be equal to the particular purchase price specified by the relevant Holder of Securities in the relevant Tender Instruction  subject to the Minimum Purchase Price (as more fully described in the Tender Offer Memorandum). As the Purchase Price applicable to each relevant Holder of Securities is the price in respect of the relevant Securities specified by such Holder in its Tender Instruction  the Purchase Price payable to each Holder of Securities of the same Series will not necessarily be the same. Maximum Acceptance Amount  Maximum Securities Purchase Consideration and Series Acceptance Amount The Offeror proposes to accept  on the terms and subject to the conditions described in the Tender Offer Memorandum  an aggregate principal amount of Securities such that the Securities Purchase Consideration does not exceed the Maximum Securities Purchase Consideration (the ""Maximum Acceptance Amount""). ""Securities Purchase Consideration"" means the total purchase consideration for the Securities validly tendered and accepted for purchase pursuant to the Offers (excluding Accrued Interest Payments in respect of such Securities) and ""Maximum Securities Purchase Consideration"" means EUR 250 000 000. The Offeror will determine the aggregate principal amount of Securities of the relevant Series which it elects to purchase pursuant to the relevant Offer (each a ""Series Acceptance Amount"") in its sole and absolute discretion. The Offeror reserves the right  in its sole and absolute discretion  to purchase Securities in an aggregate principal amount which is either more or less than the Maximum Acceptance Amount. 3Accrued Interest Payment The Offeror will also pay  on the Settlement Date (subject to satisfaction or (if applicable) waiver of the Transaction Conditions on or prior to the Settlement Date)  an Accrued Interest Payment in respect of Securities (other than the Hybrid Securities) accepted for purchase pursuant to the Offers. In respect of any Hybrid Securities accepted for purchase pursuant to the Offers  the Offeror will not make any Accrued Interest Payment in respect of such Securities or any payment of any Deferred Interest (as defined in the terms and conditions of such Securities). Tender Instructions In order to participate in  and be eligible to receive the relevant Purchase Price and Accrued Interest Payment pursuant to  the Offers  Holders must validly tender their Securities by delivering  or arranging to have delivered on their behalf  a valid Tender Instruction that is received by the Tender Agent by 4.00 p.m. (London time) on 22 March 2024 (the ""Expiration Deadline""). Tender Instructions will be irrevocable except in the limited circumstances described in the Tender Offer Memorandum. Tender Instructions may be submitted on a ""non-competitive"" or a ""competitive"" basis as follows: Non-Competitive Tender Instructions In respect of any Series  Holders of Securities may submit one or more Non-Competitive Tender Instructions in respect of the Securities prior to the Expiration Deadline. Non-Competitive Tender Instructions need not specify an Offer Price  but must specify the aggregate principal amount of Securities of the relevant Series that the relevant Holder of Securities is offering pursuant to such Non-Competitive Tender Instruction. The aggregate principal amount of Securities of the relevant Series specified in the relevant Non-Competitive Tender Instructions should be an Integral Multiple in respect of the relevant Series  subject to such specified amount being no less than the relevant Minimum Denomination in respect of the relevant Series. ""Minimum Denomination"" means (i) in respect of each Series of the Securities (other than the March 2025 Securities): EUR 100 000 and (ii) in respect of the March 2025 Securities: EUR 200 000. ""Integral Multiples"" means (i) in respect of each Series of the Securities (other than the March 2025 Securities and the 2040 Securities): EUR 1 000 and (ii) in respect of the March 2025 Securities and the 2040 Securities: EUR 100 000. In respect of any Series  the Offeror will accept for purchase all validly tendered Securities pursuant to Non-Competitive Tender Instructions if it accepts for purchase any validly tendered Securities pursuant to Competitive Tender Instructions. If the Offeror accepts a Non-Competitive Tender Instruction  the relevant Holder of Securities will receive the Minimum Purchase Price for the Securities of the relevant Series. In the event that the Non-Competitive Tender Instructions submitted result in more Securities of the relevant Series being offered than the applicable Series Acceptance Amount  such Non-Competitive Tender Instructions will be accepted on a pro rata basis (as described below under ""Scaling"") such that the aggregate principal amount of Securities of such Series accepted for purchase is no greater than such Series Acceptance Amount. In such circumstances  the relevant Maximum Purchase Price will be the Minimum Purchase Price for such Series  and the Offeror will not accept for purchase any Securities of such Series tendered pursuant to Competitive Tender Instructions (as described in the Tender Offer Memorandum). Tender Instructions that do not specify an Offer Price  or that specify an Offer Price equal to  or below  the Minimum Purchase Price will be treated as Non-Competitive Tender Instructions. The applicable Purchase Price for Non-Competitive Tender Instructions shall in no circumstances be less than the Minimum Purchase Price. 4Competitive Tender Instructions Alternatively  in respect of any Series  a Holder of Securities may submit one or more Competitive Tender Instructions in respect of the Securities prior to the Expiration Deadline  provided that the aggregate principal amount outstanding of the Securities of the relevant Series that are the subject of these Competitive Tender Instructions does not exceed the aggregate principal amount of Securities of the relevant Series that each such Holder of Securities holds. Competitive Tender Instructions must specify: the Offer Price (expressed as a percentage  and which must be expressed in an increment of 0.10 per cent. above the Minimum Purchase Price) that such Holder of Securities would be willing to accept as the Purchase Price in respect of the Securities of the relevant Series that are the subject of the particular Tender Instruction. In the event that any Tender Instruction in respect of Securities specifies an Offer Price that is not the Minimum Purchase Price or an integral increment of 0.10 per cent. above the Minimum Purchase Price  the Offer Price so specified shall be rounded up to the nearest such increment of 0.10 per cent. above the relevant Minimum Purchase Price  and the Tender Instruction shall be deemed to have specified such figure as the Offer Price; andthe aggregate principal amount of Securities of the relevant Series that the relevant Holder of Securities is tendering at that Offer Price. The aggregate principal amount of Securities of the relevant Series specified in the relevant Competitive Tender Instructions should be an Integral Multiple in respect of the relevant Series  subject to such specified amount being no less than the relevant Minimum Denomination in respect of the relevant Series. In respect of any Series  the Offeror will not accept for purchase any validly tendered Securities pursuant to Competitive Tender Instructions unless it has also accepted for purchase all validly tendered Securities pursuant to Non-Competitive Tender Instructions. If the Offeror accepts a Competitive Tender Instruction (or Competitive Tender Instructions) the relevant Holder of Securities will receive the Offer Price offered by such Holder for the Securities of the relevant Series. If (other than as described under ""Non-CompetitiveTender Instructions"" above) the aggregate principal amount of Securities of a Series validly tendered (i) pursuant to Non-Competitive Tender Instructions and pursuant to Competitive Tender Instructions that specify a purchase price that is less than or equal to the relevant Maximum Purchase Price (as defined below)  is greater than the relevant Series Acceptance Amount  the Offeror intends to accept for purchase (A) first  all such Securities tendered at purchase prices below such Maximum Purchase Price (including Securities of such Series tendered pursuant to Non- Competitive Tender Instructions) in full  and (B) second  all such Securities tendered at such Maximum Purchase Price on a pro rata basis  such that the aggregate principal amount of Securities of such Series accepted for purchase is no greater than such Series Acceptance Amount. ""Maximum Purchase Price"" means  in respect of any Series of Securities  the highest price at which any Securities of such Series will be accepted for purchase by the Offeror. Scaling In the circumstances described in the Tender Offer Memorandum in which Securities of a Series validly tendered pursuant to an Offer are to be accepted on a pro rata basis  each such tender will be scaled by a factor (a ""Scaling Factor"") equal to (i) the relevant Series Acceptance Amount less the aggregate principal amount outstanding of the Securities of such Series that have been validly tendered and accepted for purchase and are not subject to acceptance on a pro rata basis  if applicable  divided by (ii) the aggregate principal amount outstanding of the Securities of such Series that have been validly tendered and are subject to acceptance on a pro rata basis (subject to adjustment to allow for the aggregate principal amount of Securities of such Series accepted for purchase  following the rounding of Tender Instructions as set out below  to equal the relevant Series Acceptance Amount exactly). Each tender of Securities that is scaled in this manner will be rounded down to the nearest Integral Multiple in principal amount for the Securities of the relevant Series in the manner set out in the Tender Offer Memorandum.
