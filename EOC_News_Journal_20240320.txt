The Programme is aimed at the CEO  members of the Group Management  General Managers and certain other key employees in the Boliden Group and shall be implemented after Boliden's Annual General Meeting in 2024.The overall purpose of the Programme is to maintain a close community of interest between employees and shareholders by incentivizing employees to increase the value of the company. The Programme is intended to attract and retain key employees. The Programme should be achievable  easy to understand  cost-effective to administer and easy to communicate.a) Implementation of the ProgrammeThe Board of Directors proposes to implement the Programme on the main terms set out below.The Programme is proposed to be directed to 40 permanent employees within the Boliden Group  which are divided into the following four categories: the CEO of Boliden (""Group 1"")  members of the Group Management (currently four persons) (""Group 2"")  General Managers (currently eleven persons) (""Group 3"") and 24 other pre-identified key persons in the Boliden Group (""Group 4""). The participants in Groups 1-4 are together referred to as the ""Participants"". In order to participate in the Programme  the employees are required to personally invest in shares in Boliden  and that these shares are allocated to the Programme  or that shares already held in Boliden are allocated to the Programme[1]  no later than 30 September 2024   unless the Board of Directors decides to postpone the date (""Investment Shares""). The Investment Shares shall be retained throughout the Vesting Period (as defined below). For each Investment Share  the Participants have the possibility to  free of charge  either by Boliden  by another company in the Boliden Group or by a designated third party  be allotted a maximum of three (3) shares in Boliden conditional upon continued employment and uninterrupted holding of Investment Shares and fulfilment of certain performance conditions (as further described in section (d) below) (""Performance Shares""). The Performance Shares will be granted after the expiry of a vesting period  which runs from and including 1 June 2024 up to and including 31 May 2027 (the ""Vesting Period""). The allotment of Performance Shares shall be dependent on the extent to which the performance conditions for the Programme have been fulfilled. The performance conditions shall consist of a financial target specific to the Programme related to the total shareholder return (""TSR"") for Boliden's share (the ""TSR Condition"") and a sustainability target (the ""Sustainability Condition"")  as further described below. The TSR Condition will be weighted with 80 per cent and the Sustainability Condition with 20 per cent when determining the allotment of Performance Shares. After the end of the Vesting Period  the Board of Directors will publish the extent to which the TSR Condition and the Sustainability Condition have been fulfilled.The TSR Condition shall be related to the TSR of Boliden's share during a period of 20 trading days after Boliden's publication of the year-end report for the financial year 2023 compared to 20 trading days after Boliden's publication of the year-end report for the financial year 2026 (the ""Measurement Period"") in relation to the TSR of a peer group of other companies.[2]A condition for allotment of Performance Shares under the TSR Condition is that the TSR for Boliden's share exceeds the weighted TSR outcome for the peer group during the Measurement Period (the ""TSR Minimum Level""). If the TSR Minimum Level is not achieved  no allotment of Performance Shares related to the TSR Condition will be made. For maximum allotment (100 per cent)  the TSR for Boliden's share must exceed the weighted TSR outcome for the peer group by at least 12.5 percentage points during the Measurement Period (the ""TSR Maximum Level""). If the TSR for Boliden's share amounts to between the TSR Minimum Level and the TSR Maximum Level during the Measurement Period  a linear allocation is made.The Sustainability Condition shall be related to the reduction of Boliden's carbon dioxide emissions in absolute terms. A condition for allotment of Performance Shares under the Sustainability Condition is that Boliden's carbon dioxide emissions in absolute terms (Scope 1 and Scope 2 according to the Green-house Gas Protocol) during the financial year 2026 have been reduced by at least 15 per cent compared to Boliden's carbon dioxide emissions in absolute terms during the financial year 2021.[3] Participants in Group 1-2 may invest in Investment Shares at a value corresponding to a maximum of 15 per cent of the Participant's annual gross fixed base salary for 2023  adjusted for the increase in the income base amount in Sweden for 2024 compared to 2023. Participants in Group 3-4 may invest in Investment Shares at a value corresponding to a maximum of 10 per cent of the Participant's annual gross fixed base salary for 2023  adjusted for the increase in the income base amount in Sweden for 2024 compared to 2023. The number of Investment Shares that Participants may acquire is determined on the basis of the volume-weighted average share price of the Boliden share during a period of 20 trading days after Boliden's publication of the year-end report for the financial year 2023. Performance Shares may normally only be allotted after the end of the Vesting Period. The total value of Performance Shares allotted to Participants may not exceed 150 per cent of the Participant's annual individual gross fixed base salary for 2027 (the ""Cap""). The value of the Performance Shares for calculation of the Cap is determined based on the volume weighted average share price of the Boliden share during a period of 20 trading days prior to the end of the Vesting Period. For a Participant to be allotted Performance Shares  it shall normally have been a permanent employee within the Boliden Group during the entire Vesting Period  and have retained the Investment Shares until the end of the Vesting Period. Investment Shares disposed of before the end of the Vesting Period shall not be included in the calculation for determining the allotment of Performance Shares. If there are significant changes in the Boliden Group or in the market which  in the opinion of the Board of Directors  would mean that the conditions for allotment of Performance Shares under the Programme are no longer reasonable  the Board of Directors shall be entitled to make adjustments to the Programme  including  inter alia  a right to resolve on a reduced allotment of Performance Shares  or that no allotment of Performance Shares shall take place at all. The Board of Directors shall be entitled to decide on the detailed terms and conditions of the Programme. In this respect  the Board of Directors shall be entitled to make necessary adjustments to these terms and conditions in order to fulfil specific rules or market conditions outside Sweden . Participation in the Programme is contingent upon such participation being legal in the relevant jurisdictions. Where  in the Board's opinion  Participants outside Sweden cannot be allotted Performance Shares at a reasonable cost or with reasonable administrative efforts  it shall be entitled to decide on a cash settlement for such Participants. The Programme shall comprise a maximum of 100 000 Performance Shares in Boliden. The number of Performance Shares shall be subject to recalculation to take into account any intervening bonus issues  splits  rights issues  dividend exceeding 15 per cent of the Group's equity for a given financial year and/or other similar corporate events.Costs of the Programme  etc.The costs for the Programme  which are recognized in the income statement  are calculated in accordance with the accounting standard IFRS 2 and are accrued over the Vesting Period. The calculation has been carried out based on the quoted closing price for shares in Boliden as of 29 December 2023  i.e. SEK 314.5 per share  and with the following assumptions: (i) an annual employee turnover of approximately 7 per cent  (ii) fulfilment of the TSR Condition of 100 per cent and fulfilment of the Sustainability Condition  (iii) all 40 Participants invest the maximum amount in the Programme  (iv) all remaining Participants are entitled to allotment of the maximum number of Performance Shares in the Programme  (v) a tax rate for social security contributions of 30 per cent under the Programme  and (vi) a total maximum of 100 000 Performance Shares available for allotment.Based on the above assumptions  the total costs for the Programme under IFRS 2 are estimated to amount to approximately SEK 17.1 million  excluding social security contributions. Assuming an annual share price increase of 15 per cent during the term of the Programme  the costs for social security contributions are estimated to amount to approximately SEK 11 million. Assuming instead an annual share price increase of 30 per cent during the duration of the Programme  the costs for social security contributions are estimated to amount to approximately SEK 15.9 million.Based on the above assumptions (and an annual share price increase of 15 per cent for calculation of the social security contributions)  the yearly costs are estimated to amount to approximately SEK 9.4 million  including social security contributions. This corresponds to approximately 0.2 per cent of the Boliden Group's total personnel costs for the financial year 2023.DilutionThe allotment of repurchased shares to fulfil the obligations under the Programme would result in the following dilution effects (under the assumptions stated below). At the maximum allotment of Performance Shares  the number of shares to be allotted free of charge in the Programme amounts to 100 000 shares in Boliden  which corresponds to approximately 0.04 per cent of the shares and votes (calculated based on the number of outstanding shares in Boliden as of 29 December 2023). The effects on key ratios and earnings per share are thus insignificant.Hedging arrangementsIn order to be able to implement the Programme in a cost-efficient and flexible manner  the Board of Directors has considered different methods for delivery of Performance Shares. The Board of Directors has thereby found the most cost-efficient alternative to be  and therefore proposes that the Annual General Meeting as the main alternative resolves on  repurchase and transfer of treasury shares. The Company currently holds 40 000 treasury shares. The detailed terms and conditions for the Board of Directors' main alternative are set out in section 21.b.i below.Should the required majority for item 21.b.i below not be reached  the Board of Directors proposes that Boliden shall be able to enter into equity swap agreements with third parties in accordance with item 21.b.ii below.Preparation of the proposalThe proposed Programme has  according to guidelines issued by Boliden's Board of Directors  been prepared by Boliden's Remuneration Committee  with the assistance of external advisors. The Remuneration Committee has presented the work to the Board of Directors  after which the Board of Directors has resolved to propose that the Programme is adopted at the Annual General Meeting 2024.-------------------b) Hedging arrangements in respect of the Programmei. Decisions on acquisitions and transfers of treasury sharesThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting (a) authorize the Board of Directors to resolve on acquisitions of treasury shares on Nasdaq Stockholm and (b) resolve that treasury shares may be transferred to the Participants in the Programme.a. The acquisition of treasury shares is subject to the following terms:Purchases of treasury shares may only be made on Nasdaq Stockholm. A maximum of 100 000 shares may be acquired to ensure delivery of shares to Participants. Acquisitions of shares in Boliden on Nasdaq Stockholm may only be made at a price within the price interval applicable from time to time on Nasdaq Stockholm  i.e. the interval between the highest buying price and the lowest selling price on Nasdaq Stockholm from time to time. The authorization may be exercised on one or more occasions until the Annual General Meeting in 2025.b. The transfer of Boliden's treasury shares to the Participants may take place under the following terms:A maximum of 100 000 shares in Boliden may be transferred free of charge to the Participants. The right to acquire shares in Boliden free of charge shall  with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  be granted to the Participants  with a right for each Participant to acquire a maximum number of shares in accordance with the terms of the Programme. Furthermore  with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  subsidiaries of Boliden shall be entitled to acquire shares in Boliden free of charge  whereby such company shall be obliged to  according to the terms of the Programme  immediately transfer the shares to the Participants. Transfers of shares in Boliden shall be made free of charge at the time and on the other terms and conditions that apply for allocation of shares to the Participants. The number of shares in Boliden that may be transferred under the Programme shall be subject to recalculation to take into account any intervening bonus issues  splits  rights issues  dividend exceeding 15 per cent of the Group's equity for a given financial year and/or other similar corporate events.The transfer of own shares is part of the proposed Programme and the Board of Directors considers it to be beneficial to Boliden and the shareholders that Participants in the Programme are offered the opportunity to become shareholders under the terms of the Programme.ii. Equity swap agreement with a third partyThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting  in the event that the required majority for item 21.b.i above cannot be reached  resolve to hedge the financial exposure that the Programme is expected to entail by enabling Boliden to enter into an equity swap agreement with a third party on terms in accordance with market practice  whereby the third party undertakes  in its own name and in exchange for a fee  to acquire and transfer shares in Boliden to the Participants in accordance with the terms of the Programme.Majority requirements  etc.The Annual General Meeting's resolution to implement the Programme in accordance with item 21.a. above is conditional upon the Annual General Meeting resolving either in accordance with the proposal under item 21.b.i or the proposal under item 21.b.ii.The Annual General Meeting's resolution under item 21.a above requires a simple majority of the votes cast. A valid resolution under item 21.b.i above requires that shareholders representing not less than nine-tenths of the votes cast as well as of the shares represented at the Annual General Meeting approve the resolution. A valid resolution under item 21.b.ii above requires a simple majority of the votes cast.Previous incentive programmesSince 2023  Boliden has a long-term share saving programme (LTIP 2023/2026) which is mainly based on the same conditions as the above proposed LTIP 2024/2027. LTIP 2023/2026 is described in more detail in note 5 in Boliden's annual report for the financial year 2023.-------------------Shares and VotesThe company's share capital amounts to SEK 578 914 338 distributed among 273 511 169 shares and votes.

The peer group may be adjusted as decided by the Board of Directors if the Board of Directors finds it appropriate.[3]Boliden aims to have 42 per cent lower absolute carbon dioxide emissions (Scope 1 and Scope 2 according to the Green-house Gas Protocol) in 2030 compared to the base year 2021.

The Programme is aimed at the CEO  members of the Group Management  General Managers and certain other key employees in the Boliden Group and shall be implemented after Boliden's Annual General Meeting in 2024.The overall purpose of the Programme is to maintain a close community of interest between employees and shareholders by incentivizing employees to increase the value of the company. The Programme is intended to attract and retain key employees. The Programme should be achievable  easy to understand  cost-effective to administer and easy to communicate.a) Implementation of the ProgrammeThe Board of Directors proposes to implement the Programme on the main terms set out below.The Programme is proposed to be directed to 40 permanent employees within the Boliden Group  which are divided into the following four categories: the CEO of Boliden ("" Group 1 "")  members of the Group Management (currently four persons) ("" Group 2 "")  General Managers (currently eleven persons) ("" Group 3 "") and 24 other pre-identified key persons in the Boliden Group ("" Group 4 ""). The participants in Groups 1-4 are together referred to as the "" Participants "". In order to participate in the Programme  the employees are required to personally invest in shares in Boliden  and that these shares are allocated to the Programme  or that shares already held in Boliden are allocated to the Programme [1]   no later than 30 September 2024   unless the Board of Directors decides to postpone the date ("" Investment Shares ""). The Investment Shares shall be retained throughout the Vesting Period (as defined below). For each Investment Share  the Participants have the possibility to  free of charge  either by Boliden  by another company in the Boliden Group or by a designated third party  be allotted a maximum of three (3) shares in Boliden conditional upon continued employment and uninterrupted holding of Investment Shares and fulfilment of certain performance conditions (as further described in section (d) below) ("" Performance Shares ""). The Performance Shares will be granted after the expiry of a vesting period  which runs from and including 1 June 2024 up to and including 31 May 2027 (the "" Vesting Period ""). The allotment of Performance Shares shall be dependent on the extent to which the performance conditions for the Programme have been fulfilled. The performance conditions shall consist of a financial target specific to the Programme related to the total shareholder return ("" TSR "") for Boliden's share (the "" TSR Condition "") and a sustainability target (the "" Sustainability Condition "")  as further described below. The TSR Condition will be weighted with 80 per cent and the Sustainability Condition with 20 per cent when determining the allotment of Performance Shares. After the end of the Vesting Period  the Board of Directors will publish the extent to which the TSR Condition and the Sustainability Condition have been fulfilled.The TSR Condition shall be related to the TSR of Boliden's share during a period of 20 trading days after Boliden's publication of the year-end report for the financial year 2023 compared to 20 trading days after Boliden's publication of the year-end report for the financial year 2026 (the "" Measurement Period "") in relation to the TSR of a peer group of other companies. [2]A condition for allotment of Performance Shares under the TSR Condition is that the TSR for Boliden's share exceeds the weighted TSR outcome for the peer group during the Measurement Period (the "" TSR Minimum Level ""). If the TSR Minimum Level is not achieved  no allotment of Performance Shares related to the TSR Condition will be made. For maximum allotment (100 per cent)  the TSR for Boliden's share must exceed the weighted TSR outcome for the peer group by at least 12.5 percentage points during the Measurement Period (the "" TSR Maximum Level ""). If the TSR for Boliden's share amounts to between the TSR Minimum Level and the TSR Maximum Level during the Measurement Period  a linear allocation is made.The Sustainability Condition shall be related to the reduction of Boliden's carbon dioxide emissions in absolute terms. A condition for allotment of Performance Shares under the Sustainability Condition is that Boliden's carbon dioxide emissions in absolute terms (Scope 1 and Scope 2 according to the Green-house Gas Protocol) during the financial year 2026 have been reduced by at least 15 per cent compared to Boliden's carbon dioxide emissions in absolute terms during the financial year 2021. [3] Participants in Group 1-2 may invest in Investment Shares at a value corresponding to a maximum of 15 per cent of the Participant's annual gross fixed base salary for 2023  adjusted for the increase in the income base amount in Sweden for 2024 compared to 2023. Participants in Group 3-4 may invest in Investment Shares at a value corresponding to a maximum of 10 per cent of the Participant's annual gross fixed base salary for 2023  adjusted for the increase in the income base amount in Sweden for 2024 compared to 2023. The number of Investment Shares that Participants may acquire is determined on the basis of the volume-weighted average share price of the Boliden share during a period of 20 trading days after Boliden's publication of the year-end report for the financial year 2023. Performance Shares may normally only be allotted after the end of the Vesting Period. The total value of Performance Shares allotted to Participants may not exceed 150 per cent of the Participant's annual individual gross fixed base salary for 2027 (the "" Cap ""). The value of the Performance Shares for calculation of the Cap is determined based on the volume weighted average share price of the Boliden share during a period of 20 trading days prior to the end of the Vesting Period. For a Participant to be allotted Performance Shares  it shall normally have been a permanent employee within the Boliden Group during the entire Vesting Period  and have retained the Investment Shares until the end of the Vesting Period. Investment Shares disposed of before the end of the Vesting Period shall not be included in the calculation for determining the allotment of Performance Shares. If there are significant changes in the Boliden Group or in the market which  in the opinion of the Board of Directors  would mean that the conditions for allotment of Performance Shares under the Programme are no longer reasonable  the Board of Directors shall be entitled to make adjustments to the Programme  including  inter alia  a right to resolve on a reduced allotment of Performance Shares  or that no allotment of Performance Shares shall take place at all. The Board of Directors shall be entitled to decide on the detailed terms and conditions of the Programme. In this respect  the Board of Directors shall be entitled to make necessary adjustments to these terms and conditions in order to fulfil specific rules or market conditions outside Sweden . Participation in the Programme is contingent upon such participation being legal in the relevant jurisdictions. Where  in the Board's opinion  Participants outside Sweden cannot be allotted Performance Shares at a reasonable cost or with reasonable administrative efforts  it shall be entitled to decide on a cash settlement for such Participants. The Programme shall comprise a maximum of 100 000 Performance Shares in Boliden. The number of Performance Shares shall be subject to recalculation to take into account any intervening bonus issues  splits  rights issues  dividend exceeding 15 per cent of the Group's equity for a given financial year and/or other similar corporate events.Costs of the Programme  etc.The costs for the Programme  which are recognized in the income statement  are calculated in accordance with the accounting standard IFRS 2 and are accrued over the Vesting Period. The calculation has been carried out based on the quoted closing price for shares in Boliden as of 29 December 2023  i.e. SEK 314.5 per share  and with the following assumptions: (i) an annual employee turnover of approximately 7 per cent  (ii) fulfilment of the TSR Condition of 100 per cent and fulfilment of the Sustainability Condition  (iii) all 40 Participants invest the maximum amount in the Programme  (iv) all remaining Participants are entitled to allotment of the maximum number of Performance Shares in the Programme  (v) a tax rate for social security contributions of 30 per cent under the Programme  and (vi) a total maximum of 100 000 Performance Shares available for allotment.Based on the above assumptions  the total costs for the Programme under IFRS 2 are estimated to amount to approximately SEK 17.1 million   excluding social security contributions. Assuming an annual share price increase of 15 per cent during the term of the Programme  the costs for social security contributions are estimated to amount to approximately SEK 11 million . Assuming instead an annual share price increase of 30 per cent during the duration of the Programme  the costs for social security contributions are estimated to amount to approximately SEK 15.9 million .Based on the above assumptions (and an annual share price increase of 15 per cent for calculation of the social security contributions)  the yearly costs are estimated to amount to approximately SEK 9.4 million   including social security contributions. This corresponds to approximately 0.2 per cent of the Boliden Group's total personnel costs for the financial year 2023.DilutionThe allotment of repurchased shares to fulfil the obligations under the Programme would result in the following dilution effects (under the assumptions stated below). At the maximum allotment of Performance Shares  the number of shares to be allotted free of charge in the Programme amounts to 100 000 shares in Boliden  which corresponds to approximately 0.04 per cent of the shares and votes (calculated based on the number of outstanding shares in Boliden as of 29 December 2023 ). The effects on key ratios and earnings per share are thus insignificant.Hedging arrangementsIn order to be able to implement the Programme in a cost-efficient and flexible manner  the Board of Directors has considered different methods for delivery of Performance Shares. The Board of Directors has thereby found the most cost-efficient alternative to be  and therefore proposes that the Annual General Meeting as the main alternative resolves on  repurchase and transfer of treasury shares. The Company currently holds 40 000 treasury shares. The detailed terms and conditions for the Board of Directors' main alternative are set out in section 21.b.i below.Should the required majority for item 21.b.i below not be reached  the Board of Directors proposes that Boliden shall be able to enter into equity swap agreements with third parties in accordance with item 21.b.ii below.Preparation of the proposalThe proposed Programme has  according to guidelines issued by Boliden's Board of Directors  been prepared by Boliden's Remuneration Committee  with the assistance of external advisors. The Remuneration Committee has presented the work to the Board of Directors  after which the Board of Directors has resolved to propose that the Programme is adopted at the Annual General Meeting 2024.-------------------b) Hedging arrangements in respect of the Programmei. Decisions on acquisitions and transfers of treasury sharesThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting (a) authorize the Board of Directors to resolve on acquisitions of treasury shares on Nasdaq Stockholm and (b) resolve that treasury shares may be transferred to the Participants in the Programme.a. The acquisition of treasury shares is subject to the following terms:Purchases of treasury shares may only be made on Nasdaq Stockholm. A maximum of 100 000 shares may be acquired to ensure delivery of shares to Participants. Acquisitions of shares in Boliden on Nasdaq Stockholm may only be made at a price within the price interval applicable from time to time on Nasdaq Stockholm  i.e. the interval between the highest buying price and the lowest selling price on Nasdaq Stockholm from time to time. The authorization may be exercised on one or more occasions until the Annual General Meeting in 2025.b. The transfer of Boliden's treasury shares to the Participants may take place under the following terms:A maximum of 100 000 shares in Boliden may be transferred free of charge to the Participants. The right to acquire shares in Boliden free of charge shall  with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  be granted to the Participants  with a right for each Participant to acquire a maximum number of shares in accordance with the terms of the Programme. Furthermore  with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  subsidiaries of Boliden shall be entitled to acquire shares in Boliden free of charge  whereby such company shall be obliged to  according to the terms of the Programme  immediately transfer the shares to the Participants. Transfers of shares in Boliden shall be made free of charge at the time and on the other terms and conditions that apply for allocation of shares to the Participants. The number of shares in Boliden that may be transferred under the Programme shall be subject to recalculation to take into account any intervening bonus issues  splits  rights issues  dividend exceeding 15 per cent of the Group's equity for a given financial year and/or other similar corporate events.The transfer of own shares is part of the proposed Programme and the Board of Directors considers it to be beneficial to Boliden and the shareholders that Participants in the Programme are offered the opportunity to become shareholders under the terms of the Programme.ii. Equity swap agreement with a third partyThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting  in the event that the required majority for item 21.b.i above cannot be reached  resolve to hedge the financial exposure that the Programme is expected to entail by enabling Boliden to enter into an equity swap agreement with a third party on terms in accordance with market practice  whereby the third party undertakes  in its own name and in exchange for a fee  to acquire and transfer shares in Boliden to the Participants in accordance with the terms of the Programme.Majority requirements  etc.The Annual General Meeting's resolution to implement the Programme in accordance with item 21.a. above is conditional upon the Annual General Meeting resolving either in accordance with the proposal under item 21.b.i or the proposal under item 21.b.ii.The Annual General Meeting's resolution under item 21.a above requires a simple majority of the votes cast. A valid resolution under item 21.b.i above requires that shareholders representing not less than nine-tenths of the votes cast as well as of the shares represented at the Annual General Meeting approve the resolution. A valid resolution under item 21.b.ii above requires a simple majority of the votes cast.Previous incentive programmesSince 2023  Boliden has a long-term share saving programme (LTIP 2023/2026) which is mainly based on the same conditions as the above proposed LTIP 2024/2027. LTIP 2023/2026 is described in more detail in note 5 in Boliden's annual report for the financial year 2023.-------------------Shares and VotesThe company's share capital amounts to SEK 578 914 338 distributed among 273 511 169 shares and votes.

37723,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.lewrockwell.com/2024/03/no_author/will-brics-launch-a-new-world-in-2024/,Will BRICS Launch a New World in 2024?,MOSCOW – Across the Global South  countries are lining up to join the multipolar BRICS and the Hegemon-free future it promises. The onslaught of interest has become an unavoidable theme of discussion during this crucial year of the Russian presidency of what …,MOSCOW – Across the Global South  countries are lining up to join the multipolar BRICS and the Hegemon-free future it promises. The onslaught of interest has become an unavoidable theme of discussion during this crucial year of the Russian presidency of what  for the moment  is BRICS-10.Indonesia and Nigeria are among the top tiers of candidates likely to join. The same applies to Pakistan and Vietnam. Mexico is in a very complex bind: how to join without summoning the ire of the Hegemon.And then there’s the new candidacy on a roll: Yemen  which enjoys plenty of support from Russia  China  and Iran.It’s been up to Russia’s top BRICS sherpa  the immensely capable Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov  to clarify what’s ahead. He tells TASS: Survival of the Riches... Jeffries  Donald Best Price: $13.69 Buy New $12.79 (as of 03:45 UTC - Details)We must provide a platform for the countries interested in rapprochement with the BRICS  where they will be able to work practically without feeling left behind and joining this cooperation rhythm. And as to how the further expansion will be decided upon – this should be postponed at least until the leaders convene in Kazan to decide.The key decision on BRICS+ expansion will only come out of the Kazan summit next October. Ryabkov stresses that the order of the day is first “to integrate those who have just joined.” This means that “as a ‘ten ’ we work at least as efficiently  or  rather  more efficiently than we did within the initial ‘five.'”Only then will the BRICS-10 “develop the category of partner states ” which  in fact  means creating a consensus-based list out of the dozens of nations that are literally itching to join the club.Ryabkov always makes a point to note  in public and in private  that the twofold increase of BRICS members starting on 1 January 2024 is “an unprecedented event for any international structure.”It isn’t an easy task  Ryabkov says:Last year  it took an entire year to develop the admission  expansion criteria at the level of top officials. Many reasonable things were developed. And many of the things that were formulated back then got reflected in the list of countries that joined. But it would probably be improper to formalize the requirements. At the end of the day  an admission to the association is a subject of political decision.What happens after Russia’s presidential electionsIn a private meeting with a few select individuals on the sidelines of the recent multipolar conference in Moscow  Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov spoke effusively of BRICS  with particular emphasis on his counterparts Wang Yi of China and S. Jaishankar of India.Lavrov holds great expectations for BRICS-10 this year – at the same time  reminding everyone that this is still a club; it must eventually go deeper in institutional terms  for instance  by appointing a secretariat-general  just like its cousin-style organization  the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO).The Russian presidency will have its hands full for the next few months  not only navigating the geopolitical spectrum of current crises but  most of all  geoeconomics. A crucial ministerial meeting in June – only three months away – will have to define a detailed road map all the way to the Kazan summit four months later.What happens after this week’s Russian presidential elections will also condition BRICS policy. A new Russian government will be sworn in only by early May. It is widely expected that there will be no substantial changes within the Russian Finance Ministry  Central Bank  Foreign Ministry  and among top Kremlin advisers.Continuity will be the norm.And that brings us to the key geoeconomics dossier: the BRICS at the forefront of bypassing the US dollar in international finance.Last week  top Kremlin adviser Yury Ushakov announced that BRICS will work towards setting up an independent payment system based on digital currencies and blockchain.Ushakov specifically emphasized “state-of-the-art tools such as digital technologies and blockchain. The main thing is to make sure it is convenient for governments  common people  and businesses  as well as cost-effective and free of politics.”Ushakov did not mention it explicitly  but a new alternative system already exists. For the moment  it is a closely  carefully guarded project in the form of a detailed white paper that has already been validated academically and also incorporates answers to possible frequently asked questions.The Cradle was briefed on the system via several meetings since last year with a small group of world-class fintech experts. The system has already been presented to Ushakov himself. As it stands  it is on the verge of receiving a final green light from the Russian government. After clearing a series of tests  the system in thesis would be ready to be presented to all BRICS-10 members before the Kazan summit.This all ties in with Ushakov publicly declaring that a specific task for 2024 is to increase the role of BRICS in the international monetary/ financial system.Ushakov recalls how  in the 2023 Johannesburg Declaration  the BRICS heads of state focused on increasing settlements in national currencies and strengthening correspondent banking networks. The target was to “continue to develop the Contingent Reserve Arrangement  primarily regarding the use of currencies different from the US dollar.”No single currency for the foreseeable futureAll of the above frames the absolute key issue being currently discussed in Moscow  within the Russia–China partnership  and soon  deeper among the BRICS-10: alternative settlement payments to the US dollar  increased trade among “friendly nations ” and controls on capital flight.Ryabkov added more crucial elements to the debate  saying this week that the BRICS are not debating the implementation of a single currency:As for a single currency  similar to what was created by the European Union  this is hardly possible in the foreseeable future. If we are talking about clearing forms of mutual settlements such as the ECU [European Currency Unit] at an early stage of development of the European Union  in the absence of a real means of payment  but the opportunity to more effectively use the available resources of the countries in mutual settlements to avoid losses due to differences in exchange rates  and so on  then this is precisely the path along which  in my opinion  BRICS should move. This is under consideration.The key takeaway  per Ryabkov  is that the BRICS should not create a financial and monetary alliance; they should create payment and settlement systems that do not depend upon the shifty “rules-based international order.”That’s exactly the emphasis of the ideas and experiments already developed by Minister of Integration and Macroeconomy at the Eurasia Economic Union (EAEU) Sergei Glazyev  as he explained in an exclusive interview  as well as the new groundbreaking project on the verge of being greenlighted by the Russian government.Ryabkov confirmed that “a group of experts  led by the Ministries of Finance and representatives of the Central Banks of the respective [BRICS] countries ” is working nonstop on the dossier. Moreover  there are “consultations in other formats  including with the participation of representatives of the ‘historical west.'”Ryabkov’s own takeaway mirrors what the BRICS as a whole are aiming at:Collectively  we must come up with a product that would be  on the one hand  quite ambitious (because it is impossible to continue to tolerate the dictates of the west in this area)  but at the same time realistic  not out of touch with the ground. That is  a product that would be efficient. And all this should be presented in Kazan for consideration by the leaders.In a nutshell: the big breakthrough may be literally knocking at the BRICS door. It just depends on a simple green light by the Russian government. Why Has Nobody Told Me... Smith  Dr. Julie Best Price: $9.00 Buy New $15.25 (as of 02:37 UTC - Details)Now compare the BRICS devising the contours of a new geoeconomics paradigm with the collective west mulling the actual theft of Russia’s seized assets to the benefit of the black hole that is Ukraine.Apart from being a de facto declaration by the US and EU against Russia  this is something that carries the potential  in itself  of totally smashing the current global financial system.A theft of Russian assets  would it ever happen  will render livid  to put it mildly  at least two key BRICS members  China and Saudi Arabia  who bring to the table considerable economic heft. Such a move by the west would completely destroy the concept of the rule of law  which theoretically underpins the global financial system.The Russian response will be fierce. The Russian Central Bank could  in a flash  sue and confiscate the assets of Belgian Euroclear  one of the world’s largest settlement and clearing systems  on whose accounts Russian reserves were frozen.And that on top of seizing Euroclear’s assets in Russia – which amount to roughly 33 billion euros. With Euroclear running out of capital  the Belgian Central Bank will have to revoke its license  causing a massive financial crisis.Talk about a clash of paradigms: western robbery versus a Global South-based equitable trade and finance settlement system.The views expressed in this article do not necessarily reflect those of The Cradle.,neutral,0.04,0.94,0.02,mixed,0.38,0.34,0.28,True,English,"['New World', 'BRICS', '2024', 'capable Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov', 'Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov', 'international monetary/ financial system', 'Donald Best Price', 'detailed road map', 'detailed white paper', 'world-class fintech experts', 'final green light', 'top Kremlin advisers', 'recent multipolar conference', 'independent payment system', 'Many reasonable things', 'Shanghai Cooperation Organization', 'crucial ministerial meeting', 'new alternative system', 'new Russian government', 'Russian presidential elections', 'Russian Finance Ministry', 'key geoeconomics dossier', 'top BRICS sherpa', 'Foreign Ministry', 'international finance', 'new candidacy', 'international structure', 'top tiers', 'top officials', 'crucial year', 'Russian presidency', 'cooperation rhythm', 'key decision', 'cousin-style organization', 'Global South', 'Hegemon-free future', 'unavoidable theme', 'complex bind', 'initial ‘five', 'partner states', 'twofold increase', 'unprecedented event', 'easy task', 'entire year', 'political decision', 'private meeting', 'select individuals', 'particular emphasis', 'Wang Yi', 'S.

The chairman of the board shall as soon as possible after the end of August enable the four largest shareholders to form the nomination committee. The names of these four members and the names of the shareholders whom they are appointed by  shall be announced no later than six months before an annual general meeting. If any of the four largest shareholder declines to participate in the nomination committee  the next largest shareholder is entitled to appoint a member of the nomination committee.The members' term of office shall end when a new nomination committee has been appointed. Provided that the members of the nomination committee do not agree otherwise  the member representing the largest shareholder by votes shall be appointed chairman of the nomination committee.Should a shareholder that has appointed a member of the nomination committee  during the term of office of the nomination committee  no longer be one of the four largest shareholders by votes  and the shareholder that has become one of the four largest shareholders requests to become a member of the nomination committee  the member that has been appointed by the shareholder no longer being one of the four largest shareholders shall resign from its assignment and the shareholder that at such time has become one of the four largest shareholders shall appoint its member for the nomination committee.

Further  an incentive programme will contribute to the ability of the company to retain and recruit key employees within the group.Considering the above  the board proposes a long-term performance based incentive programme (""LTI 2024"") under which senior executives and key employees will be entitled to receive performance shares that entitle the participants to receive shares in the company under the terms and conditions set out below. The board's intention is that the incentive programme will run over a long-term period  thus the board intends to propose the general meeting in the coming years to resolve upon similar incentive programmes.To be able to implement LTI 2024 in a cost-efficient and flexible manner  the board has considered various methods for transferring shares under LTI 2024  such as repurchase and transfer of own shares to participants in LTI 2024  transfer of warrants entitling to subscription of new shares  or share swap agreement with a third party. The board has also taken into consideration that delivery of shares under LTI 2024 will be made no earlier than 2027. In order to retain full flexibility  the board proposes that shares can be delivered with any of the above three alternate methods (in accordance with the proposals below and the board's proposal on directed issue and transfer of warrants and the board's proposal on acquisition and transfer of own shares to participants in LTI 2024  with the right for the board to combine or choose any of the methods.The proposalConcentric has implemented LTI programmes on an annual basis since 2012. The LTI programmes have enabled Concentric to offer a competitive total reward package necessary to attract and retain employees who are critical to Concentric's ongoing success.The board proposes that the general meeting resolve on the implementation of a long-term incentive programme  LTI 2024  principally based on the following conditions and principles.1. LTI 2024 shall comprise the CEO  up to 11 senior executives and 25 other key employees (total of 37 employees).2. Each participant will free of charge receive a performance share award under LTI 2024 (""LTIP Award"") entitling the participant to receive an allocation of a number of Concentric shares free of charge from Concentric or from a designated third party  subject to the satisfaction of the performance conditions set out under the heading ""Performance criteria"" below  as well as the condition in item 5 below (""Performance Shares"").3. Any Performance Shares will be allocated after the expiration of the three-year vesting period  which begins on the date decided by Concentric and notified to the participant in LTI 2024 and continues until the day of publication of the interim report for Q1 of the 2027 financial year (the ""Vesting Period""). Offer of participation in LTI 2024 can be offered up to and including May 31  2024 .4. Within LTI 2024  the value of the underlying shares at the time of grant in respect of each LTIP Award will amount to (i) for the CEO a value of up to 100 per cent of his annual base salary  (ii) for 11 other senior executives a value of up to 40 per cent of their respective annual base salary  and (iii) for a total of 25 other key employees a value of up to 20 per cent of their respective annual base salary. References to the annual base salary means the participant's base salary effective from April 1   2024.The share price used to calculate the value of the underlying shares in respect of each LTIP Award  and hence the number of shares to which each LTIP Award entitles  shall be SEK 166.10 (""Input Value"")  which equals to the average of each trading day's volume weighted average share price on Nasdaq Stockholm during the period from February 8  2024   to February 21  2024   (inclusive) rounded to the nearest ten öre.5. Receiving the Performance Shares is subject to the participant remaining employed in the Concentric group (with certain exceptions decided by the board) throughout the three-year lock-up period  thus up to and including the date of receiving the Performance Shares.6. The board shall be authorised to resolve on a premature allocation of the Performance Shares (i) if a person  alone or together with related parties  acquires such number of shares in the company that it  in accordance with applicable rules  gives rise to an obligation to announce a mandatory offer to acquire all outstanding shares in the company or (ii) for individual participants based on individual circumstances  or (iii) if premature allocation is otherwise deemed to be suitable or appropriate  taking into account performance achieved to the date of premature allocation.7. The number of Performance Shares that may be transferred to participants in LTI 2024 may be recalculated due to a bonus issue  share split  rights issue and/or any similar event  by applying the recalculation principles applicable on the warrants proposed to the general meeting under the board's proposal on directed issue of warrants. In addition  the board may adjust the performance criteria due to circumstances affecting comparability of key figures  e.g. non-recurring events such as acquisitions  divestments and similar.8. The board shall decide on the detailed terms and conditions of LTI 2024. The board shall be entitled to deviate from or adjust the terms and conditions as a result of local regulations and practice.9. LTI 2024 comprises a maximum of 154 260 Performance Shares.Performance criteriaThe portion (if any) of an LTIP Award that will vest at the end of the Vesting Period is based on and subject to the satisfaction of the performance conditions set out below during the 2024  2025  and 2026 financial years  i.e. during the period January 1  2024   up to and including December 31  2026 (""Performance Period""). The percentage weighting between the different performance conditions is stated below and the outcome for each performance condition will be determined individually. This means  inter alia  that all performance conditions do not have to be fulfilled for allocation of Performance Shares to take place.Earnings per share40 per cent of the allocation under an LTIP Award will depend on the accumulated earnings per Concentric share (""EPS"") during the Performance Period. The Board of Directors will determine a minimum and maximum level  which will be disclosed after expiry of LTI 2024. If the minimum level is reached  an allocation of 25 per cent related to EPS will occur. If the maximum level is reached or exceeded  a full allocation related to EPS will occur. If the outcome is between the minimum level and the maximum level  a linear allocation related to EPS will occur. If the minimum level is not reached  no allocation related to the EPS will occur.Return on capital employed40 per cent of the allocation under an LTIP Award will depend on the average return on capital employed (""ROCE"") during the years covered by the Performance Period. The Board of Directors will determine a minimum and maximum level  which will be disclosed after expiry of LTI 2024. If the minimum level is reached  an allocation of 25 per cent related to ROCE will occur. If the maximum level is reached or exceeded  a full allocation related to ROCE will occur. If the outcome is between the minimum level and the maximum level  a linear allocation related to ROCE will occur. If the minimum level is not reached  no allocation related to the ROCE will occur.Sustainability20 per cent of the allocation under an LTIP Award will depend on the revenue from the sale of electrical products as a percentage of total group revenue (""ESG Target"") at the end of the final year of the Performance Period. The Board of Directors will determine a minimum and maximum level  which will be disclosed after expiry of LTI 2024. If the minimum level is reached  an allocation of 25 per cent related to the ESG Target will occur. If the maximum level is reached or exceeded  a full allocation related to ESG Target will occur. If the outcome is between the minimum level and the maximum level  a linear allocation related to ESG Target will occur. If the minimum level is not reached  no allocation related to the ESG Target will occur.Authorisation to enter into a swap agreementThe company's supply of shares to the participants under LTI 2024 may be made by instructing a third party to deliver Concentric shares under a swap agreement.In accordance with this  the board proposes that the general meeting resolve to authorise the board to enter into a swap agreement regarding own shares. Thus  it is proposed that the financial exposure of LTI 2024 may be hedged by the company entering into a share swap agreement with a third party  whereby the third party in its own name shall acquire and transfer Concentric shares to participants in LTI 2024.CostsThe LTI 2024 may result in annual costs of no more than MSEK 8.5 for the company if the performance criteria are fully met  and an annual 15 per cent share price growth is assumed. In addition to this  social security charges will apply upon allocation of the Performance Shares  in the year 2027. Social security charges may amount to no more than MSEK 1.8 annually  based on the above assumptions.Preparation of the matterThe board's proposal on LTI 2024 has been prepared by the board.Resolution on a directed issue of warrants and approval of transfer of warrants (item 17)The board proposes that the general meeting resolve on a directed issue of warrants with the right to subscribe for new shares in the company  in accordance with the below proposal.The board's proposal entails that the general meeting shall decide on a directed issue of 154 260 warrants with the right to subscription of new shares in the company  principally in accordance with the following conditions.1. The warrants are issued free of charge. Each warrant will give the right to subscribe for one new share in the company  thus the share capital of the company can increase with a maximum of SEK 391 820.4 if the warrants are fully utilised.2. The right to subscribe for warrants shall  with a deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  be granted the company's fully owned subsidiary Concentric Skånes Fagerhult AB.3. Subscription to the warrants shall be made no later than June 30  2024   with the board reserving the right to extend this time limit.4. The warrants can be exercised to subscribe for shares in the company from the registration of the warrants with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and up to and including December 31  2027.5. A warrant entitles its holder to subscribe for one new share in the company for a subscription price corresponding to the share's quota value.6. The new shares issued under the warrants shall entitle to dividend as from the first record date for dividend to occur after the registration of the new shares with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.7. The number of shares issued under each warrant may be recalculated in accordance with recalculation principles due to a bonus issue  share split or consolidation  rights issue and/or any similar event.Reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rightThe reason for deviating from the shareholders' preferential rights is that the company wishes to implement an incentive program for senior executives and key employees within the group  by which they can be offered the opportunity to take part in an increase in the company's share value.DilutionAt full utilisation of the warrants  the number of outstanding shares in the company will increase by 154 260. These shares constitute 0.4 per cent of the number of shares and votes after full dilution  calculated as the number of new shares in relation to the number of existing and new shares in the company. Together with outstanding warrants under previous incentive programs  the warrants will result in a combined dilution of approximately 0.5 per cent of the outstanding shares and votes in the company.If the proposed warrants had been fully utilised throughout 2023  the company's basic and diluted earnings per share for the financial year 2023 would have been SEK 11.00 and SEK 10.95 per share respectively on a pro forma basis  instead of SEK 11.00 and SEK 11.00 per share respectively as reported.In the event that repurchased shares  or shares transferred by a third party under a swap agreement  (in accordance with the board's proposal for acquisition and transfer of own shares and the board's proposal of LTI 2024  respectively) are fully or partly transferred to the participants in LTI 2024 instead of warrants  the dilution will be reduced.Transfer of the warrantsFurthermore  the board proposes that the general meeting resolve to approve that Concentric Skånes Fagerhult AB  on one or more occasions  may transfer warrants to a third party for reassignment of shares to the participants in LTI 2024 in accordance with the terms and conditions of LTI 2024  and dispose of the warrants in order to cover costs related to  or fulfil obligations occurring under  LTI 2024.Preparation of the matterThe board's proposal has been prepared by the board.Special authorisationThe board proposes that the board  or anyone appointed by the board  shall be entitled to make the minor adjustments to the above proposed resolution that may be necessary upon registration of the resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office or due to any other formal requirement.The board proposes that a resolution under this proposal be subject to the general meeting having resolved to pass the board's proposal on LTI 2024 under item 16 on the agenda.Resolution on authorisation for the board to resolve on acquisition of own shares  authorisation for the board to resolve on transfer of own shares  and transfer of own shares to participants in LTI 2024 (items 18.a-18.c)Proposal for a resolution on authorisation for the board to resolve on acquisition of own shares (item 18.a)The board proposes that the general meeting authorises the board to resolve on repurchase of own shares on one or several occasions during the period up to the annual general meeting 2025 in accordance with the following.1. Acquisition of own shares must be made on Nasdaq Stockholm.2. Own shares may be acquired to the extent the company's holdings of own shares in total amounts to no more than one tenth of all shares in the company.3. Acquisition of own shares on Nasdaq Stockholm shall be made in cash and at a price within the stock market price interval registered at any given time  such interval being the interval between the highest purchase price and the lowest sales price.The reasons for the proposed authorisation to repurchase own shares are to be able to improve the company's capital structure and to enable share transfers in accordance with the board's proposals for authorisation for the board to transfer own shares and for previous and proposed resolution on transfer of own shares to participants in LTI 2021-2024  to increase the flexibility for the board in connection to potential future corporate acquisitions  as well as to cover costs for LTI 2021-2024 and enable delivery of shares in accordance with LTI 2021-2024. References made to LTI 2021-2022 includes the JSOP and Employee Share Ownership Trust.Proposal for a resolution on authorisation for the board to resolve on transfer of own shares (item 18.b)The board proposes that the general meeting authorises the board to resolve on transfer of own shares on one or several occasions during the period up to the annual general meeting 2025 in accordance with the following.1. Transfer of own shares must be made either on Nasdaq Stockholm or in another manner.2. Transfer of own shares may be made with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights.3. The maximum number of shares that may be transferred is the total number of own shares held by the company at the time of the board's resolution to transfer the shares.4. Transfer of own shares on Nasdaq Stockholm shall be made at a price within the stock market price interval registered at any given time  such interval being the interval between the highest purchase price and the lowest sales price; transfer of own shares in another manner shall be made at a minimum price that shall be determined in close connection with the shares' quoted price at the time of the board's resolution to transfer the shares.5. Payment for the transferred shares may be made in cash  by contribution in kind or by set-off.6. The board is entitled to determine the other terms and conditions of the transfer which  however  shall be in accordance with the market practice.The reasons for the proposed authorisation to transfer own shares and for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights are to be able to improve the company's capital structure  to cover costs relating to LTI 2021-2024 (including costs related to the JSOP) as well as to increase the flexibility of the board in connection to potential future corporate acquisitions  by facilitating a fast and cost-efficient financing by divesting holdings of own shares.Proposal for a resolution on transfer of own shares to participants in LTI 2024 (item 18.c)The board proposes that the general meeting resolve on transfer of own shares in accordance with the following.1. The maximum number of shares that may be transferred is 154 260.2. The participants in LTI 2024 are  with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  entitled to receive the shares with right for each of the participants to receive no more than the maximum number of shares allowed under the terms and conditions for LTI 2024.3. The participants' right to receive shares is conditional upon the fulfilment of all of the conditions set up in LTI 2024.4. The shares must be transferred within the time period set out in the terms and conditions of LTI 2024.5. The shares shall be transferred free of charge as established under the terms and conditions of LTI 2024.6. The number of shares that may be transferred to the participants in LTI 2024 may be recalculated due to bonus issue  share split  rights issue and similar events in accordance with the terms and conditions of LTI 2024.The reason for the proposed transfer and for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights is to enable delivery of shares under LTI 2024.The board proposes that a resolution under this proposal be subject to the general meeting having resolved to pass the board's proposal on LTI 2024 under item 16 on the agenda.Majority requirementsResolutions under items 18.a (authorisation for the board to resolve on acquisition of own shares) and 18.b (authorisation for the board to resolve on transfer of own shares) will not be valid unless supported by shareholders representing at least two thirds of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the general meeting.Resolutions under items 17 (directed issue of warrants and approval of transfer of warrants) and 18.c (transfer of own shares to participants in LTI 2024) will not be valid unless supported by shareholders representing at least nine tenths of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the general meeting.DocumentsAll documents in accordance with the Swedish Companies Act (2005:551) will be available at the company's legal counsel  Advokatfirman Lindahl  at Smålandsgatan 16 in Stockholm and on the company's website www.concentricab.com no later than as from Thursday  March 28  2024   and will be sent  immediately and free of charge to the recipient  to those shareholders who so request and state their postal address.InformationIf so requested by any shareholder and if the board deems it possible without significant detriment to the company  the board and CEO must provide information at the general meeting about circumstances that may affect the assessment of an item on the agenda  circumstances that can affect the assessment of the company's or its subsidiaries' financial situation  the group accounts and the company's relation to other companies within the group.

The articles of association  § 4  will thereby have the following wording:""The share capital shall not be less than SEK 11 153 000 and not more than SEK 44 612 000.""It is proposed that the articles of associations limits for the number of shares is amended from a minimum of 33 585 596 and not more than 134 342 384 to a minimum of 111 530 000 and not more than 446 120 000. The articles of association  § 5  will thereby have the following wording:""The number of shares shall not be less than 111 530 000 and not more than 446 120 000.""It is proposed to introduce a new share class called C shares  which entitle holders to one tenth of a vote per share. C shares do not entitle to dividends. C shares can  following a resolution by the board of directors  be redeemed at the quota value of the share or be converted into ordinary shares. The articles of association will thereby have a new § 5 a and a new § 5 b with the following wording:§ 5 a Share classesThe shares may be issued in two classes  ordinary shares and C shares. Ordinary shares may be issued in a maximum number corresponding to not more than 100 percent of the total number of shares in the company and C shares may be issued in a maximum number corresponding to not more than 1.0 percent of the total number of shares in the company. Each ordinary share shall entitle the holder to one (1) vote and each C share shall entitle the holder to one-tenth (1/10) of a vote.Ordinary shares shall entitle to dividends. C shares shall not entitle to dividends. Upon the company's liquidation  C shares shall carry an equal right to the company's assets as ordinary shares  however not to an amount exceeding up to the quota value of the share.If the company resolves to issue new ordinary shares and C shares against cash or set-off of claim  owners of ordinary shares and C shares shall have a preferential right to subscribe for new shares of the same class of shares in proportion to their existing shareholdings (primary preferential right). Shares that are not subscribed for with primary preferential right shall be offered to all shareholders for subscription (subsidiary preferential right).Unless the shares thus offered are sufficient for the subscription under the secondary preferential right  the shares shall be allocated between the subscribers in proportion to the number of shares they already hold and  to the extent this is not possible  by drawing of lots.If the company resolves to issue only ordinary shares or C shares against cash or set-off of claim  all shareholders shall have a preferential right to subscribe for new shares in proportion to the number of shares they already hold  irrespective of whether they hold ordinary shares or C shares.The above shall not imply any restriction in the possibility to decide on a new share issue against cash or set-off of claim  with deviation from the shareholders' preferential right. What is stated above about the shareholders' preferential rights shall apply mutatis mutandis for new issues of warrants and convertibles not made against contribution in kind.If the share capital is increased through a bonus issue  new shares shall be issued of each class of shares in proportion to the existing number of shares of the same class. Old shares of a certain class of shares shall entail a right to new shares of the same class of shares in relation to their proportion of the share capital. The above shall not imply any restriction in the possibility to carry out a bonus issue and  after necessary change in the articles of association  issue new shares of a new class.§ 5 b Redemption and conversion of C sharesThe board may resolve on reduction of the share capital by redemption of all outstanding C shares. In case of a resolution on redemption  holders of C shares shall be obliged to redeem all C shares against a redemption amount corresponding to the share's quota value. Payment of the redemption amount shall be made as soon as possible.C shares held by the company itself may  upon request by the board  be reclassified into ordinary shares. Immediately thereafter  the board shall report the reclassification to the Swedish Companies Registration Office (Sw. Bolagsverket) for registration. The reclassification is effected when it has been registered in the Swedish Register of Companies and the reclassification has been noted in the Swedish Central Securities Depository Register.""It is proposed to introduce a new provision stating that a general meeting may be held in the municipality of Stockholm and that the board of directors may resolve that a general meeting shall be held digitally. The articles of association will thereby have a new § 9 with the following wording (whereby subsequent provisions are renumbered):§ 9 Place for holding a general meeting and digital meetingA general meeting of the shareholders is to be held at the registered office of the company or in the municipality of Stockholm. The board of directors may also resolve that the general meeting shall be held digitally in accordance with the provisions of chapter 7 section 15 of the Swedish Companies Act (2005:551).""It is further proposed that the board of directors or a person appointed by the board of directors shall be authorized to make such minor adjustments in the above resolution that may be required in connection with the registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.Resolution to introduce a new class of shares by introducing a new § 5 a and a new § 5 b in the articles of association is conditional upon that the annual general meeting resolves to implement a long-term incentive program in accordance with item 14. This condition does not apply to the other proposed amendments of the articles of association.Item 13: Resolution regarding authorization for the board of directors to issue shares and/or warrantsThe board of directors of the Company proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to authorize the board of directors during the period up until the next annual general meeting to  on one or more occasions  resolve to issue shares and/or warrants  with or without preferential rights for the shareholders  in the amount not exceeding ten (10) percent of the total number of shares in the Company at the time when the authorization is used the first time  to be paid in cash  in kind and/or by way of set-off.The purpose for the board to resolve on issuances with deviation from the shareholders preferential rights in accordance with the above is primarily for the purpose to raise new capital to increase flexibility of the Company and possibility to advance the development of the Company's satellite projects or in connection with acquisitions.Issuances of new shares under the authorization shall be made on customary terms and conditions based on current market conditions. If the board of directors finds it suitable in order to enable delivery of shares in connection with a issuance as set out above it may be made at a subscription price corresponding to the shares quota value.The board of directors or a person appointed by the board of directors shall be authorized to make such minor adjustments in the above resolution that may be required in connection with the registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.Item 14: Resolution regarding implementation of a long-term incentive programThe board of directors of the Company proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to implement a long-term incentive program (""LTIP 2024""). The proposal is divided into four items:A. Terms of LTIP 2024.B. Hedging measures regarding LTIP 2024 in the form of newly issued class C shares.C. Hedging of LTIP 2024 via an equity swap agreement with a third party.D. Other matters related to LTIP 2024.14.a: Terms of LTIP 2024The board of directors want to implement a long-term incentive program for present and future senior executives and other employees in the Company or its subsidiaries  in order to encourage a personal long-term ownership in the Company  and in order to increase and strengthen the potential for recruiting  retaining and motivating such senior executives and other employees. Therefore  the board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting approves the implementation of LTIP 2024 for present and future senior executives and other employees in the Company or its subsidiaries.Participants will  after a qualifying period and assuming an investment of their own in Ovzon Shares (defined below)  receive allotment of Ovzon Shares without consideration. The number of allotted Ovzon Shares will depend on the number of Ovzon Shares that they have purchased themselves and on the fulfilment of certain performance requirements. Ovzon Shares are ordinary shares in the Company (""Ovzon Shares""). The term of LTIP 2024 is more than three years.A.2: Basic features of LTIP 2024LTIP 2024 will be directed towards present and future senior executives and other employees in the Company or its subsidiaries. The participants are based in Sweden and other countries where the Ovzon Group is active. Participation in LTIP 2024 assumes that the participant acquires and locks Ovzon Shares into LTIP 2024 (""Savings Shares""). Savings Shares shall be newly acquired Ovzon Shares.For each acquired Savings Share  the participant shall be entitled to  after a certain vesting period (defined below)  provided continued employment during the entire vesting period and dependent on the fulfilment of certain performance requirements during the financial years 2024-2026  receive allotment of Ovzon Shares (""Performance Shares"").The performance requirements are linked to the Company's Earnings per Shares (""EPS"") and Total Shareholder Return (""TSR""). The participant shall not pay any consideration for the allotted Performance Shares. Performance Shares are Ovzon Shares.A.3: Participation in LTIP 2024LTIP 2024 is directed towards not more than 45 present and future senior executives and other employees in the Company or its subsidiaries  divided into three categories of participants:A. The managing director consisting of a maximum of 1 individual will be entitled to subscribe for a maximum of 24 000 Savings Shares and a maximum of 8 Performance Shares per Savings Share.B. The group management team consisting of a maximum of 6 individuals will each be entitled to subscribe for a maximum of 19 000 Savings Shares and a maximum of 6 Performance shares per Savings Share.C. Other employees consisting of a maximum of 38 individuals will each be entitled to subscribe for a maximum of 13 000 Savings Shares and a maximum of 2 Performance shares per Savings Share.To be eligible to participate in LTIP 2024  the participant must invest in Savings Shares for an amount corresponding to between three (3) and five (5) percent of the participant's fixed base salary for the current year  however  not exceeding the number of Savings Shares that the participant can tie up within the scope of LTIP 2024 according to the above.New senior executives and other employees who are hired by the Company or its subsidiaries after the end of the initial application period may be offered to participate in LTIP 2024. The remaining term of LTIP 2024 may be less than three years upon the inclusion of such new senior executives and other employees into LTIP 2024. The reason for the inclusion of new senior executives and other employees after the end of the initial application period is that it is considered to be of great value for the Company and its subsidiaries to quickly integrate new senior executives and other employees into a corresponding incentive structure that applies to other senior executives and employees covered by LTIP 2024. However  the inclusion of new senior executives and other employees into LTIP 2024 must not occur later than 31 December 2024.Any resolution on participation or implementation of LTIP 2024 shall be conditional on that it  in the board of directors' judgement  can be offered with reasonable administrative costs and financial effects.A.4: Allotment of Performance SharesAllotment of Performance Shares within LTIP 2024 will be made during a limited period of time following the annual general meeting 2027  however  no later than 31 July 2027. The period up until allotment is referred to as the qualification period (vesting period).If the participant and/or the Company is prevented from carrying out the allotment of Performance Shares due to  for example  insider information  the Company has the right to extend the period for allotment so that it runs until a date when such obstacle has ceased and allotment can take place.In order for the participant to be entitled to receive allotment of Performance Shares  it is assumed that the participant remains an employee of the Ovzon Group during the full qualification period up until allotment and that the participant  during this period  has kept all Savings Shares. Allotment of Performance Shares requires that the EPS and/or TSR performance requirements are fulfilled.The participant can receive allotment of the number of Performance Shares per Savings Share set out in the table above. Of the maximum number of Performance Shares that can be allotted per Savings Share  fifty (50) percent of the Performance Shares shall be linked to the fulfilment of the performance requirement regarding EPS  and fifty (50) percent of the Performance Shares shall be linked to the fulfilment of the performance requirement regarding TSR. The two performance requirements will be determined by the board of directors with a minimum and a maximum level for each performance requirement. For stock market and competitive reasons  the minimum and maximum levels for each performance requirement are not specified. No allotment of Performance Shares linked to a certain performance requirement will take place below the minimum level for such performance requirement. Full allotment of Performance Shares linked to a certain performance requirement will take place at or above the maximum level of such a performance requirement. The number of Performance Shares that can be allotted increases linearly between the minimum and maximum level for each performance requirement.A.4.1: Earnings per share (EPS) (weighting 50 percent)The performance requirement is based on the Ovzon Group's Earnings per Share during the financial year 2026.A.4.2: Total shareholder return (TSR) (weighting 50 percent)The performance requirement is the average annual total shareholder return per Ovzon Share based on the volume-weighted average price according to Nasdaq Stockholm's official price list for the Ovzon Share during the first 180 trading days that directly follows the annual general meeting 2024 compared with the volume-weighted average price according to Nasdaq Stockholm's official price list for the Ovzon Share during the 180 trading days immediately preceding the annual general meeting 2027  i.e. a calculation of the increase in percentages in the share price for the Ovzon Share  whereby the closing price has been calculated to take into account any dividends paid during the above-mentioned time period according to the current methodology used when calculating total shareholder return.A.4.3: Limitation of allotment etc.Before allotment of Performance Shares  the board of directors shall assess whether the allotment is reasonable in relation to the Company's financial results  position and development  as well as other factors. If significant changes take place within the Company  or on the market  which  by the assessment of the board of directors  would mean that the terms for allotment/transfer of Performance Shares according to LTIP 2024 is no longer reasonable  the board of directors shall have the right to amend LTIP 2024  including  among others  the right to reduce the number of allotted/transferred Performance Shares  or not to allot/transfer any Performance Shares at all.A.5: Implementation and administration etc.The board of directors shall  in accordance with the resolutions by the general meeting set forth herein  be responsible for the detailed design and implementation of LTIP 2024. The board of directors may also decide on the implementation of an alternative cash based incentive for participants in countries where the acquisition of Savings Shares or allotment of Performance Shares is not possible  as well as if otherwise considered appropriate. Such alternative incentive shall to the extent practically possible be designed to correspond to the terms of LTIP 2024. The intention is that the board of directors shall launch LTIP 2024 in May 2024.In the event that the general meeting does not resolve in accordance with item 14.b with the required majority  the Company shall hedge itself against the financial exposure that LTIP 2024 is expected to entail  by entering into a share swap agreement with a third party in accordance with what is stated in item 14.c below.14.b: Hedging measures regarding LTIP 2024 in the form of newly issued class C shares  including amendments to the articles of associationResolution in accordance with item 14.b is conditional upon that the annual general meeting resolves to amend the articles of association in accordance with item 12.B.1: Authorization for the board of directors to resolve on a directed issue of class C sharesThe board of directors proposes that the implementation of LTIP 2024 shall be made in a cost-effective and flexible manner  and that the undertakings of the Company for delivery of Performance Shares and the Company's cash-flow for the payment of social fees primarily shall be hedged by a directed issue of convertible and redeemable class C shares. These shares can be repurchased and converted into Ovzon Shares and transferred in accordance with the following.The board of directors shall be authorized to resolve on a directed issue of class C shares on the following terms and conditions:a) The maximum number of class C shares to be issued is 1 006 000.b) With derogation from the shareholders' preferential rights  the new class C shares may only be subscribed for by one external party after arrangement in advance with the board of directors.c) The amount to be paid for each new class C share (the subscription price) shall correspond to the share's quota value at the time of subscription.d) The authorization may be exercised on one or several occasions until the annual general meeting 2025.e) The new class C shares shall be subject to Chapter 4  Section 6 of the Swedish Companies Act (conversion clause) and Chapter 20  Section 31 of the Swedish Companies Act (redemption clause).f) The purpose of the authorization is to hedge the undertakings of the Company according to LTIP 2024 and  in terms of liquidity  to hedge payments of social security contributions related to Performance Shares.B.2: Authorization for the board of directors to repurchase issued class C sharesThe board of directors shall be authorized to repurchase class C shares on the following terms and conditions:a) Repurchase can only take place by way of an acquisition offer directed to all holders of class C shares in the Company.b) The maximum number of class C shares to be repurchased shall amount to 1 006 000.c) Repurchase shall be made at a cash price per share of minimum 100 and maximum 110 percent of the quota value applicable to the repurchased class C shares at the time of repurchase.d) The board of directors shall have the right to resolve on other terms and conditions for the repurchase.e) Repurchase may also be made of so-called interim shares regarding such class C shares  by Euroclear Sweden AB designated as a Paid Subscribed Share (Sw. Betald Tecknad Aktie  BTA).f) The authorization may be exercised on one or several occasions until the annual general meeting 2025.g) The purpose of the authorization is to hedge the undertakings of the Company according to LTIP 2024 and  in terms of liquidity  to hedge payments of social security contributions related to Performance Shares.B.3: Approval of transfer of Ovzon SharesApproval of transfer of Ovzon Shares owned by the Company on the following terms and conditions:a) A maximum number of 1 006 000 Ovzon Shares may - with derogation from the shareholders' preferential rights - be transferred to participants in LTIP 2024.b) It was noted that a proposal regarding an authorization for the board of directors to resolve on transfer of Ovzon Shares on Nasdaq Stockholm will be proposed by the board of directors prior to the annual general meeting 2027 in order to hedge the cash flow related to the Company's payments of social security contributions in relation to LTIP 2024.B.4: Reasons for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights etc.The reason for deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights is to implement the proposed LTIP 2024 as set out herein. In order to minimize costs for LTIP 2024  the subscription price shall equal the class C share's quota value.Since the board of directors considers that the most cost-effective method of transferring Ovzon Shares under LTIP 2024 is to transfer Ovzon Shares owned by the Company  the board of directors proposes that the transfer is hedged in this way in accordance with this item 14.b. Should the necessary majority not be obtained for the proposal in item 14.b  the board of directors will enter into a share swap agreement  in accordance with item 14.c below.B.5 Adjustment authorisation for the board of directorsThe board of directors  or a person appointed by the board of directors  shall be authorized to make minor adjustments to the above resolutions that may be necessary in connection with the registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and Euroclear Sweden AB  respectively.14.c: Hedging of LTIP 2024 via an equity swap agreement with a third partyIn the event that the necessary majority is not obtained for item 14.b above  the Company will hedge itself against the financial exposure that LTIP 2024 is expected to entail  by the Company entering into a share swap agreement with a third party  whereby the third party in its own name shall acquire and transfer Ovzon Shares in the Company regarding LTIP 2024. The relevant number of Ovzon Shares shall correspond to the number of shares proposed under item 14.b above.14.d: Other matters related to LTIP 2024D1. Estimated costs  expenses and financial effects of LTIP 2024The costs for LTIP 2024 which are charged in the profit and loss account  are calculated according to the accounting standard IFRS 2 and distributed over the vesting period. The calculation has been made based on the quoted closing price of shares in the Company as of 14 March 2024  i.e. SEK 13.98 per share  and the following assumptions: (i) dividend based on consensus estimates  (ii) an estimated annual turnover of personnel of 10 percent  (iii) an average fulfilment of the performance requirements linked to the Company's EPS of approximately 50 percent  (iv) an assumption of an annual share price increase of 10 percent  and (v) a total maximum of 1 006 000 Performance Shares are eligible for allotment. In addition to what is set forth above  the costs for the LTIP 2024 have been based on that the program comprises a maximum of 45 participants and that each participant makes a maximum investment.In total  the costs for LTIP 2024 according to IFRS 2 are estimated to approximately SEK 3.6 million excluding social security costs. The costs for social security charges are calculated to approximately SEK 1.1 million  based on the above assumptions  and also assuming a social security tax rate of 18.5 percent. The expected annual costs of SEK 1.6 million  including social security charges  correspond to approximately 1.8 percent of the Company's total employee costs for the financial year 2023.At a fulfilment of the performance conditions of 100 percent  the total cost for LTIP 2024 is estimated according to IFRS 2 to amount to approximately SEK 7.8 million excluding social security costs. The costs for social security charges are estimated to amount to approximately SEK 2.5 million based on an annual share price increase of 32.8 percent and also assuming a social security tax rate of 18.5 percent. The expected annual costs of SEK 3.4 million  including social security charges  correspond to approximately 3.9 percent of the Company's total employee costs for the financial year 2023.As proposed  LTIP 2024 may comprise a maximum of 1 006 000 shares in the Company  representing a dilution of approximately 1.06 percent of all shares and votes in the Company  including 186 214 shares that may be transferred on Nasdaq Stockholm to cover certain costs associated with LTIP 2024.The expected cost for the hedging arrangement through a directed issue of convertible and redeemable class C shares  and a repurchase and conversion of these shares to ordinary Ovzon-shares is approximately SEK 250 000 including registrations etc. The cost for a share swap arrangement with a third party is significantly higher and based on an interest base with an addition for the Company's lending costs  taking into account the structure of the share swap derivative.The effect on key ratios is only marginal.D.2: The board of directors' statementThe board of directors wishes to increase the ability of the Company and its subsidiaries to retain senior executives and other employees. Moreover  an individual long-term ownership commitment among the participants in LTIP 2024 is expected to stimulate greater interest and motivation in the Company's business operations  results and strategy. The board of directors believes that the implementation of LTIP 2024 will benefit the Company and its shareholders. LTIP 2024 will provide a competitive and motivation-improving incentive for senior executives and other employees within the Ovzon Group.LTIP 2024 has been designed to reward the participants for increased shareholder value by allotting Ovzon Shares  based on the fulfilment of result based conditions. Allotments shall also require a private investment by each respective participant through the acquisition of Savings Shares at market price. By linking the employees' remuneration to an improvement in the Company's results and value  the long-term value growth of the Company is rewarded. Based on these circumstances  the board of directors considers that the implementation of LTIP 2024 will have a positive effect on the Company's continued development  and will thus be beneficial to the shareholders and the Company.D.3: Preparation of the itemThe basis for LTIP 2024 has been prepared by the board of directors of the Company. The work has been supported by external advisors and has been made in consultation with shareholders. The board of directors has thereafter decided to present this proposal for the general meeting. Except for the staff that have prepared the matter upon instruction from the board of directors  no employee that may be a participant of the program has participated in the preparations of the program's terms.D.4: Other share-related incentive programsThe Company's other share-related incentive programs are described on page 80 (note 8) in the Company's annual report.Majority requirementsResolution in accordance with items 12 and 13 is valid only where supported by shareholders holding not less than two-thirds of both the shares voted and of the shares represented at the general meeting.Resolution in accordance with item 14.b is valid only where supported by shareholders holding not less than nine-tenths of both the shares voted and of the shares represented at the general meeting.Number of shares and votesThe total numbers of shares and votes in the Company on the date of this notice are 111 530 516.

The Tender Offers are subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions  as set forth in the Offer to Purchase; these conditions include the ""Financing Condition""  meaning the completion by any of the Companies of one or more offerings of new debt securities that close no later than the Expiration Time on terms satisfactory to the Companies (in their discretion)  including but not limited to the amount of net proceeds raised by such offerings being sufficient  in the aggregate  to effect the repurchase of the Notes validly tendered and accepted for purchase pursuant to the Tender Offers. The Companies will only accept for purchase Notes up to an aggregate purchase price (excluding accrued interest) that will not exceed the Offer Cap. To determine whether the Offer Cap has been reached  the Offerors will first convert the aggregate purchase price for the EUR Notes validly tendered into U.S. Dollars in the manner described in the Offer to Purchase. Subject to applicable law  the Companies reserve the right  but are under no obligation  to increase or decrease the Offer Cap in respect of the Tender Offers at any time (without extending the Withdrawal Deadline or otherwise reinstating withdrawal rights of Holders)  which could result in the Companies purchasing a greater aggregate principal amount of Notes in the Tender Offers. As more fully described in the Offer to Purchase  if the aggregate purchase price for the Notes validly tendered prior to the Early Tender Time exceeds the Offer Cap  subject to the Financing Condition the Offerors intend (but are not obligated to) to increase the Offer Cap by some or all of the amount of such excess  provided it will not be increased by more than $500 000 000 to a maximum amount of $2 500 000 000.

For the avoidance of doubt  Notes tendered prior to or at the Early Tender Time will have priority over Notes tendered after the Early Tender Time  regardless of the Acceptance Priority Levels.

The persons who will be involved in making such decisions  the states that will decide this  of course  they will become the objects of prosecution for many decades.”Some 70% of all Russian assets immobilised in the West are held in the central securities depository Euroclear in Belgium  which has the equivalent of 190 billion euros ($206 billion) worth of various Russian central bank securities and cash.When asked about Borrell’s plan  Maria Zakharova  spokeswoman for Russia’s foreign ministry  said: “It is simple banditry and theft.”Zakharova said that Russia would respond if the West went ahead with confiscating Russian assets.

The rest will be used for recovery and reconstruction.The exact amount available for Kyiv each year will depend on global interest rates as the profits are the returns on some 210 billion euros of Russian central bank assets held in various currencies in the 27-nation EU.On top of these profits  Ukraine will also receive every year the 25% tax that the Belgian government puts on the profits. For 2024  this is expected to amount to 1.7 billion euros  of which 1.5 billion euros will be paid this year.The total financial contribution for Ukraine from frozen Russian assets in the EU will therefore total 4.0-4.5 billion euros this year.Once the Commission proposal is approved by EU governments the profits are set aside for Ukraine twice a year  with a first tranche already in July.The Russian assets are held by EU central securities depositories  mainly Belgium’s Euroclear  which will keep 3% for operational expenses and temporarily retain 10% of the profits as a safeguard against legal action by Russia.The amount temporarily retained might be raised if needed  the Commission said. After the war  all the money  unless used to cover legal claims by Moscow  will be passed to Ukraine.European Commission Executive Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis said Russia was being held to account for the massive damage it had caused.“Our proposal will redirect substantial windfall revenues from frozen Russian state assets for the benefit of Ukraine and its people  to the tune of up to 3 billion euros a year ” he said.Dombrovskis said the EU had coordinated its move with the G7 countries – the United States  Canada  Britain and Japan.The EU proposal does not envisage  for now  the confiscation of the capital of the Russian assets  only the use of the profits they generate.Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said Kyiv expected the EU and G7 countries  which together hold the equivalent of some 260 billion euros of frozen Russian assets  to take a further step and to confiscate the capital itself.“We insist on the full confiscation or other use of all frozen assets… Europe and the world need an effective precedent for making the aggressor pay a heavy price for the destruction it has caused in Ukraine ” he told a news conference in Brussels.($1 = 0.9227 euros),neutral,0.14,0.82,0.04,negative,0.05,0.29,0.66,True,English,"['3 billion euros', 'Russia assets', 'Ukraine', 'profits', 'year', 'European Commission Executive Vice President Valdis Dombrovskis', 'Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal', 'European Peace Facility fund', 'EU central securities depositories', 'Russian central bank assets', 'The European Commission', 'global interest rates', 'total financial contribution', 'substantial windfall revenues', 'Russian state assets', '2.5 to 3 billion euros', '4.0-4.5 billion euros', 'Russian assets', 'Commission proposal', '210 billion euros', '1.7 billion euros', '1.5 billion euros', '260 billion euros', 'frozen assets', 'Jan Strupczewski', 'Ninety percent', 'various currencies', 'Belgian government', 'first tranche', 'operational expenses', 'legal action', 'legal claims', 'massive damage', 'G7 countries', 'United States', 'effective precedent', 'heavy price', 'news conference', 'Russia assets', '27-nation EU', 'EU governments', 'exact amount', 'full confiscation', 'other use', 'EU proposal', '0.9227 euros', 'Ukraine', 'profits', 'year', '3 minutes', 'BRUSSELS', 'Reuters', 'Wednesday', 'Moscow', 'weapons', 'recovery', 'reconstruction', 'Kyiv', 'returns', 'top', '25% tax', 'July', 'Belgium', 'Euroclear', 'safeguard', 'war', 'money', 'account', 'benefit', 'people', 'tune', 'move', 'Canada', 'Britain', 'Japan', 'capital', 'equivalent', 'step', 'world', 'aggressor', 'destruction']",2024-03-20,2024-03-20,swissinfo.ch

Nearly €200 billion of Russian assets were frozen there due to EU sanctions ...,"The European Union will continue to support beleaguered Ukraine  vowing to push ahead with a pledge for EU membership and promising more financial aid. The money could come from frozen Russian assets.One year ago  European Union member states pledged to deliver one million rounds of ammunition to support Ukraine's defense efforts against Russia. However  the EU has only been able to fulfill half of this military promise thus far.Nevertheless  significant financial and political assistance measures were unveiled in Brussels this Wednesday to aid the nation under attack by Russia.Ukraine to receive €50 billionThe first meeting of the so-called Association Council between the EU and Ukraine since the EU officially announced the commencement of accession negotiations with Ukraine in December was held in Brussels on Tuesday.The Association Council is tasked with preparing further steps leading up to formal accession negotiations Image: FRANCOIS LENOIR/European UnionUkrainian Prime Minister Denys Schmyhal presented a plan for reforms and reconstruction of Ukraine amid Russia's ongoing aggression. Ursula von der Leyen  the president of the European Commission  announced the disbursement of the first installment of €4.5 billion from the EU's new €50 billion ($54.3 billion) financing instrument for Ukraine  aimed at supporting the war-torn nation's budget until the end of 2027.""This is crucial for Ukraine "" von der Leyen told reporters in Brussels.Schmyhal said his government was ""very grateful for the support "" highlighting the importance of the €50 billion financing mechanism for stability. ""The EU is now truly on high alert because it knows that its vital interests are at stake.""EU High Representative Josep Borrell commended Ukraine's rapid progress towards EU approximation despite operating under wartime conditions. However  the European Commission  the EU's executive branch  has yet to determine the formal commencement of accession negotiations  which requires unanimous agreement from all 27 EU member states plus Ukraine.Hungary has repeatedly delayed Ukraine's accession process  and EU diplomats anticipate resistance or new demands from Budapest in the upcoming steps.EU set to use Russian assets for arms purchase for Ukraine To view this video please enable JavaScript  and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 videoRussian interest earnings to fund weapons for UkraineFollowing a February decision by EU heads of state and governments to seize profits from frozen Russian state assets in the EU for the benefit of Ukraine  the European Commission presented a plan on Wednesday detailing the utilization of profits from Euroclear-held Russian assets for Ukraine's benefit.This plan addresses approximately €3 billion in annual interest earnings generated from Russian state bank assets at the Belgian financial services provider Euroclear. Nearly €200 billion of Russian assets were frozen there due to EU sanctions  rendering them inaccessible for withdrawal or transfer by the Russian central bank.Russia's central bank has stored about €300 billion in assets abroad Image: Mikhail Tereshchenko/TASS/dpa/picture allianceWhile Ukraine had advocated for a complete confiscation of these funds  the EU opted to seize only the profits from Russian investments  citing legal concerns and the potential damage to international investor confidence in the eurozone. Following extensive deliberations  EU member states agreed to allocate the profits from Russian investments into a special budget known as the ""European Peace Facility.""Funds from this budget will finance arms deliveries to Ukraine  with €5 billion already contributed by EU member states.To address concerns from the European Central Bank (ECB) about potential financial instability for the private Belgian firm Euroclear and  consequently  the eurozone  Euroclear will retain a portion of the earnings from Russian assets as collateral to meet obligations to other investors and potential legal proceedings.The ECB fears that Chinese banks or other major investors may withdraw their assets from Euroclear  potentially necessitating a bailout by the Belgian government and triggering a financial crisis in the eurozone. Additionally  Russia could retaliate by seizing Euroclear assets  as approximately €33 billion of the Belgian financial services provider are reportedly held in Moscow.How the Kremlin reacted to the EU's planThe EU leaders are expected to discuss the plan to skim off Russian profits during a summit in Brussels on Thursday. Germany recently abandoned its original resistance to the model. Meanwhile  Belgium has announced that it will transfer the 25% capital taxes due on the Russian profits to Ukraine.With the possible use of Russian funds to finance Ukrainian arms sales  the EU is breaking new ground. So far  the confiscation of foreign assets of state banks has only occurred after the end of wars  such as after Iraq's first Gulf War against Kuwait in 1991 or after the end of World War II.In response to the plan to seize Russian profits  Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov denounced it  warning that it would undermine the West's reputation as a safe haven for investments.""The damage will be inevitable. The persons who will be involved in making such decisions  the states that will decide this  of course  they will become the objects of prosecution for many decades "" Peskov said in a statement. The Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman condemned the plan as ""banditry and theft.""Poland: Farmers angry at Ukraine To view this video please enable JavaScript  and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 videoFarmers' protests and tariffsOn Wednesday  EU member states also agreed to extend duty-free imports from Ukraine for another year. However  certain agricultural products  including honey  eggs  poultry  sugar  corn  and oats  may face tariffs again starting in June if imports exceed specific thresholds. The policy comes in response to farmers' protests  especially in Poland  who fear market distortions from cheap Ukrainian imports.Prime Minister Schmyhal expressed satisfaction with the decisions  noting that Ukraine could not reach or surpass the established caps on critical products  which are based on average values for 2022 and 2023.This article was originally written in German.",neutral,0.19,0.78,0.03,mixed,0.13,0.23,0.64,True,English,"['Russian asset plan', 'Ukraine aid', 'EU', 'DW', 'Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Schmyhal', 'EU High Representative Josep Borrell', 'Belgian financial services provider', 'Ursula von der Leyen', 'European Union member states', 'Russian state bank assets', 'FRANCOIS LENOIR/European Union', 'Ukrainian arms sales', 'private Belgian firm', 'one million rounds', 'political assistance measures', 'Mikhail Tereshchenko/TASS/dpa/picture alliance', 'international investor confidence', 'World War II', 'European Peace Facility', '€50 billion financing mechanism', 'potential financial instability', 'European Central Bank', 'annual interest earnings', 'first Gulf War', '27 EU member states', 'potential legal proceedings', 'Russian central bank', 'The European Union', 'other major investors', 'Russian interest earnings', 'Euroclear-held Russian assets', 'Russian state assets', 'formal accession negotiations', 'The Association Council', 'high alert', 'other investors', 'financial aid', 'significant financial', 'financial crisis', 'Belgian government', 'European Commission', 'potential damage', 'financing instrument', 'state banks', 'Russian investments', 'first meeting', 'first installment', 'arms purchase', 'arms deliveries', 'accession process', 'foreign assets', 'defense efforts', 'military promise', 'ongoing aggression', 'vital interests', 'rapid progress', 'wartime conditions', 'executive branch', 'formal commencement', 'unanimous agreement', 'web browser', 'February decision', 'legal concerns', 'extensive deliberations', 'Chinese banks', '25% capital taxes', 'possible use', 'EU membership', 'EU approximation', 'EU diplomats', 'EU heads', 'EU sanctions', 'EU leaders', 'Russian profits', 'Russian funds', 'new demands', 'new ground', 'war-torn nation', 'upcoming steps', 'HTML5 video', 'complete confiscation', 'The ECB', 'original resistance', 'Euroclear assets', 'special budget', 'beleaguered Ukraine', 'new €', 'pledge', 'money', 'ammunition', 'half', 'Brussels', 'attack', 'December', 'Tuesday', 'Image', 'plan', 'reforms', 'reconstruction', 'president', 'disbursement', 'end', 'reporters', 'support', 'importance', 'stake', 'Hungary', 'Budapest', 'JavaScript', 'weapons', 'governments', 'benefit', 'Wednesday', 'utilization', 'withdrawal', 'transfer', 'eurozone', 'portion', 'collateral', 'obligations', 'bailout', 'Moscow', 'Kremlin', 'summit', 'Thursday', 'Germany', 'model', 'Belgium', 'wars', 'Iraq', 'Kuwait', 'response']",2024-03-20,2024-03-20,dw.com

The first payment will be backdated to February 2024  when a new EU law was passed requiring Euroclear to segregate Russian assets.,neutral,0.15,0.76,0.09,negative,0.03,0.23,0.74,True,English,"['frozen Russian assets', 'Brussels', 'billions', 'Ukraine', 'Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal', 'extra central bank revenue', 'European Central Bank worries', 'first €4.5bn bridge financing', 'EU Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis', 'Russian central bank', 'global reserve currency', 'European Peace Facility', 'EU High Representative', 'EU member states', 'frozen Russian assets', 'new EU law', 'European Commission', '€5bn deal', 'international law', 'new proposal', 'Russian army', 'first step', 'first payments', '3 billion euros', 'longstanding promise', 'wider economic', 'political ramifications', 'illegal act', 'massive damage', 'seven democracies', 'small percentage', 'administrative costs', 'legal liability', 'battlefield conditions', 'Congressional squabbles', 'full confiscation', 'other use', 'effective precedent', 'heavy price', 'significant implications', 'Foreign Affairs', 'wider implications', 'EU leaders', 'first funds', 'Ukraine facility', 'vital funding', 'heightening concerns', 'Josep Borrell', 'Euroclear depositary', 'interest rates', 'unprecedented move', 'year', 'July', 'Belgium', 'war', 'officials', 'pressure', 'aggression', 'suffering', 'statement', 'partners', 'group', 'October', 'Brussels', 'tax', 'top', 'EPF', 'week', 'reporters', 'world', 'aggressor', 'destruction', 'reconstruction', 'today', 'plans', 'munitions', 'risk', 'bloc', 'Putin', 'borders', 'agreement', 'Council', 'notes', 'weapons', 'soldiers', 'credibility', 'place', 'February']",2024-03-20,2024-03-20,yahoo.com

The Kremlin said such plans – if implemented – would destroy Europe’s reputation as a reliable guardian of property rights and lead to years of litigation. “Europeans are well aware of the damage such decisions can do to their economy  their image  and their reputation as reliable  so to speak  guarantors of the inviolability of property ” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said. “The damage will be inevitable. The persons who will be involved in making such decisions  the states that will decide this  of course  they will become the objects of prosecution for many decades ” he added.

The purchase of any series of Notes is not conditioned upon the purchase of any other series of Notes. Any Notes validly tendered and not validly withdrawn in the Tender Offers and accepted for purchase will be purchased by the Companies based on the Offer Cap and the acceptance priority levels noted above (the ""Acceptance Priority Levels"")  each as more fully described in the Offer to Purchase. If the purchase of all validly tendered Notes would result in an aggregate purchase price greater than the Offer Cap  then the Tender Offers will be oversubscribed and if the Companies accept Notes in the Tender Offers  any Notes accepted for purchase in the lowest Acceptance Priority Level in which Notes are accepted for purchase will be accepted for tender on a prorated basis. For the avoidance of doubt  Notes tendered prior to or at the Early Tender Time will have priority over Notes tendered after the Early Tender Time  regardless of the Acceptance Priority Levels. If the Offer Cap is reached at the Early Tender Time  then no Notes tendered after the Early Tender Time will be purchased  unless the Companies increase the Offer Cap. ab-inbev.com Press release - 19 March 2024 - 3Holders of Notes that are validly tendered and not validly withdrawn at or prior to the Early Tender Time and that are accepted for purchase will receive the applicable ""Total Consideration""  which already includes the Early Tender Payment for the applicable series of Notes set forth in the table above. Holders of any Notes that are validly tendered after the Early Tender Time but at or before the Expiration Time and that are accepted for purchase will receive the applicable Total Consideration minus the Early Tender Payment. The Total Consideration minus the Early Tender Payment is referred to as the ""Tender Offer Consideration"". Holders are advised to check with any bank  securities broker or other intermediary through which they hold their Notes as to when such intermediary needs to receive instructions from a holder in order for that holder to be able to participate in the Tender Offers before the deadlines specified herein and in the Offer to Purchase. The deadlines set by the clearing system for the submission and withdrawal of tender instructions will also be earlier than the relevant deadlines specified herein and in the Offer to Purchase. Holders holding EUR Notes directly in the NBB-SSS or through a direct participant of the NBB-SSS (other than Euroclear or Clearstream  Luxembourg) must  in order to be eligible to participate in the EUR Tender Offers in the manner specified in the Offer to Purchase  (i) arrange for the EUR Notes which they wish to tender to be transferred to an account in either Euroclear or Clearstream  Luxembourg  and (ii) maintain  or where relevant  procure  access to an account in either Euroclear or Clearstream  Luxembourg through which such EUR Notes can be traded  and to which the Total Consideration or the Tender Offer Consideration (as applicable) and the applicable accrued interest payment may be credited by AB InBev. Holders of EUR Notes who do not have access to an account  as described above  in either Euroclear or Clearstream  Luxembourg (either directly or through a direct participant or other intermediary)  or who do not transfer the EUR Notes which they wish to tender to a direct participant in either clearing system  will not be able to submit a EUR Tender Instruction (as defined in the Offer to Purchase) to the Tender and Information Agent and will not be eligible to participate in the Tender Offers in the manner specified in the Offer to Purchase. Any Holder of EUR Notes who (i) holds its EUR Notes directly  or through a direct participant of the NBB-SSS  in an ""N account"" within the NBB-SSS  (ii) is not eligible  in accordance with Article 4 of the Belgian Royal Decree of 26 May 1994  to hold its Notes (directly or indirectly) in an ""X account"" within the NBB-SSS  and who is therefore unable to transfer the relevant Notes to an account in either Euroclear or Clearstream  Luxembourg and (iii) who is eligible to view the Offer to Purchase and make an investment decision with respect to the Tender Offers  may contact the Tender and Information Agent for further information  using the contact details set out below.

37737,Clearstream,Bing API,https://www.digitaltrends.com/home-theater/best-tv-antennas-for-rural-areas/,The 6 best TV antennas for rural areas in 2024,The best TV antennas for rural areas have a lot of range  can handle rough weather  and are able to get the most channels. Here are our top picks for you.,It’s not a secret  if you live in a rural area  you’re likely underserved by the most popular cable  internet  and live TV streaming services. TV antennas  however  will let you pick up signals from far away  with the result being consistent  free programming. And with the advent of ATSC 3.0  which brings in higher definition pictures and improved features to over-the-air broadcasting  now is as good a time as ever to get an antenna. So much so that our A/V section editor has  somewhat anachronistically  been telling us that you finally need to get an antenna in 2024.Yet still  the world belongs to urbanites. Admittedly  many of our picks for the best TV antennas are indoor only  or don’t have the power to get broadcast signal as far as you might need it from your rural home. Here  we’re taking a better look at those that do work best for rural areas and places otherwise underserved by the modern titans of entertainment. We’ll present a quick list of the best TV antennas for rural areas  followed by an in-depth look at why each one will serve your home well  and then finish off with insights into our reasoning for why we selected these TV antennas.The best TV antennas for rural areasBuy the for a powerful  long-range antenna with everything you need to use it.for a powerful  long-range antenna with everything you need to use it.

It includes a TV antenna that can be mounted to your roof with a simple bracket design  a 30-foot coaxial cable to transport what it receives to your home  and a splitter for up to three TVs to enjoy the entertainment at once. In other words  this is a good pick for everyone in the family to enjoy over-the-air programming  wherever they are in your home.The Antennas Direct ClearStream 4MAX weighs under three pounds and relatively easy to transport to your roof. It has a simple bolt-and-bracket mechanism for attaching to your roof  and all of the essentials — such as a 30-foot coaxial cable to port what it receives down into your home — are included in the packaging. As a result  we quite like this one. It doesn’t take an expert to get all of the appropriate and compatible wires and other equipment to make the experience great. You’ll also get extras  like an amplifier switch  which makes amplification (a sometimes-beneficial option for modern TV antennas) a snap. All-in-all  this kit is going to be on the expensive side  but that’s because it has everything and is rather powerful.Key Specifications Estimated range 70 miles Channel reception Hi-VHF  UHF Size 17.4 x 31.3 x 4 inches Weight 2.7 poundsAntennas Direct ClearStream 2MAXBest runner-upPros Cons Sturdy  quality build Not a full kit Decent reception range Simple bracket mountingAs a sort of “downgrade” to the Antennas Direct ClearStream 4Max  the 2Max variety is just fine for many people. It has a 60 mile effective range  only slightly lower than the previous  but a considerably lower profile and cost than the 4MAX version. The main reason for this is that it is not the full kit that you can get with the 4MAX  so if you know what you’re doing or are willing to shop around  you’ll be able to save quite a bit of money. Furthermore  skipping out on extras like the splitter might save you quite a bit of money on superfluous extras that your home doesn’t need.Otherwise  many of the features will be the same. The installation should be quite similar with a bracket-and-bolt design. There’s also a 20-foot mast (an upwards-facing pole) that comes with the kit for easy installation and to give you a bit of extra height. At a total of less than two pounds  anybody comfortable with ladders and climbing should be able to transport this to the roof. Finally  it is worth noting that this product has a lifetime manufacturer antenna warranty  so even though it doesn’t appear to be too tough  it should last you for the long term.Key Specifications Estimated range 60 miles Channel reception Hi-VHF  UHF Size 17.4 x 31.3 x 4 inches Weight 1.9 poundsPBD WA-2608Best yagi antennaPros Cons Includes remote rotation Rotation requires occasional readjustment Lightning protected Supports two TVS without splitter Includes 40-foot coaxial cableIf you can collectively decided on what to watch as a family  you may find that you’d like to “aim” at the broadcasting tower directly. While most TV antennas are capable of bi-directional reception gathering  getting most signal around you  a yagi aims in a uni-directional way. The PBD WA-2608 aims at whatever station you want  even when the stations you want are in multiple directions around you. For example  if the PBS station is to your North and the FOX station is to your South  you can press the red rotation button until the PBD WA-S608 points Northward to get PBS  then press and hold the button again until it points Southward to pick up FOX. You might find that you occasionally need to readjust your aim  but once you get used to it  the whole process should be relatively smooth.The PBD WA-2608 is lightning protected and comes with a 40-foot RG6 coaxial cable that is able to connect well with the antenna and receiver. You’ll appreciate its ability to support two TVs without additional splitting required. It’s easily bolted to the roof and can be placed on the side of the wall as well  but that configuration will reduce the efficacy of its 360-degree rotation  so we don’t recommend it.Key Specifications Estimated range 150 miles Channel reception VHF  UHF Size 17.5 x 13 x 14.5 inches Weight 6.4 poundsFive Star Yagi AntennaBest uni-directionalPros Cons Weather protections included Max range somewhat overstated Great uni-directional design No rotation button Includes 4-way splitterThe Five Star Yagi Antenna is probably the best TV antenna for you if you live in a rural area just outside of the city limits of a place with many broadcasting stations. It’s point-and-shoot yagi antenna design does not move easily or remotely  but once you have the proper aim lined up  you’ll be able to get a great reception for those key stations. There’s even a 4-way splitter included  so the whole family can enjoy great programming in separate rooms.Five Star states a range of 200 miles for their yagi antenna  which we assume is a somewhat theoretical range. In reality  the curvature of the Earth will likely prevent you from getting a full 200 miles except under very specific situations. This all being said  real customer reports and experiences with the Five Star Yagi Antenna from all over the glob are quite positive  including with the range. The only real negative for this design is  again  its lack of control in directionality. But  if you’re in the kind of situation where all of the main broadcast stations are generally coming from one area  this TV antenna is a great way for you to maximize your chances of getting great reception.Key Specifications Estimated range 200 miles Channel reception VHF  UHF Size 17 x 8 x 6 inches Weight 5.54 poundsAntop AT-800SBSBest for apartmentsPros Cons Multi-modal installation Large and bulky Includes VHF Enhancer Rods Also picks up FM radioWhile we expect most rural TV antenna users to be living in a home or other dwelling with rooftop access  we also know that isn’t always the case. The Antop AT-800SBS is the best TV antenna for rural areas if you’re not a homeowner. It has so many great ways that it can be mounted. While rooftop  side-of-the-wall  and even indoor options are available  there is a choice that we think you’ll really appreciate — balcony mounting.The Antop AT-800SBS has vertical and horizontal “mast bars” that can quite easily be affixed to the bars of your balcony’s perimeter. While this will naturally limit your reception capabilities to the generalized direction that the TV antenna is facing  it is certainly better than nothing and not a fault of the antenna itself. You can alternatively attempt to place it outside of or even inside of a window  but before you place anything outside of your unit (even on the exterior of your balcony wall) be sure to contact your property manager or  at the very least  check your lease. Note  also  that the Antop AT-800SBS is somewhat heavier and bulkier than you might first expect  so be sure to check out the dimensions before you get creative.A final word while we’re discussing the capabilities of the Antop AT-800SBS  it can handle FM radio  too! This means that if you’re getting a TV antenna for emergency preparedness  you can use it to get both television news and those all-critical FM news broadcasts. Just makes sure you have a portable power station and enough shielding to have the device weather through whatever storm you’re facing.Key Specifications Estimated range 85 miles Channel reception VHF  UHF  FM radio Size 23.79 x 11.2 x 6.82 inches Weight 8.28GE Outdoor UltraProBest budgetPros Cons Very low cost Somewhat difficult installation Surprisingly durable Lifetime warrantyIf you want to go all in on the free entertainment aspect of TV antennas  check out GE’s Outdoor UltraPro antenna  which can be mounted outside or in your attic (as shown on the box). It has a large body with a durable construction  though it is at least partially made of plastic. That being said  GE gives it a lifetime warranty  so we expect the long-term durability and usage to be quite high. A bit of wind won’t rip it apart.The surprising low point for the GE Outdoor UltraPro is not range  which rocks out at 70 miles  but rather the difficulty in its assembly. While paper instructions are included  the paper they’re on is tiny  and hard to read. Taking your glasses up on the roof  flipping through the pages  and then having a quick burst of wind sending the manual a mile down the road could be a nightmare. Either take pictures of the pages on a low-cost tablet and take that up with you  or do as much pre-assembly as you can before ascending your ladder.Key Specifications Estimated range 70 miles Channel reception VHF  UHF Size 29 x 15 x 20.5 inches Weight 3 poundsHow we chose these TV antennas for rural areasWhat matters to you  as a person living in a rural area  when you buy a TV antenna? Obviously  individuality matters  and it is no way fair to make large-scale assumptions about your wants or needs. However  there are some consistent features of the environment and infrastructure that are worth considering when making a selection of TV antenna. All of our selections for the best TV antennas for rural areas  above  were made with most or all of the following assumptions in mind.You have fewer nearby broadcasting stationsThe vast majority of broadcast centers are going to be centered near cities. They have resources for employees  a vast customer base  and the opportunity to make the most money. And  even should there be a broadcast station near you  there is probably only one or perhaps two. You can check your home out for yourself via the FCC’s DTV Reception Map database  though to get a better picture of what’s going on in your location.On the website  you can click each station to see where it is located relative to your position  including how many miles away it is and a direction (useful for when you want to point your antenna directly towards it for the best possible reception). It is also useful to pay attention to the band listed  where you’ll see UHF  Lo-V  and/or Hi-V. These refer to the UHF and UHV bands that your antenna will advertise being able to find.Taking these factors into consideration  we looked for TV antennas that have at least 40 miles of estimated range  but more was always considered better for rural customers. Additionally  antennas that supported both UHF and UHV were most preferred. Your local circumstances will let you know if you can get by with one or the other band. Any ability to rotate the antenna remotely was considered positive. Note that we have mixed feelings about amplification  which — as the word implies — amplifies signal. It does not refine said signal. So  if a signal is fuzzy  the amplified version could very well be fuzzier.You have roof accessHome ownership (or rental) tend to be quite high in the US at large  and the census reports that homeownership rates are highest in rural America. As such  there is a broad assumption that you have access to a roof  trailer-top  or even van top. As such  we’re looking at outdoor antennas. If you’re an apartment dweller in a rural community  you can try an indoor antenna  but you also might be out of luck. Discuss your entertainment situation with your property manager before proceeding.While we’re on the topic of the roof and being outdoors  it is worthy to mention that we understand the diverse environments of rural areas. The tree coverage and branch proximity to your rooftop — which can present challenges to both reception-getting and the health and integrity of your antenna — are going to be largely different in the rural areas 40 miles from Topeka  Kansas and those 40 miles from Knoxville  Tennessee. Likewise  weather and wind will differ in these areas. At the same time  winds can be stronger and the likelihood of being hit by a branch in a storm are naturally larger in these areas.Taking these factors into consideration  we looked for outdoor antennas that have high durability and varying profiles of size. A decently long warranty with good coverage was also worth looking into. Any factors that gave the antenna weather protection were considered highly positive.You plan on a DIY installationChances are  if you live in a rural area  you are at least considering doing the antenna installation yourself or with a local crew of your buddies. While we know this isn’t going to be the case for everyone  it is still worth considering what makes an installation easy. Lower weights and compact  foldable form factors certainly help. Be sure to check our favorite coaxial cables for TV antennas while you’re at it to ensure a smooth installation process.This article is managed and created separately from the Digital Trends Editorial team.Editors' Recommendations,positive,0.62,0.37,0.01,mixed,0.71,0.21,0.08,True,English,"['6 best TV antennas', 'rural areas', 'full kit Decent reception range Simple bracket mounting', 'live TV streaming services', 'lifetime manufacturer antenna warranty', '60 mile effective range', 'Antennas Direct ClearStream 4Max', '70 miles Channel reception', 'simple bracket design', 'higher definition pictures', 'A/V section editor', 'remote rotation Rotation', '30-foot coaxial cable', '40-foot coaxial cable', 'consistent, free programming', 'Best complete kit', 'powerful, long-range antenna', 'less powerful alternative', 'best TV antennas', 'modern TV antennas', 'great unidirectional antenna', 'ClearStream 4MAX Kit', 'quality TV antenna', 'Pros Cons Sturdy', 'Best yagi antenna', 'Weight 2.7 pounds Antennas', 'simple bolt', 'bracket mechanism', 'Best runner-up', 'ClearStream 2MAX', 'Weight 1.9 pounds', 'expensive kit', 'popular cable', 'coax cable', 'The Antennas', 'modern titans', 'air programming', 'quality build', 'bolt design', 'great control', 'multi-use antenna', 'cheap antenna', 'great performance', '4MAX version', 'three pounds', 'two pounds', 'rural area', 'air broadcasting', 'broadcast signal', 'quick list', 'many areas', 'amplifier switch', 'three TVs', 'other words', 'compatible wires', 'other equipment', 'beneficial option', 'Key Specifications', 'UHF Size', '2Max variety', 'many people', 'lower profile', 'main reason', '20-foot mast', 'facing pole', 'extra height', 'long term', 'occasional readjustment', 'two TVS', 'good durability', 'good pick', 'depth look', 'other essentials', 'easy installation', 'expensive side', 'superfluous extras', '3-way splitter', 'rural home', 'secret', 'internet', 'signals', 'result', 'advent', 'ATSC', 'features', 'world', 'urbanites', 'picks', 'places', 'entertainment', 'one', 'insights', 'reasoning', 'everything', 'wall', 'balcony', 'roof', 'family', 'packaging', 'expert', 'appropriate', 'experience', 'amplification', '4 inches', 'sort', 'downgrade', 'previous', 'cost', 'bit', 'total', 'ladders', 'climbing', 'product', 'PBD', 'Lightning']",2024-03-20,2024-03-20,digitaltrends.com

Quadient has already started rolling out its carrier-agnostic parcel lockers  with an initial target of installing 400 locker units across Stonegate’s 1 200 managed properties.“We believe pubs sit at the heart of British culture and support any move that can turn them into even more of an asset to the local community ” said Claire Rust  Senior Buying Manager  Stonegate Group. “Parcel Pending by Quadient smart lockers enable people living near our pubs to easily and securely pick up and return online deliveries from a convenient  trusted location. From Plymouth to Glasgow  introducing parcel lockers to our sites is already benefitting customers and the local community.”Already used by DHL  DPD UK  Evri and UPS  Quadient’s Open Locker Network allows pub customers and local residents to pick up and return items at any time. The lockers’ built-in ability to print shipping labels simplifies the returns process  and their secure construction keeps valuable items safe from package theft  which a recent Quadient Police FOI request revealed rose more than 500% in four years.Katia Bourgeais-Crémel  EVP Parcel Locker Solutions Europe at Quadient  said: “Our vision with the Quadient Open Locker Network is to allow consumers to access lockers anywhere and ideally combine pick-up with other trips as part of everyday life. As established community assets  Stonegate’s pubs make natural host locations. Our research found most consumers recognize that lockers benefit their community  making the environment safer by reducing delivery van traffic and opportunities for theft. We are looking forward to further expanding our network with Stonegate Group and giving people even more places to conveniently pick up and return parcels.”Quadient is establishing strategic partnerships across the UK to secure premium locations for its Open Locker Network  including at forecourts and parking sites.

MyTasks provides benefits to both drivers and fleet managers. Drivers do not need to fumble with a mobile phone  reducing distractions  and managers do not need aftermarket accessories  enhancing efficiency and safety.The application is an innovative patented interface between manager and driver  leveraging over-the-air capability and updates. Through an over-the-air update  MyTasks will also be available on existing Stellantis vehicles in the field today equipped with compatible communication technology and infotainment units.MyTasks enables fleet managers or dispatchers to assign tasks or change schedules of individual drivers via an online portal. Vehicle drivers then get an instant notification of assignments via a pop-up message in the vehicle’s infotainment screen. The connected system allows drivers to send their assigned destination to the vehicle’s navigation system for routing and provides dispatchers the status of each task.“A breakthrough tool like MyTasks is the result of when we put our customers’ needs above all else ” Stellantis Chief Software Officer Yves Bonnefont said. “We know that our B2B customers value efficiency and safety for their drivers and their fleets and we are using the capabilities built into our vehicles to cut down on the potential distractions and deliver key information to make their job easier.”Free2move will add this to its commercial offer  completing the already existing business solutions such as Preventive Maintenance and Connect Fleet . The service can also be made available via API integration to all B2B partners that already have a tool to plan daily fleet activities. Pro One  the Stellantis Commercial Vehicles Business Unit  will be the first to offer this technology. MyTasks will be available in the first half of this year in Europe on compact and mid-size vans from the Citroën  FIAT Professional  Opel  Peugeot and Vauxhall brands. Availability will expand by the end of this year to large vans and compatible passenger cars in Europe and commercial vehicles in North America.Deploying advanced technology that enhances vehicle safety and keeps drivers informed is a key element of Stellantis’ commitment in the Dare Forward 2030 strategic plan to offer cutting-edge mobility.

This multicenter  prospective  open-label  interventional study enrolled 115 patients and has co-primary efficacy endpoints of the Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) responder rate  per the Sher criteria  and the Oxygen Desaturation Index (ODI) responder rate  both measured at 12 months*. Subjects also were required to sleep supine for at least 60 minutes at their 12-month polysomnography test (PSG). More information regarding the study can be found in section 1.5.4 of the Company's annual report regarding financial year 2022  which can be found on the Company’s website using the following link: Nyxoah Annual Report 2022 EN.pdf.Study participants entered the DREAM study with a mean AHI of 28.0  mean ODI of 27.0 and mean body mass index of 28.5. At 12 months  73 subjects were determined to be AHI responders  per the Sher criteria  resulting in an ITT AHI responder rate of 63.5% (p=0.002)  and 82 subjects were determined to be ODI responders  resulting in an ODI responder rate of 71.3% (p<0.001). Subjects demonstrated a median 12-month AHI reduction of 70.8%  with similar AHI improvements in supine and non-supine sleeping positions. The safety results for the investigational treatment were favorable  with 11 serious adverse events  or SAEs  in ten subjects resulting in an SAE rate of 8.7%.

Additional information can be found in the two press releases of 12 March. The company welcomes the support of all shareholders in this financial operation.This rights issuance is the culmination of several months of financial restructuring that has resulted in the following measures designed to solidify and stabilize the financial position of the company:An exit from the equity-line product with Yorkville.The negotiation and payment of all legacy payables.Raising working capital for the next 12 months.Tonner Drones is pleased that it was able to successfully launch the rights issuance with the firm support of its main shareholder and guarantors. Their support ensures that the company reaches its financial target of €5 million.To date  Tonner Drones has received positive feedback from shareholders regarding their participation in the rights issuance given that they have priority in participating during the Subscription Window and then sharing in the company’s relaunch.With this significant financial restructuring complete  and the Subscription Window open  Tonner Drones can begin to shift its focus to the following strategic initiatives:The development  production and sales of Countbot  a promising robotic inventory management system dedicated to the vibrant logistics sector.Continued cost reductions in line with the company’s objectives of a monthly burn rate of only € 50 000 (as compared to € 200 000 under former management)  so as to maximize the company’s ability to operate profitably.The continued sales of the legacy parts  accessories  and inventory left behind by former management  so as to generate cashflow which can be used to extend the cash runaway and develop products.Increased dedication to the French private drone companies  Donecle and Elistair  in which the company holds minority positions. Both companies have a strong shareholder base and have experienced steady growth in recent years. Last year  Donecle raised capital at a € 10 million valuation and further growth is expected for both companies  particularly with Tonner Drones’ involvement.Increasing the company’s focus on implementing its strategy of adding the military and defense markets to its offerings. In addition to its strategic partnership with Techaviacom in Ukraine  Tonner Drones continues to actively meet with potential partners to help it develop  produce  and sell its military drone and associated patents.Becoming a drone industry aggregator  bringing under one umbrella the fragmented drone industry comprised of numerous smaller drone companies working on only a particular piece of an overall drone solution for the marketplace. Tonner Drones’ managerial expertise and financial backing will allow it to seamlessly integrate these isolated companies along all lines and create shareholder value.With a current share price of over € 0.20  shareholders can buy shares at a 90% discount when they use their preferential subscription right (“PSR”) to subscribe to new shares. As a reminder  for every 1 share they own  current shareholders can buy 120 new shares at a price of € 0.025.New investors can also buy PSR (FR001400ONI6) in the market to allow them to subscribe to the new shares. All investors can subscribe under ‘titre libre’ to buy shares at € 0.025 but those orders will only be executed in the event that not all PSR are used to subscribe to the rights issuance.Please note that the PSR will have their last day of trading at the close of trading on 25 March. The Subscription Window  however  for those shareholders with PSR  will remain open until the close of trading on 27 March. Shareholders and investors are advised to speak their respective banks or other advisors regarding precise deadlines  as some financial institutions may have more restrictive deadlines.In the press release of 12 March  a remaining debt of around € 6.25 million was communicated. This figure needs to be corrected because the participation of Ott Heritage was not taken into account when calculating it. Ott Heritage has committed to participating in the rights issuance for a minimum of € 1 million to maintain its 20% stake. As such  the remaining debt is only € 5.25 million. All debt has a long maturity.As a final note  € 2.1 million of this outstanding € 5.25 million in debt is owed to legacy financing party Fiducie A  which is capped at 13.5% of the daily volume and has a monthly fixed conversion price to limit its influence on the stock market price.All information can be found in the press release of March 12th https://tonnerdrones.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/CP_Lancement_AK_DPS_TonnerDrones_FR_Final.pdf.There is also a FAQ available:https://tonnerdrones.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/FAQ_DPS_SiteWeb_TonnerDrones.pdfAbout Tonner Drones : Tonner Drones (formerly Delta Drone) develops UAVs and associated technologies for the defense and homeland security sectors.

This progress was driven by the integration on January 1  2023 of the Swiss company OK Job.The Multi-servicesdivision (19.9% of activity for the period) achieves a turnover of € 504.1 million (2)  an increase of 14.6% (+14.9% at constant scope and exchange rates).Airport activities  which concentrate 76.5% of the division's activity  total a turnover of € 385.8 million (2)  an increase of 14.9% compared to the 2022 financial year.

Its trading name is ""Virbac"". The company was established in 1968 in Carros.After the joint ordinary and extraordinary shareholders' meeting held on June 17  2014  which adopted the resolution on reviewing the by-laws  the company's lifetime was extended to 99 years  i.e. until June 17  2113.The head office is located at 1ère avenue 2065m LID  06516 Carros. The company is registered in the Grasse Trade and companies register under the number 417350311 RCS Grasse (France).Our consolidated accounts for the 2023 financial year were approved by the board of directors on March 15  2024. They will be submitted for approval to the shareholders' general meeting on June 21  2024  which has the power to have the statements amended.The explanatory notes below form part of the consolidated accounts.Significant events over the periodCyberattackVirbac was the subject of a cyberattack on the night of June 19 to 20  2023  on several of its sites around the world. Exceptional measures were immediately taken as soon as we became aware of this attack  and a crisis unit  including experts dedicated to cyber security  was set up in order to assess the impacts on our systems and quickly organize the corrective measures necessary to ensure business continuity.This attack resulted in a slowdown or temporary interruption of some of our services  which was contained thanks to the responsiveness and mobilization of our teams. We have been able to rely on our systems and data (not corrupted) till June 19  and on reinforced measures of internal control implemented from June 20  on.Corrective action continued throughout the summer  and as of the month of August  we have been operating almost normally across all our operations again. We have also recovered all IT data and applications while further strengthening our IT infrastructures.Although the impact of the cyberattack on the financial year results is limited  it resulted in additional costs and the major impacts have been related to the vaccine production in Carros.InflationCost increases continued in 2023  as expected and to a lesser extent compared to 2022. However  their impacts have been limited by price increases in some of our products  as well as the negotiation over several years of certain supply contracts.Vaccines2023 has been impacted by temporary limitations in the production capacity of dog and cat vaccines  which were more significant than expected.This has weighed on our absorption of fixed costs as well as on our sales  given the low level of our vaccine inventories.Acquisition of GS Partners on May 2  2023On May 2  2023  we completed the acquisition of 100% of the shares of GS Partners  our long-standing distributor in the Czech Republic and Slovakia and also one of our oldest distributors in Central Europe.This acquisition  which represents several years of successful partnership between our teams and GS Partners  fully aligns with our external growth strategy.

CALLED FOR APRIL 29  2024 Point 3 on the Agenda 3. Appointment of the Board of Directors; Establishment of the number of members of the Board of Directors; Establishment of the duration of the mandate of the Board of Directors; Appointment of Board of Directors members; Appointment of the Chairperson of the Board of Directors; Determination of Board of Directors members' remuneration. 1Dear Shareholders  the approval of the financial statements for the year ended December 31  2023  concludes the term of office of the Board of Directors of your company (the ""Company"" or ""SECO"")  appointed by the Shareholders' Meeting on March 1  2021  based on the provisions of the ByLaws in effect on the date of the appointment and therefore prior to the trading commencement date (the ""Trading Commencement Date"") on the regulated market Euronext Milan  STAR segment (""Euronext STAR Milan"")  organized and managed by Borsa Italiana S.p.A. (""Borsa Italiana"")  without the application of slate voting. Therefore  it is necessary to appoint the new Board  determining the number of members and the term of office. In this regard  please note the following in particular. Composition and establishment of the duration of the mandate of the Board of Directors In this regard  it should be recalled that  pursuant to Article 15 of the By-Laws in force  the Board of Directors of your Company may consist of no fewer than 5 (five) and no more than 11 (eleven) Directors. The Shareholders' Meeting shall determine the number of members of the Board of Directors from time to time and before appointment  within the above limits. The Directors  who must meet the requirements of eligibility  professionalism and honorability provided for by law  including regulations pro tempore in force applicable to the Company  are appointed for a period of 3 (three) fiscal years  or for the period  however not exceeding 3 (three) fiscal years  established by the Shareholders' Meeting at the time of appointment  and are eligible for re-election. The Directors remain in office until the date of the Shareholders' Meeting called to approve the financial statements for their final year of office  subject to the conditions of discontinuation and lapse established by law and the By-Laws. Pursuant to Article 15.2 of SECO's By-Laws  a minimum number of Directors not less than that established by the pro tempore regulations in force  must meet the independence requirements prescribed by the provisions  including regulatory provisions  applicable from time to time (the ""Independence Requirements"") and thus meet the independence requirements established by Article 148  paragraph 3  of Legislative Decree No. 58/1988  as subsequently amended and supplemented (the ""CFA"") and Article 2  Recommendation 7 of the Corporate Governance Code approved by the Corporate Governance Committee (the ""Corporate Governance Code"")1. In this regard  please note that your Company's shares are admitted to trading on the Euronext STAR Milan and that SECO is therefore subject to the provisions for issuers holding STAR status prescribed by the Regulations of the markets organized and managed by Borsa Italiana (the ""Stock Exchange Regulation"") and related instructions (the ""Stock Exchange Instruction Regulations""). Specifically  according to Article IA.2.10.6 of the Stock Exchange Instruction Regulation  Boards of Directors consisting of up to eight members must contain at least two Independent Directors and Boards of Directors consisting of nine to 14 members must contain at least three Independent Directors. See Article 2.2.3  paragraph 3  letter m) of the Regulations of the markets organized and managed by Borsa Italiana S.p.A. applicable to issuers holding STAR status. 2In this regard we also note that the Board of Directors  with the support of the Appointments and Remuneration Committee  has defined the quantitative and qualitative criteria for assessing the significance of relationships (including financial ones) that could compromise the independence of its members  as specified in the ""Policy for the identification of qualitative and quantitative criteria for assessing the significance of situations that may compromise the independence of Directors provided for in Article 2  Recommendation No. 7 (c) and (d) of the Corporate Governance Code"" adopted by the Board of Directors on March 11  2024 and published on SECO's website (www.seco.com/it). Directors leave office in the cases provided by law. The lapse of a Director's Independence Requirements does not cause his or her disqualification if the requirements continue to be met by a minimum number of Directors who  according to the applicable regulation pro tempore  must possess such Independence Requirements. The composition of the Board of Directors must also comply with the gender balance regulations set forth in Article 147-ter  paragraph 1-ter of the CFA and by the other provisions in force  taking into account that - as provided for by Law No. 160 of December 27  2019 (Article 1  paragraph 304) - in the event of renewal after the trading commencement date on a regulated market  the criterion that ensures at least one-fifth of the elected Directors are of the under-represented gender shall apply. Therefore  since this is the first renewal of the Board following the Trading Commencement Date  at least one-fifth of the Directors elected must belong to the under-represented gender2. Mechanism to appoint the Board of Directors on the basis of slate voting Pursuant to Article 16 of the By-Laws  the appointment of the Board of Directors will take place using slates submitted in the manner set forth below  in which the candidates must be listed sequentially and in compliance with the pro tempore regulations in force regarding Directors meeting the Independence Requirements and Gender Balance. Each shareholder  shareholders who are members of a shareholder agreement pursuant to Article 122 of the CFA  the parent company  the subsidiaries and those subject to joint control and any other party with which there is a connection  even indirectly  pursuant to the applicable law and regulations  may not submit or take part in the submission of more than one slate or vote for different slates  either directly or through a nominee or trust company. The votes in breach of this are not attributed to any slate. Each candidate may run on one slate only  on penalty of ineligibility. Candidates who (notwithstanding any other reason for ineligibility) do not hold the requirements established by law or the By-Laws  or other provisions concerning their respective offices  may not be included on the slate of candidates. We also note that Shareholders presenting a ""Minority Slate"" should comply with the recommendations of Consob under Communication No. DEM/9017893 of February 26  2009. We note that the composition of the Board of Directors in office at the date of this Report already complies with the rules on gender balance (in accordance with the provisions for newly listed companies). However  since this application took place on a voluntary basis  in accordance with the provisions of Consob Communication DIE No. 0061499 of 18.07.2013  the latter will not be taken into account for the purposes of calculating the six consecutive terms provided as the period of application of the rules on gender balance. 3Slates may be submitted by the current Board of Directors and shareholders who  alone or together with others  at the time of submitting the slate  collectively hold shares representing at least the minimum percentage of the share capital with voting rights at the Shareholders' Meeting established by Consob pursuant to the Issuers' Regulation issued by Consob in Resolution No. 11971 of 1999  as subsequently amended and supplemented. In this regard  it should be noted that by Executive Resolution No. 92 of the Head of the Corporate Governance Division dated January 31  2024  Consob set the shareholding required for the submission of slates for the election of the Company's Board at 2.5%. Slates must be received by the Company in one of the following ways: delivery by certified electronic mail to seco.corporate@pec . by Thursday  April 4  2024  together with a copy of a valid identity document of the those presenting the slate  or. by Thursday  April 4  2024  together with a copy of a valid identity document of the those presenting the slate  or delivery to the Company's registered office in Arezzo  Via Achille Grandi  No. 20  to the kinf attention of the Lawyer Alessandro Guido  on working days  by 6:00 pm  on Thursday  April 4  2024. The slates shall be accompanied by: (i) information concerning the identity of the shareholders submitting the slates  with an indication of the total percentage of the shareholding with voting rights at the Shareholders' Meeting; (ii) a statement by shareholders other than those who hold  including jointly  a controlling interest or a relative majority  certifying the absence of any connection  even indirect  with the latter  pursuant to applicable law and regulations; (iii) exhaustive information on the personal and professional characteristics of the candidates  with an indication of their eligibility for the role of Independent Director  in addition to a declaration by those candidates certifying that they are in possession of the requisites provided for by the law and other applicable regulations and by these By-Laws  including those of good standing  professionalism  and - where required - independence  and their acceptance of the nomination and of the position  if elected; (iv) any other or differing statement  information and/or document provided for by the applicable law or regulations. Ownership of the shareholding required to submit the slate shall be attested by the intermediary authorized to maintain accounts sending to the Company the notice provided for in Article 43 of Consob and Bank of Italy's consolidated regulation on post-trading of August 13  2018 (""Regulations on central counterparties  central depositories and centralized management activities"") including after the slate has been filed  provided that it is at least twenty-one days before the date set for the Shareholders' Meeting on single call  i.e.  by April 8  2024. The ownership of the holding is established considering the shares which have been registered in favor of the shareholders on the day on which the slates are filed with the Company. Each slate that presents a number of candidates equal to or greater than three must also include candidates belonging to both genders  so that the under-represented gender makes up at least the proportion of Board of Directors members established by the pro 4tempore regulations in force relating to gender balance and thus ensure  as mentioned above  that the under-represented gender obtains at least one-fifth of the Directors  rounded up to the highest unit. Slates presented in violation of the above rule are considered void. However  lack of documentation relating to individual candidates on a slate does not imply the automatic exclusion of the entire slate  but only of those candidates who do not meet the requirements. The slates shall also be subject to the other means of publication in accordance with legislation and regulations in force. In particular  at least twenty-one days before the date of the Shareholders' Meeting (i.e.  April 8  2024) the slates are made available to the public at the registered office  on the Company's website (www.seco.com) and by the other means established by Consob. Those with voting rights may vote on only one slate. Appointment of the Board of Directors The Board of Directors shall be elected as illustrated below. From the slate that obtains the majority of the votes (the ""Majority Slate"")  in the progressive order on the slate  all the Directors are elected  except: one (1) Director  in the event that only one Minority Slate is submitted  or more than one Minority Slate is submitted but no Minority Slate is validly supported by a number of shares representing at least 5% of the capital entitled to vote at the Shareholders' Meeting. This Director will be drawn from the slate - which has not been presented by the Board of Directors and which is not connected in any way  even indirectly  with those who submitted or voted for the Majority Slate - that obtained at the Shareholders' Meeting the highest number of votes after the Majority Slate  in the person of the first candidate  according to the sequential order in which the candidates are indicated on the slate; or two (2) Directors  in the event that more than one Minority Slate is submitted and at least one is validly voted for by a number of shares representing at least 5% of the capital entitled to vote at the Shareholders' Meeting. One director will be drawn from each of the first two Minority Slates - excluding any slates presented by the Board of Directors or that are connected in any way  even indirectly  with those who submitted or voted for the Majority Slate - that have obtained the highest number of votes after the Majority Slate  according to the sequential order in which the candidates are indicated on the slates. In relation to that above  consideration is not taken of the slates which have not obtained at least half of the votes required for the presentation of the slates. In case of parity between slates: (i) if a slate is submitted by the Board of Directors  a fresh round of balloting shall take place; (ii) otherwise  the slate submitted by the Shareholders holding the largest equity investment or  alternatively  by the largest number of shareholders  shall prevail. If  at the end of the vote  not enough Directors with the Independence Requirements are 5elected  the candidate who does not comply with these requirements and who was elected last in numerical order from the slate that obtained the highest number of votes shall be excluded and shall be replaced by the first unelected candidate in numerical order on the same slate who complies with said Independence Requirements. If necessary  this procedure will be repeated until the number of Directors meeting the Independence Requirements is reached. If  following this replacement procedure  the composition of the Board of Directors makes it impossible to comply with the minimum number of Directors meeting the Independence Requirements  the replacement shall be carried out by means of a motion passed by the Shareholders' Meeting by majority of the votes therein  subject to the presentation of candidates who meet the Independence Requirements. If  following the voting the elected candidates do not ensure compliance of the composition of the Board of Directors with the rules on gender balance pursuant to Article 147-ter  paragraph 1-ter of the CFA  the candidate of the over-represented gender elected last in numerical order on the slate which obtained the highest number of votes shall be excluded and replaced by the first unelected candidate of the under-represented gender from the same slate  according to the numerical order. This replacement procedure shall continue until the composition of the Board of Directors complies with the pro tempore rules on gender balance  it being understood that if - upon completion of this replacement procedure - the composition of the Board of Directors still does not comply with said rules  the replacement shall be made by means of a motion passed by the Shareholders' Meeting with a majority of the votes represented therein  subject to the submission of candidates belonging to the under-represented gender. If the number of candidates elected on the basis of the slates submitted is lower than the number of Directors to be elected  the remaining Directors are elected by the Shareholders' Meeting  which resolves with the majority of the votes represented therein and  in any case  in such a way as to ensure (i) the presence of the minimum number of Directors who meet the Independence Requirements  and (ii) gender balance. In the event of a tie between several candidates  a further ballot shall take place and the candidate who obtains the highest number of votes shall be elected. If only one slate is submitted  the Shareholders' Meeting shall vote on it and  if that slate obtains the majority of votes cast  all members of the Board of Directors shall be taken from this slate  in compliance with the provisions of the By-Laws regarding Directors meeting the independence requirements and gender balance. If no slate is submitted or if only one slate is submitted and it does not obtain a majority of the votes represented at the Shareholders' Meeting  or if the entire Board of Directors is not to be renewed  or if it is not possible for any reason to appoint the Board of Directors through the slate voting procedure governed by Article 16.8 of the By-Laws  the members of the Board of Directors shall be appointed by the Shareholders' Meeting in the ordinary manner and by a majority of the votes represented therein  without application of the slate voting mechanism  and in any case in such a way as to ensure compliance with the provisions of the By-Laws regarding Directors meeting the Independence Requirements and gender 6balance  and without prejudice to the provisions of Articles 16.9 and 16.10 of the By-Laws regarding the replacement of Directors and termination of the Board of Directors. Appointment of the Chairperson of the Board of Directors The Shareholders' Meeting is also called to resolve on the appointment of the Chairperson of the Board of Directors  pursuant to Article 17.1 of SECO's By-Laws. For information on the shareholder guidance issued by SECO's outgoing Board of Directors on the qualitative and quantitative composition deemed optimal  please refer to the following section on Board of Directors guidance. Orientations of the Board of Directors At its meeting held on March 11  2024  and upon the proposal of the Appointments and Remuneration Committee which met on March 17  2024 - and taking into account the results of the self-assessment required by the Corporate Governance Code  and considering the well-established corporate governance rules according to which the number of members of the Board must be appropriate to the size and complexity of the Company's organizational structure - your Company's Board of Directors determined a guideline that considers a number of Directors equal to nine to be appropriate  consistent with the provisions of SECO's By-Laws. It was also suggested that a Board consisting of fewer than the 11 Directors of which it currently consists of might be more suitable considering the challenges to come in the next three years. In any case  the Board of Directors underlines that it has operated excellently with its current size of 11 Directors. The Board also recommends adequate assessment of the members who meet the independence requirements set forth in Article 148  paragraph 3  of the CFA and the Corporate Governance Code; in this regard  as described above  please note that pursuant to Article IA.2.10.6 of the Stock Exchange Instruction Regulation  Boards of Directors composed of up to eight members must contain at least two Independent Directors and Boards of Directors composed of nine to 14 members must contain at least three Independent Directors. The Board also notes that at least one-fifth of the Directors must belong to the under- represented gender (rounded up to the nearest unit) in accordance with current gender balance legislation. In addition  with regard to diversity policies (Article 123-bis  letter d-bis  CFA)  the Board recommends that the new composition  in continuity with the past  adequately represents  in relation to the Company's business  the different components (executive  non-executive  independent) and the professional and managerial skills and experience necessary for good corporate governance. Specifically  also in order to promote understanding of the Company's organization and its activities  in addition to the development of an efficient governance therein  the Board deems it appropriate that  without prejudice to the legal requirement of gender balance: (a) the Board features age diversity among its members; the educational and professional background of the Directors ensures a balanced combination of profiles and experiences suitable to ensure the proper performance of the 7functions assigned to it. The Board also considers it necessary for each candidate  in accordance with the recommendations of the Corporate Governance Code  to ensure adequate time availability for the diligent fulfillment of the duties assigned to them. The Board of Directors did not deem it necessary to define general criteria regarding the maximum number of Directorships and Statutory Auditor positions in other companies that may be considered compatible with effective performance as a Director of SECO. This is without prejudice to the duty of each Director to assess the compatibility of Directorships and Statutory Auditor positions held in other listed or large companies that may be considered compatible with effective performance as a Director of the Company  taking into account the commitment resulting from the role held  as indicated in Recommendation 15 of the Corporate Governance Code. Determination of Board of Directors members' remuneration We note that the Shareholders' Meeting is asked to determine the remuneration of the members of the Board of Directors. In this regard  it should be noted that pursuant to Article 22 of the By-Laws  Directors are entitled to reimbursement of expenses incurred in the performance of their duties and remuneration determined by the Shareholders' Meeting  it being understood that  pursuant to Article 2389  paragraph 3  of the Civil Code  the Shareholders' Meeting may determine an overall amount for the remuneration of all Directors  including those holding special offices  to be divided by the Board of Directors. The remuneration of Directors holding specific offices is determined by the Board of Directors  after hearing the opinion of the Board of Statutory Auditors. For more information  please refer to the Company's Remuneration Policy. * * * We invite: Shareholders submitting their own slate of candidates for appointment to the Board of Directors to ensure that these slates are accompanied by all the information necessary to enable shareholders to cast their votes in an informed manner  including an indication of whether the candidates qualify as independent;Shareholders submitting a slate containing more than half of the members to be elected to formulate - and to send to the certified e-mail address seco.corporate@pec.it - proposals for the appointment of the Board of Directors (determination of the number of members  duration of the Board of Directors  candidate for the office of the Chairperson of the Board of Directors  in addition to remuneration)  well in advance so that such proposals can be published by the Company at the same time as the slates.e-mail address - proposals for the appointment of the Board of Directors (determination of the number of members  duration of the Board of Directors  candidate for the office of the Chairperson of the Board of Directors  in addition to remuneration)  well in advance so that such proposals can be published by the Company at the same time as the slates.

In the wake of the first half-year  marked by the implementation of actions and investments aimed at aligning the Group and its model ahead of the launch of the SHIFT5 strategic plan  this annual decline ties in mainly with:the year-on-year rise in personnel costs (17.9m  an increase of +17%) due to the impact of companies that joined the Group in recent months  particularly internationally (MB CAD  Braithwaite  Daxium  Absiskey)  and to changes in the sales force incentive model  now based on bookings;the rise in external purchases and expenses (€3.7m  an increase of +8%)  due to marketing investments to standardise brands as part of international expansion (UK  Germany  Benelux  Switzerland)  and to increased investment in the CSR policy and the All Visiativ employee experience program.The Group's EBITDA margin came in at 9.8%  compared with 11.0% one year prior. Given the seasonal nature of Visiativ's business  the EBITDA margin was 12.1% in H2 2023 (reminder: 6.8% in H1 2023)  compared with 12.9% in the H2 2022.In France  Visiativ recorded an EBITDA margin of 9.7% versus 9.9% in 2022  due to changes in the sales force incentive model.Internationally  profitability represented 9.9% of the EBITDA margin versus 12.8% in 2022  taking into account marketing investments made to standardise brands.NET INCOME OF €10.0MAfter taking into account net depreciation and amortisation  operating income came to €17.5m  giving an operating margin of 6.3% compared with 7.3% one year earlier.Net financial expense amounted to €5.1m  compared with €3.2m in 2022  due to the increase in debt resulting from acquisitions and higher interest rates. To guard against a rise in interest rates  a hedging contract was signed in early 2023  covering the interest on 50% of the variable-rate debt.Visiativ booked net proceeds of €3.1m corresponding to the partnership signed with XEFI for the transfer of its 100% stake in Visiativ Managed Services  an IT infrastructure and hosting manager  to XEFI's NEXEREN datacenter subsidiary.Finally  net profit (Group share) came to €10.0m in 2023  compared with €11.1m the previous year.At its meeting on 15 March 2024  in view of the proposed acquisition by Groupe SNEF  the Board of Directors decided to propose to shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on 21 May 2024 that no dividend be paid.€54.6M IN AVAILABLE CASH AT END-2023Cash flow at end-2022 amounted to +€24.8m  vs. +€27.2m one year prior.Despite the high level of activity in Q4  the change in the working capital requirement was contained (-€4.3m)  enabling Visiativ to post a solid operating cash flow of +€20.5m in 2023 (vs +€24.5m in 2022).

We note that by a resolution passed on April 27  2023  the Company's Shareholders' Meeting authorized the purchase and disposal of ordinary shares.

As of the date of this Report that authorization has not been executed  even partially. At the Reporting Date  the Company holds 0 treasury shares  equal to 0 % of the share capital. In view of the approaching expiry of the eighteen-month period for the authorization to purchase resolved by the aforementioned Ordinary Shareholders' Meeting on April 27  2023  and also taking into account the continuing validity of the reasons underlying this authorization  it is proposed to the Shareholders' Meeting to renew the authorization to purchase treasury shares  for the purposes  terms and conditions indicated below  for a further period of 18 months  and to grant a new authorization to dispose of treasury shares without time limits  subject to revocation of the resolution passed on April 27  2023. 1. Reasons for the requested authorization to purchase and dispose of treasury shares The request for authorization to purchase and dispose of treasury shares covered by the proposed authorization is targeted at providing the Company with a useful strategic investment opportunity  also taking into account the purposes permitted by current provisions - including the purposes contemplated in Article 5 of Regulation (EU) 596/2014 (Market Abuse Regulation  hereinafter the ""MAR"") and in the practices permitted pursuant to Article 13 MAR where applicable including  purely by means of non-exhaustive example  to serve share option programs or other allocations of shares to employees or members of the administrative or control bodies and for the purposes of the possible use of the shares as consideration in corporate transactions  including the exchange of shareholdings with other parties  as part of transactions in the interest of the Company  all in any case within the 2terms and according to the procedures that may be decided by the competent bodies of the Company. 2. Maximum number  category and nominal value of the shares to which the authorization refers At the Reporting Date  the share capital of the Company amounts to Euro 1.296.944 48   divided into a total of 132.976.117 shares  with no par value  of which (i) 132.972.617 ordinary shares traded on Euronext STAR Milan  (ii) 2 500 Management' 20 Shares; and (iii) 1 000 Management Performance Shares. At the same date  SECO holds 0 treasury shares  equal to 0 % of the share capital  whereas the Issuer's subsidiaries do not hold any SECO shares The authorization is requested for the purchase  including in several tranches  of SECO shares up to a maximum number that  taking into account the number of ordinary shares of the Company held in the portfolio at a given time  does not exceed the maximum limit set by the applicable pro tempore regulations (as at the Reporting Date  this limit is set at one fifth of the share capital pursuant to Article 2357  paragraph 3 of the Civil Code).

It should be noted that the impact on revenue growth resulting from the integration of GS Partners (acquisition of our distributor in the Czech Republic closed in May) and Globion (acquisition in India closed in November)  representing only 0.3 points of growth  is considered non-material and therefore consolidation scope was not restated3current operating income  before depreciation of assets arising from acquisitions  reflects current income adjusted for the impact of allowances for depreciation of intangible assets resulting from acquisition transactions4net cash corresponds to current (€47.7 million) and non-current (€40.7 million) financial liabilities as well as a lease obligation related to the application of IFRS 16 (€35.1 million)  less the cash position and cash equivalents (€175.9 million) as published in the statement of financial position5operating cash flow corresponds to operating income (€184.0 million) restated for items having no impact on the cash position and impacts related to disposals. The following items are adjusted: fixed asset depreciation and impairments (€46.7 million)  provisions for risks and charges (€1.6 million)  provisions related to employee benefits (-€0.6 million)  and other expenses and income without any impact on the cash position (€1.4 million)  and impacts related to disposals (+€2.0 million)6non-material impact of restatement linked to IAS 12 amendment relating to deferred tax assets and liabilities - see full note in the half-year financial reportThe accounts were audited by the statutory auditors and examined by the board of directors on March 15  2023. The report of the statutory auditors is in the process of being issued. The statements and detailed presentation of annual income are available on the corporate site at corporate.virbac.com.Thanks to the exceptional commitment of our teams around the world  we achieved annual revenue of €1 246.9 million  compared with €1 216.2 million  representing an overall change of +2.5% compared with the same period in 2022  and a +4.9% growth at constant exchange rates. The impact on revenue growth resulting from the integration of GS Partners (acquisition of our distributor in the Czech Republic closed in May) and Globion (acquisition in India closed in November) is only 0.3 points. Excluding these two acquisitions  growth at constant rates would have been +4.6%. Against a backdrop of normalizing market growth  this performance demonstrates the resilience of our business model  which was significantly challenged by two intrinsic and unfavorable one-off effects during the year. As a reminder  these were a temporary limitation of our production capacities for companion animal vaccines  and a cyber attack on June 19 which forced us to shut down plants for several weeks. In terms of geography  Europe (+5.8% at constant rates) and Asia/Pacific (+4.0% at constant rates) remain the main areas driving our organic growth momentum over the year. Growth in Europe was mainly driven by France (+6.9% at constant rates)  Northern Europe and Southern Europe (respectively +4.0% and +4.9% at constant rates)  as well as by Turkey  where business volume more than doubled compared with 2022. In Asia/Pacific  the main contributors were India (+6.1% at constant rates)  followed by Australia and New Zealand (respectively +4.9% and +6.7% at constant rates)  offsetting the drop observed in China (-10.8% at constant rates)  while business in Southeast Asia remained stable. In Latin America (+4.9% at constant rates)  we observed very good growth dynamics in all our subsidiaries (with double digit growth in Mexico and Brazil)  with the exception of Chile which  despite a significant rebound in the second half (+20% at constant exchange rates)  posted a drop for the full year due to a sharp decline in the first half (-32% at constant exchange rates)  especially in antibiotics. Our revenue in the United States rose by +3.5% at constant rates  despite a year-long distributors’ destocking effect.Current operating income before depreciation of assets arising from acquisitions amounted to €188.1 million  up compared to 2022 (€186.6 million). Boosted by an estimated ~+5% price effect coupled with a more favorable product mix  our organic growth led to an increase of gross margin in absolute value. Our operating expenses increased in line with our sales growth. This increase is visible in personnel costs  due to the impact of salary increases and the strengthening of organizations. The significant increase in R&D expenditures reflects our commitment to accelerate investments in this crucial area. Our operating margin continues to improve: at the end of December 2023 and at constant exchange rates  before R&D and amortization of assets arising from acquisitions  our current operating profit ratio to revenue is up by 0.4 points to reach a record level of 23.2%.Consolidated net income was €121.1 million  stable compared with the same period in 2022. Net financial expenses increased by €6.7 million due to the depreciation of certain currencies as well as  to a lesser extent  a rising cost of net financial debt. Conversely  the tax charge decreased in absolute terms  reflecting a base effect (2022 had recorded non-recurring tax provisions) as well as a favorable country-mix effect in 2023.Net income - Group share amounted to €121.3 million in 2023  stable compared with the previous year (€121.9 million).On the financial front  our net cash position stood at €52.4 million at the end of December 2023  compared to €79.4 million at the end of December 2022. This decrease of our net cash position over the year is mainly due to an increase in our capital expenditure  with  among others  the closing of two acquisitions (GS Partners and Globion) for around €55 million7  as well as the impact of the share buyback program for around €20 million.OutlookIn 2024  at constant exchange rates and scope  we expect a ratio of “current operating income before depreciation of assets resulting from acquisitions” (Ebit adjusted) to “revenue” around 15% with growth in revenue estimated at this stage to be between 4% and 6%. As announced in our previous communications  this level of profitability takes into account a deliberate further acceleration in our R&D investments  representing nearly +0.5 points as a percentage of revenue compared with 2023. We reaffirm our ambition to achieve an Ebit adjusted ratio of 20% by 2030: in this respect  we plan over the next few years to gradually restore our R&D investments to the Group's normative and historical level  with a ratio of R&D investments to revenue around 2.0 percentage points below 2024 level.In addition  excluding any acquisitions  our cash position is expected to improve by €30 million  given the expected investments over the period  estimated to be around €100 million and considering the acceleration of our efforts in R&D.Finally  at the next shareholders' general meeting  a net dividend per share of €1.32 will be recommended for distribution for the 2023 fiscal year.7includes net cash of acquired companiesANALYSTS’ PRESENTATION – VIRBACWe will hold an analysts meeting on Wednesday  March 20  2024 at 2:30 p.m. (Paris time - CET) in the Édouard VII Business Center’s auditorium  23 square Edouard VII 75009 Paris (France).Participants may arrive 15 minutes before the start of the meeting.You may also attend the meeting using the webcast ( audio + slides ) available via the link below.Information for participants :Webcast access link: https://bit.ly/42gMcGlThis access link is available on the corporate.virbac.com site  under the heading “Public releases.” This link allows participants to access the live and/or archived version of the webcast.You will be able to ask questions via chat (text) directly during the webcast or after watching the replay via the following email address: finances@virbac.com.A lifelong commitment to animal healthAt Virbac  we provide innovative solutions to veterinarians  farmers and animal owners in more than 100 countries around the world.

Cabka N.V. (together with its subsidiaries “Cabka”  or the “Company”)  a company specialized in transforming hard to recycle plastic waste into innovative Reusable Transport Packaging (RTP)  listed at Euronext Amsterdam  announces its preliminary non-audited 2023 full year results.Cabka CEO Tim Litjens  commented:“In 2023 we’ve made solid progress with the execution of our strategy. Investments in product innovation have led to the launch of various new Reusable Transport Packaging (RTP) products based on recycled plastics  particularly in the strategic segments of large foldable containers and customized solutions. We launched these new products based on longer-term commercial partnerships with leading industry players such as Continental  BMW  CHEP  IFCO  and Red Bull. These partnerships form the foundation for future growth and further margin enhancement.In our operations we completed the consolidation and expansion of our ECO business in Europe  leading to immediate sales growth  reopened and expanded our production plant in the US  and completed the divestment of our PVC business.2023 is characterized by challenging general market circumstances with increasing interest rates leading to significant destocking and restricted capital investments from customers in most of Cabka’s end markets. This was especially notable in the US  where key customers deliberately chose to restrict their CAPEX spending. It resulted in overall lower market demand and pricing pressure across the industry especially in the second half of the year. Going into 2024 we expect to see a recovery by Q2.In the context of these challenging market circumstances  Cabka posted full year sales in 2023 of €197 million  6% lower compared to the record sales achieved in 2022 of €209 million. The decline in sales was driven by the divestment of the PVC business  and declining sales in the non-strategic contract manufacturing segment. The continued focus on product innovations enabled Cabka to mitigate market headwinds and deliver stable sales across its strategic segments  while the reopening of our operations in the US allows us to recover the market share lost due to the flooding.Although sales declined  our operational EBITDA has increased by 8% from €22.5 million in 2022 to €24.2 million in 2023  representing an improvement of our operational EBITDA over Sales from 10.8% to 12.3%. Contributing factors are the continued recovery of our gross margins due to lower variable costs  and a gradual shift towards higher value-add products. On top strict cost discipline resulted in a limited increase of fixed costs against a background of high inflation.Despite slow sales at the start of the year  the current recovery of order intake and pipeline of new product launches underpins our expectations of delivering mid-single digit sales growth for the full year  and an EBITDA margin within the 13-15% range.”Financial HighlightsTotal sales for the full year of 2023 amounted to €197 million  6% lower compared to the record sales achieved in 2022 of €209 million. Sales in strategic segments remained stable at € 187 million. Decline driven by a € 11 million lower sales in the divested PVC business and non-strategic Contract Manufacturing.Consolidation of Cabka’s strong European position in RTP Portfolio  sales up 2%.Customized Solutions growth of 20%  driven by new product launches in Europe and sales to Target in the US.ECO sales growth of 8%  following the completion of its capacity expansion in Q1 2023Operational gross profit at € 99.8 million (2022: € 92.6 million)  bringing the gross margin to 51% (2022: 44%).Operational EBITDA increased to € 24.2 million (2022: € 22.5 million)  reflecting a margin improvement of 1.5pp to 12.3% (2022: 10.8%).Net Income from operations improved 50% to € 2.5 million (2022: € 1.6 million).Net IFRS Income improved to € -0.7 million (2022: € -29.8 million  mainly as a result of non-cash listing expenses).Net Working Capital at € 27.1 million or 13.7% of sales (2022: € 38.3 million  respectively 18.3%)  leading to a strong improvement in cash flow from operations to € 27.1 million (€ 5.3 million).Net debt € 56.8 million including lease obligations (2022: € 44.6 million) Total CAPEX of € 30.9 million (2022: €24.6 million)  including maintenance & replacement investments of € 7.4 million  3.8% of sales.An agreement was reached with a consortium of banks on a new initial debt facility of € 80 million for four years at improved terms.Dividend: the company proposes a cash distribution of € 0.15 per Ordinary Share  subject to AGM approval.Strategic & Market HighlightsNew co-development products launched with our customers include: the CabFold hybrid for BMW  the CabFold Prime for CHEP  the Red Bull BigBag pallet  the IFCO Hybrid pallet  the Xella Nestable pallet and the Continental tire pallet.A two-year framework agreement with Tesla was signed  coming into effect in 2024Recycled raw material inflow at 89% (2022: 86%) of total compared to a European recycling average 1 of 14%of 14% Cabka North America’s plant in St. Louis (MO) fully up and running since July 2023 after 2022 flooding.Consolidation and expansion of our ECO business completed in Q1 2023.Divestment of non-strategic PVC business completed in Q4 2023.Condensed bridge from operational to IFRS consolidated statement of profit and loss  2023 preliminary unaudited 2in € million20232022ChangeRevenues 196.9 208.9 -6% Other operating income items 3.4 11.9 -72% Total Operating Income 200.3 220.8 -9% Expenses for materials  energy and purchased services (100.5) (128.2) -22% Gross Profit 99.8 92.6 8%Operating expenses (75.6) (70.0) 8% Operational EBITDA 24.2 22.5 7% Depreciation  amortization and impairment of intangible and tangible fixed assets (16.9) (18.0) -6% EBIT /Operating Income 7.3 4.5 60% Financial results (4.0) (2.4) 69% Earnings before taxes 3.3 2.2 51% Taxes (0.8) (0.5) 52% Net income from operations 2.5 1.6 50% Non-operational items IPO listing expenses3 - (26.8) IPO other related costs (1.1) (3.2) ECO restructuring - (0.6) St. Louis Flooding4 (3.2) (6.9) Tax on non-operational items 1.0 6.0 Non-controlling interest -0.1 Net result reported IFRS (0.7) (29.7)DistributionProposed cash distribution of € 0.15 per ordinary share  subject to AGM approval.Medium-term guidance updateIn light of the inflationary pressure impacting industries across the board  Cabka reviewed its medium-term guidance for the period 2021-2026. Cabka reiterates its guidance on high single digit sales growth  maintenance and replacement CAPEX (~4%)  Net Working Capital at approximately 20% of sales and pay-out ratio of net profit (~30-35%). Given the continued and increasing impact of inflation on margins we now expect to grow EBITDA margin towards 17% by 2026.OutlookAfter a slow start of 2024  full year mid-single digit sales growth expected  and EBITDA margin within the 13-15% range.COMPREHENSIVE OVERVIEW 2023Sales performanceSales in 2023 are to be considered in the context of challenging general market circumstances  with increasing interest rates leading to significant destocking and restricted capital investments from customers in most of Cabka’s end markets. This resulted in overall lower market demand and pricing pressure across the industry.In 2023  Cabka realized € 196.9 million in sales  6% lower compared to the record sales of€ 208.9 million in 2022. Lower total sales were driven by the divestment of the PVC business  and declining sales in the non-strategic contract manufacturing segment. The continued focus on product innovations enabled Cabka to mitigate market headwinds  resulting in stable sales across strategic segments.Aligned with our strategy  Cabka continued its focus on product innovations throughout 2023. Sales from Customized Solutions demonstrated strong growth in 2023 increasing with 20.3% to € 53.0 million (2022: € 44.0 million). The increase was predominately driven by new products launched in close partnership with CHEP  Continental  and BMW and sales to Target in the US.Given challenging market circumstances  with rising interest rates and the destocking effect noted in the end markets of Cabka  our RTP portfolio business was robust  increasing with 1.9% to €68.1 million in 2023 (2022: €66.8 million).The consolidation and expansion of our ECO business was concluded by the end of the first quarter in 2023. This strategic decision already proved positive results  delivering 7.6% sales growth in 2023 to realize a total revenue of €24.5 million (2022: €22.8 million).Cost developmentsRaw material costs prices and the energy prices reduced significantly in 2023  after the steep increases in 2022. We noted stabilizing prices in the second half of 2023  also resulting from our stringent energy hedging policy. Together with an active diversification of our energy sources  it significantly helped to control our variable costs.The reopening of the US plant in the second half of 2023 allowed us to avoid further expensive tolling costs. With our own in-house production and recycling lines back on track we expect our margins to further strengthen. Consequently  our operational gross margin improved to 50.7% (2022: 44.3%)Operating expenses increased 8%  predominantly driven by the impact of inflation on personnel costs  but also on all other operating expenses  such as insourced services  insurances  audit fees and repairs & maintenance costs. Also  certain key vacancies in sales were successfully filled.Depreciation and amortization decreased by 6.3% to € 16.9 million  due to lower depreciation of fixed assets in the US whilst production was not yet operational.EBITDAIn 2023  Cabka achieved an operational EBITDA of € 24.2 million  which is a 7.5% increase compared to 2022 of € 22.5 million  representing 1.5 pp improvement in operational EBITDA over Sales from 10.8% to 12.3%. Operational EBITDA improved as a result of lower variable costs leading to continued recovery in gross margin  a gradual shift towards higher value-add products and strict cost control limiting the impact of high inflation on fixed costs.Debt Facility RenewalIn December 2023  Cabka reached an agreement with a consortium of banks on a new initial debt facility of € 80 million for four years  which includes extension options for up to two years. The new initial facility is agreed at improved terms and conditions for Cabka. It consists of two parts: namely a € 30 million term facility and € 50 million revolving credit facility  replacing the € 27 million outstanding debt facility and the € 30 million initial revolving credit facility. The facility will be used to enhance Cabka’s growth and innovation capabilities and organizational flexibility.Net Working CapitalNet Working Capital position was € 27.1 million or 13.7% of sales as per 31 December 2023 which is well within our medium-term guidance. Compared to the 31 December position of € 38.3 million  the net working capital position decreased by 29.3%.The movement in Net Working Capital for the year was € 11.2 million5. The positive movement in Net Working Capital is the result of a € 9.7 million decrease in inventory  followed by a decrease in trade receivables and other current assets of € 4.2 million. This was partially offset by a decrease in trade payables and other current liabilities of € 2.7 million.The decline in inventory value was the result of active inventory management  stabilizing raw material and energy costs  and delivery of moulds to our customers in 2023 versus 2022. Active reduction of our raw materials inventory led to a decrease in trade payables. Diligent management of trade receivables resulted in a healthy position by year end.Cash flows and cash positionCash flows from operating activities amounted to € 27.1 million (2022: € 5.3 million). This comprised of an inflow of € 20.7 million from operating activities (2022: € 15.9 million) and € 6.4 million positive movement in our working capital (2022: € -10.7 million)  resulting from active working capital management.Cash flows used in investing activities amounted to € 30.0 million (2022: € 23.1 million) of which € 30.4 million was related to capital investments in tangible assets (2022: € 24.2 million) and € 0.5 million in intangible assets (2022: € 0.4 million). Cabka disposed of certain assets contributing € 0.7 million of cash  in addition  interest earned on short term deposits amounted to € 0.2 million.Cash flows used in financing activities amounted to € -11.1 million (2022: € 29.7 million  of which € 41.7 million cash flow from IPO proceeds). Main cash out flow resulted from the repayment of debt facilities and interest totaling € -7.2 million (2022: € -6.8 million)  followed by the settlement of lease facilities in 2023 amounting to € -2.7 million (2022: € -5.1 million).The total cash balance at 31 December 2023 was € 7.3 million (31 December 2022: € 21.0 million).CAPEXTotal CAPEX for 2023 came at € 30.9 million (2022: € 24.6 million).

The Group has continued to achieve record turnover thanks to the steady organic growth that has led some events to achieve their best performance ever  as well as the recovery of post-pandemic volumes  which had continued to penalize Q1 2022 with the postponement of certain events  reducing exhibition and visitor volumes. Adjusted EBITDA amounted to 49.5 million euros  an improvement of 31.5 million euros  compared to 31 December 2022 when the Group recorded gross operating margins of 18.1 million euros  but also an increase compared to 2019  the last pre-pandemic year  which was a record year for the Group in terms of sales and margins. The EBITDA margin came to 23.3% recovering 12.1 percentage points compared to 31 December 2022  thanks to higher volumes and price effect  despite inflation pressure which continues to impact supplies  particularly those related to services  transport and materials. The group closed the year with a profit of 13.3 million  up 14.2 million euros compared to the previous year  when it made a loss of 0.8 million euros. The Net Financial Position as of 31 December 2023 amounted to 71.9 million euros  an improvement of 23.4 million euros compared to the previous year when it was 95.4 million euros thanks to steady operating cash generation.

The main driver of the incremental change in turnover was the organic component which was 21.8 million euros (+25.1%)  while the so-called ""Restart"" effect of the events was 10.4 million euros  marking an increase of 12.0% compared to the previous period. The Hosted Events recorded total revenues of 4.5 million euros  with an organic increase compared to 2022 (3.1 million euros as of 31 September 2022) of 1.4 million euros.

Revenue in 2023 attributable to the Related Services segment amounted to 62.7 million euros (52.0 million euros as of 31 December 2022)  up 10.7 million euros compared to the previous year  driven by 10.2 million euros of organic growth  while the post-pandemic 'Restart' effect contributed about 1.4 million euros to the revenue growth for the period. Publishing  Sports Events and Other Activities  through the publishing activities carried out for tourism sector (TTG Italia  Turismo d'Italia e HotelMag) and for the gold sector (VO+ e Trendvision)  the sports events and other residual revenues  have developed total revenues for 3.9 million euros  substantially in line with the result achieved as of 31 December 2022. Operating Costs as of 31 December 2023 amounted to 121.6 million euros (106.5 million euros as of 31 December 2022)  with the percentage of turnover decreasing from 66.4% to 57.3%  as a result of higher volumes  mainly due to organic growth and partly to the so-called 'Restart' effect.

The Adjusted EBITDA Margin at 31 December 2023 stood at 23.3% of revenue  compared to 11.3% at the end of 2022. The margin recovery of about 12.1 percentage points was driven in particular by increased volumes and partially by price effects  as well as by the recovery of post- pandemic volumes ('Restart' effect). The Group's Adjusted EBIT as of 31 December 2023 stood at 31.6 million euros  an improvement of 29.4 million euros compared to the previous year  with a percentage profitability of 14.9% compared to 2.2 million euros in 2022. Financial Operations as of 31 December 2023 amounted to -5.0 million euros (as of 31 December 2022 it was positive for 0.5 million euros)  with an increase in financial expenses of 1.5 million euros  mainly due to the increase in interest rates for bank loans  as well as the negative effects of the change in the fair value of derivative financial instruments for 3.7 million euros. 3Earning Before Taxes as of 31 December 2023 was 20.7 million euros  an improvement of 20.3 million euros compared to 31 December 2022.

The incremental change of 5.6 million Euros in Tangible Assets mainly relates to investments made by Group companies  while the utilisation of deferred tax assets of 3.3 million Euros recognised on tax losses carried forward and the adjustment of financial assets for a total of 4.1 million Euros had a decreasing effect. The negative Net Working Capital of 67.3 million Euros as of 31 December 2023  decreased by 10.1 million Euros in connection with the higher non-current liabilities recorded against advances from customers for events to be held in the first quarter of 2024 due to higher volumes.

Cabka N.V. (together with its subsidiaries “Cabka”  or the “Company”)  a company specialized in transforming hard to recycle plastic waste into innovative Reusable Transport Packaging (RTP)  listed at Euronext Amsterdam  announces its preliminary non-audited 2023 full year results.Cabka CEO Tim Litjens  commented:“In 2023 we’ve made solid progress with the execution of our strategy. Investments in product innovation have led to the launch of various new Reusable Transport Packaging (RTP) products based on recycled plastics  particularly in the strategic segments of large foldable containers and customized solutions. We launched these new products based on longer-term commercial partnerships with leading industry players such as Continental  BMW  CHEP  IFCO  and Red Bull. These partnerships form the foundation for future growth and further margin enhancement.In our operations we completed the consolidation and expansion of our ECO business in Europe  leading to immediate sales growth  reopened and expanded our production plant in the US  and completed the divestment of our PVC business.2023 is characterized by challenging general market circumstances with increasing interest rates leading to significant destocking and restricted capital investments from customers in most of Cabka’s end markets. This was especially notable in the US  where key customers deliberately chose to restrict their CAPEX spending. It resulted in overall lower market demand and pricing pressure across the industry especially in the second half of the year. Going into 2024 we expect to see a recovery by Q2.In the context of these challenging market circumstances  Cabka posted full year sales in 2023 of €197 million  6% lower compared to the record sales achieved in 2022 of €209 million. The decline in sales was driven by the divestment of the PVC business  and declining sales in the non-strategic contract manufacturing segment. The continued focus on product innovations enabled Cabka to mitigate market headwinds and deliver stable sales across its strategic segments  while the reopening of our operations in the US allows us to recover the market share lost due to the flooding.Although sales declined  our operational EBITDA has increased by 8% from €22.5 million in 2022 to €24.2 million in 2023  representing an improvement of our operational EBITDA over Sales from 10.8% to 12.3%. Contributing factors are the continued recovery of our gross margins due to lower variable costs  and a gradual shift towards higher value-add products. On top strict cost discipline resulted in a limited increase of fixed costs against a background of high inflation.Despite slow sales at the start of the year  the current recovery of order intake and pipeline of new product launches underpins our expectations of delivering mid-single digit sales growth for the full year  and an EBITDA margin within the 13-15% range.”Financial HighlightsTotal sales for the full year of 2023 amounted to €197 million  6% lower compared to the record sales achieved in 2022 of €209 million. Sales in strategic segments remained stable at € 187 million. Decline driven by a € 11 million lower sales in the divested PVC business and non-strategic Contract Manufacturing.Consolidation of Cabka’s strong European position in RTP Portfolio  sales up 2%.Customized Solutions growth of 20%  driven by new product launches in Europe and sales to Target in the US.ECO sales growth of 8%  following the completion of its capacity expansion in Q1 2023Operational gross profit at € 99.8 million (2022: € 92.6 million)  bringing the gross margin to 51% (2022: 44%).Operational EBITDA increased to € 24.2 million (2022: € 22.5 million)  reflecting a margin improvement of 1.5pp to 12.3% (2022: 10.8%).Net Income from operations improved 50% to € 2.5 million (2022: € 1.6 million).Net IFRS Income improved to € -0.7 million (2022: € -29.8 million  mainly as a result of non-cash listing expenses).Net Working Capital at € 27.1 million or 13.7% of sales (2022: € 38.3 million  respectively 18.3%)  leading to a strong improvement in cash flow from operations to € 27.1 million (€ 5.3 million).Net debt € 56.8 million including lease obligations (2022: € 44.6 million) Total CAPEX of € 30.9 million (2022: €24.6 million)  including maintenance & replacement investments of € 7.4 million  3.8% of sales.An agreement was reached with a consortium of banks on a new initial debt facility of € 80 million for four years at improved terms.Dividend: the company proposes a cash distribution of € 0.15 per Ordinary Share  subject to AGM approval.Strategic & Market HighlightsNew co-development products launched with our customers include: the CabFold hybrid for BMW  the CabFold Prime for CHEP  the Red Bull BigBag pallet  the IFCO Hybrid pallet  the Xella Nestable pallet and the Continental tire pallet.A two-year framework agreement with Tesla was signed  coming into effect in 2024Recycled raw material inflow at 89% (2022: 86%) of total compared to a European recycling average 1 of 14%of 14% Cabka North America’s plant in St. Louis (MO) fully up and running since July 2023 after 2022 flooding.Consolidation and expansion of our ECO business completed in Q1 2023.Divestment of non-strategic PVC business completed in Q4 2023.Condensed bridge from operational to IFRS consolidated statement of profit and loss  2023 preliminary unaudited 2in € million20232022ChangeRevenues 196.9 208.9 -6% Other operating income items 3.4 11.9 -72% Total Operating Income 200.3 220.8 -9% Expenses for materials  energy and purchased services (100.5) (128.2) -22% Gross Profit 99.8 92.6 8%Operating expenses (75.6) (70.0) 8% Operational EBITDA 24.2 22.5 7% Depreciation  amortization and impairment of intangible and tangible fixed assets (16.9) (18.0) -6% EBIT /Operating Income 7.3 4.5 60% Financial results (4.0) (2.4) 69% Earnings before taxes 3.3 2.2 51% Taxes (0.8) (0.5) 52% Net income from operations 2.5 1.6 50% Non-operational items IPO listing expenses3 - (26.8) IPO other related costs (1.1) (3.2) ECO restructuring - (0.6) St. Louis Flooding4 (3.2) (6.9) Tax on non-operational items 1.0 6.0 Non-controlling interest -0.1 Net result reported IFRS (0.7) (29.7)DistributionProposed cash distribution of € 0.15 per ordinary share  subject to AGM approval.Medium-term guidance updateIn light of the inflationary pressure impacting industries across the board  Cabka reviewed its medium-term guidance for the period 2021-2026. Cabka reiterates its guidance on high single digit sales growth  maintenance and replacement CAPEX (~4%)  Net Working Capital at approximately 20% of sales and pay-out ratio of net profit (~30-35%). Given the continued and increasing impact of inflation on margins we now expect to grow EBITDA margin towards 17% by 2026.OutlookAfter a slow start of 2024  full year mid-single digit sales growth expected  and EBITDA margin within the 13-15% range.COMPREHENSIVE OVERVIEW 2023Sales performanceSales in 2023 are to be considered in the context of challenging general market circumstances  with increasing interest rates leading to significant destocking and restricted capital investments from customers in most of Cabka’s end markets. This resulted in overall lower market demand and pricing pressure across the industry.In 2023  Cabka realized € 196.9 million in sales  6% lower compared to the record sales of€ 208.9 million in 2022. Lower total sales were driven by the divestment of the PVC business  and declining sales in the non-strategic contract manufacturing segment. The continued focus on product innovations enabled Cabka to mitigate market headwinds  resulting in stable sales across strategic segments.Aligned with our strategy  Cabka continued its focus on product innovations throughout 2023. Sales from Customized Solutions demonstrated strong growth in 2023 increasing with 20.3% to € 53.0 million (2022: € 44.0 million). The increase was predominately driven by new products launched in close partnership with CHEP  Continental  and BMW and sales to Target in the US.Given challenging market circumstances  with rising interest rates and the destocking effect noted in the end markets of Cabka  our RTP portfolio business was robust  increasing with 1.9% to €68.1 million in 2023 (2022: €66.8 million).The consolidation and expansion of our ECO business was concluded by the end of the first quarter in 2023. This strategic decision already proved positive results  delivering 7.6% sales growth in 2023 to realize a total revenue of €24.5 million (2022: €22.8 million).Cost developmentsRaw material costs prices and the energy prices reduced significantly in 2023  after the steep increases in 2022. We noted stabilizing prices in the second half of 2023  also resulting from our stringent energy hedging policy. Together with an active diversification of our energy sources  it significantly helped to control our variable costs.The reopening of the US plant in the second half of 2023 allowed us to avoid further expensive tolling costs. With our own in-house production and recycling lines back on track we expect our margins to further strengthen. Consequently  our operational gross margin improved to 50.7% (2022: 44.3%)Operating expenses increased 8%  predominantly driven by the impact of inflation on personnel costs  but also on all other operating expenses  such as insourced services  insurances  audit fees and repairs & maintenance costs. Also  certain key vacancies in sales were successfully filled.Depreciation and amortization decreased by 6.3% to € 16.9 million  due to lower depreciation of fixed assets in the US whilst production was not yet operational.EBITDAIn 2023  Cabka achieved an operational EBITDA of € 24.2 million  which is a 7.5% increase compared to 2022 of € 22.5 million  representing 1.5 pp improvement in operational EBITDA over Sales from 10.8% to 12.3%. Operational EBITDA improved as a result of lower variable costs leading to continued recovery in gross margin  a gradual shift towards higher value-add products and strict cost control limiting the impact of high inflation on fixed costs.Debt Facility RenewalIn December 2023  Cabka reached an agreement with a consortium of banks on a new initial debt facility of € 80 million for four years  which includes extension options for up to two years. The new initial facility is agreed at improved terms and conditions for Cabka. It consists of two parts: namely a € 30 million term facility and € 50 million revolving credit facility  replacing the € 27 million outstanding debt facility and the € 30 million initial revolving credit facility. The facility will be used to enhance Cabka’s growth and innovation capabilities and organizational flexibility.Net Working CapitalNet Working Capital position was € 27.1 million or 13.7% of sales as per 31 December 2023 which is well within our medium-term guidance. Compared to the 31 December position of € 38.3 million  the net working capital position decreased by 29.3%.The movement in Net Working Capital for the year was € 11.2 million5. The positive movement in Net Working Capital is the result of a € 9.7 million decrease in inventory  followed by a decrease in trade receivables and other current assets of € 4.2 million. This was partially offset by a decrease in trade payables and other current liabilities of € 2.7 million.The decline in inventory value was the result of active inventory management  stabilizing raw material and energy costs  and delivery of moulds to our customers in 2023 versus 2022. Active reduction of our raw materials inventory led to a decrease in trade payables.

Without this change  the revenue would have remained stable compared to 2022  at €81 million. The current EBITDA  which is not affected by this change  stands at €6 million  representing 8% margin  in line with the latest guidance communicated by the group.Overall  the past exercise demonstrated Prodways Group's ability to remain profitable and maintain sound financial discipline in this transitional year of 2023 and despite the decline in sales of new printers. The company generated €4 million in cash from operations[1] and overall generated a positive cash flow variation.Consolidated income statement 2023(in € millions) FY 2023 FY 2022 Change(M€) Change(%) Revenues 74 6 80 7 -6 1 -8% Current EBITDA 2 6 0 11 4 -5 4 -48% Current EBITDA margin 8% 14% -6 pts - Income from ordinary activities 1 0 5 8 -2 3 -82% Other elements of operating income -13 6 -0 8 -12 8 - Operating income -12 6 4 9 -17 5 - Financial results  tax and minorities interest -1 4 -3 3 +1 9 - Net result -14 0 1 6 -15 6 -2023 revenues: €75 million.The revenues for the year 2023 have decreased compared to last year  mainly due to the change in recognition of Software activity revenues since July3 (impact of -6.5 million euros  with no effect on current EBITDA in absolute value). Furthermore  the weakness in sales of new 3D printers and associated materials  particularly in the fourth quarter  has weighed on Prodways' performance. The Products division remains well-oriented with a growth of +11% in 2023.A dedicated press release on the 2023 revenue was published on February 14  2024 (link to the press release).A current EBITDA margin of 8%Prodways Group achieved a current EBITDA of €6 million in 2023  below last year's level but in line with its expectations in this year of transition and investment.This decrease in profitability of €5 million compared to the year 2022 is explained by:A exceptional product in 2022 linked to a debt waiver in the USA (- €1 million)Strengthening of commercial teams (- €0.4 million).A loss on the activity of small printers for jewelry (- €1 million).The decrease in sales of industrial printers in 2023 (- €1.5 million).To get back on track and achieve a two-digit EBITDA margin  Prodways Group has taken a number of measures in 2023 and early 2024  including:The cessation of small printers activity for jewelry ( see the dedicated press release on this subject ).). The expansion of the industrial printer commercial pipeline  resulting from the professionalization of the Sales & Marketing teams.Overall  reducing staff to regain an important operational lever by focusing on the profitable activities of the group.An operating income exceptionally impacted by the cessation of small printer activity.Depreciation and non-exceptional impairments remained at a relatively stable level. Therefore  in 2023  Prodways Group maintains a positive operating income of €1 million.The other elements of the operating income  for - €13 6 million  correspond to exceptional impacts related to the decision to focus on the industrial segment for the printer activity. They include - €17 million of non-cash items (including depreciations of tangible and intangible assets and impairment) and + €3 million of capital gains related to the sale of Prodways Group's stake in Smilers  which has a positive effect on cash flow.As a reminder  this stake in Smilers was acquired in 2014 for €1.1 million in a context of the emergence of 3D printing for the production of orthodontic alignment trays. She generated a revenue of €4 million in April 2023 and a significant capital gain of €2.9 million.The operating income is therefore - €12.6 million in 2023.After taking into account financial expenses and tax charges  the net result stands at - €14 million.A positive cash-flow and sound financial discipline.Prodways Group has transformed its cash result and generated a self-financing capacity of €4.1 million in 2023  despite a year of transition and declining printer sales. The group also significantly reduced its working capital requirement by + €1.4 million  as it had announced at the beginning of the year 2023.The level of capex remained stable at €3.3 million  and the operations of acquiring and selling subsidiaries brought in €2.7 million in cash (sale of the stake in Biotech Dental for €4 million and payment of the purchase price supplement for Auditech).Thus  Prodways Group achieved a positive cash flow variation of €2.1 million in 2023. The available cash has therefore increased  reaching €16 million  and the net debt has therefore decreased. It remains at a low level of - €2.9 million.The consolidated financial statements are available in the appendix at the end of this press release.Results by division4(in €million) FY 2023 FY 2022 Change(M€) Change(%) Systems Revenues 39 5 49 3 -9 8 -20% Current EBITDA 3 5 8 2 -4 8 -58% Current EBITDA margin (%) 9% 17% -8 pts - Income from ordinary activities 1 7 5 6 -3 9 -69% Products Revenues 35 3 31 7 +3 6 11% Current EBITDA 3 9 4 3 -0 4 -9% Current EBITDA margin (%) 11% 14% -3 pts - Income from ordinary activities 0 6 1 1 -0 6 n.aThe Systems division generated €40 million in revenue in 2023  mainly impacted by Prodways Group's change in classification from Principal to Agent as of July 1  2023. This change results in a decrease in revenue (- € 6.5 million compared to the old classification) without any impact on the current EBITDA in absolute value.The current EBITDA margin of this division was heavily impacted by the decline in printer sales in 2023 and stands at 9%. This division also benefited in 2022 from an exceptional item related to the abandonment of a receivable in the USA.The Products division continued to grow in 2023  by +11%  both thanks to the successful integration of Auditech and organic performance (+5%).This division recorded a decrease of €0.4 million in its current EBITDA in 2023  mainly due to the strengthening of the Sales & Marketing teams during the year. These actions will begin to bear fruit in early 2024 and should contribute to significantly larger results in the future.Comparison base for 2024The set of measures implemented and the change in revenue recognition in the Software activity significantly modify the group's revenue profile in 2024  while structurally improving the generation of current EBITDA in absolute value.As an indication  if all the measures and changes previously announced had been effective from January 1st  2023  the revenues generated by Prodways Group in 2023 would have been around €59 million5.Outlook: revenue growth and improved results from 2024The measures aimed at improving the profitability of the group  combined with the reorganization and professionalization of the Sales & Marketing teams  should produce structural effects as early as 2024. The important elements to monitor for the coming semesters are as follows:The cessation of jewelry activity and the refocusing on the MovingLight® range should be finalized by the end of the summer. This action plan will notably weigh on the profitability of the first half of 2024 (a little over €1 million in exceptional costs)  but will have a positive impact on the current EBITDA from the second semester.Revenue recognition for software as an agent on a full-year basis and the transition to SaaS mode  with a smoothing effect on revenue over time. However  this change opens up an opportunity to gain new customers in a changing market.For 2024  the company aims for an increase in its revenue compared to based on €59 million in 2023 and an increase in its current EBITDA rate.About Prodways GroupProdways Group is a specialist in industrial and professional 3D printing with a unique positioning as an integrated European player.

The audit reports on historical financial information are not qualified. What are the key risks that are specific to the Issuer? Business and Economic Conditions: The Issuer's financial results may be affected to varying degrees by the general business and economic conditions in the geographic regions in which the Issuer operates. These conditions may include factors such as consumer saving and spending habits as well as consumer borrowing and repayment patterns  unemployment rates  the impact of containment measures associated with the COVID-19 pandemic or other health crises on businesses' operations  the level of business investment and overall business sentiment  the level of activity and volatility of the financial markets  inflation  the level of government spending  monetary policies that are adopted by the BoC  the Federal Reserve in the U.S.  the European Central Bank in the European Union and monetary authorities in other jurisdictions in which the Issuer operates  and the fiscal policies of the governments of Canada  the U.S.  Europe and such other jurisdictions. Such policies can also adversely affect the Issuer's clients and counterparties in Canada  the U.S. and internationally  which may increase the risk of default by such clients and counterparties. For example  economic downturns may result in higher unemployment rates and lower household incomes  lower corporate earnings  changes in business investment and consumer spending  and could adversely affect the Issuer's business  including but not limited to the demand for its loan and other products and result in lower earnings  including higher credit losses. The Issuer's financial results are also sensitive to changes in interest rates and to weaker investor confidence and market conditions  which may lead to lower client activity and unfavourable changes in earnings. Additional risks are emerging around how countries will seek to recoup the unprecedented levels of stimulus measures introduced in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and balance budgets in the future  and around the potential implications that a prolonged low interest rate environment will have  for example  on increasing wealth inequality and extended retirement ages  among others. Information Technology and Cyber Risks: Information technology (IT) and cyber risks remain top risks  not only for the financial services sector  but for other industries worldwide. Cybersecurity is the risk to the business associated with cyber-attacks initiated to disrupt or disable the Issuer's operations or to expose or damage data. The Issuer continues to be subject to heightened risks in the form of cyberattacks  data breaches  cyber extortion and similar compromises  due to: (i) the size  scale  and global nature of the Issuer's operations; (ii) the Issuer's heavy reliance on the internet to conduct day-to-day business activities; (iii) the Issuer's intricate technological infrastructure; and (iv) the Issuer's use of third-party service providers. Additionally  clients' use of personal devices can create further avenues for potential cyber-related incidents  as the Issuer has little or no control over the safety of these devices. IT and cyber risks have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic  as increased malicious activities are creating more threats for cyberattacks including COVID-19 phishing emails  malware-embedded mobile apps that purport to track infection rates  and targeting of vulnerabilities in remote access platforms as many companies continue to operate with work from home arrangements. Resulting implications could include business interruptions  service disruptions  financial loss  theft of intellectual property and confidential information  litigation  enhanced regulatory attention and penalties  as well as reputational damage. Furthermore  the adoption of emerging technologies  such as cloud computing  AI and robotics  call for continued focus and investment to manage risks effectively. Not managing this risk effectively may have an adverse effect on the Issuer's financial performance and condition. Privacy  Data and Third Party Related Risks: The collection  use and sharing of data  as well as the management and governance of data  are increasingly important as the Issuer continues to invest in digital solutions and innovation  as well as  expanding its 3business activities. Data management is the risk of failing to manage information appropriately throughout its lifecycle due to inadequate processes and controls  resulting in legal or regulatory consequences  reputational damage or financial loss. In addition to the management and governance of data  its collection  use  and sharing also remain a top risk given the high value attributed to the Issuer's data. Resulting implications from failing to manage this risk could include financial loss  theft of intellectual property and confidential information  litigation  enhanced regulatory attention and penalties  as well as reputational damage. Privacy risk is the risk of improper creation or collection  use  disclosure  retention or destruction of information. Effective privacy and information management practices continue to grow in importance  as demonstrated by the continued development of complex regulations in the jurisdictions in which the Issuer operates and recent regulatory developments relating to data privacy. The Chief Privacy Office and the Chief Data Office partner with cross- functional teams to develop and implement enterprise-wide standards and practices that describe how data is used  protected  managed and governed. The Issuer's potential exposure to these risks also increases as the Issuer continues to partner with third-party service providers and adopt new technologies (e.g.  cloud computing  AI and machine learning  etc.) and business models. Third-party risk is the risk of failure to effectively manage third parties which may expose the Issuer to service disruptions  regulatory action  financial loss  litigation or reputational damage. Privacy  data and third-party related risks have been heightened as the use of work from home arrangements have become common practice. As the majority of the Issuer's employees continue to work from home  it is continuously monitoring and enforcing best practices as it seeks to maintain the privacy and confidentiality of all sensitive information. The Issuer's security awareness program is required to be completed by each employee annually and includes cyber awareness training on managing risks while working remotely. Third-party providers critical to its operations are being monitored for any impact on their ability to deliver services  including vendors of its third-party providers. Failure to properly onboard and manage service providers may expose the Issuer to service disruption  financial loss and other risks that may negatively impact its financial performance and condition. Regulatory Changes: The ongoing introduction of new or revised regulations will continue to lead to increasing focus across the organization on meeting additional regulatory requirements across the multiple jurisdictions in which the Issuer operates. See ""Business segment results"" on pages 26 to 48 of the 2020 MD&A incorporated by reference in the Base Prospectus for information on the Issuer's business segments and the jurisdictions in which they operate. Financial and other reforms that have come into effect or are coming into effect  across multiple jurisdictions  such as Canadian anti-money laundering regulations  the interest rate benchmark reform  as well as data  privacy  consumer protection regulations  Canadian benchmark rate for qualifying insured mortgages and client focused reforms  continue to provide challenges and impact the Issuer's operations and strategies and may negatively impact its financial performance  condition and prospects. Digital Disruption and Innovation: The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the way consumers interact with financial services providers. Demand for digital banking services has increased  and while this represents an opportunity for the Issuer to leverage its technological advantage  the need to meet the rapidly evolving needs of clients and compete with non- traditional competitors has increased the Issuer's strategic and reputational risks. Additional risks also continue to emerge as demographic trends  evolving client expectations  the increased power to analyze data and the emergence of disruptors are creating competitive pressures across a number of sectors. Moreover  established technology companies  newer competitors  and regulatory changes continue to foster new business models that could challenge traditional banks and financial products. Finally  while the adoption of new technologies  such as AI and machine learning  presents opportunities for the Issuer  it could result in new and complex strategic  reputational  operational  regulatory and compliance risks that would need to be managed effectively and  if not  may adversely impact its financial performance and condition.

""In this rapidly evolving therapeutic space  driven by the growing challenges of antimicrobial resistance  our strategic focus is on the most resistant bacterial infections  and primarily those related to Staphylococcus aureus. We are therefore pleased to be in close discussions with potential pharma partners and global health authorities  which both confirm the relevance of our strategy. More specifically  the recent feedback received from the FDA and the EMA provide us with clear guidelines for the design of our next global Phase 2 study in Prosthetic Joint Infections. Furthermore  we are about to start the evaluation of our anti-Staphylococcus aureus phages in the endocarditis infections in France. Together  with the growing body of clinical data from the Compassionate and Early-Access treatments  we hope that we can successfully execute our clinical plan with anti-Staphylococcus aureus phages. The field is clearly moving fast forward  as shown by recent global deals  and we are well positioned to become a leading phage-therapy player able to address the most critical indications for which there is currently no relevant solution  particularly for Prosthetic Joint Infections  for which we are frontrunners.""MARKET HIGHLIGHTSPhage therapy sector in a spotlight with recent M&A and refinancing dealsOn March 6  2024  BiomX  a clinical-stage phage-therapy company  announced the acquisition of Adaptive Phage Therapeutics (APT)  concurrently with a private placement financing of $50 million  involving several top-tier institutional investors (Deerfield  Orbimed). In the meantime  Armata Pharmaceuticals announced a $35 million refinancing deal.These important transactions demonstrate the growing attractiveness of phage therapy  where PHAXIAM has a prominent role with its unique and leading positioning in Prosthetic Joint Infections (PJI)  as the most advanced Phage therapy player in Europe.BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTSa)Confirmed strategic focus on Phage Therapy in high-value indications with a strong competitive positionPHAXIAM has been refocusing its clinical development programs in indications of high medical needs  mainly for patients with severe and resistant Staphylococcus aureus (S. Aureus) infections  often associated with high mortality and budget impact.This is particularly the case for PJI  where PHAXIAM has a reinforced strategic and leading position. With the signs of clinical activity  we are observing in our compassionate and early-access (AAC  Autorisation d'Accès Compassionnel - the French early access program) patients  and a best-suited approach of local administration of phages allowed in this indication  we strongly believe that PJI is the best option to bring phages as soon as possible as a first indication toward proof-of-concept and registration.Beyond PJI  as lead indication  PHAXIAM has launched another strategic clinical study (Phase I PK) in Endocarditis infections  reinforcing its ambition to be a leader in innovative therapies to those patients who failed traditional antimicrobial treatments.b)Significant progress in Clinical and Regulatory strategy for the S. aureus programProsthetic Joint Infections (PJI): set for the first global Phase 2 study potentially enabling an Early Access Pathway in EuropeLeveraging on promising activity signals from real-life compassionate treatments and valuable insights from the current PhagoDAIR pilot study  PHAXIAM is preparing the initiation of the 1 st global (EU/US) Phase 2 study for PJI patients (Hip or Knee prosthesis) having an open-surgery debridement (DAIR) in combination with antibiotics.PHAXIAM has received positive and consistent feedback from both the FDA (Pre-IND meeting) and the EMA (Scientific Advice) with a view to launching this large-scale study  including the following key points and recommendations:Confirmation of the value of a clinical development in this indication; Confirmation that PHAXIAM's non-clinical data and CMC capabilities support a formal clinical development plan in Europe and in the United States; Confirmation of the target population and the Standard of Care to be considered; the exclusion/inclusion criteria allow to target a population approximately 6 times larger compared to the current PhagoDAIR study; Clear and consistent guidelines and expectations in terms of CMC and clinical endpoints.PHAXIAM considers (1) accelerating the transitioning of PJI clinical development effort into the new and more ambitious global Phase 2 proof-of-concept study  (2) providing PhagoDAIR pilot study clinical data at the end of 2024.The Phase 2 proof-of-concept study is intended to be a multicentric  randomized  double-blind trial and is expected to include 100 patients in Europe and the US. PHAXIAM intends to file a Clinical Trial Application (CTA) with the EMA and the FDA in mid-2024 in view of starting patient enrollment in early 2025.Upon a successful completion of this clinical study (2H 2026)  PHAXIAM may potentially open an Early Access Pathway for the registration of a first phage therapy treatment for PJI in Europe.Endocarditis Infections (EI): initiate a 2 nd clinical study in an indication targeting vital cardiac valves infectionsPHAXIAM has obtained approvals from the French ANSM and South-East II-Lyon Ethics Committee to launch a phase 1 study (PK data) in Endocarditis Infections caused by S. aureus  to evaluate the safety of intravenous administration (IV) of its anti-S. aureus phages.The study  conducted in 5 French hospitals  is about to start and should enroll 12 patients requiring replacement of an infected heart valve.First clinical results are expected in H2 2024. If positive  these results could allow PHAXIAM to (1) accelerate a clinical development in this indication and to (2) use the IV administration for other indications requiring this administration route  such as bacteriemia.c)Robust real-life activity data obtained from compassionate treatmentsIn June 2022  the ANSM granted PHAXIAM an AAC (Autorisation d'Accès Compassionnel) and  to date  approximately 100 patients have already been treated under this regulatory status for different indications  with a majority in PJI indication.Data from the first 77 patients evaluated so far show promising results with infection control at 3 months (clinical endpoint)  reaching approximately 80%  considered as a significant improvement over standard of care (SoC) in this hard-to-treat patient population with severe resistant infections  often undergoing 2nd or 3rd line SoC antibiotic treatment.PHAXIAM has applied for a second AAC regulatory validation  for PJI patients associated with P. aeruginosa resistance. This AAC is currently being evaluated by the ANSM for a potential final validation in 2024.d)Partnering optionsAs part of its strategic development strategy  PHAXIAM is entertaining partnership discussions with pharmaceutical companies  to investigate relevant collaboration options.e)Complementary Investigator-sponsored trialsIn addition to PHAXIAM's clinical activities  two French university hospitals are preparing for Investigator-Sponsored Trials (IST) with PHAXIAM's phages. These studies are the opportunity for PHAXIAM to potentially bring additional clinical POC data in other high-value indications:Phase 2 IST in Diabetic Foot Ulcer (DFU): this clinical study by Nîmes Hospitals  is targeting DFU infections due to mono-bacterial S. aureus infection.Phase 2 IST in complex Respiratory Tract Infections (VAP): this clinical study by La Pitié Salpêtrière Hospital in Paris  is targeting nosocomial pulmonary infections due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa  including patients with ventilation-associated pneumopathies (VAP)  a growing concern in hospital environments.Investigator-initiated studies are funded by hospital's clinical research programs and their execution and schedule are entirely under the responsibility of the sponsoring centers.FY 2023 FINANCIAL RESULTSKey financial figures for the twelve months of 2023 compared with the same period of the previous year are summarized below. In the context of the Erytech-Pherecydes merger  PHAXIAM's consolidated financial statements in IFRS standards include ex-Pherecydes financial results as from the date of the merger  i.e. June 23  2023.Consequently  PHAXIAM's P&L information for the full-year 2023 include 12 months of ex-Erytech activities and 6 months of ex-Pherecydes activities.In thousands of euros FY202312 monthsFY202212 monthsRevenues - - Net income from asset sale 24 351 Other income 1 326 6 647 Operating income 1 326 30 998 Research and development (10 910) (19 907) General and administrative (14 076) (13 887) Operating expenses (24 986) (33 793) Operating income (loss) (23 660) (2 796) Financial income 474 4 453 Financial expenses (511) (1 364) Financial income (loss) 37 3 089 Income tax 208 (521) Net loss (23 488) (227)Operating expenses of €25.0 million in the full-year 2023 were €8.8 million lower (-26%) than in the previous year.The decrease was driven by the reduction of ex-Erytech R&D expenses  mostly related to the closing of Princeton operations and the termination of clinical development activities  while new ex-Pherecydes development activities were integrated in the P&L as of 2H 2023. Overall  R&D expenses were reduced by €9.0 million (-45%) year-over-year. PHAXIAM's G&A expenses in the full-year 2023 were stable year-over-year (+€0.2 million  i.e. +1%)  including one-off expenses related to the merger and integration activities.Net loss for the full-year 2023 was €23.5 million  compared with a net loss of €0.2 million for the same period of 2022  which benefited from the €24.4 million net gain on the sale of the Princeton facility in April 2022.As of December 31  2023  PHAXIAM had cash and cash equivalents totaling €10.5 million (approximately $11.6 million)  compared with €38.8 million as of December 31  2022. The €28.3 million decrease in cash position during the twelve months of 2023 was the result of a €24.3 million net cash utilization in operating activities and investing activities and €3.7 million used in financing activities  mostly related to the reimbursement of the 'PGE' Covid-loan  while the variation of the U.S. dollar against the euro led to a €0.3 million negative currency exchange impact.The current cash position can fund PHAXIAM's programs and planned operating expenses into September 2024.EFFECTIVENESS OF VOLUNTARY DELISTING OF AMERICAN DEPOSITARY SHARES FROM NASDAQ STOCK MARKETOn March 11  2024  PHAXIAM announced that the Company's voluntary delisting of American Depositary Shares (""ADSs"") representing its ordinary shares from The Nasdaq Capital Market had become effective. This delisting significantly reduces PHAXIAM's cash utilization and enables the Company to focus its financial resources on key development and value milestones.The Company remains listed on Euronext Paris as its primary trading market and intends to continue its disclosures in compliance with applicable French financial market regulations.KEY NEWSFLOW AND MILESTONES EXPECTED OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHSFirst Patient-In for Phase 1 study in EI (2Q 2024)CTA filing for the global Phase 2 study in PJI (3Q 2024)Global Phase 2 study in PJI Approval (4Q 2024)PhagoDAIR pilot study in PJI clinical data (end 2024)Preliminary PK data from the Phase 1 study in EI (2H 2024)Launch of the global Phase 2 study in PJI (early 1Q 2025)FY 2023 CONFERENCE CALL DETAILSPHAXIAM management will hold a conference call and webcast on Thursday  March 21  2024  at 9:30am ET / 2:30pm CET on the 2023 Full-Year results and Business Update.

(""EQT"")  Marc Nolet's family through its investment company (""Nolet"")  as well as certain other investors (together  the ""Pre-Committing Investors"")  have committed to submit subscription orders for new shares in the Offering for an aggregate amount of approximately EUR 8.5 million (assuming an Offering for an aggregate amount of approximately EUR 12.0 million).Notwithstanding the foregoing  the Offering will be open to institutional  qualified  professional and/or other investors  as permitted under applicable private placement exemptions  and any final allocation to investors  as the case may be  will be made based on customary objective and pre-identified criteria. No guarantee will be or has been given as to the final allocation to the Pre-Committing Investors nor any other investors  shareholders or persons  that any allocation will be made to them  or as to the size of any such allocation.It is currently anticipated that the number of shares to be issued in the Offering shall exceed the number of shares that can be admitted to listing and trading on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels without listing prospectus. The Pre-Committing Investors agreed that the Company and the Underwriter will have the ability to allocate new shares that shall not be immediately admitted to listing and trading upon their issuance. In view hereof  the Company undertakes to apply to the regulated market of Euronext Brussels for the admission to trading and listing of those unlisted new shares  as soon as practicable after their issuance. Furthermore  a share swap agreement (the ""Share Swap Agreement"") will be entered into with EQT in order to be able to deliver listed shares to all investors who receive allocated listed shares in the Offering. As part of this Share Swap Agreement  EQT will deliver a sufficient number of existing and listed shares to the Underwriter (acting as settlement agent)  and will in exchange receive the same number of newly issued unlisted shares. The unlisted shares that EQT will receive as a result of the share swap will be admitted to listing and trading upon approval of a listing prospectus by the Belgian Financial Services and Markets Authority (FSMA). More information on the application of Article 7:97 of the Belgian Companies and Associations Code  in connection with the share swap can be found below.In relation to the Offering  the Company has agreed with the Underwriter to a 180-days standstill period on future share issuances waivable by the Underwriter and subject to (i) an exception for the issuance of a number of shares  subscription rights or other securities exercisable  convertible or exchangeable for shares pursuant to alternative or additional funding obtained by the Company provided that the gross proceeds from the issuance of such alternative funding securities do not exceed an amount equal to the higher of (x) the final gross proceeds of the Offering  and (y) EUR 14 million  and (ii) other customary exceptions. The members of the executive management have agreed with the Underwriter to a market customary 180-days lock-up period waivable by the Underwriter and subject to customary exceptions. Furthermore  subject to completion of the Offering  Partners in Equity  Rosetta Capital and EQT have indicated their willingness to enter into a market customary 90-days lock-up period  waivable by the Underwriter and subject to customary exceptions.Mandatory Convertible Loan ConversionAs announced in February 2024  the Company entered into an unsecured and subordinated convertible loan agreement with Partners in Equity and Rosetta Capital for an aggregate principal amount of EUR 3.0 million. The terms of said loan agreement provide that the aggregate principal amounts and interests under such loan agreement shall be mandatorily converted into new shares (through a contribution in kind of payables) in the event of an equity financing transaction by the Company for at least EUR 7.0 million (in gross proceeds) at a conversion price per share equal to the issue price in said equity financing transaction  minus a discount of 45%. If the Company would raise an amount of at least EUR 7.0 via the Offering  the relevant loans will have to be mandatorily converted into new shares at the aforementioned conversion price. Such conversion would be completed after the completion of the Offering.Trading update FY 2023On 28 March 2024  the Company will announce the details of its consolidated financial results for the financial year ended 31 December 2023. Certain key elements of past year's performance are as follows:Revenues: Revenue decreased from EUR 0.92 million in 2022 to EUR 0.71 million in 2023 due to the decision to scale back European commercial activities in April 2023. Since 8 February 2024  European activities have been halted to fully focus on the anticipated PMA approval.EBIT: Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) 1 remained broadly unchanged from a loss of EUR 28.09 million in 2022 to a loss of EUR 28.86 million in 2023 and are mainly due to increased operating expenses  mainly due to the preparations of the submissions for marketing approval of the alfa pump in the US and Canada.Net loss for FY 2023: Net loss increased from EUR 30.76 million in 2022 to EUR 32.56 million in 2023Cash position at 31 December 2023: The Company ended 2023 with a total cash and cash equivalents amount of EUR 2.6 million (2022: EUR 18.9 million)  mainly impacted from operating activity.Disclosures in accordance with Article 7:97  §4/1 of the Belgian Companies and Associations CodeThe following information is provided  as far as needed and applicable  pursuant to Article 7:97  §4/1 of the Belgian Companies and Associations Code in connection with the entering into of the Share Swap Agreement between EQT  the Underwriter  and the Company.EQT is a shareholder of the Company and is represented on the board of directors of the Company. As a result  it could be considered as a ""related party"" within the meaning of the International Financial Reporting Standards  as adopted by the European Union (IFRS)  as referred to in Article 7:97 of the Belgian Companies and Associations Code. In view hereof  the board of directors of the Company applied  as far as needed and applicable  the procedure of Article 7:97 of the Belgian Companies and Associations Code in connection with the approval of the entering into of the Share Swap Agreement. Rudy Dekeyser (a director  representing EQT) did not participate in the deliberation and voting by the board of directors in relation to the approval of the entering into of the Share Swap Agreement and the Offering.Within the context of the aforementioned procedure  prior to the launch of the Offering and the entering into of the Share Swap Agreement  a committee of three independent directors of the Company (the ""Committee"") issued an advice to the board of directors in which the Committee assessed the entering into of the Share Swap Agreement (in the framework of the Offering). In its advice to the board of directors  the Committee concluded the following:""The Committee believes that the envisaged capital raising  and the contemplated involvement of EQT in the Transaction through a share swap arrangement  are in the interest of the Company and all of its shareholders  and are not manifestly abusive.Notably  the share swap by EQT (who will not receive any compensation in this respect from the Company) will enable the intervening Underwriter to exchange a number of new shares to be issued in the Transaction against a number of listed shares of EQT  so that the Underwriter can deliver such listed shares to the ultimate investors that will participate in the Transaction. This will allow the Company to raise more funds via the Transaction than it would otherwise be able to raise if the Underwriter would only be able to deliver shares that are not yet admitted to listing and trading immediately upon their issuance. Accordingly  the share swap is expected to facilitate the Company's fund raising efforts and is likely to contribute to its success.Furthermore  while the envisaged capital raising itself may entail a dilution for the shareholders and holders of subscription rights (stock options) of the Company  a successful capital raising is in the interest of the Company. If the Company is not able to raise further funding in order to address its (short term) funding requirements  the Company's going concern can no longer be guaranteed.In view hereof  the Committee issues a favourable and unqualified opinion to the board of directors of the Company.""The Company's board of directors did not deviate from the Committee's favourable and unqualified conclusion. The Company's statutory auditor's assessment of the Committee's opinion and the minutes of the Company's meeting of the board of directors relating to the entering into of the Share Swap Agreement  is as follows:""Based on our review  nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the financial and accounting data stated in the advice of the Ad Hoc Committee of Independent Directors dated 18 March 2024 and in the minutes of the board of directors dated 18 March 2024  which motivate in writing and in detail the contemplated transaction  are not  in all material respects  fair and consistent with the information that we have in our possession as part of our engagement.""2024 Financial Calendar Sequana Medical28 March 2024: Publication of Full Year Results 202323 April 2024: Online publication of Annual Report 202323 May 2024: Annual General Meeting 2024For more information  please contact:Sequana MedicalLies VannesteDirector Investor RelationsE: IR@sequanamedical.comT: +32 (0)498 05 35 79About Sequana MedicalSequana Medical NV is a pioneer in treating fluid overload  a serious and frequent clinical complication in patients with liver disease  heart failure and cancer. This causes major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care  they become ineffective  untolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing ""diuretic-resistant"" patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  delivering major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients and reducing costs for healthcare systems.The Company's Premarket Approval (PMA) application for the alfapump was submitted to the US FDA in December 2023 and accepted for substantive review in January 2024  having reported positive primary and secondary endpoint data from the North American pivotal POSEIDON study in recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis. US market approval of the alfapump is anticipated by the end of Q3 2024.Results of the Company's RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure support DSR's mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE  a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study  have been successfully treated with DSR  confirming the strong clinical outcomes seen in the RED DESERT and SAHARA studies. The independent Data Safety Monitoring Board approved the start of the randomized MOJAVE cohort of up to a further 30 patients  which is planned after alfapump US PMA approval.Sequana Medical is listed on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent  Belgium. For further information  please visit www.sequanamedical.com.Important Regulatory DisclaimersThe alfapump® system is currently not approved in the United States or Canada. In the United States and Canada  the alfapump system is currently under clinical investigation (POSEIDON Trial) and is being studied in adult patients with refractory or recurrent ascites due to liver cirrhosis. DSR® therapy is still in development and it should be noted that any statements regarding safety and efficacy arise from ongoing pre-clinical and clinical investigations which have yet to be completed. There is no link between DSR therapy and ongoing investigations with the alfapump system in Europe  the United States or Canada.Note: alfapump® and DSR® are registered trademarks.Important information:The information contained in this announcement is for general information only and does not purport to be full or complete.
