Wilfried Verstraete will be proposed for election by the Board as Chairman of the Board of directors following the company General meeting on June 13th  2024.Wilfried Verstraete today joins the Strategy and Investment committee as well as the Nomination committee and will immediately be involved in the Company’s strategic priorities  as well as in the expected Board of directors evolution.The nomination of Wilfried Verstraete marks a new chapter in Worldline’s development and will allow the Company to successfully enter this new transformation phase. It is consistent with the Board’s willingness to elect a seasoned  international executive  with a proven track record of deep transformation in complex industries within the financial sector. Whilst leading Euler Hermes for c. twelve years  Wilfried Verstraete managed to deeply transform the Group from a traditional trade credit insurer into a leading data-focused fintech providing cutting-edge digital solutions to its clients.In order to facilitate a smooth transition  and in line with governance best practices  the Board of directors has asked Mr. Georges Pauget  interim Chairman of the Board of directors since December 14th  2023  to continue in its current role until the election of Wilfried Verstraete as Chairman.Further reduction in the size of the Board of directorsThe Board of directors is committed to continue the process of reducing the number of its members initiated in 2022  and confirms its willingness for significant renewal as it embarks into a new phase of its strategic journey. It has therefore been decided that  following its next General meeting  the Board composition would be reduced from 15 to 12 Board members - plus two employee directors  whose designation follows a dedicated procedure.As previously announced and whilst preserving a balanced representation of shareholders and strategic partners  the Board will continue with its reduction process whilst maintaining international profiles with a diverse skillset. Some existing Board members will therefore be replaced by new independent directors whose recruitment is currently in-progress  and expected to be finalized by end of April  2024.Finally  the Board of directors decided that amongst these 12 Board members  one non-independent Board member will be designated by Crédit Agricole. This decision takes into account Crédit Agricole’s significant shareholding  as well as its strategic and long-term partnership with the Company through the creation of a joint venture for digital payment services for merchants in France announced on March 20th  2024.The Board of directors will provide further details on its renewed board composition once it has been fully finalized  by the end of April 2024.Georges Pauget  Chairman of Worldline’s Board of directors  declared: “On behalf of the Board  I am glad to welcome Wilfried Verstraete who has all the professional and personal qualities required to accompany the transformation of the group and to prepare with him this transition. As Chairman of the Board  he will bring a wealth of expertise working in complex and evolving industries  and will form with our Chief Executive Officer a complementary and efficient team to execute this new phase of Worldline’s strategic journey.”Wilfried Verstraete  declared: “I am honored to join Worldline’s Board of directors with the perspective of assuming its Chairmanship  and I thank the Board members and its Chairman Georges Pauget for their trust. Worldline is one of the leading global actors of an essential sector offering innovation  technology and payment services to merchants and financial institutions  and I am thankful for being able to contribute to its long-term development. I will be engaged  alongside the management team in this new transformation phase  with a focus on ensuring governance quality and well functioning in the best interest of the Company and its stakeholders. I am looking forward to joining the Strategy and Investment Committee as well as the Nomination committee and start contributing to the Company’s strategic priorities and its expected Board of directors evolution.”Gilles Grapinet  Board member and CEO of Worldline  declared: “I welcome the decision of the Board to propose the nomination of Wilfried Verstraete as future Chairman of Worldline’s Board of directors  and I look forward to our collaboration serving the Company. His international experience and knowledge of the financial industry will be key assets for Worldline as we embark into a new phase of our strategic journey following 10 years of development which cemented our position as a recognized European payment leader.”ABOUT WORLDLINEWorldline [Euronext: WLN] helps businesses of all shapes and sizes to accelerate their growth journey – quickly  simply  and securely.

The operations  composition and competences of the Company's governing bodies are examined in detail in this Report. SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY In the area of Sustainability  the Mondadori Group has reached a level of maturity that has enabled it to move from detailed reporting  in line with the GRI Standards  to a strategic approach based on established ESG guidelines  consistently with the global objectives of the United Nations. Consequently  in 2022  Mondadori was able to draw up its first Sustainability Plan  approved by the Board of Directors with the preparatory  advisory and recommendatory support of the Control  Risks & Sustainability Committee. The Plan sets out quantitative and qualitative targets and short- and medium- term measures for continuous improvement in social  governance and environmental terms. During 2023  the quantitative targets were monitored constantly  making it possible to precisely record the degree of attainment on one hand and identify new future measures for continuous updating of the Plan on the other. In the first half of the year  after a benchmark study  the Group stakeholder map was updated and analysis work continued to identify the current and potential areas of Group impact on the economy  people and the environment of greatest significance. The mapping was accompanied by stakeholder listening events with the active involvement of the management  employees and other equally important interlocutors  including teachers  customers of our bookstores  suppliers and analysts. The results of the analysis led to the identification of the materiality issues with top priority for Mondadori  on which the Group will continue to work with determination and commitment  with a view to continuous improvement and consistently with the strategic guidelines set out in the Sustainability Plan. In preparation for the implementation of the new Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)  the Group also conducted a gap analysis and an initial double materiality exercise to identify the sustainability topics that could have a positive or negative influence on its development and performance. Detailed information on the issues covered by current activities and the guidelines for future Group action in Sustainability and on the definition and development of the related Plan is provided in the 2023 Non- Financial Disclosure available on the www.gruppomondadori.it website and on the 1Info authorised 6storage mechanism (www.1info.it).

George May  Vice President  Small Business  CT Corporation  addresses some of the most frequently asked questions about trusts.“The eligibility of trusts for Beneficial Ownership Information reporting is complicated due to the expansive nature of them ” explains May. “For example  some trusts own multiple reporting interests in companies  while others do not.”“One of the main questions we’ve been hearing is which exemptions might apply to trusts ” says May. “Of the 23 exemptions that apply to beneficial ownership applicability  five of them would most likely pertain to trusts: if they are a large operating company; a bank; a tax-exempt entity; a subsidiary of certain exempt entities; or an inactive entity.”For those trusts that own or control  in whole or in part  reporting companies  the personal information of those reporting companies’ beneficial owners must be reported.“As this new CTA rule now in effect pertains to individuals  a trust itself is not a beneficial owner. A beneficial owner is a single individual ” said May.Those individuals  he explained  could be trustees  beneficiaries  settlors  grantors or others depending upon whether they have substantial control over the reporting company or own at least 25% of the reporting company’s ownership interests.Wolters Kluwer has recently published a white paper clarifying the circumstances under which trusts and the reporting companies they manage must conform to the new BOI reporting requirements. For more information that addresses commonly asked questions regarding BOI compliance  visit CT Corporation’s Beneficial Ownership Frequently Asked Questions webpage.Reporters wishing to arrange an interview on with Wolters Kluwer experts on this topic are invited to contact David Feider  Associate Director  External Communications  Wolters Kluwer FCC.More information on navigating the new beneficial ownership reporting requirements is available on the Wolters Kluwer resource page  “Beneficial Ownership Information Compliance from CT Corporation.”For more information about Wolters Kluwer  please visit: www.wolterskluwer.com.About Wolters KluwerWolters Kluwer (EURONEXT: WKL) is a global leader in information  software solutions and services for professionals in healthcare; tax and accounting; financial and corporate compliance; legal and regulatory; corporate performance and ESG.

Interest rates rose quickly to try and curb inflation but this limited capital investment by many print providers  especially in the United States. In addition  the German 'angst' over energy prices and the overall economy impacted our sales in that key region. While we can't control the macroeconomic climate in which we operate  we can and do control how we invest for the growth of Hybrid Software Group. We're deeply committed to innovation on behalf of the industry  and we listen to our customers' requests to help shape our development planning. With limited growth forecasted for 2023  we invested in carefully selected areas to prepare for future growth.""CEO Mike Rottenborn adds  ""Wage inflation had a significant effect on staff cost  but careful cost management allowed us to deliver an adjusted net profit from continuing operations that was 137% higher than 2022. I expect to double our operating profit in 2024  as business activity is building within each of the segments  with an optimised cost structure in place and tailwinds from the Drupa show to be expected in the second and third quarter. Our Company vision  'The Heartbeat of Industrial Printing and Packaging'  is what drives the team at Hybrid Software Group every day. We partner with our customers and share their heartbeat as we work together to move our industry into the future. The last two years have been challenging but I'm excited by the prospects for 2024 and beyond.""Financial highlightsFor the year ended 31 December In thousands of euros 2023 2022 Restated Continuing operations Revenue 48 043 46 693 Operating (loss)/profit (1 161) 2 274 (Loss)/Profit before tax (1 667) 1 835 Tax credit/(charge) 2 986 (772) Profit from continuing operations 1 319 1 063 EBITDA - continuing operations 7 306 10 895 Adjusted operating profit - continuing operations 2 517 2 106 Adjusted net profit - continuing operations 1 676 708 Basic earnings per share (euro) - continuing operations 0.04 0.03 Adjusted net basic earnings per share (euro) - continuing operations 0.05 0.02 Available cash 7 079 6 317The consolidated pre-tax result for continuing operations was a loss of €1.67 million compared with a profit of €1.84 million in 2022. The decrease in profitability of €3.51 million is due to:an increase in revenue of €1.35 million;an increase in cost of sales of €1.28 million;an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses of €0.73 million;a decrease in research and development expenses of €0.34 million;no change in the other operating expenses;a decrease in other income of €3.11 million (the 2022 figure was favourably impacted by the sale of approx. 69 000 IPv4 addresses);a decrease in net finance expenses of €0.13 million; andan increase in foreign exchange losses of €0.21 million.Revenue for the Printing Software segment was €14.94 million for the year (2022: €15.26 million). During 2023 a new contract was agreed with an existing customer which resulted in €2.6 million of revenue being recognised (in 2022 a new contract was agreed with an existing customer which resulted in €1.6 million of revenue being recognised).Revenue for the Printhead Solutions segment was €11.30 million for the year (2022: €8.66 million). In 2022 revenue for this segment had been severely impacted by the shortage of its most commonly used chip. In 2023 it recovered significantly throughout the year.Revenue for the Enterprise Software segment was €21.81 million for the year (2022: €22.78 million). In 2023 a five-year licencing agreement with its largest customer ended  resulting in a decline of €3.2 million in licence revenues year-over-year. Additionally the segment experienced unfavourable business conditions in its two most important markets  the United States and Germany  leading to subpar results in these regions and for the segment as a whole. For the segment year-over-year licence royalty income declined by €2.9 million which was partly offset by an increase in maintenance and after-sale support services income (€1.49 million) and services income (€0.37 million).Gross profit for the period decreased to 82% of revenue (2022: 84.2%)  primarily due to the higher mix of printing electronics sales during the year  which have a lower level of gross margin that software because of their manufacturing costs.Included in selling  general and administrative expenses is amortisation of €0.97 million (2022: €1.17 million) related to intangible assets recognised as a result of acquisitions.Research and development expenses includes the capitalisation and amortisation of internally generated intangible assets and the amortisation of certain intangible assets recognised as a result of acquisitions. During the period there was a net capitalisation of development expenditure of €1.39 million (2022: €2.02 million) and amortisation of acquired intangible assets of €4.76 million (2022: €5.14 million).The net capitalisation of development expenditure comprised €3.82 million (2022: €4.0 million) of capitalised expenditure less €2.43 million (2022: €1.98 million) of amortisation.The third quarter of 2022 results were favourably impacted by the sale of an unused asset (approximately 69 000 IPv4 internet addresses) for a net amount of €3.3 million which closed in July 2022. Given the nature of the sale this income is reported as ""Other Income"" and is not included in our revenue figures  but it is accretive to EBITDA. No comparable transaction occurred in 2023.Total operating expenses increased by €0.4 million  or 0.96% compared to the same period in the prior year. The increase was mainly due to higher sales & marketing related expenditures and increased amortisation of intangible assets.Foreign exchange gains and losses are primarily due to the revaluation of currency balances held at the balance sheet date and the change in exchange rates during the year.The Company presents EBITDA (earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortisation) and adjusted profit when reporting its financial results to provide investors with an additional tool to evaluate the Group's results in a manner that focuses on what the Group believes to be its underlying business operations. The Group's management believes that the inclusion of adjusted financial results provides consistency and comparability with past reports.Additional commentary and analysis of the Company's consolidated results for the year ending 31 December 2023 can be found in the annual report and financial statements.Should you wish to receive a printed copy of the annual report  please send an e-mail to investor-relations@hybridsoftware.group or make your request in writing  for the attention of the Company's Chief Financial Officer  to 2030 Cambourne Business Park  Cambourne  Cambridge  CB23 6DW  UK.Annual General MeetingThe Company will hold its annual general meeting on Wednesday 8 May 2024.

This project known as AFTER-BIOCHEM  was granted in 2020 to a consortium of 12 partners led by AFYREN NEOXY. This consortium is working toward a common goal: creating sustainable value chains from renewable and non-food raw material and making bio-based chemical building blocks available at scale for industry. In addition to the production of acids  the project’s scope includes work on the downstream market  where the acids are used as building blocks for other products in markets including food and feed; flavors and fragrances; lubricants and technical fluids. The third grant instalment was approved after an independent panel of experts determined that the AFTER-BIOCHEM project had met a set of achievements.The 12 European project partners 4 SMEs : AFYREN NEOXY   PNO   SPHERA   TERRIAL:       7 large industries : CELANESE   SÜDZUCKER   FIRMENICH   SUEZ   KEMIN   TECHNIP ENERGIES   FIABILA:             1 Cluster: BIOECONOMY FOR CHANGEThe AFTER-BIOCHEM project will continue  with the support of CBE JU. A particular focus will be put on plant performance during production phase  including life cycle analysis and product performance analysis with end-user partners. Further developments such as plant replication and new products projects will also be assessed.With the latest payment  total support from CBE JU to AFTER-BIOCHEM reaches €16 million over the past four years  of which 90% was directly invested in AFYREN-NEOXY. These funds have contributed to all development phases of the plant: construction  commissioning and ramp-up. The factory represents an initial total CAPEX of around €62 million. The French state investment bank BPI has a 49% stake in AFYREN NEOXY.AFYREN NEOXY is expected to start continuous production of its biobased acids in 2024 and reach financial breakeven2 in 2025.Nicolas Sordet  CEO of AFYREN  commented: ""This latest instalment of funds and the continuation of the project  underscore the progress made by our partners and us toward our differentiated sustainable solutions. We are grateful for the CBE JU's excellent work turning European vision into reality  advancing the bio-based sector by helping rallying stakeholders around a common goal. As we prepare for a very active 2024  I'll take this opportunity to thank all our investors and supporters  public and private.""About AFTER-BIOCHEMAFTER-BIOCHEM is a unique opportunity to turn agricultural processing co-products into new product streams. The project core technology is based on 10 years of R&D at AFYREN. The technology can turn biomass into high added-value and natural products using its all-in-one cutting edge fermentation process based on natural micro-organisms (100% GMO-free process and products). The project will also implement a ""zero waste"" strategy based on an optimised production process; all the fermentation outputs are valorised into valuable products: seven organic acids and one mineral co-product that can be used respectively as ingredients and fertiliser. The bio-based and natural compounds will have applications in various markets such as food and feed  fragrances and flavors  personal care  pharmaceuticals  and industrial chemicals.About AFYRENAFYREN is a French greentech company launched in 2012 to meet the challenge of decarbonizing industrial ingredients. Its innovative  unique and proprietary fermentation technology valorizes local biomass from non-food agricultural co-products  replacing petro-sourced compounds used in many industrial product formulations.

This investigational multivalent protein subunit vaccine uses an established mechanism of action for a Lyme disease vaccine that targets the outer surface protein A (OspA) of Borrelia burgdorferi  the bacteria that cause Lyme disease. OspA is a surface protein expressed by the bacteria when present in a tick. Blocking OspA inhibits the bacterium’s ability to leave the tick and infect humans. The vaccine candidate covers the six most common OspA serotypes expressed by the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato species that are prevalent in North America and Europe. VLA15 is an alum-adjuvanted formulation  administered intramuscularly and has demonstrated a strong immune response as well as satisfactory safety profile in pre-clinical and clinical trials so far.About Valneva SEWe are a specialty vaccine company that develops  manufactures  and commercializes prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases addressing unmet medical needs.

The commitment of the two main shareholders to participate in this capital increase without discount  to maintain their existing positions and to carefully manage the PACEO should be seen as a guarantee of sound management and confidence in Adocia's short- and medium-term future.”Main characteristics of the Capital IncreaseThe Company's Chief Executive Officer  making use of the sub-delegation granted to him by the Board of Directors on March 08  2024  itself making use of the delegation granted to him by the General Meeting of Shareholders of the Company on May 11  2023 (the ""General Meeting"") under its 22nd resolution6  today decided to issue 207 683 new shares  on the basis of Article L. 225-138 of the French Commercial Code  with preferential subscription rights waived for Gérard Soula  Olivier Soula  a member of Adocia's management team and Vester Finance.In accordance with the 22nd resolution of the General Meeting  the Chief Executive Officer has set the subscription price for the new shares at €9.63  corresponding to the volume-weighted average share price for the three trading days preceding the setting of the issue price  without any discount.The new shares are due to be admitted to trading on the Euronext regulated market in Paris on March 25  2024. They will be listed on the same quotation line as the Company's existing shares (ISIN FR0011184241)  will carry dividend rights and will be immediately assimilated to the Company's existing shares.Main terms of the PACEOUnder the terms of the agreement signed on March 21  2024  Vester Finance has undertaken to subscribe for a maximum of 1 700 000 shares in the Company  representing up to 12.07% of the share capital  at its own initiative  over a maximum period of 24 months  subject to certain customary contractual conditions.New shares will be issued on the basis of the average market price preceding each issue7  reduced by a maximum discount of 5%  in accordance with the price and ceiling rules set by the General Meeting as per the 23rd resolution6  8. The subscription price will be paid in priority by offsetting receivables against the advance granted by Vester Finance. Vester Finance will receive a commission of 2.0% on the proceeds of the issue.The Company has undertaken to use a minimum of €2 million of the financing facility  corresponding  at the current share price  to a dilution of around 1.54%  beyond which the Company will have the option of suspending or terminating this agreement at any time and at no cost.This operation was decided by the Chief Executive Officer acting on a delegation of authority from the Company's Board of Directors in accordance with the 23rd resolution of the Annual General Meeting  in order to enable the issue of 547 740 shares  corresponding to the number of shares remaining available under the terms of the 23rd resolution of the Annual General Meeting9. At the next Annual General Meeting  shareholders will be asked to delegate their powers to the Company's Board of Directors to issue the remaining portion of the PACEO (representing a maximum of 1 152 260 shares) exclusively to Vester Finance. The Soula family will support this initiative.This equity financing line was structured and underwritten by Vester Finance  a European company that usually invests in small-cap growth companies  particularly in the healthcare and biotech sectors. Vester Finance  acting here as an investor  may be required to resell all or part of the shares subscribed under the PACEO at some point in the future.Assuming full utilization of this financing facility  a shareholder holding 1.00% of the Company's share capital before the facility was set up would see his stake fall to 0.892% of the share capital on a non-diluted basis10  and 0.894% of the share capital on a diluted basis11. Based on the current share price  the total amount of net financing would represent €15.1 million12.This transaction does not give rise to the preparation of a prospectus subject to the approval of the Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF)  on the basis of Article 1 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as amended (Prospectus Regulation)  granting an exemption when a transaction involves a dilution of less than 20% of the Company's share capital over a 12-month period.The number of shares issued under this agreement and admitted to trading will be disclosed on the Company's website.Theoretical impact of the Capital Increase and PACEOFollowing completion of the Capital Increase and the PACEO  the Company's share capital will amount to €1 599 761.30  divided into 15 997 613 ordinary shares with a par value of €0.10 each.Prior to the transaction  the Soula family group held 10.63% of the Company's capital and 16.38% of the voting rights  and Vester Finance 10.17% and 8.83% of the voting rights.After completion of the capital increase  the Soula family group will hold 10.95% and 16.58% of the voting rights and Vester Finance 10.74% and 9.35% of the voting rights.By way of illustration  a shareholder holding 1% of the Company's share capital before the Capital Increase (on a non-diluted basis) and who did not take part in the transaction will hold:- 0.985% of the Company's share capital after the Capital Increase;- 0.881% after the Capital Increase and assuming that the is PACEO fully used.Shareholder structure:Before the Capital Increase After the Capital Increase After the Capital Increase and the utilization of PACEO Nber of shares % of capital % of voting rights(1) Nber of shares % of capital % of voting rights(1) Nber of shares % of capital % of voting rights(1) Soula Family (2) 1 497 416 10 6% 16 4% 1 564 913 10 9% 16 6% 1 564 913 9 8% 15 0% Gérard Soula (*) 1 187 226 8 4% 12 6% 1 239 147 8 7% 12 7% 1 239 147 7 7% 11 5% Olivier Soula (*) 310 190 2 2% 3 8% 325 766 2 3% 3 9% 325 766 2 0% 3 5% Financial investors 2 508 847 17 8% 18 7% 2 612 689 18 3% 19 1% 2 612 689 16 3% 17 3% Vester Finance 1 432 432 10 2% 8 8% 1 536 274 10 7% 9 4% 1 536 274 9 6% 8 5% Innobio (a) 138 006 1 0% 1 7% 138 006 1 0% 1 7% 138 006 0 9% 1 5% FPS Bpifrance Innovation I (c) 550 660 3 9% 3 4% 550 660 3 9% 3 4% 550 660 3 4% 3 0% Sub-total Bpifrance (a)+(b)+(c) 688 666 4 9% 5 1% 688 666 4 8% 5 0% 688 666 4 3% 4 6% Fund Amundi 1 570 0 0% 0 0% 1 570 0 0% 0 0% 1 570 0 0% 0 0% Fund Viveris 25 618 0 2% 0 3% 25 618 0 2% 0 3% 25 618 0 2% 0 3% Oréo Finance 40 561 0 3% 0 5% 40 561 0 3% 0 5% 40 561 0 3% 0 4% SHAM (3) 320 000 2 3% 3 9% 320 000 2 2% 3 9% 320 000 2 0% 3 5% Employees 227 552 1 6% 2 0% 263 896 1 8% 2 2% 263 896 1 6% 2 0% Scientific Committee (BSA) 700 0 0% 0 0% 700 0 0% 0 0% 700 0 0% 0 0% Autocontrol (4) 6 474 0 0% 0 0% 6 474 0 0% 0 0% 6 474 0 0% 0 0% Other Shareholders (5) 9 848 941 69 9% 62 9% 9 848 941 68 9% 62 1% 11 548 941 72 2% 65 7% TOTAL 14 089 930 100 0% 100 0% 14 297 613 100 0% 100 0% 15 997 613 100 0% 100 0%* Directors of the CompanyAll fully paid-up shares (irrespective of class) registered in the name of the same shareholder for at least two years carry double voting rights in relation to the percentage of share capital they represent.

In recent months  we have demonstrated our operational excellence and our ability to execute on our roadmap  by starting our first production units in Spain  Canada and most recently in the United States. This fundraising will make it possible to finance new production units  particularly in the United States  a strategic market in which we have recorded numerous commercial successes in recent months. We will thus accelerate the creation of value for all our stakeholders  while fighting against global warming through the reduction of methane emissions and the production of biomethane.”Transaction rationale and use of proceedsWaga Energy is experiencing significant growth acceleration  notably in North America  and intends to use the net proceeds from the Offering to fund the equity portion of the capex investments in new projects and the pre-manufacturing and manufacturing of WAGABOX© units to deliver on its international expansion.With the net proceeds of the Offering  together with additional non-dilutive sources of financing  including corporate debt  the Company expects to finance the capex investments required to reach its 2026 revenue objective of €200 million[1].Final terms of the OfferingGross proceeds from the Offering amount to €52 million  and net proceeds amount to approximately €50.2 million. 3 939 394 New Shares will be issued  representing c. 19.2% of the Company’s existing share capital before Offering.

By way of illustration  a shareholder holding 1% of the share capital prior to the Offering and which did not participate in the Offering will hold 0.8% after completion of the Offering.Settlement and delivery of the New Shares and their admission to trading on the regulated market of Euronext Paris is expected to occur on March 25  2024.

Most of our resources were focused on the transition to the Company's new business model to direct sales  aimed at ensuring its commercial autonomy. With 58% of order intake placed through direct sales in 2023  BALYO is close to achieving the 65% target announced a year ago. Another highlight over the past year was the search for financing to secure the Company's development. As part of this process  BALYO welcomed SoftBank Group as its majority shareholder. BALYO has also just obtained from his majority shareholder a €12 million shareholder loan in March 2024  extending its financial visibility. The year 2024 should thus enable BALYO to pursue its commercial ambitions  driven by growth in direct sales  while maintaining very tight control over its costs in order to preserve its cash position.”2023 financial results*In €m 2023 2022 Change Sales revenue 26.67 24.14 +10% Cost of sales -17.38 -13.79 +26% Gross margin 9.28 10.35 -10% Gross margin rate 35% 43% -19% Research and Development -4.35 -4.55 -4% Sales and Marketing -2.99 -2 91 +3% General and administrative expenses -7.12 -7 12 - Share-based payment expense -0.11 -0.24 -54% Other non-current operating income and expenses -2.71 - - Operating income -8.00 -4.45 -80% Financial expense -1.73 -0.11 n.s. Net income -9.76 -4.56 -114% Cash position as of December 31st 8.6 8.2* The audit procedures have been carried out by the Statutory Auditor’s and the corresponding report is about to be issued.In 2023  BALYO recorded an increase in sales by +10% to €26.7 million. This growth was driven by the recovery in business in APAC (+426%) and sales growth in the United States (+17%).Regarding sales momentum  2023 order intake rose by +39%  reaching €36.1 million. BALYO signed a significant order worth $7.8 million in the United States in the fourth quarter  leading to a strong rebound in 2023 order intake. Overall  58% of the 2023 order intake was placed through direct sales orders  compared with 37% in 2022.The backlog stands at €21.9 million as of December 31  2023  up by 73% over the year  with substantial growth both in the United States and the APAC region.Over the course of the 2023 financial year  cost of sales increased by €3.6 million to €17.4 million. With this increase  gross margin amounted to €9.3 million  compared with €10.3 million in 2022. The 2023 gross margin rate dropped to 35%  compared with 43% in 2022. The increase of cost is on the one hand linked to the change in sales model (project sales including base trucks) and on the other hand related to higher-than-expected execution cost partly due to subcontracting.Operating expenses amounted to €17.3 million  up 17% compared with 2022. Current operating expenses (R&D  Sales and Marketing  G&A) remained stable  demonstrating BALYO's ability to control its cost structure. However  the Company recorded other non-recurring operating income and expenses totaling €2.7 million  partly related to SoftBank Group's takeover bid for BALYO shares.After taking these items into account  operating loss was -€8.0 million  compared with -€4.5 million in 2022. In total  and after including the financial income of -€1.7 million  net loss set at -€9.8 million for 2023.At the end of December 2023  BALYO had 169 employees  compared with 146 employees as of December 31  2022.Financial position and outlookAs of December 31  2023  BALYO’s cash position stood at €8.6 million. Following the agreement reached in June 2023 with its senior creditors regarding the extension of existing financing  for which the Company was unable to meet upcoming payment deadlines  BALYO ultimately obtained a payment exemption until December 31  2023.In order to extend its financial visibility  BALYO has entered into a Shareholder Loan Agreement with SoftBank Group Corp.  its majority shareholder  for a total amount of up to €12 million. The terms and conditions of such shareholder loan  which are further described in the notice published on BALYO's website2  have been approved by the Board of Directors on March 18  2024.Given its cash position at the date of this press release and after taking into account the remaining convertible bonds issuances with SoftBank Group (pursuant to the fulfilment of the required conditions)  the postponement of payment deadlines to 2024 granted to BALYO by one of its main suppliers  the record of a $7.8 million order intake  which generated a down payment of 50% of this amount end of 2023  and the shareholder loan up to €12 million granted by SoftBank Group Corp. to the Company (subject to certain covenants and which may be repaid by offsetting of receivables as part of a capital increase)  BALYO is now confident in the funding of its activities.Next BALYO financial announcement: first quarter 2024 sales revenue  on April 23  2024 after market closing.About BALYOHumans around the World deserve enriching and creative jobs.

The Board recommends that the shareholders vote FOR Proposal 3. 4PROPOSAL 4 - TO APPROVE AMENDMENTS TO BYE-LAWS The current Bye-laws reflect the Company's position as it underwent and emerged from its reorganization under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code (the ""Chapter 11 process""). It is the view of the Board that the Company's position has changed significantly since February 22  2022  being the date on which the Company emerged from the Chapter 11 process. Moreover  since October 14  2022  the Company's common shares have been listed and traded principally on the New York Stock Exchange (""NYSE"") and the Company is now subject to the NYSE's listing requirements. To best position the Company to deliver sustainable long-term performance in a competitive and volatile market  the Board recommends that the Bye-laws be amended and restated to read in their entirety as set forth in Appendix 2 attached to this Proxy Statement (the ""A&R Bye-laws""). The Board believes that the A&R Bye-laws are consistent with good corporate governance and will better align the Company with market practices among U.S. listed companies  and investor expectations. Specifically  the Board believes the refinements will  among other things  eliminate unnecessary provisions related to the Chapter 11 process and the tax position of the Company upon emergence from the Chapter 11 process  increase the flexibility the Board to promptly and effectively oversee the business and affairs of the Company for the benefit of the greater shareholder group  permit the Board to take decisions that are appropriately within the authority of the Board and establish clear procedures for the engagement by our shareholders in making shareholder proposals at general meetings of shareholders. To assist the shareholders in considering this Proposal  a comparative table of the proposed amendments vis-à-vis the current Bye-law provisions is included as Appendix 1 attached to this Proxy Statement and a complete copy of the A&R Bye-laws is included as Appendix 2 attached to this Proxy Statement. In certain cases  the proposed amendments to the Bye-laws would give the Board greater authority vis-à-vis shareholders in making certain decisions for the Company. Therefore  you should read carefully the information provided in this Proxy Statement before voting on this Proposal. Shareholder Outreach Efforts and Engagement of Proxy Advisory Services In March 2023  we held the first annual general meeting of our shareholders (the ""2022 AGM"") after our emergence from the Chapter 11 process. At the 2022 AGM  we originally intended to seek the approval of our shareholders of an amendment and restatement of our Bye-laws  which Bye-laws had been negotiated with our creditors prior to our emergence from the Chapter 11 process. Before the 2022 AGM  some shareholders expressed concern about certain aspects of the proposed changes to the Bye-laws. Therefore  the Board withdrew the proposed changes to the Bye-laws from consideration by shareholders at the 2022 AGM. Since then  the Company has considered appropriate changes to the Bye-laws to address the shareholder feedback  eliminate provisions that resulted from the negotiation with our creditors and were not customary for publicly traded companies and better align the Bye-laws with market practices among U.S. listed companies in light of the Company's shares being principally traded on the NYSE. In proposing certain changes to the Bye-laws  the Company considered how it does not benefit from the typical Bye-law provisions of Delaware companies (such as interested shareholder and fair price provisions) that provide shareholders with certain protections in the context of a potential company takeover  including a hostile takeover. As a result  the Company seeks to provide the Board with certain tools  such as the authorized preference shares and supermajority vote requirement to approve certain mergers  as described below. In January 2024  the Company engaged a consulting firm familiar with the practices of shareholder advisory services  such as Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. (""ISS"")  to review the proposed amendments to the Bye-laws. Such a review included an analysis of ISS standards for various regions  including the United States  where we maintain our primary stock exchange listing  and Continental Europe. We believe that ISS will assess the proposed amendments to the Bye-laws based on whether they comply with its Continental Europe policy due to our status as a foreign private issuer under U.S. securities laws. However  because the Company's shares are principally traded on the NYSE and because we are moving our headquarters to Houston  Texas  we believe that assessment by ISS under the U.S. policy would be more appropriate and meaningful to our shareholders. We believe certain of the proposed amendments to the Bye-laws would be viewed favorably by ISS if it were to apply its U.S. policy  while some of the proposed amendments  such as the amendment providing for authorized preference shares and the amendment providing for a supermajority vote requirement to approve certain mergers  would likely not be supported by ISS. Nonetheless  the below discussion provides additional detail on why we believe these proposed changes are in the Company's best interest. 5Authorized Preference Shares The Company has no current plans to issue any preference shares. However  the A&R Bye-laws would authorize the Board to issue up to 5 000 000 preference shares with such designation  powers  preferences and rights as determined by the Board  without further shareholder action. Currently  the Company has an authorized share capital of $3 750 000 consisting of 375 000 000 shares of par value $0.01 per share  all of which are designated as common shares. The Bye-laws currently do not authorize the issuance of any preference shares. The Board believes that the availability of authorized and undesignated preference shares will provide the Company with greater flexibility to issue additional capital in the form of preference shares should conditions warrant and  importantly  could provide our Board with a useful tool in connection with a potential takeover of the Company. Given the absence of typical Delaware interested shareholder provisions that could provide protection of shareholders in the face of a hostile takeover  the Board believes that enabling the Company to issue such preference shares upon Board action would be in the best interests of the Company. The Board could use preference shares in connection with a shareholder rights plan. The adoption of such a plan would incentivize a potential acquiror to negotiate the terms of any potential takeover of the Company with the Board. The Board believes that it is best- positioned to determine an appropriate value of the Company and negotiate that value with a potential acquiror. The Board believes that this preference share provision  together with the supermajority voting requirement also included in the proposed amendments to the Bye-laws and discussed below  would create a similar dynamic to that which would be available to a U.S. corporation having authorized preference shares and an interested shareholder provision similar to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law. To mitigate a potential negative reaction from our shareholders and an adverse recommendation by ISS  the Board has committed that the Company will not utilize the preference shares in a shareholder rights plan that has a term of more than one year without submitting any such rights plan to shareholders for approval. If Proposal 4 is approved  the Company may utilize preference shares without shareholder approval for the defensive purposes described above  as well as for general corporate purposes  including  without limitation  general capital raising to support organic growth  capital raising to support merger and acquisition opportunities  the issuance of share dividends or share splits and other general corporate purposes. As noted above  the Board has no current plans to issue any preference shares. Advance Notice Provisions Our Bye-laws already include requirements regarding the advance notice that shareholders must provide in order to propose director nominations at a meeting of shareholders. The A&R Bye-laws provide for such requirements to also apply for shareholders to propose business other than director nominations at a meeting of shareholders. The Board believes that extending these ""advance notice"" provisions to all shareholder proposals is more in line with U.S. public company standards and would allow the Company and shareholders to receive relevant information regarding any shareholder proposal. Change in Board Size The A&R Bye-laws allow the Board to determine the size of the Board within a range of not less than five and not more than eleven directors. This amendment provides the Board with flexibility to accommodate changes in Board size within a specified range  and such a provision is common among U.S. public companies. All directors remain subject to annual election by shareholders  and shareholders retain the right to remove any director with or without cause. In addition  the Board believes that the specified range for the Board size is reasonable. 6Director Independence The A&R Bye-laws remove the existing requirement that alldirectors shall be independent at all times. Most public companies do not have such a restriction. The existing requirement limits the flexibility of the Company by preventing the CEO or person who is not independent within SEC and NYSE rules from serving on the Board and requiring any sitting director who for whatever reason is no longer independent to be removed from the Board. In certain circumstances  it may be desirable to keep such a director on the Board. In addition  the existing requirement is more restrictive than the requirements of the SEC and the NYSE. The Company is subject to  and will continue to be subject to  the requirements of the SEC and the NYSE that require a majority of directors and all members of the Audit and Risk Committee and the Joint Nomination and Remuneration Committee to be independent. Remuneration of Directors The A&R Bye-laws allow the Board to determine the remuneration of directors. The Company's shares are principally traded on the NYSE  and therefore the Company believes that a more traditional structure among U.S. public companies where the Board determines director compensation is more appropriate. The Board believes this amendment better aligns the Company with U.S. market practice. CEO as Member of the Board The A&R Bye-laws remove the existing impediments (including the requirement on independence of all directors as discussed above) to the CEO serving as a director. The existing Bye-law limits the flexibility of the Company and is unusual among U.S. public companies. If the Board determines that it is appropriate for the CEO to serve on the Board  the Board believes it should have the flexibility to nominate the CEO as a director for consideration by the shareholders. The Board has not nominated the CEO for election to the Board at the Meeting. In addition  the roles of CEO and Chair of the Board of the Company are currently filled by two different individuals. The Board intends to maintain this structure even if the CEO of the Company is elected to the Board. Supermajority Vote Requirement to Approve Certain Mergers As noted above  the Bye-laws do not provide for supermajority approval of a takeover of the Company by an ""insider"" as would not be uncommon for U.S. companies formed under the laws of Delaware. The A&R Bye-laws provide for a bifurcated vote standard for shareholder approval of mergers  with a simple majority vote being required for mergers that are approved by the Board and a two-thirds vote being required for mergers that are not approved by the Board. We believe that a higher vote standard is appropriate for transactions that the Board has not approved  as it incentivizes potential acquirers to negotiate directly with the Board  which is better-positioned to negotiate on behalf of the Company and all its shareholders. At the Meeting  the Board will ask the shareholders to approve the A&R Bye-laws as set out in Appendix 2 attached to this Proxy Statement and adopt the A&R Bye-laws to be the bye-laws of the Company in substitution for and to the exclusion of all existing bye-laws of the Company. The Board recommends that the shareholders vote FOR Proposal 4. 7PROPOSAL 5 - TO APPROVE THE REMUNERATION OF DIRECTORS In connection with the Company's Chapter 11 process  certain significant creditors of the Company (who became shareholders of the Company upon the Company's emergence from the Chapter 11 process) approved the remuneration that would be paid to the Directors who were appointed to the Board upon emergence of the Company from the Chapter 11 process (the ""Initial Directors""). All of our current Directors  except Ms. Zambelli and Messrs. Quarls and Swinney  were Initial Directors and  therefore  entered into services agreements with the Company providing for such remuneration. All of our Directors were paid the basic meeting fees provided for in such services agreements from our emergence from Chapter 11  including during 2023 (within the aggregate amount approved by shareholders at our 2022 AGM) and to date in 2024. In addition  as described in our proxy materials relating to the 2022 AGM  the six directors who were Initial Directors were entitled to receive under their services agreements a fee referred to in such agreements as an ""Incentive Fee."" In accordance with the services agreements  those fees became due and were paid to the six Initial Directors promptly following the second-year anniversary of the date of our emergence from the Chapter 11 process (i.e.  February 22  2024). Information regarding the remuneration paid to Directors from January 1  2024 to the date of the Meeting  which includes the Incentive Fees paid to the Initial Directors (the ""Interim Remuneration"")  is included in Part 1 of the recommendation of the Joint Remuneration and Nomination Committees set out in Appendix 3  as attached to this Proxy Statement (the ""Recommendation""). The Board is asking shareholders to ratify this compensation in accordance with the Bye-laws. As required under the Bye-laws  the Joint Nomination and Remuneration Committee of the Board has recommended to the Board that Directors of the Company receive a certain level of remuneration in respect of their service on the Board for the period from the date immediately following the Meeting until the later to occur of December 31  2024 and the date of the 2025 Annual General Meeting of Shareholders (the ""Prospective Remuneration"")  information regarding which is included in Part 2 of the Recommendation. In accordance with the Bye-laws  the recommendation for such Board remuneration must be approved by shareholders. At the Meeting  the Board will ask the shareholders to (i) ratify  approve and confirm the Interim Remuneration and (ii) approve the Prospective Remuneration  in each case  as set out in the Recommendation in Appendix 3 attached to this Proxy Statement. The Board recommends that the shareholders vote FOR Proposal 5. PROPOSAL 6 - TO APPROVE THE DELISTING OF COMMON SHARES FROM THE OSLO STOCK EXCHANGE On April 28  2022  the Company completed a listing of its common shares on the Euronext Expand (the ""Euronext Expand"") market of the Oslo Stock Exchange (the ""OSE""). On October 11  2022  the Company listed its common shares on the NYSE under the ticker symbol ""SDRL"" and the common shares commenced trading on the NYSE on October 14  2022. Following the listing on the NYSE  the status of the Company's listing on the Euronext Expand market of the OSE was changed from a primary to a secondary listing. On November 17  2022  the common shares were moved from the Euronext Expand market to the main list of the OSE. The substantial majority of the daily trading volume of the common shares of the Company is now conducted on the NYSE. The Board believes that delisting will eliminate regulatory duplication  complexities  and costs associated with administering a dual-listing regime  consistent with continued corporate efforts to simplify the business. For that reason  the Board recommends that the common shares be delisted from the OSE and that the shareholders approve that an application is made by the Company to the OSE for the delisting of its common shares (the ""Delisting""). Although the Delisting would eliminate OSE regulation of the Company and its public disclosure and governance (such as OSE prospectus publication requirements related to new share issuances)  the Board believes that the NYSE listing regime and SEC rules will sufficiently protect the interest of our shareholders. Moreover  in connection with the Company recently moving its corporate headquarters to the United States  the status of the Company as a foreign private issuer under U.S. securities laws (and NYSE rules) should cease at the end of 2024  thereby resulting in greater regulation under NYSE and SEC rules of the Company's disclosure and governance obligations. 8",neutral,0.02,0.98,0.01,neutral,0.05,0.92,0.03,True,English,"['2024 AGM Proxy Statement', 'Seadrill', 'March', 'full corporate, limited liability company', 'share voting cutoff time', 'Seadrill Chief Executive Officer', 'PROXY STATEMENT INFORMATION CONCERNING', 'Ms. Julie Robertson', 'Mr. Simon Johnson', 'Mr. Martyn Svensen', 'Ms. Jennifer Panchaud', '51 Mercedes Way Edgewood', 'P.O.

With its position in a fast-growing market at the heart of sustainable transport infrastructure  a solid financial structure and long-term partners and investors  the group is well positioned to pursue its growth » remarked Fabrice and Raphaël Walewski  Touax SCA’s managing partners.Consolidated EBITDA at end-December 2023 amounts to €55.3 million  a -€2.6 million decrease  due to a slight contraction in business volumes (decrease of restated revenues from activities by -€4.3 million). The group share of net profit amounts to €3.6 million (vs. €7.5 million in 2022)  mainly impacted by the lower contribution of the container business and the increase in financial expenses due to higher interest rates (-€5.6 million).In 2023 TOUAX SCA completed two financing operations (Euro PP bond and banking club deal)  totalling €45 million and extending the debt maturity to 2027.The net book value per share is €10.97. Based on the market value of the assets  the revalued NAV1 per share came to €20.59  as of December 31  2023.At the Annual General Meeting  the managing partners will propose a dividend of 12 cents per share (corresponding to c.25% of net profit for the year)  up 20% on last year.The consolidated financial statements for the period ended December 31  2023  were approved by the Management Board on March 20  2024  and were submitted to the Supervisory Board on March 21  2024. The auditing of these statements is underway.KEY ACCOUNTING ITEMSKey figures 20232022(in € million) Restated Revenue(*) from activities 157.1 161.5 Of which Freight railcars 58.3 56.1 Of which River barges 15.0 17.5 Of which Containers 66.9 81.4 Of which Miscellaneous and eliminations 16.9 6.4 EBITDA 55.3 57.9 Operating income 28.3 31.1 Financial result -21.0 -15.4 Profit before taxes 7.3 15.7 Corporate tax -1.5 -6.3 Consolidated net profit (loss) (Group’s share) 3.6 7.5 Earnings per share (€) 0.52 1.07 Total non-current assets 406.3 394.6 Total assets 563.4 571.7 Total shareholders’ equity 147.6 153.7 Net financial debt (a) 285.7 273.0 Operating cash flow (b) 21.1 -1.5 Loan to Value ratio (c) 59.1% 59.5% (a) including €231.8m in debt without recourse at 31 Dec. 2023.

As such  no distinction is made in third-party management  which is presented solely in agent form.This presentation has no impact on EBITDA  operating income  or net income. The accounting presentation of revenue from activities is presented in the appendix to the press release.A SLIGHT DECLINE IN RESTATED REVENUE FROM ACTIVITES AS THE CONTAINER MARKET NORMALISESRestated revenue from activities over 2023 totalled €157.1 million (€159.6 million at constant scope and currency)  down by -2.7% compared with 2022 (-1.2% at constant scope and currency).The owned activity  which came to €147.9 million at the end of 2023  is down by -€2.6 million.The leasing revenues continue to grow over the year (+€3.9 million; +5.8%) confirming their recurring contribution to group revenues. The freight railcar (88.7%)  river barge (100%) and container (95.1%) average utilisation rates were at a high level in 2023.Ancillary services declined by -€4.9 million  impacted by the normalisation of container pick-up charges related to the container sales activity  and by the lower chartering activity on the Rhine basin (whose impact on the profitability is limited).Sales of owned equipment also declined by -€1.6 million (-2.7%)  with a significant drop in sales of owned containers (-€11 million) but partly offset by sales within Modular Buildings activity.The management activity amounts to €9.2 million with a decrease of -€1.7 million over the year  impacted by lower syndication volumes but partially compensated by commissions on the sale of investor equipment.ANALYSIS OF CONTRIBUTION BY DIVISIONThe restated revenue from the Freight Railcars division reached €58.3 million in 2023  an increase of +€2.0 million (+3.8%).Leasing income rose by +6% (+€3.1 million) to €55.3 million over the year  supported by an average utilisation rate rising to 88.7% in 2023 (87.6% in 2022) and with new asset acquisition generating additional revenue. Sales of owned equipment decreased by -€1.1 million.The restated revenue from the River Barges division is down by -€2.4 million to €15 million  impacted by the lower chartering activity on the Rhine basin after the dynamism of 2022 (-€2.9 million). The leasing revenue is up by +6% (+€0.4 million) taking advantage from investments made in Europe in 2022 and the full invoicing of barge rentals in South America in 2023.The restated revenue from the Containers division came to €66.9 million at the end of December 2023  a decrease of -€14.5 million (-17.8%) due to the normalisation of the sector after two exceptional years in 2021 and 2022.This change is mainly due to the decline of revenue from the sale of new containers (-€11 million for sales of owned equipment and -€2.8 million for ancillary services)  with a fall in price in 2023. However  the leasing revenue took advantage of recurrent investments and increases by +€1.2 million.The management activity is down by -€1.9 million  with a fall in syndication fees (-€1.4 million) and management fees (-€0.9 million  due to the decline in the fleet). Meanwhile  commissions on sales of investor equipment rose by +€0.4 million.Revenue from the Modular Buildings division presented under ""Miscellaneous” strongly increased in 2023 to €16.9 million (+€10.5 million) with more orders delivered following the end of the Covid crisis.A PROFITABILITY MAINLY IMPACTED BY THE RISING OF INTEREST RATESEBITDA came to €55.3 million  a decrease of -€2.6 million (-4.5%).EBITDA in the Freight Railcars division rose to €31.4 million (+3%) compared with €30.6 million in 2022  supported by higher leasing revenue. However  the operating expenses are also higher due to the +€0.9 million increase in maintenance and repair costs.The River Barges division posted an EBITDA of €5.3 million over the year  giving a slight increase of +€0.3 million (+6%).EBITDA in the Containers division fell by a substantial -€7.6 million to €15.2 million (-33%) with the contraction of container sales.This unfavourable trend was partially offset by the recovery in sales for the Modular Buildings division.The group’s depreciation and amortization increased by +€2.6 million with the new investments made in 2022 and 2023.Operating income reached €28.3million  down by -€2.8 million compared with 2022  after taking into account the net exceptional income of €2.4 million (linked on the one hand to accounting income of €3.5 million relating to the purchase in January 2023 of minority interests in the Modular Buildings business in Africa  and on the other hand to a $1.0 million conviction in the United States for the former subsidiary of Modular Buildings for an old dispute).Financial income came to -€21 million  compared with -€15.4 million in 2022. The increase in net interest expense is 85% explained by the interest rate rising  partially offset by hedging in place. As the net debt only slightly increases  the volume effect is limited on the financial income.Corporate income tax amounted to -€1.5million  +€4.8 million compared with 2022 when an exceptional tax provision of €3.8 million was accounted (no cash impact) in the Containers division.Net income Group share amounted to €3.6 million (compared with €7.5 million in 2022)  mainly explained by the increase of interest rates  while our diversified business model limits cycle impacts of our activities.A BALANCED FINANCIAL STRUCTUREThe strength of the TOUAX’s balance sheet is reflected in the Loan to Value ratio of 59.1% as of end-December 2023  compared with 59.5% in 2022.The financial structure has been reinforced by the debt refinancing carried out by the parent company Touax SCA  providing greater certainty over the debt profile until mid-2027 (EuroPP issuance of €5.4 million and implementation of a club-deal bank financing of €40 million).Shareholders' equity amounts to €147.6 million  compared with 153.7 million euros at the end of December 2022.At the group level  the allocation of the full-year profit of €3.6 million was offset by distributions (dividend and payment to general partners) totalling -€1.5 million  by a negative change in reserves mainly due to translation adjustments and decrease in hedge value amounting to -€5.2 million  and by a -€1.7 million reduction in minority interests in the Freight Railcars business.The level of cash on the balance sheet at 31 December 2023 remains comfortable  at €39.0 million.FAVOURABLE OUTLOOK AT THE HEART OF SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORT INFRASTRUCTUREIn the short term TOUAX remains cautious with the current economic challenges: uneven growth by geographical area  high interest rates  major geopolitical risks.Despite turbulences  trade volumes remain at a satisfactory level 2. The year-end utilisation rates (88% for freight railcars  100% for river barges and 97% for containers) demonstrate the resilience of the economies and markets where the group operates.In an uncertain environment  the flexibility provided by our leasing solutions is sought by our clients and creates investment opportunities.The requirement for fleet renewal and fleet modernization remain important  particularly as part of our customers objectives for reducing CO 2 emissions. With its expertise in the intermodal  rail and river transport sectors  TOUAX benefits from a unique position at the heart of sustainable transport infrastructure  and increases its commitment to Corporate and Social Responsibility  for a low-carbon economy.The strengthening of TOUAX's CSR commitment has been confirmed by the increase in its extra-financial ratings. TOUAX was awarded the EcoVadis3 2023 Gold Medal (72/100) and now belongs to the top 5% of companies in all sectors.On the asset management business for third-party investors  committed funds from infrastructure funds (available in 2024) have reached €134 million and will support TOUAX’s growth.UPCOMING EVENTSMarch 22  2024: Video conference call to present the annual results in English May 15  2024: Q1 2024 revenue from activitiesJune 12  2024: Annual General MeetingTOUAX Group leases out tangible assets (freight railcars  river barges and containers) on a daily basis worldwide  both on its own account and for investors.

This market value is substituted for the net book value when calculating the net asset value.2 Clarkson forecasts January 2024: +5.5% (including 2% related to Red Sea re-routing) in percentage of containerised traffic (TEU-miles) vs. +1.6% in 20233 EcoVadis: evaluation of the main CSR impacts according to four themes: Environment  Social & Human Rights  Ethics and Responsible PurchasingAttachment",neutral,0.01,0.98,0.01,mixed,0.3,0.38,0.32,True,English,"['Touax', '2023 RESULTS', 'March', '12:45', 'consolidated gross financial debt', 'The Net financial debt', 'rising interest rates', 'two exceptional years', 'solid financial structure', 'Raphaël Walewski', 'higher interest rates', 'two financing operations', 'Euro PP bond', 'banking club deal', 'Annual General Meeting', 'average utilisation rates', 'OPERATIONAL LEASING SOLUTION', 'sustainable transport infrastructure', 'Total shareholders’ equity', 'Operating cash flow', 'container pick-up charges', 'IFRS income statement', 'intangible fixed assets', 'lower syndication volumes', 'PRESS RELEASE Paris', 'consolidated financial statements', 'lower chartering activity', 'net book value', 'KEY ACCOUNTING ITEMS', 'resilient business model', 'Total non-current assets', 'Consolidated net profit', 'net equipment acquisitions', 'CONTAINER MARKET NORMALISES', 'Modular Buildings activity', 'container sales activity', 'financial expenses', 'Financial result', 'net income', 'business volumes', 'Total assets', 'lower contribution', 'debt maturity', 'debt derivatives', 'Operating income', 'SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORTATION', 'container business', 'market value', 'Key figures', 'key indicators', 'activity report', 'management activity', 'Consolidated EBITDA', 'leasing revenues', 'growing market', 'containerised traffic', 'freight railcars', 'international network', 'economic cycles', 'long-term partners', 'managing partners', 'slight contraction', 'Management Board', 'Supervisory Board', 'Corporate tax', 'less goodwill', 'third-party management', 'agent form', 'accounting presentation', 'SLIGHT DECLINE', 'constant scope', 'recurring contribution', 'high level', 'Ancillary services', 'Rhine basin', 'significant drop', 'Value ratio', 'river barges', 'Touax SCA', 'growth opportunities', '€2.6 million decrease', 'other activities', 'activities’ performance', 'Limited impact', 'last year', 'group revenues', 'Group share', 'Restated Revenue', '21 March', '17 h', '2023 RESULTS', 'profitable', 'context', 'normalisation', 'resilience', 'stability', 'quality', 'diversification', 'position', 'heart', 'investors', 'Fabrice', 'end-December', 'increase', 'NAV1', 'dividend', '12 cents', 'period', 'auditing', 'Containers', 'Miscellaneous', 'eliminations', 'taxes', 'loss', 'Earnings', '1.5 Loan', 'recourse', '31 Dec.', 'understanding', 'distinction', 'appendix', 'ACTIVITES', 'currency', 'profitability', '2021', '9', '1.1']",2024-03-21,2024-03-22,marketscreener.com

With its position in a fast-growing market at the heart of sustainable transport infrastructure  a solid financial structure and long-term partners and investors  the group is well positioned to pursue its growth » remarked Fabrice and Raphaël Walewski  Touax SCA’s managing partners.Consolidated EBITDA at end-December 2023 amounts to €55.3 million  a -€2.6 million decrease  due to a slight contraction in business volumes (decrease of restated revenues from activities by -€4.3 million). The group share of net profit amounts to €3.6 million (vs. €7.5 million in 2022)  mainly impacted by the lower contribution of the container business and the increase in financial expenses due to higher interest rates (-€5.6 million).In 2023 TOUAX SCA completed two financing operations (Euro PP bond and banking club deal)  totalling €45 million and extending the debt maturity to 2027.The net book value per share is €10.97. Based on the market value of the assets  the revalued NAV1 per share came to €20.59  as of December 31  2023.At the Annual General Meeting  the managing partners will propose a dividend of 12 cents per share (corresponding to c.25% of net profit for the year)  up 20% on last year.The consolidated financial statements for the period ended December 31  2023  were approved by the Management Board on March 20  2024  and were submitted to the Supervisory Board on March 21  2024. The auditing of these statements is underway.KEY ACCOUNTING ITEMSKey figures 20232022(in € million) Restated Revenue(*) from activities 157.1 161.5 Of which Freight railcars 58.3 56.1 Of which River barges 15.0 17.5 Of which Containers 66.9 81.4 Of which Miscellaneous and eliminations 16.9 6.4 EBITDA 55.3 57.9 Operating income 28.3 31.1 Financial result -21.0 -15.4 Profit before taxes 7.3 15.7 Corporate tax -1.5 -6.3 Consolidated net profit (loss) (Group’s share) 3.6 7.5 Earnings per share (€) 0.52 1.07 Total non-current assets 406.3 394.6 Total assets 563.4 571.7 Total shareholders’ equity 147.6 153.7 Net financial debt (a) 285.7 273.0 Operating cash flow (b) 21.1 -1.5 Loan to Value ratio (c) 59.1% 59.5% (a) including €231.8m in debt without recourse at 31 Dec. 2023.

The accounting presentation of revenue from activities is presented in the appendix to the press release.A SLIGHT DECLINE IN RESTATED REVENUE FROM ACTIVITES AS THE CONTAINER MARKET NORMALISESRestated revenue from activities over 2023 totalled €157.1 million (€159.6 million at constant scope and currency)  down by -2.7% compared with 2022 (-1.2% at constant scope and currency).The owned activity  which came to €147.9 million at the end of 2023  is down by -€2.6 million.The leasing revenues continue to grow over the year (+€3.9 million; +5.8%) confirming their recurring contribution to group revenues. The freight railcar (88.7%)  river barge (100%) and container (95.1%) average utilisation rates were at a high level in 2023.Ancillary services declined by -€4.9 million  impacted by the normalisation of container pick-up charges related to the container sales activity  and by the lower chartering activity on the Rhine basin (whose impact on the profitability is limited).Sales of owned equipment also declined by -€1.6 million (-2.7%)  with a significant drop in sales of owned containers (-€11 million) but partly offset by sales within Modular Buildings activity.The management activity amounts to €9.2 million with a decrease of -€1.7 million over the year  impacted by lower syndication volumes but partially compensated by commissions on the sale of investor equipment.ANALYSIS OF CONTRIBUTION BY DIVISIONThe restated revenue from the Freight Railcars division reached €58.3 million in 2023  an increase of +€2.0 million (+3.8%).Leasing income rose by +6% (+€3.1 million) to €55.3 million over the year  supported by an average utilisation rate rising to 88.7% in 2023 (87.6% in 2022) and with new asset acquisition generating additional revenue. Sales of owned equipment decreased by -€1.1 million.The restated revenue from the River Barges division is down by -€2.4 million to €15 million  impacted by the lower chartering activity on the Rhine basin after the dynamism of 2022 (-€2.9 million). The leasing revenue is up by +6% (+€0.4 million) taking advantage from investments made in Europe in 2022 and the full invoicing of barge rentals in South America in 2023.The restated revenue from the Containers division came to €66.9 million at the end of December 2023  a decrease of -€14.5 million (-17.8%) due to the normalisation of the sector after two exceptional years in 2021 and 2022.This change is mainly due to the decline of revenue from the sale of new containers (-€11 million for sales of owned equipment and -€2.8 million for ancillary services)  with a fall in price in 2023. However  the leasing revenue took advantage of recurrent investments and increases by +€1.2 million.The management activity is down by -€1.9 million  with a fall in syndication fees (-€1.4 million) and management fees (-€0.9 million  due to the decline in the fleet). Meanwhile  commissions on sales of investor equipment rose by +€0.4 million.Revenue from the Modular Buildings division presented under ""Miscellaneous” strongly increased in 2023 to €16.9 million (+€10.5 million) with more orders delivered following the end of the Covid crisis.A PROFITABILITY MAINLY IMPACTED BY THE RISING OF INTEREST RATESEBITDA came to €55.3 million  a decrease of -€2.6 million (-4.5%).EBITDA in the Freight Railcars division rose to €31.4 million (+3%) compared with €30.6 million in 2022  supported by higher leasing revenue. However  the operating expenses are also higher due to the +€0.9 million increase in maintenance and repair costs.The River Barges division posted an EBITDA of €5.3 million over the year  giving a slight increase of +€0.3 million (+6%).EBITDA in the Containers division fell by a substantial -€7.6 million to €15.2 million (-33%) with the contraction of container sales.This unfavourable trend was partially offset by the recovery in sales for the Modular Buildings division.The group’s depreciation and amortization increased by +€2.6 million with the new investments made in 2022 and 2023.Operating income reached €28.3million  down by -€2.8 million compared with 2022  after taking into account the net exceptional income of €2.4 million (linked on the one hand to accounting income of €3.5 million relating to the purchase in January 2023 of minority interests in the Modular Buildings business in Africa  and on the other hand to a $1.0 million conviction in the United States for the former subsidiary of Modular Buildings for an old dispute).Financial income came to -€21 million  compared with -€15.4 million in 2022. The increase in net interest expense is 85% explained by the interest rate rising  partially offset by hedging in place. As the net debt only slightly increases  the volume effect is limited on the financial income.Corporate income tax amounted to -€1.5million  +€4.8 million compared with 2022 when an exceptional tax provision of €3.8 million was accounted (no cash impact) in the Containers division.Net income Group share amounted to €3.6 million (compared with €7.5 million in 2022)  mainly explained by the increase of interest rates  while our diversified business model limits cycle impacts of our activities.A BALANCED FINANCIAL STRUCTUREThe strength of the TOUAX’s balance sheet is reflected in the Loan to Value ratio of 59.1% as of end-December 2023  compared with 59.5% in 2022.The financial structure has been reinforced by the debt refinancing carried out by the parent company Touax SCA  providing greater certainty over the debt profile until mid-2027 (EuroPP issuance of €5.4 million and implementation of a club-deal bank financing of €40 million).Shareholders' equity amounts to €147.6 million  compared with 153.7 million euros at the end of December 2022.At the group level  the allocation of the full-year profit of €3.6 million was offset by distributions (dividend and payment to general partners) totalling -€1.5 million  by a negative change in reserves mainly due to translation adjustments and decrease in hedge value amounting to -€5.2 million  and by a -€1.7 million reduction in minority interests in the Freight Railcars business.The level of cash on the balance sheet at 31 December 2023 remains comfortable  at €39.0 million.FAVOURABLE OUTLOOK AT THE HEART OF SUSTAINABLE TRANSPORT INFRASTRUCTUREIn the short term TOUAX remains cautious with the current economic challenges: uneven growth by geographical area  high interest rates  major geopolitical risks.Despite turbulences  trade volumes remain at a satisfactory level 2. The year-end utilisation rates (88% for freight railcars  100% for river barges and 97% for containers) demonstrate the resilience of the economies and markets where the group operates.In an uncertain environment  the flexibility provided by our leasing solutions is sought by our clients and creates investment opportunities.The requirement for fleet renewal and fleet modernization remain important  particularly as part of our customers objectives for reducing CO 2 emissions. With its expertise in the intermodal  rail and river transport sectors  TOUAX benefits from a unique position at the heart of sustainable transport infrastructure  and increases its commitment to Corporate and Social Responsibility  for a low-carbon economy.The strengthening of TOUAX's CSR commitment has been confirmed by the increase in its extra-financial ratings.

The consolidated financial statements have been audited in full. The auditors' report will be published once the due diligence procedures required for the publication of the annual financial report have been completed.Consolidated data (in € million)IFRS FY 2022(12 month) H1 2023(6 month) H2 2023(6 month) FY 2023(12 month) Change(23 vs. 22) Revenue 90.6 49.1 50.9 100.0 +10% Gross profit 54.4 28.4 31.5 59.9 +10% Gross profit / Revenue (%) 60.1% 57.8% 61.8% 59.8% EBITDA[2] 5.0 0.0 2.7 2.7 -47% EBITDA / Revenue (%) 5.6% - 5.3% 2.7% Operating profit (0.2) (2.4) 0.0 (2.4) Financial profit / loss (0.2) (0.9) (0.6) (1.5) Tax income 0.3 0.1 (0.2) (0.1) Group net profit (0.0) (3.3) (0.7) (4.0)Full Year 2023 ResultsTotal revenues amounted €100 million for the fiscal year ending 31 December 2023  up by 10% and by 12% on a like-for-like basis.Gross profit stood at €59.9m  up 10% and implying a margin of 59.8%  virtually the same level as in 2022. The Second Half gross margin amounted to 61.8%  up from 57.8% in the First Half.Monthly recurring revenues (MRR) stood at €2.470m in January 2024  reflecting a good pace of MRR creation in the Fourth Quarter of 2023  following a contraction of the MRR in the first nine months of 2023 due to the termination of a big subscription contract.Ateme begins the 2024 financial year with €29.6m in Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)  representing 30% of the 2023 revenues.Ateme continued to invest in supporting its growth in 2023. Operating costs rose by 14% to €62.3 million notably with an increase in total headcount from 560 to 580 over the year. These additional investments were balanced between the Sales and Marketing  up €3.6 million  and the R&D effort  up €3.5 million  respectively 13% and 17% up year-on-year  and to a lesser extent to G&A  up €0.5 million or 9% year-on-year.EBITDA stood at €2.7 million  versus €5.0 million in 2022  reflecting continued investments throughout 2023 and the timing of revenue recognition related to certain projects which shifted into 2024. The result exceeded expectations[4] thanks to an improved product mix and gross margin in the Second Half  as well the impact of cost reduction initiatives launched since mid-2023  that led to a stabilization in operating costs in H2 2023 compared to H1.The operating result stood at €-2.4 million  while the net result stood at €-4.0 million  integrating a €1.0 million negative financial result and foreign exchange losses of €0.5 million.Shareholders' equity stood at €38.0 million at 31 December 2023.Liquidity stood at €5.6 million  vs. €3.9 million a year earlier  notably due to the decrease in inventory (-€1.9 million) and in customer accounts receivable (-€1.0 million). Trade payables were also down (-€0.5 million).At 31 December 2023  net debt amounted to €23.8 million vs €20.1 million (excluding IFRS 16). This includes €12.3 million of Research Tax Credit receivable mobilized.Looking aheadAs communicated at the beginning of 2021  we aim from 2024 onwards to reap the benefits of three years of R&D and Sales & Marketing investments and improve profitability.

Data demonstrate that lacutamab showed robust clinical activity and an overall favorable safety profile. In this heavily pre-treated population  post-mogamulizumab  with a median of five prior lines of therapy  the global confirmed objective response rate (ORR) was 37.5% (21/56). Confirmed ORR in the skin was 46.4% (26/56) and confirmed ORR in the blood was 48.2% (27/56). Median progression-free survival was 8.0 months (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.7-21.2).In 2023  Innate reported interim data with lacutamab in mycosis fungoides (MF) patients at the EORTC Cutaneous Lymphoma Tumour Group Annual Meeting (September 2023) and the 17 th International Conference on Malignant Lymphoma (June 2023). The interim data set confirmed clinical activity and favorable safety profile of lacutamab in line with the Phase 1 data. The top-line results in MF patients are currently being analyzed and Innate intends to present the data in 2024 at a medical conference.International Conference on Malignant Lymphoma (June 2023). The interim data set confirmed clinical activity and favorable safety profile of lacutamab in line with the Phase 1 data. In January 2024  Innate announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has lifted the partial clinical hold previously placed on the lacutamab IND on October 2023 following a patient death in the TELLOMAK study. The FDA decision to lift the partial clinical hold is based on the FDA review of the fatal case which Innate  together with a steering committee of independent experts  determined to be related to aggressive disease progression and lacutamab unrelated.Peripheral T Cell lymphoma (PTCL)Despite objective responses observed  the Company-sponsored Phase 1b clinical trial evaluating lacutamab as monotherapy in patients with KIR3DL2-expressing refractory/relapsing PTCL will not be reopened to recruitment as the prespecified threshold for meaningful clinical activity was not reached.At the ASH Annual Congress 2023  Innate presented a poster with preclinical data demonstrating a synergistic effect between lacutamab and chemotherapy in preclinical models of PTCL  supporting the rationale for combination strategy in this clinical indication.The Phase 2 KILT (anti-KIR in T Cell Lymphoma) trial  an investigator-sponsored  randomized trial led by the Lymphoma Study Association (LYSA) to evaluate lacutamab in combination with chemotherapy GEMOX (gemcitabine in combination with oxaliplatin) versus GEMOX alone in patients with KIR3DL2-expressing relapsed/refractory PTCL is ongoing.ANKET® (Antibody-based NK cell Engager Therapeutics):ANKET® is Innate’s proprietary platform for developing next-generation  multi-specific NK cell engagers to treat certain types of cancer. Innate’s pipeline includes five public drug candidates born from the ANKET® platform: SAR443579 (SAR’579/IPH6101) (CD123-targeted)  SAR445514 (SAR’514/IPH6401) (BCMA-targeted)  IPH62 (B7-H3-targeted)  IPH67 (target undisclosed  solid tumors) and tetra-specific IPH6501 (CD20-targeted with IL-2v). Several other undisclosed proprietary preclinical targets are being explored.SAR’579  SAR’514  IPH62 and IPH67 (partnered with Sanofi)SAR443579/IPH6101The Phase 1/2 clinical trial by Sanofi is progressing well  evaluating SAR443579 / IPH6101  a trifunctional anti-CD123 NKp46×CD16 NK cell engager and ANKET ® platform lead asset  in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (R/R AML)  B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (HR-MDS). At the ASH Annual Congress 2023  Sanofi reported updated efficacy and safety results and data across all dose levels tested for SAR443579. As of October 23  2023  43 patients (42 R/R AML and 1 HR-MDS) across 8 Dose Levels (DLs) at 10 – 6000 μg/kg/dose were included. Patients had received a median of 2.0 (1.0 – 10.0) prior lines of treatment with 13 patients (30.2%) reporting prior hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and 36 patients (83.7%) with prior exposure to venetoclax. In DLs with a highest dose of 1000 μg/kg QW  5/15 AML (33.3%) patients achieved a CR (4 CR / 1 CRi) as of the cut-off date. As of the data cut-off on October 23  2023  two responders remain in remission after more than 12 and 14 months of treatment. SAR443579 was well tolerated up to doses of 6000 μg/kg QW with observed clinical benefit in patients with R/R AML. The results are consistent with the predicted favorable safety profile. Preliminary Pharmacokinetics (PK) and Pharmacodynamic (PD) Analysis of the CD123 NK Cell Engager SAR’579/IPH6101 in patients with relapsed or refractory AML  B-ALL or HR-MDS were presented during the ESMO (European Society for Medical Oncology) Congress 2023.platform lead asset  in patients with relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (R/R AML)  B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) or high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (HR-MDS). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Fast Track Designation for SAR’579 / IPH6101 for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia.SAR’514/IPH6401The Phase 1/2 clinical trial with SAR’514 / IPH6401  a trifunctional anti-BCMA Nkp46xCD16 NK cell engager  led by Sanofi  in patients with Relapsed/Refractory Multiple Myeloma and Relapsed/Refractory Light-chain Amyloidosis is ongoing.IPH62As announced on December 19  2022  Sanofi licensed IPH62  a NK cell engager program targeting B7-H3 from Innate’s ANKET® platform. Upon candidate selection  Sanofi will be responsible for all development  manufacturing and commercialization. Under the terms of the research collaboration and license agreement signed in December 2022  Innate received a €25m upfront payment and is eligible for up to €1.35bn total in preclinical  clinical  regulatory and commercial milestones plus royalties on potential net sales.IPH67In December 2023  Sanofi exercised its option to license a NK cell engager program in solid tumors from Innate’s ANKET® platform pursuant to the terms of the research collaboration and license agreement signed in December 2022. Following a research collaboration period  Sanofi will be responsible for all development  manufacturing and commercialization. Sanofi still retains the option to one additional ANKET® target. Innate received a €15m payment as option exercise.IPH6501 (proprietary)In March 2024 the first patient was dosed in the Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating IPH6501  Innate’s proprietary CD20-targeted IL-2v bearing second-generation ANKET® in B cell Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (B-NHL). The study is ongoing and planned to enroll up to 184 patients.Innate presented preclinical data on IPH6501 at the European Hematology Association (EHA) 2023 congress. In preclinical settings  IPH6501 was shown to induce NK cell proliferation and to trigger high NK cell cytotoxicity against CD20+ target cells in in vitro assays  in ex vivo assays with relapse/refractory (R/R) B-NHL patient samples who received at least one prior treatment  as well as in in vivo studies in non-human primates. A surrogate of IPH6501 mediated a potent anti-tumor activity in vivo in CD20+ tumor models in mice. In addition  in ex vivo assays with R/R B-NHL patient samples  IPH6501 was shown to be more efficient than a T-cell engager targeting CD20.Monalizumab (anti-NKG2A antibody)  partnered with AstraZeneca:The Phase 3 PACIFIC-9 trial run by AstraZeneca evaluating durvalumab (anti-PD-L1) in combination with monalizumab or AstraZeneca’s oleclumab (anti-CD73) in patients with unresectable  Stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have not progressed following definitive platinum-based concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CRT) is ongoing.IPH5201 (anti-CD39)  partnered with AstraZeneca:The MATISSE Phase 2 clinical trial conducted by Innate in neoadjuvant lung cancer for IPH5201  an anti-CD39 blocking monoclonal antibody developed in collaboration with AstraZeneca  is ongoing and recruitment is on track.IPH5301 (anti-CD73):The investigator-sponsored CHANCES Phase 1 trial of IPH5301 by Institut Paoli-Calmettes is ongoing.Antibody Drug Conjugates:Fueling its R&D pipeline  Innate continues to develop different approaches for the treatment of cancer utilizing its antibody engineering capabilities to deliver novel assets  with its innovative ANKET® platform and exploring Antibody Drug Conjugates (ADC) formats. Beyond its proprietary programs  Innate has an ongoing agreement with Takeda on ADCs.IPH45 (Nectin-4 ADC):IPH45 is Innate’s proprietary Nectin-4 targeting antibody drug conjugate including a Topoisomerase I inhibitor payload. IPH45 continues towards IND filing this year.Innate will share first preclinical data with IPH45 in an oral presentation at the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) 2024.Takeda license agreement:In April 2023  Innate announced that it has entered into an exclusive license agreement with Takeda under which Innate grants Takeda exclusive worldwide rights to research and develop antibody drug conjugates (ADC) using a panel of selected Innate antibodies against an undisclosed target  with a primary focus in Celiac disease. Under the terms of the license agreement  Innate received a $5m upfront payment and is eligible to receive up to $410m in future development  regulatory and commercial milestones if all milestones are achieved during the term of the agreement  plus royalties on potential net sales of any commercial product resulting from the license.Corporate Update:On April 26  2023  Innate announced the establishment of an At-The-Market (ATM) program  pursuant to which it may  from time to time  offer and sell to eligible investors a total gross amount of up to $75 million American Depositary Shares (“ADS”). Each ADS representing one ordinary share of Innate. As of December 31  2023  the balance available under our April 2023 sales agreement remains at $75 million.Dr. Sonia Quaratino  MD  PhD  has been appointed as Executive Vice President and Chief Medical Officer of Innate Pharma  effective October 2023.On December 18  2023  Innate announced that Mondher Mahjoubi has resigned from his position as Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chairman of the Executive Board of the Company  effective as of January 2024. Hervé Brailly  Innate Pharma’s Chairman of the Supervisory Board  former CEO and co-founder was appointed as interim CEO and Chairman of the Executive Board while a permanent successor is sought.Irina Staatz-Granzer  who has been Vice-Chairwoman of the Supervisory Board for several years was appointed Chairwoman of the Supervisory Board.Post period eventEarly January 2024  Innate announced that it has strengthened the Company’s leadership and corporate governance with the appointment of two new Executive Board members. Arvind Sood  Executive Vice President (EVP)  President of US Operations  Dr Sonia Quaratino  EVP  Chief Medical Officer  joining Hervé Brailly  interim Chief Executive Officer and Yannis Morel  EVP  appointed Chief Operating Officer.Innate announced that Arvind Sood had joined the Company in a newly created position of Executive Vice President and President of US Operations.Financial highlights for 2023:The key elements of Innate’s financial position and financial results as of and for the year ended December 31  2023 are as follows:Cash  cash equivalents  short-term investments and financial assets amounting to €102.3 million (€m) as of December 31  2023 (€136.6m as of December 31  2022)  including financial instruments amounting to €9.8m (€35.1m as of December 31  2022). Cash  cash equivalents as of December 31  2023 do not include the €15.0 million payment made by Sanofi following the exercise of the license option announced in December 2023. This amount was received by the Company in January 2024.As of December 31  2023  financial liabilities amount to €39.9m (€42.3m as of December 31  2022). This change is mainly due to loan repayments.Revenue and other income from continuing operations amounted to €61.6m in 2023 (2022: €57.7m  +6.9%). It mainly comprises revenue from collaboration and licensing agreements (€51.9m in 2023 vs €49.6m in 2022  +4.7%)  and research tax credit (€9.7m in 2023 vs €7.9m in 2022  +22.8%): Revenue from collaboration and licensing agreements  which mainly resulted from the partial or entire recognition of the proceeds received pursuant to the agreements with AstraZeneca  Sanofi and Takeda. They results from the partial or entire recognition of the proceeds received pursuant to the agreements with AstraZeneca  Sanofi and Takeda. They are recognized when the entity's performance obligation is met. Their accounting is made at a point in time or spread over time according to the percentage of completion of the work that the Company is committed to carry out under these agreements: (i) Revenue from collaboration and licensing agreements for monalizumab decreased by €12.9m to €9.5m in 2023 ( €22.4m in 2022). This change mainly results from the transaction price increase of €13.4m ($14.0m)  in the first half of 2022  triggered by the launch of the “PACIFIC-9” Phase 3 trial announced on April 29  2022. As a reminder  this increase in the transaction price generated a €12.6 million favorable cumulative adjustment in the revenue related to monalizumab agreements as of December 31 2022; (ii) Revenue related to the research collaboration and licensing agreement signed with Sanofi in 2022 amounted €34.7m as of December 31  2023. On January 25  2023  the Company announced the expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and the effectiveness of the licensing agreement as of January 24  2023. Consequently  the Company received an upfront payment of €25.0m in March 2023  including €18.5m for the exclusive license  €1.5m for the research work and €5.0m for the two additional targets options  for which the Company will recognize the related revenues either at the reporting date or three years after the effective date. The €18.5m upfront payment relating to the exclusive license has been fully recognized in revenue since June 30  2023. On December 19  2023  the Company announced that Sanofi had exercised one of the two license options for a new program based on the Company's ANKET ® platform. This decision triggered a milestone payment of €15.0m  including €13.3m for the exclusive license  fully recognized in revenue as of December 31  2023  and €1.7m for research work to be carried out by the Company as well as the recognition in revenue of an amount of €2.5m initially received in March 2023 in connection with this option; (iii) Revenue related to the license and collaboration agreement signed with Sanofi in 2016 decreased by €2.0m  to €2.0m for year ended December 31  2023  as compared to €4.0m for year ended December 31  2022. The Company announced that  in June 2023  the first patient was dosed in a Sanofi-sponsored Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating SAR'514/IPH6401 in relapsed or refractory Multiple Myeloma. As provided by the licensing agreement signed in 2016  Sanofi made a milestone payment of €2.0 million  fully recognized in revenue since of June 30  2023. This amount was received by the Company on July 21  2023. As a reminder  the revenue recognized 2022 mainly resulted from Sanofi's decision to advance SAR'514/IPH6401 into investigational new drug (IND)- enabling studies. This decision triggered a €3.0 million milestone payment from Sanofi to the Company  fully recognized in revenue as of June 30  2022; (iv) Revenue related to the licensing agreement signed with Takeda in 2023 amounted €4.6m for year ended December 31  2023. On April 3  2023  the Company announced that it has entered into an exclusive license agreement with Takeda under which Innate grants Takeda exclusive worldwide rights to research and develop antibody drug conjugates (ADC) using a panel of selected Innate antibodies against an undisclosed target  with a primary focus in Celiac disease. Takeda will be responsible for the future development  manufacture and commercialization of any potential products developed using the licensed antibodies. As such  the Company considers that the license granted is a right to use the intellectual property  which is granted fully and perpetually to Takeda. The agreement does not stipulate that Innate's activities will significantly affect the intellectual property granted during the life of the agreement. Consequently  the $5.0m (or €4.6m) initial payment  received by the Company in May 2023  was fully recognized in revenue since June 30  2023. The research tax credit (CIR) of €9.7m of as December 31  2023 (€7.9m for year ended December 31 December  2022  including 2022 fiscal year CIR for an amount of €9.2 million reduced by €1.3 million related to a provision following the tax inspection carried out in 2022 by the French tax authorities).Operating expenses from continuing operations and before impairment amounted to €74.3m in 2023 (2022: €74.1m  +0.3%): General and administrative (G&A) expenses from continuing activities amounted to €18.3m in 2023 (2022: €22.4m  -18.5%). This variation results cumulatively from (i) a reduction in personnel expenses  (ii) a reduction in non-scientific fees  (iii) the pursuit of cost savings (reduction in office space)  (iv) a reclassification of expenses relating to the support of R&D laboratory activities (maintenance  depreciation of R&D equipment) in the amount of €1.0 million. Research and development (R&D) expenses from continuing activities amounted to €56.0m in 2023 (2022: €51.7m  +8.4%). This change was mainly due to an increase in direct research and development expenses  notably for non-clinical development programs  partially offset by a decrease in expenses for clinical programs over the period. Indirect research and development expenses increased  mainly in the fields of personnel costs and depreciation  amortization and impairment.As a reminder  as of December 31  2022  the Company recognized the full impairment of the avdoralimab intangible asset (anti-C5aR rights) for an amount of €41 0m (non-cash expense) following the Company’s decision to stop avdoralimab development in bullous pemphigoid indication in inflammation.A net financial income of €5.1m in 2023 (2022: €0.5m loss).Net income from Lumoxiti discontinued operations are nil for year ended December 31  2023 as compared to a net loss of €0.1m for year ended December 31  2022 corresponding to residual costs associated with the transfer of activities to AstraZeneca. This transfer has now been completed.A net loss of €7.6m in 2023 (2022: net loss of €58.1m).The table below summarizes the IFRS consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31  2023  including 2022 comparative information.In thousands of euros  except for data per share December 31  2023 December 31  2022 Revenue and other income 61 641 57 674 Research and development (56 022) (51 663) Selling  general and administrative (18 288) (22 436) Total operating expenses (74 310) (74 099) Operating income (loss) before impairment (12 669) (57 425) Impairment of intangible asset — (41 000) Operating income (loss) after impairment (12 669) (57 425) Net financial income (loss) 5 099 (546) Income tax expense — — Net income (loss) from continuing operations (7 570) (57 972) Net income (loss) from discontinued operations — (131) Net income (loss) (7 570) (58 103) Weighted average number of shares outstanding (in thousands) 80 453 79 640 Basic income (loss) per share (0.09) (0.73) Diluted income (loss) per share (0.09) (0.73) Basic income (loss) per share from continuing operations (0.09) (0.73) Diluted income (loss) per share from continuing operations (0.09) (0.73) Basic income (loss) per share from discontinued operations — — Diluted income (loss) per share from discontinued operations — — December 31  2023 December 31  2021 Cash  cash equivalents and financial asset 102 252 136 604 Total assets 184 193 207 863 Shareholders’ equity 51 901 54 151 Total financial debt 39 893 42 251About Innate Pharma:Innate Pharma S.A. is a global  clinical-stage biotechnology company developing immunotherapies for cancer patients.

These revenues mainly result from the partial or entire recognition of the proceeds received pursuant to the agreements with AstraZeneca  Sanofi and Takeda. They are recognized when the entity's performance obligation is met. Their accounting is made at a point in time or spread over time according to the percentage of completion of the work that the Company is committed to carry out under these agreements. The evolution in 2023 is mainly due to:A €12.9 million decrease in revenue related to monalizumab to €9.5 million for the year ended December 31  2023  as compared to €22.4 million for the year ended December 31  2022. This decrease is mainly explained by the transaction price increase of €13.4 million ($14.0 million) in the first half of 2022 triggered by the launch of the “PACIFIC-9” Phase 3 trial on April 28  2022. As a reminder  this change in the transaction price generated a €12.6 million favorable cumulative adjustment in the revenue related to monalizumab agreements over the period. As of December 31  2023  the deferred revenue related to monalizumab amounts to €5.2 million entirely classified as “Deferred revenue—Current portion” in connection with the maturity of Phase 1/2 trials;Revenue related to IPH5201 are nil for the year ended December 31  2023. The €4.7 million revenue for year ended December 31  2022 resulted from the entire recognition in revenue of the $5.0 million milestone payment received from AstraZeneca following the signature on June 1  2022 of an amendment to the initial contract signed in October 2018. As a reminder  this amendment sets the terms of the collaboration following AstraZeneca’s decision to advance IPH5201 to a Phase 2 study. The Company conducts the study. Both parties share the external cost related to the study and incurred by the Company and AstraZeneca provides products necessary to conduct the clinical trial;As a reminder  during the 2022 first semester  the Company received from AstraZeneca a notice that it will not exercise its option to license the four preclinical programs covered in the ""Future Programs Option Agreement"". This option agreement was part of the 2018 multi-term agreement between AstraZeneca and the Company under which the Company received an upfront payment of $20.0 million (€17.4m). Innate has now regained full rights to further develop the four preclinical molecules. Consequently  the entire initial payment of $20.0 million  or €17.4 million was recognized as revenue as of June 30  2022;The recognition of €34.7 million in revenue as of December 31  2023  relating to the research collaboration and licensing agreement signed with Sanofi in 2022. On January 25  2023  the Company announced the expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and the effectiveness of the licensing agreement as of January 24  2023. Consequently  the Company received an upfront payment of €25.0m in March 2023  including €18.5m for the exclusive license  €1.5m for the research work and €5.0m for the two additional targets options  for which the Company will recognize the related revenues either at the reporting date or three years after the effective date. The €18.5m upfront payment relating to the exclusive license has been fully recognized in revenue since June 30  2023. On December 19  2023  the Company announced that Sanofi had exercised one of the two license options for a new program based on the Company's ANKET ® platform. This decision triggered a milestone payment of €15.0m  including €13.3m for the exclusive license  fully recognized in revenue as of December 31  2023  and €1.7m for research work to be carried out by the Company. Following the notification of the exercise of the option  the Company also recognized in revenue an amount of €2.5m initially received in March 2023 and related to this option. The cumulative payments of €3.2m received for research work are recognized on a straight-line basis over the duration of the research work that the Company has agreed to carry out. As of December 31  2023  the Company recognize in revenue an amount of €0.4 million based on the stage of completion of this work. The remaining amount of €2.8 million is recognized in deferred-revenue. Sanofi still retains a license option for an additional ANKET ® target  in accordance with the license agreement. Consequently  the corresponding upfront payment is also recognized in deferred-revenue as of December 31  2023 for an amount of €2.5m;platform. This decision triggered a milestone payment of €15.0m  including €13.3m for the exclusive license  fully recognized in revenue as of December 31  2023  and €1.7m for research work to be carried out by the Company. Following the notification of the exercise of the option  the Company also recognized in revenue an amount of €2.5m initially received in March 2023 and related to this option. The cumulative payments of €3.2m received for research work are recognized on a straight-line basis over the duration of the research work that the Company has agreed to carry out. As of December 31  2023  the Company recognize in revenue an amount of €0.4 million based on the stage of completion of this work. The remaining amount of €2.8 million is recognized in deferred-revenue. Sanofi still retains a license option for an additional ANKET target  in accordance with the license agreement. Consequently  the corresponding upfront payment is also recognized in deferred-revenue as of December 31  2023 for an amount of €2.5m; A €2.0 million decrease in revenue from the collaboration and research license agreement with Sanofi  to €2.0 million for the year ended December 31  2023  as compared to €4.0 million for the year ended December 31  2022. The Company announced that  in June 2023  the first patient was dosed in a Sanofi-sponsored Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating SAR'514/IPH6401 in relapsed or refractory Multiple Myeloma. As provided by the licensing agreement signed in 2016  Sanofi made a milestone payment of €2.0 million  fully recognized in revenue since of June 30  2023. This amount was received by the Company on July 21  2023. As a reminder  the revenue recognized 2022 mainly resulted from Sanofi's decision to advance SAR'514/IPH6401 into investigational new drug (IND)- enabling studies. This decision triggered a €3.0 million milestone payment from Sanofi to the Company  fully recognized in revenue as of June 30  2022;The recognition of €4.6 million in revenue as of December 31  2023  relating to the licensing agreement signed with Takeda in 2023. On April 3  2023  the Company announced that it has entered into an exclusive license agreement with Takeda under which Innate grants Takeda exclusive worldwide rights to research and develop antibody drug conjugates (ADC) using a panel of selected Innate antibodies against an undisclosed target  with a primary focus in Celiac disease. Takeda will be responsible for the future development  manufacture and commercialization of any potential products developed using the licensed antibodies. As such  the Company considers that the license granted is a right to use the intellectual property  which is granted fully and perpetually to Takeda. The agreement does not stipulate that Innate's activities will significantly affect the intellectual property granted during the life of the agreement. Consequently  the $5.0m (or €4.6m) initial payment  received by the Company in May 2023  was fully recognized in revenue since June 30  2023;A €0.2 million decrease in revenue from invoicing of research and development costs to €1.2 million for the year ended December 31  2023  as compared to €1.4 million for the year ended December 31  2022.Government funding for research expendituresGovernment funding for research expenditures increased by €1.7 million  or 21.1%  to €9.7 million for the year ended December 31  2023  as compared to €8.0 million for the year ended December 31  2022. As of December 31  2023  government funding is mainly comprised of research tax credit for for 2023 fiscal year for an amount of €9.8 million as compared to €7.9 million euros for year ended December 31  2022. As a reminder  the 2022 research tax credit included a reduction of €1.3 million related to a provision following the tax inspection carried out in 2022 by the French tax authorities. This provision was based on estimated amounts and adjustments not disputed by the Company. The change in the research tax credit is due to an increase in eligible expenses explained by (i) the increase in depreciation on IPH5201 rights following the full amortization of the additional payment of €2.0 million to Orega Biotech following the dosing of the first patient in the MATISSE Phase 2 clinical trial  compared with €0.6 million as of December 31  2022  and (ii) an increase in subcontracting expenses in connection with the IPH6501 program and the launch of work on the Lacutamab program. However  these increases are offset by the decrease in amortization of the monalizumab intangible asset due to the extension of the amortization period  as well as for certain tangible assets which had reached the end of their amortization period  and also by lower R&D personnel costs. The increase in expenses eligible for the research tax credit is also due to the absence of any grants received in 2023  which reduced the eligible base  as compared to 2022  when the eligible base was reduced by the receipt of the remaining repayable advance from the BPI for the amount of €0 7 million to support the independent Phase 2 clinical trial FOR COVID-19 Elimination (FORCE)  evaluating the safety and efficacy of avdoralimab in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia.The research tax credit is calculated as 30% of the amount of research and development expenses  net of grants received  eligible for the research tax credit for the fiscal year.Operating expensesThe table below presents our operating expenses from continuing operations for the years ended December 31  2023 and 2022:In thousands of euros December 31  2023 December 31  2022 Research and development expenses (56 022) (51 663) Selling  general and administrative expenses (18 288) (22 436) Operating expenses (74 310) (74 099)Research and development expensesResearch and development (“R&D”) expenses from continuing operations increased by €4.4 million  or 8.4%  to €56.0 million for the year ended December 31  2023  as compared to €51.7 million for the year ended December 31  2022. This increase over the period is mainly due to an increase in direct research and development expenses of €2.7 million over the period due to the significant increase in expenses relating to pre-clinical development programs  partly offset by the decrease in expenses relating to clinical programs. Research and development expenses represented a total of 75.4% and 69.7% of operating expenses for years ended December 31  2023 and December 31  2022  respectively.Direct research and development expenses increased by €2.7 million  or 9.8%  to €30.2 million for the year ended December 31  2023  as compared to direct research and development expenses of €27.5 million for the year ended December 31  2022. This increase is mainly due to: (i) a €3.2 million increase in expenses related to preclinical development programs relating notably to Antibody Drug Conjugates - ADC field  partly offset by a €0.5 million decrease in expenses related to the Company's clinical programs. This decrease in clinical programs expenses mainly results from a €0.4 million decrease in expenses relating to the monalizumab program  a €0.2 million decrease in expenses relating to the avdoralimab program and a €0.2 million decrease in expenses relating to the lacutamab program  partly offset by a €0.7 million increase in expenses related to the growth in IPH5201 Phase 2 trials patient recruitment.Also  as of December 31  2023  the collaboration liabilities relating to monalizumab and the agreements signed with AstraZeneca in April 2015  October 2018 and September 2020 amounted to €52.7 million  as compared to collaborations liabilities of €63.2 million as of December 31  2022. This decrease of €10.5m mainly results from (i) net repayment of €8.4 million during year 2023 to AstraZeneca linked to the Monalizumab cofinancing program  including Phase 3 trial INTERLINK-1 launched in October 2020 and PACIFIC-9 launched in April 2022  and (ii) the decrease of the collaboration commitment (""collaboration liabilities"" in the consolidated statements of financial position) for an amount of €2.0 million linked to the Euro-dollar parity exchange rate variation.Personnel and other expenses allocated to research and development increased by €1.7 million  or 6.9%  to €25.8 million for the year ended December 31  2023  as compared to an amount of €24.2 million for the year ended December 31  2022. This increase is due to the (i) €0.7 million increase in staff costs allocated to research and development  of which €0.5 million in personnel expenses and €0.2 million in share-based payment expenses  (ii) increase of €1.0 million in depreciation and amortization. The line item is mainly composed of the amortization of the monalizumab  IPH5201 intangible assets.General and administrative expensesGeneral and administrative (“G&A”) expenses from continuing operations decreased by €4.1 million  or 18.5% to €18.3 million for the year ended December 31  2023 as compared to €22.4 million for the year ended December 31  2022. G&A expenses represented a total of 24.6% and 30.3% of the total operating expenses for the years ended December 31  2023 and 2022  respectively.Personnel expenses  which include the compensation paid to our employees  decreased by €1.4 million  or 13.6%  to €8.8 million for the year ended December 31  2023  as compared to personnel expenses of €10.2 million for the year ended December 31  2022. This decrease mainly results from a decrease in wages of €1.2 million as well as a decrease of €0.2 million in share-based payment expenses mainly explained by the decrease of employees.Non-scientific advisory and consulting expenses mostly consist of auditing  accounting  legal and hiring services. These expenses decreased by €1.3 million  or 31.5%  to €2.9 million for the year ended December 31  2023  as compared to an amount of €4.2 million for the year ended December 31  2022. This decrease mainly results from operating efficiency measures  which led to a reduction in the number of new hires  and use of external communication and consulting services.Other general and administrative expenses relate to intellectual property  depreciation and amortization and other general  administrative expenses. These expenses decreased by €1.4 million or 17.9% to €6.5 million for the year ended December 31  2023  as compared to an amount of €8.0 million for the year ended December 31  2022.This decrease related notably to savings (reduction in office space) and a reclassification of R&D laboratory support costs (maintenance  depreciation of R&D equipment) for €1.0 million in R&D.Impairment of intangible assetsAs a reminder  as of December 31  2022  impairment of intangible assets was linked to the full depreciation of the avdoralimab intangible asset (anti-C5aR rights acquired from Novo/Nordisk A/S) for an amount of €41.0 million (non-cash expense) following Company’s decision to stop the development of avdoralimab in bullous pemphigoid (""BP"") indication in inflammation.Financial income (loss)  netWe recognized a net financial gain of €5.1 million for the year ended December 31  2023  as compared to €0.5 million net financial loss for the year ended December 31  2022. This change mainly results from interest income on financial investments (net gain of €2.5 million in 2023)  the change in the fair value of certain financial instruments (net gain of €1.6 million in 2023 as compared to a net loss of €1.6 million in 2022) and a net foreign exchange gain of €0.9 million in 2023 as compared to a net foreign exchange gain of €0.8 million in 2022.Net loss from discontinued operationsAs a reminder  a Termination and Transition Agreement was negotiated and executed  effective as of June 30  2021 further to the Company's decision to return the rights of Lumoxiti back to AstraZeneca. Consecutively  activities related to Lumoxiti are presented as discontinued operations since October 1  2021. Thus  the net income from discontinued operations related to Lumoxiti are nil as of December 31  2023 as compared to a net loss of €0.1 million as of December 31  2022 corresponding to residual costs associated with the transfer of activities to AstraZeneca. This transfer has now been completed.Balance sheet itemsCash  cash equivalents  short-term investments and financial assets (current and non-current) amounted to €102.3 million as of December 31  2023  as compared to €136.6 million as of December 31  2022. Net cash as of December 31  2023 (cash  cash equivalents and current financial assets less current financial liabilities) amounted to €83.5 million (€99.4 million as of December 31  2022).The other key balance sheet items as of December 31  2023 are:Deferred revenue of €10.5 million (including €4.6 million booked as ‘Deferred revenue – non-current portion’) and collaboration liabilities of €52.7 million (including €45.0 million booked as ‘Collaboration liability – non-current portion’) relating to the remainder of the initial payment received from AstraZeneca with respect to monalizumab  not yet recognized as revenue or used to co-fund the research and the development work performed by AstraZeneca including co-funding of the monalizumab program with AstraZeneca  notably the INTERLINK-1 and PACIFIC-9 Phase 3 trials;Intangible assets for a net book value of €0.4 million  mainly corresponding to the rights and licenses relating to the acquisitions of monalizumab (€1.6 million as of December 30  2022); variation between the two periods is mainly explained by depreciation of NKG2A asset over the period;Current receivables of €55.6 million  including €29.8 million from the French government related to the research tax credit for the 2019 and 2020 tax years  for which the three-year period expired on December 31  2023. The CIR repayment for 2019 for an amount of €16.7 million was made in February 2024. The repayment of the 2020 CIR is expected in 2024 for an amount of €13.0 million. Current receivables also include the €15.0 million invoice issued in December 2023 following the exercise of the license option by Sanofi. This amount was received by the Company in January 2024;Non-current receivables of €10.6 million from the French government mainly resulting from the 2023 research tax credit (€9.8 million);Shareholders’ equity of €51.9 million  including the net loss of the period of €7.6 million;Financial liabilities amounting to €39.9 million (€42.3 million as of December 31  2022).Cash-flow itemsThe net cash flow used over the year ended December 31  2023 amounted to €13.6 million  compared to a net cash flow used of €19.5 million for the year ended December 31  2022.The net cash flow used during the period under review mainly results from the following:Net cash used from operating activities of €32.6 million  mainly explained by (i) the receipt of €25.0 million from Sanofi in March 2023 following the entry into force of the research collaboration and licensing agreement signed in December 2022 under which the Company granted Genzyme Corporation  a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sanofi (""Sanofi"") an exclusive licence to Innate Pharma's B7H3 ANKET ® program and options on two additional targets  (ii) the receipt in May 2023 of a payment of €4.6 million ($5 0 million) received from Takeda following the conclusion of an exclusive licensing agreement under which Innate grants Takeda exclusive worldwide rights for the research and development of antibody conjugates (Antibodu Drug Conjugates - ADC)  (iii) the receipt in July 2023 of €2.0 million following the treatment of the first patient in the Phase 1/2 clinical trial sponsored by Sanofi evaluating IPH6401/SAR'514 in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. Lastly  (iv) during 2023  the Company benefited from the early repayment of the research tax credit claim relating to the 2022 financial year  amounting to €9.2 million  paid to the Company by the French Treasury in July 2023. As a reminder  cash flows used in operating activities for the year ended December 31  2022  included successive (i) the collection of €47.7 million ($50.0 million) and €4.6 million ($5.0 million) in June 2022 and August 2022 respectively  under the monalizumab agreement and the amendment to the IPH5201 collaboration and option agreement  (ii) the collection of €3.0 million received from Sanofi under the 2016 agreement and following Sanofi's decision to advance IPH6401/SAR'514 into regulatory preclinical studies for an investigational new drug  and (iii) in 2022  the Company collected the early repayment of the research tax credit receivable relating to the 2021 financial year for an amount of €10.3 million  paid to the Company by the French Treasury in November 2022. These collections were partially offset by the €5.9 million payment to AstraZeneca on April 20  2022 pursuant to the Lumoxiti termination and transition agreement and cash outflows related to the Company's operating activities. Not considering these specific effects   net cash flows used by operating activities for the year ended December  2023 decreased by €5.5 million. This decrease is mainly explained by the decrease in the Company's research and development activities  notably related to preclinical trials  and also by higher cash outflows related to the re-invoicing of costs to AstraZeneca for the Phase 3 trials evaluating monalizumab  INTERLINK-1 and PACIFIC-9  in accordance with the Company's co-financing commitments and the reduction in staff costs related to the reduction of staff in the Company. Also  net cash flow consumed by operating activities in connection with the Lumoxiti discontinued operation are nil for the year ended December 31  2023 as compared to € 5.1 million for the year 2022.

The Potential Business Combination is subject to certain pre-conditions including the completion of satisfactory due diligence by each party  respective board approvals  completion of definitive agreements  and the successful completion of a convertible debt capital raise process.Arkon is a Bitcoin data center infrastructure and mining business  that buys  develops  and owns valuable data center infrastructure at the intersection of electricity and data processing at an industrial scale that help power the trillion-dollar Bitcoin economy. Arkon currently has 117 megawatts (""MW"") of approved operating capacity across two data centers  including a 95MW flagship facility in Hannibal  Ohio  and a 22MW facility in Hopedale  Ohio. In addition  Arkon has binding agreements securing and entitling it to develop more sites in the United States  which would enable the Company to increase capacity by a further 190MW  bringing its total operating capacity to 307MW subject to successful funding and development of the sites. Arkon has signed a letter of intent to acquire an additional 100MW of further pipeline capacity within these same sites.Story continuesArkon’s business model is essentially based on two verticals: (i) hosting third-party Bitcoin mining machines  and (ii) self-mining Bitcoin with its own machines. The business model is based on the ownership and management of the underlying infrastructure that powers the machines  designed to enable flexibility in balancing both verticals while taking advantage of the current tailwinds in the Bitcoin ecosystem.The convertible debt capital raise would primarily be used to fund the infrastructure capital necessary to increase operating capacity to up to 307MW within the next nine months  including purchasing the latest generation mining machines  as well as refinancing an existing debt facility.The parties intend to simultaneously close the Potential Business Combination and the convertible debt raise. Subject to such closing  the combined Company intends to issue additional common shares listed on Euronext Amsterdam at the earliest opportunity.The discussions are ongoing and there is no certainty as to whether the parties will enter into definitive agreements regarding the Potential Business Combination  nor as to the terms of any such business combination.Further announcements will be made as and when appropriate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.IMPORTANT INFORMATIONThis press release may contain information that qualifies or may have qualified as inside information within the meaning of Article 7(1) of the EU Market Abuse Regulation.DISCLAIMERThis announcement is not for distribution or release  directly or indirectly  and should not be distributed in or sent into  the United States  Australia  Canada  Japan  the Cayman Islands or South Africa or any other jurisdiction in which such distribution or release would be unlawful or would require registration or other measures.
