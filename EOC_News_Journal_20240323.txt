37983,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rt.com/business/594663-eu-russian-frozen-assets-ukraine/,EU undecided on ways to tap Russian money,The EU will “explore options” for the seizure of revenues generated by frozen Russian assets until June  bloc leaders have said     Read Full Article at RT.com,The bloc will continue to look at options for using proceeds from frozen assets  leaders have said in a summit declarationThe EU will continue to “explore options” for the seizure of revenues generated by frozen Russian assets to fund Ukraine  bloc leaders said after a summit in Brussels on Thursday.The West has frozen roughly $300 billion in Russian sovereign funds since the start of the Ukraine conflict. Brussels-based clearinghouse Euroclear holds around €191 billion ($205 billion) of the funds and has accrued nearly €4.4 billion in interest over the past year.Profits on the assets are estimated to stand at €2-€3 billion this year. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has said the first tranche of €1 billion ($1.09 billion) could be disbursed as early as July.The EU is reportedly trying to fast-track the decision to fund Kiev amid waning support from the US  where a $60 billion aid package for Ukraine has stalled in Congress. In their summit declaration  EU leaders instructed officials to “explore all options for mobilizing funding and report back by June.”“I am confident that we can act very quickly ” Charles Michel  president of the European Council  told reporters.The EU is pressing ahead with a plan proposed by von der Leyen last month to use proceeds from Russian funds to procure arms for Ukraine.“These [proceeds] should first of all be used to buy those weapons and ammunition that Ukraine needs to defend itself ” German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said.The idea  however  has faced resistance from a number of countries  including Malta  Austria  Luxembourg  and Ireland. “For us neutrals it must be ensured that money  for which we give our approval  is not spent on weapons and ammunition ” Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer said  as quoted by Reuters.The proposal could also be blocked by Hungary  which has insisted that proceeds from Russian assets should be allocated to Ukraine’s reconstruction rather than be used for funding its military.Meanwhile  some Western banks are lobbying against the use of asset income  fearing it could lead to costly litigation  according to Reuters.Russian officials have repeatedly denounced the blocking of funds as “theft.” In December  Kremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov warned that any potential seizure would face a response  signaling that Moscow had already compiled a list of Western assets that could be expropriated in tit-for-tat action.,neutral,0.05,0.58,0.38,negative,0.03,0.28,0.69,True,English,"['Russian money', 'EU', 'ways', 'President Ursula von der Leyen', 'German Chancellor Olaf Scholz', 'Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer', 'Brussels-based clearinghouse Euroclear', '$60 billion aid package', 'Kremlin press secretary', 'Russian sovereign funds', 'Russian assets', 'The West', 'past year', 'European Commission', 'first tranche', 'waning support', 'Charles Michel', 'European Council', 'Western banks', 'asset income', 'costly litigation', 'Dmitry Peskov', 'tat action', 'Russian funds', 'frozen assets', 'Western assets', 'Russian officials', 'summit declaration', 'potential seizure', 'bloc leaders', 'Ukraine conflict', 'EU leaders', 'options', 'proceeds', 'revenues', 'Thursday', 'start', 'interest', 'Profits', 'July', 'decision', 'Kiev', 'Congress', 'funding', 'June', 'reporters', 'plan', 'arms', 'weapons', 'ammunition', 'idea', 'resistance', 'number', 'countries', 'Malta', 'Luxembourg', 'Ireland', 'neutrals', 'money', 'approval', 'Reuters', 'proposal', 'Hungary', 'reconstruction', 'military', 'blocking', 'December', 'response', 'Moscow', 'list', 'tit']",2024-03-22,2024-03-23,rt.com

37987,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.euractiv.com/section/global-europe/news/western-banks-warn-of-risks-in-eu-plan-to-grab-russian-assets/,Western banks warn of risks in EU plan to grab Russian assets,Some western banks are lobbying against EU proposals to redistribute billions of euros in interest earned on frozen Russian assets  senior industry sources said  fearing it could lead to costly litigation.,Some western banks are lobbying against EU proposals to redistribute billions of euros in interest earned on frozen Russian assets  senior industry sources said  fearing it could lead to costly litigation.European Union leaders on Thursday (21 March) agreed to move ahead with work on a plan to use up to €3 billion a year to supply arms to Ukraine as they try to bolster Kyiv’s fight against Russia  which would still own the underlying frozen assets. EU leaders said the proceeds could be used within a few months.Some banks fear  however  that they might later be held liable by Russia if they are involved in any transfer of money to Ukraine and that the EU plan could be extended to assets in accounts they hold for sanctioned individuals and companies.Such an extension has not yet been raised by the EU.The sources are also concerned that the proposals will lead to a wider erosion of trust in the western banking system.The sources  who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter  said they were sharing their concerns with British and eurozone policymakers  flagging likely litigation when anti-Russian sanctions are eventually eased or lifted.Russia says any attempt to take its capital or interest is “banditry” that will lead to decades of legal action against all those involved. Moscow has repeatedly said it will retaliate if its assets or income are expropriated.Euroclear holds the equivalent of €190 billion of Russian central bank securities and cash. Western banks also hold billions of euros  pounds and dollars in assets owned by companies and individuals subject to sanctions.More than 3.5 million Russians have frozen assets abroad worth around 1.5 trillion roubles (€15.7 billion)  Russia’s Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said last year.The EU plan envisages paying a fee to Euroclear  which did not respond to a request for comment.The Belgium-based central securities depository  which counts some of the world’s largest banks as shareholders  will also be permitted to temporarily retain 10% of the profits on stranded Russian assets as a safeguard against litigation.Under the EU plan  some 90% of the seized cash would be channelled through the European Peace Facility to buy arms for Ukraine. The rest will be used for recovery and reconstruction.EU  English and US sanctions law typically provides for freezing assets owned by designated parties  but not confiscation. Assets can be confiscated under English law  but only if ruled to be the proceeds of crime.Permitting the confiscation and redistribution of interest earned on those assets puts banks at risk of being challenged by owners  the sources said.One source warned of the precedent this proposal would set and the “weaponisation of foreign-held reserves and assets”.Russia itself has seized assets  installed new management at Western companies’ subsidiaries and forced departing firms to sell at huge discounts in response to Western sanctions.A second person said their bank was seeking legal advice on indemnities it could demand to participate in the EU’s plan.“If these proposals move forward  the whole legal architecture would need to change ” said Paul Feldberg  partner and head of Brown Rudnick’s White Collar Defense  Investigations & Compliance practice in London.“As far as banks go  I think they’re right to be concerned because we have already seen huge amounts of civil litigation in relation to sanctions ” said Feldberg  who is not currently directly involved in any lobbying.ReputationMoscow says that any confiscation would be a blow to property rights  harm confidence in Western bonds and currencies and torpedo trust between central banks.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov this week said the EU proposal would undermine international law and warned of inevitable damage to Europe and decades of legal wrangling.“The Europeans are well aware of the damage such decisions can cause to their economy and to their image  their reputation as a reliable  so to speak  guarantor of the inviolability of property ” Peskov told reporters.Francis Bond  senior associate at law firm Macfarlanes said the detail on the EU proposal was crucial when gauging the likelihood of prolonged international legal disputes.“…this proposal is not going to represent the end of this story but more likely the latest salvo in a perennial debate about the nature of sanctions and their appropriate role in the global financial system ” he said.The European Commission did not respond to a request for comment. Britain’s finance ministry deferred comment to the UK Foreign  Commonwealth and Development Office.The FCDO said British Foreign Secretary David Cameron had addressed the issue in a debate on 5 March in which he said: “The moral case is there — this money should be used for the benefit of the Ukrainian people”.‘Clawback’It is not yet clear how many EU member states will support the EU proposals or how quickly they could be implemented.In the meantime  lawyers examining them said indemnities would not necessarily neutralise potential litigants.“There isn’t an immediately obvious way for banks to insulate themselves comprehensively from future challenges and clawback actions ” Oliver Browne  litigation and arbitration partner at Paul Hastings  told Reuters.“Prudent financial institutions need to anticipate the likely future costs of the inevitable disputes that will come ” said Browne  who is not lobbying directly but is talking with clients who might be impacted by changes to sanctions law.A third industry source said the potential confiscations had compounded worries among bankers about their compliance with sanctions  including navigating any possible misalignment between the EU  Britain and the United States.Read more with Euractiv,negative,0.03,0.36,0.61,negative,0.02,0.3,0.68,True,English,"['Western banks', 'EU plan', 'Russian assets', 'risks', 'British Foreign Secretary David Cameron', 'Belgium-based central securities depository', 'Finance Minister Anton Siluanov', 'many EU member states', 'prolonged international legal disputes', 'Russian central bank securities', 'UK Foreign, Commonwealth', 'European Peace Facility', 'White Collar Defense', 'global financial system', 'European Union leaders', 'western banking system', 'The European Commission', 'senior industry sources', 'Western companies’ subsidiaries', 'US sanctions law', 'international law', 'finance ministry', 'central banks', 'EU leaders', 'senior associate', 'legal action', 'legal advice', 'legal architecture', 'legal wrangling', 'Western bonds', 'law firm', 'wider erosion', 'eurozone policymakers', '3.5 million Russians', '1.5 trillion roubles', 'designated parties', 'One source', 'foreign-held reserves', 'new management', 'departing firms', 'huge discounts', 'Western sanctions', 'second person', 'Brown Rudnick', 'Compliance practice', 'huge amounts', 'Kremlin spokesman', 'Francis Bond', 'latest salvo', 'appropriate role', 'Development Office', 'The FCDO', 'moral case', 'Ukrainian people', 'potential litigant', 'Russian assets', 'western banks', 'English law', 'anti-Russian sanctions', 'EU plan', 'largest banks', 'EU proposals', 'costly litigation', 'Paul Feldberg', 'civil litigation', 'property rights', 'torpedo trust', 'Dmitry Peskov', 'inevitable damage', 'perennial debate', 'frozen assets', 'billions', 'euros', 'interest', 'Thursday', '21 March', 'work', 'arms', 'Ukraine', 'Kyiv', 'fight', 'underlying', 'proceeds', 'months', 'transfer', 'money', 'accounts', 'individuals', 'extension', 'sensitivity', 'matter', 'concerns', 'attempt', 'capital', 'decades', 'Moscow', 'income', 'Euroclear', 'equivalent', 'cash', 'pounds', 'dollars', 'More', 'fee', 'request', 'comment', 'world', 'shareholders', 'profits', 'safeguard', 'recovery', 'reconstruction', 'freezing', 'confiscation', 'crime', 'redistribution', 'risk', 'owners', 'precedent', 'weaponisation', 'response', 'indemnities', 'partner', 'head', 'Investigations', 'London', 'relation', 'lobbying', 'Reputation', 'blow', 'confidence', 'currencies', 'Europeans', 'decisions', 'economy', 'image', 'reliable', 'guarantor', 'inviolability', 'reporters', 'Macfarlanes', 'detail', 'likelihood', 'end', 'story', 'nature', 'Britain', 'issue', '5 March', 'benefit', 'Clawback', 'meantime', 'lawyers']",2024-03-22,2024-03-23,euractiv.com

RESOLUTIONS PROPOSED BY THE BOARD Resolution on the allocation of the company's earnings as stated in the adopted Balance Sheet (item 10)The Board of Directors proposes that all profits at the disposal of the Annual General Meeting of SEK 1 952 374 913 be carried forward. The net result for the full year 2023 amounted to SEK 258 million  and the net result for the second half of the year amounted to SEK -106 million. As a result of the negative result for the second half of 2023  the Board of Directors has decided  in line with the company's dividend policy  not to propose a dividend to the Annual General Meeting in 2024. Presentation and approval of the remuneration report (item 19)The Board has prepared a remuneration report for 2023 and proposes that the Annual General Meeting approves the report. The remuneration report is included in the documents pertaining to the Annual General Meeting that are provided before the Annual General Meeting as below. Resolution on guidelines for remuneration of senior executives (item 20)The Board proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to adopt the following guidelines for remuneration of senior executives to apply until further notice  but no longer than until the 2028 Annual General Meeting. In relation to the guidelines adopted at the 2023 Annual General Meeting  the amendments are editorial. These guidelines apply to the CEO and other members of Group Management. The guidelines shall apply to remuneration as agreed  and changes that have been made to remuneration that have already been resolved since the adoption of the guidelines at the 2023 Annual General Meeting. The guidelines do not cover remuneration that is resolved by the Annual General Meeting. The guidelines' promotion of the company's business strategy  long-term interests and sustainabilityResurs conducts its operations within banking and insurance distribution  and the operations are divided into two business segments  based on the products and services offered: Payment Solutions (comprising Retail Finance  Credit Cards and Factoring) and Consumer Loans. The company strives to be a responsible enterprise that is run with the purpose of creating value for partners  customers  employees and owners in a long-term and sustainable manner. For more information on Resurs's business strategy  see www.resursholding.se/en/business-model-and-strategy/. Successfully safeguarding the company's long-term interests  including within sustainability  runs on the assumption that the company is able to recruit and retain qualified employees. In order to achieve this  the company must be able to offer competitive remuneration. These guidelines allow for competitive total remuneration to be offered to senior executives. The company previously established long-term incentive programmes based on warrants. These were resolved by the Annual General Meeting and are therefore not covered by these guidelines. For the same reason  the long-term performance-based share programme that the Board has proposed that the Annual General Meeting 2023 adopt or any future incentive programmes adopted by the Annual General Meeting are also not covered. All incentive programmes presented at the Annual General Meeting must provide a clear connection to the company's long-term value creation. Remuneration of senior executives is aimed at promoting the company's business strategy  long-term interests and sustainability  as well as counteracting unhealthy risk-taking. With this as a background  as well as considering the current regulations on systems of remuneration present in banking and insurance distribution operations  the remuneration subject to these guidelines shall not consist of variable remuneration. Resurs has assessed that fixed remuneration  together with long-term incentive programmes that are determined by the Annual General Meeting  create the optimal conditions to allow management to consistently focus on the company's long-term goals. Forms of remuneration etc.Remuneration shall be market-based and consist of the following components: fixed cash salary  pension benefits and other benefits. Additionally  the Annual General Meeting can resolve  for example  on share and share-price-related remuneration as above  which in this case  is not subject to these guidelines. For the CEO  pension benefits  including health insurance  shall be defined contribution. The pension premiums for defined contribution pensions shall not exceed 35 per cent of the fixed annual cash salary of the CEO. For other senior executives  pension benefits  including health insurance  shall be defined contribution unless the executive is covered by a defined benefit pension in accordance with mandatory collective agreements. The pension premiums for defined contribution pensions shall not exceed 30 per cent of the fixed annual cash salary of other senior executives. Other benefits may include life insurance  medical benefits insurance and company car benefit. Such benefits must not exceed 10 per cent of the fixed annual cash salary of other senior executives. For employment conditions that fall under other regulations than those in Sweden  in reference to pension benefits and other benefits  appropriate adjustments are made to follow mandatory rules or fixed local practices  whereby the general purpose of the guidelines is satisfied as far as possible. The current Group Management is subject to Swedish regulations. Termination of employmentFrom the company  the notice period for termination may be at most 12 months for the CEO and at most 12 months for other members of Group Management. From the senior executive  the notice period for termination may be at most six months. No termination benefits are paid. However  remuneration for potential commitments to restrict competition could be issued. Such remuneration shall  in accordance with the current laws  compensate for potential loss of income as a result of commitments to restrict competition. Remuneration shall be based on the fixed cash salary on the termination date  and be paid during the period that the commitment of the restriction of competition applies. Salary and terms of employment for employeesIn preparing the Board's proposals for these remuneration guidelines  salary and terms of employment for the company's employees are taken into account in so far as that information on the employees' total remuneration  the components of the remuneration and the remuneration's increase and rate of increase over time comprised a portion of the Remuneration Committee's and the Board's basis for decision-making on the evaluation of fairness of the guidelines and any resulting limitations. Decision making process for ensuring  monitoring and adapting the guidelinesThe Board has instituted a Remuneration Committee. The tasks of the Remuneration Committee include preparing the Board's resolutions on proposals for guidelines concerning remuneration of senior executives. The Board shall prepare proposals for new guidelines at least once every four years  and submit the proposal to be resolved by the Annual General Meeting. The guidelines are to be valid until new guidelines have been adopted by the Annual General Meeting. The Remuneration Committee shall also follow and evaluate the programme for variable remuneration for company management  the application of guidelines for remuneration for senior executives and the relevant remuneration structures and levels in the company. The Remuneration Committee's members are independent in relation to the company and its management. In the Board's processing of and decisions on remuneration related issues  the CEO and other individuals in company management are not present in circumstances when they are affected by the issue at hand. Deviations from the guidelinesThe Board may resolve to temporarily deviate from the guidelines partially or entirely should there be grounds to do so in a particular case  and should a deviation be deemed necessary in order to satisfy the company's long-term interests  including its sustainability  or to guarantee the company's financial buoyancy. As stated above  it is part of the role of the Remuneration Committee to prepare the Board's decisions on remuneration issues  which includes decisions on deviations from the guidelines. Resolution on the authorisation of the Board to resolve on the acquisition of own ordinary shares (item 21)The Board proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolve to once again provide the Board with authority to  on one or several occasions during the period up to the next Annual General Meeting  provided it is permissible by the applicable capital adequacy rules on each occasion  repurchase its own ordinary shares in accordance with the following conditions: Acquisition of own ordinary shares may be made of a maximum number of shares so that the company's holdings of own ordinary shares at any given time do not exceed five (5) per cent of all shares in the company. Acquisition of own ordinary shares must occur on Nasdaq Stockholm in accordance with Nasdaq Stockholm's Rule Book for Issuers. Acquisition of own ordinary shares may only be effected on Nasdaq Stockholm at a price per share within the registered span of share prices at the particular time  by which is meant the span between the highest price paid and the lowest selling price. The ordinary shares are to be paid for in cash. According to the Annual Report for the 2023 financial year  the company's unrestricted equity that is available for distribution by the Annual General Meeting (available profit and unrestricted reserves but excluding Additional Tier 1 instruments) amounted to SEK 1 952 374 913  which  thus remains of the disposable amount according to Ch. 17  Section 3  first paragraph of the Swedish Companies Act. The purpose of the authorisation to acquire own ordinary shares is to create a tool for the Board to continuously during the year adapt and improve the company's capital structure  including the calibration of the company's actual capital position in relation to its established target for the same  and thereby create additional value for shareholders. The purpose is also to provide the Board of Directors with an alternative to ensure supply of shares to participants in any future incentive program. Resolution on the authorisation of the Board to resolve on new issues of shares  warrants and/or convertibles (item 22)The Board proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorizes the Board  until the next Annual General Meeting  on one or several occasions  with or without deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  to resolve on new issues of shares  warrants and/or convertibles. Resolutions that are passed under the authorization may not  in the aggregate  involve an increase of the share capital by more than an amount  which corresponds to 10 per cent of the company's current share capital. The authorization shall also include the right to resolve on new issues where the shares are to be paid for with non-cash consideration or through set-off of a claim  or otherwise with terms and conditions pursuant to the Swedish Companies Act (2005:551) Chapter 13 Section 7  Chapter 14 Section 9  or Chapter 15 Section 9. The reasons for deviating from the shareholders' preferential right may be that possible targeted issues for the implementation of acquisitions of all or parts of other companies or operations  alternatively for the acquisition of capital to be used for such acquisitions or otherwise to create flexibility in raising capital. When using the authorization  the assessment made in connection with deviation from the shareholders' preferential right must be accounted for. The basis for the issue price shall be the share's market value. When using the authorization  the assessment made in this regard must also be accounted for. The Board further proposes that the Board  CEO or other person appointed by the Board or the CEO  shall be authorized to make such minor amendments in the resolution of the Annual General Meeting that may be necessary in order to effect the registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.

The amendments to the terms and conditions of the Notes will enter into force  and the Bank of Åland will commence to apply the Covered Bond Act to the Notes in accordance with Subsection 4 of Section 51 of the Covered Bond Act  on 22 April 2024.The amendments will be made in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Notes and in compliance with Subsection 4 of Section 51 of the Covered Bond Act which allows an issuer to commence applying the Covered Bond Act in relation to a covered bond which has been issued under the Finnish Act on Mortgage Credit Bank Operations (Fi. laki kiinnitysluottopankkitoiminnasta  688/2010) (the “MCBA”) in cases where acceptance from the noteholders is available.The Bank of Åland contemplates to merge its MCBA cover asset pool and CBA cover asset pool after the amendments announced herein enter into force so that it would only have one cover asset pool after the completion of the merger which would be in accordance with the CBA.Subparagraph 2 of paragraph 2 of condition 2 of the general terms and conditions included in the base prospectus dated 10 March 2020 relating to the Programme (the “General Terms and Conditions”) is amended in relation to the Notes to read as follows:“2) covered bonds (Fi. katetut joukkolainat) (Covered Bonds) under the Finnish Act on Mortgage Credit Banks and Covered Bonds (laki kiinnitysluottopankeista ja katetuista joukkolainoista  151/2022) (as amended or as replaced) (the Covered Bond Act)  as specified in the applicable Final Terms; or”Subparagraphs (i) and (ii) and the last paragraph in section (a) of condition 3.2 of the General Terms and Conditions are replaced in relation to the Notes with the following:“The Covered Bonds constitute direct  unconditional and unsubordinated obligations of the Issuer and rank pari passu among themselves and with all other obligations of the Issuer which benefit from the same priority right in respect of the statutory security in accordance with the Covered Bond Act. To the extent that claims of the Noteholders in relation to the Covered Bonds and claims of other creditors having the same priority in accordance with the Covered Bond Act are not fully met out of the assets of the Issuer that are covered in accordance with the Covered Bond Act  the residual claims of the Noteholders of the Covered Bonds will rank pari passu with the unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of the Issuer.No Noteholder shall in the liquidation or bankruptcy of the Issuer be entitled to exercise any right of set-off  netting or counterclaim against moneys owed under assets that are subject to the priority set out in Section 20 of the Covered Bond Act in respect of any Covered Bond.”Condition 6.10 of the General Terms and Conditions is amended in relation to the Notes to read as follows:“An Extended Maturity Date may apply to a Series of Covered Bonds  as specified in the applicable Final Terms.If “Extended Maturity” is specified as applicable in the applicable Final Terms  it enables the Issuer  at the latest on the fifth (5th) Business Day before the Maturity Date  to apply for the approval of the FIN-FSA that the Maturity Date of the Covered Bonds and the date on which the Covered Bonds will be due and repayable for the purposes of these Conditions should be extended by the Issuer up to but no later than the Extended Maturity Date. The FIN-FSA shall grant the approval for the extension of maturity if (i) the Issuer is unable to obtain long-term financing from ordinary sources  (ii) the Issuer is unable to meet the liquidity requirement set out in the Covered Bond Act if it makes payments towards the principal and interest of the maturing Covered Bonds and (iii) the extension of maturity of the Covered Bonds does not affect the sequence in which the Issuer’s Covered Bonds from the same Cover Asset Pool are maturing. In the event of a bankruptcy or liquidation of the Issuer  the bankruptcy administrator and the liquidator in the liquidation have  pursuant to the Covered Bond Act  at the request or with the consent of the supervisor  the right to apply for the approval of the FIN-FSA to extend the Maturity Date up to but no later than the Extended Maturity Date.If the FIN-FSA determines that the conditions for extension of the Maturity Date of the Covered Bonds have been fulfilled and it gives its approval to the extension  its resolution shall confirm the extended Maturity Date of the Covered Bonds and the date on which the Covered Bonds will then be due and repayable for the purposes of these Conditions  provided that the maturity of any Covered Bond may not be extended beyond the date falling twelve (12) months after the Maturity Date. In that event  the Issuer may redeem all or any part of the nominal amount outstanding of the Covered Bonds on an Interest Payment Date falling in any month after the Maturity Date up to and including the Extended Maturity Date.The Issuer shall give notice to the Noteholders (in accordance with Condition 14) of (a) any resolution of the FIN-FSA to approve the extension of the maturity of the Covered Bonds as soon as practicable after any such resolution having been made and (b) its intention to redeem all or any of the nominal amount outstanding of the Covered Bonds in full at least three (3) Business Days prior to (i) the Maturity Date  where practicable for the Issuer to do so and otherwise as soon as practicable after the relevant decision to redeem the Covered Bonds (if any) is made or  as applicable (ii) the relevant Interest Payment Date or  as applicable (iii) the Extended Maturity Date.Any failure by the Issuer to so notify such persons shall not affect the validity or effectiveness of any such extension of the maturity of the Notes or  as applicable  redemption by the Issuer on the Maturity Date or  as applicable  the relevant Interest Payment Date or  as applicable  the Extended Maturity Date or give rise to any such person having any rights in respect of any such redemption but such failure may result in a delay in payment being received by a Noteholder through Euroclear Finland or Euroclear Sweden  as applicable  (including on the Maturity Date where at least three Business Days’ notice of such redemption is not given to the Noteholders (in accordance with Condition 14)) and Noteholders shall not be entitled to further interest or any other payment in respect of such delay.In the case of Covered Bonds which are zero coupon notes up to (and including) the Maturity Date and for which an Extended Maturity Date is specified in the applicable Final Terms  for the purposes of this Condition 6.10  the nominal amount outstanding shall be the total amount otherwise payable by the Issuer on the Maturity Date less any payments made by the Issuer in respect of such amount in accordance with the Conditions.Any extension of the maturity of the Covered Bonds under this Condition 6.10 shall be irrevocable.

However  such issue of shares must never result in the company's issued share capital or the number of shares in the company at any time  being increased by more than a total of 20 per cent. The purpose of the authorization is to enable the board to make corporate acquisitions  product acquisitions or to enter into collaboration agreements  or to raise working capital or broaden the shareholder base.The CEO shall be authorized to make such minor adjustments to this resolution that may be necessary in connection with the registration thereof.Resolution regarding authorization for the board of directors to resolve to repurchase and transfer own shares (item 19)The board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting authorizes the board of directors to resolve to repurchase  on one or several occasions until the next annual general meeting  as many own shares as may be purchased without the company's holding at any time exceeding 10 per cent of the total number of shares in the company. The shares shall be purchased on Nasdaq Stockholm and only at a price per share within the price range applicable  i.e. the range between the highest purchase price and the lowest selling price.The board of directors also proposes that the annual general meeting authorizes the board of directors to resolve  on one or several occasions until the next annual general meeting  to transfer (sell) own shares. Transfers may be carried out on Nasdaq Stockholm at a price within the price range applicable  i.e. the range between the highest purchase price and the lowest selling price.

Under LTIP 2024  the participants will be granted  free of charge  (i) performance-based share awards (""Share Awards"")  and (ii) performance-based employee stock options (""Employee Stock Options"")  entitling to a maximum of 2 360 884 shares in Orexo  in accordance with the terms stipulated below. The Share Awards entitle to a maximum of 708 265 shares in Orexo and the Employee Stock Options entitle to a maximum of 1 652 619 shares in Orexo.The rationale for the proposalLTIP 2024 substantially corresponds with the performance based long-term incentive program adopted at the annual general meeting 2023 (LTIP 2023). LTIP 2024 is intended for certain senior executives and employees within the Orexo group. The board of directors of Orexo believes that an equity incentive program is an important part of a competitive remuneration package to be able to attract  retain and motivate qualified employees to the Orexo group. With reference thereto  the board of directors has decided to propose the adoption of a program corresponding to the program adopted at the annual general meeting 2023 (LTIP 2023). LTIP 2024 is based on performance-based Share Awards and Employee Stock Options and adapted to the current needs of the Orexo group.The purpose of LTIP 2024 is to attract  retain and motivate employees of the Orexo group  provide a competitive remuneration package and to align the interests of the senior executives and employees with the interests of the shareholders. The board of directors is of the opinion that this strengthens the interest for Orexo's business and also stimulates company loyalty in the future. In light of the above  the board of directors believes that the implementation of LTIP 2024 will have a positive effect on the development of the Orexo group and consequently that LTIP 2024 is beneficial to both the shareholders and the company.Conditions for Share Awards and Employee Stock OptionsThe following conditions shall apply for the Share Awards and the Employee Stock Options.- The Share Awards and the Employee Stock Options shall be granted free of charge to the participants as soon as possible following the annual general meeting 2024 and no later than on 30 June 2024. Out of the granted Share Awards and Employee Stock Options  30 percent shall constitute Share Awards and 70 percent shall constitute Employee Stock Options.- Each Share Award entitles the holder to receive one share in the company free of charge  except for the appropriate taxes  three years after the granting of the Share Award (the vesting period)  provided that the holder  with some exceptions  still is employed by the Orexo group.- Each Employee Stock Option entitles the holder to receive one share in the company upon payment of the strike price  three years after granting of the Employee Stock Option (the vesting period)  provided that the holder  with some exceptions  still is employed by the Orexo group. The strike price shall be fixed to 100 percent of the volume-weighted average price for the Orexo share during the ten trading days preceding the date of the annual general meeting 2024.- A prerequisite for entitlement to receive shares on the basis of Share Awards is that Performance Targets 1 and/or 2 have been satisfied pursuant to the terms and conditions specified below.- A prerequisite for entitlement to receive shares on the basis of Employee Stock Options is that Performance Target 1 has been satisfied pursuant to the terms and conditions specified below.- The number of Share Awards and Employee Stock Options encompassed by LTIP 2024 is to be re-calculated in the event that changes occur in Orexo's equity capital structure  such as a bonus issue  merger or consolidation of shares  new issue  reduction of the share capital or similar measures.- To make the participants' interest equal with the shareholders'  Orexo will compensate the participants for distributed dividends  if any  during the vesting period by increasing the number of shares that each Share Award and each Employee Stock Option  respectively  entitles to after the vesting period.- The Share Awards and the Employee Stock Options are non-transferable and may not be pledged.- The Share Awards and the Employee Stock Options can be granted by the parent company and any other company within the Orexo group.Performance ConditionsThe Share Awards are to be divided according to two different performance conditions encompassed by LTIP 2024. The performance conditions focus on the holder still being employed by the Orexo group (""Performance Target 1"") and Orexo's financial and operational targets for 2024 (""Performance Target 2""). Of each participant's granted Share Awards  approximately 33 percent (one third) will pertain to Performance Target 1 and up to approximately 67 percent (two thirds) will pertain to Performance Target 2.The Employee Stock Options are to be divided according to one performance condition encompassed by LTIP 2024  which is Performance Target 1. Of each participant's granted Employee Stock Options  100 percent will pertain to Performance Target 1  meaning that no Employee Stock Options will vest unless the performance target is met.The allotment of shares that each participant later may receive depends on achievement of the established performance targets as described below.Performance Target 1 (for Share Awards and Employee Stock Options) : This target pertains to the holder still being employed by the Orexo group upon vesting.Performance Target 2 (for Share Awards) : This target pertains to the fulfilment of the financial and operational targets for the financial year 2024 as established by the board of directors and relates to Orexo's key KPIs as for example revenue  profitability and achieved milestones  etc. Performance achievement of individual targets is weighted into an overall average performance achievement. The outcome will be measured lineally; meaning that from zero to 100 percent of the Share Awards will vest depending on the overall average rate of performance of the financial and operational targets. All Share Awards will vest and entitle to one share each if 100 percent of the overall average performance is achieved. When calculating the overall performance achievement  individual targets may account for a maximum of 120 percent achievement  but the overall average performance is capped at 100 percent. If performance achievement falls below 80 percent for an individual target  this individual target accounts for zero in the calculation of the overall average achieved.The board of directors will present the rate of achievement of Performance Target 2 in the annual report for 2024.AllocationThe participants are divided into two allocation categories: (i) CEO and other members of group management; (ii) other personnel. The maximum number of Share Awards and Employee Stock Options that a participant may be granted in LTIP 2024 depends on the category to which the participant belongs.To ensure that the value of the share-based remuneration does not reach an unintended level in relation to other remuneration  the value of the Share Awards and Employee Stock Options granted to the CEO and group management must not  at the time of the grant  exceed a value equal to the person's current annual base salary. For other personnel the value must not exceed 33 percent of the annual base salary.The board of directors shall resolve upon the final allocation of the Share Awards and Employee Stock Options as soon as possible after the annual general meeting. Several factors will be considered in order to secure recruitment  retention and motivation when deciding upon individual allocations including position within Orexo  individual performance and total value of current remuneration package. Individual allocation cannot exceed the above-mentioned limit for the category that the individual belongs to. Out of the allocated Share Awards and Employee Stock Options  30 percent will constitute Share Awards and 70 percent will constitute Employee Stock Options.The share price that is to form the basis for calculating the number of Share Awards and Employee Stock Options is to correspond to the average last price paid during a given period of trading. This period comprises the first ten days of trading immediately following the date of the 2024 annual general meeting. The share price is then divided by the individual granting value in order to arrive at the total number of Share Awards and Employee Stock Options granted per participant.Preparation and administrationThe board of directors shall be responsible for preparing the detailed terms and conditions of LTIP 2024  in accordance with the mentioned terms and guidelines. To this end  the board of directors shall be entitled to make adjustments to meet foreign regulations or market conditions. The board of directors may also make other adjustments if significant changes in the Orexo group  or its operating environment  would result in a situation where the decided terms and conditions for LTIP 2024 no longer are appropriate. Prior to finally determining allotment of shares on the basis of Share Awards and Employee Stock Options  the board of directors will assess whether the outcome of LTIP 2024 is reasonable. This assessment will be conducted in relation to the company's financial earnings and position  conditions in the stock market and other circumstances. Should the board of directors not consider the outcome to be reasonable  the number of shares to be allotted will be reduced.Preparation of the proposalLTIP 2024 has been initiated by the board of directors of Orexo and has been structured in consultation with external advisers based on an evaluation of prior incentive programs and best market practices. LTIP 2024 has been prepared by the remuneration committee and reviewed at meetings of the board of directors.Scope and costs of the programLTIP 2024 will be accounted for in accordance with ""IFRS 2 - Share-based payments"". IFRS 2 stipulates that the Share Awards and Employee Stock Options should be expensed as personnel costs over the vesting period and will be accounted for directly against equity. Personnel costs in accordance with IFRS 2 do not affect the company's cash flow. Social security costs will be expensed in the income statement during the vesting period.Assuming a share price at the time of implementation of SEK 15.60  that Performance Target 1 is achieved and that Performance Target 2 is achieved at 50 percent  including a share price increase of 30 percent during the vesting period  the total cost for LTIP 2024 including social security costs is estimated to approximately SEK 27.0 million before tax. The corresponding total cost with full achievement of Performance Target 1 and Performance Target 2  including a share price increase of 60 percent during the vesting period  is estimated to approximately SEK 39.2 million before tax.LTIP 2024 will have marginal effects on Orexo's key ratios since delivery of shares shall be made by way of transfer of Orexo's repurchased shares as is described under section ""Delivery under LTIP 2024"" below.Since delivery of shares under LTIP 2024 shall be made by way of transfer of Orexo's repurchased shares  LTIP 2024 entails no dilution of the shareholding of the company. The maximum level of dilution for all other outstanding long-term incentive programs in the company amounts to 0 percent  since delivery of shares shall be made by way of transfer of Orexo's repurchased shares.Information on Orexo's existing incentive programs can be found in the 2023 annual report  note 10 and 24  as well as on the company's website www.orexo.com.Delivery under LTIP 2024The board of directors proposes that delivery of shares under LTIP 2024 shall be made by way of transfer of Orexo's repurchased shares. In addition  the board of directors proposes that delivery may also be satisfied through payment of a cash amount that is equal to the value of the Orexo share on the date of vesting less the applicable strike price for any Employee Stock Options.Resolution regarding adoption of new performance-based long-term incentive program LTIP Stay-on 2024 (item 21)The board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to implement a new performance-based long-term incentive program for certain Global Management Team (""GMT"") employees and US Leadership Team (""USLT"") employees within the Orexo group (""LTIP Stay-on 2024""). LTIP Stay-on 2024 is proposed to include up to approximately 13 GMT and USLT employees within the Orexo group.LTIP Stay-on 2024 is a three-year performance-based program. Under LTIP Stay-on 2024  the participants will be granted  free of charge  (i) performance-based share awards (""Share Awards"")  and (ii) performance-based employee stock options (""Employee Stock Options"")  entitling to a maximum of 70 000 shares in Orexo  in accordance with the terms stipulated below. The Share Awards entitle to a maximum of 35 000 shares in Orexo and the Employee Stock Options entitle to a maximum of 35 000 shares in Orexo.The rationale for the proposalLTIP Stay-on 2024 substantially corresponds with the performance based long-term incentive program adopted at the annual general meeting 2023 (LTIP Stay-on 2023). LTIP Stay-on 2024 is intended for certain GMT and USLT employees within the Orexo group and qualification for participation in LTIP Stay-on 2024 is conditional upon the participant either keeping shares from allocations in Orexo's other on-going long-term incentive programs (the ""implemented LTIPs"") or investing in new Orexo shares with part of or the entire annual cash bonus of the participant. The board of directors of Orexo believes that an equity incentive program is an important part of a competitive remuneration package to be able to attract  retain and motivate qualified employees to the Orexo group. The board of directors further believes that LTIP Stay-on 2024 constitutes an important incentive for GMT and USLT employees to keep shares in the company. With reference thereto  the board of directors has decided to propose the adoption of a program corresponding to the program adopted at the annual general meeting 2023 (LTIP Stay-on 2023). LTIP Stay-on 2024 is based on performance-based Share Awards and Employee Stock Options and adapted to the current needs of the Orexo group.The purpose of LTIP Stay-on 2024 is to attract  retain and motivate employees of the Orexo group  provide a competitive remuneration package and to align the interests of GMT and USLT employees with the interests of the shareholders. The board of directors is of the opinion that this strengthens the interest for Orexo's business and also stimulates company loyalty in the future. In light of the above  the board of directors believes that the implementation of LTIP Stay-on 2024 will have a positive effect on the development of the Orexo group and consequently that LTIP Stay-on 2024 is beneficial to both the shareholders and the company.Conditions for Share Awards and Employee Stock OptionsThe following conditions shall apply for the Share Awards and the Employee Stock Options.- Qualification for participation in LTIP Stay-on 2024 is conditional upon the participant (i) keeping shares from allocations in any of Orexo's implemented LTIPs between 1 May 2024 and 31 July 2024 (""Opt-in 1"")  or (ii) investing in new Orexo shares with part of or the entire annual cash bonus of the participant between 1 February 2025 and 30 April 2025 (""Opt-in 2"").- Under Opt-in 1  the Share Awards and the Employee Stock Options shall be granted free of charge to the participants as soon as possible after 31 July 2024 and no later than on 31 August 2024.- Under Opt-in 2  the Share Awards and the Employee Stock Options shall be granted free of charge to the participants as soon as possible after 30 April 2025 and no later than on 31 May 2025.- Out of the granted Share Awards and Employee Stock Options  50 percent shall constitute Share Awards and 50 percent shall constitute Employee Stock Options. Every five (5) shares kept in accordance with Opt-in 1 and every five (5) shares acquired in accordance with Opt-in 2  respectively  entitle the participant to one (1) Share Award and one (1) Employee Stock Option.- Each Share Award entitles the holder to receive one share in the company  free of charge  except for the appropriate taxes  three years after the granting of the Share Award (the vesting period)  provided that the holder  with some exceptions  still is employed by the Orexo group.- Each Employee Stock Option entitles the holder to receive one share in the company upon payment of the strike price  three years after the granting of the Employee Stock Option (the vesting period)  provided that the holder  with some exceptions  still is employed by the Orexo group. The strike price shall be fixed to 100 percent of the volume-weighted average price for the Orexo share during the ten trading days preceding the date of the annual general meeting 2024.- A prerequisite for entitlement to receive shares on the basis of Share Awards is that Performance Targets 1 and/or 2 have been satisfied pursuant to the terms and conditions specified below.- A prerequisite for entitlement to receive shares on the basis of Employee Stock Options is that Performance Target 1 has been satisfied pursuant to the terms and conditions specified below.- The number of Share Awards and Employee Stock Options encompassed by LTIP Stay-on 2024 is to be re-calculated in the event that changes occur in Orexo's equity capital structure  such as a bonus issue  merger or consolidation of shares  new issue  reduction of the share capital or similar measures.- To make the participants' interest equal with the shareholders'  Orexo will compensate the participants for distributed dividends  if any  during the vesting period by increasing the number of shares that each Share Award and each Employee Stock Option  respectively  entitles to after the vesting period.- The Share Awards and the Employee Stock Options are non-transferable and may not be pledged.- The Share Awards and the Employee Stock Options can be granted by the parent company and any other company within the Orexo group.Performance ConditionsThe Share Awards are to be divided according to two different performance conditions encompassed by LTIP Stay-on 2024. The performance conditions focus on the holder still being employed by the Orexo group (""Performance Target 1"") and Orexo's financial and operational targets for 2024 (""Performance Target 2""). Of each participant's granted Share Awards  50 percent will pertain to Performance Target 1 and up to 50 percent will pertain to Performance Target 2.The Employee Stock Options are to be divided according to one performance condition encompassed by LTIP Stay-on 2024  which is Performance Target 1. Of each participant's granted Employee Stock Options  100 percent will pertain to Performance Target 1  meaning that no Employee Stock Options will vest unless the performance target is met.The allotment of shares that each participant later may receive depends on achievement of the established performance targets as described below.Performance Target 1 (for Share Awards and Employee Stock Options) : This target pertains to the holder still being employed by the Orexo group upon vesting.Performance Target 2 (for Share Awards) : This target pertains to the fulfilment of the financial and operational targets for the financial year 2024 as established by the board of directors and relates to Orexo's key KPIs as for example revenue  profitability and achieved milestones  etc. Performance achievement of individual targets is weighted into an overall average performance achievement. The outcome will be measured lineally; meaning that from zero to 100 percent of the Share Awards will vest depending on the overall average rate of performance of the financial and operational targets. All Share Awards will vest and entitle to one share each if 100 percent of the overall average performance is achieved. When calculating the overall performance achievement  individual targets may account for a maximum of 120 percent achievement  but the overall average performance is capped at 100 percent. If performance achievement falls below 80 percent for an individual target  this individual target accounts for zero in the calculation of the overall average achieved.The board of directors will present the rate of achievement of Performance Target 2 in the Annual Report for 2024.AllocationEvery five (5) shares kept in accordance with Opt-in 1 and every five (5) shares acquired in accordance with Opt-in 2  respectively  entitle the participants of LTIP Stay-on 2024 to one (1) Share Award and one (1) Employee Stock Option.

In relation to allocation under Opt-in 2  the board of directors shall resolve upon the final allocation of the Share Awards and Employee Stock Options as soon as possible after 30 April 2025.Preparation and administrationThe board of directors shall be responsible for preparing the detailed terms and conditions of LTIP Stay-on 2024  in accordance with the mentioned terms and guidelines. To this end  the board of directors shall be entitled to make adjustments to meet foreign regulations or market conditions. The board of directors may also make other adjustments if significant changes in the Orexo group  or its operating environment  would result in a situation where the decided terms and conditions for LTIP Stay-on 2024 no longer are appropriate. Prior to finally determining allotment of shares on the basis of Share Awards and Employee Stock Options  the board of directors will assess whether the outcome of LTIP Stay-on 2024 is reasonable. This assessment will be conducted in relation to the company's financial earnings and position  conditions in the stock market and other circumstances. Should the board of directors not consider the outcome to be reasonable  the number of shares to be allotted will be reduced.Preparation of the proposalLTIP Stay-on 2024 has been initiated by the board of directors of Orexo and has been structured in consultation with external advisers based on an evaluation of prior incentive programs and best market practices. LTIP Stay-on 2024 has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee and reviewed at meetings of the board of directors.Scope and costs of the programLTIP Stay-on 2024 will be accounted for in accordance with ""IFRS 2 - Share-based payments"". IFRS 2 stipulates that the Share Awards and Employee Stock Options should be expensed as personnel costs over the vesting period and will be accounted for directly against equity. Personnel costs in accordance with IFRS 2 do not affect the company's cash flow. Social security costs will be expensed in the income statement during the vesting period.Assuming a share price at the time of implementation of SEK 15.60  that Performance Target 1 is achieved and that Performance Target 2 is achieved at 50 percent  including a share price increase of 30 percent during the vesting period  the total cost for LTIP Stay-on 2024 including social security costs is estimated to approximately SEK 0.9 million before tax. The corresponding total cost with full achievement of Performance Target 1 and Performance Target 2  including a share price increase of 60 percent during the vesting period  is estimated to approximately SEK 1.2 million before tax.LTIP Stay-on 2024 will have marginal effects on Orexo's key ratios since delivery of shares shall be made by way of transfer of Orexo's repurchased shares as is described under section ""Delivery under LTIP Stay-on 2024"" below.Since delivery of shares under LTIP Stay-on 2024 shall be made by way of transfer of Orexo's repurchased shares  LTIP Stay-on 2024 entails no dilution of the shareholding of the company. The maximum level of dilution for all other outstanding long-term incentive programs in the company amounts to 0 percent  since delivery of shares shall be made by way of transfer of Orexo's repurchased shares.Information on Orexo's existing incentive programs can be found in the 2023 annual report  note 10 and 24  as well as on the company's website www.orexo.com.Delivery under LTIP Stay-on 2024The board of directors proposes that delivery of shares under LTIP Stay-on 2024 shall be made by way of transfer of Orexo's repurchased shares. In addition  the board of directors proposes that delivery may also be satisfied through payment of a cash amount that is equal to the value of the Orexo share on the date of vesting less the applicable strike price for any Employee Stock Options.A resolution in accordance with the board of directors' proposal in item 18 shall only be valid where supported by not less than two-thirds of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the meeting and resolutions in accordance with the board of directors' proposal in items 19  20 and 21 shall only be valid where supported by not less than nine-tenths of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the meeting.The shareholders are reminded of their right to request information in accordance with Chapter 7 Section 32 of the Swedish Companies Act.

However  such issue of shares must never result in the company's issued share capital or the number of shares in the company at any time  being increased by more than a total of 20 per cent. The purpose of the authorization is to enable the board to make corporate acquisitions  product acquisitions or to enter into collaboration agreements  or to raise working capital or broaden the shareholder base.The CEO shall be authorized to make such minor adjustments to this resolution that may be necessary in connection with the registration thereof.Resolution regarding authorization for the board of directors to resolve to repurchase and transfer own shares (item 19)The board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting authorizes the board of directors to resolve to repurchase  on one or several occasions until the next annual general meeting  as many own shares as may be purchased without the company's holding at any time exceeding 10 per cent of the total number of shares in the company. The shares shall be purchased on Nasdaq Stockholm and only at a price per share within the price range applicable  i.e. the range between the highest purchase price and the lowest selling price.The board of directors also proposes that the annual general meeting authorizes the board of directors to resolve  on one or several occasions until the next annual general meeting  to transfer (sell) own shares. Transfers may be carried out on Nasdaq Stockholm at a price within the price range applicable  i.e. the range between the highest purchase price and the lowest selling price.

Under LTIP 2024  the participants will be granted  free of charge  (i) performance-based share awards ("" Share Awards "")  and (ii) performance-based employee stock options ("" Employee Stock Options "")  entitling to a maximum of 2 360 884 shares in Orexo  in accordance with the terms stipulated below. The Share Awards entitle to a maximum of 708 265 shares in Orexo and the Employee Stock Options entitle to a maximum of 1 652 619 shares in Orexo.The rationale for the proposalLTIP 2024 substantially corresponds with the performance based long-term incentive program adopted at the annual general meeting 2023 (LTIP 2023). LTIP 2024 is intended for certain senior executives and employees within the Orexo group. The board of directors of Orexo believes that an equity incentive program is an important part of a competitive remuneration package to be able to attract  retain and motivate qualified employees to the Orexo group. With reference thereto  the board of directors has decided to propose the adoption of a program corresponding to the program adopted at the annual general meeting 2023 (LTIP 2023). LTIP 2024 is based on performance-based Share Awards and Employee Stock Options and adapted to the current needs of the Orexo group.The purpose of LTIP 2024 is to attract  retain and motivate employees of the Orexo group  provide a competitive remuneration package and to align the interests of the senior executives and employees with the interests of the shareholders. The board of directors is of the opinion that this strengthens the interest for Orexo's business and also stimulates company loyalty in the future. In light of the above  the board of directors believes that the implementation of LTIP 2024 will have a positive effect on the development of the Orexo group and consequently that LTIP 2024 is beneficial to both the shareholders and the company.Conditions for Share Awards and Employee Stock OptionsThe following conditions shall apply for the Share Awards and the Employee Stock Options.- The Share Awards and the Employee Stock Options shall be granted free of charge to the participants as soon as possible following the annual general meeting 2024 and no later than on 30 June 2024 . Out of the granted Share Awards and Employee Stock Options  30 percent shall constitute Share Awards and 70 percent shall constitute Employee Stock Options.- Each Share Award entitles the holder to receive one share in the company free of charge  except for the appropriate taxes  three years after the granting of the Share Award (the vesting period)  provided that the holder  with some exceptions  still is employed by the Orexo group.- Each Employee Stock Option entitles the holder to receive one share in the company upon payment of the strike price  three years after granting of the Employee Stock Option (the vesting period)  provided that the holder  with some exceptions  still is employed by the Orexo group. The strike price shall be fixed to 100 percent of the volume-weighted average price for the Orexo share during the ten trading days preceding the date of the annual general meeting 2024.- A prerequisite for entitlement to receive shares on the basis of Share Awards is that Performance Targets 1 and/or 2 have been satisfied pursuant to the terms and conditions specified below.- A prerequisite for entitlement to receive shares on the basis of Employee Stock Options is that Performance Target 1 has been satisfied pursuant to the terms and conditions specified below.- The number of Share Awards and Employee Stock Options encompassed by LTIP 2024 is to be re-calculated in the event that changes occur in Orexo's equity capital structure  such as a bonus issue  merger or consolidation of shares  new issue  reduction of the share capital or similar measures.- To make the participants' interest equal with the shareholders'  Orexo will compensate the participants for distributed dividends  if any  during the vesting period by increasing the number of shares that each Share Award and each Employee Stock Option  respectively  entitles to after the vesting period.- The Share Awards and the Employee Stock Options are non-transferable and may not be pledged.- The Share Awards and the Employee Stock Options can be granted by the parent company and any other company within the Orexo group.Performance ConditionsThe Share Awards are to be divided according to two different performance conditions encompassed by LTIP 2024. The performance conditions focus on the holder still being employed by the Orexo group ("" Performance Target 1 "") and Orexo's financial and operational targets for 2024 ("" Performance Target 2 ""). Of each participant's granted Share Awards  approximately 33 percent (one third) will pertain to Performance Target 1 and up to approximately 67 percent (two thirds) will pertain to Performance Target 2.The Employee Stock Options are to be divided according to one performance condition encompassed by LTIP 2024  which is Performance Target 1. Of each participant's granted Employee Stock Options  100 percent will pertain to Performance Target 1  meaning that no Employee Stock Options will vest unless the performance target is met.The allotment of shares that each participant later may receive depends on achievement of the established performance targets as described below.Performance Target 1 (for Share Awards and Employee Stock Options) : This target pertains to the holder still being employed by the Orexo group upon vesting.Performance Target 2 (for Share Awards) : This target pertains to the fulfilment of the financial and operational targets for the financial year 2024 as established by the board of directors and relates to Orexo's key KPIs as for example revenue  profitability and achieved milestones  etc. Performance achievement of individual targets is weighted into an overall average performance achievement. The outcome will be measured lineally; meaning that from zero to 100 percent of the Share Awards will vest depending on the overall average rate of performance of the financial and operational targets. All Share Awards will vest and entitle to one share each if 100 percent of the overall average performance is achieved. When calculating the overall performance achievement  individual targets may account for a maximum of 120 percent achievement  but the overall average performance is capped at 100 percent. If performance achievement falls below 80 percent for an individual target  this individual target accounts for zero in the calculation of the overall average achieved.The board of directors will present the rate of achievement of Performance Target 2 in the annual report for 2024.AllocationThe participants are divided into two allocation categories: (i) CEO and other members of group management; (ii) other personnel. The maximum number of Share Awards and Employee Stock Options that a participant may be granted in LTIP 2024 depends on the category to which the participant belongs.To ensure that the value of the share-based remuneration does not reach an unintended level in relation to other remuneration  the value of the Share Awards and Employee Stock Options granted to the CEO and group management must not  at the time of the grant  exceed a value equal to the person's current annual base salary. For other personnel the value must not exceed 33 percent of the annual base salary.The board of directors shall resolve upon the final allocation of the Share Awards and Employee Stock Options as soon as possible after the annual general meeting. Several factors will be considered in order to secure recruitment  retention and motivation when deciding upon individual allocations including position within Orexo  individual performance and total value of current remuneration package. Individual allocation cannot exceed the above-mentioned limit for the category that the individual belongs to. Out of the allocated Share Awards and Employee Stock Options  30 percent will constitute Share Awards and 70 percent will constitute Employee Stock Options.The share price that is to form the basis for calculating the number of Share Awards and Employee Stock Options is to correspond to the average last price paid during a given period of trading. This period comprises the first ten days of trading immediately following the date of the 2024 annual general meeting. The share price is then divided by the individual granting value in order to arrive at the total number of Share Awards and Employee Stock Options granted per participant.Preparation and administrationThe board of directors shall be responsible for preparing the detailed terms and conditions of LTIP 2024  in accordance with the mentioned terms and guidelines. To this end  the board of directors shall be entitled to make adjustments to meet foreign regulations or market conditions. The board of directors may also make other adjustments if significant changes in the Orexo group  or its operating environment  would result in a situation where the decided terms and conditions for LTIP 2024 no longer are appropriate. Prior to finally determining allotment of shares on the basis of Share Awards and Employee Stock Options  the board of directors will assess whether the outcome of LTIP 2024 is reasonable. This assessment will be conducted in relation to the company's financial earnings and position  conditions in the stock market and other circumstances. Should the board of directors not consider the outcome to be reasonable  the number of shares to be allotted will be reduced.Preparation of the proposalLTIP 2024 has been initiated by the board of directors of Orexo and has been structured in consultation with external advisers based on an evaluation of prior incentive programs and best market practices. LTIP 2024 has been prepared by the remuneration committee and reviewed at meetings of the board of directors.Scope and costs of the programLTIP 2024 will be accounted for in accordance with ""IFRS 2 - Share-based payments"". IFRS 2 stipulates that the Share Awards and Employee Stock Options should be expensed as personnel costs over the vesting period and will be accounted for directly against equity. Personnel costs in accordance with IFRS 2 do not affect the company's cash flow. Social security costs will be expensed in the income statement during the vesting period.Assuming a share price at the time of implementation of SEK 15.60   that Performance Target 1 is achieved and that Performance Target 2 is achieved at 50 percent  including a share price increase of 30 percent during the vesting period  the total cost for LTIP 2024 including social security costs is estimated to approximately SEK 27.0 million before tax. The corresponding total cost with full achievement of Performance Target 1 and Performance Target 2  including a share price increase of 60 percent during the vesting period  is estimated to approximately SEK 39.2 million before tax.LTIP 2024 will have marginal effects on Orexo's key ratios since delivery of shares shall be made by way of transfer of Orexo's repurchased shares as is described under section ""Delivery under LTIP 2024"" below.Since delivery of shares under LTIP 2024 shall be made by way of transfer of Orexo's repurchased shares  LTIP 2024 entails no dilution of the shareholding of the company. The maximum level of dilution for all other outstanding long-term incentive programs in the company amounts to 0 percent  since delivery of shares shall be made by way of transfer of Orexo's repurchased shares.Information on Orexo's existing incentive programs can be found in the 2023 annual report  note 10 and 24  as well as on the company's website www.orexo.com .Delivery under LTIP 2024The board of directors proposes that delivery of shares under LTIP 2024 shall be made by way of transfer of Orexo's repurchased shares. In addition  the board of directors proposes that delivery may also be satisfied through payment of a cash amount that is equal to the value of the Orexo share on the date of vesting less the applicable strike price for any Employee Stock Options.Resolution regarding adoption of new performance-based long-term incentive program LTIP Stay-on 2024 (item 21)The board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to implement a new performance-based long-term incentive program for certain Global Management Team ("" GMT "") employees and US Leadership Team ("" USLT "") employees within the Orexo group ("" LTIP Stay-on 2024 ""). LTIP Stay-on 2024 is proposed to include up to approximately 13 GMT and USLT employees within the Orexo group.LTIP Stay-on 2024 is a three-year performance-based program. Under LTIP Stay-on 2024  the participants will be granted  free of charge  (i) performance-based share awards ("" Share Awards "")  and (ii) performance-based employee stock options ("" Employee Stock Options "")  entitling to a maximum of 70 000 shares in Orexo  in accordance with the terms stipulated below. The Share Awards entitle to a maximum of 35 000 shares in Orexo and the Employee Stock Options entitle to a maximum of 35 000 shares in Orexo.The rationale for the proposalLTIP Stay-on 2024 substantially corresponds with the performance based long-term incentive program adopted at the annual general meeting 2023 (LTIP Stay-on 2023). LTIP Stay-on 2024 is intended for certain GMT and USLT employees within the Orexo group and qualification for participation in LTIP Stay-on 2024 is conditional upon the participant either keeping shares from allocations in Orexo's other on-going long-term incentive programs (the "" implemented LTIPs "") or investing in new Orexo shares with part of or the entire annual cash bonus of the participant. The board of directors of Orexo believes that an equity incentive program is an important part of a competitive remuneration package to be able to attract  retain and motivate qualified employees to the Orexo group. The board of directors further believes that LTIP Stay-on 2024 constitutes an important incentive for GMT and USLT employees to keep shares in the company. With reference thereto  the board of directors has decided to propose the adoption of a program corresponding to the program adopted at the annual general meeting 2023 (LTIP Stay-on 2023). LTIP Stay-on 2024 is based on performance-based Share Awards and Employee Stock Options and adapted to the current needs of the Orexo group.The purpose of LTIP Stay-on 2024 is to attract  retain and motivate employees of the Orexo group  provide a competitive remuneration package and to align the interests of GMT and USLT employees with the interests of the shareholders. The board of directors is of the opinion that this strengthens the interest for Orexo's business and also stimulates company loyalty in the future. In light of the above  the board of directors believes that the implementation of LTIP Stay-on 2024 will have a positive effect on the development of the Orexo group and consequently that LTIP Stay-on 2024 is beneficial to both the shareholders and the company.Conditions for Share Awards and Employee Stock OptionsThe following conditions shall apply for the Share Awards and the Employee Stock Options.- Qualification for participation in LTIP Stay-on 2024 is conditional upon the participant (i) keeping shares from allocations in any of Orexo's implemented LTIPs between 1 May 2024 and 31 July 2024 ("" Opt-in 1 "")  or (ii) investing in new Orexo shares with part of or the entire annual cash bonus of the participant between 1 February 2025 and 30 April 2025 ("" Opt-in 2 "").- Under Opt-in 1  the Share Awards and the Employee Stock Options shall be granted free of charge to the participants as soon as possible after 31 July 2024 and no later than on 31 August 2024 .- Under Opt-in 2  the Share Awards and the Employee Stock Options shall be granted free of charge to the participants as soon as possible after 30 April 2025 and no later than on 31 May 2025 .- Out of the granted Share Awards and Employee Stock Options  50 percent shall constitute Share Awards and 50 percent shall constitute Employee Stock Options. Every five (5) shares kept in accordance with Opt-in 1 and every five (5) shares acquired in accordance with Opt-in 2  respectively  entitle the participant to one (1) Share Award and one (1) Employee Stock Option.- Each Share Award entitles the holder to receive one share in the company  free of charge  except for the appropriate taxes  three years after the granting of the Share Award (the vesting period)  provided that the holder  with some exceptions  still is employed by the Orexo group.- Each Employee Stock Option entitles the holder to receive one share in the company upon payment of the strike price  three years after the granting of the Employee Stock Option (the vesting period)  provided that the holder  with some exceptions  still is employed by the Orexo group. The strike price shall be fixed to 100 percent of the volume-weighted average price for the Orexo share during the ten trading days preceding the date of the annual general meeting 2024.- A prerequisite for entitlement to receive shares on the basis of Share Awards is that Performance Targets 1 and/or 2 have been satisfied pursuant to the terms and conditions specified below.- A prerequisite for entitlement to receive shares on the basis of Employee Stock Options is that Performance Target 1 has been satisfied pursuant to the terms and conditions specified below.- The number of Share Awards and Employee Stock Options encompassed by LTIP Stay-on 2024 is to be re-calculated in the event that changes occur in Orexo's equity capital structure  such as a bonus issue  merger or consolidation of shares  new issue  reduction of the share capital or similar measures.- To make the participants' interest equal with the shareholders'  Orexo will compensate the participants for distributed dividends  if any  during the vesting period by increasing the number of shares that each Share Award and each Employee Stock Option  respectively  entitles to after the vesting period.- The Share Awards and the Employee Stock Options are non-transferable and may not be pledged.- The Share Awards and the Employee Stock Options can be granted by the parent company and any other company within the Orexo group.Performance ConditionsThe Share Awards are to be divided according to two different performance conditions encompassed by LTIP Stay-on 2024. The performance conditions focus on the holder still being employed by the Orexo group ("" Performance Target 1 "") and Orexo's financial and operational targets for 2024 ("" Performance Target 2 ""). Of each participant's granted Share Awards  50 percent will pertain to Performance Target 1 and up to 50 percent will pertain to Performance Target 2.The Employee Stock Options are to be divided according to one performance condition encompassed by LTIP Stay-on 2024  which is Performance Target 1. Of each participant's granted Employee Stock Options  100 percent will pertain to Performance Target 1  meaning that no Employee Stock Options will vest unless the performance target is met.The allotment of shares that each participant later may receive depends on achievement of the established performance targets as described below.Performance Target 1 (for Share Awards and Employee Stock Options) : This target pertains to the holder still being employed by the Orexo group upon vesting.Performance Target 2 (for Share Awards) : This target pertains to the fulfilment of the financial and operational targets for the financial year 2024 as established by the board of directors and relates to Orexo's key KPIs as for example revenue  profitability and achieved milestones  etc. Performance achievement of individual targets is weighted into an overall average performance achievement. The outcome will be measured lineally; meaning that from zero to 100 percent of the Share Awards will vest depending on the overall average rate of performance of the financial and operational targets. All Share Awards will vest and entitle to one share each if 100 percent of the overall average performance is achieved. When calculating the overall performance achievement  individual targets may account for a maximum of 120 percent achievement  but the overall average performance is capped at 100 percent. If performance achievement falls below 80 percent for an individual target  this individual target accounts for zero in the calculation of the overall average achieved.The board of directors will present the rate of achievement of Performance Target 2 in the Annual Report for 2024.AllocationEvery five (5) shares kept in accordance with Opt-in 1 and every five (5) shares acquired in accordance with Opt-in 2  respectively  entitle the participants of LTIP Stay-on 2024 to one (1) Share Award and one (1) Employee Stock Option. Out of the allocated Share Awards and Employee Stock Options  50 percent will constitute Share Awards and 50 percent will constitute Employee Stock Options.In relation to allocation under Opt-in 1  the board of directors shall resolve upon the final allocation of the Share Awards and Employee Stock Options as soon as possible after 31 July 2024 . In relation to allocation under Opt-in 2  the board of directors shall resolve upon the final allocation of the Share Awards and Employee Stock Options as soon as possible after 30 April 2025 .Preparation and administrationThe board of directors shall be responsible for preparing the detailed terms and conditions of LTIP Stay-on 2024  in accordance with the mentioned terms and guidelines. To this end  the board of directors shall be entitled to make adjustments to meet foreign regulations or market conditions. The board of directors may also make other adjustments if significant changes in the Orexo group  or its operating environment  would result in a situation where the decided terms and conditions for LTIP Stay-on 2024 no longer are appropriate.

The corresponding total cost with full achievement of Performance Target 1 and Performance Target 2  including a share price increase of 60 percent during the vesting period  is estimated to approximately SEK 1.2 million before tax.LTIP Stay-on 2024 will have marginal effects on Orexo's key ratios since delivery of shares shall be made by way of transfer of Orexo's repurchased shares as is described under section ""Delivery under LTIP Stay-on 2024"" below.Since delivery of shares under LTIP Stay-on 2024 shall be made by way of transfer of Orexo's repurchased shares  LTIP Stay-on 2024 entails no dilution of the shareholding of the company.

For the avoidance of doubt  UCB SA/NV confirms that it covers all its obligations under the LTI Plans with existing shares  i.e. through share buybacks  so there is no dilution for existing shareholders of UCB SA/NV.Proposed resolution:The General Meeting approves the decision of the Board of Directors to allocate an estimated number of 1 565 000 free shares:a)of which an estimated number of 1 345 000 shares to eligible employees under the Long-Term Inventive policy (LTI policy)  namely to approximately 3 000 individuals  according to the applicable allocation criteria. These free shares will only vest if and when the eligible employees are still employed within the UCB Group three years after the grant of the awards;b)of which an estimated number of 220 000 shares to eligible employees under the Performance Share Plan  namely to approximately 160 individuals  according to the applicable allocation criteria. These free shares will be delivered after a three-year vesting period and the number of shares actually allocated will vary from 0% to 150% of the number of shares initially granted depending on the level of achievement of the performance conditions set by the Board of Directors of UCB SA/NV at the moment of grant.The estimated figures under a) and b) do not take into account employees hired or promoted to eligible levels between 1 January 2024 and 1 April 2024.12. Change of control provisions in contracts or funding agreements - art. 7:151 of the BCCAPursuant to article 7:151 of the BCCA  the General Meeting is solely competent to approve so-called ‘change of control’ clauses  i.e.  provisions whereby third parties are granted rights having a substantial influence on the assets of the Company or causing a substantial debt or liability for the Company  if the exercise of such rights depends on the launch of a public takeover bid on the shares of the Company or a change of control thereof. These clauses are standard requests from our creditors and/or in the legal documentation of our financing arrangements.12.1 EMTN Program – renewalUCB SA/NV has entered into a Euro Medium Term Note Program dated 6 March 2013 for an amount of EUR 5 000 000 000  with last update of the Base Prospectus on 17 October 2023  as this program may be further amended  extended or updated from time to time (the “EMTN Program”).

In accordance with said article 7:151 of the BCCA  this clause must be approved by the General Meeting and it is hereby proposed to renew this approval for any series of notes issued under the EMTN Program including such clause during the next 12 months.Proposed resolution:Pursuant to article 7:151 of the Belgian Code of Companies and Associations  the General Meeting renews its approval: (i) of condition 5 (e) (i) of the Terms and Conditions of the EMTN Program (Redemption at the Option of Noteholders – Upon a Change of Control (Change of Control Put))  in respect of any series of notes to which such condition is made applicable being issued under the Program from 26 April 2024 until 24 April 2025  under which any and all of the holders of the relevant notes can  in certain circumstances when a Change of Control at the level of UCB SA/NV occurs  require UCB SA/NV to redeem that note on the Change of Control Put Date at the Put Redemption Amount together  if applicable  with interest accrued to such Change of Control Put Date  following a Change of Control of UCB SA/NV; and (ii) of any other provision of the EMTN Program or notes issued under the EMTN Program granting rights to third parties which could affect an obligation on UCB SA/NV where in each case the exercise of these rights is dependent on the occurrence of a Change of Control.12.2 Schuldschein loan agreement entered into on 24 August 2023UCB SA/NV has entered into a Schuldschein loan agreement  in the amount of EUR 30 million  between  UCB SA/NV as borrower  and amongst others  ING Bank  a branch of ING-DIBA AG as original lender  dated 24 August 2023  including a clause (Article 5 b) under which any and all of the lenders can  in certain circumstances  cancel their commitments and require repayment of their participations in the loans  together with accrued interests and all other amounts accrued and outstanding thereunder  following a change of control of UCB SA/NV.Proposed resolution:Pursuant to article 7:151 of the Belgian Code of the Companies and Associations  the General Meeting approves Article 5 b) of the Schuldschein loan agreement in the amount of EUR 30 million  entered into between  UCB SA/NV as borrower  and amongst others  ING Bank  a branch of ING-DIBA AG as Original Lender  dated 24 August 2023  under which this Schuldschein loan agreement  together with accrued interests and all other amounts accrued and outstanding thereunder  could in certain circumstances become immediately due and payable  at the discretion of any and all of the lenders following a change of control of UCB SA/NV.EXTRAORDINARY PART (Extraordinary General Meeting)The Extraordinary General Meeting will only validly deliberate on the items on its agenda if at least half of the capital is present or represented  in accordance with article 7:153 of the BCCA.

(the ""Company"")  a shell company incorporated under the laws of the Cayman Islands as an exempted company with limited liability and listed on Euronext Amsterdam  the regulated market operated by Euronext Amsterdam N.V.  announces that on 21 February 2024 it entered into a term sheet (the ""Terms"") with Arkon Energy Ohio LLC (now Arkon Energy US Holdco LLC) (""Arkon"") relating to a potential transaction  including a business combination  with Arkon or an entity to be formed by it or its members for such purpose (the ""Potential Business Combination"").While the Terms are generally indicative and non-binding on the parties  it does include certain binding terms including a 90-day mutual exclusivity period  during which the parties have agreed to work towards executing definitive agreements in respect of the Potential Business Combination. The Potential Business Combination is subject to certain pre-conditions including the completion of satisfactory due diligence by each party  respective board approvals  completion of definitive agreements  and the successful completion of a convertible debt capital raise process.Arkon is a Bitcoin data center infrastructure and mining business  that buys  develops  and owns valuable data center infrastructure at the intersection of electricity and data processing at an industrial scale that help power the trillion-dollar Bitcoin economy. Arkon currently has 117 megawatts (""MW"") of approved operating capacity across two data centers  including a 95MW flagship facility in Hannibal  Ohio  and a 22MW facility in Hopedale  Ohio. In addition  Arkon has binding agreements securing and entitling it to develop more sites in the United States  which would enable the Company to increase capacity by a further 190MW  bringing its total operating capacity to 307MW subject to successful funding and development of the sites. Arkon has signed a letter of intent to acquire an additional 100MW of further pipeline capacity within these same sites.Arkon's business model is essentially based on two verticals: (i) hosting third-party Bitcoin mining machines  and (ii) self-mining Bitcoin with its own machines. The business model is based on the ownership and management of the underlying infrastructure that powers the machines  designed to enable flexibility in balancing both verticals while taking advantage of the current tailwinds in the Bitcoin ecosystem.The convertible debt capital raise would primarily be used to fund the infrastructure capital necessary to increase operating capacity to up to 307MW within the next nine months  including purchasing the latest generation mining machines  as well as refinancing an existing debt facility.The parties intend to simultaneously close the Potential Business Combination and the convertible debt raise. Subject to such closing  the combined Company intends to issue additional common shares listed on Euronext Amsterdam at the earliest opportunity.The discussions are ongoing and there is no certainty as to whether the parties will enter into definitive agreements regarding the Potential Business Combination  nor as to the terms of any such business combination.Further announcements will be made as and when appropriate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.IMPORTANT INFORMATIONThis press release may contain information that qualifies or may have qualified as inside information within the meaning of Article 7(1) of the EU Market Abuse Regulation.ENQUIRIESBM3EAC Corp.c/o Brigade Capital Management  LP",neutral,0.02,0.98,0.01,negative,0.05,0.47,0.49,True,English,"['Press Release', 'Term Sheet', 'Arkon Energy', 'BM3EAC', 'March', '09:15', 'convertible debt capital raise process', 'Arkon Energy US Holdco LLC', '90-day mutual exclusivity period', 'EU Market Abuse Regulation', 'valuable data center infrastructure', 'latest generation mining machines', 'Bitcoin data center infrastructure', 'Euronext Amsterdam N.V.', 'third-party Bitcoin mining machines', 'Arkon Energy Ohio LLC', 'convertible debt raise', 'BM3EAC Corp.

Reasons for requesting Authorisation to purchase and dispose of treasury shares The Authorisation to purchase and dispose of treasury shares  is requested in order to meet strategic and operational flexibility requirements  which allows for the following: providing the Company with the necessary funds for payment in the context of corporate and/or financial transactions of an extraordinary nature  so that treasury shares in the portfolio can be used as a means of payment (or possibly as a guarantee) in transactions of an extraordinary nature such as  by way of example but not limited to  mergers and divestments  to receive the necessary funds for acquisition projects  and/or in the context of transactions of exchange and/or sale of share packages and/or for the conclusion of commercial and/or strategic alliances or for other uses deemed to be of financial and/or management interest for the Company;using treasury shares  either purchased or already in the portfolio  for the exercise of rights  including conversion rights  deriving from financial instruments issued by the Company;disposing of treasury shares in relation to compensation plans based on financial instruments pursuant to Article 114- bis of the TUF as approved by the Shareholders' Meeting  and/or to plans for the free assignment of shares to Shareholders;114- of the TUF as approved by the Shareholders' Meeting  and/or to plans for the free assignment of shares to Shareholders; intervening in the market  directly or through intermediaries  in compliance with the provisions in force  in an attempt to improve the liquidity of the security by carrying out activities to support it  without prejudice to the equal treatment of Shareholders  especially in the presence of excessive volatility;investing  directly or through intermediaries  in an optimal form and with a medium- and long-term view  the company's liquid assets  also for the purpose of establishing long-term shareholdings and regularising the performance of the share price in accordance with the provisions in force. Maximum number  category and nominal value of the shares to which the Authorisation refers As of today  the Company's share capital consists of 31 809 451 ordinary shares  all with a nominal value of Euro 1 each.In this regard  it is proposed that the Shareholders' Meeting authorises  pursuant to Article 2357 et seq. of the Italian Civil Code  the purchase  in one or more instalments of a number of ordinary shares not exceeding one fifth of the share capital  taking into account the treasury shares already held in portfolio. Considering that 20% of the share capital is represented by 6 361 890 ordinary shares and that  as at the date of approval of this Report  the Company already holds no. 2 580 102 treasury shares  equal to approximately 8 11% of the share capital  the Company has the right to purchase an additional maximum number of 3 781 788 ordinary shares corresponding to approximately 11 89% of the share capital.The Authorisation submitted to the Shareholders' Meeting also includes the power to subsequently dispose of all or part of the treasury shares in portfolio  including in several instalments  even before the maximum number of shares that may be purchased has been reached. Additional information useful for a full assessment of compliance with the provision set forth in Article 2357  paragraph 3 of the Italian Civil Code.It should be noted that none of the Company's subsidiaries owns Servizi Italia S.p.A. shares and that in any case  at any time  the maximum number of treasury shares held  also taking into account any sharesthat may be held by subsidiaries  shall never exceed one fifth of the share capital. This limit refers to all treasury shares held by the Company in its portfolio including  therefore  purchases made under previous resolutions and the Company's shares held by its subsidiaries. In this regard  subsidiaries will be given specific instructions to promptly report any acquisition of treasury shares  pursuant to Article 2359-bis of the Italian Civil Code. The number of treasury shares that can be purchased within the limits set in Article 2357  paragraphs 1 and 3 of the Italian Civil Code will also be based on the purchase price  to the extent that the same can be found in the distributable profits and in the available reserves resulting from the last duly approved financial statements. The Board of Directors shall verify compliance with the provisions of Article 2357  paragraphs 1 and 3 of the Civil Code when making each authorised purchase. The Board of Directors highlights the need to create  at the same time as the purchase  an unavailable reserve in an amount equal to the own shares recorded in the assets of the balance sheet  pursuant to Article 2357-ter  paragraph 3 of the Italian Civil Code (the ""Reserve for Treasury Shares in Portfolio"")  taking this amount from the available extraordinary reserve. In the event of a subsequent transfer  exchange  contribution  cancellation or write-down of the carrying value of treasury shares being acquired  the Reserve for Treasury Shares in Portfolio shall revert to the available extraordinary reserve  for a value equal to the carrying value of the treasury shares being transferred  exchanged  contributed  cancelled or written down. Requested duration of the Authorisation The Authorisation to purchase is requested for the maximum duration permitted by Article 2357  paragraph 2 of the Civil Code  i.e. for a period of 18 months from the date on which the Shareholders' Meeting adopts the relevant Authorisation resolution. As regards the disposal of treasury shares already in the portfolio and those that will be purchased in accordance with the purposes described above  it is hereby proposed that the Shareholders' Meeting does not set a time limit  in light of the fact that there are currently no regulatory constraints in this regard and in light of an advised maximum flexibility  including in terms of time  for the disposal of such shares  leaving the Board of Directors free to carry out authorised transactions once or more at any time. Minimum and maximum price and market valuation on the basis of which they were determined 5.1) The purchase of treasury shares must be carried out on the market  in compliance with the applicable laws and regulations:• at a minimum purchase price not lower than 20% of the weighted average of the official prices of the shares recorded by Euronext Milan in the three days preceding each individual transaction (or the announcement of the transaction  depending on the technical procedures identified by the Board of Directors);• at a maximum purchase price not exceeding 20% of the weighted average of the official prices of the shares recorded by Euronext Milan in the three days preceding each individual transaction (or the announcement of the transaction  depending on the technical procedures identified by the Board of Directors).For purchases made on the market  however  the additional conditions set out in Article 3 of the Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/1052 shall apply in terms of purchase prices. In particular  with regard to the definition of volumes and unit prices  purchases will be made  in accordance with the conditions laid down in the aforementioned article  namely:shares shall not be purchased at a price exceeding the higher price between the last independent transaction and the price of the highest current independent purchase offer on the purchase market;the daily purchase quantities shall not exceed 25% of the average daily trading volume of Servizi Italia S.p.A.'s shares. The daily volume shall be calculated on the basis of the average daily trading volume during one of the following periods: during the month preceding the month in which the market is notified of the average daily volume of shares to be purchased. This volume will be fixed and shall apply throughout the duration of the plan; in the 20 trading days preceding the date of purchase  when the volume is not indicated in the plan; Treasury shares in the portfolio may be disposed of as follows: by sale on the stock exchange or in blocks  including in accordance with private negotiations. In such cases  the following limits will be observed: the minimum sale price shall not be lower than 20% of the weighted average of the official prices of the shares recorded on the market of Euronext Milan in the three days preceding each individual transaction and  in any case  in compliance with the laws and regulations in force;the maximum sale price may not exceed 20% of the weighted average of the official prices of the shares recorded by Euronext Milan in the three days preceding each individual transaction and  in any case  in compliance with the laws and regulations in force; in terms of the price for the purchase of shareholdings or companies; in such cases  these disposals may be carried out at a consideration which may not be less than 15% of the arithmetical average of the official price recorded by the security during the 90 days preceding the date of disposal; the price of the disposal  if the sale is carried out for a cash consideration  may not be less than 90% of the weighted average purchase price and  in any event  may not be less than the lower of the purchase prices.These price limits may be waived both in the case of exchanges or transfers of treasury shares (or the provision of guarantees on them) as part of the implementation of transactions concerning business and/or commercial projects and/or in any case of interest to the Issuer or the Group  and in the case of the assignment and/or transfer  for consideration or free of charge  of shares or options on them in relation to (i) compensation plans based on financial instruments pursuant to Article 114- bis of the Consolidated Law on Finance TUF (in favour  inter alia  of directors  employees  collaborators  agents and consultants of the Company)  and/or (ii) the issue of financial instruments convertible into shares and/or (iii) programmes for the free assignment of shares to Shareholders and/or (iv) a public sale or exchange offer.Disposal transactions shall be accounted for in accordance with the applicable legal provisions and accounting principles. Methods applied to purchases and disposals Purchase transactions shall  in any case  be carried out in compliance with Articles 2357 et seq. of the Italian Civil Code  Article 5 of EU Regulation No. 596/2014 (""Market Abuse Regulation""  hereinafter ""MAR"")  Article 132 of the CFA  Article 144-bis of the Issuer Regulation  accepted market practices and the guidelines adopted by the Supervisory Authority from time to time  and therefore  inter alia: by means of a public purchase or exchange offer  or (ii) on the market or  where applicable  on multilateral trading systems  in accordance with the operating procedures established by the market management company that do not allow the direct matching of trading proposals for purchase with predetermined trading proposals for sale  or (iii) by the purchase and sale  in compliance with current regulatory provisions  of derivative instruments traded on regulated markets or  where applicable  on multilateral trading systems that provide for the physical delivery of the underlying shares  or (iv) bythe allocation to Shareholders  in proportion to the shares they hold  of a put option to be exercised under the terms identified by the Board of Directors within a maximum period of 18 (eighteen) months from the date on which the Shareholders' Meeting adopts the corresponding resolution  or (v) in the manner established by market practices permitted by CONSOB pursuant to Article 13 of the MAR and/or by the guidelines adopted by the Supervisory Authority applicable from time to time  and in any case in such a way as to ensure equal treatment between Shareholders and compliance with all applicable rules  including European rules (and  in particular  the regulatory technical standards adopted in implementation of the MAR). Treasury shares may be purchased in other ways than those indicated above where permitted in accordance with the regulations in force from time to time and/or the guidelines of the Supervisory Authority  taking into account the need to comply with the principle of equal treatment of shareholders in all cases. The shares to be acquired in execution of the shareholders' Authorisation may be subject to disposal and  in this context  may also be sold  even before having reached the maximum number of purchases covered by this authorisation  on one or more occasions  without time limits  in the manner deemed most appropriate by the Company  including  by way of example  a sale on the stock exchange and/or over the counter and/or on the block market  by means of an institutional placement  as consideration for equity investments and/or companies  as well as based on the execution of agreements with strategic partners and in any case under any other form of disposal permitted by the relevant regulations in force  including the public offer for sale or exchange and the assignment and/or transfer  for consideration or free of charge  of shares or related options in accordance with (i) the compensation plans based on financial instruments pursuant to Article 114-bis of the TUF  (ii) the issue of financial instruments convertible into shares and (iii) the plans for the free assignment of shares to Shareholders. Involvement of the purchase of treasury shares in the reduction of the share capital It should be noted that the request for Authorisation to purchase treasury shares is not  at present  aimed at operations to reduce the share capital by cancelling treasury shares purchased in accordance with the purposes of paragraph 2 of Article 5 of the MAR. Trading in treasury shares  in the context of buyback plans  shall comply with the conditions set out in Article 5 of the MAR  Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/1052 and/or be carried out in accordance with the market practices permitted by Consob pursuant to Article 13 of the MAR and/or the guidelines of the Supervisory Authority  so as to benefit  where applicable  from the protection provided by MAR or the permitted market practices. The treasury share buyback plan shall be coordinated by an investment entity that will make the negotiation decisions on when to purchase Servizi Italia S.p.A. in full independence from the latter  within the limits granted by the authorisation submitted for approval by the Shareholders' Meeting.

APPROVES THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE DRAFT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF 31 DECEMBER 2023 Value of Production up by +9.2%  almost entirely (92.8%) due to organic growth The Group is adapting its structure to seize all future growth opportunities  both in Italy and abroad Management strongly involved in positioning Ecomembrane as an international leader in the gas storage and containment sector Ordinary dividend proposal of €0.05 per share MAIN RESULTS 2023 Value of production : €15.6 million (+9.2% YoY): €15.6 million (+9.2% YoY) EBITDA : €2 million (-36.6%* YoY) compared to pro-forma 2022 figures to retroactively reflect the accounting effects of the demerger of the real estate division Result for the year: €1.2 million (-33.2%* YoY) compared to pro-forma 2022 figures to retroactively reflect the accounting effects of the demerger of the real estate division Shareholders' equity: €14.9 millionNet financial position: positive in the amount of €5.8 million (Liquid Assets of €7.5 million and Financial Debts of €1.7 million) Gadesco Pieve Delmona (CR)  22 March 2024 - The Board of Directors of Ecomembrane S.p.A.  (ISIN IT0005543332)  a leading company in the design and creation of gas storage and containment systems for the production of green energy  listed on the EGM segment of Borsa Italiana S.p.A.  hereby reports that it has approved the consolidated financial statements and the draft financial statements as of 31 December 2023. Lorenzo Spedini  CEO of Ecomembrane  declared: ""2023 was a crucial year for Ecomembrane  with events that radically changed its dimension  including the company's listing on the Euronext Growth Milan market and the activity aimed at completing the new production plant and the steel processing plant  which is already yielding excellent results in terms of efficiency and cost optimisation. The company also carried out two M&A transactions and acquired a majority stake in SBS SOLAR  which will allow Ecomembrane to improve its offer in the renewable energy sector. All these transactions required strong management involvement and had a positive impact on the volume of business which grew by around 9%  while the operating results reflect the adjustment of overhead costs to the expected growth in business volume over the next few years. The necessary strengthening of the structure is intended to enable the Group to fully seize all the expected growth opportunities  not only in the biomethane sector but also in the other business lines related to CO2 storage and Hydrogen."" MAIN CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL RESULTS AS AT 31 DECEMBER 2023 The Value of Production was €15.626 million  9.2% up on last year's figure of €14.310 million. This growth is 92.8% organic in nature  as the contribution of Splash  included in the consolidation scope only as of 2 October 2023  is insignificant due to the seasonality of the swimming pool business  where sales are extremely low in the latter part of the year. The 2023 figures and the increase in business volume do not yet benefit from the supply of plants incentivised as a result of the Biomethane Decree  the first ranking of which was only published last July and which has seen several operators withdraw in order to participate in the next competitive procedures  benefiting from a higher tariff; there have also been delays in accessing incentives in the United States due to the Inflation Reduction Act. Nevertheless  the value of production increased  driven by the parent company's results  particularly in odour control covers  service and installation activities  and CO2 storage supplies. 55% of sales for the period were made in Italy  20% in the USA  12% in the EU and 13% in the rest of the world. The incidence of the cost of raw and ancillary materials is 42% of ""revenues from sales and services""  compared to 40.1% in the previous year  mainly due to the higher incidence on revenues of odour control covers  which have a lower margin than heat shields and gasholders. EBITDA was €2.041 million  lower than the €3.222 million (pro-forma) of the previous year due to the adjustment of overhead costs involved in strengthening structures to allow the Group to fully seize all growth opportunities expected in the coming years. Pro-forma2022 data retroactively reflect the accounting effects of the demerger of the real estate branch. Costs for services  amounting to €3.464 million  include  among others: work entrusted to third parties for the completion of installations  insurance  energy costs  professional advice and maintenance costs; personnel costs amounted to €3.314 million and reflect new hires in the period  in line with the envisaged plan to strengthen the structure. Specifically  during 2023  seven new resources were recruited  including: 1 x CFO-Investor Relator  1 x Project Management Manager and 2 x Engineers  one of them responsible for Service activities. As of the date of this press release  personnel had further increased with the hiring of new resources  bringing the total workforce of the parent company to 55  plus a further 20 employees gained through Splash and a new US sales manager  which demonstrates a significant and dynamic recruiting activity. Tangible and intangible depreciation amounted to a total €990 000  compared to €471 000 (pro forma) last year. In particular  intangible depreciation during the period under analysis was affectedby the capitalisation of costs related to the listing on the EGM market and the depreciation of R&D costs. Two self-propelledwelding machines purchased to support the production automation process also began to be depreciated among tangible assets during the period. The financial result includes the capital gain from the sale of the Alvus/Favus shares for €562 000. In light of the above  the profit for the year after taxes was €1.175 million. The net financial debt presented an overall positive balance of €5.776 million as the Liquid Assets  amounting to €7.476 million  were higher than the debts owed to banks which  in turn  had fallen to €1.550 million  from €2.510 million on 31 December 2022 Pro-Forma. The main reason for the change in net financial debt compared to 31 December 2022 figures was the capital collected at the time of listing  net of the relative costs. Shareholders' equity  including the result for the year  was €14.883 million  compared to a Pro- Forma Shareholders' Equity at 31 December 2022 of €2.757 million. The increase  net of the result for the period  was essentially attributable to subscription of the capital increase at the time of listing. MAIN FINANCIAL RESULTS OF ECOMEMBRANE S.P.A. AS AT 31 DECEMBER 2023 The Value of Production was €13.132 million  11% up on the data for 2022 of €11.858 million. EBITDA was €1.197 million  compared to €1.935 million (pro-forma) in 2022. As already mentioned for the consolidated financial statements  the different margins are attributable to an adjustment of structural costs necessary to cope with the new size expected in the coming years. The result for the year after taxes was €1.175 million  in line with the previous year  also due to the capital gain from the sale of the Alvus/Favus shares  which contributed €562 000. PROPOSED ALLOCATION OF PROFIT FOR THE YEAR Ecomembrane's financial statements as at 31 December 2023 recorded a profit of €1 175 370. The Board of Directors resolved to propose to the Shareholders' Meeting that the profit be allocated as follows: €214 705.85 to the distribution of dividends;€960 664.15 to reserves. DIVIDENDS The Company's Board of Directors resolved to submit a proposal to the Shareholders' Meeting to be convened for a dividend distribution of €0.05 per eligible share (for a maximum total of €214 705.85)  with an ex-dividend date of 6 June 2024  a record date of 7 June 2024 and a dividend payment date of 8 June 2024.MAIN SIGNIFICANT EVENTS DURING THE FIRST HALF OF 2023 With a view to reorganising the company and changing the way its assets are managed  by notarised deed dated 29 March 2023  registered with the Company Register of Cremona on 31 March 2023  a partial  proportional demerger took place  as a result of which the assets relating to the Company's entire real estate component were transferred to the newly incorporated beneficiary Mondo Verde S.r.l.. Bearing in mind that on 31 December 2022 the book equity of Ecomembrane amounted to a total of €3.4 million  as a result of the demerger the Beneficiary was transferred assets with a net book value of €1.6 million. 2023 was a turning point for Ecomembrane. Following the shareholders' meeting resolution of 5 April 2023  the Company was transformed from its previous form as a limited liability company to that of a joint-stockcompany  with the consequent adoption of new articles of association  a new company name and a share capital adjustment with a free capital increase using the available reserves. Also on 5 April 2023  the Shareholders' Meeting approved the plan to admit Company shares to trading on the Euronext Growth Milan market  also approving new articles of association effective from admission to trading. On 26 April  the Company received permission from Borsa Italiana to trade ordinary shares on the Euronext Growth Milan market and trading started on 28 April 2023. The transaction involved 1 758 800 ordinary shares  including 1 294 117 ordinary shares from the capital increase  235 294 put up for sale by Lorenzo Spedini and 229 389 ordinary shares subject to the over-allotment option  for a total countervalue of around €15 million. On 16 May 2023  the Company notified that - as the Examination stage had ended positively - the Italian Patent and Trademarks Office (U.I.B.M.) of Rome had notified the granting of the patent called: ""Pneumatic Gasholder with membrane for the storage of low-pressuregassy hydrogen"". Thanks to that patent  Ecomembrane can now create systems able to store low pressure hydrogen produced from renewable sources  considerably reducing the costs of managing the hydrogen itself. The gasholder created thanks to this new patent will  in fact  lower energy consumption for storage  making hydrogen cheaper and easier to use as a green energy processing source. Moreover  the patent envisages a number of technical solutions that raise the safety level for storage of the hydrogen itself. On 27 June 2023  the Company announced that it had received a €1.6 million order to supply the parts to build a CO2 storage gasholder to be delivered in the current year. The customer is an innovative Italian company that has developed a pioneering technology whereby the CO2 stored in the gasholder is used to generate clean energy in the hours when solar power is not available. The system uses carbon dioxide stored in the gasholder as a fluid to store energy using pressure peaks. On 9 August 2023  the Company announced that it had signed a preliminary purchase and sale agreement with VORN Bioenergy GmbH  a German company that develops  builds and manages biomethane projects  with registered office in Regensburg  along with other sellers  relating to: the shares held by Ecomembrane in the share capital of Alvus S.r.l and Favus S.r.l.  equal in both cases to 18.9466% of the same. Alvus  together with its associate Favus  operates in the project development of plants for the production of gas from renewable sources.The shareholdings in Alvus and Favus were recorded in the Company's balance sheet for a total amount of €203 000 and the sale of their shares  for approximately €765 000  resulted in a capital gain of €562 000. The transaction was finalised  on the same terms  on 12 October. On 21 September 2023  the Company announced that it had signed an agreement with Little Rock Holdings  Inc  through its subsidiary Ecomembrane LLC  to purchase 100% of the shares in Splash SuperPools Ltd.  a US company with registered office in Little Rock  Arkansas  operating in the treatment and production of PVC membranes for pools and biogas plants  for USD 2.3 million. The same company was already a partner of Ecomembrane LLC through a service contract whereby  for a monthly fee  it supplied the latter with the resources and facilities needed to operate in the US market. The purchase of Splash  financed with part of the funds collected through the IPO  enabled Ecomembrane to reorganise and consolidate its presence and positioning in the US market  which is expected to grow considerably. The transaction was finalised  on the same terms  on 2 October. MAIN SIGNIFICANT EVENTS AFTER THE END OF 2023 On 1 March 2024  the Company's Board of Directors approved the acquisition of 25% of SBS Solar S.r.l.  now controlled by Ecomembrane with a total stake of 55%  and the related contractual arrangements. The transaction was finalised with: (i) the agreement to purchase shares from the selling shareholders Luigi Spedini and Michele Bonetti forming 35% of the share capital  for a price equal to the nominal value of such shares  amounting to €10 500  (ii) the shareholders' agreement with the minority shareholders for the corporate governance of SBS (iii) the put&call agreement on the residual shares of the minority shareholders of SBS  (iv) the letter appointing Luigi Spedini as CEO of SBS  (v) the letter of commitment of minority shareholders Luigi Spedini and Michele Bonetti for the subordinated and postponed repayment of the shareholder loans granted by them to SBS. The put&call agreement concerns the right of the minority shareholders to sell to Ecomembrane their shareholdings in SBS from  alternatively  the third year or the fifth year following the date of signature of the Sale and Purchase Agreement (""SPA"")  as well as the right of Ecomembrane to purchase from the minority shareholders  from the fifth year following the date of signature of the ""SPA""  the shareholdings held by them in SBS. The consideration for the exercise of these options will be determined on the basis of an appraisal commissioned from a leading investment bank or independent consulting firm and will be paid  at Ecomembrane's discretion  either in cash or by swapping Ecomembrane shares. In the event of a swap  the Ecomembrane shares will be valued on the basis of the average stock market price on the last 90 days prior to the options being exercised. OUTLOOK FOR OPERATIONS Ecomembrane continues its consolidation path aimed at strengthening its market position and becoming one of the leading international players in the gas storage and containment sector. During the course of 2024  business volume is expected to grow in Italy  driven by the forthcomingtenders related to the Biomethane Decree  and in the EU and US by the funds available under the REPowerEU and the Inflation Reduction Act respectively; further developments are also expected in the CO2 storage and Hydrogen segments. In the CCS (CarbonCapture&Storage) area  i.e. the process of capturing carbon dioxide produced in industrial processes and its subsequent storage underground  used to prevent the release of greenhouse gas into the atmosphere by production sectors where these emissions are difficult to eliminate (the so-called""hard-to-abate"" emissions)  and in line with the evolution of the European regulatory framework  several EU member states have also established a series of strategies and tools to foster its development  including: Denmark  Germany and the Netherlands. With regard to hydrogen  the technology has developed steadily in recent years  as witnessed by managers attending international trade fairs and holding discussions with important industry players. In order to meet the growth expectations  the Group will continue the campaign of hiring new employees  especially in the technical and production area  as it did during 2023 and in the first few months of 2024  as a result of which the workforce has grown to 56 resources  in addition to the 20 employees gained through Splash. Of particular note is the hiring of two sales managers in the US and France  respectively  to strengthen the commercial presence in these markets. In addition  investments will continue to be made in new product R&D  as the Company has historically done in recent years  starting up the new production plant in Vescovato and the mechanical workshop  which are expected to bring significant efficiencies to the production process. SBS Solar  a company founded in 2021 to develop  design and build turnkey Solar Belt plants  benefiting therefore from simplified authorisation procedures  and specialising in the field of industrial and agro-voltaicsingle-axis trackers  will also enter the consolidation scope in 2024. Although it is a young and newly-established company  it relies on the technology and 20-year track record of its founding partners  Luigi Spedini and Michele Bonetti  who have brought to the company the know-how they gained from previous experience  in Italy and abroad  in the construction and management of utility-scalesingle-axis tracker plants (so-called because they follow the sun along a single horizontal or vertical rotation axis  being able to rotate in an east-west or north-south direction  offering a considerable improvement in performance compared to fixed systems). This acquisition will allow Ecomembrane to expand its offer in the field of renewable energies  with the opportunity to exploit potential commercial and distribution synergies in the future. **** Convocation of shareholders' meeting and proposal to purchase own shares CONVOCATION OF THE SHAREHOLDERS' MEETING The Board of Directors resolved to convene the Ordinary Shareholders' Meeting on first call on 23 April 2024 and  if necessary  on second call on 24 April 2024  at the times and places communicated in the relevant call notice that will be published in accordance with the law and the Articles of Association.

DGB reports a +44.3% Year-On-Year growth in payments received for carbon credits …,"DGB Group N.V. (""DGB""  ""the Group""  or ""the Company"") (Euronext: DGB: NL000916951)  a leading carbon project developer and ecosystem restoration company  published its unaudited annual report for the financial year 2023 (the ""Annual Report""). DGB reports a +44.3% Year-On-Year (""YoY"") growth in payments received for carbon credits and a surge of €23.67million in DGB's project pipeline value  highlighting DGB's substantial progress in the rapidly evolving carbon marketplace and its unwavering commitment to nature conservation and biodiversity.Key highlights from the Annual Report include:Financial performance: DGB experienced significant growth in forward carbon credit sales  improving by €0.5 million compared to the previous year. This signifies increased demand for verified carbon credits and carbon offset projects. In total  €1.6 million in payments were received for carbon credits (+44.3% YoY growth).Expanding project portfolio: In 2023  DGB effectively developed and managed multiple large-scale verified carbon projects and started new biodiversity and plastic project pilots. DGB now has seven advanced-stage projects under management and twelve more in feasibility stages  which are set up on the framework of leading verification standards. A €23.67 million increase in DGB's project value led to a total DGB asset value of €29.1 million.Strategic partnerships: DGB established new partnerships with governments  businesses  and individuals  solidifying its standing as a reliable partner in the carbon market. The Company now cooperates with stakeholders in the Republic of Côte d'Ivoire  the Democratic Republic of the Congo  Etiopia  Cameroon  Uganda  and Kenya  broadening its project influence.Industry recognition and commitment to ESG: DGB earned recognition for its contributions to the carbon marketplace and nature conservation  further establishing itself as a purpose-driven  boots-on-the-ground organisation with a strong global workforce and tangible environmental impact. The Company continues to operate responsibly and generate long-term value for stakeholders  offering services ranging from initial outreach to advanced ESG strategy consultancy.Reflecting on DGB's performance last year  the CEO  Selwyn Duijvestijn  remarked  ""2023 marked another year of financial and operational growth for us. We witnessed our forward carbon credit sales surge to €1.6 million  a clear testament to the robust demand for verified carbon credits  even ahead of our first credit issuance. The expansion of our project portfolio resulted in a €23.67 million increase in project value  elevating DGB's total asset value to €29.1 million. We have been building a great pipeline with scheduled annual credit issuances for the next decade. Looking ahead  2024 will be marked by the first issuance of carbon credits from our projects  a significant milestone that highlights the maturity of our development and the transformative impact of our projects. This moment has been four years in the making  and here we are at the breakthrough we've been aiming for; it will be a significant milestone for us.""The full Annual Report is available for download on the DGB's website at www.green.earth/invest/financial-reports.

Møller - Mærsk A/S' (the ""Contributing Company"" or ""APMM"") assets and liabilities will be transferred into a new company  Svitzer Group A/S to be established as part of the Demerger (the ""Receiving Company"")  we have been requested to prepare an independent practitioner's report on the demerger plan dated 22 March 2024 (the ""Demerger Plan"") as independent expert valuers under section 259 of the Danish Companies Act with a view to concluding whether the consideration to the shareholders of APMM for the assets and liabilities that are to be transferred to Svitzer Group A/S is ""fair and reasonable from a financial point of view under the circumstances""  cf. section 259(4) of the Danish Companies Act.For the purpose of this assurance engagement  ""fair and reasonable from a financial point of view under the circumstances"" means that the consideration to the shareholders of A.P. Møller - Mærsk A/S for the assets and liabilities that are to be transferred to the Receiving Company in connection with the Demerger has been determined on a fair and reasonable basis from a financial point of view.We express reasonable assurance in our conclusion.Our conclusion is based on the circumstances on the date of signing this report. For purposes of this engagement  we are not responsible for updating or reissuing any report or conclusion.Our report is prepared solely with a view to complying with the requirements of the Danish Companies Act with respect to an independent practitioner's report on the demerger plan as independent expert valuer's in connection with the Demerger and is to be used exclusively by the shareholders of the Contributing Company and may not be used for any other purposes.The Demerger PlanOn 22 March 2024  the Board of Directors of APMM prepared the Demerger Plan pursuant to section 255 of the Danish Companies Act  which implies that parts of APMM's assets and liabilities  including Svitzer A/S and its subsidiaries  will be transferred to Svitzer Group A/S.Consideration to the shareholders of APMMUnder the Demerger Plan  the shareholders of APMM will upon completion of the Demerger receive the following consideration in form of shares in the Receiving Company (""Consideration Shares""):Each APMM A share of nominally DKK 1 000 (ISIN DK0010244425) will receive two new shares each of nominally DKK 10 in the Receiving Company; Each APMM B share of nominally DKK 1 000 (ISIN DK0010244508) will receive two new shares each of nominally DKK 10 in the Receiving Company; Each APMM A share of nominally DKK 500 (ISIN DK0015996235) will receive one new share of nominally DKK 10 in the Receiving Company; and Each APMM B share of nominally DKK 500 (ISIN DK0015996318) will receive one new share of nominally DKK 10 in the Receiving Company.The shares in the Receiving Company will not be divided into share classes  and all Consideration Shares will thus carry the same shareholder rights in the Receiving Company. As further set out in the Board of Director's statement on the Demerger Plan  the demerger consideration will be allocated based on the APMM shareholders' nominal shareholding in APMM  irrespective of share class.No Consideration Shares will be allocated on treasury shares held by APMM. According to the Demerger Plan  the Consideration Shares will be allocated among the APMM shareholders based on the registered ownership of APMM in Euronext Securities A/S as of closing 1 May 2024.",neutral,0.02,0.97,0.01,neutral,0.03,0.93,0.04,True,English,"['AP Moller Maersk', 'Independent Expert Valuers', 'Independent Practitioner', 'Demerger Plan', 'Report', 'March', 'A.P.

The long unavailability of the GRTgaz gas grid  which prevented FDE from selling the forecasted volumes of abandoned mine methane  has penalised the Group's performance  in a volatile environment. EBITDA reached €10.8m  with an EBITDA margin of 62%  above the Group's objective for 2026  as the Group continues to control its costs  with the cost of goods stable over the half-year (excluding €979k of previous ARENH rights retroceded on December 31st 2022). SG&A (excluding recognition of free awarded shares under IFRS) amounted to €3.4m  following the increase in staff from 29 to 36 (excluding Greenstat) to support FDE's future developments. 1 Results of Cellcius dedicated to the operating of the Creutzwald thermal solar plant (51% owned by FDE and 49% by Énes) and FalkenSun dedicated to the operating of the photovoltaic solar plant of Tritteling (75% owned by FDE and 25% by Mercury Advisors) and Cryo Pur dedicated to LBG and Bio-CO2 (95.08% owned by FDE and the rest by minority shareholders). francaisedelenergie.fr2 Operating profit has reached €9.0m  or 52% of sales. With higher financial expenses related to the €45m green bonds in order to develop FDE's low- carbon energy projects  and current and deferred tax of €1.4m  the Group's net profit has reached €6.3m  compared with €10.4m on December 31st 2022. A solid financial structure to support the Group's developments and share buyback programme In H1 2024  FDE confirmed its ability to generate operating cash flow of €10.5m (before variation in working capital of €2.6m). This operational excellence has again strengthened the cash position of the Group  which has repaid bank loans amounting to €4.9m  including the bridge financing for the 15 MW photovoltaic project and the BPI-SAARLB loan for Gazonor. The Group has cash and cash equivalents of €40.1m (+€13.5m compared with December 31st 2022)  a conservative gearing ratio of 28%  and a net debt/EBITDA ratio of 1.04x  enabling FDE to finance its growth at a competitive cost of capital. FDE investments in its core energy businesses have resulted in significant recurring cash flow generation and have strengthened the Group's balance sheet. In the opinion of FDE's board of Directors and management  FDE's businesses as a whole are worth significantly more than its current market capitalisation. In this context  and under the authorizations currently in place  FDE will re-launch a share buyback programme  thereby increasing the intrinsic value per FDE share for the benefit of existing shareholders  without affecting its financing capacities for the 2026 development plan. Ongoing developments across the entire Group's portfolio On the last semester  FDE has maintained its investment policy  deploying an additional €4.4m  mainly to expand its cogeneration portfolio in France  with some additional installations planned in the coming months. The Group is also continuing to optimize the value of the revenues associated with its current production sites  while maintaining a high level of visibility on its cash flow generation. In addition  Cryo Pur's development in Norway is accelerating  with the contracting of key partnerships for new lands and feedstocks  and the selection of the digesters manufacturer  that will enable the new LBG and Bio-CO2 production unit of 100 GWh/year capacity in Stavanger to contribute to cash flow generation from 2025 onwards. The site for the second LBG and Bio- CO2 production plant  located in Bergen  has also been secured. Lastly  FDE is finalizing the reorganization of its new subsidiary  Greenstat  to accelerate the Group's green hydrogen and solar energy developments and consolidate its position as a key player in Europe's energy transition. This hydrogen portfolio fits in perfectly with FDE's strategy of developing the production of carbon-freehydrogen  and in particular natural hydrogen  in which FDE will continue to invest internationally  but more importantly in France on the 3 Evêchés permit where the tendering period has now ended  leading to the launch of the next development phase by end of 2024. FDE confirms its FY 2026 objectives of annual revenues of more than €100 million  and an EBITDA above €50 million  combined with over 10 million tons of CO2eq emissions avoided per annum 2,neutral,0.02,0.98,0.01,mixed,0.47,0.2,0.33,True,English,"['La Française', 'News release', 'Energie', 'Information', 'accounts', 'results', 'March', '10:15', 'significant recurring cash flow generation', 'FY 2024 Half-year results EBITDA margin', '3 Evêchés permit', 'Creutzwald thermal solar plant', 'carbon negative energy producer', 'low- carbon energy projects', 'Bio- CO2 production plant', 'Net Income Group share', '15 MW solar plant', 'photovoltaic solar plant', 'GRTgaz gas grid', 'previous ARENH rights', 'share buyback programme', '15 MW photovoltaic project', 'conservative gearing ratio', 'net debt/EBITDA ratio', 'higher financial expenses', '€45m green bonds', 'solid financial structure', 'current market capitalisation', 'current production sites', 'operating cash flow', 'solar energy developments', 'Bio-CO2 production unit', 'core energy businesses', 'Ongoing costs control', 'net profit', 'volatile energy', 'cash equivalents', 'energy transition', 'financial strength', 'Financial Result', 'Ongoing developments', 'green hydrogen', 'Operating Income', 'cash position', 'FDE share', 'first half', 'Consolidated accounts', 'Euro Thousands', 'Minority interests1', 'inflationary environment', 'December 31st', 'Wallonia regions', 'long unavailability', 'mine methane', 'volatile environment', 'SG&A', 'future developments', 'Mercury Advisors', 'Cryo Pur', 'minority shareholders', 'deferred tax', 'before variation', 'operational excellence', 'bank loans', 'bridge financing', 'BPI-SAARLB loan', 'balance sheet', 'existing shareholders', 'financing capacities', 'last semester', 'investment policy', 'additional installations', 'coming months', 'high level', 'key partnerships', 'new lands', 'digesters manufacturer', '100 GWh/year capacity', 'new subsidiary', 'key player', 'natural hydrogen', 'tendering period', '2 Operating profit', 'cogeneration portfolio', 'new LBG', 'second LBG', 'hydrogen portfolio', 'growth drivers', 'good performance', 'working capital', 'competitive cost', 'intrinsic value', '2026 development plan', 'The Group', 'entire Group', 'FDE investments', 'H1 2024 sales', '1 Results', '346 EBITDA', 'Pontpierre', 'France', 'Euronext', 'ISIN', 'profitability', 'activities', '2026 objectives', 'Revenues', 'Taxes', 'cogenerations', 'increase', 'volumes', 'Tritteling', 'goods', 'recognition', 'free', 'shares', 'IFRS', 'staff', 'Greenstat', 'Cellcius', 'Énes', 'FalkenSun', 'francaisedelenergie', 'order', 'Gazonor', 'opinion', 'board', 'Directors', 'management', 'context', 'authorizations', 'place', 'benefit', 'visibility', 'Norway', 'contracting', 'feedstocks', 'selection', 'Stavanger', 'onwards', 'Bergen', 'reorganization', 'Europe', 'strategy', 'particular', '14']",2024-03-22,2024-03-23,marketscreener.com

Diego Nardin  FOPE Chief Executive Officer: ""We judge the financial statement results for 2023 very positively. They show growth in the level of sales and good indices for profitability and capital solidity. Sales results are in line with the budget expectations drawn up at the start of 2023. These took into account a complex international economic situation which was confirmed by indicators highlighting slowdowns especially in the second half. The hedging policy for our gold requirements neutralised the fluctuations in gold prices and the primary margin on sales did not change from the budget values. EBITDA Margin was confirmed at 25.4% despite the significant increase over the previous year in expenses incurred for communication and marketing activities. In the same way as the economic aspects  also the management of financial flows was optimised and the net financial position broke even  despite having made all the investments planned for the year. We look positively at the development of the business for 2024 with expected rising sales notwithstanding the ongoing uncertainties related to the international economic context. The specific nature of FOPE's offer and the first positive indications and results from our concessionaires on the appreciation of the new collections and on the potential trend in our collaboration  I believe  support the positive estimates."" Main consolidated results at 31 December 2023 Net Revenues stood at Euro 66.8 million  up by 7.4%  (an increase of Euro 4.6 million) compared to Euro 62.2 million in 2022. Growth was recorded on both international and Italian markets  with the latter standing out for its excellent sales performance  generated by both the boutique in Venice and in general by our concessionaires  and boosted by the high number of foreign tourists in Italy. EBITDA stood at Euro 17.0 million  +7.6% compared to Euro 15.8 million in 2022. Keeping the EBITDA margin steady was important and it stood at 25.4%  despite the increase  compared to 2022  in the expenses incurred for marketing and communication activities.EBIT amounted to Euro 14.7 million  up on Euro 13.9 million in 2022. EBIT margin was 22% compared to 22.4% in 2022 due to the increase in the depreciation of technological and commercial investments. Net Profit stood at Euro 10.1 million  compared to Euro 10.8 million in 2022. Consolidated net profit in 2022 benefitted from particular tax benefits  with a reduction of Euro 1.25 million in the taxes calculated. The Net Financial Position was zero compared to a cash positive position of Euro 1.5 million at 31 December 2022. Equity was Euro 40.0 million  compared to Euro 33.6 million at 31 December 2022. Distribution of the profit for the year The Board of Directors resolved to propose the following allocation of the parent company FOPE S.p.A.'s profit for the year  equal to Euro 9 199 252  to the Shareholders' Meeting Euro 4 609 585 to the extraordinary reserve Euro 4 589 667 to dividends  through the distribution of a gross dividend of Euro 0.85 per share for the 5 399 608 outstanding ordinary shares. In respect of the ordinary dividend that will be paid as from 2 May 2024 - ex-dividend date no. 7 on 29 April 2024 and record date on 30 April 2024 - the dividend yield is 2.89%1  while the payout ratio is 49.89%. Significant events following the end of the year Establishment of FOPE Japan G.K. In January 2024  activities to establish the new company FOPE Japan G.K. were completed. FOPE Japan G.K. is a company incorporated under Japanese law based in Tokyo. It acts as distributor for Fope Group's products on the Japanese market  provides concessionaires with support for sales and customer care  and implements the marketing and communication activities on the market in collaboration with the Group marketing and communication department. FOPE Japan G.K. is 80% held by FOPE S.p.A. and 20% by SwissPrimeBrands Ltd.  a partner of the Group which has handled the distribution of FOPE's products in Japan up to now. The further strengthening of the presence on foreign markets is part of the policy  pursued in recent years by the Group  aimed at establishing a direct commercial presence in areas that are considered strategic  as in the case of Japan  which for FOPE is an emerging market with significant growth potential. Business outlook In light of the positive results recorded in 2023  albeit without disregarding all the caution regarding potential critical future developments in the macroeconomic situation  especially with regard to the geopolitical scenario characterised by the war between Russia and Ukraine  and by the Israel-Palestine conflict  a positive development in the business is expected also for 2024. The Group is not active on the markets affected by the above conflicts and  although it is not possible to rule out indirect negative impacts should there be a general deterioration in the economy due to the crises continuing  no direct phenomena are seen which may influence the positive development of the Group's activities planned for the current year. 1 Dividend yield calculated based on the closing price of FOPE shares on March 21  2024.On the basis of the forecasts made by the Company for 2024  growth in sales and a positive economic result are expected. The results achieved in the first months of 2024 confirm these forecasts and  consequently  the aforementioned expectations.

Audit procedures on the Company’s 2023 consolidated financial statements were completed by the Company’s statutory auditors. Final certification will take place after the completion of procedures required before the Universal Registration Document is filed with the French market authority (Autorité des Marchés Financiers)1.""The Company has implemented significant measures in 2023  the full effect of which is expected in 2024  to reduce its operational expenses and extend its cash runway "" commented Laurence Rodriguez  CEO of GenSight Biologics. ""We are now dedicating all our resources to making LUMEVOQ® doses available  which should enable us to resume our compassionate access programs in France  expected in the third quarter of 2024  as well as to discussions around new financing options with our investors and strategic partners that will fund our activities until this resumption.""Annual Consolidated Financial Statements (IFRS) for the Year Ending December 31  2023 and December 31  2022In million euros As of December 31  2022 2023 Cash and cash equivalent 10.6 2.1 Total assets 25.9 9.1 Total shareholders’ equity (15.3) (30.7) Total liabilities 41.2 39.8In million euros 2022 2023 Operating income 4.9 3.0 Research and development expenses (19.3) (19.4) Sales and marketing expenses (8.0) (7.9) General and administrative expenses (5.4) (5.4) Operating profit (loss) (27.8) (29.7) Financial profit (loss) 0.2 3.5 Net profit (loss) (27.6) (26.2) EPS (in € per share) (0.60) (0.54) Net cash flows from operating activities (33.8) (24.7) Net cash flows from investing activities 0.2 0.2 Net cash flows from financing activities 0.1 15.9 Net cash flows (33.5) (8.6) Cash and cash equivalents at closing 10.6 2.1The variation in the Company's operating income  from €4.9 million as of December 31  2022  to €3.0 million as of December 31  2023  is primarily attributable to the absence of revenue in 2023 from named Patient Temporary Use Authorizations (ATU) for LUMEVOQ® granted by the French National Agency for the Safety of Medicines (ANSM). Following production issues encountered at the Company's partner  the last available doses had been used up by March 2022  generating revenue of €2.6 million in the first quarter of 2022. The Company plans to resume product availability under the Compassionate Use Authorization (AAC  formerly ATU) in France in Q3 2024  upon product availability.The decrease in Research Tax Credit (CIR)  from €2.2 million in 2022 to €1.7 million in 2023  directly stems from the reduction in clinical development expenses for LUMEVOQ®  as the Company is currently engaged in discussions with the EMA  MHRA  and FDA to determine the optimal regulatory pathway for LUMEVOQ®  while designing the protocol for its new phase III clinical trial  RECOVER  to incorporate feedback received from these regulatory agencies.From 2022 to 2023  the Company's research and development expenses remained stable  at €19.3 million in 2022 and €19.4 million in 2023. The decrease of €(0.9) million (or -20%) in personnel expenses excluding share-based payments and the decrease of €(1.5) million in subcontracting and collaboration expenses of the Company were offset by an increase in ""non-cash"" expenses  notably by a €1.1 million increase in share-based payment charges. The Company is currently actively designing the protocol for its phase III study RECOVER and maintaining its efforts in Chemistry  Manufacturing  and Controls (CMC) activities to ensure product supply for this new clinical trial and the resumption of Compassionate Use Authorizations.Sales and marketing expenses reached €7.9 million in 2023 and €8.0 million in 2022  reflecting the intensification of strategic marketing and market access activities in preparation for the commercial launch of LUMEVOQ® in Europe. The Company had begun establishing its local presence in key European countries  including France  Germany  the United Kingdom  Italy  and Spain  by setting up local commercial subsidiaries. From mid-2023 onwards  sales and marketing expenses gradually decreased following the Company's withdrawal of its marketing authorization application with the EMA for LUMEVOQ® and the concomitant decision to terminate activities related to preparing for a commercial launch in Europe.The Company's general and administrative expenses also remained stable and amounted to €5.4 million in 2022 and 2023. The overall decrease in overhead expenses  including a €(0.4) million or -14% decrease in personnel costs excluding share-based payments and a €(1.9) million decrease in consultancy fees  was offset by a €2.0 million increase in share-based payment expenses.The Company's operating loss amounted to €(29.7) million in 2023 compared to €(27.8) million in 2022. This €1.9 million increase is primarily attributed to a €(1.9) million decrease in operating income and a €4.0 million increase in ""non-cash"" expenses related to share-based payments  shifting from a €3.4 million profit in 2022 due to the cancellation of certain free shares plans to a €0.5 million expense in 2023. This increase was partially offset by a general decrease in external and internal expenses as the Company implemented significant cash preservation measures in 2023  including a 40% reduction in its workforce  primarily in commercial teams. This substantial reduction in operating expenses will primarily benefit 2024 and subsequent years.The financial result amounted to €0.2 million and €3.5 million in 2022 and 2023 respectively. The financial result in 2023 is primarily composed of a ""non-cash"" financial gain of €6.8 million related to the fair value change of derivative financial instruments pertaining to the conversion option and warrants attached to the bond financing with Heights and the loan contracted with the European Investment Bank (EIB). This financial gain is offset by interest expenses of €(3.0) million related to the Company's bond financing  bank loans  and state-guaranteed loan  based on the effective interest rate.The Company's net loss amounted to €(27.6) million in 2022 compared to a loss of €(26.2) million in 2023. The weighted average number of shares outstanding increased from 46.3 million in 2022 to 48.3 million in 2023  thereby reducing the loss per share from (€0.54) in 2023 to (€0.60) in 2023. Adjusting for ""non-cash"" charges related to share-based payments and the revaluation of the fair value of financial instruments  the adjusted net loss amounted to €32.4 million in 2023  compared to €32.7 million in 2022.Net cash flows from operating activities amounted to €(24.7) million in 2023  compared to €(33.8) million a year earlier. Excluding changes in working capital  net cash flows from operating activities decreased by €2.7 million despite no revenues being generated during the year  reflecting an overall decrease in operating expenses. This decrease is further accentuated by a significant decrease in working capital needs  amounting to €2.5 million in 2023 compared to €(3.9) million in 2022  mainly due to the progress of development projects and other studies by the end of 2023 compared to the end of 2022.Net cash flows from investment activities remained stable in 2023 compared to 2022 at €0.2 million and primarily relate to the Company's liquidity contract activity.Net cash flows from financing activities amounted to €15.9 million and primarily consist of the first tranche of the credit line from the EIB received in February 2023 for €8 million  the two tranches of the bridge financing signed in August 2023 for a total of €10 million  and the repayment of financial debts amounting to €(1.1) million.Cash and cash equivalents totaled €2.1 million as of December 31  2023  compared to €10.6 million as of December 31  2022.Cash runwayAs of December 31st  2023  the Company available cash and cash equivalents amounted to €2.1 million.Including the gross proceeds of the capital increase completed in February 2024 for €5 million  the Company does not have sufficient net working capital required to meet its obligations over the next 12 months but only until end of April 2024.The net funding requirement for the next 12 months is estimated at €9 million (including the anticipated income from the resumption of the AAC/AAP program in France in Q3 2024)  in view of the Company's need to finance its ongoing activities notably the launch of the new RECOVER Phase III clinical trial and the continuation of its CMC activities.Consequently  the Company needs to seek other sources of financing  including via debt or equity financing or partnership opportunities  in order to extend its cash runway until the receipts from the first revenue of the early access program in France (AAC/AAP). This resumption is expected in Q3 2024 when LUMEVOQ® becomes available and the authorization from the ANSM has been obtained.Detailed information regarding the Company  including its business  financial information  results  perspectives and related risk factors are contained (i) in the Company’s 2022 Universal Registration Document filed with the AMF on May 10  2023 under number D.23-0406 (the ""2022 URD"")  and (ii) the amendment to the 2022 URD filed with the AMF on November 21  2023 under number D.23-0406-A01 (the ""Amendment to the 2022 URD"").

If approved by the European Commission (EC)  bimekizumab will be the first IL-17A and IL-17F inhibitor approved in the EU for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe HS.""The positive opinion from the CHMP represents a significant milestone toward bringing bimekizumab to people living with moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa  a chronic  painful inflammatory skin disease with limited treatment options "" said Emmanuel Caeymaex  Executive Vice President  Immunology Solutions  and Head of U.S.  UCB. ""If approved by the European Commission  this would represent the fourth marketing authorization for bimekizumab in three years  adding to the existing indications in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis  active psoriatic arthritis and active axial spondyloarthritis.""HS is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that manifests as nodules  abscesses and pus-discharging fistulas  i.e.  channels leading out of the skin  typically in the armpits  groin  and buttocks.1 HS affects approximately one percent of the population in most studied countries with those affected experiencing flare-ups of the disease as well as severe pain.1 2 3 People living with HS also experience social stigma  social isolation and low self-esteem  all of which have a major impact on their quality of life.2 3The CHMP positive opinion for bimekizumab is based on findings from the Phase 3 BE HEARD I and BE HEARD II studies which evaluated the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab in the treatment of adults with moderate to severe HS.4 5 Data showed that bimekizumab treatment resulted in statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements over placebo in the signs and symptoms of HS  as measured by HiSCR50 at Week 16  the primary endpoint  with responses sustained to Week 48.4 5 Bimekizumab treatment also resulted in improvements over placebo in the high threshold endpoint  HiSCR75 at Week 16  a key ranked secondary endpoint  with responses sustained to Week 48.4 5 In both studies the safety profile of bimekizumab was consistent with data seen in previous studies with no new observed safety signals.4 5The CHMP positive opinion on bimekizumab in moderate to severe HS will be referred to the EC for its final decision. The marketing authorization would be applicable to all EU member states as well as countries of the EEA.Notes to editors:About BE HEARD I and BE HEARD IIBE HEARD I and BE HEARD II are randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled  parallel group  multicenter  Phase 3 studies designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab in adults with moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (HS).4 5 The two studies had a combined enrolment of 1 014 participants with a diagnosis of moderate to severe HS. The primary endpoint in both studies was HiSCR50 at Week 16.4 5 A key ranked secondary endpoint was HiSCR75 at Week 16.4 5 HiSCR50 and HiSCR75 are defined as at least either a 50 or 75 percent reduction from baseline in the total abscess and inflammatory nodule count  with no increase from baseline in abscess or draining tunnel count.4 5About BIMZELX® (bimekizumab)Bimekizumab is a humanized monoclonal IgG1 antibody that is designed to selectively inhibit both interleukin 17A (IL-17A) and interleukin 17F (IL-17F)  two key cytokines driving inflammatory processes.6 The therapeutic indications in the European Union are:7Plaque psoriasis : Bimekizumab is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy. 7Psoriatic arthritis : Bimekizumab  alone or in combination with methotrexate  is indicated for the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis in adults who have had an inadequate response or who have been intolerant to one or more disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). 7Axial spondyloarthritis: Bimekizumab is indicated for the treatment of adults with active non radiographic axial spondyloarthritis with objective signs of inflammation as indicated by elevated C reactive protein (CRP)  and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) who have responded inadequately or are intolerant to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)  and for the treatment of adults with active ankylosing spondylitis who have responded inadequately or are intolerant to conventional therapy.7BIMZELX® (bimekizumab) EU/EEA* Important Safety Information7The most frequently reported adverse reactions with bimekizumab were upper respiratory tract infections (14.5%  14.6%  16.3% in plaque psoriasis (PSO)  psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA)  respectively) and oral candidiasis (7.3%  2.3%  3.7% in PSO  PsA and axSpA  respectively). Common adverse reactions (≥1/100 to <1/10) were oral candidiasis  tinea infections  ear infections  herpes simplex infections  oropharyngeal candidiasis  gastroenteritis  folliculitis  headache  rash  dermatitis and eczema  acne  injection site reactions and fatigue. Elderly individuals may be more likely to experience certain adverse reactions such as oral candidiasis  dermatitis and eczema when using bimekizumab.Bimekizumab is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the active substance or any of the excipients and in patients with clinically important active infections (e.g. active tuberculosis).Bimekizumab may increase the risk of infections. Treatment with bimekizumab must not be initiated in patients with any clinically important active infection. Patients treated with bimekizumab should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms suggestive of an infection occur. If a patient develops an infection the patient should be carefully monitored. If the infection becomes serious or is not responding to standard therapy  treatment should be discontinued until the infection resolves. Prior to initiating treatment with bimekizumab  patients should be evaluated for tuberculosis (TB) infection. Bimekizumab should not be given in patients with active TB. Patients receiving bimekizumab should be monitored for signs and symptoms of active TB.Cases of new or exacerbations of inflammatory bowel disease have been reported with bimekizumab. Bimekizumab is not recommended in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. If a patient develops signs and symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease or experiences an exacerbation of pre-existing inflammatory bowel disease  bimekizumab should be discontinued and appropriate medical management should be initiated.Serious hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions have been observed with IL-17 inhibitors. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs  administration of bimekizumab should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy initiated.Live vaccines should not be given in patients treated with bimekizumab.Please consult the Summary of Product Characteristics in relation to other side effects  full safety and prescribing information.7European SmPC date of revision: November 2023.Last accessed: March 2024.*EU/EEA means European Union/European Economic Area▼This medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring.

By their nature  such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and assumptions which might cause the actual results  financial condition  performance or achievements of UCB  or industry results  to differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Important factors that could result in such differences include: changes in general economic  business and competitive conditions  the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing  costs associated with research and development  changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB  effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations  safety  quality  data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches  or disruptions of our information technology systems  product liability claims  challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates  competition from other products including biosimilars  changes in laws or regulations  exchange rate fluctuations  changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws  and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline  will progress to product approval or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far  the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models  cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products  which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to differences disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB's efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also  UCB or others could discover safety  side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB's products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover  sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment  including pricing pressure  political and public scrutiny  customer and prescriber patterns or practices  and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes.

It covers all of the Company's bank loans  including the €30 million loan from the European Investment Bank (""EIB"")3 and the two State Guaranteed Loans (""PGE"")  of a principal amount of €5 million each  from BNP Paribas (""BNPP"") and Bpifrance (""BPI"")4.Given this agreement and its cash position  the Company can  according to its current business plan  fund its activities until mid-May 2024  and estimates its financing needs over the next 12 months at approximately €35m.The Company carries on working very actively on other initiatives to strengthen its equity and alleviate its cash constraints in the short term  in order to be able to continue its activities beyond mid-May 2024.Stéphane Piat  CEO of CARMAT  comments: ""This agreement with the EIB  BNP Paribas and Bpifrance on new loan repayment terms is very good news for the Company.Its implementation enables us to extend the maturity of all our financial debts by at least two years  and thus reduce our loan repayments by more than €30 million over the period 2024-2025. During this period  we will therefore be able to allocate our financial resources primarily to support our growth  while also significantly reducing the Company's financing requirements.I would like to thank our banking partners for their commitment to our project. Their support is a mark of confidence in the robustness of our project  and enables us to focus on our primary objective  which is to develop our sales and make Aeson® the reference therapy for advanced biventricular heart failure.""Final Agreement with BNPP and BPI on new repayment terms of the PGEThe banks have granted CARMAT an additional 24-month grace period with subsequent postponement of final loan maturity:- PGE with BNPP: maturity extended from October 27  2026  to October 27  2028;- PGE with BPI: maturity extended from November 30  2026  to November 30  2028.After the grace period  the PGE contracted from BPI will be repaid on a monthly basis  while the PGE contracted from BNPP will give rise to one initial half-yearly payment  followed by monthly payments5.The amounts borrowed will continue to bear interest at fixed rates adjusted versus those of the initial contracts  in order to reflect the evolution of the banks' refinancing rate6. The other terms and conditions of the loans will remain  in substance  unchanged; the credits will particularly remain unsecured and guaranteed at 90% by the French State.Final Agreement with the EIB on new loan repayment terms and on its equitizationThe new repayment terms of the EIB loan  as well as those of the planned equitization  are in all respects similar to those described in the conditional agreement in principle reached with the EIB in January 2024  which had been the subject of a detailed press release by the Company on January 12  2024. Readers are invited to refer to said press release for more details on these terms.Main new repayment terms of the loan- Tranche 1: maturity extended from January 31  2024  to July 31  2026- Tranche 2: maturity extended from May 4  2025  to August 4  2027- Tranche 3: maturity extended from October 29  2026  to October 29  2028The amounts borrowed will continue to bear interest until their new maturity dates at fixed rates specified in the initial contract. Moreover  the initial royalty agreement associated with this loan is modified to begin with respect to 2024 sales and for a duration of 15 years (versus a duration of 13 years in the initial contract).The other terms and conditions of the loan remain  in substance  unchanged (this is notably the case regarding the events of default and early repayment clauses). The loan will remain unsecured.Main terms of the equitization of the loanAn equitization operation of the first tranche of the loan7 will be launched to allow its gradual transformation into CARMAT shares via a trust (fiducie-gestion) created for the requirements of this operation and managed by a trustee independent of the Company and EIB (the ""Trust""). This equitization will successively cover the three tranches of the loan  but the EIB could unilaterally decide  in due time  not to proceed with the equitization of the second and/or third tranches  of which the market would be informed.On the day of the implementation of the equitization8  the Company will proceed with the issuance  free of charge and with the suppression of the preferential subscription right of the shareholders  of a certain number of warrants in favour of the trustee  acting on behalf of the Trust9.Each warrant will allow the subscription of one share of the Company. The Trustee will progressively exercise these warrants. The shares so issued from each exercise will then be gradually sold by the Trust on the market10  and the net proceeds from the sale will be transferred by the Trust to the EIB until the complete repayment of the sums due to the bank for the first tranche of the loan.Should the net proceeds from the sale of the shares not have allowed the total repayment of this tranche to the EIB by July 31  2026 (the new maturity date of the first tranche)  the Company would then repay the balance due to the EIB for this tranche  in cash from its own cash resources  on that date11. A partial cash repayment by the Company of the sums due to the EIB for the first tranche is therefore possible.A mechanism identical to that used for the first tranche would then be put in place for equitizing the second and third tranches of the loan  unless the EIB decided not to do so  of which the market would be informed.Investors are invited to consider the specific risks related to the planned equitization  detailed in the appendix to this press release.About CARMATCARMAT is a French MedTech that designs  manufactures and markets the Aeson® artificial heart. The Company’s ambition is to make Aeson® the first alternative to a heart transplant  and thus provide a therapeutic solution to people suffering from end-stage biventricular heart failure  who are facing a well-known shortfall in available human grafts. The world’s first physiological artificial heart that is highly hemocompatible  pulsatile and self-regulated  Aeson® could save  every year  the lives of thousands of patients waiting for a heart transplant. The device offers patients quality of life and mobility thanks to its ergonomic and portable external power supply system that is continuously connected to the implanted prosthesis. Aeson® is commercially available as a bridge to transplant in the European Union and other countries that recognize CE marking. Aeson® is also currently being assessed within the framework of an Early Feasibility Study (EFS) in the United States. Founded in 2008  CARMAT is based in the Paris region  with its head offices located in Vélizy-Villacoublay and its production site in Bois-d’Arcy. The Company can rely on the talent and expertise of a multidisciplinary team of circa 200 highly specialized people. CARMAT is listed on the Euronext Growth market in Paris (Ticker: ALCAR / ISIN code: FR0010907956).For more information  please go to www.carmatsa.com and follow us on LinkedIn.Name: CARMATISIN code: FR0010907956Ticker: ALCARDisclaimerThis press release and the information contained herein do not constitute an offer to sell or subscribe  nor a solicitation of an order to buy or subscribe to CARMAT shares in any country. This press release may contain forward-looking statements by the company regarding its objectives and prospects. These forward-looking statements are based on the current estimates and anticipations of the company's management and are subject to risk factors and uncertainties such as the company's ability to implement its strategy  the pace of development of CARMAT's production and sales  the pace and results of ongoing or planned clinical trials  technological evolution and competitive environment  regulatory changes  industrial risks  and all risks associated with the company's growth management. The company's objectives mentioned in this press release may not be achieved due to these elements or other risk factors and uncertainties.Significant and specific risks of the company are those described in its universal registration document filed with the French Financial Markets Authority (Autorité des marchés financiers - the “AMF”) under number D.23-0323 and in its amendment filed with the AMF on January 17  2024 under number D.23-0323-A1. Readers' attention is particularly drawn to the fact that the company's current cash runway is limited to mid-May 2024. Readers and investors are also advised that other risks  unknown or not considered significant and specific  may or could exist.Aeson® is an active implantable medical device commercially available in the European Union and other countries recognizing CE marking. The Aeson® total artificial heart is intended to replace the ventricles of the native heart and is indicated as a bridge to transplant for patients suffering from end-stage biventricular heart failure (INTERMACS classes 1-4) who cannot benefit from maximal medical therapy or a left ventricular assist device (LVAD) and who are likely to undergo a heart transplant within 180 days of implantation. The decision to implant and the surgical procedure must be carried out by healthcare professionals trained by the manufacturer. The documentation (clinician manual  patient manual  and alarm booklet) should be carefully read to understand the features of Aeson® and the information necessary for patient selection and proper use (contraindications  precautions  side effects). In the United States  Aeson® is currently exclusively available as part of an Early Feasibility Study approved by the Food & Drug Administration (FDA).AppendixRisk factors associated with the planned EquitizationThe public’s attention is drawn to the risk factors associated with the Company and its activity  as described (i) in Chapter 2 of its 2022 Universal Registration Document filed with the AMF (French Financial Market Authority) on April 21  2023  and (ii) in its amendment filed with the AMF on January 17  2024 under number D.23-0323-A1. Both documents are available free of charge on the Company’s website (www.carmatsa.com) and the AMF website (www.amf-france.org).Readers’ attention is especially drawn to the fact that the Company’s current cash runway only extends to mid-May 2024. The occurrence of all or some of these risks could have a negative impact on the Company’s activity  financial situation  results  development or outlook.Moreover  investors are invited to take into consideration the following specific risk factors associated with the envisaged Equitization:- risk of dilution for the Company’s shareholders: shareholders will suffer dilution when the Warrants are exercised;- risk regarding the share price: as the trustee acting on behalf of the Trust will not be intending to remain a shareholder in the Company  the divestments of shares issued upon exercise of the Warrants could result in significant downward pressure on CARMAT’s share price  and shareholders could thus experience a loss of their invested capital due to a significant reduction in the value of the Company’s shares;- risk regarding the volatility and liquidity of the Company’s shares: the divestment on the market  of shares issued upon exercise of the Warrants could have significant consequences on the volatility and liquidity of its shares; and- risk  should the EIB not be fully repaid via the Equitization operation: the Company could have to repay part of the various tranches of the loan in cash if  by the new due dates of each of these tranches  the net proceeds of the share divestments had not enabled the EIB to be fully repaid with respect to each of these tranches.Dilution Related to the Planned EquitizationFor illustrative purposes only  assuming (i) the warrants are exercised at a price equal to the lowest weighted average daily trading price of the Company's share observed over the fifteen trading days preceding January 31  2024 (i.e.  €4.06) and (ii) the underlying shares are sold at the closing price of the Company's share on the eve of that same date  4.4 million warrants would need to be exercised to fully repay the sums due to the EIB for the first tranche (i.e.  €18 million). Under this scenario  a shareholder holding 1% of the Company's capital before the equitization of the first tranche would see their stake reduced to 0.87% of the capital after the equitization of this tranche.Based on the same assumptions  11.6 million warrants would have to be exercised to fully repay the sums due to the EIB for the three tranches of the loan (i.e.  €47 million); under this scenario  a shareholder holding 1% of the Company's capital before the equitization of the three tranches would see their stake reduced to 0.71% of the capital after the equitization of said tranches.This example of dilution does not prejudge the final number of shares to be issued  nor their issuing price or sale price  which will be determined based on the prevailing market price at the time of the warrants' exercise and the sale of the underlying shares.1 Press release dated January 12  2024  on the conditional agreement in principle with the EIB.2 Press release dated February 22  2024  providing an update on the renegotiation of loan repayment terms with financial creditors.3 Under the terms of an agreement entered into on December 17  2018  the Company has contracted a loan from the EIB for an amount of 30 million euros paid in 3 tranches of 10 million euros each  on January 31  2019 (the ""First Tranche"")  May 4  2020 (the ""Second Tranche"") and October 29  2021 (the ""Third Tranche"" and  together with the other tranches  the ""Tranches"")  with each tranche initially to be repaid  in principal and interest  5 years after its payment to the Company.4 Two PGEs contracted in the fourth quarter of 2020  with BNP Paribas and Bpifrance respectively  for a principal amount of €5 million each  repayable from the fourth quarter of 2022 to the fourth quarter of 2026.5 Repayments will resume in May 2025 for the PGE with BNPP and in December 2024 for the PGE with Bpifrance.6 As of the date of this press release  the new interest rate applicable to the PGEs is estimated to be in the range of 4 to 4.5%.7 The equitization will cover both the principal and the interest of the loan  so that the Company will not have to disburse anything for that tranche once equitization is initiated  up to its new term (except in cases of default or early repayment  which remain unchanged).8 Given the time required to set up the equitization  the Company anticipates that it should begin during the second quarter of 2024.9 Regarding the first tranche of the EIB loan  this issuance would be based on the delegation granted by the Assembly on January 5  2024  under its eleventh resolution. It is specified that additional warrants may later be issued by the Company to the trustee  acting on behalf of the Trust  if the number warrants initially issued is insufficient to fully complete the Equitization.10 The conditions for exercising the warrants and selling the shares  particularly in terms of price and volumes  will be defined in the trust agreement.11 In view of this  the Company will grant an autonomous first-demand guarantee to the EIB  in case of non-repayment on the date agreed in the EIB Loan Agreement  of the sums due for the First Tranche. Conversely  it should be noted that the exercise of the warrants and the sale of the underlying shares will be halted should all the sums due for the First Tranche have been repaid to the EIB.View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240322677078/en/",neutral,0.16,0.83,0.01,mixed,0.57,0.26,0.17,True,English,"['New Repayment Terms', 'Final Agreement', 'Financial Creditors', 'Bank Loans', 'CARMAT', 'advanced total artificial heart', 'advanced biventricular heart failure', 'one initial half-yearly payment', 'additional 24-month grace period', 'Main new repayment terms', 'two State Guaranteed Loans', 'new loan repayment terms', 'early repayment clauses', 'current business plan', 'Stéphane Piat', 'preferential subscription right', 'European Investment Bank', 'new maturity dates', ""banks' refinancing rate"", 'detailed press release', 'initial royalty agreement', 'Main terms', 'final loan maturity', 'French State', 'other terms', 'initial contracts', 'bank loans', 'two years', '€30 million loan', 'loan repayments', 'Regulatory News', 'therapeutic alternative', 'financial creditors', 'conditional agreements', 'principal amount', 'BNP Paribas', 'financing needs', 'next 12 months', 'other initiatives', 'short term', 'good news', 'financial debts', 'financial resources', 'banking partners', 'primary objective', 'reference therapy', 'subsequent postponement', 'monthly basis', 'monthly payments', 'fixed rates', 'gradual transformation', 'three tranches', 'due time', 'third tranches', 'final agreement', 'Final maturity', 'cash position', 'cash constraints', 'financing requirements', 'first tranche', 'EIB loan', 'CARMAT shares', 'The Company', 'equitization operation', '2 years', '15 years', '13 years', 'ALCAR', 'designer', 'developer', 'world', 'people', 'principle', 'January', 'February', 'PGE', 'BNPP', 'Bpifrance', 'activities', 'mid-May', 'equity', 'order', 'CEO', 'implementation', 'growth', 'commitment', 'project', 'support', 'mark', 'confidence', 'robustness', 'sales', 'Aeson®', 'October', 'November', 'rise', 'amounts', 'interest', 'evolution', 'conditions', 'substance', 'credits', 'respects', 'subject', 'Readers', 'details', 'July', 'August', 'duration', 'case', 'events', 'default', 'loan7', 'trust', 'fiducie-gestion', 'second', 'day', 'issuance', 'charge', 'suppression', 'shareho']",2024-03-22,2024-03-23,marketscreener.com

FINAL AGREEMENT WITH BNPP AND BPI ON NEW REPAYMENT TERMS OF THE PGE The banks have granted CARMAT an additional 24-month grace period with subsequent postponement of final loan maturity: PGE with BNPP: maturity extended from October 27  2026  to October 27  2028;PGE with BPI: maturity extended from November 30  2026  to November 30  2028. After the grace period  the PGE contracted from BPI will be repaid on a monthly basis  while the PGE contracted from BNPP will give rise to one initial half-yearly payment  followed by monthly payments5. The amounts borrowed will continue to bear interest at fixed rates adjusted versus those of the initial contracts  in order to reflect the evolution of the banks' refinancing rate6. The other terms and conditions of the loans will remain  in substance  unchanged; the credits will particularly remain unsecured and guaranteed at 90% by the French State. FINAL AGREEMENT WITH THE EIB ON NEW LOAN REPAYMENT TERMS AND ON ITS EQUITIZATION The new repayment terms of the EIB loan  as well as those of the planned equitization  are in all respects similar to those described in the conditional agreement in principle reached with the EIB in January 2024  which had been the subject of a detailed press release by the Company on January 12  2024.Readers are invited to refer to said press release for more details on these terms. Main new repayment terms of the loan Tranche 1: maturity extended from January 31  2024  to July 31  2026Tranche 2: maturity extended from May 4  2025  to August 4  2027Tranche 3: maturity extended from October 29  2026  to October 29  2028 The amounts borrowed will continue to bear interest until their new maturity dates at fixed rates specified in the initial contract. Moreover  the initial royalty agreement associated with this loan is modified to begin with respect to 2024 sales and for a duration of 15 years (versus a duration of 13 years in the initial contract). The other terms and conditions of the loan remain  in substance  unchanged (this is notably the case regarding the events of default and early repayment clauses). The loan will remain unsecured. Main terms of the equitization of the loan An equitization operation of the first tranche of the loan7 will be launched to allow its gradual transformation into CARMAT shares via a trust (fiducie-gestion) created for the requirements of this operation and managed by a trustee independent of the Company and EIB (the ""Trust""). This equitization will successively cover the three tranches of the loan  but the EIB could unilaterally decide  in due time  not to proceed with the equitization of the second and/or third tranches  of which the market would be informed. Repayments will resume in May 2025 for the PGE with BNPP and in December 2024 for the PGE with Bpifrance. As of the date of this press release  the new interest rate applicable to the PGEs is estimated to be in the range of 4 to 4.5%. The equitization will cover both the principal and the interest of the loan  so that the Company will not have to disburse anything for that tranche once equitization is initiated  up to its new term (except in cases of default or early repayment  which remain unchanged). 2 / 5On the day of the implementation of the equitization8  the Company will proceed with the issuance  free of charge and with the suppression of the preferential subscription right of the shareholders  of a certain number of warrants in favour of the trustee  acting on behalf of the Trust9. Each warrant will allow the subscription of one share of the Company. The Trustee will progressively exercise these warrants. The shares so issued from each exercise will then be gradually sold by the Trust on the market10  and the net proceeds from the sale will be transferred by the Trust to the EIB until the complete repayment of the sums due to the bank for the first tranche of the loan. Should the net proceeds from the sale of the shares not have allowed the total repayment of this tranche to the EIB by July 31  2026 (the new maturity date of the first tranche)  the Company would then repay the balance due to the EIB for this tranche  in cash from its own cash resources  on that date11. A partial cash repayment by the Company of the sums due to the EIB for the first tranche is therefore possible. A mechanism identical to that used for the first tranche would then be put in place for equitizing the second and third tranches of the loan  unless the EIB decided not to do so  of which the market would be informed.

For more information on UCB’s LTI plans  please refer to the 2023 remuneration report.

These free shares will be delivered after a three-year vesting period and the number of shares actually allocated will vary from 0% to 150% of the number of shares initially granted depending on the level of achievement of the performance conditions set by the Board of Directors of UCB SA/NV at the moment of grant.The estimated figures under a) and b) do not take into account employees hired or promoted to eligible levels between 1 January 2024 and 1 April 2024.12.

These clauses are standard requests from our creditors and/or in the legal documentation of our financing arrangements.12.1 EMTN Program – renewalUCB SA/NV has entered into a Euro Medium Term Note Program dated 6 March 2013 for an amount of EUR 5 000 000 000  with last update of the Base Prospectus on 17 October 2023  as this program may be further amended  extended or updated from time to time (the “EMTN Program”).
