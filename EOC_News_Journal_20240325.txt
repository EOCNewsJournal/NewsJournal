38058,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://nypost.com/2024/03/24/us-news/with-ukraine-aid-stuck-in-congress-lawmakers-weigh-alternatives-to-help-kyiv/,With Ukraine aid stuck in Congress  lawmakers weigh alternatives to help Kyiv,Republican lawmakers have floated a handful of different mechanisms to replenish Ukraine's military supplies  that are seemingly aimed at placating hardliners from their right flank who are opposed to any new aid to the war-torn ally altogether.,Now that the House and Senate have hammered out a spending deal for the rest of fiscal year 2024  the deadlock over Ukraine aid will come into renewed focus once lawmakers return from their Easter break early next month.With a Senate-passed supplemental spending bill that includes $60 billion in Ukraine military assistance languishing unconsidered  House Republican lawmakers — the majority of whom are believed to back continued support for Kyiv — have pitched other mechanisms to keep the aid flowing.Some have suggested only dispatching military aid while abstaining from humanitarian support  others have pushed for a loan  and some have suggested the possibility of tapping into frozen Russian assets to help foot the bill.Military only aidMany critics of renewed support for Ukraine have made hay about how past tranches of aid helped fund pensions  schools  hospitals  and other non-military needs in Kyiv.“The president said that it’s really important that we keep funding pensions in Ukraine. I would observe that the US Census Bureau says that in 2022  the US pension shortfall is $1.4 trillion ” Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) complained during a hearing last year.The supplemental package that cleared the Senate last month included $1.6 billion to help Kyiv’s private sector  and about $8 billion to help its government continue to function.9 Support for Ukraine has transcended party lines  albeit with considerable infighting amongst Republicans. Getty ImagesSome have suggested that the US scrap the soft support and focus strictly on lethal military hardware.Under that scenario  however  “the Ukrainian government will rapidly not be able to function ” Brian Stokes  a visiting senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund who has studied Ukraine  tells The Post.“It seems like a very facile and easy way for Republicans to feel like they aren’t giving away taxpayer money when in fact  they could be consigning the Ukrainian government to failure — and not failure on the battlefield but failure internally ” added Stokes  who explained that economic pressure and damage to critical infrastructure caused by the fighting have left Kyiv officials dependent on multi-layered assistance.Loaning Ukraine aidAnother option is to simply loan Kyiv what it needs.Last month  former President Donald Trump voiced support for packaging aid to Ukraine in the form of a loan that it would eventually be expected to repay.9 Donald Trump suggested the US write a loan to Ukraine  rather than supplying the ally with weaponry outright. Getty ImagesThat idea appears to have gained some steam among Republican lawmakers. Last week  for instance  Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and argued in favor of the loan option.“When someone is in the process of drowning  they’ll take any lifeline ” says John Herbst  a former US ambassador to Ukraine in the George W. Bush administration.Ukraine may be inclined to accept such an offer  but there are questions about whether they will be able to repay it.“There’s no path for them — in multi-decades  probably — where they would ever have any possibility of paying it back. So I think that’s just a marketing gimmick ” says retired Lt. Col. Daniel Davis  a senior fellow at the Defense Priorities foreign policy think tank who opposes efforts to marshal more assistance to Ukraine.Other experts are concerned about the long-term toll a loan could exact on Ukraine  especially during its future reconstruction efforts.9 Sen. Lindsey Graham has backed efforts to send Ukraine weaponry via a loan. REUTERS“If you put money in as a loan  even on terms that are forgivable  any other investor becomes potentially subordinated to that loan ” explained Douglas Rediker  a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.“Private investors [would be] even less likely to support Ukraine going forward because they know in a crunch  the US government would get repaid first ” Stokes said. “Frankly  what we need is for private investors to be willing to buy Ukrainian bonds.”Cashing in frozen Russian assetsShortly after Moscow’s tanks rolled into Ukraine  Western nations moved to freeze an estimated $280 billion worth of Russian sovereign central bank assets. This includes roughly 210 billion euros ($228 billion)  the EU estimates it has in stasis at Belgian financial services company Euroclear.Meanwhile  the amount of US-controlled Russian assets are thought to be much smaller. Estimates vary  but the US has at least $5 billion in central bank assets  per the Russian Elites  Proxies  and Oligarchs Task Force. Some estimates claim the amount of frozen assets broadly immobilized by the US is between $40 billion and $60 billion.A number of lawmakers  including House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.)  have floated the idea of tapping into Russia’s frozen assets to help foot the bill for Ukraine’s efforts to fend off Moscow.9 Speaker Mike Johnson has repeatedly affirmed his support for Kyiv but has yet to take up a vote on aid. Aaron Schwartz/NurPhoto/ShutterstockThis past week  European leaders agreed in principle to take the interest off those assets and funnel it to Ukraine  much to the outrage of the Kremlin. This would amount to roughly 3 billion euros ($3.2 billion) and Europe would begin wiring that to Ukraine as early as July  according to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.“Given the fact that we’re not at war with them  to take another country’s money because we don’t like what they’re doing sets a huge precedent ” Davis warned when asked about the US following a similar route.Numerous iterations of the Rebuilding Economic Prosperity and Opportunity for Ukrainians Act (REPO Act) have circulated in Congress and would authorize the president to confiscate Russian reserves in the US.However  there are concerns that such a move could threaten the US dollar’s perch as the most dominant world reserve currency.“Central bank reserves are generally supposed to be out of reach of any claims against them. They are sacrosanct under central banking practices ” Rediker said. “The exception to that is if you are at war with another country…we are not technically at war with Russia.”“The argument against doing so is you have now created a window for other countries that might also be guilty of bad acts  to say  ‘Wow  we should take our money out of the US Federal Reserve System  because it is now potentially subject to seizure.'”9 Smoke rises from an electricity facility after a Russian attack in Kharkiv  Ukraine. APHerbst  the former ambassador who is now the senior director of the Atlantic Council’s Eurasia Center  scoffed at the suggestion that seizing the assets and transmitting them to Ukraine would be an unnecessary slap at Russia.“Oh  that’d be really provocative ” he said sarcastically. “Nothing like launching a war  murdering tens of thousands of people  and kidnapping 20 000 kids.“If you look at what Russia has done in occupied Ukraine  it’s war crime after war.”Stokes acknowledged that the US and Europe will eventually use the Russian assets to some purpose  telling The Post “that horse has left the barn.”Philip Zelikow  a senior fellow at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution  argued the assets would be better used to fund Ukraine’s reconstruction efforts rather than the war itself.“It is appropriate to look to the Russian assets to help address Ukraine’s financial needs  especially for reconstruction and recovery ” he said. “Military assistance  however  is best provided with taxpayer support  as an investment in our own defense – and with much more efficiency and less cost than the alternatives.”The traditional approachPast batches of Ukraine aid entailed military and humanitarian support without strings attached. Since August of last year  President Biden has pleaded with Congress to do the same this time around.Johnson has argued that before any such action is taken  the White House must explain in detail Ukraine’s military objectives — whether it is the prevention of losing any more territory to Russia  the ejection of Russian forces from the eastern Donbas region  or the return of Crimea following its annexation by Moscow in 2014.9 President Biden has repeatedly advocated that Congress green-light a fresh tranche of aid to Ukraine. APAImages/Shutterstock“This war is not winnable militarily for Ukraine under any circumstances. Russia’s power is only going to continue to grow over time ” Davis argued. “For the US Congress  the issue is  why do you want to give it $60 billion for something that can’t be militarily accomplished?”Other commentators disagreed with that assessment.9 Many experts contend that Russian President Vladimir Putin can’t be trusted to abide by any potential settlement. AP“If the United States continues to support Ukraine the way it has  Russia will not be victorious ” Herbst insisted. “If we stop providing roughly comparable assistance  or if we were to cut off assistance entirely  the chances of a Russian victory are much higher. It would be a disaster for American interests.”Herbst steered clear of using the phrase “Ukrainian victory” but instead underscored that the objective is to deny Russia the ability to “take political control of Ukraine.”“This is not just for Ukraine  this is the war for [the] liberal international order. Just look at how unstable the world has become last year [as] this perception of the Western failure spread ” added Maria Snegovaya  a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.9 JD Vance is one of the most outspoken critics of marshaling another aid package to Ukraine. AFP via Getty ImagesOne of the most prominent opponents of additional aid  Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio) has argued that the US simply lacks the manufacturing capacity necessary to help Ukraine prevail.While Herbst disagrees with Vance’s opposition to replenishing aid  he concurs that the US military-industrial capacity is not up to snuff.“What we’ve learned in Moscow’s big invasion of Ukraine is that we don’t have enough weapons to deal with … a Russian attack on NATO or a Chinese attack on Taiwan  even if we didn’t send one bullet to Ukraine ” he said.“We’re learning a ton of stuff about weapons efficiency for a future war.”Herbst believes that the Biden administration needs to be less reluctant to send Ukraine offensive weaponry  such as F-16 fighter jets  Abrams tanks  tactical missiles with a range of 300 km (186 miles) and electronic warfare components.Proponents of aid have also highlighted the fact that most of the money is being used to revitalize US military-industrial capacity.“Those [weapons sent] were often several if not multiple years old ” Stokes said. “We’re replacing them with more up-to-date armaments…it’s actually spurring us to up our game a bit.”When will Congress tackle Ukraine aidAt the moment  congressional leadership hasn’t outlined a clear path forward on passing Ukraine aid.“It was important for us to not put the supplemental in front of the appropriations bills because it would affect  probably  the vote tally ultimately on the appropriations and we had to get our government funded ” Johnson told The Post last week during the House GOP retreat in West Virginia.9 Marjorie Taylor Greene is dangling a motion to vacate the speaker if he takes up Ukraine aid for a vote on the floor. Getty ImagesJohnson demurred on a specific timeline.The appropriations bill barely cleared the House last Friday and afterward  Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) flashed a motion to vacate as a “warning” — something she also previously threatened to do if Johnson moves a Ukraine supplemental.Congress is now in recess  with the House returning April 9.Meanwhile  half a world away  Ukraine has been battered by munition shortages as it seeks to fend off Russian invaders and there are growing concerns about a new offensive in the summer.But getting the military hardware to Ukraine will take time.“It’s not as if the day after the president signs it  the stuff gets loaded onto airplanes ” Stokes emphasized. “We’re likely to be  I would say  at the very least about six months late in terms of moving this aid  and time matters in war.”,neutral,0.24,0.44,0.32,negative,0.05,0.3,0.65,True,English,"['Ukraine aid', 'Congress', 'lawmakers', 'alternatives', 'Kyiv', 'Defense Priorities foreign policy think tank', 'Russian sovereign central bank assets', 'George W.

MATTERS ON THE AGENDA OF THE EXTRAORDINARY GENERAL MEETING:Opening of the meeting Calling the meeting to order Approval of the Agenda Election of persons to scrutinize the minutes and to supervise the counting of votes Recording the legality and quorum of the meeting Recording the attendance at the meeting and adoption of the list of votes Presentation of the report of the special auditADVERTISEMENTThe special audit report  dated 18 March 2024  has been prepared by Jussi Savio (Authorised Public Accountant). The conclusion on the conduced audit states as follows:As a whole  we have not identified any concrete issues on account of which a special audit was ordered due to suspicions.The revenue generated by ore sales is low  especially relative to the Group's revenue as a whole.Ore has not been sold to Hino Resources Co. Ltd.Ore has not been sold to parties which are with certainty known or suspected to belong to Danko Koncar's immediate circle. However  the audit does not allow to establish with certainty which companies are definitely closely associated with Danko Koncar.The audit did not reveal any sales where ore would have been sold at a price lower than the world market price. In our view  it is not possible to conduct this review and draw conclusions completely unequivocally  due  inter alia  to the possible freight costs affecting the pricing of the ore and their impact on the selling price.The audit did not reveal payments for unfounded complaints by ATL to the suspected companies closely associated with Danko Koncar or to any other companies.During the 2017 financial period  ATL paid a total of approximately EUR 11 million through various offsetting procedures to the closely associated companies. The Company has provided us with explanations regarding the basis and background of these payments  as described in the audit report from page 32 onwards. Despite these clarifications  we felt that we did not have full clarity as to why such offsetting procedures had been implemented. However  we did not find any wrongdoings in these payments.Story continues8. Closing of the MeetingB.
