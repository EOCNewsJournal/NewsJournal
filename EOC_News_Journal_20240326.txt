Election of persons to scrutinize the minutes and to supervise the counting of votes5. Recording the legality and quorum of the meeting6. Recording the attendance at the meeting and adoption of the list of votes7. Presentation of the report of the special audit The special audit report  dated 18 March 2024  has been prepared by Jussi Savio (Authorised Public Accountant). The conclusion on the conduced audit states as follows:- As a whole  we have not identified any concrete issues on account of which a special audit was ordered due to suspicions.- The revenue generated by ore sales is low  especially relative to the Group's revenue as a whole.- Ore has not been sold to Hino Resources Co. Ltd.- Ore has not been sold to parties which are with certainty known or suspected to belong to Danko Koncar's immediate circle. However  the audit does not allow to establish with certainty which companies are definitely closely associated with Danko Koncar.- The audit did not reveal any sales where ore would have been sold at a price lower than the world market price. In our view  it is not possible to conduct this review and draw conclusions completely unequivocally  due  inter alia  to the possible freight costs affecting the pricing of the ore and their impact on the selling price.- The audit did not reveal payments for unfounded complaints by ATL to the suspected companies closely associated with Danko Koncar or to any other companies.- During the 2017 financial period  ATL paid a total of approximately EUR 11 million through various offsetting procedures to the closely associated companies. The Company has provided us with explanations regarding the basis and background of these payments  as described in the audit report from page 32 onwards. Despite these clarifications  we felt that we did not have full clarity as to why such offsetting procedures had been implemented. However  we did not find any wrongdoings in these payments.8.

Adoption of indemnification schemeA statement on indemnification of Board and management members in Danish limited liability companies has been issued by the Danish Business Authority on 13 April 2023. Based on the company's review  the Board of Directors proposes that the annual general meeting adopts a scheme for indemnification of the members of the Board and Directors on the following terms and conditions (the ""Scheme""):Basis and purpose - Whereas it is the company's policy to take out appropriate and customary directors' and officers' liability insurance for members of the Board and Directors  experience shows that it is necessary to offer additional coverage for potential D&O liability in order to attract and retain qualified members of the Board and Directors  particularly individuals accustomed to common law liability regimes  in consideration of the business and the risks associated with the position as member of the Board of Directors of Better Collective. Furthermore  the Company's operations comprise certain activities  which may imply special responsibilities and increased risk exposure for the members of the Board and Directors  particularly in certain foreign jurisdictions. Accordingly  it is considered in the best interest of Better Collective and its shareholders that members of the Board and Directors are offered indemnification against claims raised by third parties supplemental to the Company's D&O liability insurance as further outlined below.It has been duly considered if the Scheme would imply adverse effects for the Company and its shareholders  including if the Scheme would result in excessive and/or hazardous risk-taking behaviour by the members of the Board and Directors and/or if the Scheme would be redundant if Better Collective increased the coverage under the D&O liability insurance. Better Collective has assessed that such alternative increase of the D&O liability insurance coverage would not be commercially viable  and thus not in the interest of the Company and its shareholders. Furthermore  the Scheme is deemed not to encourage members of the Board and Directors to act differently than if the D&O liability insurance coverage would be increased.Covered individuals - The Scheme shall be for the sole benefit of the current and future members of the Board of Directors of the Company. No third party shall be entitled to rely on or derive any benefits from the Scheme or have any recourse against the company on account of the Scheme.Scope - Under the Scheme  the Company shall indemnify and hold harmless a member of the Board and Directors  to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law  from and against any losses incurred by such member of the Board and Directors arising out of any actual or potential claims  including any costs  expenses and potential tax liabilities associated therewith  raised by any third party (other than Better Collective group companies) against a member of the Board and Directors based on such member of the Board and Directors discharge of his/her duties as member of the Board and Directors.Indemnification of members of the Board and Directors under the Scheme is not conditioned on coverage under the D&O liability insurance and shall be secondary to coverage under the D&O liability insurance  as applicable from time to time  and other indemnification sources  if any  i.e.  Better Collective shall not provide indemnification under the Scheme before coverage under the D&O liability insurance and indemnification available from any other source are exhausted. Accordingly  the Scheme may provide coverage for losses which are not covered wholly or partly under the D&O liability insurance  as applicable from time to time. Such secondary coverage does not imply an obligation on Better Collective to exhaust any and all opportunities to relief members of the Board and Directors from liability and does not prevent Better Collective from covering members of the Board and Directors legal defence costs related to potential liability based on a member of the Board and Directors discharge of his/her duties as member of the Board and Directors.Covered conduct - Under the Scheme  indemnification shall apply to any losses incurred by a member of the Board and Directors arising out of and/or based on such member of the Board and Directors discharge of his/her duties as member of the Board of Directors of Better Collective. Any and all losses relating to liability incurred by a member of the Board and Directors arising out of such member of the Board and Directors fraud  sanctioned offences under applicable criminal law or deliberate criminal acts  improper acts and omissions (in Danish ""utilbørlige dispositioner"")  wilful misconduct or  to the extent not indemnifiable under Danish law  gross negligence are excluded from indemnification under the Scheme.Term and covered claims - The Scheme shall apply until amended or revoked by the general meeting of Better Collective. Subject to the Scheme's terms and conditions  this Scheme covers claims made against a member of the Board and Directors arising out of or originates from facts or circumstances prior to the expiry of the term of the Scheme. Claims for indemnification must be notified in writing by a member of the Board and Directors to Better Collective as soon as reasonably possible after the member of the Board and Directors receipt of the claim and no later than 10 years after the expiry of the Scheme's term.Implementation  administration and authority - For the purpose of implementing the Scheme  the Board of Directors shall stipulate the procedural and administrative provisions and other necessary regulations governing the Scheme. In order to eliminate potential conflicts of interests  the Scheme shall be administered by one or more individuals considered independent from the Board of Directors in respect of the Scheme. Furthermore  indemnification of a member of the Board and Directors loss under the Scheme shall always be subject to a legal opinion from a reputable law firm setting out that the claim concerned is covered by the Scheme. Better Collective's obligation to indemnify members of the Board and Directors under the Scheme shall be capped at a market consistent level in due consideration of the activities and risk profile of Better Collective. All claims for indemnification  including if the conduct of a member of the Board and Directors is covered by the Scheme  shall be processed and decided in accordance with Danish law. For the purpose of establishing an indemnification scheme for the Executive Board  the Board of Directors stipulates the terms and conditions applicable to such indemnification scheme within the framework of the Scheme applicable to the Board of Directors.Amendment of the articles of association as a consequence of the indemnification schemeTo provide transparency in respect of the proposed indemnification scheme  the Board of Directors proposes to the general meeting that the following wording is included as a new article 15 in the Company's articles of association:""The Company has established an indemnification scheme for members of the board of directors. Under the indemnification scheme  the Company shall indemnify members of the board of directors from and against any losses incurred by members of the board of directors arising out of any claims raised by any third party (other than Better Collective group companies) based on such members of the board of directors' discharge of their duties as members of the board of directors. Any losses relating to liability incurred by a member of the board of directors arising out of such member's fraud  sanctioned offences under applicable criminal law or deliberate criminal acts  improper acts and omissions (in Danish ""utilbørlige dispositioner"")  wilful misconduct or  to the extent not indemnifiable under Danish law  gross negligence are excluded from indemnification under the Scheme. Indemnification under the scheme shall be secondary to coverage from other sources of indemnification or coverage of liability and is not conditioned on coverage under the directors' and officers' liability insurance  as applicable from time to time.

The Notice of Annual General Meeting is set out on pages 6 to 9 of this document. A Form of Proxy for use at the Annual General Meeting is enclosed.Chairman's Letter to ShareholdersDear Shareholder The Annual General Meeting (the ""AGM"") of SIG plc (the ""Company"") will be held at 9.30am on Thursday 2 May 2024 at SIG West London  Mathisen Way  Poyle  Slough SL3 0HB.We consider the AGM to be an important event in our calendar and an opportunity for the Board of Directors to engage with our shareholders. This year the AGM will be held as a physical meeting. Each Chair of the Board's Audit & Risk  Remuneration and Nominations Committees will be available at the AGM to answer any questions arising from the work of those Committees.If you would like to ask a question relating to the business of the AGM in advance  please email us atcosec@sigplc.com.All questions submitted in advance will be answered at the meeting where possible. We encourage you to monitor our website atwww.sigplc.com where we will communicate any additional information relating to the AGM arrangements  should the need arise.The formal Notice of AGM of the Company is set out on pages 6 to 9 and an explanation of the business to be considered and voted on at the AGM is set out in this letter.Annual Report And Accounts (Resolution 1)The Chairman will present the audited Annual Report and Accounts of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2023 to the meeting. Shareholders are asked to receive the reports of the Directors and the Auditor  the Strategic Report and the Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2023.Directors' Remuneration Report (Resolution 2)The Directors' Remuneration Report is set out in the 2023 Annual Report and Accounts on pages 96 to 121. Resolution 2 is the ordinary resolution to approve the Directors' Remuneration Report. The vote upon the Directors' Remuneration Report is advisory and does not affect the future remuneration paid to any Director.The report gives details of the Directors' remuneration for the year ended 31 December 2023. The report also includes a statement from the Chair of the Remuneration Committee and details of the Remuneration Committee's representations and activities. The Company's Auditor  Ernst & Young LLP  have audited those parts of the Directors' Remuneration Report which are required to be audited and their report is issued in the Annual Report and Accounts.Re-Election Of Directors (Resolutions 3 to 12)All current Directors are seeking re-election at the AGM in accordance with the requirements of the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code.The Board is satisfied that it continues to maintain an appropriate balance of skills  experience and knowledge. It is the view of the Board that each of the Non-Executive Directors standing for re-election brings considerable management experience and independent perspective to the Board's discussions and that each of the independent Non-Executive Directors standing for re-election is considered to be independent of management and free from any relationship or circumstance that could affect  or appear to affect  the exercise of their independent judgement. Bruno Deschamps and Diego Straziota are non-independent Non-Executive Directors nominated by CD&R. The Board believes that their contribution has been considerable and that they bring independent thought and challenge to the Board.The Board has confirmed  following a formal performance review  that the Directors standing for re-election make an effective and valuable contribution to the Board and are able to dedicate sufficient time to their role and responsibilities. I strongly recommend that you vote in favour of the re-election of the Directors. Biographical details of the Directors standing for re-election  including details of their contribution and how it is and continues to be important to the Company's long-term sustainable success  are included on pages 10 to 11 of this document.Re-Appointment Of Auditor And Auditor's Remuneration (Resolutions 13 and 14)The Auditor of the Company is subject to re-appointment at each Annual General Meeting. On recommendation of the Audit & Risk Committee  Resolution 13 proposes that Ernst & Young LLP be re-appointed as the Company's Auditor to hold office until the next Annual General Meeting.Resolution 14 authorises the Audit & Risk Committee to determine the external Auditor's remuneration.Political Donations (Resolution 15)Part 14 of the Companies Act 2006 (the ""Act"") requires companies to obtain shareholders' authority for political donations to registered political parties  other political organisations or an independent election candidate and for any political expenditure. The definitions of 'political donations' and 'political expenditure' under the Act are wide and as a result it is possible that they may include  for example  sponsorship  subscriptions  paid leave for employees fulfilling certain public duties and/or bodies concerned with policy review and law reform.Notwithstanding that the Company has not made a political donation in the past and has no intention either now or in the future of making any political donation or incurring any political expenditure  the Board has decided to propose Resolution 15 to shareholders to seek authority for the Company to make political donations. The Resolution will allow the Company to support the community and put forward its views to wider business and Government entities without the risk of inadvertently breaching the Act.The authority is subject to a maximum aggregate amount of £50 000 and will cover the period from the date that Resolution 15 is passed until the end of the next Annual General Meeting of the Company or  if earlier on 30 June 2025.Authority To Allot Equity Securities (Resolution 16)Resolution 16 seeks to renew the Directors' authority to allot shares.At the last Annual General Meeting of the Company held on 4 May 2023  the Directors were given authority to allot ordinary shares in the capital of the Company up to a maximum nominal amount of £78 770 466  representing approximately two-thirds of the Company's then issued ordinary share capital. This authority expires at the conclusion of the AGM. Resolution 16 will  if passed  renew this authority  in line with the guidelines published by the Investment Association (""IA"") in February 2023.The IA guidelines on Directors' authority to allot shares state that IA members will regard as routine an authority to allot up to two-thirds of the existing issued share capital  provided that any amount in excess of one-third of existing issued shares can be applied to fully pre-emptive offers only.In light of these guidelines  the Board considers it appropriate that the Directors be granted authority to allot shares in the capital of the Company up to a maximum nominal amount of £78 770 466 representing the guideline limit of approximately two-thirds of the Company's issued ordinary share capital as at 15 March 2024 (the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this document). Of this amount  a maximum nominal amount of £39 385 233 (representing approximately one-third of the Company's issued ordinary share capital) can only be allotted pursuant to a fully pre-emptive offer. The authority will last until the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting of the Company or  if earlier  30 June 2025. The Directors have no present intention of exercising this authority  however they consider it appropriate to maintain the flexibility that this authority provides.As at the date of this letter  the Company does not hold any ordinary shares in the capital of the Company in treasury.Disapplication Of Statutory Pre-Emption Rights (Resolutions 17 and 18)Resolutions 17 and 18 are proposed as Special Resolutions to give the Directors authority to allot ordinary shares in the capital of the Company pursuant to the authority granted under Resolution 16 above for cash (and/or sell any treasury shares for cash) without complying with the pre-emption rights in the Act in limited circumstances.The proposed disapplication authorities contained in Resolutions 17 and 18 are in line with institutional shareholder guidance  and in particular with the Pre-Emption Group's Statement of Principles published on 4 November 2022 (the ""2022 Statement of Principles""). The 2022 Statement of Principles allow the authority for an issue of shares for cash otherwise than in connection with a pre-emptive offer to include: (i) an authority up to ten per cent of a company's issued share capital for use on an unrestricted basis; and (ii) an additional authority up to a further ten per cent of a company's issued share capital for use in connection with an acquisition or specified capital investment announced contemporaneously with the issue  or has taken place in the twelve month period preceding the announcement of the issue. In both cases  an additional authority of up to 2% may be sought for the purposes of making a follow on offer  as further explained below.If approved  Resolution 17 will authorise the Directors  in accordance with the Company's articles of association and the 2022 Statement of Principles  to issue shares and/or sell treasury shares for cash:1) on an offer to existing shareholders subject to any adjustments  such as for fractional entitlements and overseas shareholders  as the Directors see fit (under paragraph (a) of the Resolution); or2) for general corporate purposes (under paragraph (b) of the Resolution)  up to a maximum nominal amount of £11 815 570 (representing approximately 10% of the issued share capital of the Company as at 15 March 2024 (being the latest practicable date prior to publication of this document)); and3) for the purposes of making a follow-on offer to existing shareholders (under paragraph (c) of the Resolution and as described in the 2022 Statement of Principles)  up to an additional aggregate amount equal to 20% of any allotment under paragraph (b) of the Resolution. The maximum additional nominal amount that could be issued under paragraph (c) of the Resolution (based on the authority under paragraph (b) being used in full) is £2 363 114 (representing approximately 2% of the issued share capital of the Company as at 15 March 2024).The total maximum nominal amount of equity securities to which Resolution 17 relates on a non pre-emptive basis is £14 178 684 (representing approximately 12% of the issued share capital of the Company as at 15 March 2024).Resolution 18 requests further shareholder approval  by way of a separate Special Resolution in line with best practice guidance issued by the Pre-Emption Group  for the Directors to allot equity securities and/or sell treasury shares for cash without being required to offer such securities to existing shareholders.Chairman's Letter to Shareholders / continuedThe authority granted by this Resolution  if passed  will be limited to the allotment of equity securities and the sale of treasury shares for cash in connection with an acquisition or other capital investment of a kind contemplated by the 2022 Statement of Principles  and which is announced contemporaneously with the allotment  or has taken place in the preceding 12 month period and is disclosed in the announcement of the allotment:1) under paragraph (a) of the Resolution  up to an aggregate nominal value of £11 815 570 (representing approximately 10% of the issued share capital of the Company as at 15 March 2024 (being the latest practicable date prior to publication of this document)); and2) under paragraph (b) of the Resolution  up to an additional aggregate amount equal to 20% of any allotment under paragraph (a) of the Resolution  for the purposes of making a follow-on offer to existing shareholders as described in the 2022 Statement of Principles. The maximum additional nominal amount that could be issued under paragraph (b) of the Resolution (based on the authority under paragraph (a) being used in full) is £2 363 114 (representing approximately 2% of the issued share capital of the Company as at 15 March 2024).The total maximum nominal amount of equity securities to which Resolution 18 relates is £14 178 684 (representing approximately 12% of the issued share capital of the Company as at 15 March 2024).The Directors consider that it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders generally that the Company should seek the maximum authority permitted by the 2022 Statement of Principles and have the flexibility conferred by Resolutions 17 and 18 to conduct a pre-emptive offering without complying with the strict requirements of the statutory pre-emptive provisions. However  as noted above  the Directors have no current intention of issuing ordinary shares.The Directors confirm that  should they exercise the authorities granted by Resolutions 17 and 18  they intend to follow best practice as regards to their use  including (i) following the shareholder protections in Part 2B of the 2022 Statement of Principles  and (ii) in respect of any follow-on offer  following the expected features set out in Paragraph 3 of Part 2B of the 2022 Statement of Principles.The authorities contained in Resolutions 17 and 18 will expire at the next Annual General Meeting of the Company or  if earlier 30 June 2025.Authority To Purchase Ordinary Shares (Resolution 19)It is a requirement of Section 693 of the Act that a company shall not make a market purchase of its own shares unless the purchase has first been authorised by the Company at a general meeting. Accordingly  Resolution 19 to be proposed as a Special Resolution gives the Directors power to make market purchases of the Company's shares up to a maximum amount of 118 155 698 ordinary shares (representing approximately 10% of the current issued ordinary share capital of the Company as at 15 March 2024 (the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this document)). This power will expire at the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting of the Company or  if earlier  30 June 2025. It is intended that purchases will only be made on the London Stock Exchange.The Directors consider that it is in the best interests of all shareholders that the Company should have the flexibility to make market purchases of its own shares; however  this is not intended to imply that the shares will be purchased. The Directors would make such purchases only if it would be in the best interests of shareholders generally (taking into account  for example  the financial resources of the Company  the Company's share price and future funding opportunities) and if such purchases would result in an increase in earnings per share.Listed companies purchasing their own shares are allowed to hold them in treasury as an alternative to cancelling them. No dividends are paid on shares while they are held in treasury and no voting rights attach to the treasury shares. If Resolution 19 is passed  it is the Company's intention to hold any shares purchased in treasury for use in connection with the Company's employee share schemes. However  in order to respond properly to the Company's capital requirements and prevailing market conditions  the Directors will reassess at the time of any and each actual purchase whether to hold the shares in treasury or cancel them  provided it is permitted to do so. The Company currently holds no ordinary shares in treasury.The Directors have no current intention of using the powers sought under Resolution 19  but as noted above  consider it advisable to pass this Resolution in order that they can be prepared to take advantage of future situations which may arise.As at 15 March 2024 (the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this document)  there were Directors' options outstanding over 6 104 246 ordinary shares in the capital of the Company representing 0.52% of the Company's issued ordinary share capital.If the authority to purchase the Company's ordinary shares being sought in Resolution 19  and the existing authority to purchase ordinary shares taken at last year's Annual General Meeting (which expires at the end of the AGM) were exercised in full  these options would represent 0.65% of the Company's issued ordinary share capital.Length Of Notice Of General Meetings Other Than Annual General Meetings (Resolution 20)Resolution 20 is a resolution to allow the Company to hold general meetings (other than Annual General Meetings) on 14 clear days' notice.General meetings (other than Annual General Meetings) must be held on 21 clear days' notice unless shareholders approve a shorter notice period  which cannot be less than 14 clear days. Annual General Meetings must always be held on at least 21 clear days' notice. In order to be able to call a general meeting on less than 21 clear days' notice  the Company must make a means of electronic voting available to all shareholders for that meeting. This condition is met if the company offers a facility  accessible to all shareholders  to appoint a proxy by means of a website.The Directors are proposing Resolution 20 as a Special Resolution to approve 14 clear days as the minimum period of notice for all general meetings of the Company other than Annual General Meetings. The approval of this Resolution will be effective until the end of the next Annual General Meeting of the Company  when it is intended that the approval will be renewed. The Board will consider on a case-by-case basis whether the use of the flexibility offered by the shorter notice period is merited  taking into account the circumstances  including whether the business of the meeting is time-sensitive and whether it is thought to be to the advantage of shareholders as a whole.Notice Of Publication Of Annual Report And AccountsNotice is hereby given that the SIG plc 2023 Annual Report and Accounts has been published on the Company's website atwww.sigplc.com/investors/results-reports-and-presentations.

Notice of General Meetings 20. That a general meeting of the Company  other than an annual general meeting  may be called on not less than 14 clear days' notice. By order of the Board Andrew Watkins Group General Counsel & Company Secretary 15 March 2024 SIG plc Registered Office: Adsetts House  16 Europa View  Sheffield Business Park  Sheffield S9 1XH Registered in England and Wales under Company Number: 00998314Important informationLocation1. A member entitled to attend and vote at the Meeting is entitled to appoint one or more proxies to exercise all or any of their rights to attend  speak and vote at the Meeting. A member can appoint more than one proxy in relation to the Meeting  provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attaching to different shares held by them.2. A proxy need not also be a member of the Company but must attend the Meeting in person. A Form of Proxy may accompany this Notice of Annual General Meeting and the notes to the Form of Proxy set out the details of how to appoint a proxy.3. A copy of this Notice has been sent for information only to persons who have been nominated by a member to enjoy information rights under Section 146 of the Companies Act 2006 (""Nominated Person""). The rights to appoint a proxy cannot be exercised by a Nominated Person: they can only be exercised by the member. However  a Nominated Person may have a right under an agreement between him/ her and the member by whom he/she was nominated to be appointed as a proxy for the Meeting or to have someone else so appointed. If a Nominated Person does not have such a right or does not wish to exercise it  he/she may have a right under such an agreement to give instructions to the member as to the exercise of voting rights. Nominated persons are reminded that they should contact the registered holder of their shares (and not the Company) on matters relating to their investments in the Company.4. To appoint a proxy or proxies shareholders must complete: (a) the Form of Proxy and return it  together with the power of attorney or other relevant authority (if any) under which it is signed  or a certified copy of the same to Computershare Investor Services PLC  The Pavilions  Bridgwater Road  Bristol  BS99 6ZY  or by using the reply-paid envelope provided; or (b) a CREST proxy instruction as detailed below; or (c) an online proxy appointment atwww.eproxyappointment.com (you will need your unique PIN and Shareholder Reference Number  together with the Control Number  printed on the Form of Proxy)  in each case so that it is received no later than 9.30am on 30 April 2024. The appointment of a proxy will not preclude a member from attending and voting in person. If a member attends the Meeting in person  his proxy appointment will automatically be terminated.5. A member may change proxy instructions by returning a new proxy appointment using the methods set out above. Where a member has appointed a proxy using the hard-copy Form of Proxy and would like to change the instructions using another hard-copy proxy form  please contact Computershare Investor Services PLC  The Pavilions  Bridgwater Road  Bristol  BS99 6ZY. The deadline for receipt of proxy appointments in paragraph 4 above also applies in relation to amended instructions. Any attempt to terminate or amend a proxy appointment received after the relevant deadline will be disregarded. Where two or more valid separate appointments of proxy are received in respect of the same share in respect of the same Meeting  the one which is last received shall be treated as replacing and revoking the other or others. In the case of joint holders  where more than one of the joint holders purports to appoint a proxy  only the appointment submitted by the most senior holder will be accepted. Seniority is determined by the order in which the names of the joint holders appear in the Company's register of members in respect of the joint holding (the first name being the most senior). You must inform the Company's Registrars in writing of any termination of the authority of a proxy.6. In conjunction with its Registrars  the Company has in place a facility to allow each shareholder to register proxy votes electronically. Detailed information of how to do this is set out on the Form of Proxy. A member can register proxy votes electronically by either logging on to the Registrars' website www.eproxyappointment.com and following the instructions  or CREST members may register proxy votes following the procedures set out in the CREST Manual.7. A ""Vote withheld"" is not a vote at law  which means that the vote will not be counted in the proportion of votes ""For"" and ""Against"" the relevant Resolution. A shareholder who does not give any voting instructions in relation to a Resolution should note that his/her proxy will have authority to vote or withhold a vote on that Resolution as he/she thinks fit. A proxy will also have authority to vote or to withhold a vote on any other business (including amendments to Resolutions) which properly come before the 2024 AGM as he/she thinks fit.8. CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so for the Annual General Meeting and any adjournment(s) of the Meeting by using the procedures described in the CREST Manual. CREST Personal Members or other CREST Sponsored Members and those CREST members who have appointed a voting service provider(s) should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s)  who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf. In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the CREST service to be valid  the appropriate CREST message (a ""CREST Proxy Instruction"") must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK & International's specifications and must contain the information required for such instructions  as described in the CREST Manual. The message  regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or an amendment to the instruction given by a previously appointed proxy must  in order to be valid  be transmitted so as to be received by the Company's agent (ID 3RA50) by the latest time(s) for receipt of proxy appointments set out above. For this purpose  the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST Applications Host) from which the Company's agent9. CREST members and  where applicable  their CREST sponsors or voting service providers should note that Euroclear UK & International Limited does not make available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings and limitations will therefore apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or  if the CREST member is a CREST Personal Member or sponsored member or has appointed a voting service provider(s)  to procure that his CREST sponsor or voting provider(s) take(s)) such action as is necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection  CREST members and  where applicable  their CREST sponsors or voting service providers are referred  in particular  to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings. The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001. is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. After this time any change of instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should be communicated to the appointee through other means.10.

Changes to entries on the register after this time shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend and vote (and the number of votes they may cast) at the Meeting or adjourned meeting.11. As at 15 March 2024 (the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this document)  the Company's issued share capital consists of 1 181 556 977 ordinary shares  carrying one vote each.

Any electronic communication received by the Company  including the lodgement of an electronic Form of Proxy  that is found to contain any virus will not be accepted.14. Voting on all Resolutions will be conducted by way of a poll rather than on a show of hands. This will result in a more accurate reflection of the views of shareholders by ensuring that every vote is recognised  including the votes of all shareholders who are unable to attend the Meeting but whoappoint a proxy for the Meeting. On a poll  each shareholder has one vote for every share held. As soon as practicable following the 2024 AGM  the results of the voting at the Meeting and the numbers of proxy votes cast for and against and the number of votes actively withheld in respect of each of the Resolutions will be announced via a Regulatory Information Service and also placed on the Company's websitewww.sigplc.com.15.

In accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006  each such representative may exercise (on behalf of the corporation) the same powers as the corporation could exercise if it were an individual member of the Company  provided that they do not do so in relation to the same shares.16.

The Company cannot require the members requesting the publication to pay its expenses. Any statement placed on the website must also be sent to the Company's Auditor no later than the time it makes its statement available on the website. The business which may be dealt with at the Meeting includes any statement that the Company has been required to publish on its website.17. The Company must cause to be answered at the Meeting any question relating to the business being dealt with at the Meeting which is put by a member attending the Meeting  except (i) if to do so would interfere unduly with the preparation for the Meeting or involve the disclosure of confidential information  (ii) if the answer has already been given on a website in the form of an answer to a question  or (iii) if it is undesirable in the interests of the Company or the good order of the Meeting that the question be answered. Shareholders are reminded that unacceptable behaviour will not be tolerated at the Meeting and will be dealt with appropriately by the Chairman.18.

A member entitled to attend and vote at the Annual General Meeting may appoint the Chair of the meeting or another person as his or her proxy  although the Chair will not speak for the member. A member who wishes his or her proxy to speak for him or her should appoint his or her own choice of proxy (not the Chair of the meeting) and give instructions directly to that person.(b) A Form of Proxy which may be used to make this appointment and give proxy instructions accompanies this notice. Details of how to appoint a proxy are set out in the notes to the Form of Proxy. If you do not have a Form of Proxy and believe that you should have one  or if you require additional forms  please contact the Company's Registrar  Computershare Investor Services PLC (""Computershare"") with the contact details found in Note (e).

In the case of a member which is a company  the revocation notice must be executed under its common seal or signed on its behalf by an ofﬁcer of the company or an attorney for the company. Any power of attorney or any other authority under which the revocation notice is signed (or a duly certiﬁed copy of such power or authority) must be included with the revocation notice. The deadline for receipt of proxy appointments (see above) also applies in relation to a revocation notice. If a member attempts to revoke his or her proxy appointment but the revocation is received after the time speciﬁed  then subject to Note (f) below  the proxy appointment will remain valid.(d) In the case of joint holders  where more than one of the joint holders purports to appoint a proxy  only the appointment submitted by the most senior holder will be accepted. Seniority is determined by the order in which the names of the joint holders appear in the Company's register of members in respect of the joint holding (the ﬁrst-named being the most senior).(e) You may submit your proxy electronically atwww.investorcentre.co.uk/eproxy. To do this  please register your proxy vote electronically by accessing our Registrar's websitewww.investorcentre.co.uk/eproxy  using control number 918388  Shareholder Reference Number (SRN) and PIN  all of which are available on the front of your Form of Proxy or within the email received from Computershare (if applicable). If you need help with voting  please contact Computershare on +44 (0)370 703 6253. Calls from outside the United Kingdom will be charged at the applicable international rate. Computershare can be contacted by phone 8:30 am to 5:30 pm (UK time)  Monday to Friday (excluding public bank holidays in England and Wales) or via email atwebqueries@computershare.co.uk.(f) If you are a person who has been nominated under section 146 of the Companies Act 2006 (the ""Companies Act"") to enjoy information rights (""Nominated Person"")  you do not have a right to appoint any proxies under the procedures set out in these Notes. However: - you may have a right under an agreement between you and the member of the Company who has nominated you to have information rights (""Relevant Member"") to be appointed or to have someone else appointed as a proxy for the Annual General Meeting; or - if you either do not have such a right or if you have such a right but do not wish to exercise it  you may have a right under an agreement between you and the Relevant Member to give instructions to the Relevant Member as to the exercise of voting rights. Your main point of contact in terms of your investment in the Company remains the Relevant Member (or perhaps your custodian or broker) and you should continue to contact them (and not the Company) regarding any changes or queries relating to your personal details and your interest in the Company (including any administrative matters). The only exception to this is where the Company expressly requests a response from you.(g) CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so by using the procedures described in the CREST manual (available viawww.euroclear.com). CREST personal members or other CREST sponsored members  and those CREST members who have appointed a voting service provider(s)  should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf.In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the CREST service to be valid  the appropriate CREST message (""CREST Proxy Instruction"") must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK & International Limited's (""EUI"") speciﬁcations and must contain the information required for such instructions  as described in the CREST manual. The message  regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or an amendment to the instruction given to a previously appointed proxy must  in order to be valid  be transmitted so as to be received by the issuer's agent Computershare Investor Services PLC (under CREST ID number 3RA50)  no later than 3:00 pm on 17 May 2024  or  if the Annual General Meeting is adjourned  not less than 48 hours (excluding any part of a day which is not a working day) prior to the adjourned meeting. For this purpose  the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST applications host) from which the issuer's agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST.After this time any change of instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should be communicated to the appointee through other means. CREST members and  where applicable  their CREST sponsors or voting service providers should note that EUI does not make available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings and limitations will therefore apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or  if the CREST member is a CREST personal member or sponsored member or has appointed a voting service provider(s)  to procure that his or her CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection  CREST members and  where applicable  their CREST sponsors or voting service provider(s) are referred  in particular  to those sections of the CREST manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings. The Group may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the Uncertiﬁcated Securities Regulations 2001.(h) A corporation which is a member can appoint one or more corporate representatives who may exercise  on its behalf  all its powers as a member provided that no more than one corporate representative exercises powers over the same share.(i) Only those holders of the Company's shares registered on the Register of Members of the Company as at 6:00 pm (UK time) on 17 May 2024 or  in the event that the Annual General Meeting is adjourned  on the Register of Members 48 hours (excluding any part of a day which is not a working day) before the time of any adjourned meeting  shall be entitled to attend and vote at the Annual General Meeting. Changes to entries on the Register of Members after this time shall be disregarded in determining the right of any person to attend and vote at the Annual General Meeting.(j) Voting on resolutions 1 to 13 will be conducted by way of a poll. As soon as practicable following the Annual General Meeting  the results of the voting will be announced via a regulatory information service and posted on the Company's website.(k) A vote withheld is not a vote in law  which means that the vote will not be counted in the calculation of votes for or against the resolution. If no voting indication is given  the proxy will vote or abstain from voting at his or her discretion. The proxy will vote (or abstain from voting) as he or she thinks ﬁt in relation to any other matter which is put before the Annual General Meeting.(l) Under section 319A of the Companies Act  the Company must answer any question a member asks relating to the business being dealt with at the Annual General Meeting unless: - answering the question would interfere unduly with the preparation for the Annual General Meeting or involve the disclosure of conﬁdential information; - the answer has already been given on a website in the form of an answer to a question; or - it is undesirable in the interests of the Company or the good order of the Annual General Meeting that the question be answered.(m) Except as provided above  members who have general queries about the Annual General Meeting should write to the Company Secretary at the registered ofﬁce set out above.(n) As at 22 March 2024 (being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this Notice)  the Company's issued share capital comprised 332 192 361 Ordinary Shares and the total number of voting rights in the Company was 332 192 361. Information regarding the number of shares and voting rights and  if applicable  any members' statements  members' resolutions or members' matters of business received by the Company after the date of this Notice will be available on the Company's website http://www.ussolarfund.co.uk.(o) Members may not use any electronic address provided either in this Notice of Annual General Meeting  or any related documents (including the Form of Proxy)  to communicate with the Company for any purposes other than those expressly stated.(p) Under section 338 of the Companies Act  members meeting the threshold requirements set out in that section have the right to require the Company to give notice of a resolution which may properly be moved at the Annual General Meeting. Any such request  which must comply with section 338(4) of the Companies Act  must be received by the Company no later than six weeks before the date ﬁxed for the Annual General Meeting.(q) Under section 338A of the Companies Act  members meeting the threshold requirements set out in that section have the right to require the Company to include a matter (other than a proposed resolution) in the business to be dealt with at the Annual General Meeting. Any such request  which must comply with section 338A(4) of the Companies Act  must be received by the Company no later than six weeks before the date ﬁxed for the Annual General Meeting.(r) Members satisfying the thresholds in section 527 of the Companies Act can require the Company to publish a statement on its website setting out any matter relating to (a) the audit of the Company's accounts (including the Auditor's report and the conduct of the audit) that are to be laid before the Annual General Meeting; or (b) any circumstances connected with an auditor of the Company ceasing to hold ofﬁce since the last annual general meeting  that the members propose to raise at this Annual General Meeting. The Company cannot require the members requesting the publication to pay its expenses. Any statement placed on the website must also be sent to the Company's Auditor no later than the time it makes its statement available on the website. The business which may be dealt with at the Annual General Meeting includes any such statement that the Company has been required to publish on its website.EXPLANATORY NOTES TO RESOLUTIONSORDINARY RESOLUTIONSRESOLUTION 1: RECEIVE THE ANNUAL REPORT AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTSThe Companies Act requires the Directors of a public company to lay before the Company in general meeting copies of the Annual Report  Directors' Reports and its Auditor's Report in respect of each ﬁnancial year. These are contained in the Company's Annual Report and ﬁnancial statements for the ﬁnancial year ended 31 December 2023 (the ""2023 Annual Report""). Accordingly  a resolution to receive the 2023 Annual Report is included as an ordinary resolution.RESOLUTION 2: APPROVE THE DIRECTORS' REMUNERATION REPORTThe Directors' remuneration report can be found on pages 71 to 72 of the 2023 Annual Report and is subject to an advisory vote by Shareholders  which is proposed as an ordinary resolution. It details the payments that have been made to Directors during the year  in accordance with the current remuneration policy. The remuneration report will be presented to Shareholders on an annual basis.At the annual general meeting held in 2023  the Directors' remuneration policy was approved by Shareholders and is not therefore required to be approved at this year's Annual General Meeting. The policy will be put to Shareholders again no later than the Company's annual general meeting in 2026.RESOLUTIONS 3 AND 4: RE-APPOINTMENT OF AUDITOR AND AUDITOR'S REMUNERATIONResolution 3 relates to the re-appointment of Deloitte LLP as the Company's Auditor to hold ofﬁce until the conclusion of the next general meeting of the Company at which the accounts and reports of the Directors and Auditor are laid. This resolution is recommended by the Company's Audit Committee and endorsed by the Board. Accordingly  it is proposed  as an ordinary resolution  to re-appoint Deloitte LLP as the Company's Auditor. Resolution 4 authorises the Directors  upon recommendation from the Company's Audit Committee  to ﬁx the Auditor's remuneration.The Directors  having regard to the Audit Committee's recommendation  consider that the level of consultancy-related non-audit fees to audit fees paid to Deloitte LLP is appropriate for the advisory work required to be undertaken for the year to 31 December 2023 and that these do not create a conﬂict of interest on the part of the independent Auditor.RESOLUTIONS 5 TO 7: RE-ELECTION OF DIRECTORSThe Company's articles of association (the ""Articles"") specify that at each annual general meeting all of the Directors shall retire from ofﬁce. Accordingly  each of the existing Directors will retire from ofﬁce with effect from the conclusion of this Annual General Meeting and Gillian Nott  Jamie Richards and Thomas Plagemann will stand for re-election by the Shareholders. Rachael Nutter is not seeking re-election at the Annual General Meeting and will cease to be a Director of the Company from conclusion of the meeting.Biographies of each member of the Board standing for re-election can be found on page 59 of the 2023 Annual Report.The Directors believe that the Board has an appropriate balance of skills  experience  independence and knowledge of the Company and the sector in which it operates to enable it to provide effective strategic leadership and proper guidance of the Company. The Board confirms that  following the evaluation process set out in the Corporate Governance Report on pages 62 to 66 of the 2023 Annual Report  the performance of each of the Directors is  and continues to be  effective and demonstrates their respective commitment to the role. The Board believes  therefore  that it is in the interests of Shareholders that Gillian Nott  Jamie Richards and Thomas Plagemann be re-elected.RESOLUTION 8: APPROVAL OF THE DIVIDEND POLICYResolution 8 concerns the approval of the Company's dividend policy which is to pay interim quarterly dividends to the holders of Ordinary Shares  in US Dollars.RESOLUTION 9: AUTHORITY TO ALLOT SHARESThis resolution deals with the Directors authority to allot Ordinary Shares generally and unconditionally in accordance with section 551 of the Companies Act up to an aggregate nominal value of US$ 332 200  or 10% of the Company's issued ordinary share capital.Resolution 9 along with Special Resolution 10 as described below  intends to authorise the Board to allot shares in the capital of the Company and to grant rights to subscribe to  or to convert any security into shares on a non pre-emptive basis.SPECIAL RESOLUTIONSRESOLUTION 10: DISAPPLICATION OF STATUTORY PRE-EMPTION RIGHTSResolution 10 will be proposed as a special resolution  which require a majority of at least 75% to be passed. The Resolution seeks to provide the Directors the authority to allot shares or sell shares held in treasury under Resolution 9  on a non-pre-emptive basis for cash up to an aggregate nominal amount of US$ 332 200  or 10% of the issued ordinary share capital (excluding treasury shares) as at the date the resolution would have passed.RESOLUTION 11: MARKET PURCHASES OF OWN SHARESThis resolution seeks authority for the Company to make market purchases of its own Ordinary Shares and is proposed as a special resolution. If passed  the resolution gives authority for the Company to purchase up to 49 795 646 of its Ordinary Shares  being approximately 14.99% of the Company's issued ordinary share capital (excluding treasury shares) as at 22 March 2024 (being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this Notice).The resolution speciﬁes the minimum and maximum prices which may be paid for any Ordinary Shares purchased under this authority. The authority will expire on the earlier of 15 months from the passing of the resolution and the Company's next annual general meeting.The Directors believe that it is prudent to obtain the ﬂexibility that this resolution provides; and will only exercise the authority to purchase Ordinary Shares where they consider that such purchases will be in the best interests of Shareholders generally and will result in an increase in earnings per Ordinary Share.The Company may either cancel any shares it purchases under this authority or transfer them into treasury (and subsequently sell or transfer them out of treasury or cancel them). The Directors currently intend to cancel all shares purchased under this authority.As at 22 March 2024  there are no outstanding options or warrants to subscribe for Ordinary Shares in the capital of the Company.RESOLUTION 12: NOTICE PERIOD FOR GENERAL MEETINGSResolution 12 is to be proposed as a special resolution to allow the Company to hold general meetings (other than annual general meetings) on at least 14 clear days' notice.The minimum notice period for general meetings of listed companies is 21 days  but companies may reduce this period to 14 days (other than for annual general meetings) provided that two conditions are met. The ﬁrst condition is that the Company offers a facility for Shareholders to vote by electronic means. This condition is met if the Company offers a facility  accessible to all Shareholders  to appoint a proxy by means of a website. The second condition is that there is an annual resolution of Shareholders approving the reduction of the minimum notice period from 21 days to 14 days.If approved  the resolution will be effective until the end of the Company's next annual general meeting  when it is intended that the approval be renewed. The Board will consider on a case-by-case basis whether the use of the ﬂexibility offered by the shorter notice period is merited  taking into account the circumstances  including whether the business of the meeting is time sensitive.RESOLUTION 13: DISCONTINUATION RESOLUTIONThe Company's Articles require the Directors to propose to Shareholders a special resolution that the Company ceases to continue in its present form (""Discontinuation Resolution"") if over the course of a complete ﬁnancial year  the Ordinary Shares of the Company have  on average  traded at a discount in excess of 10 percent to the Net Asset Value per Ordinary Share.During the period  the Company's average price per Ordinary Share was 65.55 cents  trading at a 28.13 percent discount to the Company's average Net Asset Value as at 31 December 2023  triggering the requirement to propose the Discontinuation Resolution to Shareholders.Accordingly  the Discontinuation Resolution will be put to Shareholders at the upcoming Annual General Meeting. If the Discontinuation Resolution is passed  the Board will put forward proposals to Shareholders at a general meeting of the Company  to be held within four months of the Discontinuation Resolution being passed  to wind up or otherwise reconstruct the Company  having regard to the illiquid nature of the Company's underlying assets.Notwithstanding the obligation on the Board to propose the Discontinuation Resolution pursuant to the Company's Articles  the Board ﬁrmly believes that the passing of the Discontinuation Resolution would have a signiﬁcant adverse impact on Shareholder value for the reasons set out below.The Company underwent an extensive strategic review process during the period to consider the options available to protect Shareholder value (the ""Strategic Review""). As a result of the Strategic Review  the Company made amendments to its investment policy and appointed a new Investment Manager  Amber Infrastructure Investment Advisor  LLC (a member of the Amber Infrastructure Group) (""Amber"")  with effect from 1 December 2023. The Board believes that the appointment of Amber  with its extensive expertise  will be able to maximise Shareholder value and place the Company in a stronger position in future. The Strategic Review conducted throughout 2023  demonstrated that prevailing market conditions are not conducive to the Company realising the value of its assets. The Board therefore strongly recommends that Shareholders allow the Company to continue  so as to allow the investment strategy under Amber's management to deliver results.In light of the severity of the possible consequences for Shareholder value  the Directors are unanimously recommending that Shareholders vote AGAINST the Discontinuation Resolution.",neutral,0.02,0.97,0.01,neutral,0.04,0.91,0.05,True,English,"['US Solar Fund', 'Notice', 'AGM', 'March', '03:29', 'next Annual General Meeting general meeting', 'US Solar Fund plc', 'maximum aggregate nominal amount', 'aggregate nominal value', 'independent ﬁnancial advice', 'independent ﬁnancial adviser', 'net asset value', 'other ﬁnancial adviser', 'latest practicable date', 'ordinary share capital', 'Annual Report', ""Directors' Remuneration Report"", 'other agent', 'Ordinary Shares', 'IMMEDIATE ATTENTION', 'Financial Services', 'United Kingdom', 'accompanying documents', 'ofﬁces', 'The Scalpel', '18th Floor', '52 Lime Street', 'London EC3M', 'Financial Statements', 'Remuneration Policy', 'Deloitte LLP', 'Gillian Nott', 'Jamie Richards', 'Thomas Plagemann', 'dividend policy', 'existing authorities', 'relevant securities', 'equity securities', 'ordinary resolutions', 'treasury shares', ""Auditors' report"", 'bank manager', 'special resolutions', 'Markets Act', 'Companies Act', ""Directors' reports"", 'NOTICE', 'AGM', 'doubt', 'action', 'stockbroker', 'solicitor', 'accountant', 'purchaser', 'transferee', 'sale', 'delivery', 'JTC', 'Tuesday', 'May', 'Board', 'Shareholders', 'favour', 'case', 'year', '31 December', 'accounts', 'pages', 'conclusion', 'Section', 'substitution', 'powers', '22 March', 'publication', 'number', 'passing', 'authority', 'time', 'expiry', 'offers', 'agreements', 'arrangements', 'pursuance', 'meaning', 'way', 'allotment', 'cash', 'price', '3:00']",2024-03-25,2024-03-26,marketscreener.com

This letter explains the business of the meeting.Shareholder engagementThe Board welcomes shareholder participation and engagement in the AGM process  and throughout the year. Shareholders who choose to attend the AGM in-person  or their proxies will have the opportunity to put questions to the Board. If you are unable to attend the AGM  or if you would like to submit a question to the Board in advance of the meeting  please email your question tocompany.secretarial@persimmonhomes.com.The AGM will be an in-person meeting; shareholders or their proxies are most welcome to attend. Whilst other meeting formats (e.g. hybrid meetings) are available  the Board has concluded that an in-person AGM is currently the most appropriate meeting format for the Company and its shareholder base. The Board will keep this matter under review for future AGMs. Further details regarding the Board's decision on the format of the meeting can be found in note 16 of the Notice.Business of the meetingThe business of the AGM is set out below  the ordinary resolutions 1 to 15 and the special resolutions 16 to 19 are summarised and explained below.Report and Accounts  and declaration of a dividend: Resolutions 1 and 2Resolution 1 is for shareholders to receive and adopt the Directors' and Auditor's Reports and Financial Statements for the financial year ended 31 December 2023.Resolution 2 is to declare a final dividend of 40p per ordinary share for the year ended 31 December 2023  as recommended by the Directors. If approved  the final dividend will be paid on 12 July 2024 to shareholders on the Register of Members at the close of business on 21 June 2024.Directors' Remuneration - Annual Report on Remuneration: Resolution 3Resolution 3 is to seek shareholders' approval for the Annual Report on Remuneration for the year ended 31 December 2023 (other than the part summarising the Remuneration Policy)  which is set out on pages 118 to 138 of the Annual Report 2023. The Annual Report on Remuneration sets out how the Directors were paid in the year to 31 December 2023 and how it is proposed to implement the Remuneration Policy in 2024. The shareholder vote on the Annual Report on Remuneration resolution will be advisory and no entitlement of a Director to remuneration is conditional on it.Re-election and election of Directors: Resolutions 4 to 11Resolutions 4 to 11 concern the re-election and election of Directors by shareholders. In accordance with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code 2018  all of the Directors will retire at the AGM and offer themselves for re-election (or in the case of Alexandra Depledge and Colette O'Shea  who were appointed to the Board since the last AGM  election by shareholders for the first time).Following individual performance evaluations  the Board supports the re-election or election of the Directors. The Board considers each of the Non-Executive Directors seeking re-election or election to be independent.The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors have individually performed well in their duties and have shown a high level of independence and commitment to their roles. Their collective experience allows them to make valuable contributions to Board discussions  providing insight  strategic guidance  a diversity of views and constructive challenge to the executive team.The Board also considers that the Group Chief Executive has performed well in his role during the year. Dean Finch continues to demonstrate strong leadership of the business with his focus on build quality  customer care  stakeholder value  sustainability and strong long-term returns to shareholders.It is the Board's view that the biographies  which set out the experience  skills and contribution of each of the Directors seeking re-election or election  show why each Director's contribution is  and continues to be  important to the Company's long term sustainable success.The biographies can be found in Appendix 1 to this letter.Appointment of Auditor: Resolution 12Resolution 12 is for the re-appointment by shareholders of Ernst & Young LLP as auditor. This resolution is recommended to the Board by the Audit & Risk Committee. Ernst & Young LLP were appointed as the Group's auditor in April 2016. The Audit & Risk Committee assesses the performance of the external auditor on an ongoing basis  with a formal review conducted annually. The Committee takes into consideration the quality and depth of the auditor's reporting  their planning and strategy for undertaking the audit and the quality of the personnel undertaking the audit. The Audit & Risk Committee continues to consider that the auditor and the lead audit partner remain independent and that the performance of the auditor remains satisfactory. Further information can be found on page 112 of the Annual Report 2023.Remuneration of Auditor: Resolution 13Resolution 13 is for shareholders to authorise the Audit & Risk Committee to determine the auditor's remuneration.Authority to make political donations and incur political expenditure: Resolution 14Under the Companies Act 2006 (the 'Act')  a company must not make political donations or incur political expenditure  unless authorised by shareholders.The Company and its subsidiaries do not make political donations  nor do they incur political expenditure  and they have no intention to do so.However  the definitions of 'political party'  'political organisation'  'political donation' and 'political expenditure' within the Act are very wide. The Company and its subsidiaries may incur expenditure such as advertising  sponsorship  subscriptions or attendance at events organised by political parties  industry bodies or charities  paid leave for employees fulfilling certain public duties or support for bodies representing the business community  which may fall within the wide definitions of the Act.Whilst the Board does not regard these activities as political in nature  given the broad definitions contained within the Act  resolution 14 is tabled as a precautionary measure to ensure that the Company and its subsidiaries do not inadvertently breach the requirements of the Act.Authority to Allot Shares: Resolution 15Resolution 15  which will be proposed as an ordinary resolution  is to give the Directors authority to allot shares and grant rights to subscribe for  or convert any security into  shares.Guidelines published by the Investment Association (the 'IA') in February 2023 state that IA members will permit  and treat as routine  resolutions seeking authority to allot shares representing up to two thirds of the Company's issued share capital  provided that any amount in excess of one third of the Company's issued share capital should only be used to allot shares pursuant to a fully pre-emptive offer (including a rights issue or open offer).Accordingly  this resolution would allow the Directors to allot shares: (a) up to a maximum nominal amount of £10 647 543 representing approximately one third of the Company's existing issued share capital as at 11 March 2024  being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this document; and (b) in connection with a fully pre-emptive offer only (including a rights issue or open offer)  up to an aggregate nominal amount of £21 295 086 (as reduced by allotments under paragraph (a) of this resolution)  representing (before any reduction) approximately two thirds of the Company's existing issued ordinary share capital as at 11 March 2024  being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this document.The Directors have no present intention of using the authority given to allot further shares  but would prefer to have the flexibility to do so  should the need arise. If they do exercise the authority  the Directors intend to follow emerging best practice and take note of relevant corporate governance guidelines as regards its use.The Company holds no Ordinary Shares in treasury as at 11 March 2024  being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this document. This authority will  if granted  expire at the conclusion of the AGM to be held in 2025 or  if earlier  on 30 June 2025.Renewal of Section 561 Power: Resolutions 16 and 17Under section 561 of the Act  any shares allotted (or  in the case of any shares held in treasury  sold) wholly for cash must be offered to existing shareholders in proportion to their holdings  but this requirement may be modified by a special resolution of the shareholders in a general meeting.The power given at the AGM held on 26 April 2023 will expire at the end of the forthcoming AGM and resolutions 16 and 17 seek to obtain new powers.These resolutions  which will be proposed as special resolutions  would give the Directors the power to allot equity securities (or sell any treasury shares) for cash without first offering them to existing shareholders in proportion to their existing shareholdings.In November 2022  the Pre-Emption Group updated its Statement of Principles to state that a company may seek authority by special resolution to issue non-pre-emptively for cash equity securities representing: (a) no more than 10% of issued ordinary share capital in any one year  with a further authority of no more than 2% to be used only for the purposes of a follow-on offer; and (b) no more than an additional 10% of issued ordinary share capital provided that the company intends to use it only in connection with an acquisition or specified capital investment  with a further authority of no more than 2% to be used only for the purposes of a follow-on offer.Accordingly  the power under resolution 16 would be limited to: (a) pre-emptive offers  including rights issues or open offers  and offers to holders of other equity securities if required by the rights of those shares or as the Directors otherwise consider necessary; (b) otherwise  allotments and sales up to a nominal amount of £3 194 262  representing approximately 10% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company as at 11 March 2024  being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this document; and (c) allotments or sales up to an additional aggregate nominal amount equal to 20% of any allotments or sales made under (b) above  such power to be used only for the purposes of making a follow-on offer of a kind contemplated by Section 2B of the Pre-emption Group's 2022 Statement of Principles (with any such follow-on offer therefore being limited to a maximum of 2% of the Company's total issued share capital).The power under resolution 17 is in addition to that proposed by resolution 16 and would be limited to: (a) allotments up to a nominal amount of £3 194 262 in connection with an acquisition or specified capital investment (within the meaning given in the Pre-Emption Group's 2022 Statement of Principles)  representing approximately 10% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company (excluding treasury shares) as at 11 March 2024  the latest practicable date prior to publication of this document; and (b) allotments or sales up to an additional aggregate nominal amount equal to 20% of any allotments or sales made under (a) above  such power to be used only for the purposes of making a follow-on offer of a kind contemplated by Section 2B of the Pre-emption Group's 2022 Statement of Principles (with any such follow-on offer therefore being limited to a maximum of 2% of the Company's total issued share capital).The Directors will have due regard to the relevant Pre-Emption Group's 2022 Statement of Principles in relation to any exercise of the powers sought pursuant to resolutions 16 and 17. In particular  the Directors confirm their intention to follow the shareholder protections in paragraph 1 of Part 2B of the Statement of Principles and  where relevant  follow the expected features of a follow-on offer as set out in paragraph 3 of Part 2B of the Statement of Principles.In respect of the power under resolution 17  the Directors confirm that they will only allot shares pursuant to this power where the acquisition or specified capital investment is announced contemporaneously with the announcement of the issue  or has taken place in the preceding 12-month period and is disclosed in the announcement of the issue.The powers under resolutions 16 and 17 will expire at the conclusion of the AGM to be held in 2025 or  if earlier  at the close of business on 30 June 2025.Authority for the Company to purchase its own Ordinary Shares: Resolution 18The Directors consider it would be beneficial for the Company to continue to have the power to purchase its own Ordinary Shares in certain circumstances. The current authority expires at the conclusion of the AGM. If the authority were to be renewed and exercised  the Company would be able to purchase Ordinary Shares and either cancel them (so reducing the total number of Ordinary Shares in issue) or hold them as treasury shares in accordance with the Act  subject to certain limitations. Treasury shares themselves may be cancelled  sold or transferred for the purposes of the Company's employee share schemes. All rights attaching to Ordinary Shares  including voting rights and the right to receive dividends  are suspended while they are held in treasury.Resolution 18  which will be proposed as a special resolution  would authorise the Directors to purchase up to a maximum of 31 942 629 Ordinary Shares  being 10% of the issued share capital of the Company as at 11 March 2024  being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this document.The maximum and minimum prices are stated in the resolution. The Directors would only implement purchases of Ordinary Shares if  after careful consideration  they were satisfied that such purchases would be in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders generally and would result in an increase in expected earnings per share.The Company would consider either retaining any of its Ordinary Shares which it has purchased as treasury shares with a possible re-issue at a further later date  or cancelling them. If such purchases are made  to the extent the purchased Ordinary Shares are held as treasury shares  any increase in earnings per share might only be temporary  depending on whether the Ordinary Shares in question are cancelled  sold or transferred out of treasury.As at 11 March 2024  being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this document  options and awards to acquire Ordinary Shares granted under the Company's employee share schemes were outstanding over a total of 5 908 711 Ordinary Shares  being equivalent to 1.85% of the issued share capital of the Company at that date. If the Directors were to be granted this authority to purchase Ordinary Shares and were to use it and the existing authority in full and subsequently cancel such Ordinary Shares  the outstanding options and awards would be equal to 2.31% of the then issued share capital of the Company.No shares have been purchased to date under the current authority and the Directors have no present intention of exercising the authority to purchase Ordinary Shares  but consider it would be beneficial for the Company to continue to have this power.This authority will  if granted  expire at the conclusion of the AGM to be held in 2025 or  if earlier  on 30 June 2025.Notice period for general meetings: Resolution 19Resolution 19  which will be proposed as a special resolution  allows the Company to hold general meetings  other than AGMs  on 14 clear days' notice. Under the Act   the minimum notice period for listed company general meetings is 21 clear days  but with an ability for companies to reduce this period to 14 clear days (other than for AGMs) provided that certain conditions are met.One condition is that the Company offers a facility for shareholders to vote by electronic means. This condition is met if the Company offers a facility allowing shareholders to appoint a proxy by means of a website. The Company provides this facility (please refer to 'Recommendation and action to be taken' below and note 4 of the Notice). The other condition is that there is an annual resolution of shareholders approving the reduction of the minimum notice period from 21 clear days to 14 clear days.The Directors consider it would be beneficial to the Company to continue to have the ability to call general meetings on 14 clear days' notice. The Directors do not propose to utilise this shorter notice period as a matter of routine but only for time-sensitive  non-routine business and where to do so would  in the Directors' opinion  be in the interest of the shareholders as a whole. This authority  if granted  would expire at the conclusion of the AGM of the Company to be held in 2025  when it is intended that a similar resolution will be proposed. AGMs will continue to be held on at least 21 clear days' notice.Recommendation and action to be takenShareholders are encouraged to vote on the resolutions  either in person at the AGM or by Proxy. If you are unable to attend the meeting  you are urged to complete a Form of Proxy and return it to the Company's Registrars  Computershare Investor Services PLC  either by post to The Pavilions  Bridgwater Road  Bristol BS99 6ZY or online atwww.eproxyappointment.comor by submitting a CREST Proxy Instruction  by no later than 11.00 am on 23 April 2024.The appointment of a proxy will not prevent a shareholder from attending the AGM and voting in person if he or she is entitled to do so and so wishes.If you are an institutional investor you may also be able to appoint a proxy electronically via the Proxymity platform  a process which has been agreed by the Company and approved by the Registrar. For further information regarding Proxymity  please go towww.proxymity.io.The Directors consider that the proposed resolutions are in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders as a whole and recommend shareholders vote in favour of the resolutions set out in the Notice  as they intend to do in respect of their own beneficial holdings which  as at 11 March 2024  being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this document  amounted to 51 115 Ordinary Shares  being 0.02% of the issued share capital.Yours faithfullyRoger Devlin Chairman25 March 2024Appendix 1: Directors' biographiesCommittee keyCommittee ChairN Nomination CommitteeS Sustainability CommitteeAR Audit & Risk CommitteeR Remuneration CommitteeW Workforce Non-Executive DirectorCF Trustee of the Persimmon CharitableFoundationRoger Devlin N CFChairman (age 66)Date of appointment: 1 June 2018Experience and external appointments: Roger was independent on appointment and has extensive business  leadership and governance experience  having held executive and non-executive roles in a variety of sectors such as corporate finance  gaming  leisure  pubs and brewing  sport and transport.Roger is a highly experienced Board Director  having previously served as Chairman of William Hill PLC  Chairman of Marston's PLC and as Senior Independent Director at the Football Association.In May 2022 Roger was appointed to the Board of The Sutton Trust  a charity designed to improve social mobility and address educational disadvantage.Skills and contribution: Roger's wealth of experience gives him a strong understanding of corporate governance  shareholder and stakeholder views  banking and finance  customer propositions and leadership.Roger's expertise and personal qualities enable him to effectively lead the Board and drive change within the business.

The Company may not require the shareholders requesting any such website publication to pay its expenses in complying with sections 527 or 528 of the Companies Act 2006. Where the Company is required to place a statement on a website under section 527 Companies Act 2006  it must forward the statement to the Company's auditor not later than the time when it makes the statement available on the website. The business which may be dealt with at the AGM includes any statement that the Company has been required under section 527 of the Companies Act 2006 to publish on a website.14.

We note that in recent years some companies have chosen to hold their AGMs as ""hybrid meetings""  which allow both in-person and live electronic attendance by shareholders and their proxies. Having considered the advantages and disadvantages of hybrid meetings  the Board has concluded that in-person AGMs currently remain the most appropriate format for the Company and its shareholder base. While hybrid meetings do have the potential to increase shareholder attendance and participation in the AGM process  in advance of our 2021 AGM  we held a Virtual Shareholder Engagement Event  which shareholders were able to attend electronically to put questions to the Board; all shareholders were invited  but only three chose to attend. The Board will keep this matter under review for future AGMs and we welcome any feedback shareholders may have.

Credit: APIt said the first payment of about €3 billion (almost $5 billion) to Ukraine could occur as soon as July 1  with  depending on the prevailing interest rates  two payments a year totalling €2.5 billion to €3 billion in future. Last year  Euroclear generated €3.25 billion of after-tax profits on the Russian funds.Where the original discussion about accessing Russia’s assets centred on using the funds for the reconstruction of Ukraine  the new plan  which has been agreed in principle  is to funnel the interest through a special EU budget allocation known as the European Peace Facility  which is dedicated to funding Ukraine’s military.,negative,0.04,0.44,0.52,negative,0.07,0.35,0.58,True,English,"['$350 billion Russian safe', 'delicate plan', 'Banditry', 'theft', 'special EU budget allocation', 'Russian central bank assets', 'past six months', 'Belgium-based clearing house', 'European Peace Facility', 'The European Union', 'prevailing interest rates', 'The Kremlin', 'Russian funds', 'major step', 'intense debates', 'larger part', 'first payment', 'two payments', 'original discussion', 'new plan', 'Ukraine', 'defence', 'West', 'onset', 'war', 'Euroclear', 'banditry', 'theft', 'Credit', 'AP', 'July', 'future', 'tax', 'profits', 'reconstruction', 'principle', 'military']",2024-03-26,2024-03-26,smh.com.au

38085,Clearstream,Bing API,https://www.digitaltrends.com/home-theater/best-long-range-tv-antennas/,The 4 best long range TV antennas in 2024,OTA broadcast stations are providing free entertainment. But what if there aren't any nearby? These long range TV antennas are the solution you're looking for.,TV antennas are a rising  but quite surprising  way to get great programming for free in 2024. It is in large part due to the advent of ATSC 3.0  a new broadcast standard that will make even over-the-air broadcasts appear beautifully on your 4K TV. This seemingly archaic tech still has a ton of broadcast stations throughout the country supporting it. There may even be one in your area! But what if there aren’t any nearby? Long range TV antennas are the solution you’re looking for.For this guide  we’re looking at the best TV antennas that get more range than typical for their form factor. This can mean the super long range antennas that comprise the best TV antennas for rural areas  but also indoor TV antennas that get more range than you might otherwise expect. The reasoning behind this is two-fold  not everyone can use a rooftop antenna and there are some form factors not typically known for range that will include some outliers. Look just below for our short but quick listing of the best long range TV antennas  then keep reading our a more lengthy analysis of their strengths and weaknesses  plus an extensive guide to how to pick a quality long range TV antenna.Note: Due to the shape of the Earth  the longest range you should expect to get from any TV antenna is about 70-80 miles. Estimated ranges further than this are manufacturer supplied theoretical distances based on perfect situations that likely won’t apply to your home.The best long range TV antennas of 2024Buy the if you’re looking for a complete set to get you started.if you’re looking for a complete set to get you started.

Its four coil bi-directional design is powerful and capable of receiving very clear streams  and it has all of the fixings to support it. A compatible 3-way splitter included in the kit will make sure your entire household is covered and an amplifier switch gives you easy amplification access  should you like to try the technology.We also feel very confident in Antennas Direct’s ability to provide a long range  perhaps even further than 70 miles should you need it and have the real estate that could theoretically support it (i.e. you live atop high mountains). That’s because Antennas Direct is very upfront about the limitations of satellite TV antennas and rates the estimated range of their TV antennas with an upfront policy that emphasizes realistic geographical expectations over unworldly theoretical extrapolations.It is the combination of completeness  honesty about the limitations of the product and the technology  and consistent customer approval of the end result that places the ClearStream 4MAX kit at the top of the charts. You’re getting a reliable kit with everything you need  after all. Yet  at the same time  this set is going to be more expensive than others and lacks unidirectional support. But  if you can’t stand to search for your own coax cables for a TV antenna and get all of the switchers and make sure it fits together in a compatible manner  this is the product for you.Key Specifications Estimated range 70 miles Channel reception Hi-VHF  UHF Size 17.4 x 31.3 x 4 inches Weight 2.7 poundsPBD WA-2608Best yagi antenna for long range viewingPros Cons Includes remote rotation Rotation requires occasional readjustment Lightning protected Supports two TVS without splitter Includes 40-foot coaxial cableYagi-style TV antennas are  generally speaking  great for long range TV broadcasts due to their focused  unidirectional approach. If you live in an area with lots of far-distant broadcasts  however  they can often be a pain as many come meant to be installed in a relatively fixed position and aren’t necessarily easy to rotate at a moment’s notice. That requires much more planning than most are willing to do for their entertainment fix.The humbly-named PBD WA-2608 fixed this issue  however  with its simple remote control that rotates the antenna’s aim at the push of a button. This way you can watch stations to the North of you one hour and to the West the next without breaking a sweat  unlike other unidirectional antennas that might require additional planning or tinkering to do so. There are some reports that you might have to readjust the antenna’s aim periodically  but with practice the control  aiming  and execution of this long range antenna should come easily.We also like that this long range TV antenna will support up to two TVs without requiring you to purchase a splitter. Most yagi users won’t necessarily want to splurge for a splitter  due to the lack of options in different channels that comes with unidirectional antenna control  but having it built-in is a nicety that we always appreciate.Key Specifications Estimated range 150 miles Channel reception VHF  UHF Size 17.5 x 13 x 14.5 inches Weight 6.4 poundsWinegard Amped ProBest indoorPros Cons Ample cable to work with Cable could be excessive Great signal reception Smartphone app makes things simpleWhat if you can’t put your antenna outdoors (such as if you live in an apartment or some rental properties) but still want to sample the world of long range TV antenna broadcasts? Your options will be much more limited. Part of this is because a rooftop will give you the clearest path to those far away broadcast towers  which will be a problem no matter which TV antenna you choose to go with. The other part will be that most TV antennas for the interior of your home will have an effective range closer to 30 or 40 miles. This problem the Winegard Amped Pro avoids handily  being rated up to 60 miles  which is nearly as far as a TV antenna can go.When in use  you’ll want to slap the Winegard Amped Pro on the window that faces the majority of the stations you want to access  then connect it via Bluetooth to the Winegard Connected app. This will give you easy setup options and help you get the best signal possible. You’ll enjoy the Winegard Amped Pro’s Clear Circuit Technology which  as the name suggests  provides for clearer reception.Key Specifications Estimated range 60 miles Channel reception VHF  UHF Size 12 x 13 x 0.6 inches Weight <1 poundGE Outdoor Ultra-ProBest budgetPros Cons Very low cost Somewhat difficult installation Surprisingly durable Lifetime warrantyIt shouldn’t be too much of a surprise that you can get a low-tech TV antenna on the cheap in 2024. And with this model from GE  you can also get one that is able to get long range reception. The GE Outdoor Ultra-Pro can be mounted to your roof or even placed in your attic and gets a an estimated 70 miles of range  the maximum that you can expect to work well in average geographic locations.If you should put it outside  which is definitely recommended for maximum range  you’ll find that the construction of this GE TV antenna is more solid than you might expect for a product of this price. You may  however  discover that it is somewhat difficult to construct due to the small writing on the included instructions. We recommend doing as much as you can before hauling the GE Outdoor Ultra-Pro to your roof or to find a good video tutorial before attempting the process of installing an antenna.Key Specifications Estimated range 70 miles Channel reception VHF  UHF Size 29 x 15 x 20.5 inches Weight 3 poundsHow we chose these long range TV antennasAs previously mentioned  for the best long range TV antennas  we’re looking at TV antennas that are able to pick up a good quality stream from further away than you might typically expect for the form factor. It’s why we feature both indoor and outdoor TV antennas on the list — not everyone can pop a TV antenna on their roof  after all — because there are some indoor TV antennas that can really go the extra mile (or 10 miles  as the case may be).When we zoom in on the issue of getting the best long range TV antennas  however  there is more to the story than just the average range plus 10 miles or so. For an in-depth look at our thinking  as well as what you need to know before you get a TV antenna in 2024  consider the following.How far can a TV antenna reach?Realistically speaking  a TV antenna will not pick up signal over 80 miles away. If you live in a low-lying area  such as in a valley  even 60 miles might be “long range” for you.It’s not a satisfying answer  but a TV antenna’s reach is controlled just as much by the Earth and geography as it is by the power of your antenna. The signal needed to pick up over-the-air broadcasts does not travel through solid materials very well and aren’t known for their capabilities in bouncing off the ozone layer  either. So  if you’re hoping to pick up the TV stations the residents of Osaka are watching from your home in Chicago  you’re entirely out of luck.When manufacturers list estimated ranges for their antennas  the ones that we’ve reported here  you’ll often see ranges beyond 80 miles. If you live in super idealized situations you could theoretically get some of these long distances. The extremely tall Burj Khalifa is so tall that you can see the sunset twice if you travel from the base to the top if you plan everything right. Surely a TV antenna placed on the top of this tower could reach to far off places! But you almost certainly don’t live on the top of Burj Khalifa or Mount Everest’s peak or other idealized places.As a result  cynicism becomes easy. However  focusing on established brands with a track record of providing decent broadcast length of 60+ miles to a variety of customers from diverse locations should alleviate a lot of your concerns. The TV antennas above are selected for a combination of their theoretical range and their actually observed range by real customers like you.Directionality in TV antennasTV antenna reception tends to be more linear in nature than the signal that we receive to fill up our smartphone bars. Still  though  it is quite common to find TV antennas for sale that don’t focus on a single direction. These common antennas have a relatively flat surface and can be generally considered bi-directional. They can generally be faced in just about any direction and are likely to pick up something  as they possess low (if any true) blind spots.Still  you may consider a unidirectional  or ‘Yagi’-style  TV antenna for a more focused “shot” at the broadcasting station you want to tune in to. This can give you a more focused chance at getting good reception  especially on far-distant stations. At the same time  they can be a hassle if you like to tune in to multiple stations that face in largely differing directions as you’ll have to turn the antenna each time you want to switch stations.For convenience  we recommend trying a bi-directional antenna first and switching to a unidirectional yagi-style antenna if you need it. If all of the stations you want are relatively far away or in the same general direction  however  starting with a yagi isn’t a horrible idea. It all depends on your tolerance for tuning.This article is managed and created separately from the Digital Trends Editorial team.Editors' Recommendations,positive,0.9,0.09,0.0,mixed,0.68,0.17,0.14,True,English,"['4 best long range TV antennas', '2024', 'The Antennas Direct ClearStream 4MAX Kit', 'best unidirectional long range TV antenna', 'quality long range TV antenna', 'best long range TV antennas', 'four coil bi-directional design', 'super long range antennas', 'long range TV broadcasts', 'best TV antennas', 'long range viewing', 'Best yagi antenna', 'overall best chance', 'focused, unidirectional approach', 'satellite TV antennas', 'Yagi-style TV antennas', 'other unidirectional antennas', 'attic/outdoor TV antenna', 'indoor TV antennas', 'Simple bracket mounting', 'easy amplification access', 'realistic geographical expectations', 'consistent customer approval', 'remote rotation Rotation', 'new broadcast standard', 'unworldly theoretical extrapolations', '40-foot coaxial cable', '70 miles Channel reception', 'simple remote control', 'compatible 3-way splitter', 'unidirectional support', '4K TV', 'indoor antenna', 'longest range', 'good range', 'rooftop antenna', 'expensive kit', 'reliable kit', 'theoretical distances', 'coax cable', 'other essentials', 'compatible manner', 'distant broadcasts', 'surprising, way', 'great programming', 'large part', 'archaic tech', 'broadcast stations', 'form factor', 'rural areas', 'quick listing', 'lengthy analysis', '70-80 miles', 'perfect situations', 'Pros Cons', 'amplifier switch', 'untoward effort', 'clear streams', 'entire household', 'real estate', 'high mountains', 'upfront policy', 'end result', 'same time', 'Key Specifications', 'UHF Size', 'Weight 2.7 pounds', 'occasional readjustment', 'two TVS', 'fixed position', 'entertainment fix', 'complete set', 'extensive guide', 'additional planning', 'advent', 'ATSC', 'air', 'ton', 'country', 'nearby', 'solution', 'reasoning', 'everyone', 'outliers', 'short', 'strengths', 'weaknesses', 'Note', 'shape', 'Earth', 'ranges', 'manufacturer', 'home', 'setup', 'usage', 'fixings', 'technology', 'ability', 'limitations', 'combination', 'completeness', 'honesty', 'product', 'charts', 'everything', 'others', 'switchers', '4 inches', 'PBD', 'Lightning', 'lots', 'pain', 'moment', 'notice', 'issue', 'aim', 'push', 'North', 'West', 'sweat', 'reports', 'practice', 'execution', 'requ']",2024-03-25,2024-03-26,digitaltrends.com

A long-awaited milestone for the Company and its flagship product has now been reached Cystinuria  a hereditary kidney disorder  is a major unmet medical need  affecting some 30 000 patients in the U.S. The Company is now looking forward to signing a partnership to pursue the development and prepare the marketing of ADV7103 in the U.S in its two indications: cystinuria and dRTA.Regulatory News:Advicenne (Euronext Growth Paris ALDVI - FR0013296746)  a specialty pharmaceutical company dedicated to the development and commercialization of innovative treatments for those suffering from rare renal diseases  today announced that its proprietary drug ADV7103 has been granted Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) status for the treatment of cystinuria. This designation was issued by the US Food and Drug Administration (US FDA). ADV7103 is one of the few drugs to obtain orphan designation in the USA for both indications  cystinuria and distal Renal Tubular Acidosis (dRTA).Didier Laurens  Chief Executive Officer of Advicenne  declared: “After receiving an initial orphan designation of ADV7103 in dRTA in 2022  we are absolutely delighted to announce today that we have obtained orphan drug status in cystinuria. After months of intense discussions with the FDA  this is fantastic news for Advicenne and a major element of value creation. I am very proud of the teams who worked hard for this success  especially in the USA. I am also very proud that the first clinical data obtained in France have convinced the FDA of the benefit of ADV7103 in the treatment of cystinuria. The treatment of this condition with simplified alkalinization is a major unmet medical need with a very significant market potential with more than 30 000 patients in the USA. Obtaining this ODD in cystinuria is the powerful lever we have been waiting for to accelerate and finalize discussions with potential partners in the United States”.Cystinuria is a genetic disease characterized by a buildup of the amino acid cystine in the kidneys and bladder. These high levels of cystine lead to the formation of cystine stones in the kidneys  ureter  and bladder. These stones generate various complications  such as hypertension  intense abdominal pain  recurrent urinary tract infections  renal function impairment in up to 70% of patients and chronic renal insufficiency. These complications can ultimately lead to chronic renal failure.To date  40 000 patients suffer from cystinuria in Europe and around 30 000 in the USA. The treatment of this pathology is based primarily on the alkalinization of urine combined with significant fluid intake and a low-protein diet to limit the recurring formation of kidney stones. ADV7103  an innovative and proprietary fixed combination of sustained-release potassium citrate and potassium bicarbonate  has the potential to become the first major drug in the treatment of cystinuria in North America  as well as in Europe  where ADV7103 is also designated an orphan drug since December 2022.ABOUT ADVICENNEAdvicenne (Euronext: ALDVI) is a specialty pharmaceutical company founded in 2007  specializing in the development of innovative treatments in Nephrology.

The hotels across our global network have embraced this commitment  implementing innovative strategies such as creative menu coordination  habit changing and technology-driven measurement.Tackling Food Waste Head OnAccor has been a pioneer in bringing sustainability to hospitality for more than 30 years  and as a leading player in the industry  the Group recognizes the pressing issue of food waste – which accounted for 53% of the total operational waste of the hotels across our network in 2023. Since 2015  we've been actively engaged in reducing food waste and have integrated this priority into our sustainability strategy. We understand that reducing food waste not only enhances our environmental performance but also strengthens our financial performance as well. In 2023  we deployed a robust methodology  in line with our objective to reduce food waste by 60% by 2030. To achieve this  we've developed guidelines  operational guides and e-learning modules to foster awareness and understanding of measurement methods throughout the teams around the world. We're now working on a third module focused specifically on reduction  ensuring our efforts continue to make a meaningful impact.Discover how hotel teams drive significant change within both their properties and local communities  through 'Stories of Change' that shine a spotlight on the Heartists® on the field.Explore three hotels where impactful change is taking root— Source: AccorPullman Jiaxing Pinghu Excellence: Measuring Food Waste in ChinaWith three restaurants  a 1 500 m² Grand Ballroom and various meeting spaces  the Pullman Jiaxing Pinghu Excellence offers guests diverse food experiences. Managing food waste for more than 238 000 covers annually  however  presents significant challenges. The local team has identified key steps to take  including verifying headcounts before every event  providing to-go boxes so clients can enjoy their leftovers at home and implementing rigorous measurement plans. Initial data review has guided improvement efforts toward their 20% reduction goal by mid-2024. With full leadership engagement  including owner support and team training  they are well on their way towards Accor’s 60% reduction commitment by 2030.— Source: AccorNovotel Abu Dhabi Gate: Changing Habits in the UAEOver the past five years  the kitchen teams at Novotel Abu Dhabi Gate have been diligently monitoring food waste manually. In 2023  they transitioned to a tech-based measurement tool  Orbisk  for enhanced accuracy and monitoring. The hotel has intensified efforts to reduce waste and successful actions include monthly food waste update emails sent to all teams  portion control and removing unpopular items from menus and buffets  displaying daily food waste counts to raise guest awareness  training new Heartists® on best practices and behaviors  and initiating “No Bin Day” in the team cafeteria. So far  the hotel has reduced food waste by 44%  getting them a step closer to the Group’s collective goal by 2030.— Source: AccorFairmont The Queen Elizabeth Hotel: Getting Creative in the Kitchen in CanadaThe kitchens at the Fairmont The Queen Elizabeth Hotel  which serve more than 880 000 covers a year  have infused creativity into their food waste reduction initiatives. For starters  chefs across the property’s seven food and beverage outlets collaborate to synchronize menu items  utilizing the same produce across restaurants but preparing them differently  effectively minimizing waste. Besides adding a creative spin on menu rotation and specials to minimize waste  other initiatives include the use of a food processor  Solucycle  that transforms food waste into Biogas. Through collaborations with local organizations  the hotel sends leftover food to local populations in need  showcasing their commitment to sustainability and community engagement. With these initiatives in place  the hotel has lowered its food waste baseline to 122.5 g per cover ౼ compared to a 300g average across our hotels.About Accor  a world-leading hospitality groupAccor is a world leading hospitality group consisting of more than 5 300 properties and 10 000 food and beverage venues throughout 110 countries.

Adoption of indemnification schemeA statement on indemnification of Board and management members in Danish limited liability companies has been issued by the Danish Business Authority on 13 April 2023. Based on the company's review  the Board of Directors proposes that the annual general meeting adopts a scheme for indemnification of the members of the Board and Directors on the following terms and conditions (the ""Scheme""):Basis and purpose - Whereas it is the company's policy to take out appropriate and customary directors' and officers' liability insurance for members of the Board and Directors  experience shows that it is necessary to offer additional coverage for potential D&O liability in order to attract and retain qualified members of the Board and Directors  particularly individuals accustomed to common law liability regimes  in consideration of the business and the risks associated with the position as member of the Board of Directors of Better Collective. Furthermore  the Company's operations comprise certain activities  which may imply special responsibilities and increased risk exposure for the members of the Board and Directors  particularly in certain foreign jurisdictions. Accordingly  it is considered in the best interest of Better Collective and its shareholders that members of the Board and Directors are offered indemnification against claims raised by third parties supplemental to the Company's D&O liability insurance as further outlined below.It has been duly considered if the Scheme would imply adverse effects for the Company and its shareholders  including if the Scheme would result in excessive and/or hazardous risk-taking behaviour by the members of the Board and Directors and/or if the Scheme would be redundant if Better Collective increased the coverage under the D&O liability insurance. Better Collective has assessed that such alternative increase of the D&O liability insurance coverage would not be commercially viable  and thus not in the interest of the Company and its shareholders. Furthermore  the Scheme is deemed not to encourage members of the Board and Directors to act differently than if the D&O liability insurance coverage would be increased.Covered individuals - The Scheme shall be for the sole benefit of the current and future members of the Board of Directors of the Company. No third party shall be entitled to rely on or derive any benefits from the Scheme or have any recourse against the company on account of the Scheme.Scope - Under the Scheme  the Company shall indemnify and hold harmless a member of the Board and Directors  to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law  from and against any losses incurred by such member of the Board and Directors arising out of any actual or potential claims  including any costs  expenses and potential tax liabilities associated therewith  raised by any third party (other than Better Collective group companies) against a member of the Board and Directors based on such member of the Board and Directors discharge of his/her duties as member of the Board and Directors.Indemnification of members of the Board and Directors under the Scheme is not conditioned on coverage under the D&O liability insurance and shall be secondary to coverage under the D&O liability insurance  as applicable from time to time  and other indemnification sources  if any  i.e.  Better Collective shall not provide indemnification under the Scheme before coverage under the D&O liability insurance and indemnification available from any other source are exhausted. Accordingly  the Scheme may provide coverage for losses which are not covered wholly or partly under the D&O liability insurance  as applicable from time to time. Such secondary coverage does not imply an obligation on Better Collective to exhaust any and all opportunities to relief members of the Board and Directors from liability and does not prevent Better Collective from covering members of the Board and Directors legal defence costs related to potential liability based on a member of the Board and Directors discharge of his/her duties as member of the Board and Directors.Covered conduct - Under the Scheme  indemnification shall apply to any losses incurred by a member of the Board and Directors arising out of and/or based on such member of the Board and Directors discharge of his/her duties as member of the Board of Directors of Better Collective. Any and all losses relating to liability incurred by a member of the Board and Directors arising out of such member of the Board and Directors fraud  sanctioned offences under applicable criminal law or deliberate criminal acts  improper acts and omissions (in Danish ""utilbørlige dispositioner"")  wilful misconduct or  to the extent not indemnifiable under Danish law  gross negligence are excluded from indemnification under the Scheme.Term and covered claims - The Scheme shall apply until amended or revoked by the general meeting of Better Collective. Subject to the Scheme's terms and conditions  this Scheme covers claims made against a member of the Board and Directors arising out of or originates from facts or circumstances prior to the expiry of the term of the Scheme. Claims for indemnification must be notified in writing by a member of the Board and Directors to Better Collective as soon as reasonably possible after the member of the Board and Directors receipt of the claim and no later than 10 years after the expiry of the Scheme's term.Implementation  administration and authority - For the purpose of implementing the Scheme  the Board of Directors shall stipulate the procedural and administrative provisions and other necessary regulations governing the Scheme. In order to eliminate potential conflicts of interests  the Scheme shall be administered by one or more individuals considered independent from the Board of Directors in respect of the Scheme. Furthermore  indemnification of a member of the Board and Directors loss under the Scheme shall always be subject to a legal opinion from a reputable law firm setting out that the claim concerned is covered by the Scheme. Better Collective's obligation to indemnify members of the Board and Directors under the Scheme shall be capped at a market consistent level in due consideration of the activities and risk profile of Better Collective. All claims for indemnification  including if the conduct of a member of the Board and Directors is covered by the Scheme  shall be processed and decided in accordance with Danish law. For the purpose of establishing an indemnification scheme for the Executive Board  the Board of Directors stipulates the terms and conditions applicable to such indemnification scheme within the framework of the Scheme applicable to the Board of Directors.Amendment of the articles of association as a consequence of the indemnification schemeTo provide transparency in respect of the proposed indemnification scheme  the Board of Directors proposes to the general meeting that the following wording is included as a new article 15 in the Company's articles of association:""The Company has established an indemnification scheme for members of the board of directors. Under the indemnification scheme  the Company shall indemnify members of the board of directors from and against any losses incurred by members of the board of directors arising out of any claims raised by any third party (other than Better Collective group companies) based on such members of the board of directors' discharge of their duties as members of the board of directors. Any losses relating to liability incurred by a member of the board of directors arising out of such member's fraud  sanctioned offences under applicable criminal law or deliberate criminal acts  improper acts and omissions (in Danish ""utilbørlige dispositioner"")  wilful misconduct or  to the extent not indemnifiable under Danish law  gross negligence are excluded from indemnification under the Scheme. Indemnification under the scheme shall be secondary to coverage from other sources of indemnification or coverage of liability and is not conditioned on coverage under the directors' and officers' liability insurance  as applicable from time to time. Accordingly  the Company may indemnify for losses which are not covered wholly or partly by the directors' and officers' liability insurance. The board of directors stipulates provisions on the implementation and administration of the indemnification scheme.""Update of the remuneration policy (indemnification scheme)The Board of Directors proposes that the Company's remuneration policy is amended  so that the indemnification scheme applicable to members of the Board of Directors of Better Collective  is included in the remuneration policy.

These final data support DSR’s mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome.Dr. Oliver Gödje  Chief Medical Officer of Sequana Medical  commented: “These final data from the first three patients in the MOJAVE cohort are highly encouraging and together with the positive data from our RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies  indicate the potential for our DSR therapy as a promising treatment for diuretic-resistance and cardiorenal syndrome in heart failure.”Ian Crosbie  Chief Executive Officer of Sequana Medical  added: “We continue to be excited about our DSR program and its potential to transform the treatment of diuretic resistance and and cardiorenal syndrome in heart failure. Unlike loop diuretics which  on average  have a negative impact on renal function and diuretic response  DSR has again demonstrated its potential to restore renal health and control of volume status. We look forward to starting the randomized controlled cohort in the MOJAVE study and are confident that data from the study will deliver a robust clinical package enabling a strategic partnership in this large and growing global market.”Final data from non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE study – confirming previously reported strong data iAll three patients treated in the non-randomized cohort of the MOJAVE study had heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and severe diuretic resistance at baseline (mean furosemide equivalent dose of 1 227 mg per day). At the start of the study treatment period  loop diuretics were withheld  and patients were treated with DSR 2.0 up to daily for four weeks  followed by a three-month safety follow-up period. All three patients successfully completed the three-month safety follow-up period.Dramatic improvement in diuretic response and stable kidney function: During the four-week DSR treatment period  all three patients maintained euvolemia without the need of loop diuretics. After the four-week DSR treatment period  patients’ diuretic responseii nearly normalized with a mean increase of 324% in their six-hour urinary sodium excretion vs baseline  and this was maintained at three months after the last DSR treatment. Throughout the study  patients’ kidney function also remained stable as measured by eGFR and blood urea nitrogen.Loop diuretics virtually eliminated: The need for loop diuretics was dramatically reduced or even completely eliminated  with a reduction in furosemide equivalent dose of 97%  100% and 95% vs baseline at three months after the last DSR treatment.Safe and well tolerated: No clinically relevant changes in serum sodium levels or progressive hyponatremia were observed and none of the patients needed to be hospitalized for congestion throughout the study. There were only two serious adverse events  one short-term hypertension and one non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction  both adjudicated as non-related to DSR therapy. These events occurred during the three-month safety follow-up period and are often seen in this very sick patient population.Start of randomized cohort of MOJAVE study – appoved by Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)In January 2024  the independent DSMB approved the start of the randomized MOJAVE cohort following review of the safety data reported from the non-randomized cohort. The randomized controlled cohort will enrol up to 30 additional patients across different centers in the US  with up to 20 patients treated with DSR 2.0 on top of optimized usual care for congestive heart failure for up to four weeks  and up to ten control patients treated with intravenous loop diuretics as part of maximized usual care for congestive heart failure. After the last DSR treatment  patients will be followed for a three-month safety follow-up period. The Company plans to start the randomized phase after receiving US market approval of its alfapump  anticipated by the end of Q3 2024.For more information  please contact:Sequana MedicalLies VannesteDirector Investor RelationsE: IR@sequanamedical.comT: +32 (0)498 053579About DSR  a disease-modifying heart failure drug therapy tackling cardiorenal syndrome (CRS)Cardiorenal syndrome is a key clinical challenge in heart failure and results from the combined vicious cycle of dysfunction of the heart and kidney. Despite the complex pathophysiology  the resultant clinical profile is thought to manifest as a self-reinforcing negative feedback cycle characterized by decreased glomerular filtration  increased renal sodium avidity  and congestion  despite escalating diuretic doses.No current therapies have been shown to improve patient outcomes in this complex and poorly understood indication. Reducing congestion is a key element of therapy but loop diuretics exacerbate many of the core mechanisms thought to underly CRS. Through effective control of the volume status for an extended period of time and thereby avoiding the negative consequences of loop diuretics  DSR has the potential to break this negative feedback cycle.Extensive analysis of patients in the RED DESERT and SAHARA studies shows the benefit from DSR therapy on i) volume status  ii) normalized diuretic response and dramatically reduced loop diuretic dosing  iii) improvement in kidney function  iv) neurohormonal status and signalling  as well as v) cardiovascular parameters. In these patients there were no congestion-related re-hospitalizations  a one class improvement in their NYHA status and a reduction of 75% in their predicated one-year mortality (based on the Seattle Heart Failure model). Initial data from the non-randomized cohort in the US MOJAVE study support these findings and indicated that DSR is safe and well tolerated  restores diuretic response  virtually eliminates the need for loop diuretics post-DSR therapy and improves cardio-renal health.About Sequana MedicalSequana Medical NV is a pioneer in treating fluid overload  a serious and frequent clinical complication in patients with liver disease  heart failure and cancer. This causes major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care  they become ineffective  untolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing ""diuretic-resistant"" patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  delivering major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients and reducing costs for healthcare systems.The Company's Premarket Approval (PMA) application for the alfapump was submitted to the US FDA in December 2023 and accepted for substantive review in January 2024  having reported positive primary and secondary endpoint data from the North American pivotal POSEIDON study in recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis. US market approval of the alfapump is anticipated by the end of Q3 2024.Results of the Company's RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure support DSR's mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE  a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study  have been successfully treated with DSR  confirming the strong clinical outcomes seen in the RED DESERT and SAHARA studies. The independent Data Safety Monitoring Board approved the start of the randomized MOJAVE cohort of up to a further 30 patients  which is planned after alfapump US PMA approval.Sequana Medical is listed on Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent  Belgium.

Until 27 April 2028  the board of directors is authorised to increase the company's share capital at one or more times by up to a nominal amount of DKK 500 000 000. The increase may be implemented by way of full cash contribution  by conversion of debt or by contribution of other assets than cash  including by way of contribution of an existing business. The capital must be increased with pre-emption rights for existing shareholders. The new shares must be negotiable instruments and will be registered in the name of the holder in the company's register of shareholders; see article 3.2 of these articles of association. The right to dividends and other rights in the company of the new shares will take effect from the date determined by the board of directors  but no later than from the first financial year after the year in which the capital increase was registered.""Item 9.B – Combination and increase of the two separate authorizations to issue new shares without pre-emption rights for the existing shareholders (article 4.1.B and 4.1.C of the articles of association) including a standard one-year extensionThe board of directors proposes that the two separate authorizations under article 4.1.B and 4.1.C be combined into one single authorization  as both articles authorize the Company's board of directors to issue new shares without pre-emption rights for the Company's existing shareholders on similar terms.Currently  up to a nominal value of DKK 122 652 375 new shares may be issued without pre-emption rights pursuant to article 4.1.B  and up to a nominal value of DKK 48 172 800 new shares may be issued without pre-emption rights pursuant to article 4.1.C  and at least at market price for both authorizations.In order to make the articles and total authorizations clearer  it is therefore proposed to combine and increase the two authorizations into a single authorization to issue up to a nominal amount of DKK 500 000 000. In connection herewith  the board of directors also proposes to delete the wording on ""contribution in kind of Reponex Pharmaceutical shares"" stated in the current article 4.1.B  as this transaction was finalized in March 2023.Finally  as part of the proposal  it is proposed that the new authorization is given a standard one-year extension until 31 August 2025.Consequently  it is proposed that article 4.1.C will be removed from the articles of association  and article 4.1.B will have the following complete wording:""4.1.B. Until 31 August 2025  the board of directors is authorised to increase the company's share capital at one or more times by up to a nominal amount of 500 000 000 shares of DKK 1 each. The increase may be implemented by way of full cash contribution  by conversion of debt and/or by contribution of other assets than cash  including by way of contribution of an existing business. The capital must be increased without pre-emption rights for existing shareholders and at least at market price. The new shares must be negotiable instruments.

The new shares must be registered in the name of the holder in the company's register of shareholders; see article 3.2 of these articles of association. The right to dividends and other rights in the company of the new shares will take effect from the date determined by the board of directors at subscription  but no later than from the first financial year after the year in which the capital increase was registered.""Item 9.C – Extension of the authorization to issue warrants (article 4.2 of the articles of association)The board of directors proposes that the authorization to issue warrants pursuant to article 4.2 of the articles of association is given a standard one-year extension.

Until 31 August 2025  the board of directors is authorised to allow the company to issue warrants at one or more times. The warrants must not grant the right to subscribe for shares in the company of a nominal value exceeding DKK 50 000 000. The warrants must be issued without pre-emption rights for existing shareholders and on an arm's length basis; however  the board of directors is entitled to issue shares in the company at a favourable price with respect to shares of a nominal value of DKK 5 000 000. At the same time  the board of directors is authorised to implement capital increases in the company at one or more times in connection with any future exercise of the above warrants. The capital must be increased without pre-emption rights for the company's existing shareholders. The new shares must be negotiable instruments and will be registered in the name of the holder in the company's register of shareholders; see article 3.2 of these articles of association. The board of directors determines the subscription price in connection with the issue of the warrants. The subscription price must never fall below the market price at the date of issue; however  the board of directors is entitled to issue shares in the company at a favourable price with respect to shares of a nominal value of DKK 5 000 000. The new shares must be fully paid up. The right to dividends and other rights in the company of the new shares will take effect from the date determined by the board of directors  but no later than from the first financial year after the year in which the capital increase was registered.""Item 9.D – Increase of the authorization to issue convertible loan notes (article 4.3.A)Pursuant to the current article 4.3.A of the articles of association  the board of directors is authorized to issue convertible loan notes with a right to convert the loan amount to new shares of a nominal amount of up to originally DKK 50 000 000 of which DKK 26 094 503 remains of the current authorization  and without pre-emption rights for the existing shareholders.The board of directors proposes that the authorization is increased from the original nominal amount of up to DKK 50 000 000 with a nominal amount of DKK 473 905 497 to a total nominal amount of up to DKK 523 905 497 of which a nominal amount of DKK 500 000 000 remains of the authorisation. No other changes to the authorization are proposed.Consequently  it is proposed that article 4.3.A  first paragraph  will have the following complete wording:""4.3.A Until 31 August 2026  the board of directors is authorised to allow the company to raise loans at one or more times against bonds or other debt instruments granting the lender the right to convert its debt into shares in the company (convertible loans). The convertible loans must not grant the right to subscribe for shares in the company of a nominal value exceeding DKK 523 905 497. The convertible loans must be raised without pre-emption rights for the company's existing shareholders and on an arm's length basis; however  the board of directors is entitled to issue shares in the company at a favourable price with respect to shares of a nominal value of DKK 4 150 000. At the same time  the board of directors is authorised to implement a capital increase in the company at one or more times in connection with any future conversion of the convertible loans. The capital must be increased without pre-emption rights for the company's existing shareholders. The new shares must be negotiable instruments. The shares must be registered in the name of the holder in the company's register of shareholders; see article 3.2 of these articles of association. The board of directors determines the subscription price in connection with the issue of the convertible loans. The subscription price must never fall below the market price at the date of issue; however  the board of directors is entitled to issue shares in the company at a favourable price with respect to shares of a nominal value of DKK 4 150 000. The new shares must be fully paid up. The right to dividends and other rights in the company of the new shares will take effect from the date determined by the board of directors  but no later than from the first financial year after the year in which the capital increase was registered.""Item 10 – Authorization to the chair of the general meetingThe board of directors proposes that the general meeting authorizes the chair of the general meeting  with a right of substitution  to file the resolutions adopted with the Danish Business Authority and to make any such amendments as the Danish Business Authority may require in order to register or approve the resolutions adopted.Item 11 - Any other business-oOo-Majority requirementsThe proposals under items 9.A – 9.D requires adoption by at least 2/3 of the votes cast as well as the share capital represented at the general meeting.

BEN-8744 was safe and well tolerated  with no Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) reported in any dose cohorts. Importantly  given the liabilities associated with PDE10 inhibitors previously in clinical development for other central nervous system (CNS) indications  there was no evidence of CNS-associated adverse eventsThe pharmacokinetic profile of BEN-8744 generated in the study suggested that twice daily dosing should achieve the desired PDE10 target coverage to elicit a potential therapeutic effect in subsequent clinical studies in UC patientsPDE10 was identified using the Benevolent PlatformTM as a novel drug target for the treatment of UC with potential for meaningful differentiation versus existing standard-of-care treatmentsBenevolentAI  using the Benevolent PlatformTM  identified PDE10 inhibition as a potential novel approach to treat UC  but was aware of CNS side effects with PDE10 inhibitors in development for CNS indications that limited their further clinical development. As a result  BenevolentAI’s scientists designed BEN-8744 to be not only a potent PDE10 inhibitor  but also a peripherally-restricted molecule  i.e. with very limited CNS penetration  to minimise the chances of these side effects occurring. The Phase Ia study results support this profile  showing no evidence of CNS-associated adverse events at any dose level. It is anticipated that the full results from this study will be presented in a peer-reviewed forum at a later date. Phase II-enabling extended regulatory toxicology studies and biomarker qualification studies are underway to permit the extended dosing envisaged for further drug development.Dr. Anne Phelan  Chief Scientific Officer of BenevolentAI  said: “The safety and tolerability profile of BEN-8744 emerging from this Phase Ia study in healthy volunteers is very encouraging with respect to this novel drug candidate’s future development as a differentiated treatment for UC. This is a disease where there remains a notable unmet patient need  as rates of sustained remission remain disappointingly low and there is significant potential for a drug with meaningful differentiation from existing immunosuppressive standard-of-care treatments.”Dr. Joerg Moeller  Chief Executive Officer of BenevolentAI  said: “We are pleased to report the topline data from this first in human study of BEN-8744 in healthy volunteers  which are in line with our ambition to have a molecule with the potential to be devoid of the adverse safety profile that has plagued previous members of this class of agents. As we work up the full results from the Phase Ia trial and finish the required Phase II-enabling preclinical studies for more extended dosing  we will continue to evaluate our options for the further development of this drug candidate.”The Benevolent Platform™ and PDE10 inhibition as a potential novel therapeutic approach to the treatment of UCThe Benevolent PlatformTM has been developed to rapidly identify novel potential drug targets for further evaluation. In the case of this programme  there was no previously published data in all available biomedical literature establishing PDE10 in the disease pathology of UC. Having validated the target hypothesis ex-vivo  BenevolentAI’s scientists were then able to quickly design a lead molecule that  after rapid lead optimisation  resulted in BEN-8744. BEN-8744 was then nominated as a development candidate in September 2021  only two years from programme initiation. As such  BEN-8744  like all programmes within the BenevolentAI pipeline  is a wholly-owned asset of the Company.PDE10 is a dual phosphodiesterase that can function to reduce intracellular levels of both the signalling molecules cAMP and cGMP. Restoration of cAMP and cGMP levels by PDE10 inhibition is anticipated to have a direct anti-inflammatory and potential disease-modifying benefit through improvement of barrier integrity. The therapeutic potential of PDE10 inhibition has been well studied in the central nervous system as its highest level of expression is in the brain. However  clinical trials for PDE10 inhibitors have revealed substantial side effects  thought to be attributable to PDE10 inhibition in the brain. BEN-8744 has been intentionally designed to be peripherally restricted to avoid the CNS side effects and more selectively target PDE10 expression in the periphery. Initial signs of the potential pharmacological efficacy of BEN-8744 were observed in ex-vivo patient-derived colonic biopsies  where treatment with BEN-8744 was shown to reduce the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL6  IL8 and TNFa  in a dose dependent manner. The magnitude of the response was comparable to standard of care agents such as JAK inhibitors and steroids.With a differentiated mechanism of action and potentially disease modifying efficacy  BEN-8744 could also be investigated further in wider inflammatory bowel disease indications  with the Company already having preclinical data indicative of a robust anti-inflammatory response in ex-vivo Crohn’s patient biopsies  allowing for the possibility of indication expansion.About Phase Ia clinical study of BEN-8744 in healthy volunteersThe Phase Ia study of BEN-8744 was a randomised  double-blind  placebo-controlled single centre  single and multiple ascending dose (SAD/MAD) study in healthy volunteers (clinical trial number NCT06118385). The primary objective of the study was to investigate the safety and tolerability of multiple doses and the effect of food on pharmacokinetic profile of BEN-8744 in healthy volunteers  aged 18-65 years. In the MAD study  subjects were dosed twice daily for 14 consecutive days. BEN-8744 or placebo was administered to 8 healthy subjects (BEN-8744 n=6; placebo n=2) in both the single and multiple dose cohorts. In total 6 SAD and 2 MAD cohorts were completed. A total of 54 subjects were exposed to BEN-8744; 36 in the SAD  12 in the MAD and 6 in the food effect study.Public disclosure of inside information in accordance with article 17(1) of the Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 on market abuse (Market Abuse Regulation)About inflammatory bowel diseases – ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s diseaseUlcerative colitis is a chronic  lifelong disease that causes inflammation and ulceration of the inner lining of the colon and rectum.

(NASDAQ: LNZA) were selected by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Clean Energy D......,HOUSTON  March 25  2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Today  Technip Energies and LanzaTech Global  Inc. (NASDAQ: LNZA) were selected by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations to begin award negotiations for up to $200 million in Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) funding as part of the Industrial Demonstrations Program (IDP).The project SECURE – standing for Sustainable Ethylene from CO 2 Utilization with Renewable Energy – aims to develop a transformational technology to produce sustainable ethylene from captured carbon dioxide (CO 2 ). Technip Energies and LanzaTech announced their Joint Collaboration Agreement to create this new pathway to sustainable ethylene at commercial scale in July 2023.Estimated to reach a $200 billion market by 2030 and with a global demand of over 231 million tons per year  ethylene is the key building block for thousands of chemicals and materials and is often called the “world’s most important chemical”. This new joint technology will be developed in the U.S. for integration directly into existing commercial ethylene crackers  whereby it will capture CO 2 emissions from the process and convert them into sustainable ethylene.Arnaud Pieton  CEO at Technip Energies  stated: “We are extremely proud to have been selected by the DOE for this significant award consideration. Together with LanzaTech  our plan is to fully test and develop this breakthrough technology  at scale  in an actual plant  which can then be replicated in other facilities. Carbon utilization and the ability to decarbonize ethylene will have a significant impact on the chemicals industry’s emissions abatement  which is a benefit to us all.”Dr. Jennifer Holmgren  CEO of LanzaTech  said: “The DOE’s Industrial Demonstrations Program is climate leadership in action. We look forward to developing a replicable  breakthrough solution with Technip Energies that creates high-quality jobs and supports local communities for a just energy transition.”U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm said: “Spurring on the next generation of decarbonization technologies in key industries like steel  paper  concrete  and glass will keep America the most competitive nation on Earth. Thanks to President Biden’s industrial strategy  DOE is making the largest investment in industrial decarbonization in the history of the United States. These investments will slash emissions from these difficult-to-decarbonize sectors and ensure American businesses and American workers remain at the forefront of the global economy.”If awarded  up to $200 million is expected to fund the design  engineering  construction  and equipment for a commercial-scale integrated technology unit in the U.S. Leveraging Technip Energies’ substantial industry expertise  this integrated solution has significant replication potential for ethylene crackers worldwide. Globally  there are an estimated 370 ethylene steam crackers  over 40% of which use Technip Energies’ technology  including 8 in the US.Project SECURE expects to provide 200 construction jobs and 40 permanent jobs with benefits and training opportunities. Once the site is finalized  the project aims to hire from the local area with a focus on residents of disadvantaged communities. Technip Energies and LanzaTech plan to approach community groups  unions  and labor groups to negotiate  review  and update agreements for quality jobs and community collaboration at the host site. The project was selected as one of 33 projects across more than 20 states to receive up to a total of $6 billion to demonstrate commercial-scale decarbonization solutions needed to move energy-intensive industries toward net-zero while strengthening local economies  creating  and maintaining high-quality jobs  and slashing harmful emissions that jeopardize public health.Learn more about IDP and projects selected for award negotiations here.About Technip EnergiesTechnip Energies is a leading Engineering & Technology company for the energy transition  with leadership positions in LNG  hydrogen and ethylene as well as growing market positions in blue and green hydrogen  sustainable chemistry and CO2 management.

Basis of presentation of the Financial Statements 2.1 Financial reporting regulatory framework applicable to the Company These annual accounts have been prepared by the members of the board of directors in accordance with the regulatory financial reporting framework applicable to the Company  which is that set out in: a) Code of Commerce and other mercantile legislation.b) General Accounting Plan approved by R.D. 1514/2007 and the amendments incorporated therein by RD 1159/2010 and RD 602/2016 and the sectoral adaptation to real estate companies. NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS ARIMELIA ITG SOCIMI  S.A. (Sociedad Unipersonal) FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2021 (expressed in euros) c) The mandatory rules approved by the Instituto de Contabilidad y Auditoría de Cuentas (Accounting and Auditing Institute) in development of the General Accounting Plan and its complementary rules.d) Law 11/2009  of 26 October  as amended by Law 16/2012 of 27 December  which regulates Listed Real Estate Investment Companies (SOCIMIs).e) All other applicable Spanish accounting legislation. 2.2. True and fair view: The annual accounts have been prepared on the basis of the accounting records and the legal provisions in force have been applied in order to give a true and fair view of the Company's net worth  financial position and results for the year ended 30 September 2021. 2.3 Accounting principles: It has not been necessary  nor has it been deemed appropriate  for the company's management to apply optional accounting principles other than those required by Article 38 of the Commercial Code and the first part of the general accounting plan for SMEs. 2.4 Critical aspects of the valuation and estimation of uncertainty: In preparing the financial statements for the year  estimates and assumptions were made based on the best information available at the end of the period on the events analysed. It is possible that future events may make it necessary to change them (upwards or downwards) in coming years  which would be done prospectively  recognising the effects of the change in estimates in the corresponding future financial statements. The main estimates made by the Company's Board of Directors are detailed below. a) Valuation of non-current assets The valuation of non-current assets  other than financial assets  requires estimates to be made in order to determine their fair value for the purpose of assessing possible impairment  especially of investment property. In order to determine this fair value  the members of the Board of Directors of the Company carried out an internal analysis as well as commissioned an independent expert to carry out a valuation of the investment property. Both valuations were carried out on the basis of an estimate of the expected future cash flows of these assets and using an appropriate discount rate to calculate the present value of these cash flows. b) Useful lives of investment property Management determines the estimated useful lives and related depreciation charges for investment property. The useful lives of investment property. The useful lives of investment property are estimated in relation to the period over which the items included under this heading will generate economic benefits. The Company reviews the useful lives of investment property at each balance sheet date and  if the estimates differ from those previously made  the effect of the change is accounted for prospectively from the year in which the change is made. c) Income tax The Company is covered by the regime established in Law 11/2009  of 26 October  which regulates Listed Real Estate Investment Companies (SOCIMI)  which in practice means that  subject to compliance with certain requirements  the Company is subject to a corporate income tax rate of 0%. The members of the Company's Board of Directors monitor compliance with the requirements established in the legislation in order to safeguard the tax benefits established therein. In this respect  the directors estimate that these requirements are complied with within the established deadlines and terms  and do not proceed to record any income tax result. NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS ARIMELIA ITG SOCIMI  S.A. (Sociedad Unipersonal) FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2021 (expressed in euros) Although these estimates were prepared on the basis of the best information available at the end of the financial year 2021  future events may cause these estimates to change (upwards or downwards) in the future. Changes in accounting estimates will be applied prospectively. 2.5 Comparison of information: In accordance with company law  the Company submit for comparative purposes  in addition to the figures for the year ended 30 September 2021  the figures for the previous 9-month period from 1 January 2020 to 30 September 2020  whereby the previous year's figures are not comparable. 2.6 Items collected under several headings Certain items in the balance sheet and income statement are grouped together for ease of understanding  although  to the extent material  the information is disclosed in the relevant notes to the consolidated financial statements.. 2.7 Changes in accounting policies No other changes were made in the accounting criteria during the year ended 30 September 2021. 2.8 Operating company At 30 September 2021 and 30 September 2020  the company has negative working capital of €539 549.43 and €1 515 089.84  respectively  mainly as a result of the amount of interest payable on the financing received from the sole shareholder and the short-term commitments of the bank financing (financial year 2021) and the deferred payment for the purchase of real estate assets (financial year 2020). The sole shareholder will continue to provide sufficient financial support to meet short-term commitments not covered by rental income. In November 2021  one of the Company's assets was sold  generating sufficient cash to meet short-term commitments. In January 2021  the Company obtained a long-term loan which enabled it to meet its existing payment commitments at 30 September 2020. NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS ARIMELIA ITG SOCIMI  S.A. (Sociedad Unipersonal) FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2021 (expressed in euros) 3. Profit distribution For the year ended 30 September 2021  the Company has made losses amounting to €817 406.11 and the Board of Directors will propose the following distribution to the Sole Shareholder: - A Negative results from previous years in order to offset them against profits from future years. The members of the Board of Directors consider that the proposed allocation of the result will be approved by the Sole Shareholder. On 30 July 2021 the Sole Shareholder approved the annual accounts for the 9 months ended 30 September 2020  determining a loss of EUR 378 858.05 and its distribution to the account of negative results of previous years. Profit distribution rules applicable to SOCIMI. In accordance with current legislation  SOCIMIs that have opted for the special tax regime are obliged to distribute the profit obtained in the year to their shareholders in the form of dividends  once the corresponding commercial obligations have been met  and the distribution must be agreed within six months of the end of each year and paid within one month of the date of the distribution agreement. On the other hand  as indicated in Law 11/2009  of 26 October 2009  amended by Law 16/2012  of 27 December  the Company must distribute as dividends: - 100% of the profits from dividends or shares in profits distributed by the entities referred to in section 1 of article 2 of Law 11/2009.- At least 50% of the profits derived from the transfer of real estate and shares or holdings referred to in section 1 of article 2 of Law 11/2009  made after the periods referred to in section 2 of article 3 of Law 11/2009 have elapsed  used for the fulfilment of its main corporate purpose. The remainder of these profits must be reinvested in other properties or holdings assigned to the fulfilment of said object  within three years from the date of transfer. Otherwise  these profits must be distributed in full together with the profits  if any  arising from the year in which the reinvestment period ends. If the reinvested items are transferred before the holding period  those profits must be distributed in full together with any profits arising in the year in which they are transferred. The obligation to distribute does not extend  where applicable  to the part of these profits attributable to years in which the Company was not taxed under the special tax regime established in the aforementioned Law.- At least 80% of the remainder of the profits obtained. When the distribution of dividends is charged to reserves from profits of a year in which the special tax regime has been applied  the distribution must be made in the manner described above. 4. Registration and valuation rules The main recording and valuation rules used by the Company in the preparation of the annual accounts  in accordance with those established by the Spanish National Chart of Accounts  were as follows: 4.1. Investment property Investment property in the accompanying balance sheet includes the value of land  buildings and other structures held either for rental purposes or to obtain a capital gain on their sale as a result of future increases in their respective market prices. In addition  investment property includes furniture because it is earmarked for investments to be operated on a rental basis. Investment property is initially measured at acquisition cost and subsequently reduced by the related accumulated depreciation and impairment losses  if any  as described in Note 4.2. Upkeep and maintenance expenses of the various items comprising investment property are charged to the income statement for the year in which they are incurred. Conversely  amounts invested in improvements that contribute to increasing the capacity or efficiency or extending the useful life of these assets are recorded as an increase in their cost. NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS ARIMELIA ITG SOCIMI  S.A. (Sociedad Unipersonal) FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2021 (expressed in euros) Depreciation of these items  with the exception of land  which is not depreciated  is provided on a systematic and rational basis over the useful lives of the assets and their residual values  taking into account the depreciation normally suffered through operation  use and enjoyment  without prejudice to the consideration of any technical or commercial obsolescence that may affect them. The estimated useful lives of the various components identified under the investment property caption are as follows. % depreciation Constructions 2% Plants and machinery 5% Furniture and fixtures 10% 4.2. Impairment of investment properties Whenever there are indications of impairment of investment property  the Company uses the so-called ""impairment test"" to estimate the possible existence of impairment losses that reduce the recoverable amount of these assets to an amount lower than their carrying amount. The recoverable amount is determined as the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In particular  for all investment property  the recoverable amount is determined by discounting future cash flows generated by the related asset based on the existing committed rental income and using market discount rates. Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses  the carrying amount of the asset is increased by the revised estimate of its recoverable amount  but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised in prior periods. 4.3. Leases Finance leases Leases are classified as finance leases provided that the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the leased asset to the lessee. Other leases are classified as operating leases. At 30 September 2021 and 30 September 2020  the Company does not hold any finance leases. Operating leases Income and expenses arising from operating lease agreements are charged to the income statement in the year in which they accrue. In addition  the acquisition cost of the leased asset is presented in the balance sheet in accordance with its nature  increased by the amount of directly attributable contract costs  which are recognised as an expense over the term of the contract  applying the same criteria used for the recognition of lease income. Any collections or payments that may be made under an operating lease are treated as prepayments or collections and are taken to profit or loss over the lease term as the benefits of the leased asset are transferred or received.

Financial instruments 4.4.1 Financial assets Classification The financial assets held by the Company are classified into the following categories: (a) Loans and receivables: financial assets arising from the sale of goods or the rendering of services in the ordinary course of the Company's business  or those which  not having a commercial origin  are not equity instruments or derivatives and whose collections are of a fixed or determinable amount and are not traded in an active market. (b) Cash and cash equivalents: cash and cash equivalents comprise both cash and sight deposits. Cash and cash equivalents are short-term investments with maturities of less than three months that are not subject to a significant risk of changes in value. Initial valuation Financial assets are generally recognised initially at the fair value of the consideration given plus directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequent measurement Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost. At least at year-end the Company performs an impairment test for financial assets that are not carried at fair value. Objective evidence of impairment is considered to exist if the recoverable amount of the financial asset is less than its carrying amount. When this occurs  the impairment is recognised in the income statement. The Company derecognises financial assets when the rights to the cash flows from the financial asset expire or have been transferred and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred. Conversely  the Company does not derecognise financial assets  and recognises a financial liability for an amount equal to the consideration received  on transfers of financial assets in which substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are retained. 4.4.2 Financial liabilities Financial liabilities are those payables and receivables of the Company arising from the purchase of goods and services in the ordinary course of the Company's business  or those which  without having a commercial origin  cannot be considered to be derivative financial instruments. Payables and payables are initially measured at the fair value of the consideration received  adjusted for directly attributable transaction costs. Subsequently  such liabilities are measured at amortised cost. The Company derecognises financial liabilities when the obligations giving rise to them are extinguished. 4.5. Equity Share capital is represented by ordinary shares. The costs of issuing new shares or options are presented directly against equity  as a reduction in reserves. In the case of the acquisition of the Company's own shares  the consideration paid  including any directly attributable incremental costs  is deducted from equity until cancellation  reissue or disposal. When these shares are subsequently sold or reissued  any amount received  net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs  is included in equity. NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS ARIMELIA ITG SOCIMI  S.A. (Sociedad Unipersonal) FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2021 (expressed in euros) 4.6. Income tax SOCIMI regime Pursuant to Law 11/2009  of 26 October  which regulates listed real estate investment companies  entities that meet the requirements defined in the regulations and opt to apply the special tax regime provided for in this Law will be taxed at a 0% corporate income tax rate. In the event that tax losses are generated  article 26 of Law 27/2014  27 November  on Corporate Income Tax will not be applicable. Likewise  the system of deductions and allowances established in Chapters II  III and IV of the aforementioned law shall not apply. In all other matters not provided for in the SOCIMI Law  the provisions of Law 27/2014  on Corporate Income Tax  shall be applicable on a supplementary basis. The entity shall be subject to a special tax of 19% on the full amount of dividends or shares in profits distributed to shareholders whose interest in the share capital of the entity is equal to or greater than 5%  when such dividends are exempt or taxed at a tax rate of less than 10%. This tax will be treated as a corporate income tax liability. On 20 September 2019  the Company opted for the special SOCIMI tax regime  and the tax authorities were notified on 23 September 2019. The Company was listed on a regulated market (Euronext Access) on 16 September 2021  and therefore meets all the requirements for the application of the SOCIMI regime. 4.7. Income and expenses Income and expenses are recognised on an accruals basis  i.e. when the actual flow of the related goods and services occurs  regardless of when the resulting monetary or financial flow arises. Such revenues are measured at the fair value of the consideration received  net of discounts and taxes. The Company provides rental services. Rental income from property leases is recognised on an accruals basis  with incentive income and the initial costs of the lease contracts being allocated on a straight-line basis. The costs related to each lease instalment  including impairment charges  are recognised as an expense. Properties leased to third parties  all of which are held under operating leases  are included in the line ""Investment property"" in the balance sheet. Interest received from financial assets is recognised using the effective interest rate method. In any case  interest on financial assets accrued after the time of acquisition is recognised as income in the profit and loss account. 4.8. Employee benefits Termination benefits Termination benefits are paid to employees as a result of the Company's decision to terminate their employment before the normal retirement age or when the employee voluntarily accepts to resign in exchange for these benefits. The Company recognises these benefits when it has demonstrably undertaken to terminate the employees' employment in accordance with a detailed formal retirement plan or to provide termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy. Benefits that will not be paid within twelve months of the balance sheet date are discounted to their present value. 4.9. Provisions and contingencies In preparing the annual accounts  the members of the Board of Directors of the Company distinguish between: a) Provisions: credit balances covering present obligations arising from past events  the settlement of which is probable to give rise to an outflow of resources  but the amount and/or timing of which is uncertain. b) Contingent liabilities: possible obligations arising from past events  the future realisation of which is conditional on the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more future events beyond the Company's control. NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS ARIMELIA ITG SOCIMI  S.A. (Sociedad Unipersonal) FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 SEPTEMBER 2021 (expressed in euros) The accompanying financial statements include all provisions for which it is considered more likely than not that the obligation will have to be settled. Unless they are considered remote  contingent liabilities are not recognised in the financial statements  but are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Provisions are measured at the present value of the best possible estimate of the amount required to settle or transfer the obligation  taking into account available information about the event and its consequences  with adjustments arising from the discounting of such provisions recognised as a finance cost as accrued. At 30 September 2021 and 2020  the Company has no provisions or contingencies in addition to those already disclosed in these financial statements. 4.10. Environmental assetsAssets of an environmental nature are assets that are used on a lasting basis in the Company's activity  the main purpose of which is to minimise environmental impact and protect and improve the environment  including the reduction or elimination of future pollution. The Company's activity  by its nature  does not have a significant environmental impact. 4.11. Transactions with related parties Transactions with related parties are recorded at market value. 4.12. Current and non-current items Current assets are defined as assets related to the normal operating cycle  which is generally considered to be one year; other assets whose maturity  disposal or realisation is expected to take place in the short term from the year-end date  financial assets held for trading  with the exception of financial derivatives with a settlement period exceeding one year  and cash and cash equivalents. Assets that do not meet these requirements are classified as non-current. Similarly  current liabilities are those linked to the normal operating cycle  financial liabilities held for trading  with the exception of financial derivatives whose settlement period exceeds one year  and  in general  all obligations whose maturity or extinction will occur in the short term. Otherwise  they are classified as non-current. 5. Real estate investments The Company's movable investments correspond to properties that are intended to be operated on a rental basis.

(Euronext Paris: QDT)  a leader in business solutions for meaningful customer connections through digital and physical channels  today announces its 2023 fourth-quarter consolidated sales and full-year results (period ended on 31 January 2024). The full-year 2023 results were approved by the Board of Directors during a meeting held on 22 March 2024.Geoffrey Godet  Chief Executive Officer of Quadient S.A.  stated: “By thoroughly executing our Back to Growth strategic plan over the past five years  we successfully repositioned Quadient as an integrated and innovative B-to-B subscription platform  powering billions of connections every day and meeting a wide range of essential business and communication needs. To deliver our strategic vision  we divested non-core activities and selectively acquired several key assets. This now provides us with the opportunity to leverage our 400 000+ customer base  having developed integrated  fast growing  synergistic  and therefore highly relevant solutions.“More specifically  the second phase of our plan  launched three years ago  was aimed at setting Quadient on a sustainable top line and current EBIT(2) growth trajectory. Today’s results confirm the positive trend followed by Quadient since the low point reached in 2021 and evidenced by the 9.3% organic growth recorded in 2023. In addition  our disciplined capital allocation policy allowed us to bring our leverage down every year  standing at 1.65x in 2023 (i.e.  exceeding the 1.75x target set three years ago) and increase our proposed dividend for the third consecutive year  while also making the necessary acquisitions and investments over the period. Importantly  ESG has remained at the core of Quadient’s organization  with the Group being continuously recognized for its strong ESG credentials. I would like to thank our teams for their unwavering commitment to delivering such strong achievements.“This solid performance coincides with three major successes for our Software activities: a return to operating profitability  the successful transition to a SaaS business model  and the deployment of a cloud platform recognized as an undisputed leader in its field by industry analysts  notably for its use of AI-driven technologies. The improving operating trend is expected to continue  driven by sustained organic growth in subscription-related revenue  thanks  in particular  to significant cross-sales to our existing customer base. Meanwhile  our Mail business has continued to exceed expectations  through growth in product placements  and by maintaining a high level of profitability. Finally  in our Locker Solution  building upon our experience in Japan  we have increased our strategic focus towards scaling open networks. Whilst we are still in the initial investment phase in France and in the UK  the already high operating profit margin for the existing installed base gives us confidence in further improvement in revenue growth and profitability for this activity.“As we are closing this key chapter in the history of the Company  I look forward to sharing the next stage of our journey with you  so please join us on 19 June 2024 for our 2024-2026 Capital Markets Day presentation”.FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE BY SOLUTION AND GEOGRAPHYGroup sales came in at €1 062 million in FY 2023  a 1.9% organic growth compared to FY 2022 and a (0.8)% decrease on a reported basis. Organic growth was in line with the guidance of c.2% revised in November 2023. The reported growth includes a negative currency impact of €25 million and a negative scope effect of €4 million. The change in scope is related to the divestments of the Graphic activities in the Nordics and the Shipping business in France  both sold in June 2022 as well as the acquisition of Daylight in September 2023. The FY 2023 financial statements reflect Quadient’s decision to review the future of its Mail activity in Italy with a view to divest this subsidiary within the next 12 months. Therefore  the P&L contribution of the above-mentioned subsidiary is presented as discontinued operations. The FY 2022 financial statements have been restated for comparison purposes.In the fourth quarter of 2023  consolidated sales stood at €284 million  up 1.4% on an organic basis and down (0.3)% on a reported basis compared to the fourth quarter of 2022.Consolidated sales and current EBIT(2) by SolutionFY 2023 consolidated salesIn € million FY 2023 FY 2022 Change Organic change Intelligent Communication Automation 245 227 +7.9% +9.0% Mail-Related Solutions(a) 729 747 (2.4)% (0.2)% Parcel Locker Solutions(a) 88 91 (3.1)% +1.6% Other solutions divested in 2022 0 5 n/a n/a Group total 1 062 1 071 (0.8)% +1.9% (a) Mail-Related Solutions and Parcel Locker Solutions 2022 data have been restated to reflect the fact that they now include activities previously accounted for in Additional Operations.Current EBIT(b) and current EBIT margin(b) by Solution – FY 2023FY 2023 FY 2022 In € million Current EBIT EBIT margin Current EBIT EBIT margin Intelligent Communication Automation 1 0.3% (10) (4.5)% Mail-Related Solutions(a) 177 24.3% 187 25.0% Parcel Locker Solutions(a) (21) (23.4)% (25) (27.8)% Other solutions divested in 2022 - - (0) (5.3)% Group total 157 14.8% 151 14.1%(a) Mail-Related Solutions and Parcel Locker Solutions 2022 data have been restated to reflect the fact that they now include activities previously accounted for in Additional Operations(b) Before acquisition-related expensesIntelligent Communication AutomationIn FY 2023  sales from Intelligent Communication Automation reached €245 million  up 9.0% organically and up 7.9% on a reported basis compared to FY 2022.Subscription-related revenue recorded a strong 16.8% organic growth  now representing 80% of Intelligent Communication Automation total sales  a significant increase compared to 75% in FY 2022. The successful onboarding of 4 000+ cloud customers on the new Quadient Hub since April 2023 has been a key supportive factor for the upsell of additional modules of the Hub to existing customers. At c.+10% in the FY 2023  usage has increased further. The share of SaaS customers also improved  reaching 82% at the end of FY 2023.The change in business model from on-premise licenses to SaaS and the lower requirements for installation and support services continue to drive the decline in professional services and license sales  which  together  are now representing only 13% and 7% of total revenue  respectively. At the end of FY 2023  annual recurring revenue (ARR)  which is a forward-looking indicator of future subscription-related revenue  reached €206 million  up from €187 million at the end of FY 2022  representing a 12.1% organic(4) growth compared to the end of FY 2022. Organic growth for the year was impacted by the postponement of two large contracts recorded in Q3 2023.Throughout FY 2023  Quadient continued to sign significant partnerships  notably with Altares and Coface  to offer highly accurate company rating and credit analysis for its Accounts Receivable module. Quadient financial automation modules are now also recommended to Sage Intacct customers and partners  with Quadient reaching Sage Tech Partner plus status. In addition  Quadient solutions are now integrated with global small business platform Xero  offering their customers access to Quadient’s Accounts Payable automation capabilities to drive efficiencies.In the course of the year  Quadient Software product offering benefitted from continuous improvements with:The launch of the Quadient HubThe addition of Daylight  acquired in Q3 2023  rebranded Inspire iForms and subsequently relaunched;Enhanced Cash Application module with machine learning and new next-gen payment user interface;On-premise solutions enhanced with private cloud deployment options.Q4 2023 sales were up by 7.2% on an organic basis to €66 million with positive performance from all geographies. The subscription-related revenue showed a strong organic growth at +14.4%. In Q4 2023  Quadient recorded its highest quarter ever for Mail customers cross sold to the Software platform in North America.Current EBIT(2) for Intelligent Communication Automation achieved a significant milestone  by reaching profitability  at €1 million  i.e. a current EBIT margin(2) of 0.3%  up 4.8 points compared to FY 2022. This solid improvement comes as Quadient’s Software Solution has almost completed its transition from on-premise licenses to SaaS. It confirms the upturn in profitability trend seen since the inflexion point in H2 2022  despite continued investments in R&D and product developments. The improving profitability trend is expected to continue in FY 2024 supported by a good level of SaaS bookings.Mail-Related SolutionsMail-Related Solutions sales reached €729 million in FY 2023  down only (0.2)% on an organic basis and down (2.4)% on a reported basis. North America and International recorded strong performances with year-over-year organic growth  while Main European Countries showed a contained decline thanks to improving trends in France/Benelux.Hardware sales recorded a 2.1% organic growth in FY 2023  with a solid performance in Q4  notably a double-digit increase in the United States. The focus on investing into renewing the products offering continues to support solid product placements  as seen in the further increase in the share of the upgraded installed base  reaching 31.5% at the end of FY 2023 vs. 19.9% at the end of FY 2022.Subscription-related revenues (68% of Mail-Related Solution sales) recorded a limited (1.3)% organic decline in FY 2023  thanks to a solid performance throughout the year  supported both by robust rental product placements and the positive impact on recurring revenue of recent good performance in hardware sales. Solid year-over-year increase in bookings throughout FY 2023 reflect the focus on maintaining an efficient go-to-market  drawing in particular on innovative products. The multiple contracts recently won within the US healthcare industry highlight how Quadient Mail-Related Solutions is able to strengthen its position in an attractive industry with critical communications needs.Q4 2023 sales continued to show strong resilience  reaching €196 million in Q4  up by 0.3% on an organic basis. Of note  the strong performance in hardware sales  up 3.4% year-over-year on an organic basis.Current EBIT(2) for Mail-Related Solutions was €177 million for FY 2023. Current EBIT(2) margin reached 24.3%. The level of profitability of Mail-Related Solutions remains high despite investments in sales capabilities. Tight cost control and continued focus on remanufacturing  as well as the increased penetration of the new generation of mail equipment all contributed to this strong performance.Parcel Locker SolutionsParcel Locker Solutions sales reached €88 million in FY 2023  a 1.6% increase on an organic basis and a (3.1)% decrease compared to FY 2022. Quadient’s global locker installed base reached c.20 200 units at the end of FY 2023 vs. c.18 000 units at the end of FY 2022. Over the 2021-2023 period  it represents an 18% average increase per annum.Subscription-related revenues were up 5.3% organically in FY 2023  benefiting from the contribution of the existing installed base and the deployment of existing contracts. Subscription-related revenue stood at 61% of total revenue for Parcel Locker Solutions in FY 2023 and the usage rate of the platform remained solid  standing at 58% in FY 2023.FY 2023 has been a year of transition for Parcel Locker Solutions with two material events: i) an increased focus on open-networks in France and in the UK and ii) the renewal in July 2023 of the joint-venture with Yamato with significant changes brought to the commercial agreement – from a mostly fixed rental model to a fee per parcel model (based on usage consumption) – to maximize volume usage. Consequently  the FY 2023 performance reflects these changes. Based on strong relationships with a significant number of international carriers  the open network strategy is aiming at growing both usage & the installed base through:securing volumes with international carriers (GLS  Evri  UPS  DHL  Yamato Transport…);with international carriers (GLS  Evri  UPS  DHL  Yamato Transport…); prime locations to install parcel lockers.Solid volumes ramp up into the existing open networks and continuous efforts to secure prime locations and accelerate lockers deployment should drive future growth in subscription-related revenue.License and hardware sales were down (7.5)% organically in FY 2023. Hardware sales suffered from high comparison basis due to one off deals in FY 2022. Quadient’s US multifamily business  however  has continued to grow at a steady pace in FY 2023.Q4 2023 sales stood at €22 million in Q4 2023  a (4.8)% organic decline due to a high comparison basis in International with one-off deals in Q4 2022 as well as the impact from the Yamato contract renegotiation.Current EBIT(2) for Parcel Locker Solutions was negative at €(21) million in FY 2023  compared to €(25) million in FY 2022  i.e. an EBIT margin(2) of (23.4)%  improving by 4.4 points compared to FY 2022. The improvement in operating profitability was led by gross margin expansion through efficiency measures and lower freight costs. Profitability is expected to continue improving in 2024. Lastly  profitability of the installed base continues to increase year-over-year  standing at 13.6% in FY 2023 vs. 12.5% in FY 2022.Consolidated sales by geographyFY 2023 consolidated salesIn € million FY 2023 FY 2022 Change Organic change North America 607 599 +1.4% +4.5% Main European countries(a) 354 356 (0.8)% (2.4)% International(b) 101 116 (12.3)% +1.9% Group total 1 062 1 071 (0.8)% +1.9% (a) Including Austria  Benelux  France  Germany  Ireland  Italy (excluding MRS)  Switzerland  and the United Kingdom(b) International includes the activities of Intelligent Communication Automation  Mail-Related Solutions and Parcel Locker Solutions outside of North America and the Main European countries as well as  in Q1 2022  other solutions previously recorded under Additional Operation and divested in Q2 2022Sales in North America (57% of Group sales) were up 4.5% organically and 1.4% on a reported basis to €607 million. All three Solutions posted organic growth in FY 2023. Intelligent Communication Automation was the main contributor to the growth in the region with a solid double-digit organic growth. Penetration of Quadient’s cloud-based solutions continues to be well supported by successful cross-selling from the Mail customer base. Mail-Related Solutions continued to show positive performance  benefiting from the solid penetration of recently launched products meeting the requirements brought by the ongoing USPS decertification. North America posted 4.9% organic growth in the fourth quarter driven by the growth in the three solutions.Main European countries (33% of Group sales) were down by (2.4)% organically and (0.8)% on a reported basis to €354 million  due to a limited decline from Mail-Related Solutions  and despite:The positive contribution from Intelligent Communication Automation with a good penetration of recently launched products  andOrganic growth in Parcel Locker Solutions supported by both the ramp up in volumes in the open networks and the on-going deployment of existing contracts.Main European Countries posted a 1.8% organic decline in Q4 2023  with a contained decline from Mail-Related Solutions and solid organic growth from Intelligent Communication Automation.Finally  the International segment (10% of Group sales) delivered a 1.9% organic growth  to €101 million  thanks to solid performance in Intelligence Communication Automation and Mail-Related Solutions partially compensated by both the impact from the change in contractual agreement with Yamato and the temporary slowdown in the expansion of the Japanese lockers network. International sales declined by (6.7)% organically in Q4 2023.REVIEW OF 2023 FULL-YEAR RESULTSSimplified P&LIn € million 2023 2022 Change Sales 1 062 1 071 (0.8)% Gross profit 788 785 +0.4% Gross margin 74.2% 73.3% EBITDA 244 240 +1.8% EBITDA margin 23.0% 22.4% Current operating income before acquisition-related expenses 157 151 +4.4% Current operating margin (before acquisition related expenses) 14.8% 14.1% Current operating income 147 140 +4.5% Optimization expenses and other operating income & expenses (15) (73) n.m Operating income 132 67 +96.5% Financial income/(expense) (31) (36) n.m Net income of continued operations 84 16 n.m Net income from discontinued operations (14) (0) n.m.

Improvement was mainly driven by supply chain efficiency  cost control measures and positive volume/mix effect.Current operating income before acquisition-related expenses (current EBIT(2)) increased for the third consecutive year on a reported basis  reaching €157 million in FY 2023 compared to €151 million in FY 2022. Current EBIT(2) was up 4.4% on a reported basis and up 9.3% on an organic basis  in line with the c.10% organic growth guidance for the year. Current operating margin before acquisition-related expenses stood at 14.8% of sales in FY 2023 compared to 14.1% in FY 2022. The Group’s improvement in operating profitability was achieved without compromising on R&D spending and despite further investments in go-to-market.Acquisition-related expenses increased slightly to €11 million in FY 2023  compared to €10 million in FY 2022. Consequently  current operating income stood at €147 million in FY 2023  compared to €140 million in FY 2022.Optimization costs and other operating expenses stood at €15 million in FY 2023  versus €73 million in FY 2022 which was impacted by goodwill impairment and corporate office restructuring.Consequently  operating income reached €132 million in FY 2023  versus €67 million recorded in FY 2022.Net attributable incomeNet cost of debt was slightly up year-on-year at €29 million  against €27 million in FY 2022. Higher interest rates on the variable portion of the debt (one third of Quadient’s debt) and the c.€2 million financial gain on the partial €57 million buy back of the 2025 bond over the October 2023 - January 2024 period were the main factors behind the variation. The currency gains & losses and other financial items were a loss of €(1) million in FY 2023 versus a loss of €(4) million in FY 2022. Overall  net financial result was a loss of €31 million in FY 2023 compared to a loss of €36 million in FY 2022.Income tax expense was stable year-over-year at €17 million in FY 2023 and benefitted from a positive impact of internal IP transfer in 2023.The corporate tax rate dropped to 16.6% in FY 2023 compared to 54.8% in FY 2022. FY 2022 level was impacted by the low level of income before tax due to goodwill impairments.Net income from discontinued operations of the Mail Italian subsidiary amounts to €(14) million  level which also includes exceptional charges linked to the sale process for this subsidiary.Net attributable income after minority interest amounted to €69 million in FY 2023 compared to €13 million in FY 2022.Earnings per share from continued operations came in at €2.42 in FY 2023 compared to €0.30 in FY 2022. The fully diluted earnings per share(5) was €2.41.Earnings per share stood at €2.02 in FY 2023 compared to €0.29 in FY 2022. The fully diluted earnings per share(5) was €2.01.Proposed dividend for FY 2023 stands at €0.65 per share  representing an 8% increase against FY 2022. This would be the third consecutive year of growth for Quadient’s dividend. The dividend is subject to approval by the Annual General Meeting  scheduled for 14 June 2024  and will be paid in cash in one instalment on 7 August 2024.Cash flow generationEBITDA(6) reached €244 million in FY 2023  representing a slight increase compared to FY 2022  hence an EBITDA margin at 23.0% in FY 2023  vs 22.4% in FY 2022.The change in working capital was negative by €6 million in FY 2023 compared to a net cash outflow of €40 million in FY 2022  mostly reflecting an improvement in stock levels after end of FY 2022 level was impacted by high locker and mail inventories due to delays in placements.The leasing portfolio and other financing services stood at €598 million as of 31 January 2024  compared to €595 million as of 31 January 2023  thanks to the solid performance of the Mail activity and a small positive currency impact. On an organic basis  the leasing portfolio is stable year-over-year. At the end of FY 2023  the default rate of the leasing portfolio stood at around 1.3% compared to c.1.6% at the end of FY 2022.Interest and taxes paid increased significantly to €55 million in FY 2023 versus the low amount of €35 million paid in FY 2022. The difference was mostly explained by the reimbursement of the 2020 tax loss carry-back measures in the US in H1 2022 as well as the impact from higher interest rates in FY 2023.Capital expenditure was up to €101 million in FY 2023  compared to €87 million in FY 2022. Development capex was down slightly at €33 million in FY 2023  vs €36 million in FY 2022  back to a normalized level after high levels experienced in 2022 and 2021. Equipment capex was strongly up year-over-year at €44 million in FY 2023  compared to €30 million in FY 2022  thanks to the sustained level of Mail-Related Solutions hardware placements  as well as the focus on deployment of open locker networks. Maintenance capex is slightly down  at €10 million. The increase in capex linked to IFRS 16 was driven by new office leases.All in all  cash flow after capital expenditure was down to €64 million in FY 2023 compared to €70 million in FY 2022.OPENING BALANCE SHEET ADJUSTMENTS UPDATEAs disclosed in the H1 2023 results press release(7)  released on 20 September 2023  at the time of closing the accounts for the first half of 2023  Quadient identified accounting irregularities and practices that did not comply with Group procedures and were attributable to Mail-Related Solutions’ Italian and Swiss subsidiaries.The investigation  initiated by Quadient in August 2023 in Italy and in Switzerland and conducted both internally and with the support of recognized external experts  is now completed. At the close of the FY 2023  the conclusions of this investigation are as follows:Active involvement of a few employees responsible for the management of the Italian and Swiss Mail-Related Solutions subsidiaries Containment of these accounting irregularities to these local subsidiaries  andAbsence of any material impact on the FY 2022 and FY 2023 income statements.As a result of the investigation carried out  the Group has recorded additional adjustments for €23 million to the accounts of these local subsidiaries relating to previous financial years and recognized in shareholders’ equity in the FY 2022 opening balance sheet (after the €29 million adjustment recorded in H1 2023).As the investigation is now closed  Quadient does not anticipate any additional financial impact on its historical financial statements. The Company has filed a criminal complaint against those believed to be involved and continues to reserve all rights in this matter.In addition and considering the conclusion of the investigation carried out in Italy and in Switzerland (notably showing that the accounting adjustments impacted mostly the accounts of the Italian subsidiary)  the Group decided in January 2024 to review the future of its Mail-Related Solutions activity in Italy and is engaged in the path of divesting this subsidiary within the next 12 months. Consequently  the assets and liabilities of this wholly owned subsidiary are presented in the financial accounts for the year ending 31 January 2024 as assets and liabilities held for sale as per IFRS 5. Its profit and loss accounts and cash flow statements are presented as discontinued operations. The FY 2022 financial statements have been restated to reflect this decision.LEVERAGE AND LIQUIDITY POSITIONNet debt stood at €709 million as of 31 January 2024  a decrease against the €736 million of net financial debt recorded as of 31 January 2023 and adjusted for the aforementioned accounting corrections. In June 2023  the Group renewed its Revolving Credit Facility for an amount of €300 million with a new 5-year maturity. A €90 million stimulus participating loan was also signed in June 2023. From October 2023 to January 2024  Quadient proceeded to a partial bond buy-back for a total amount of €57 million generating a financial gain c.€2 million.The Group has no significant debt maturity before 2025  when its 2.25% bond is maturing.The leverage ratio (net debt/EBITDA) decreased from 3.0x(3) as of 31 January 2023 to 2.9x(3) as of 31 January 2024. Excluding leasing  Quadient leverage ratio improved from 1.8x(3) as of 31 January 2023 to 1.65x(3) as of 31 January 2024  therefore exceeding the 1.75x target set early 2021 for the end of FY 2023.As of 31 January 2024  the Group had a robust liquidity position of €418 million  split between €118 million in cash and a €300 million undrawn credit line  the latter maturing in 2028.Shareholders’ equity stood at €1 069 million as of 31 January 2024 compared to €1 030 million(8) as of 31 January 2023 and adjusted for the aforementioned accounting corrections. The gearing ratio(9) stood at 77.4% as of 31 January 2024.OUTLOOKFY 2023 marks the end of Quadient’s Back to Growth strategic plan  with Phase Two covering the period 2021-2023. From a financial standpoint  the achievements are solid with only a small deviation against the mid-term outlook set in 2021:Organic sales CAGR for the 2021-2023 period was 2.5% in line with the 2.5% mid-term outlook revised in November 2023 (initially set in 2021 at minimum 3% CAGR) Organic current EBIT(2) CAGR(10) was 3.3% over the 2021-2023 period against the minimum mid-single digit organic current EBIT(2) CAGR that was set in 2021.The end of the second phase of Back to Growth also marks the completion of the portfolio rotation that had been planned by Quadient early 2019 when the first phase of Back to Growth was launched. Over the past five years  all non-core assets have been sold or closed and important assets were acquired to complement the Solutions of the Group. Quadient is now an innovative and integrated B-to-B subscription platform  focusing on powering billions of business transactions every day.Quadient’s Solutions have achieved significant milestones over the second phase of Back to Growth. For Intelligent Communication Automation  the second phase of Back to Growth was a phase of cloud transformation. First  on the product side  by acquiring two SaaS financial automation modules (in 2020 and 2021 during phase one) to complete the cloud platform; this was followed in FY 2023 by the launch of the Quadient Hub  an integrated cloud platform combining all modules for Intelligent Communication Automation. This innovative and integrated platform is an important driver of additional usage and upsell. The various modules of the Quadient Hub have received numerous leader rankings from external surveys and analysts highlighting the quality of the offering and its market leadership. The solid growth in ARR  which delivered a 19% CAGR over the period  is the validation from customers of the attractiveness of these solutions. Second  from both a technological and financial standpoint  the Solution has almost completed its move from on-premise licenses to SaaS  temporarily impacting its revenue and profitability trajectory. However  as the level of subscription-related revenue increased (80% in FY 2023  vs. 61% in FY 2020)  an inflexion point has also been reached for the operating profitability in H2 2022. In FY 2023  the solution has been profitable at current EBIT level(2) and further improvement is expected in the years to come.Mail-Related Solutions have been outperforming the market throughout the 2021-2023 period  delivering a 0.6% organic revenue CAGR over the period. Whilst the Solution was significantly impacted by the Covid-19 crisis in terms of loss of revenues  the following years have demonstrated resilience and the success of its strategic choices to focus on re-investing in both its go-to-markets and its smart equipment range. Throughout the second phase of the plan  hardware sales showed strong dynamics  especially in the US that benefited from the USPS decertification and the placement of new generation of machines while the subscription related revenue showed strong resilience over the period. Hardware sales posted three consecutive years of organic growth. This solid performance is also confirmed by the share of upgraded installed base  moving from 4.9% at the end of FY 2020 to 31.5% at the end of FY 2023 demonstrating the sound adoption trend for the new products.Lastly  the financial performance of Parcel Locker Solutions reflects the increased strategic focus towards open networks to drive higher returns per locker. Building on its Japanese network experience  Quadient decided to focus its efforts onto deploying new open networks of parcel lockers  notably in the UK and France. This deployment is based on two major cornerstones: i) strong relationships with international carriers bringing parcel volumes into the networks thanks to long term agreements and ii) ability to secure prime locations to install lockers and benefit from the first mover advantage in the most attractive locations. The initial volume ramp up seen in the existing networks is encouraging. Innovation has also played a key part in the development of the parcel locker offering. Significant new features and models have been developed to respond to a wide range of use cases. Oversize lockers for DIY shops  rear-loading lockers for universities  larger configurations  or the award-winning drop box to consolidate returns are a few of these innovative features. The installed locker base has grown to over 20 000 lockers  a 55% increase vs. the end of 2020 level. This growth has been also driven by a steady expansion of the locker base in the US both in the universities and in the multifamily segments.With the end of the Back to Growth strategy and the Group firmly positioned on a sustainable and profitable growth trajectory  the guidance for FY 2024 is for another year of organic growth both at the revenue and current EBIT(2) levels.Additional financial guidance  three-year strategic focus and trajectory for the Group will be discussed at Quadient’s Capital Markets Day planned for 19 June 2024.Q4 2023 BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTSQuadient surpasses €200 million in Software Annual Recurring Revenue at the end of the third quarter 2023On 30 November 2023  Quadient announced it has reached a significant milestone as its Software Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR)  a forward-looking indicator of future subscription revenue  surpassed €202 million at the end of the third quarter of the 2023 fiscal year  started on 1 February 2023.Quadient expands cloud-based Mail and Shipping offer to mid and small businesses with S.M.A.R.T.

38155,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2024/03/25/it-is-in-a-companys-interest-to-publish-its-tax-strategy/,It is in a company’s interest to publish its tax strategy – The Irish Times,How a firm treats tax can be a powerful indicator of their impact on society,The tax transparency debate continues to gain momentum. Stakeholders are demanding more meaningful information on tax  resulting in some companies opting to publish comprehensive tax disclosures. More and more stakeholders and the public at large want to understand a company’s approach to tax and how much tax it pays. This can only be demonstrated through the information they communicate.More than ever before  it is clear that tax can be used as a powerful indicator of a company’s societal impact and its broader corporate values. But more can be done to achieve this.PwC’s 2024 Tax Transparency report benchmarking the tax disclosures of companies listed on the main market of the Irish stock exchange  Euronext Dublin  reveals that half of companies reviewed voluntarily published a tax strategy – a document that sets out a company’s policies for the management of its tax affairs. Some 40 per cent of companies explicitly stated that their tax strategy was regularly reviewed  and 90 per cent of companies describe how their tax governance and control framework is monitored.[ Joe Biden’s plan for higher corporate tax rate could be bad news for Ireland ]Tax disclosures continue to be redefined by the introduction of mandatory disclosure regulations such as public country-by-country reporting and the corporate sustainability reporting directive (CSRD). Tax is becoming central to the broader environmental  social and governance (ESG) agenda and is an increasingly important sustainability matter. There is no sign of these trends abating and multinational organisations  in particular  must now navigate a diverse range of tax disclosure requirements.READ MOREWhile there is no requirement in Ireland for companies to publish a tax strategy  the report reveals that 50 per cent of companies reviewed voluntarily publish a tax strategy and this is similar to previous years.Trust can be built by companies that adopt a strategic response to tax disclosureIndicating a strong level of oversight on tax matters  all companies confirmed that their board or audit committee is accountable for compliance with the tax strategy.And although the majority of their board or audit committee formally reviews the tax strategy at some stage  just 40 per cent of companies explicitly stated that their tax strategy was regularly reviewed.Some 90 per cent of companies include a statement in their tax strategy describing their tax risk appetite  up 29 per cent from last year.About 80 per cent of companies referenced tax in their broader sustainability reports  up 14 per cent from last year and an acknowledgment by companies that tax is an important sustainability metric.[ Ireland told to shore up corporate tax laws to prevent wealthy from committing tax fraud and evasion ]There was a 29 per cent increase in the number of companies that explain how tax aligns with their business strategy  demonstrating that tax is driven by commercial activity.Consistent with prior years  all of the companies describe their approach to engaging with tax authorities.A fifth of companies voluntarily disclosed some details of their total tax contribution (TTC) information at a jurisdictional level. TTC is the total amount of taxes paid by a company  including taxes borne by the company and taxes collected on behalf of the exchequer.[ Surging business tax receipts trigger bitter Government dispute over capital spending ]TTC disclosures show how much tax a company contributes to the economy  thereby demonstrating its broader societal impact.Trust can be built by companies that adopt a strategic response to tax disclosure. The survey shows that more can be done using tax disclosures to highlight a company’s role in society and to influence stakeholders’ perceptions of its sustainability credentials.Navigating the tax transparency landscape can be challenging. Businesses have to consider stakeholders’ expectations and assess compliance with diverse regulatory and voluntary reporting requirements. There is no optimal level or one-size-fits-all approach to tax transparency. Each company’s perspective is different and will be driven by several factors  including its brand values and stakeholder interests.Aidan Lucey is a tax transparency partner at PwC Ireland,neutral,0.08,0.91,0.01,negative,0.03,0.29,0.68,True,English,"['The Irish Times', 'tax strategy', 'company', 'interest', 'higher corporate tax rate', 'corporate sustainability reporting directive', 'Surging business tax receipts', 'broader corporate values', 'Irish stock exchange', 'important sustainability matter', 'broader sustainability reports', 'important sustainability metric', 'bitter Government dispute', 'voluntary reporting requirements', 'corporate tax laws', 'mandatory disclosure regulations', 'tax risk appetite', 'broader societal impact', 'tax transparency debate', 'tax transparency landscape', 'tax transparency partner', 'tax disclosure requirements', 'total tax contribution', 'comprehensive tax disclosures', '29 per cent increase', '2024 Tax Transparency report', 'country reporting', 'business strategy', 'sustainability credentials', 'total amount', 'brand values', '40 per cent', '90 per cent', '50 per cent', '80 per cent', 'tax strategy', 'tax affairs', 'tax matters', 'tax fraud', 'tax aligns', 'tax authorities', 'powerful indicator', 'main market', 'Euronext Dublin', 'control framework', 'Joe Biden', 'bad news', 'ESG) agenda', 'multinational organisations', 'diverse range', 'previous years', 'strategic response', 'strong level', 'audit committee', 'last year', 'commercial activity', 'prior years', 'jurisdictional level', 'capital spending', 'diverse regulatory', 'optimal level', 'several factors', 'stakeholder interests', 'Aidan Lucey', 'TTC disclosures', 'meaningful information', 'tax governance', 'READ MORE', 'stakeholders’ perceptions', 'stakeholders’ expectations', 'TTC) information', 'PwC Ireland', 'momentum', 'companies', 'public', 'company', 'approach', 'half', 'document', 'policies', 'management', 'plan', 'introduction', 'CSRD', 'social', 'sign', 'trends', 'Trust', 'oversight', 'board', 'compliance', 'majority', 'stage', 'statement', 'acknowledgment', 'wealthy', 'evasion', 'number', 'fifth', 'details', 'taxes', 'exchequer', 'economy', 'survey', 'role', 'society', 'Businesses', 'perspective']",2024-03-25,2024-03-26,irishtimes.com

The second semester showed a notable improvement: more revenue growth  more order intake  and a strong operational cash generation (+59 M€). The company has thus initiated its deleveraging  visible through the decrease in the net debt to current EBITDA ratio at the end of the year.The year 2023 confirmed the interest in the acquisition of iXblue  which exceeded expectations for its first full year. The former iXblue activities recorded a +20% revenue growth and the trend is accelerating for sales of navigation and positioning systems (+27% order intake in 2023). The increase in orders for inertial units is particularly notable in naval defense applications  but the company is also making headway in the land defense domain.In the field of underwater mine clearance  Exail Technologies has been facing particularly intense commercial activity since mid-2023. After the years 2021 and 2022 without significant tender results  many navies are advancing simultaneously. Positioned as a leader in demining solutions with drones  Exail is consistently solicited. The company has also won its first program in the Middle East at the end of 2023 against major competing defense groups. The Group is expecting further progress  in the short or medium term by 2024  regarding several particularly significant programs.In this context  Exail Technologies chooses to respond to all opportunities. Beyond the significant increase in costs for responding to calls for tenders  this choice results in a particularly heavy workload for the technical teams. This workload temporarily creates a disruption in the allocation of ressources  penalizing profitability. The Navigation & Maritime Robotics segment thus generated a current EBITDA margin of 22% in 2023  below expectations for the second half. This situation is expected to continue for at least the first 6 months of the year 2024. However  Exail Technologies aims at an absolute growth in its current EBITDA in 2024.Income statement 2023Application of IFRS 3R standard and restatement of previous year's financial information.The IFRS 3R - Business Combinations standard provides that the finalization of the fair value assessment of acquired assets and liabilities must be subject to retrospective modifications as if the modifications had been made at the date of entry into the scope. As part of the acquisition of iXblue  which entered the scope on October 1  2022  the valuations that had been carried out in 2022 were provisional and were finalized in 2023. Therefore  the 2022 accounts were modified to incorporate the completion of this work.The intangible assets related to technology and customer relationships have been revalued upwards to €250 million (+ €210 million). These assets are amortizable. As a result  the residual goodwill has decreased and is now €126 million. Consequently  Exail Technologies records an amortization of intangible assets recognized at fair value of €18 million in 2023 in the ""Other operating income and expenses"" line. This level of amortization will continue in the coming years.Furthermore  in terms of the balance sheet  the Group has changed the method of accounting for commitments to purchase minority interests. An explanation of this change  which has no impact on the results  is available in the appendix of this press release.The last sale of the activities of the former Engineering & Protection Systems division was completed at the end of the first quarter of 2023. This operation generated a receipt of €30 million for Exail Technologies  and the capital gain is fully recognized in the accounts of the first half of the year.

This segment includes the group's two main vertically integrated activities: the sale of navigation and positioning systems and the marketing of drones and autonomous drone systems for maritime applications. The revenue growth is driven by three important growth drivers:The progress of major ongoing defense programs   including programs to combat underwater mines. The contribution of the program to the Belgian and Dutch navies is approximately €55 million (+€10 million compared to 2022  in line with the order book flow plan).  including programs to combat underwater mines. The contribution of the program to the Belgian and Dutch navies is approximately €55 million (+€10 million compared to 2022  in line with the order book flow plan). The growth of navigation systems  particularly in the maritime domain  with an increasing number of units delivered. The naval defense sector has been particularly strong this year  and the civilian maritime sector remains dynamic.particularly in the maritime domain  with an increasing number of units delivered. The naval defense sector has been particularly strong this year  and the civilian maritime sector remains dynamic. The breakthrough in booming civilian applications through differentiated solutions  such as underwater drone mapping  notably with our surface drone DriX.Advanced Technologies Segment: strong demand translates into record deliveriesThe components and products of this segment are sold directly to third parties or integrated into the Navigation & Maritime Robotics segment systems. The ramp-up in production pace of this segment continues and has been able to meet the significant deliveries of the year  both for internal needs and for external customers. As a result  revenues for this segment are increasing by +19%.The highly diversified customer base includes many leading players in lasers  telecommunications  aerospace  space  defense  and quantum  who rely on Exail as a strategic and recurring supplier.More details on the 2023 revenues are available in the dedicated press release published on February 26  2024 (link to the press release).Financial results at a good levelOperating result by segment[4](in €million) FY2023 FY 2022equivalent scope[5] VarM€ Var.% Navigation& Maritime Robotics Revenues 245 3 210 9 +34 +16% Current EBITDA 53 3 - - - Current EBITDA margin (%) 21 7% - - - Income form ordinary activities 37 7 - - - Advanced technologies Revenues 84 9 71 3 +14 +19% Current EBITDA 14 3 - - - Current EBITDA margin (%) 16 9% - - - Income form ordinary activities 9 3 - - -A current EBITDA margin of 20%Exail Technologies achieved €65 million in current EBITDA in 2023  with a strong contribution from the Navigation & Maritime Robotics segment. This segment generated a 22% current EBITDA margin  which was below the group's targets in the second half of 2023. The intense commercial activity is temporarily weighing on the profitability of ongoing programs and leading to high costs of participating in tenders (€4 M in 2023 for the group  a record level). This factor mainly explains the 1 6 point decrease in the current EBITDA margin rate between 2023 and 2022 at a comparable scope.The Advanced Technologies segment achieved a current EBITDA margin of 17%. It includes high-profit activities such as optical fibers for laser applications  and growing activities (such as ground drones and certain quantum instruments) that did not contribute to the group's profitability this year. The profitability of this division also suffered from weak sales of autonomous drones for the logistics sector (AMR). The group has decided to stop this activity due to its much slower development than expected.An operating result of €7 millionDepreciation and provisions amounted to €25 million in 2023  a stable level compared to the previous year. The operating profit thus stands at €40 million.Other elements of the operating result represent a charge of €33 million  mainly without impact on cash flow. They include:€18 million in amortization of assets recognized at fair value in accordance with IFRS 3R (see the dedicated paragraph on this subject earlier in this press release).€8 million related to incentive and retention plans for employees implemented by iXblue (renamed EXAIL) before its acquisition by the group  plans implemented for management since the acquisition  and the latest costs related to the acquisition of iXblue.€5 million comes from the decrease in the value of Prodways Group[6] shares. Almost all of the Prodways Group shares still held by the group were distributed to shareholders in June 2023.As a result  the Group's operating result stands at €7 million.Cost of financial debt : €25 million with partial effect on cash-flowThe net cost of financial debt amounts to €25 million in 2023  an increase due to the acquisition of iXblue finalized in September 2022. A significant portion of the interest expenses - the interest on bonds issued to ICG - is capitalized and therefore has no effect on cash flow. This amount represents €11 million in 2023.Disbursements related to debt interest represent just over half of the expense shown in the income statement. They are increasing compared to 2022 at a comparable scope due to the rise in interest rates. These costs are expected to decrease in the coming years with the gradual deleveraging of the company.Other financial income and expenses amount to -€1 million compared to +€4 million in 2022. They included in 2022 a gain recognized on the fair value of hedging instruments.Cash generation: a significant improvement in the second half of 2023Exail Technologies generated an operational cash flow of +56 million euros in 2023  with a strong increase in the second half (+59 million euros). This result is mainly due to a significant improvement in the working capital requirement in the second half of the year  linked mainly to the seasonal billing milestones of the Belgian-Dutch program. The working capital requirement remained stable throughout the year 2023.Capex amounted to 32 million euros  mainly including investments in R&D (for 22 million euros)  as well as investments in certain production tools. This level is relatively stable compared to the evolution of the turnover.Furthermore  Exail Technologies generated +9 million euros in cash  mainly through the sale of a real estate asset and two major operations: the group sold the ISP division in the first half of 2023; this product was used in July 2023 to acquire 5% of the subsidiary EXAIL Holding for 24.5 million euros (more details on this operation are available in the press release of July 26  2023).Financial structure by the end of 2023: debt reduction underwayThe acquisition of iXblue was made possible without Exail Technologies raising capital  thanks to leverage created at the EXAIL HOLDING subsidiary level. This financial structure offers significant potential for value creation  due to the amplification of the group's growth effects through financial leverage. The operation was financed by bank loans  for €185 million  and instruments (equity and bonds) subscribed by partner ICG for €231 million. The bonds have no impact on cash flow until ICG exits (capitalized interest).The group's profitability allows it to easily meet its bank covenants by the end of 2023.The group's adjusted net debt3  excluding ICG bonds  decreased in 2023. It stands at €174 million compared to €184 million a year ago. The group's net debt to current EBITDA ratio is therefore significantly lower  from 3.0x to 2.7x over one year (on a comparable basis).Outlook€324 million in order intake by 2023  growing by +14%The Navigation & Maritime Robotics segment is the driving force behind this year's orders  with €244 million in new contracts  up +24% from last year on a comparable basis.This performance is primarily driven by a significant increase in orders for navigation systems  totaling €144 million in 2023 (+27%). This is the result of commercial successes in all application areas:Many important naval defense contracts  such as the modernization of the US Coast Guard fleet or the equipment of the future anti-submarine frigates of the Netherlands;Record orders in civil maritime  both for maritime transport and for operations at sea  by boats or drones;The development of terrestrial and space applications  notably with the successful launch of the new Astrix-New space model for satellite constellations.In maritime robotics  order intakes reached €100 million with a notable success at the end of 2023  the result of long and intense commercial efforts: following an international tender for a Defense application  Exail Technologies signed a €28 million contract to provide a drone system to the United Arab Emirates Navy.In the field of naval defense  the group also recorded €63 million in additional orders from existing customers  such as the Belgian Navy. Sales of drones for civilian applications have increased this year  particularly with the DriX drone dedicated to surveying.The Advanced Technologies segment recorded €79 million in external orders in 2023  achieving a good performance. Half of these orders are generated by sales of advanced optical and quantum components to a diversified customer base. The other half includes critical equipment for civil aviation (such as distress beacons).Compared to 2022 on a comparable basis  the level of order intake is €9 million lower due to an exceptionally large contract for this segment (around €20 million) that was signed in December 2022.The order book at the end of 2023 stands at €630 million  which is nearly two years of revenue.Growing and well-oriented markets  particularly in defenseThe annual defense spending growth of NATO member countries reached +10% in 2023  with +21% for European countries. Among these significant increases  the share of budgets dedicated to the development of autonomous naval solutions is also increasing. The United States is at the forefront of this trend  with Task Force 59 specializing in unmanned capabilities. Deployed in the Middle East  it monitors 2.5 million square miles and has conducted over 60 000 hours of drone operations. France  in its new Military Programming Law  explicitly plans for autonomous solutions for underwater demining and deep surveillance capabilities.For the year 2024  Exail Technologies indicates three major trends:The progress of the program for the Belgian and Dutch navies suggests stable activity in 2024. The growth of the Navigation & Maritime Robotics segment will therefore be driven by Navigation  which is expected to grow by more than 15%. The Advanced Technologies segment should also grow by more than 15%.For the entire 2024 fiscal year  Exail Technologies aims for double-digit revenue growth.2. As explained in the introduction of this press release  temporary disruptions induced by intense commercial context are expected to continue for at least the first 6 months of the fiscal year. However  Exail Technologies aims at an absolute growth in its current EBITDA in 2024.3. Several important tenders are currently being negotiated. The Group is expecting further progress  in the short or medium term by 2024  regarding a few of them.About Exail TechnologiesExail Technologies is the new name of Groupe Gorgé  adopted after the transformation of the group at the end of 2022  now focused on the activities of its subsidiary Exail.

(Euronext Paris: QDT)  a leader in business solutions for meaningful customer connections through digital and physical channels  today announces its 2023 fourth-quarter consolidated sales and full-year results (period ended on 31 January 2024). The full-year 2023 results were approved by the Board of Directors during a meeting held on 22 March 2024.Geoffrey Godet  Chief Executive Officer of Quadient S.A.  stated: ""By thoroughly executing our Back to Growth strategic plan over the past five years  we successfully repositioned Quadient as an integrated and innovative B-to-B subscription platform  powering billions of connections every day and meeting a wide range of essential business and communication needs. To deliver our strategic vision  we divested non-core activities and selectively acquired several key assets. This now provides us with the opportunity to leverage our 400 000+ customer base  having developed integrated  fast growing  synergistic  and therefore highly relevant solutions.""More specifically  the second phase of our plan  launched three years ago  was aimed at setting Quadient on a sustainable top line and current EBIT(2) growth trajectory. Today's results confirm the positive trend followed by Quadient since the low point reached in 2021 and evidenced by the 9.3% organic growth recorded in 2023.

The change in scope is related to the divestments of the Graphic activities in the Nordics and the Shipping business in France  both sold in June 2022 as well as the acquisition of Daylight in September 2023. The FY 2023 financial statements reflect Quadient's decision to review the future of its Mail activity in Italy with a view to divest this subsidiary within the next 12 months.

At c.+10% in the FY 2023  usage has increased further. The share of SaaS customers also improved  reaching 82% at the end of FY 2023.The change in business model from on-premise licenses to SaaS and the lower requirements for installation and support services continue to drive the decline in professional services and license sales  which  together  are now representing only 13% and 7% of total revenue  respectively. At the end of FY 2023  annual recurring revenue (ARR)  which is a forward-looking indicator of future subscription-related revenue  reached €206 million  up from €187 million at the end of FY 2022  representing a 12.1% organic(4) growth compared to the end of FY 2022. Organic growth for the year was impacted by the postponement of two large contracts recorded in Q3 2023.Throughout FY 2023  Quadient continued to sign significant partnerships  notably with Altares and Coface  to offer highly accurate company rating and credit analysis for its Accounts Receivable module. Quadient financial automation modules are now also recommended to Sage Intacct customers and partners  with Quadient reaching Sage Tech Partner plus status. In addition  Quadient solutions are now integrated with global small business platform Xero  offering their customers access to Quadient's Accounts Payable automation capabilities to drive efficiencies.In the course of the year  Quadient Software product offering benefitted from continuous improvements with:▪ The launch of the Quadient Hub▪ The addition of Daylight  acquired in Q3 2023  rebranded Inspire iForms and subsequently relaunched;▪ Enhanced Cash Application module with machine learning and new next-gen payment user interface;▪ On-premise solutions enhanced with private cloud deployment options.Q4 2023 sales were up by 7.2% on an organic basis to €66 million with positive performance from all geographies.

This solid improvement comes as Quadient's Software Solution has almost completed its transition from on-premise licenses to SaaS. It confirms the upturn in profitability trend seen since the inflexion point in H2 2022  despite continued investments in R&D and product developments. The improving profitability trend is expected to continue in FY 2024 supported by a good level of SaaS bookings.Mail-Related SolutionsMail-Related Solutions sales reached €729 million in FY 2023  down only (0.2)% on an organic basis and down (2.4)% on a reported basis. North America and International recorded strong performances with year-over-year organic growth  while Main European Countries showed a contained decline thanks to improving trends in France/Benelux.Hardware sales recorded a 2.1% organic growth in FY 2023  with a solid performance in Q4  notably a double-digit increase in the United States. The focus on investing into renewing the products offering continues to support solid product(4) FY 2023 ARR was impacted by a€4.0 million negative currency effect vs. 31 January 2023placements  as seen in the further increase in the share of the upgraded installed base  reaching 31.5% at the end of FY 2023 vs. 19.9% at the end of FY 2022.Subscription-related revenues (68% of Mail-Related Solution sales) recorded a limited (1.3)% organic decline in FY 2023  thanks to a solid performance throughout the year  supported both by robust rental product placements and the positive impact on recurring revenue of recent good performance in hardware sales. Solid year-over-year increase in bookings throughout FY 2023 reflect the focus on maintaining an efficient go-to-market  drawing in particular on innovative products. The multiple contracts recently won within the US healthcare industry highlight how Quadient Mail-Related Solutions is able to strengthen its position in an attractive industry with critical communications needs.Q4 2023 sales continued to show strong resilience  reaching €196 million in Q4  up by 0.3% on an organic basis. Of note  the strong performance in hardware sales  up 3.4% year-over-year on an organic basis.Current EBIT(2) for Mail-Related Solutions was €177 million for FY 2023. Current EBIT(2) margin reached 24.3%. The level of profitability of Mail-Related Solutions remains high despite investments in sales capabilities. Tight cost control and continued focus on remanufacturing  as well as the increased penetration of the new generation of mail equipment all contributed to this strong performance.Parcel Locker SolutionsParcel Locker Solutions sales reached €88 million in FY 2023  a 1.6% increase on an organic basis and a (3.1)% decrease compared to FY 2022. Quadient's global locker installed base reached c.20 200 units at the end of FY 2023 vs. c.18 000 units at the end of FY 2022. Over the 2021-2023 period  it represents an 18% average increase per annum.Subscription-related revenues were up 5.3% organically in FY 2023  benefiting from the contribution of the existing installed base and the deployment of existing contracts. Subscription-related revenue stood at 61% of total revenue for Parcel Locker Solutions in FY 2023 and the usage rate of the platform remained solid  standing at 58% in FY 2023.FY 2023 has been a year of transition for Parcel Locker Solutions with two material events: i) an increased focus on open-networks in France and in the UK and ii) the renewal in July 2023 of the joint-venture with Yamato with significant changes brought to the commercial agreement - from a mostly fixed rental model to a fee per parcel model (based on usage consumption) - to maximize volume usage. Consequently  the FY 2023 performance reflects these changes. Based on strong relationships with a significant number of international carriers  the open network strategy is aiming at growing both usage & the installed base through:▪ securing volumes with international carriers (GLS  Evri  UPS  DHL  Yamato Transport…);▪ prime locations to install parcel lockers.Solid volumes ramp up into the existing open networks and continuous efforts to secure prime locations and accelerate lockers deployment should drive future growth in subscription-related revenue.License and hardware sales were down (7.5)% organically in FY 2023. Hardware sales suffered from high comparison basis due to one off deals in FY 2022. Quadient's US multifamily business  however  has continued to grow at a steady pace in FY 2023.Q4 2023 sales stood at €22 million in Q4 2023  a (4.8)% organic decline due to a high comparison basis in International with one-off deals in Q4 2022 as well as the impact from the Yamato contract renegotiation.Current EBIT(2) for Parcel Locker Solutions was negative at €(21) million in FY 2023  compared to €(25) million in FY 2022  i.e. an EBIT margin(2) of (23.4)%  improving by 4.4 points compared to FY 2022. The improvement in operating profitability was led by gross margin expansion through efficiency measures and lower freight costs. Profitability is expected to continue improving in 2024. Lastly  profitability of the installed base continues to increase year-over-year  standing at 13.6% in FY 2023 vs. 12.5% in FY 2022.Consolidated sales by geographyFY 2023 consolidated salesIn € million FY 2023 FY 2022 Change Organic change North America 607 599 +1.4% +4.5% Main European countries(a) 354 356 (0.8)% (2.4)% International(b) 101 116 (12.3)% +1.9% Group total 1 062 1 071 (0.8)% +1.9%(a) Including Austria  Benelux  France  Germany  Ireland  Italy (excluding MRS)  Switzerland  and the United Kingdom(b) International includes the activities of Intelligent Communication Automation  Mail-Related Solutions and Parcel Locker Solutions outside of North America and the Main European countries as well as  in Q1 2022  other solutions previously recorded under Additional Operation and divested in Q2 2022Sales in North America (57% of Group sales) were up 4.5% organically and 1.4% on a reported basis to €607 million. All three Solutions posted organic growth in FY 2023. Intelligent Communication Automation was the main contributor to the growth in the region with a solid double-digit organic growth. Penetration of Quadient's cloud-based solutions continues to be well supported by successful cross-selling from the Mail customer base. Mail-Related Solutions continued to show positive performance  benefiting from the solid penetration of recently launched products meeting the requirements brought by the ongoing USPS decertification. North America posted 4.9% organic growth in the fourth quarter driven by the growth in the three solutions.Main European countries (33% of Group sales) were down by (2.4)% organically and (0.8)% on a reported basis to €354 million  due to a limited decline from Mail-Related Solutions  and despite:▪ The positive contribution from Intelligent Communication Automation with a good penetration of recently launched products  and▪ Organic growth in Parcel Locker Solutions supported by both the ramp up in volumes in the open networks and the on-going deployment of existing contracts.Main European Countries posted a 1.8% organic decline in Q4 2023  with a contained decline from Mail-Related Solutions and solid organic growth from Intelligent Communication Automation.Finally  the International segment (10% of Group sales) delivered a 1.9% organic growth  to €101 million  thanks to solid performance in Intelligence Communication Automation and Mail-Related Solutions partially compensated by both the impact from the change in contractual agreement with Yamato and the temporary slowdown in the expansion of the Japanese lockers network.

Higher interest rates on the variable portion of the debt (one third of Quadient's debt) and the c.€2 million financial gain on the partial €57 million buy back of the 2025 bond over the October 2023 - January 2024 period were the main factors behind the variation. The currency gains & losses and other financial items were a loss of €(1) million in FY 2023 versus a loss of €(4) million in FY 2022. Overall  net financial result was a loss of €31 million in FY 2023 compared to a loss of €36 million in FY 2022.Income tax expense was stable year-over-year at €17 million in FY 2023 and benefitted from a positive impact of internal IP transfer in 2023.The corporate tax rate dropped to 16.6% in FY 2023 compared to 54.8% in FY 2022.

Maintenance capex is slightly down  at €10 million. The increase in capex linked to IFRS 16 was driven by new office leases.All in all  cash flow after capital expenditure was down to €64 million in FY 2023 compared to €70 million in FY 2022.(5) For the FY 2023  the average compounded number of shares is 34 520 833(6) EBITDA = current operating income + provisions for depreciation of tangible and intangible fixed assets.OPENING BALANCE SHEET ADJUSTMENTS UPDATEAs disclosed in the H1 2023 results press release(7)  released on 20 September 2023  at the time of closing the accounts for the first half of 2023  Quadient identified accounting irregularities and practices that did not comply with Group procedures and were attributable to Mail-Related Solutions' Italian and Swiss subsidiaries.The investigation  initiated by Quadient in August 2023 in Italy and in Switzerland and conducted both internally and with the support of recognized external experts  is now completed. At the close of the FY 2023  the conclusions of this investigation are as follows:▪ Active involvement of a few employees responsible for the management of the Italian and Swiss Mail-Related Solutions subsidiaries ▪ Containment of these accounting irregularities to these local subsidiaries  and▪ Absence of any material impact on the FY 2022 and FY 2023 income statements.As a result of the investigation carried out  the Group has recorded additional adjustments for €23 million to the accounts of these local subsidiaries relating to previous financial years and recognized in shareholders' equity in the FY 2022 opening balance sheet (after the €29 million adjustment recorded in H1 2023).As the investigation is now closed  Quadient does not anticipate any additional financial impact on its historical financial statements. The Company has filed a criminal complaint against those believed to be involved and continues to reserve all rights in this matter.In addition and considering the conclusion of the investigation carried out in Italy and in Switzerland (notably showing that the accounting adjustments impacted mostly the accounts of the Italian subsidiary)  the Group decided in January 2024 to review the future of its Mail-Related Solutions activity in Italy and is engaged in the path of divesting this subsidiary within the next 12 months. Consequently  the assets and liabilities of this wholly owned subsidiary are presented in the financial accounts for the year ending 31 January 2024 as assets and liabilities held for sale as per IFRS 5. Its profit and loss accounts and cash flow statements are presented as discontinued operations. The FY 2022 financial statements have been restated to reflect this decision.LEVERAGE AND LIQUIDITY POSITIONNet debt stood at €709 million as of 31 January 2024  a decrease against the €736 million of net financial debt recorded as of 31 January 2023 and adjusted for the aforementioned accounting corrections.

From a financial standpoint  the achievements are solid with only a small deviation against the mid-term outlook set in 2021:▪ Organic sales CAGR for the 2021-2023 period was 2.5% in line with the 2.5% mid-term outlook revised in November 2023 (initially set in 2021 at minimum 3% CAGR) ▪ Organic current EBIT(2) CAGR(10) was 3.3% over the 2021-2023 period against the minimum mid-single digit organic current EBIT(2) CAGR that was set in 2021.The end of the second phase of Back to Growth also marks the completion of the portfolio rotation that had been planned by Quadient early 2019 when the first phase of Back to Growth was launched. Over the past five years  all non-core assets have been sold or closed and important assets were acquired to complement the Solutions of the Group. Quadient is now an innovative and integrated B-to-B subscription platform  focusing on powering billions of business transactions every day.Quadient's Solutions have achieved significant milestones over the second phase of Back to Growth. For Intelligent Communication Automation  the second phase of Back to Growth was a phase of cloud transformation. First  on the product side  by acquiring two SaaS financial automation modules (in 2020 and 2021 during phase one) to complete the cloud platform; this was followed in FY 2023 by the launch of the Quadient Hub  an integrated cloud platform combining all modules for Intelligent Communication Automation. This innovative and integrated platform is an important driver of additional usage and upsell. The various modules of the Quadient Hub have received numerous leader rankings from external surveys and analysts highlighting the quality of the offering and its market leadership. The solid growth in ARR  which delivered a 19% CAGR over the period  is the validation from customers of the attractiveness of these solutions.Second  from both a technological and financial standpoint  the Solution has almost completed its move from on-premise licenses to SaaS  temporarily impacting its revenue and profitability trajectory. However  as the level of subscription-related revenue increased (80% in FY 2023  vs. 61% in FY 2020)  an inflexion point has also been reached for the operating profitability in H2 2022. In FY 2023  the solution has been profitable at current EBIT level(2) and further improvement is expected in the years to come.Mail-Related Solutions have been outperforming the market throughout the 2021-2023 period  delivering a 0.6% organic revenue CAGR over the period. Whilst the Solution was significantly impacted by the Covid-19 crisis in terms of loss of revenues  the following years have demonstrated resilience and the success of its strategic choices to focus on re-investing in both its go-to-markets and its smart equipment range. Throughout the second phase of the plan  hardware sales showed strong dynamics  especially in the US that benefited from the USPS decertification and the placement of new generation of machines while the subscription related revenue showed strong resilience over the period. Hardware sales posted three consecutive years of organic growth. This solid performance is also confirmed by the share of upgraded installed base  moving from 4.9% at the end of FY 2020 to 31.5% at the end of FY 2023 demonstrating the sound adoption trend for the new products.Lastly  the financial performance of Parcel Locker Solutions reflects the increased strategic focus towards open networks to drive higher returns per locker. Building on its Japanese network experience  Quadient decided to focus its efforts onto deploying new open networks of parcel lockers  notably in the UK and France. This deployment is based on two major cornerstones: i) strong relationships with international carriers bringing parcel volumes into the networks thanks to long term agreements and ii) ability to secure prime locations to install lockers and benefit from the first mover advantage in the most attractive locations. The initial volume ramp up seen in the existing networks is encouraging. Innovation has also played a key part in the development of the parcel locker offering. Significant new features and models have been developed to respond to a wide range of use cases. Oversize lockers for DIY shops  rear-loading lockers for universities  larger configurations  or the award-winning drop box to consolidate returns are a few of these innovative features. The installed locker base has grown to over 20 000 lockers  a 55% increase vs. the end of 2020 level.
