On the other hand  the margins in DF Group's core business have declined.According to preliminary unaudited figures  earnings before taxes amounted to EUR 3.5 million  which is below the figure projected in July 2023 (EUR 4.7 million). This is mainly due to significantly higher legal consulting costs in connection with the special audit as well as increased costs for the stock exchange listing and the audits of the interim and annual financial statements. Interest expenses also increased significantly due to the general interest rate trend.The preliminary unaudited consolidated net profit for the 2023 financial year amounts to EUR 1.7 million or EUR 0.14/share (previous year: EUR 5.4 million or EUR 0.45/share). In addition to the market uncertainty  the margin loss and the increased costs mentioned above  the reasons for this significant decline in the consolidated result are the utilization of deferred taxes in the amount of EUR 1.1 million due to the change in the planning calculation.According to preliminary figures  DF AG's cash and cash equivalents amounted to EUR 41.9 million as of 31 December 2023.As announced  the audited figures will be published on April 30  2024 at the latest.The Executive BoardDF Deutsche Forfait AGGustav-Heinemann-Ufer 5650968 KölnContact Person AdHoc:DF Deutsche Forfait AGGuido JanzenGustav-Heinemann-Ufer 56  50968 KölnT +49 221 97376-61E investor.relations@dfag.de www.dfag.de,neutral,0.01,0.98,0.01,negative,0.01,0.19,0.8,True,English,"['DF Deutsche Forfait AG', 'Preliminary figures', 'financial year', 'EQS-Adhoc', 'preliminary unaudited consolidated net profit', 'general interest rate trend', 'DF Deutsche Forfait AG', 'higher legal consulting costs', 'two DF companies', 'Key word(s', 'former correspondent bank', 'stock exchange listing', 'The Executive Board', 'Contact Person AdHoc', 'preliminary unaudited figures', 'EQS Group AG', 'annual financial statements', 'overall market uncertainty', 'lower gross result', 'DF AG', 'consolidated result', 'DF Group', 'Preliminary figures', 'Interest expenses', 'Preliminary Results', 'EQS News', 'financial year', 'inside information', 'previous year', 'business volume', 'one hand', 'month-long blockade', 'special audit', 'other hand', 'core business', 'margin loss', 'significant decline', 'planning calculation', '50968 Köln', 'Guido Janzen', 'deferred taxes', 'cash equivalents', 'CET', 'CEST', 'Disclosure', 'Article', 'Regulation', 'service', 'issuer', 'content', 'announcement', 'Cologne', 'ISIN', 'reasons', 'funds', 'Bafin', 'margins', 'earnings', 'July', 'connection', 'audits', 'interim', 'EUR', 'addition', 'utilization', 'amount', '31 December', 'April', 'Gustav-Heinemann-Ufer', 'investor', 'relations', 'dfag']",2024-03-27,2024-03-27,stock-world.de

There are currently no preventive vaccines or effective treatments available against ZIKV. As such  this mosquito-borne disease remains a public health threat and is included in the Food and Drug Administration’s Tropical Disease Priority Review Voucher Program1.The randomized  placebo-controlled  Phase 1 trial  VLA1601-102  is planned to enroll approximately 150 participants aged 18 to 49 years in the United States. Participants will receive a low  medium or high dose of VLA1601. In addition  the low dose of VLA1601 will be evaluated with an additional adjuvant  either the CpG 1018® adjuvant from Dynavax Technologies Corporation or 3M-052-AF adjuvant from the Access to Advanced Health Institute (AAHI). Topline data from the trial are expected in the first half of 2025.VLA1601 is being developed on the original manufacturing platform of Valneva’s licensed Japanese encephalitis (JE) vaccine IXIARO®  which was further optimized to develop the Company’s inactivated  adjuvanted COVID-19 vaccine VLA2001  the first COVID-19 vaccine to receive a standard marketing authorization in Europe. Phase 1 results from Valneva’s first-generation Zika vaccine candidate were reported in 2018 showing a favorable safety profile and immunogenicity in all tested doses and schedules2.Juan Carlos Jaramillo M.D.  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  said  “Valneva’s commitment to our vision – to live in a world in which no one dies or suffers from a vaccine-preventable disease – fuels our pursuit for preparedness solutions against the Zika virus. As global temperatures rise and rainfall increases  the habitat for disease-carrying mosquitoes expands  presenting an ongoing public health challenge.”A vaccine against ZIKV would nicely complement Valneva’s portfolio of travel vaccines against mosquito-borne diseases. The Company received U.S. approval for its chikungunya vaccine IXCHIQ®  the world first and only chikungunya vaccine to address this unmet medical need  in November 2023  and has been commercializing its JE vaccine IXIARO®  for over ten years. Some health authorities and scientific leaders in the field have indicated a preference for a purified inactivated vaccine method compared to other vaccine technologies. This preference stems from the understanding that the primary recipients of a Zika vaccine are anticipated to be women of childbearing age  potentially including those who are pregnant.About the Zika VirusThe Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that was first discovered in 1947. The first human cases were detected in 1952. Since then  disease outbreaks have been reported in tropical Africa  Southeast Asia  the Pacific Islands  and  in 2015  in the Americas. Zika virus is currently circulating in Mexico  Central and South America  many countries and territories in the Caribbean region  and in a small number of geographically limited areas of the continental United States. To date  a total of 89 countries and territories have reported evidence of mosquito transmitted Zika virus infection; however  surveillance remains limited globally.According to the World Health Organization  there is scientific consensus that ZIKV is a cause of microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome. Since 2013  31 countries and territories have reported cases of microcephaly and other central nervous system malformations associated with ZIKV infection.About VLA1601VLA1601 is a highly purified inactivated vaccine candidate against the Zika virus (ZIKV)  developed on the original manufacturing platform of Valneva’s licensed Japanese encephalitis vaccine IXIARO®  which was further optimized to develop the Company’s inactivated  adjuvanted COVID-19 vaccine VLA2001  the first COVID-19 vaccine to receive a standard marketing authorization in Europe. Valneva reported positive Phase 1 results for VLA1601 in 20183. The vaccine candidate was immunogenic and showed a favorable safety profile in all tested doses and schedules that was comparable to IXIARO® and other clinical stage ZIKV vaccines.About IXIARO®/JESPECT®Valneva’s Japanese encephalitis vaccine is indicated for active immunization for the prevention of the disease for people who travel to  or live in  endemic areas. It received marketing approval in the U.S.  Europe  Canada  Hong Kong  Singapore  and Israel under the trade name IXIARO® and in Australia and New Zealand where it is marketed as JESPECT®. It is the only vaccine available to the U.S. military for Japanese Encephalitis. IXIARO® is approved for use in individuals two months of age and older in the U.S. and EU member states  Canada  Norway  Liechtenstein  Iceland  Singapore  Hong Kong  Japan  the Republic of Korea and Israel. In all other licensed territories  IXIARO®/JESPECT® is indicated for use in persons aged 18 years or more.About IXCHIQ®In the U.S.  IXCHIQ® is a live-attenuated vaccine indicated for the prevention of disease caused by chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in individuals 18 years of age and older who are at increased risk of exposure to CHIKV. As for all products approved under FDA’s accelerated approval pathway  continued approval for this indication is contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory studies.Please click here for full Prescribing Information for IXCHIQ®.About Valneva SEWe are a specialty vaccine company that develops  manufactures  and commercializes prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases addressing unmet medical needs.

A recent study by the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) reveals a worrying uptick in online piracy within Europe  with a 3.3% increase in 2022 reversing a previous decline from 2017 to 2021. TV content constitutes nearly half of all piracy  while live sports event piracy has also surged due to streaming platforms' popularity. EUIPO's Executive Director emphasizes the necessity of understanding piracy mechanisms to implement effective policies.Counterspy goes beyond traditional methods to ensure top-tier security for media app subscribers  safeguarding content across various devices. It fills the gap in authentication created by the shift from operator-controlled set top box hardware to retail or app-based OTT clients  allowing operators to distribute content confidently while preventing piracy. With Counterspy  each app instance is authenticated and tied to a specific subscriber  ensuring transparency and control over access. By safeguarding the authentication token from theft or manipulation  Counterspy prevents abuse and ensures legitimate access to content  going above and beyond traditional DRM vendors. More information is available at www.verimatrix.com/anti-piracy/counterspy .Operators can schedule a Counterspy demo time in Verimatrix’s suite during the NAB show or visit www.verimatrix.com/anti-piracy/talk-to-us .“In a time where premium content theft is only a prompt away  siphoning video revenues into piracy networks and multiplying CDN costs  Verimatrix’ Counterspy brings back control and visibility to video operators  they were longing for since moving into OTT ” said Andrew Bear  head of anti-piracy business at Verimatrix.Verimatrix’s demo event at this year’s NAB Show comes amid the recent publishing of the company’s latest white paper  “Securing the Streaming Seas ” which showcases Counterspy’s unmatched defenses against video piracy in today’s entertainment ecosystem that is heavily dominated by video apps.

Amidst fierce competition from the US and China  De Croo has aligned Belgium's biotech vision with the European Commission's global ambition.,Europe must work to protect its biotech leadership capability  Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo told Euractiv. Amidst fierce competition from the US and China  De Croo’s vision aligns with the European Commission’s ambitions for strengthening the sector  citing the Belgian Health & Biotech Valley as the example to follow.Despite Belgium’s size  its biotech industry is thriving. With ten Belgian biotech companies listed on Euronext Brussels with a market cap of €22.8 billion – accounting for 75% of the sector’s European stock market value – Belgium also boasts over 600 companies in the biotechnology sector and strong research clusters such as imec and VIB.On March 20  the European Commission proposed a series of targeted actions to boost biotechnology and biomanufacturing in Europe. De Croo told Euractiv: “Europe and Belgium are currently at the absolute forefront globally when it comes to biotech. However  this strong position is not guaranteed in the future. The US and China are also fully committed to biotech.”He added: “The new biotech initiative must ensure that we remain the leading force. That’s why we’re focusing on all the aspects that matter: from financing to development and production to maintain the sector’s European presence.”Next step  an action planOn March 20  the European Commission proposed a series of targeted actions to boost biotechnology and biomanufacturing in Europe. “(…) the sector has been asking for some of these reforms and plans for a while ” Chairman of flanders.bio and biotech entrepreneur Dirk Reyn told Euractiv.According to Tineke Van hooland  Deputy Secretary General of bio.be/essenscia  for over a year the Belgian prime minister has been urging the European Commission to boost the European biotech sector. “It is very positive that Europe is now coming up with its own initiative ” she said. Van hooland emphasised the essential need for the next European Commission to swiftly translate proposals into a targeted action plan  “It’s not just about visions and words  but actions ” she emphasised.Bio.be/essenscia  the Belgian federation representing companies active in the biotech and life sciences industry  has been a key advisor regarding this initiative.Reyn adds that it’s a major step forward but also a clear request to keep the sector closely involved in the development and assessment of the different solutions. “This plan can only be successful if one is willing to take some tough decisions and prioritise efforts based upon the inherent strength of biotech ecosystems and not on the size of potential customers or voters  but on the true expertise there is today ” he said.Following Biden’s exampleLast year in the United States  President Biden injected $2 billion into the US bioeconomy to boost US manufacturing of US inventions. Meanwhile  two years ago De Croo began developing a Health & Biotech Valley strategy to boost the sector in Belgium during the next five to ten years. Belgium is in now in full rollout of the strategy.Some of the priorities include scaling up innovation with anchored production activities in Belgium and Europe to promote both public and private investments  especially for late-stage activities requiring substantial budgets and streamlining regulations and to focus on the education and upskilling of talent with the necessary skills.Develop talent of the futureAccording to bio.be/essenscia  one of the driving forces behind the Health & Biotech Valley strategy  over the next five years  is the need for around 1 500 new workers in the biotech sector each year. Not only is there a potential numerical shortage of employees  but also  the skills for the future pose a challenge.The country is addressing this with three training centres: ViTalent (Flanders)  aptaskil (Wallonia)  and the EU Biotech Campus (Wallonia). The EU Biotech Campus aims to be operational by 2025  aspiring to become an international training centre shaping the future talents in biotech.Strengthen the financial ecosystemEfforts to strengthen the financial biotech ecosystem  such as consolidating funds and stock markets to create a unified EU biotech-friendly market  offer a promising opportunity to bolster local successes swiftly.However  alongside this consolidation  maintaining a vibrant venture capital (VC) environment is equally critical. Rewarding risk-taking in VC investments is imperative for the growth of the biotech sector.“Suggestions by some Member States to remove these incentives could have detrimental effects  potentially stifling seed and early-stage financing crucial for biotech innovation and development ” warns Reyn. In his view  sustaining a supportive VC environment alongside market consolidation is essential for the continued growth and success of the biotech industry.[By Nicole Verbeek  Edited by Vasiliki Angouridi  Brian Maguire | Euractiv’s Advocacy Lab]Read more with Euractiv,neutral,0.18,0.8,0.02,mixed,0.19,0.35,0.46,True,English,"['EU biotech leadership ambition', 'Advocacy Lab Content', 'biotech valley', 'De Croo', 'Belgium', 'health', 'Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo', 'vibrant venture capital (VC) environment', 'next five to ten years', 'unified EU biotech-friendly market', 'European stock market value', 'The EU Biotech Campus', 'ten Belgian biotech companies', 'next five years', 'supportive VC environment', 'Deputy Secretary General', 'three training centres', 'international training centre', 'strong research clusters', 'potential numerical shortage', 'biotech leadership capability', 'life sciences industry', 'Tineke Van hooland', 'next European Commission', 'Biotech Valley strategy', 'financial biotech ecosystem', 'targeted action plan', 'new biotech initiative', 'European biotech sector', 'Belgian federation', 'VC investments', 'Next step', 'market cap', 'financial ecosystem', 'stock markets', 'Belgian Health', 'The US', 'biotech industry', 'strong position', 'European presence', 'potential customers', '1,500 new workers', 'market consolidation', 'biotech entrepreneur', 'biotech ecosystems', 'fierce competition', 'Euronext Brussels', 'targeted actions', 'absolute forefront', 'leading force', 'bio.be', 'a year', 'key advisor', 'major step', 'clear request', 'different solutions', 'tough decisions', 'inherent strength', 'true expertise', 'United States', 'full rollout', 'private investments', 'late-stage activities', 'substantial budgets', 'driving forces', 'promising opportunity', 'local successes', 'Member States', 'detrimental effects', 'Nicole Verbeek', 'Vasiliki Angouridi', 'Brian Maguire', 'Advocacy Lab', 'biotech innovation', 'US bioeconomy', 'US manufacturing', 'US inventions', 'flanders.bio', 'essential need', 'President Biden', 'production activities', 'necessary skills', 'early-stage financing', 'continued growth', 'Dirk Reyn', 'future talents', 'biotechnology sector', '600 companies', 'Euractiv', 'China', 'vision', 'ambitions', 'example', 'Belgium', 'size', 'imec', 'March', 'series', 'biomanufacturing', 'aspects', 'development', 'reforms', 'plans', 'Chairman', 'essenscia', 'proposals', 'words', 'assessment', 'efforts', 'voters', 'priorities', 'public', 'streamlining', 'regulations', 'education', 'upskilling', 'employees', 'challenge', 'country', 'ViTalent', 'aptaskil', 'Wallonia', 'funds', 'risk-taking', 'Suggestions', 'incentives', 'seed', 'view']",2024-03-26,2024-03-27,euractiv.com

A recent study by the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) reveals a worrying uptick in online piracy within Europe  with a 3.3% increase in 2022 reversing a previous decline from 2017 to 2021. TV content constitutes nearly half of all piracy  while live sports event piracy has also surged due to streaming platforms' popularity. EUIPO's Executive Director emphasizes the necessity of understanding piracy mechanisms to implement effective policies.Counterspy goes beyond traditional methods to ensure top-tier security for media app subscribers  safeguarding content across various devices. It fills the gap in authentication created by the shift from operator-controlled set top box hardware to retail or app-based OTT clients  allowing operators to distribute content confidently while preventing piracy. With Counterspy  each app instance is authenticated and tied to a specific subscriber  ensuring transparency and control over access. By safeguarding the authentication token from theft or manipulation  Counterspy prevents abuse and ensures legitimate access to content  going above and beyond traditional DRM vendors. More information is available at www.verimatrix.com/anti-piracy/counterspy.Operators can schedule a Counterspy demo time in Verimatrix’s suite during the NAB show or visit www.verimatrix.com/anti-piracy/talk-to-us.“In a time where premium content theft is only a prompt away  siphoning video revenues into piracy networks and multiplying CDN costs  Verimatrix’ Counterspy brings back control and visibility to video operators  they were longing for since moving into OTT ” said Andrew Bear  head of anti-piracy business at Verimatrix.Verimatrix’s demo event at this year’s NAB Show comes amid the recent publishing of the company’s latest white paper  “Securing the Streaming Seas ” which showcases Counterspy’s unmatched defenses against video piracy in today’s entertainment ecosystem that is heavily dominated by video apps.

Accor plays an active role in international coalitions that foster the emergence of shared solutions to environmental and social challenges and push to redefine and set new standards f…,"Accor's water stewardship efforts focus on three key areas:Water Quantity & Quality: Accor is committed to (i) reducing water consumption through efficiency and sufficiency measures  and (ii) improving water quality through avoiding chemical-based products in our operations and fighting micro-plastic pollution. Initiatives such as the deployment of Accor's Water Plan to optimize water use in operations  and source sustainable solutions  have already yielded promising results.Accor is committed to (i) reducing water consumption through efficiency and sufficiency measures  and (ii) improving water quality through avoiding chemical-based products in our operations and fighting micro-plastic pollution. Initiatives such as the deployment of Accor's Water Plan to optimize water use in operations  and source sustainable solutions  have already yielded promising results. As an example  Mövenpick Petra converted 90% of hotel rooms from bathtubs to walk-in showers  aiming for a 15% reduction in room water consumption by 2025. This has led to a decrease in water usage from 45 000 m3 in 2019 to 27 000 m3 in 2023.Food & Beverage Value Chain: Recognizing the significant water footprint of the food and beverage sector  Accor is prioritizing initiatives and actions on its food & beverage offers to reduce its water footprint. The first issue to tackle is food waste  given that 53% of the waste generated in a hotel comes from food. Then  strategies include promoting sustainable sourcing practices and offering guests alternative dining experiences that embed sustainability at the core. Moreover  Accor has just signed a strategic partnership with BE WTR  a premium sustainable water brand  to eliminate single-use plastic water bottles from its properties by 2025. Through BE WTR's innovative refillable glass bottling plants  Accor hotels worldwide will offer guests a sustainable hydration solution that aligns with the company's commitment to reducing plastic waste.Recognizing the significant water footprint of the food and beverage sector  Accor is prioritizing initiatives and actions on its food & beverage offers to reduce its water footprint. Guest Engagement: Accor is empowering guests to contribute to water conservation efforts through initiatives such as the ""Skip the Clean"" project  which encourages guests to forgo daily room cleaning to conserve water and energy while earning loyalty points. By fostering awareness and changing behaviors  Accor aims to amplify the impact of its sustainability initiatives. If all multi-night’s guests would opt-out of daily cleaning of their room (except every third day)  it’s estimated that up to 4% of Accor Group direct water consumption could be saved. For an average hotel  it is the equivalent of 6 500 showers that could be saved each year.Accor is empowering guests to contribute to water conservation efforts through initiatives such as the ""Skip the Clean"" project  which encourages guests to forgo daily room cleaning to conserve water and energy while earning loyalty points. By fostering awareness and changing behaviors  Accor aims to amplify the impact of its sustainability initiatives.Foster Collaboration to Amplify Water StewardshipAccor's commitment to water stewardship extends beyond its own operations. Accor plays an active role in international coalitions that foster the emergence of shared solutions to environmental and social challenges and push to redefine and set new standards for the industry.In addition of being part of the Sustainable Hospitality Alliance (SHA) and having launched the ""Hospitality Alliance for Responsible Procurement” – HARP amongst others key leaders  Sébastien Bazin  Accor’s Chairman & CEO  has announced today at Change Now Summit 2024  (the largest event of solutions for the planet) having signed the CEO Water Mandate  an initiative created by the United Nations in 2007 that gathers 256 committed companies on water issues. Joining the coalition  Accor is committed to continual progress along six areas of water stewardship: direct operations  supply chain & watershed  collective action  public policy  community engagement and transparency. Accor will forge partnerships that will strenghten its ability to address urgent water issues listed above. And accelerate collective positive water impact in 100 priority basins by 2030.When at least 50% of the world’s population live under highly water-stressed conditions for at least one month of the year  we cannot operate hotels as we did before. Water is a vital resource that underpins our operations  our value chain and the well-being of the communities we serve. Therefore  Accor is dedicated to pioneering sustainable solutions & experiences that make every stay a contribution to the society and the environment. To do so  we foster collaboration over competition to set new standards and drive water stewardship actions in all territories where we operate.

OPM-101 is currently undergoing a Phase I trial with multiple-dose escalation in healthy volunteers  setting the stage for Phase IIa trials anticipated to commence later in 2024.OPM also reported on OPM-201  a treatment for Parkinson's disease that has been licensed to Servier. This drug candidate is similarly progressing through Phase I trials with healthy volunteers.Despite these developments  Oncodesign registered a net loss of €8.1 million for the year  which aligns with the company's projections and reflects the typical financial structure of a developing biopharmaceutical firm.The company's cash reserves stood at €10 million as of December 31  2023. Subsequently  in February 2024  Oncodesign raised an additional €2 million in funding and received €0.52 million from the DeepTech financing for its ANIMUS program. These financial maneuvers have extended the company's cash visibility beyond 12 months.Oncodesign's CEO Philippe Genne highlighted the entry of two compounds into Phase I clinical trials and the application of artificial intelligence in identifying therapeutic targets. COO Karine Lignel emphasized the company's solid financial visibility  which supports ongoing development programs.The company's revenue for 2023 was €1.1 million  down significantly from the previous year  largely due to the absence of expected up-front or milestone payments from collaboration programs.Looking ahead to 2024  Oncodesign anticipates new revenues and public funding  the progression of OPM-101 through Phase I  and the potential advancement of OPM-102 into preclinical trials.The full annual financial report for 2023 will be available on Oncodesign's website on April 25  2024. The next financial event  the Ordinary General Meeting  is scheduled for June 26  2024.This report is based on a press release statement from Oncodesign Precision Medicine.InvestingPro InsightsOncodesign Precision Medicine's (Euronext Paris: ALOPM) commitment to advancing its R&D initiatives is reflected in the company's recent financial results. While the company is navigating through the costly process of drug development  InvestingPro data provides a snapshot of the company's market performance that may be of interest to investors.The market capitalization of Oncodesign stands at $26.56 million  which  while modest  indicates a level of investor confidence in the company's potential. This is particularly noteworthy given the company's current lack of profitability  as highlighted by one of the InvestingPro Tips  which points out that analysts do not expect Oncodesign to be profitable this year.Investors might also consider the company's stock price movements as a gauge of market sentiment. Over the past week  the stock has seen a price total return of 3.89%  and despite a more turbulent three and six-month performance  with returns of -20.33% and -18.33% respectively  the one-year price total return stands at a positive 26.22%.These fluctuations underscore the volatile nature of investing in biopharmaceutical companies like Oncodesign  which are heavily reliant on successful drug development milestones.Another InvestingPro Tip worth noting is that Oncodesign does not pay a dividend to shareholders  which is typical for companies focused on growth and reinvestment into their R&D programs. This aligns with the company's strategy of prioritizing the advancement of its drug candidates over short-term financial returns to shareholders.For investors seeking more in-depth analysis and additional InvestingPro Tips  there are more insights available on the InvestingPro platform.

The Investment Association generally supports resolutions seeking authority to allot up to 66.66% of a company's issued share capital (excluding treasury shares) of which any allotment in excess of 33.33% of the issued share capital (excluding treasury shares) is applied to allot shares pursuant to a pre-emptive offer.Accordingly  Resolution 6 proposes to authorise the Directors to allot shares up to an aggregate nominal value of €1 494 930 (representing approximately 66.66% of the issued ordinary sharecapital of the Company (excluding treasury shares) as at 5p.m. on 21 March 2024) of which any allotment in excess of 74 746 504 shares (representing 33.33% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company  excluding treasury shares) as at 5 p.m. on 21 March 2024  shall be applied to allot shares pursuant to a pre-emptive offer.The Directors have no current intention of exercising this authority.If adopted  this authority will expire at the conclusion of the next annual general meeting of the Company or at midnight on the date which is 15 months after the passing of the resolution (whichever is earlier) unless previously varied  revoked or renewed.This resolution is a common one atannual general meetings of companies listed on the main markets of Euronext Dublin and/or the London Stock Exchange and is in line with institutional shareholder guidance.Resolutions 7 to 12 of the Notice of AGM are proposed as special resolutions.Resolutions 7 and 8: Disapplication of statutory pre‐ emption rights in certain circumstancesThe Companies Act 2014 sets out pre-emption rights for members where new equity securities (essentially ordinary shares in the case of the Company) are to be allotted for cash. The Companies Act 2014 also provides for these pre- emption rights to be modiϐied or disapplied. The London based Pre- Emption Group has issued guidelines for such modiϐications or disapplications.These guidelines were revised in November 2022 and Resolutions 7 and 8 are in terms consistent with these revised guidelines.Accordingly  Resolution 7 is asking members to renew the Directors' authority to disapply the strict statutory pre- emption provisions in certain circumstances  being: (i) rights issues  open offers or other pre-emptive offers and subject thereto by way of placing or otherwise of any shares not taken up in such issue or offer; and/or (ii) for allotments (other than by way of pre-emptive offers) up to an aggregate nominal value of €224 262 which represents 10% of the total nominal value of the Company's issued share capital (excluding treasury shares) as 5 p.m. on 21 March 2024; and/or (iii) the allotmentof equity securities pursuant to the Company's employee share scheme for the time being in force; and/or (iv) for allotments (other than allotments made pursuant to paragraphs (a)  (b) or (c) of Resolution 7) of up to a nominal amount equal to 20% of any securities issued pursuant to paragraph (b) of Resolution 7 from time to time and made in accordance with paragraph 3 of Part 2B of the Pre-Emption's Group Statement of Principles (the ""Pre-Emption Principles"") which describes the expected features of any follow-on offer. )Resolution 8 is asking members to renew the Directors' authority to disapply the strict statutory pre-emption provisions in additional circumstances  being (a) for allotments (other than by way of pre-emptive offers) up to an additional aggregate nominal value of €224 262 which represents a further 10% of the total nominal value of the Company's issued share capital (excluding treasury shares) as at 5 p.m. on 21 March 2024; and (b) for allotments (other than allotments made pursuant to paragraph (a) of Resolution 8) of up to a nominal amount equal to 20% of any securities issued pursuant to paragraph (a) of Resolution 8 from time to time and made in accordance with paragraph 3 of Part 2B of the Pre-Emption Principles which describes the expected features of any follow-on offer.The Board conϐirms:(a) in relation to Resolution 8(a) that it intends that any use of this authority would be only in connection with an acquisition or speciϐied capital investment within the meaning of the Pre-Emption Principles. For this purpose and reϐlecting the Pre-emption Principles  an acquisition or speciϐied capital investment means one that is announced contemporaneously with the issue of share capital  or that has taken place in the preceding six- month period and is disclosed in the announcement of the issue;(b)in relation to Resolutions 7 and 8generally  that it intends to follow the shareholder protections set out in Part 2B of the Pre-Emption Principles; and(c) in relation to Resolutions 7(d) and 8(b)  that it intends to follow the expected features of a follow-on offer set out in paragraph 3 of Part 2B of Pre- Emption Principles.If adopted  each of these authorities will expire at the conclusion of the nextannual general meeting of the Company or atmidnight on the date which is 15 months after the passing of the resolution (whichever is earlier) unless previously varied  revoked or renewed.These resolutions are common at annual general meetings of companies on the main markets of Euronext Dublin and/or the London Stock Exchange and are in line with institutional shareholder guidance and in particular with the Pre-emption Principles.Resolution 9: Authorisation of market purchases of the Company's shares Resolution 9 is asking members to renew the authority given to the Company (and any of its subsidiaries) to make market purchases and overseas market purchases of its issued shares provided that the maximum number of shares authorised to be acquired shall not exceed10% of the issued share capital of the Company (excluding treasury shares) as at the date of passing of Resolution 9. If adopted  this authority will expire at the conclusion of the next annual general meeting of the Company or at midnight on the date which is 15 months after the passing of the resolution (whichever is earlier) unless previously varied  revoked or renewed.While the Directors do not have any current intention to exercise this power  this authority is being sought in accordance with common practice of companies on the main markets of Euronext Dublin and/or the London Stock Exchange.If used  such purchases would be made only at price levels which the Directors considered to be in the best interests of the members generally  after taking into account the Company's overall ϐinancial position.In addition  the authority being sought from members will provide that the minimum price (excluding expenses) which may be paid for such shares shall be an amount not less than the nominal value of the shares and the maximum price will be the higher of:(a) 5% above the average of the closing prices of the Company's ordinary shares taken from the main market of Euronext Dublin and/or the London Stock Exchange (as the case may be depending on where the purchase is carried out)  in each case for the ϐive business days prior to the day the purchase is made (the ""Market Purchase Appropriate Price"")  or if on any such business day there shall beno dealing of ordinary shares on the trading venue(s) where the purchase is carried out or a closing price is not otherwise available  the Market Purchase Appropriate Price shall be determined by such other method as the Directors shall determine  in their sole discretion  to be fair and reasonable; and(b) the amount stipulated by Article 3(2) of the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016 / 1052 relating to such regulatory technical standards for the conditions applicable to buy-backs and stabilisation (being the value of such an ordinary share calculated on the basis of the higher of the price quoted for: (i) the last independent trade; and (ii) the highest current independent purchase bid for any number of such ordinary shares on the trading venue(s) where the purchase pursuant to the authority conferred by Resolution 9 will be carried out).Resolution 10: Authorisation for the re‐allotment of treasury shares Resolution 10 is asking members to renew the authority to re-allot treasury shares pursuant to Section 1078 of the Companies Act 2014 where the re-allotment price range at which treasury shares may be re-allotted is as follows:(a) the maximum price at which a treasury share may be re- allotted off-market shall be an amount equal to 120% of the Treasury Share Appropriate Price (as deϐined below); and(b) the minimum price at which a treasury share may be re- allotted off-market shall be the nominal value of the share where such share is required to satisfy an obligation under an employee share scheme or in all other cases shall be an amount equal to 95% of the Treasury Share Appropriate Price (provided always that no treasury share shall be re- allotted at a price lower than its nominal value)If adopted  this authority will expire at the conclusion of the next annual generalmeeting of the Company or at midnight on the date which is 15 months after the passing of the resolution (whichever is earlier)  unless previously varied  revoked or renewed. (For the purpose of the resolution  ""Treasury Share Appropriate Price"" means the lower of the average of the closing prices of the Company's ordinary shares taken from the main market of Euronext Dublin and the average of the closing prices of the Company's ordinary shares taken from the main market of the London Stock Exchange in each case for the ϐive business days (in Dublin and in London  respectively  as the case may be) prior to the day the re-allotment is made  or if on any business day there shall be no dealing of ordinary shares on the trading venue or a closing price is not otherwise available  the Treasury Share Appropriate Price shall be determined by such other method as the Directors shall determine  in their sole discretion  to be fair and reasonable).Resolution 11: Notice of General MeetingsResolution 11 allows the Directors to call a general meeting (other than the annual general meeting or a meeting for the passing of a special resolution) on 14 clear days' notice where the purpose of the meeting is solely to consider one or more ordinary resolutions.Section 1102 of the Companies Act 2014 provides that on an annual basis a company may pass a resolution such as this Resolution 11 to preserve its ϐlexibility to call certain extraordinary general meetings  where appropriate  using the shorter notice period (14 clear days).The Company conϐirms that it will only use the shorter notice period where it is in the interests of the members to do so and where the ϐlexibility is merited by the purpose of the meeting. If passed  this authority will be effective until the next annual general meeting of the Company  when it is intended that a similar resolution will be proposed.This Resolution is a common one atannual general meetings of Irish companies on the on the main markets of Euronext Dublin and/or the London Stock Exchange.Resolution 12: Number of Directors Resolution 12 proposes an amendment to Article 74 of the constitution of the Company to increase the maximum number of directors of the Company from ten to twelve. No other changes are proposed to Article 74 or the constitution more generally.While the Board does not currently intend to increase the number of directors on the Board  this increased ϐlexibility is in the best interests of the Company so that from time-to-time additional directors can be appointed to the Board  including where a overlap between new and departing directors may be desirable to facilitate a proper and effective transition.A copy of the updated constitution showing such proposed amendment together with a comparison against the existing constitution of the Company is available and (will be so available until the conclusion of the AGM) on the Company's website (www.dalatahotelgroup.com) and at its registered ofϐice and will also be available at the AGM for least ϐifteen minutes before  and for the duration of  the AGM.RecommendationYour Board of Directors unanimously recommends that you vote in favour of each of the resolutions to be proposed at the AGM.Yours faithfully John HennessyNon-executive ChairNotice of Meeting of Dalata Hotel Group plcNOTICE is hereby given that the annual general meeting of Dalata Hotel Group plc (the Company) will be held at 11.30 a.m. on Thursday 25 April 2024 at Clayton Hotel Cardiff Lane  Sir John Rogerson's Quay  Dublin Docklands  Dublin  D02 YT21  for the following purposes:To consider and  if thought ϐit  to pass the following resolutions as ordinary resolutions:1.

CARBIOS is the first recycling technology supplier to join  demonstrating the importance given to recycling to achieve textile circularity. By contributing its revolutionary solution for the biorecycling of polyester  the world's most widely used and fastest-growing textile fiber  CARBIOS aims to contribute Paris Good Fashion’s mission  which focuses on concrete actions  best practice sharing and collective intelligence to accelerate change in the fashion industry.Developing the ""fiber-to-fiber"" industryCARBIOS will be particularly involved in the association's project to set up a working group dedicated to the development of a ""fiber-to-fiber"" industry  one of Paris Good Fashion's top priorities over the next five years. While only 1% of textiles are currently recycled fiber-to-fiber (circular)  this working group will identify levers for significantly increasing the share of recycled fibers in the industry. By way of example  polyester currently follows a linear model from which we need to break out: virgin polyester is made from petroleum  and recycled polyester from PET bottles. After use  most of these products end their lives in landfill or incineration. A circular  ""fiber-to-fiber"" industry will give new life to textiles and reduce the environmental impact associated to their end-of-life management.Bénédicte GARBIL  Senior Vice-President of Corporate Affairs and Sustainability: “Becoming a member of Paris Good Fashion is an important step in CARBIOS’ development  and an obvious one given our shared commitment to a circular textile industry. By uniting around textile circularity  CARBIOS and Paris Good Fashion’s members will further develop the ""fiber-to-fiber"" industry  a French industry that can be a driving force for change on the international stage for exemplary sustainable fashion.”Isabelle Lefort  co-founder Paris Good Fashion: “The future of circular fashion will inevitably involve the development of an efficient Fiber-to-Fiber industry in Europe.

These consolidated financial statements have been audited by the Statutory Auditors  whose report is currently being prepared.Audited consolidated financial statements (report being prepared)in €m Dec 31  2023 Déc 31  2022 Change Revenue 327.6 338.7 -3.3% Adjusted EBIT1 11.3 26.5 -57.5% Operating Income 12.6 25.1 -50.0% Net Income  Group Share 4.7 15.5 -69.6%Sébastien Baril  SergeFerrari Group’s Chairman of the Executive Board  stated:” Although the adverse environment in its historic businesses led to a drop in volumes and profitability  SergeFerrari Group continued to develop its Solutions activities by extending its geographical coverage in 2023. This development ambition must  however  be coupled with an adjustment in the allocation of resources and production facilities to market conditions and trends. The Group is exposed to ever-shortening economic cycles. Faced with this reality and driven by the aim of returning to profitability in line with its standards  the Group is reconsidering its organization as part of the TRANSFORM 2025 plan. The plan sets out our strategic direction  while detailing the operational and financial roadmap that supports it  with the objective of creating greater value for the Group as a whole.”2023 Revenues and profitabilityRevenues (in €m) 2023 2022 Change at current scopeand currency Change at constantscope and currency 1st quarter 84.8 79.0 +7.3% +0.2% 2nd quarter 90.7 91.0 -0.3% -5.6% 3rd quarter 73.0 79.7 -8.3% -12.8% 4th quarter 79.1 89.0 -11.2% -10.8% Full Year Total 327.6 338.7 -3.3% -6.8%The Group reported revenues of €327.6 million in 2023  down -3.3% on a current scope and exchange rate basis and -6.8% on a constant scope and exchange rate basis  impacted by the contraction of its historical markets in Europe. The downturn is more pronounced in innovative materials (around 73% of sales)  with sales volumes down by 12% compared with 2022. This situation is partially offset by the growth dynamic observed in the SOLUTIONS activities  with strong organic growth and the impact of acquisitions made during the period  namely Markleen and BSI. By the end of December 2023  SOLUTIONS activities represented 12% of the Group's consolidated sales  or over €40 million.Audited consolidated financial statements (report being prepared)in €m Dec 31  2023 Déc 31  2022 Change Revenue 327.6 338.7 -3.3% Adjusted EBIT2 11.3 26.5 -57.5% Operating Income 12.6 25.1 -50.0% Net Income  Group Share 4.7 15.5 -69.6%The decline in the margin rate on purchases consumed over the period  from 52.3% of revenues in 2022 to 50.6% in 2023  is explained by the combination of a negative volume effect on sales and rising energy costs. The sharp reduction in volumes produced in 2023 has enabled the Group to achieve the inventory reduction targets but has contributed to the recognition of an under-activity charge.The Group's adjusted EBIT therefore came to €11.3 million  compared with €26.5 million the previous year. In conclusion  SergeFerrari Group recorded operating income of €12.6 million  compared with €25.1 million in 2022  and net income  Group share  of €4.7 million  compared with €15.5 million in 2022.Financial Structurein €m Dec 31  2023 Dec 31  2022 Net debt 128.2 85.3 Net debt excl. IFRS 16 78.6 61.2 Shareholders' equity  Group share 118.5 120.0The operating working capital requirement (WCR) follows the trajectory of the €8.5 million reduction in inventories recorded in 2023  decreasing to €130.1 million and representing 39.7% of revenues in 2023 compared with €135.8 million and 40.0% of revenues in 2022. This decline is also the result of a 6.1% decrease in trade receivables.In addition  the Group pursued its external growth policy aimed at consolidating its position in SOLUTIONS activities  through the acquisition of a 64% stake in Markleen Management SL in Spain and the acquisition of a 60% stake in BSI in India.Net debt used to calculate covenants thus came to €78.6 million  representing around 61% of Group shareholders' equity. The Group is in compliance with its banking covenants  the leverage ratio having been waived on December 31  2023.Outlook 2024Since the end of 2023  SergeFerrari Group has been working to ensure that its organizational structure can more easily absorb the business cycles observed in its historical markets  through the deployment of its TRANSFORM 2025 plan. The first effects of this program were already felt in the 4th quarter of 2023  notably the management of working capital through supply chain optimization. These measures were enhanced by using part-time working in the 1st quarter 2024.TRANSFORM 2025 planGiven the increasingly cyclical nature of business in its main markets  the Group intends to adapt its cost structure in line with its TRANSFORM 2025 plan launched at the end of 2023.This plan aims to increase profitability and optimize the allocation of resources through a number of levers:Industrial reorganization in line with the current production perimeter  avoiding duplication of jobs by geographical area;Preservation of strategic investments and limitation of capacity investments;Optimization and adaptation of the organizational structure to the seasonality observed in historical markets  with the aim of achieving a WCR representing 35% of revenues by 2025;Deployment of synergies from recent acquisitions and strengthen the penetration of Solutions activities in new geographies;Securing the Group's competitive advantages by maintaining the momentum of R&D investment  ensuring the renewal of the product portfolio.DividendAt the Annual General Meeting of May 16th  2024  the Group will propose a dividend of €0.12 per share for fiscal year 2023  payable in July 2024.GovernancePhilippe Brun  member of the SergeFerrari Group Executive Board  has retired and will step down from his operational functions on March 31st  2024. Philippe Brun will continue to support the majority shareholder in its strategic considerations.Sébastien Ferrari  Chairman of the Supervisory Board of SergeFerrari Group  comments: ""I would like to thank Philippe Brun for his commitment during his fourteen years within the Group and will be delighted to continue to benefit from his support within the Ferrari Participations family holding company. During this period  the Group's revenues more than doubled to €327 million in 2023  thanks in particular to some fifteen external growth operations.”Financial calendar- Publication of 2023 Q1 revenues  on Tuesday  April 23rd  2024  after market close- Annual General Meeting: Thursday 16th  2024  at 10:00 amABOUT SERGEFERRARI GROUPThe Serge Ferrari Group is a leading global supplier of composite materials for Tensile Architecture  Modular Structures  Solar Protection and Furniture/Marine  in a global market estimated by the Company at around €6 billion.

This remuneration policy was adopted by the General Meeting on May 16  2022 (the ""Existing Remuneration Policy"").In accordance with section 2:135a (2) in conjunction with 2:145 (2) of the Dutch Civil Code it is proposed by the Supervisory Board  following a recommendation by its Nomination  Selection and Remuneration Committee (the ""NSR"")  to adopt a new remuneration policy for the members of the Supervisory Board (the ""Remuneration Policy Supervisory Board""). The NSR has entered into dialogues with stakeholders as part of the preparation of the Remuneration Policy Supervisory Board.The purpose of the Remuneration Policy Supervisory Board is to provide compensation that:• aligns with the enlarged scope of ASM;• motivates and rewards Supervisory Board members with a balanced compensation  in sync with role and responsibilities;• allows ASM to attract  reward and retain highly qualified  independent  and high-caliber members of the Supervisory Board with the required background  experience and a broad skillset; and• aligns with comparable peer companies.The main proposed changes to the Existing Remuneration Policy include the following:- the removal of the cap on the travel allowances;- the introduction of a fee per additional meeting in excess of two hours above the regular cadence of the Supervisory Board or its committees in special business circumstances after prior approval by the Chair of the Supervisory Board; and- the introduction of a Technology committee and the option to establish additional committees.Moreover  the Remuneration Policy Supervisory Board shows the increased fees as proposed by the Supervisory Board in agenda item5b.If adopted by the General Meeting  the Remuneration Policy Supervisory Board will take effect retroactively from January 1  2024  and will replace the Existing Remuneration Policy. It is intended that the Remuneration Policy Supervisory Board will be applicable for four years onwards. Material changes to the Remuneration Policy Supervisory Board during this four-year period will be presented to the General Meeting for adoption.The proposed Remuneration Policy Supervisory Board can be found on ASM's websitewww.asm.com  which forms part of this agenda and explanatory notes.Agenda Item5bProposal to amend the remuneration of the members of the Supervisory Board and its committeesThe NSR has prepared  with the assistance of a third party  a comparability study of the compensation levels for the members of the Supervisory Board based on a combination of Dutch general market companies and international sector-specific companies. Starting point was the ASM Management Board Remuneration peer group as contained in the Remuneration Policy Management Board. The selection of the companies included in the market reference group is based on comparability to ASM in terms of: governance structure (two-tier system)  size and scope.The NSR concluded that the current remuneration of ASM's Supervisory Board is at or below the lowest 25th percentile of the AEX peer group and even lower compared to the Management Board remuneration peer group.Following a recommendation by the NSR and dialogues with stakeholders  the Supervisory Board proposes to make certain changes to the remuneration payable to the members of the Supervisory Board  with retrospective effect from January 1  2024. As explained in the rationale for amending the Existing Remuneration Policy under agenda item5a  theSupervisory Board proposes to the General Meeting to determine the various elements of the Supervisory Board remuneration payable in a financial year of ASM as follows:Position Current fee Proposed fee Supervisory Board Chair Supervisory Board EUR 97 500 EUR 130 000 Member Supervisory Board EUR 66 000 EUR 80 000 Audit Committee Chair Audit Committee EUR 15 000 EUR 25 000 Member Audit Committee EUR 10 000 EUR 18 000 Nomination  Selection and Remuneration Committee (""NSR"") Chair NSR EUR 11 000 EUR 22 000 Member NSR EUR 7 400 EUR 15 000 Technology Committee Chair Technology Committee n.a. EUR 22 000 Member Technology Committee n.a. EUR 15 000 Other committees Chair other committee n.a. EUR 22 000 Member other committee n.a. EUR 15 000At the date of the convocation  the Supervisory Board has two committees in place: the Audit Committee and the NSR. As announced in ASM's press release of February 27  2024  the Supervisory Board intends to establish a new Technology Committee which would be chaired by Martin van den Brink subject to his appointment under agenda item6c. Although there are no immediate plans and as the Remuneration Policy Supervisory Board will in principle apply for the next four years  the Remuneration Policy Supervisory Board allows for remuneration to be awarded to potential other committees in the future. In this agenda item 5b it is proposed to establish the remuneration of the chair and members of the Technology Committee and potential other committees.It is proposed that actual and reasonable travel expenses of the members of the Supervisory Board are reimbursed together with a gross travel allowance of €2 500 for continental travels and €5 000 for intercontinental travels if operated for physical attendance at meetings. These amounts are the same as in the Existing Remuneration Policy  but it is proposed to remove the cap included in the Existing Remuneration Policy.Moreover  it is proposed to give Supervisory Board members a gross compensation of €2 500 for additional meetings lasting more than two hours in excess of the regular Supervisory Board and committee meetings cadence in case of special business circumstances  provided that the Chair of the Supervisory Board's prior approval has been obtained.All amounts are gross amounts.If this agenda item is not adopted  the current fees payable to the Supervisory Board members will remain applicable.Agenda item6Composition of the Supervisory BoardThis consists of three items.As announced in ASM's press release of February 16  2023  Ms. de Virgiliis has decided not to seek a second term as Supervisory Board member given her current and future commitments.

My sincere thanks to all of those who contributed to today’s milestone approval in Japan – it takes true collaboration to bring real innovation for the millions of patients around the world living with rare autoimmune disease. And our work has only just begun.”“ITP is a severe  debilitating autoimmune disease  and ITP patients typically experience a significantly lower quality of life ” said Luc Truyen  M.D.  Ph.D.  Chief Medical Officer of argenx. “Physicians now treat ITP via a trial-and-error approach – or by cycling through current therapies. By reducing circulating autoantibodies  VYVGART is uniquely designed to serve as a precision intervention that targets the underlying disease biology of ITP. We are grateful to all of those who contributed to advancing our understanding of the disease so that we could bring VYVGART to patients in Japan.”The approval of VYVGART is based on results from the global Phase 3 ADVANCE-IV trial  which were published in the September 2023 issue of The Lancet. ADVANCE successfully met its primary endpoint  demonstrating that a higher proportion of chronic ITP patients receiving VYVGART achieved a sustained platelet count response compared to placebo. VYVGART demonstrated rapid onset of effect in chronic and persistent ITP patients  as well as a 51% response rate on the International Working Group (IWG) score  which is a measure developed by the world’s leading experts on ITP and highly relevant to clinical care. Primary endpoint responders were observed across patient types regardless of age  disease severity  time since diagnosis  prior ITP treatment or background medication. VYVGART was well-tolerated in this 24-week study and the observed safety and tolerability profile was consistent with previous clinical trials.Phase 3 ADVANCE TrialThe ADVANCE trial enrolled 131 adult patients with chronic and persistent ITP. Patients were heavily pretreated and 67% of patients had received three or more prior ITP therapies  including 59% who had prior thrombopoietin receptor agonist (TPO-RAs) experience  34% with prior rituximab experience and 37% with a history of splenectomy. Patients were insufficiently controlled at baseline with mean platelet counts of 17x109/L across all patients. Of patients who completed the full ADVANCE study  94% (63/67) of VYVGART-treated patients and 97% (38/39) of placebo patients continued to the ADVANCE+ open-label extension study.See the full Prescribing Information for VYVGART in the U.S.  which includes the below Important Safety Information.

VYVGART demonstrated rapid onset of effect in chronic and persistent ITP patients  as well as a 51% response rate on the International Working Group (IWG) score  which is a measure developed by the world’s leading experts on ITP and highly relevant to clinical care. Primary endpoint responders were observed across patient types regardless of age  disease severity  time since diagnosis  prior ITP treatment or background medication. VYVGART was well-tolerated in this 24-week study and the observed safety and tolerability profile was consistent with previous clinical trials.Phase 3 ADVANCE TrialThe ADVANCE trial enrolled 131 adult patients with chronic and persistent ITP. Patients were heavily pretreated and 67% of patients had received three or more prior ITP therapies  including 59% who had prior thrombopoietin receptor agonist (TPO-RAs) experience  34% with prior rituximab experience and 37% with a history of splenectomy. Patients were insufficiently controlled at baseline with mean platelet counts of 17x109/L across all patients. Of patients who completed the full ADVANCE study  94% (63/67) of VYVGART-treated patients and 97% (38/39) of placebo patients continued to the ADVANCE+ open-label extension study.See the full Prescribing Information for VYVGART in the U.S.  which includes the below Important Safety Information.

In severe cases  frequent bleeding events can cause anemia or even brain hemorrhage in rare cases. ITP is also associated with debilitating fatigue and significant impacts on mental health  including anxiety  fear and depression. Many ITP patients are inadequately controlled on current therapies so there remains a significant unmet need for additional treatment options.About VYVGART® (efgartigimod alfa-fcab)VYVGART is a human IgG1 antibody fragment that binds to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)  resulting in the reduction of circulating IgG autoantibodies. It is the first approved FcRn blocker in the United States  EU and China for the treatment of adults with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) who are anti- acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive and in Japan for the treatment of adults with gMG who do not have sufficient response to steroids or non-steroidal immunosuppressive therapies (ISTs). VYVGART is being studied in adults with primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and other IgG autoantibody-mediated diseases. VYVGART has been approved for adults with ITP only in Japan at this time.About argenxargenx is a global immunology company committed to improving the lives of people suffering from severe autoimmune diseases.

There are currently no preventive vaccines or effective treatments available against ZIKV. As such  this mosquito-borne disease remains a public health threat and is included in the Food and Drug Administration’s Tropical Disease Priority Review Voucher Program1.The randomized  placebo-controlled  Phase 1 trial  VLA1601-102  is planned to enroll approximately 150 participants aged 18 to 49 years in the United States. Participants will receive a low  medium or high dose of VLA1601. In addition  the low dose of VLA1601 will be evaluated with an additional adjuvant  either the CpG 1018® adjuvant from Dynavax Technologies Corporation or 3M-052-AF adjuvant from the Access to Advanced Health Institute (AAHI). Topline data from the trial are expected in the first half of 2025.VLA1601 is being developed on the original manufacturing platform of Valneva’s licensed Japanese encephalitis (JE) vaccine IXIARO®  which was further optimized to develop the Company’s inactivated  adjuvanted COVID-19 vaccine VLA2001  the first COVID-19 vaccine to receive a standard marketing authorization in Europe. Phase 1 results from Valneva’s first-generation Zika vaccine candidate were reported in 2018 showing a favorable safety profile and immunogenicity in all tested doses and schedules2.Juan Carlos Jaramillo M.D.  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  said  “Valneva’s commitment to our vision – to live in a world in which no one dies or suffers from a vaccine-preventable disease – fuels our pursuit for preparedness solutions against the Zika virus. As global temperatures rise and rainfall increases  the habitat for disease-carrying mosquitoes expands  presenting an ongoing public health challenge.”A vaccine against ZIKV would nicely complement Valneva’s portfolio of travel vaccines against mosquito-borne diseases. The Company received U.S. approval for its chikungunya vaccine IXCHIQ®  the world first and only chikungunya vaccine to address this unmet medical need  in November 2023  and has been commercializing its JE vaccine IXIARO®  for over ten years. Some health authorities and scientific leaders in the field have indicated a preference for a purified inactivated vaccine method compared to other vaccine technologies. This preference stems from the understanding that the primary recipients of a Zika vaccine are anticipated to be women of childbearing age  potentially including those who are pregnant.About the Zika VirusThe Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus that was first discovered in 1947. The first human cases were detected in 1952. Since then  disease outbreaks have been reported in tropical Africa  Southeast Asia  the Pacific Islands  and  in 2015  in the Americas. Zika virus is currently circulating in Mexico  Central and South America  many countries and territories in the Caribbean region  and in a small number of geographically limited areas of the continental United States. To date  a total of 89 countries and territories have reported evidence of mosquito transmitted Zika virus infection; however  surveillance remains limited globally.According to the World Health Organization  there is scientific consensus that ZIKV is a cause of microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome. Since 2013  31 countries and territories have reported cases of microcephaly and other central nervous system malformations associated with ZIKV infection.About VLA1601VLA1601 is a highly purified inactivated vaccine candidate against the Zika virus (ZIKV)  developed on the original manufacturing platform of Valneva’s licensed Japanese encephalitis vaccine IXIARO®  which was further optimized to develop the Company’s inactivated  adjuvanted COVID-19 vaccine VLA2001  the first COVID-19 vaccine to receive a standard marketing authorization in Europe. Valneva reported positive Phase 1 results for VLA1601 in 20183. The vaccine candidate was immunogenic and showed a favorable safety profile in all tested doses and schedules that was comparable to IXIARO® and other clinical stage ZIKV vaccines.About IXIARO®/JESPECT®Valneva’s Japanese encephalitis vaccine is indicated for active immunization for the prevention of the disease for people who travel to  or live in  endemic areas. It received marketing approval in the U.S.  Europe  Canada  Hong Kong  Singapore  and Israel under the trade name IXIARO® and in Australia and New Zealand where it is marketed as JESPECT®. It is the only vaccine available to the U.S. military for Japanese Encephalitis. IXIARO® is approved for use in individuals two months of age and older in the U.S. and EU member states  Canada  Norway  Liechtenstein  Iceland  Singapore  Hong Kong  Japan  the Republic of Korea and Israel. In all other licensed territories  IXIARO®/JESPECT® is indicated for use in persons aged 18 years or more.About IXCHIQ®In the U.S.  IXCHIQ® is a live-attenuated vaccine indicated for the prevention of disease caused by chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in individuals 18 years of age and older who are at increased risk of exposure to CHIKV. As for all products approved under FDA’s accelerated approval pathway  continued approval for this indication is contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory studies.Pleaseclick here for full Prescribing Information for IXCHIQ®.About Valneva SEWe are a specialty vaccine company that develops  manufactures  and commercializes prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases addressing unmet medical needs.

Supra Bazar is a Belgian family-owned business that has grown to become a major local retail player in the non-food segment. The company has extensive relevant experience in the baby sector with its Supra Bazar stores and the recently acquired Kabine family concept stores.Colruyt Group believes that Dreambaby will have a healthy and sustainable future under the banner of Supra Bazar  and will be fully able to implement its renewed strategy as Belgium's national baby specialist store  with a focus on young families.Dreambaby: Belgium's national baby specialistDreambaby  Colruyt Group's baby specialist  has been fine-tuning its strategy over the past year and has been particularly focusing on this in recent months. As the Belgian market leader  Dreambaby aims to be Belgium's specialist baby store  and a clear decision has been made to excel in this niche market. The focus is on the perspectives and experiences of pregnant women and families with babies up to two years. The brand has opted for an omnichannel experience  with the customer right at the centre. Dreambaby aims to empower future parents so that they and their baby can get off to a great start as a new family.Dreambaby also has its private label: 'dreambee'. This high-quality collection has been developed by a passionate in-house team in Belgium for a decade now. Having this private label also gives Dreambaby a competitive advantage in the baby sector.Dreambaby achieved a revenue of approximately EUR 60 million in the 2022/23 financial year with its 32 stores that were operating at the time. Dreambaby now has 27 stores and 256 employees.Supra Bazar and Kabine: Belgian local retail players with experience in the baby sectorSupra Bazar is a Belgian family-owned business that has grown to become a major local retail player in the non-food segment. It has four stores in West Flanders and one in East Flanders  with a sales area of 11.000 m²  allowing customers to find everything under the same roof in different price categories: from home decoration to DIY  and from gardening and pet supplies to a huge toy department. Supra Bazar also provides a baby gift registry service.At the end of 2023  Supra Bazar also acquired Kabine  which owns two high-end family concept stores on the coast.Supra Bazar not only has in-depth  long-standing knowledge of the non-food retail and baby sector  but it also has a proven track record of running a retail network profitably and of successfully implementing an omnichannel approach.A healthy and sustainable future for DreambabyFor several months  Dreambaby has been working on a more flexible SME structure to make it more agile in a challenging and rapidly changing market. Supra Bazar has many years of experience encompassing the non-food market  the baby sector and an omnichannel approach. This makes it the ideal partner to continue providing flexible  dedicated support to Dreambaby  building on its new momentum and giving the business a healthy and sustainable future. The existing Dreambaby management will remain on board. Dreambaby can thus continue to push towards its strategy of remaining Belgium's number one baby specialist while also taking on new opportunities. In this strategy  Dreambaby will continue to exist  as a brand  as a legal entity and as an employer. Nothing will change for Dreambaby customers: the stores and their employees will remain in place and all its baby gift registries will be maintained.Like Colruyt Group  Supra Bazar believes it is important to play a role at every stage and at key moments in its customers' lives. Dreambaby is a great opportunity for Supra Bazar to continue to fulfil that role  to operate on a national level and to play a significant part in the lives of young families. Dreambaby's stores and product range match Supra Bazar's overall approach and will complement its existing operations.Stefan Goethaert  CEO of Colruyt Group  explains: ""Dreambaby has already taken some very positive steps in the past year. We believe the efforts already made will lead to even greater successes alongside the management of Supra Bazar. The past year has been especially challenging for all Dreambaby employees  and this news will be difficult at first. It is always difficult to say goodbye to 256 hard-working colleagues. At the same time  we are convinced that this is the best solution for the employees and also for the brand's future.""Bavo Vanhalst  CEO of Supra Bazar  adds: ""We are very much looking forward to welcoming Dreambaby's employees  and its customers too. This is the perfect opportunity for us to take a big step nationally in the baby market  which we see as highly attractive and indeed essential for us. The customers will of course continue to benefit from the excellent support they have come to expect from Dreambaby.""The transactionColruyt Group and Supra Bazar's management have reached an agreement for the acquisition of 100% of Dreambaby's shares  so that Supra Bazar gains control of Dreambaby.The transaction is subject to approval by the Belgian Competition Authority. It is intended that the transaction will be finalised by the summer.The parties have both agreed not to disclose any details regarding the agreement.In the annual figures for the 2023/24 financial year  Dreambaby's result will be presented as a 'result from discontinued operations'. Dreambaby's estimated result for the 2023/24 financial year is a loss of no more than EUR 20 million  comprising the operating loss and a number of one-off effects such as impairment losses and the expected impact of this transaction. Some of these one-off effects have already been accounted for in the first half of the 2023/24 financial year.Upon completion of the transaction  Dreambaby will no longer be fully consolidated in the consolidated figures for Colruyt Group.Colruyt Group will  as the case may be  communicate on further developments in accordance with the applicable regulations.Contact detailsFor questions about this press release or for further information  please contact: Journalists: Silja Decock and Hanne Poppe (Press Officers) Tel. +32 473 92 45 10 Email:press@colruytgroup.com Interviews with CEO Stefan Goethaert about this news are possible today (26/03/2024) from 10 am.

In the event of a discrepancy  the Spanish-language version prevails)To the shareholders of Jungle21  S.A.OpinionWe have audited the consolidated annual accounts of Jungle21  S.A. (the Parent company) and its subsidiaries  (the Group)  which comprise the consolidated balance sheet at 31 December 2023  the consolidated income statement  the consolidated statement of changes in equity  the consolidated statement of cash flows and the notes to the consolidated annual accounts for the year then ended.In our opinion  the accompanying consolidated annual accounts present  in all material respects  a true and fair view of the consolidated equity and the consolidated financial position of the Group at 31December 2023  and of the consolidated results of its operations and consolidated cash flows for the year then ended  in accordance with the applicable framework of financial reporting standards (which is identified in note 2a to the consolidated annual accounts) and  in particular  in compliance with the accounting principles and criteria contained in that framework.Basis for opinionWe conducted our audit in accordance with the current Spanish standards for auditing accounts. Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditor´s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated annual accounts section of our report.We are independent of the Group in accordance with the ethical requirements  including those relating to independence  that are applicable to our audit of the consolidated annual accounts in Spain  as required by the regulations governing the auditing of accounts. In this regard  we have not provided any services different to the audit of accounts and no situations or circumstances have arisen that  based on the aforementioned regulations  might have affected the required independence in such a way that it could have been compromised.We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.Most relevant audit aspectsThe most relevant audit aspects of the audit are those that  in our professional judgement  were considered as the most significant material misstatement risks in our audit of the consolidated annual accounts of the current period. These risks were addressed in the context of our audit of the consolidated annual accounts as a whole  and in forming our opinion thereon  and we do not provide a separate opinion on these risks.Miembro de Grant Thornton International LtdBarcelona · Bilbao · Castellón · Madrid · Murcia · Oviedo · Pamplona · Valencia · Zaragoza · Las PalmasGrant Thornton  S.L.P.  Sociedad Unipersonal  Paseo de la Castellana  81  11ª - 28046 Madrid  CIF B-08914830  inscrita en el RM de Madrid  T. 36.652  F. 159  H. M-657.409  inscripción 36ª y en el ROAC nº S0231Revenue recognitionAs mentioned in note 1  the Group derives its revenues mainly from advertising activities. In accordance with the applicable financial reporting framework and as disclosed in note 3.p to the consolidated financial statements  the total transaction price of a contract is allocated to the various performance obligations on the basis of their relative stand-alone selling prices. The transaction price of a contract excludes any amounts collected on behalf of third parties. Revenue is recognised over time when (or as) the Group satisfies the performance obligations by transferring the promised services to its customers. Given the significant nature of the timing of revenue recognition  we consider this to be the most significant risk of material misstatement in relation to revenue.Our key audit procedures at year-end 2023 included  among other things  obtaining an understanding of management's established revenue recognition policies and procedures  substantive testing of the revenue recognition process by obtaining external confirmations for a sample of outstanding customers and performing  where appropriate  alternative verification procedures using subsequent proof of collection or supporting sales documentation. In addition  based on a sample of invoices close to both year-end and the beginning of the following year  we have verified the correct recognition of the revenue in the appropriate period. Finally  we have assessed whether the information disclosed in the consolidated financial statements complies with the requirements of the applicable financial reporting framework.Subsequent valuation of goodwill in consolidationAs stated in note 5 to the accompanying consolidated annual accounts  the Group has recognised under ""Goodwill on Consolidation"" in the consolidated balance sheet an amount of Euros 2.107 thousand relating to the positive differences arising between the carrying amount of the investment and the value attributed to this investment of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed of certain companies acquired by the Parent Company and included in the consolidation. The estimate of the recoverable amount of these assets requires the exercise of judgement by the directors of the parent company  which has been based on a valuation performed by the management of the parent company using valuation techniques  the calculation of which also requires the application of judgement. Because of the inherent uncertainty in these estimates  we consider this matter to be one of the most significant aspects of the audit.Our audit procedures included  among other things  an understanding of the process followed by the Group to obtain the information on which the recoverable amount was based  an assessment of the impairment indicators and the methodology and assumptions used in estimating the recoverable amount  comparing the information contained in the business plans with the Group's own known historical experience. We have also assessed  involving our valuation specialists where necessary  the reasonableness of the valuation model and of the main assumptions and data used in the estimation of recoverable amount. In addition  we have assessed whether the information disclosed in the consolidated financial statements is adequate in relation to the requirements of the applicable financial reporting framework.Other information: Consolidated directors' reportThe other information comprises only the consolidated management report for the 2023 financial year  the preparation of which is the responsibility of the Parent Company's directors and does not form an integral part of the consolidated financial statements.Our audit opinion on the consolidated financial statements does not cover the consolidated management report. Our responsibility for the consolidated management report  as required by the regulations governing the audit activity  is to evaluate and report on the consistency of the consolidated management report with the consolidated financial statements  based on our knowledge of the entity obtained from the audit of those financial statements  and to evaluate and report on whether the content and presentation of the management report are in accordance with the applicable regulations. If  based on the work we have performed  we conclude that there are material misstatements  we are required to report them.Based on the work performed  as described in the preceding paragraph  the information contained in the consolidated management report is consistent with that in the consolidated financial statements for the year 2023 and its content and presentation are in accordance with the applicable standards.Responsibility of the directors of the Parent company for the consolidated annual accountsThe directors of the Parent company are responsible for the preparation of the accompanying consolidated annual accounts  so that they show a true and fair view of the consolidated equity  the consolidated financial position and the consolidated results of the Group  in accordance with the framework of financial reporting standards applicable to the Group in Spain and for such internal control that they consider necessary to enable the preparation of consolidated annual accounts that are free from material misstatements  whether due to fraud or error.In preparing the consolidated annual accounts  the directors of the Parent company are responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a going concern  disclosing  as applicable  matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless the directors of the Parent company either intend to liquidate the Group or to cease operations  or has no realistic alternative but to do so.Auditor´s responsibilities for the audit of the consolidated annual accountsOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated annual accounts as a whole are free from material misstatement  whether due to fraud or error  and to issue an auditor's report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance  but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the current Spanish regulations for auditing accounts will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if  individually or in the aggregate  they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated annual accounts.As part of an audit in accordance with current Spanish regulations for auditing accounts  we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:• Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement in the consolidated annual accounts  whether due to fraud or error  design and perform audit procedures to respond to those risks and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error  as fraud may involve collusion  forgery  intentional omissions  misrepresentations  or the override of internal control.• Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances  but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internal control.• Evaluate the appropriateness of the accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by the directors of the Parent company.• Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors of the Parent company's use of the going concern basis of accounting and  based on the audit evidence obtained  whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists  we are required to draw attention to this in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated annual accounts or  if such disclosures are inadequate  to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However  future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.• Evaluate the overall presentation  structure and content of the consolidated annual accounts  including the disclosures  and whether the consolidated accounts represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves a true and fair view.• Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated annual accounts. We are responsible for the direction  supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.We communicate with the directors of the Parent company regarding  among other matters  the planned scope and timing of the audit and the significant audit findings  including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.From the significant risks communicated to the directors of the Parent company  we determine those risks that were of most significance in the audit of the consolidated annual accounts of the current period and are  therefore  the risks considered most significant.We describe these risks in our auditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter.Consolidated Management Report1. Evolution of the business and position of the company Financial year 2023 closes with a total revenue of €24.7 million  of which €18.1 million corresponds to the Gross Margin  the measure used by the company as a reference for its management. Gross Margin is calculated by deducting the cost of sales for third party expenses from total revenues. The pre-tax profit was €3.3 million  and the after-tax profit was €2.4 million. In general terms  2023 has been a year of consolidation  growth in several key areas and preparation for the future. Turnover has increased by 52% compared to 2022  and the consolidated EBITDA has increased significantly (132%) due to the Group's expense control policies. Our organic growth in Gross Margin has reached 61%  due to the Group's continued focus on recurring customers  which has been a constant priority over the years and the sustainable increase generated by the incorporation of new clients and projects. Creativity still represents our most valuable asset. In this regard  2023 has been an excellent year for the Jungle Group  consolidating PS21 as a leading brand in Spain  and obtaining the Best Agency award from Eficacia Awards for the second consecutive year. These awards - possibly the most relevant in our industry from an advertiser and brand standpoint - show that well-applied creativity has the ability to generate value  business opportunities and sustainable growth for companies. In addition  with these same awards  MeMe won third place in the Best Agency category  being 2023 the first year in which it competes. In September 2023  JUNGLE opened new offices in Barcelona's @22 technology district. This expansion provides us with the opportunity to strengthen our presence in Catalonia and promote collaboration and synergies among the teams of our different companies there. These new facilities will allow us to be closer to our clients in the region and will contribute to our continued development and success in the Catalan market. In relation to our ESG strategy  in 2023 we continue being certified as a B-Corp company. This certification ensures that the Group is part of a global community of business leaders who drive business forward as a positive force for the common good. This achievement reflects the Jungle Group's strong commitment to sustainability  corporate responsibility and creating a positive impact on all aspects of our operation.2. Results and evolution of the companyGrowth in 2023 is primarily due to the following factors:a. Consolidation of processes and implementation of commercial strategies employed to increase the financial and operating performance of the companies acquired before the start of 2023 (+61% Gross Margin between 2022 and 2023).b. Consolidation and increased business from long-term clients  by cross-selling products  better identifying opportunities  positioning through competitive differentiation and offering services of higher value perceived by the customer.Operating staff expenses (eliminating board expenses and redundancy payments) have increased +44% in line with our decision to increase employee knowledge and create recruitment processes to attract and retain top talent in key areas. Management believes that those investments will deliver long-term economic benefits by allowing it to better capitalise on market opportunities and distinguish itself from the competition.Overhead operating expenses (eliminating extraordinary expenses) have increased by 41%  due to (i) an increase in the Group's overall operating activity  and (ii) higher inflation rates that have been reflected in the prices of certain suppliers.Considering the operating EBITDA (EBIDTA without taking into account the amount of redundancy payments  extraordinary expenses and variable remunerations)  has grown to €5 292 460 (€2 279 092 in 2022) and net profit has increased to €2 376 495 compared to €253 529 in 2022.The profitability of EBITDA stands at 29% (20% in 2022) and the net result is 13% relative to net income (1% in 2022). In the net result  in addition to what has already been mentioned in the personnel expenses and general expenses that affect the result  it has been influenced by (i) an increase in amortisations for investments in fixed assets and M&As (goodwill amortised over 10 years)  (ii) variation in the fair value of financial instruments and (iii) company tax payable.On a Group level  the ambition is to continue to grow at the set pace and in 2024 continue to incorporate new lines of business for the Group  as well as to see our current clients grow.The following tables show the summary operating account and the calculation of the recurring EBITDA for years 2022 and 2023:BPE 2022 2023 Revenue (net MMFF) 16.136.614 24.717.552 Cost of good sales 4.912.841 6.612.307 Gross margin (net MMFF) 11.223.772 18.105.245 % / Revenue 70% 73% Personal cost 7.380.143 10.613.549 Net margin 3.843.629 7.491.696 General Cost (net MMFF) 1.564.537 2.199.236 Total general  personel+general 8.944.680 12.812.785 EBITDA 2.279.092 5.292.460 % margin 20% 29% Financial results (651.393) (143.576) Extra results (582.849) (1.181.042) PBTA 1.044.850 3.967.841 Amortizations 561.409 711.335 Tax 229.912 880.011 Net profit 253.529 2.376.495 ADJUSTED OPERATING EBITDA Operation Profit and Loss 1.134.834 3.400.083 Amortisation on assets 561.409 711.335 Severance cost 48.830 144.181 Depreciation comercial 213.939 124.890 Tributes 14.591 15.456 Depreciation property  plant and equipment 97 25.351 Regularizations and others (34.849) (54.417) Board expenses 123.314 185.413 Acquisition and set-up related expenses 216.927 740.167 Operating EBITDA 2.279.092 5.292.460 Pro-forma Adjustments 174.603 0 Operating EBITDA (pro-forma) 2.453.695 5.292.460On the other hand  and understanding pro-forma as non-consolidated results prepared as if the Group and the acquired companies had existed in their entirety during the year and prepared in comparable terms without consolidation eliminations  the following tables show the reduced operating account and the calculation of recurrent EBITDA for the years 2022 and 2023  comparing the consolidated results with the pro-forma:",neutral,0.01,0.98,0.01,mixed,0.23,0.29,0.48,True,English,"['JUNGLE 21 S A', 'March', '12:31', 'Mr. Agustín Vivancos CEO', 'relative stand-alone selling prices', 'Grant Thornton International Ltd', 'Las Palmas Grant Thornton', 'accompanying consolidated annual accounts', 'consolidated annual accounts section', 'applicable financial reporting framework', 'subsidiaries Consolidated Annual Accounts', 'consolidated balance sheet', 'consolidated financial position', 'consolidated financial statements', 'individual annual accounts', 'financial reporting standards', 'following financial information', 'consolidated income statement', 'S.L.P.', 'Euronext Rule Book', 'total transaction price', 'consolidated cash flows', 'relevant audit aspects', 'various performance obligations', 'material misstatement risks', 'current Spanish standards', 'I.

These results were approved by the Board of Directors today.The audit procedures on the consolidated financial statements have been completed  and the certification report will be issued once the verification of the management report and the due diligence relating to the electronic ESEF format of the 2023 financial statements have been finalized.Results for the 2023 financial year are in line with targets  despite the difficult economic climate.Sales fell by 25.3% to 2 075 million euros (-23.3% at constant exchange rates).Adjusted EBITDA totaled 142 million euros (-11.7%)  with the margin rising to 6.8% of sales from 5.8% in 2022.Adjusted EBITA rose slightly to 57 million euros (versus 55 million euros in 2022).Net income from continuing operations was a loss of 283 million euros  compared with a loss of 529 million euros in 2022  which took into account a negative contribution of 311 million euros from equity-accounted earnings resulting from the impairment of the value of TCS shares.Group net income was a loss of 285 million euros  compared with a profit of 151 million euros  which included a profit of 680 million euros from ""discontinued operations""  mainly due to the distribution of TCS shares.Free cash flow  before interest and taxes  was positive at 13 million euros  down by 75 million euros compared with 2022  due to the decline in EBITDA and above all to the negative impact of changes in working capital.At year-end  Vantiva held cash and cash equivalents of 133 million euros and an undrawn credit line of 76 million euros.Total net debt (excluding asset leases) amounted to 366 million euros (nominal).Luis Martinez-Amago  Chief Executive Officer of Vantiva  said:""We are proud to have achieved our targets against a backdrop of reduced customer orders in both our Connected Home where customers are still holding excess inventories and Supply Chain Solutions where the new diversified offer is still not compensated the natural decline in Disks. The strong resilience shown by our improved adjusted EBITDA margin  despite the significant drop in sales  demonstrates the company's agility and responsiveness in responding to a highly volatile environment in a context of cost inflation. This performance gives me particular confidence in the successful integration of the acquisition of CommScope's Home Networks business.This acquisition is a strategic turning point for Vantiva and ideally positions the group to meet the challenges of our industry and achieve unprecedented financial results for the company. I would like to thank all our teams for their commitment  without which these results would not have been possible"".I- Key points 2023 and outlook 2024In € million  continuing operations 2023 2022 Real exchange rates Constant exchange rates Sales figures 2 075 2 776 (25.3)% (23.3)% Adjusted EBITDA 142 161 (11.7)% (9.2)% As % of sales 6.8% 5.8% 105 bps 106 bps Adjusted EBITA 57 55 2.9% 6.1% Free cash flow before interest and taxes 13 88 (75) (74)Key points 2023The group's business was penalized by the general economic environment and the reduction in investment budgets by major telecom network and cable operators  against a backdrop of high inventories. The company's responsiveness to this situation enabled it to limit the decline in adjusted EBITDA in absolute terms  and to improve the margin as a percentage.Vantiva sales totaled 2 075 million euros  down 25.3% (-23.3% at constant exchange rates). ""Connected Home"" contributed 1 563 million  down 26.3% (-24.2% at constant exchange rates)  while ""Supply Chain Solutions"" sales fell by 21.9% to 512 million euros (-20.3% at constant exchange rates).Adjusted EBITDA came to 142 million euros for the group. The decline in this indicator was limited to 19 million euros. This decline was mainly due to the impact of lower sales in both divisions  largely but not totally offset by cost-cutting measures and tight control of central costs.The contribution of ""Connected Home"" is 120 million euros (compared with 135 million in 2022) and that of ""Supply Chain Solutions"" 45 million euros (compared with 56 million in 2022).Cost-containment measures improved EBITDA margin  which rose by 105 basis points to 6.8% of sales.Free cash flow before financial expenses and taxes is positive at €13 million  compared with €88 million in 2022. This deterioration is largely explained by lower EBITDA and the negative impact of changes in working capital.OutlookThe beginning of the year confirms that 2024 should be another challenging year for Connected Home business. Major telco operators are cutting their capex program for the year and this will weigh on demand for CPE. We are expecting the market to start to recover by the end of 2024.For Supply Chain Solutions  Vantiva anticipates a natural decline in demand for optical discs  and an increase in sales for ""growth activities"". The increase in vinyl records production capacity should continue to be one of the main growth drivers in this area.Against this backdrop  Vantiva management will be focused on the success of Home Networks’ integration and will continue to make the needed structural adjustments for preserving the profitability.For the fiscal year 2024  the group aims to achieve the following:Adjusted EBITDA > €140 millionFCF(1)> €0 million(1)After financial expenses and taxes and before restructuring and integration costs related to HN acquisition.This outlook is based on a €/$ parity assumption of 1.08.By 2026  the management is confident that Vantiva will generate a sustainable and healthy positive FCF  after interest  tax and restructuring costs.II- Analysis by division - Highlights of 2023 resultsConnected HomeBreakdown of sales by productIn € million 2023 2022 Real exchange rates Constant exchange rates Sales figures 1 563 2 120 (26.3)% (24.2)% Of which Broadband 1 262 1 598 (21.1)% (19.0)% Video 301 522 (42.3)% (39.9)% Adjusted EBITDA 120 135 (10.4)% (8.3)% As % of sales 7.7% 6.3%The contribution of the Connected Home division accounted for 75% of group sales (versus 76% in 2022) and totaled 1 563 million euros  down 26.3%. At constant exchange rates  the decline would have been -24.2% compared with 2022. This is primarily the result of falling volumes in all regions where the group is active  due to reduced investment programs by telecom and cable network operators. Broadband products  especially fiber  held up better than video products  which were particularly hard hit  notably in North America  by the decline in Android TV products. Broadband accounted for over 80% of the division's sales  compared with 75% the previous year.The division's adjusted EBITDA represented 85% of the group total  versus 84% in 2022. It amounted to 120 million euros for 2023 versus 135 million in 2022  or 7.7% of sales (6.3% in 2022). This increase in the margin rate illustrates the cost-cutting measures rapidly deployed to offset the decline in activity.Supply Chain SolutionsSales and EBITDAIn € million 2023 2022 Real exchange rates Constant exchange rates Sales figures 512 655 (21.9)% (20.3)% Adjusted EBITDA 45 56 (20.4)% (18.4)% As % of sales 8.8% 8.6%Sales for the “Supply Chain Solutions” division amounted to €512 million in 2023  down 21.9% on 2022. At constant exchange rates  the decline would have been -20.3%. The structural decline in optical disc sales was amplified by the downturn in consumer discretionary spending  particularly in North America  but partially offset by price increases. Other logistic activities remained relatively stable despite this unfavorable environment. Vinyl record sales rose following the commissioning of new production capacity.The division's adjusted EBITDA amounted to 45 million euros (vs. 56 million in 2022)  representing 8.8% of sales vs. 8.6% in 2022. The decline was limited thanks to cost reductions  price increases and the ramp-up of the vinyl record business.

The contribution of the ""Supply chain Solutions"" division fell by a similar amount  due to the continuing downturn in the DVD business  marginally offset by an increase in growth activities.Adjusted EBITDA totaled 142 million euros  down 11.7% and 9.2% at constant exchange rates. By contrast  adjusted EBITDA margin improved by 105 basis points to 6.8% of sales. This improvement  against a backdrop of a significant contraction in business  reflects the impact of cost-cutting measures which were implemented rapidly and effectively.Adjusted EBITA of €57 million was up €2 million despite the fall in adjusted EBITDA  due to lower depreciation and provisions.PPA amortization totaled -26 million euros  compared with 31 million euros.Non-recurring items showed a negative balance of 167 million euros  due to:Restructuring costs of -14 million euros  compared with -17 million in 2022  following a drop in expenses for “Supply Chain Solutions” and Corporate  while they increased by 2 million for “Connected Home"";of -14 million euros  compared with -17 million in 2022  following a drop in expenses for “Supply Chain Solutions” and Corporate  while they increased by 2 million for “Connected Home""; Other income and expenses  which represented an expense of -14 million euros versus -13 million euros the previous year  mainly due to costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of Home Networks;which represented an expense of -14 million euros versus -13 million euros the previous year  mainly due to costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of Home Networks; Impairment losses on non-current assets of -139 million euros (vs. -5 million in 2022) following the impairment of ""Supply Chain Solutions"" goodwill recorded in the first half of the year.As a result  EBIT is negative by -136 million euros  compared with a loss of -11 million in 2022.Net financial expense amounted to -107 million euros for 2023  compared with -177 million the previous year.Net interest expense on debt (excluding asset leases) came to -70 million euros  compared with -167 million euros in 2022. It should be remembered that the cost of debt in 2022 was impacted by the cost of early repayment of debt prior to completion of the Spin-Off.Other financial expenses of -37 million euros were mainly due to impairment of TCS assets and an increase in pension commitments.Income tax amounted to -15 million euros  compared with -30 million euros in 2022.Equity-accounted income was a loss of -25 million euros versus -311 million euros in 2022  mainly due to the impairment of the value of the 35% stake in TCS.Net income from continuing operations for the year was therefore -283 million euros  compared with -529 million euros in 2022.Group net income was a loss of -285 million euros  compared with a profit of 151 million euros  which took into account the gain on the valuation of TCS at the time of the Spin-Off.Cash flow and debt analysisIn € million 2023 2022 Real exchange rates Constant exchange rates Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations 142 161 (19) (15) Investments (77) (80) 3 1 Non-recurring expenses (cash impact) (45) (50) 5 5 Change in WCR and other assets and liabilities (8) 57 (65) (65) Free cash flow before interest and taxes 13 88 (75) (74)31/12/2023 31/12/2022 Gross nominal debt (including lease liabilities) 555 449 Cash and cash equivalents (133) (167) Net nominal debt (non-IFRS) 422 282 IFRS adjustments (15) (19) Net financial debt (IFRS) 407 263Free cash flow before interest and taxes fell from +88 million euros to +13 million. This decline was due to adjusted EBITDA (-19 million)  and changes in working capital (-65 million)  while capital expenditure and restructuring costs were down by 3 and 4 million euros respectively.The change in working capital requirements is mainly due to the negative impact of lower sales and customer order deferrals.Pension commitments fell by 10 million euros after taking into account payments made for 28 million euros  a negative actuarial effect of 7 million euros and a net charge for the year of 12 million euros.Cash out for restructuring amounted to -18 million euros versus -22 million euros.Capital expenditure amounted to -77 million euros  a decrease of 3 million euros compared to 2022. Most of this was R&D capital expenditure.The cash position at the end of December 2023 was 133 million euros  compared with 167 million euros a year earlier.Nominal net debt at the end of the year stood at 422 million euros  an increase of 140 million due mainly to negative FCF (after interest and tax cash out)  non-cash interest and new leases.Under IFRS  net debt was €407 million at December 31  2023.Post-closing eventOn October 3  2023  the group announced an agreement to acquire CommScope's home connectivity business.

The auditors conducted a limited review of the condensed consolidated half-yearly financial statements.Moez-Alexandre Zouari  Chief Executive Officer of TERACT  stated: "" In a context still not very buoyant in H12023-2024  TERACT has met its commitments to grow sales and its EBITDA thanks to the performance of Food Retail as well as Garden Centre /Pet Retail  which benefits from development of its own brands and costs improvement. TERACT continues to pursue its objectives of new stores opening  dynamic franchise  exclusive brands and digital model development. ""Foreword to H1 results: seasonality effectsTERACT's business volume varies considerably over the course of the year  which can make it difficult to compare the consolidated financial statements for the first and second half-year periods. Seasonality effects have a particularly strong impact on revenue  EBITDA  current operating income and cash flow generation. In terms of Group revenue  the second half (1 January to 30 June) is typically stronger than the first half (1 July to 31 December)  notably due to increased activity over the ""peak season"" (March to June) in the Garden Centre segment. In contrast  most operating expenses (personnel costs  amortisation expenses  etc.) being spread out linearly over the year  the Group's current operating income is historically weaker in the first half than in the second one.Key figures in H1 2023-2024Breakdown of revenue by segment(in million euros)RevenueGarden Centre/Pet Retail Food Retail357.4 336.02 21.3397.3 323.6 73.7+11.2% -2.3%-3.7% -2.8%X3.5 +3.8%Financial indicators(in million euros)Revenue Adjusted EBITDA3H1 2022-2023 357.4 (0.8)As a % of revenue-Current operating income Group net incomeFree cash-flow 4(25.7) (40.8) (62.1)(30.3) (132.5) (25.8)51 Constant scope restating all changes in the scope of consolidation.2Includes additional revenue in relation to the data published 16 February 2023 on H1 2022-2023 due to the deployment of exclusive brands. Adjusted in rela- tion to the data published on 15 February 2024 to account for an impact of €1.5 million.3Defined as current operating income plus the elimination of expenses (or income) related to depreciation/ amortisation or impairment (or reversals of depreciation/amortisation or impairment) of fixed assets.4Based on net cash flow from operating activities  plus disposals and deductions of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets and after the de-duction of acquisition of in property  plant and equipment and intangible assets.5 Restated for the outflow of non-recurring expenses related to the combination transaction in the amount of €7.8 million in H1 2022-2023.Analysis of H1 2023-2024 resultsRevenue in the first half of 2023-2024 amounted to €397.3 million  up +11.2% on a reported basis and down -2.3% like-for-like compared to the first half of 2022-2023.Consolidated revenue for the Garden Centre/Pet Retail business  which includes the Jardiland  Gamm vert (and Frais d'ICI corners)  Delbard  Jardineries du Terroir  and Noa banners  amounted to €323.6 mil-lion in H1 2023-2024  down -3.7% on a reported basis compared to H1 2022-2023. This is notably due to the fact that 22 integrated stores became franchisees  in line with the store network good management strat-egy. Excluding this scope effect  like-for-like sales broadly outperformed market trends6  which were im-pacted by the inflationary context  lower purchasing power  and adverse weather conditions.To better address its customers' concerns regarding their purchasing power  TERACT continues to develop its exclusive and innovative ECLOZ  INVIVO Nous on sème  PURE FAMILY  and SENS DU TERROIR brands that combine high quality with affordable prices. The penetration rate of own brands represented 22.1% of the revenue of integrated stores at 31 December 2023 (an increase of +4 points from 31 December 2022).Benefiting from TERACT's position as France's garden centre leader  the e-commerce business continued to grow at an accelerated pace with the rollout of the digital plan and the launch of the new gammvert.fr website over the period. It followed the launch  in early H2 2022-2023  of jardiland.com  which is already posting growth in H1 2023-2024. Following the agreement signed in September 2023  the marketplace will be launched in partnership with Mirakl by 30 June 2024.The consolidated revenue of the Food Retail sector  which includes the Bio&Co  Boulangerie Louise  and Grand Marché La Marnière banners  amounted to €73.7 million in H1 2023-2024 compared to €21.3 million in H1 2022-2023  benefiting from the full integration of the Boulangerie Louise and Grand Marché La Marnière banners acquired in late 2022 and consolidated over one month in the preceding half-year. Ex-cluding this scope effect  the 3.5-fold increase in Food Retail revenue is attributable to strong performance by the bakery/snacks and organic lines.Boulangerie Louise posted strong revenue growth thanks to a positive net scope effect from its integration as well as strong like-for-like performance by the banner after major efforts to optimise the offer over the preceding year. Store openings began with the Châteauroux and Champs-Elysées locations. The iconic Champs-Elysées location  where it replaces the Pomme de Pain banner  offers snacks and high-quality bread baked on the spot. The words ""Farmer-Miller-Baker"" on the storefront signage reflect the brand's commitments to the integration of the wheat sector  with local sourcing (mill within 50 km) and deep involvement in the farming community. Meanwhile  four integrated stores were closed over the period as part of continuous network optimisation efforts.6 The garden market was down -5.6% in July to November 2023 compared to the same period in 2022  according to inter-professional association Promojar- din/Prom'animal.Retail store sales were boosted by the recovery of the organic market  which began in mid-2023. Grand Marché La Marnière posted resilient sales while Bio&Co's sales were up thanks to efforts on the offer in line with emerging consumer demand for more locally sourced and closer to farmers organic products.Adjusted EBITDA was €7.3 million in H1 2023-2024  an increase of +€8.1 million from H1 2022-2023. On top of the effect on the Food Retail segment of the full integration of the Boulangerie Louise and Grand Marché La Marnière banners (consolidated over 6 months in the half-year period vs. 1 month in H1 2022-2023)  the Garden Centre/Pet Retail segment posted strong growth (+€4.8 million) thanks to efforts to improve mar- gins with  in particular  the deployment of own brands and costs control (in the context of the savings plans).Current operating income amounted to a loss of (€25.7 million) at 31 December 2023 compared to a loss of (€30.3 million) at 31 December 2022.The Group posted an operating loss of (€26.0 million) in H1 2023-2024 compared to a loss of (€119.7 mil- lion) in H1 2022-2023; this loss mainly included the impact of the listing expense related to the combination of InVivo Retail with the 2MX SPAC  which represents a non-cash charge of (€91.4 million).TERACT posted a Group net loss of (€40.8 million) at 31 December 2023 vs. (€132.5 million) at 31 December 2022  or (€41.1 million) when adjusted for the exceptional impact of the listing expense. Group net income for H1 2023-2024 was impacted by an increase in financial expenses (+€5.6 million) linked to higher in-terest rates and an increase in debt following the recent acquisitions. This rise was offset by improved EBITDA.Financial structure on 31 December 2023Free cash-flow(in million euros) 31/12/2023 31/12/2022 Net cash flow from activities (45.9) (12.4)7 Acquisition of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets (16.8) (15.2) Disposals and deductions of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets 0.6 1.8 Free cash-flow (62.1) (25.8) The Group's free cash flow at 31 December 2023 was (€62.1 million).Net cash flow from operating activities was (€45.9 million) at 31 December 2023 compared to (€12.4 mil- lion) at 31 December 2022. It consisted of:- Cash flow of €9.3 million at 31 December 2023 vs. €0.6 million at 31 December 2022  i.e. an increase of €8.7 million in line with improved EBITDA;-Change in WCR of (€54.5 million) notably impacted by the acceleration of own brand volumes  with part of the year's major import purchases having been anticipated from H1 at favourable pricing con-ditions.Operating investments  amounting to (€16.8 million)  were also maintained while being rigorously se-lected.Net debt(in million euros) 31/12/2023 30/06/2023 Medium- and long-term debt 551.2 468.8 Of which debt in relation to InVivo Group  the parent company of TERACT 332 222.8 Of which rental liabilities (IFRS 16) 213.2 225.0 Net cash 17 21.4 Net debt 534.2 447.4The Group posted net debt of €534.2 million at 31 December 2023 (of which €332 million with its parent company InVivo Group and €213.2 million in rental liabilities). The change in net financial debt from 30 June to 31 December is attributable to seasonality  as net debt at 30 June is structurally weaker given the significant business volume recorded at the end of the agricultural year.7 Restated for the outflow of non-recurring expenses related to the combination transaction in the amount of €7.8 million in H1 2022-2023.Outlook for 2023-2024Amid persistent macroeconomic pressure in the second half of 2023 (first half of TERACT's 2023-2024 fi-nancial year) and uncertainty as to how the situation will evolve in the first half of 2024 (second half of TERACT's 2023-2024 financial year)  the Group is maintaining and reinforcing its prudent approach to limit the effects of inflation and reduced purchasing power while improving the seasonal aspect of its business model in order to generate growth.New store openings  particularly in the bakery/snacks line  will help bolster revenue in a sector that con-tinues to offer high margins and a strong growth outlook and in which the potential for greater regional coverage is strong. Around 10 new stores are planned by June 2024  of which 3 have already opened since 1 July8. TERACT will also continue to roll out its own Garden Centre brands  for which it targets an increase in the penetration rate of 2 to 3 percentage points to 24% of the revenue of integrated stores in 2023-2024. For the 2024 calendar year  the Group plans to launch over 1 400 new exclusive brands. The company will also continue to ensure effective management and optimisation of its store network while pursuing the development of its franchise model  with 22 stores becoming franchisees in H1 2023-2024.This is underpinned by an attractive omnichannel model that is a leader in the sector in France  as part of an overhaul of the e-commerce websites and a focus on stores at the core of the digital strategy through the repayment of revenue to physical stores. This strategy was implemented in 2023 with the launch  in early H2 2022-2023  of jardiland.com  which is already posting growth in H1 2023-2024  followed by the launch of gammvert.fr in H1 2023-2024. As mentioned above  the launch of the marketplace following the signing of the agreement with Mirakl in late 2023 is planned by 30 June 2024.The strict cost management policy  particularly with regard to energy  is being maintained and reinforced through sustained efforts by the stores and headquarters. Thanks to these efforts  the Garden Centre/Pet Retail banners were able to reduce their electricity consumption between 39% and 45% compared to H1 2021-2022 levels. Finally  the operational integration of the companies acquired over the past year was finalized in H1 2023-2024.Taking into account these elements  and barring any further deterioration in the environment  TERACT still estimates that it will generate annual consolidated revenue of €900-950 million in 2023-2024.The launch of a new savings plan in late H1 2023-2024 aims to reduce costs by €15 million by 30 June 2025 in anticipation of continuing macroeconomic challenges and to absorb part of the residual inflation. Combined with reinforced inventory control  they should continue to have a positive impact on free cash flow generation while maintaining a CapEx level enabling the company's good development.In line with the projects undertaken over the past year  TERACT remains open to alliances that make good business sense and which would generate virtuous growth and improve margins. The upstream/down-stream integration within InVivo Group's agricultural sectors will also be pursued in an effort to link pro-ducers to informed consumers more directly and with a more favourable impact.8 On 7 March  Boulangerie Louise opened a new point of sale in Lens.Appendix1.

Although this authorization under the Code of companies and associations theoretically allows the acquisition of all shares of the company  the Board of Directors foresees that the treasury shares will not represent more than 10% of the capital. If the number of treasury shares exceeds this threshold  the Board of Directors will alienate the surplus of treasury shares or propose to the shareholders to delete them. The Board of Directors wishes to acquire treasury shares in order to meet its obligations under stock option plans or to finance acquisitions  not as a defense mechanism against a public takeover bid.A G E N D A1.

A maximum of ten percent (10%) of the capital can hereby be used for capital increases with suspension of the preferential right of existing shareholders or for contributions in kind for other purposes than the distribution of an optional dividend.The board of directors can use this authorization for a period of five years from the publication of the change of the by-laws decided by the extra-ordinary meeting of shareholders of 22 March 2024(*).The capital increases which may be implemented pursuant to this authorization in accordance with the terms to be decided by the board of directors such as  among others  a contribution in cash or in kind with the limits set by the CCA  incorporation of reserves or share premiums  with or without issuance of new shares with or without voting rights or by issuance of subordinated convertible notes  or by issuance of warrants or of notes to which warrants or other rights may be attached  or other instruments  such as shares in the frame of a share option plan.These authorizations can be renewed in accordance with the applicable regulations.In the interest of the company  the board of directors can  within the limits and in accordance with the conditions prescribed by the CCA  limit or suspend the preferential right of shareholders  when the capital increase occurs within the limits of the capital authorized pursuant to this article This limit or suspension can also apply to the benefit of one or more persons  which may or may not be employees of the company or its subsidiaries.If  pursuant to a capital increase decided by the board of directors or following the conversion of notes or the exercise of warrants or other similar rights  a share premium is paid  it will not be considered for the calculation of the use of the authorized capital.The mandate authorized capital cannot be used as a defensive mechanism against a public take-over bid.The board of directors has the authority  with the possibility to delegate  after every capital increase realized within the limits of the authorized capital  to update the by-laws with the new status of capital and shares.""Consequently  the general meeting decides  as of the publication of this decision in the Annexes to the Belgian Official Gazette  to replace the words ""29 April 2021"" with the words ""22 March 2024""* in the second paragraph of Article 6 of the by-laws and to delete the last paragraph of the said article.(*) If at the extra-ordinary general meeting of 22 March 2024 the required quorum to deliberate and decide validly is not met  the date of ""22 March 2024"" must be read as ""25 April 2024"".For the avoidance of doubt  if the proposed resolution is not adopted  the existing authorization to increase the capital will continue to apply.WRITTEN QUESTIONSEach shareholder who has completed the below formalities for attending the general meeting  can submit questions to the Directors or the Statutory Auditor with respect to the agenda topics.

It is registered with the Registry of Commerce and Companies of Pontoise under the reference 323 623 603. Atos SE shares are traded on the Euronext Paris market under ISIN code FR0000051732. The shares are not listed on any other stock exchange market. The Company is administrated by a board of directors.Atos is a global leader in digital transformation and is the European number one in cloud  cybersecurity and high-performance computing. Atos provides end-to-end vertical solutions  smart data platforms and infrastructure solutions  working closely with global technology partners and leveraging innovations in business platforms  customer experience and digital workplace  artificial intelligence and hybrid cloud.The consolidated financial statements of the Group comprise the Group parent company  its subsidiaries and the Group interests in associates and jointly controlled entities (together referred to as the ""Group"").The Atos Group did not change its corporate name compared to the previous period.These consolidated financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors on March 25  2024. The consolidated financial statements will be submitted to the approval of the next Annual General Meeting.1.1.6.2Basis of preparationAll amounts are presented in millions of euros unless otherwise indicated. Certain totals may have rounding differences.Accounting frameworkThe consolidated financial statements of the Group for the twelve months ended December 31  2023 have been prepared in accordance with the international accounting standards endorsed by the European Union and whose application was mandatory as at December 31  2023.The international accounting standards comprise the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB)  the International Accounting Standards (IAS)  the interpretations of the Standing Interpretations Committee (SIC) and the IFRS Interpretations Committee (IFRS IC).Accounting policies applied by the Group comply with those standards and interpretations.At December 31  2023  the Group applied the same accounting policies and measurement methods as were applied in its consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31  2022  with the exception of changes required by the enforcement of new standards and interpretations presented hereafter as well as the accounting treatment of certain third-party software resale transactions as described in Note 3.New standards and interpretations applicable from January 1  2023In response to the ""Pillar Two"" international tax reform that aims at introducing a minimum global tax rate of 15%  the IASB has amended IAS 12 to introduce a temporary mandatory relief from accounting for deferred tax arising from legislation implementing the GloBE - global anti-base erosion model rules  effective immediately and applied retrospectively in accordance with IAS 8. Under the relief  entities are exempt from providing for and disclosing deferred tax related to the top-up tax.The application of the amendments to IAS 12 - Income taxes: International Tax Reform - Pillar Two Model Rules was mandatory for the Group effective for the fiscal year beginning January 1  2023.In accordance with the relief  the Group did not account for any deferred income taxes in connection with Pillar Two in the consolidated financial statements.Besides  based on the available information  the Group has carried out a first assessment of the potential impacts related to the implementation of Pillar Two: this work revealed a limited exposure to the top-up tax which effects would be non-material. This assessment will nevertheless have to be reviewed in light of the contemplated disposals.The following other new standards  interpretations or amendments whose application was mandatory for the Group effective for the fiscal year beginning January 1  2023 had no material impact on the consolidated financial statements:⚫ Narrow scope amendments to IAS 1;⚫ Narrow scope amendments to IAS 8;⚫ Amendment to IAS 12 - Deferred tax related to assets and liabilities arising from a single transaction;⚫ IFRS 17- Insurance contracts.Other standardsThe Group does not apply IFRS standards and interpretations that have not yet been approved by the European Union at the closing date. In addition  none of the new standards effective for annual periods beginning after January 1  2023 and for which an earlier application is permitted have been applied by the Group.The potential impacts of these new pronouncements are currently being analyzed.Use of estimates and judgmentsThe preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  income and expense in the financial statements and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the closing date. As a function of changes in these assumptions or in circumstances that may arise  the amounts appearing in the future financial statements of the Group may differ from current estimates  particularly in the following areas:⚫ Revenue recognition: estimates of percentage of completion  cost to complete and potential loss at completion  principal versus agent analyses (Note 3 - Revenue  trade receivables  contract assets  contract liabilities and contract costs  and Note 12 - Provisions);⚫ Business combinations: fair value of the consideration transferred (including contingent consideration) and fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed (Note 1 - Changes in the scope of consolidation);⚫ Impairment test of goodwill and other fixed assets: key assumptions underlying recoverable amounts (Note 8 - Goodwill and fixed assets);⚫ Recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets: availability of future taxable profits against which deductible temporary differences and tax losses carried forward can be utilized (Note 7 - Income tax);⚫ Recognition and measurement of provisions and contingencies: key assumptions about the likelihood and magnitude of outflow of resources with no counterpart  estimates and judgments regarding the outcome of disputes in progress and  more generally  estimates regarding all provisions and contingent liabilities (Note 12 - Provisions and Note 16 - Litigations);⚫ Measurement of defined benefit obligations: key actuarial assumptions (Note 11 - Pension plans and other long-term benefits);⚫ Lease liabilities and right-of-use assets: assessment of the lease term and incremental borrowing rates used (Note 9 - Leases);⚫Financial assets: estimates and judgments relating to the recoverability of accounts receivable (Note 3 - Revenue  trade receivables  contract assets  contract liabilities and contract costs) and other financial assets.On a regular basis  estimates on long-term contracts are reviewed taking into consideration potential loss-making situations or risks of recoverability on contract assets and contract costs. The expected credit loss valuation is also reviewed to consider potential increased bankruptcy risk of customers.Effects of climate-related matters on financial statementsIn preparing the consolidated financial statements  the impact of climate change has been considered by Atos  particularly in the context of the disclosures required in the Corporate Social Responsibility section of the Universal Registration Document. There has not been any material impact on judgments and estimates arising from those considerations  consistent with the assessment made by Atos that climate change is not expected to have a meaningful impact on the viability of the Group in the medium term.In addition  in November 2021  the Group issued a sustainability-linked bond (refer to Note 6). The coupon of the last three years will be unchanged if Atos achieves the following Sustainability Performance Target (SPT): reduction in 2025 of Atos annual GreenHouse Gas CO2 emissions (Scopes 1  2 and 3) by 50% compared to 2019. In case the SPT is not met  the last three coupons shall be increased by 0.175%.Finally  an objective of carbon dioxide reduction was included in the performance criteria for the performance share plans attributed between 2020 and 2022 (see Note 5). This indicator measures the percentage of CO2 emission variation per € million of revenue (tCO2/€ million) over a 3-year period.Significant accounting policiesFinancial assets classification and business modelIFRS 9 defines three approaches to classify and measure financial assets based on their initial recognition:⚫ Amortized cost;⚫ Fair value through other components of comprehensive income;⚫ Fair value through income statement.Financial assets are classified according to these three categories by reference to the business model the Group uses to manage them  and the contractual cash flows they generate.Loans  receivables and other debt instruments considered ""basic lending arrangements"" as defined by IFRS 9 (contractual cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest) are carried at amortized cost when they are managed with the purpose of collecting contractual cash flows  or at fair value through other components of comprehensive income when they are managed with the purpose of collecting contractual cash flows and selling the asset  while debt instruments that are not ""basic lending arrangements"" or do not correspond to these business models are carried at fair value through income statement. Equity instruments are carried at fair value through income statement or  under an irrevocable option  at fair value through other comprehensive income.The business model of the Group is to collect its contractual cash flows for its trade receivables.Trade receivables can be transferred to third parties (banks) with conditions of the transfers meeting IFRS 9 requirements  meaning transfer of contractual cash flows and transfer of substantially all risks and rewards are achieved. Those trade receivables are in that case derecognized  further to the analysis of the actual transfer of risks  the non-materiality of any dilution risk based on experience  and the absence of continuing involvement.Current and non-current assets and liabilitiesAssets and liabilities classified as current are expected to be realized  used or settled during the normal cycle of operations. All other assets and liabilities are classified as non-current. The Group working capital requirement is defined in Note 4.6.Foreign currency translationThe presentation currency is the euro  which is the Group functional currency.Financial statements denominated in foreign currenciesThe financial statements of consolidated companies are prepared in their functional currency  corresponding to the currency of the primary economic environment in which they operate. The financial statements of foreign operations whose functional currency is not the euro are translated into euros as follows:⚫ assets and liabilities are translated at the closing exchange rate;⚫ income and expense are translated at the average exchange rate for the period;⚫ the resulting translation gains and losses are recognized in other comprehensive income on the line ""Exchange differences on translation of foreign operations"". When all or part of the investment in the foreign operation is derecognized (i.e.  when the Group no longer exercises control  joint control or significant influence over the company) the share of accumulated foreign currency translation adjustments is recycled to profit or loss.Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity have been treated as assets and liabilities of that foreign entity and translated into euros at the closing date.The Group does not have any entity operating in a hyperinflationary economy except Argentina and Turkey. Argentina is a hyperinflationary economy since July 1  2018 and Turkey since April 1  2022. As such  all income statement items from Argentinian and Turkish entities have been restated from inflation in accordance with IAS 29.Foreign currency transactionsForeign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rate prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At closing date  the corresponding receivables and payables are translated using the closing exchange rate.The resulting foreign exchange gains and losses are recognized in financial income and expense under the heading ""Other financial income and expense""  except where hedge accounting is applied as explained inNote 13 - Fair value and characteristics of financial instruments.1.1.6.3Financial risk managementThe Group activities are exposed to a variety of financial risks including liquidity risk  interest rate risk  credit risk and currency risk. Financial risk is managed by the Group Treasury department and involves minimizing potential adverse effects on the Group financial performance.Liquidity riskLiquidity risk management involves maintaining sufficient cash and marketable securities and ensuring the availability of funding through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities.Atos policy is to cover in full its expected liquidity requirements by long-term committed loans or other appropriate long-term financial instruments. Terms and conditions of these loans include maturity and covenants leaving sufficient flexibility for the Group to finance its operations and expected developments.10",neutral,0.01,0.98,0.01,neutral,0.02,0.95,0.03,True,English,"['2023 Consolidated financial statements', 'AtoS', 'March', '05', ""SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY Common stock Note"", 'cash flow hedge instruments', '4 Consolidated cash flow statement', 'other non current assets', 'Total other comprehensive income', 'Current financial instruments Note', '171 Non-current financial instruments', 'defined benefit plans', ""Total shareholders' equity"", 'Other current assets', 'Other financial income', 'Other non-current liabilities', 'Other current liabilities', 'Total comprehensive income', '2023 Consolidated financial statements', '1.1 Consolidated financial statements', 'Non-current lease liabilities', 'Total non-current assets', 'Total current assets', 'Other operating income', 'Consolidated retained earnings', 'Non-current financial assets', 'Total non-current liabilities', 'Total current liabilities', 'Other financial expense', 'Consolidated income statement', '92 Non-personnel operating expense', 'other operating provisions', 'Net financial income', '919 Tangible assets Note', 'Deferred tax assets', 'Personnel expense Note', 'Weighted average number', 'Deferred tax liabilities', '75 5,305 Intangible assets Note', 'ASSETS Goodwill Note', 'Consolidated statement', '876 TOTAL ASSETS', '656 TOTAL LIABILITIES', '639 Non-current provisions', 'Current taxes', 'Current portion', 'financial debt', 'financial position', 'financial provisions', 'cash equivalents', 'Net income', 'fixed assets', 'Operating margin', '2,450 Derivative liabilities', 'Basic earnings', 'Diluted earnings', 'Net cost', 'Net addition', 'Net charge', 'use assets', 'Tax charge', 'equity-accounted investments', 'non-controlling interests', 'fair value', '3 Exchange differences', 'foreign operations', '806 8,017 Trade accounts', 'similar benefits', 'equity-based compensation', 'free translation', 'Actuarial gains', '496 Borrowings Note', 'net profit', 'Revenue Note', 'notes receivable', '01 Assets', 'English', 'Company', 'French', 'website', 'Issuer', 'December', 'months', 'loss', 'owners', 'parent', 'shares', 'euros', 'items', 'period', 'sale', 'capital', 'pensions', 'Depreciation', 'release', 'Amortization', 'PPA', 'acquisitions', 'Impairment', 'disposals', 'Unrea', '€', '529', '13', '451', '2,412', '275']",2024-03-26,2024-03-27,marketscreener.com

The business expanded its leadership in generative AI and application management  securing its customer base with significant renewals and new business particularly in Manufacturing  Consumer Goods and Public Sector verticals in Europe. Eviden has also been awarded the first exascale supercomputer in Europe  a state-of-the-art machine that will allow the acceleration of European scientific research and innovation.In Tech Foundations  the business is executing on its transformation plan with a strong renewal rate with existing clients and contracts signature with new logos in both Digital Workplace and Hybrid Infrastructure including mainframe management  highlighting the relevance of our offerings and the quality of our service delivery.Our operating margin has improved year over year  reflecting the execution of our cost improvement plans  while our cash flow was impacted by workforce optimization  separation costs and lower working capital actions.Discussions regarding the potential sale of Tech Foundations to EPEI have concluded with no deal reached. We will continue to run Tech Foundations and Eviden as separate businesses and leverage the strengths of their respective offerings with a coordinated go-to-market strategy.

According to French law  a conciliation procedure lasts four months  which may be extended by one month; Maître Hélène Bourbouloux of FHB SELARL was appointed as conciliator.The purpose of this procedure is to facilitate a global refinancing agreement with the banks and bondholders of Atos SE’s (the “financial creditors”).The conciliation procedure concerns only the financial indebtedness of Atos SE and will not impact suppliers  employees  the governance of the Company  or other creditors of the Company or its subsidiaries.The Company intends to present the parameters of its refinancing framework to its financial creditors during the week of April 8th  2024 and to provide an update to the market. The Company’s objective is to reach a global agreement on the capital structure of the Company by July 2024.End of exclusive negotiations with EPEI for the sale of Tech FoundationsExclusive negotiations with EP Equity Investment (“EPEI”) for the potential sale of Tech Foundations announced on August 1  2023  did not lead to a mutually satisfactory agreement.

Atos will continue to run Tech Foundations and Eviden as separate businesses and leverage the strengths of their respective offerings with a coordinated go-to-market strategy.End of the discussions with Airbus regarding BDS potential saleOn March 18  2024  Atos was informed by Airbus that discussions related to the sale of its BDS (Big Data & Security) business will not proceed.Atos is analysing the resulting situation and actively evaluating strategic alternatives that will take into consideration the sovereign imperatives of the French state and will be in the best interest of its customers  employees  creditors and shareholders.Favorable court decision for Atos in appeal against TriZetto damages rulingOn March 13  2024  the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York  as part of Syntel’s ongoing litigation with Cognizant and its subsidiary TriZetto  vacated the remaining compensatory damages judgments entered in this case : (1) the $142 million New York trade secret misappropriation award and (2) the $59 million copyright infringement award. Therefore no compensatory damage will have to be paid by Atos. The District Court granted TriZetto’s motion for attorney’s fees in the amount of approximately $15 million.The case began in 2015  before Syntel’s acquisition by Atos. Throughout the trial and on appeal  Atos maintained that Cognizant and TriZetto had failed to meet their burden to show trade secret misappropriation and that their damages theories were improper as a matter of law.In its decision  the District Circuit  acknowledged that “the jury’s award was based on what now turns out to be legal error” and held that “the Court is compelled to vacate the jury’s remaining compensatory damages awards”.Asset salesThe Group completed its €700 million program announced in 2022 and is executing on its additional asset disposal plan of €400 million mentioned in the press release of July 28  2023. During 2023  the Group has generated net proceeds from asset disposal of €411 million  of which €190 million in H1 and €221 million in H2.Net debt and debt covenantAt December 31  2023  net debt was €2 230 million and consisted of:Cash  cash equivalents and short-term financial assets for €2 423 million  including benefits from working capital actions.Total borrowings for €4 654 millionThe Group remained within its borrowing covenant applicable to its bank financing  with a leverage ratio (net debt divided by pre-IFRS 16 OMDA) of 3.34 times at the end of December 2023 compared with the bank covenant of 3.75x.Refinancing discussions and liquidityThe consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended December 31  2023 have been prepared on a going concern basis. The Group’s cash forecasts for the twelve months following the approval of the 2023 consolidated financial statements by the Board of Directors  result in a cash situation that meets its liquidity needs over that period.The cash forecasts  which take into account the latest business forecasts  have been prepared in particular based on the following assumptions:The implementation of specific actions to optimize its working capital requirements  including in particular the continued access to a factoring program The continuation of the €400 million asset divestment program that was announced on July 28th  2023 The implementation of a new disposal program announced on January 3  2024. In this respect  the Group is actively evaluating strategic alternatives  having received several expressions of interest or indicative offers relating to various perimeters.At December 31  2023  cash  cash equivalents  and short term financial assets of the Group amounted to €2 423 million  including the benefits of working capital actions. Borrowings amounted to €4 654 million  of which €2 400 million of bonds and €2 080 million of bank financing. As a result  the total net debt for the Group amounted to €2 230 million at December 31  2023. In addition  the Atos SE’s leverage ratio applicable to the multi-currency revolving credit facility and the term loan A amounted to 3.34x at December 31  2023.Atos SE wishes to draw attention to the maturity of Atos SE’s borrowings and the risks associated with its refinancing. The coming maturities of its borrowings are as follows:The €1.5 billion term loan A  maturing in July 2024  provides for another 6-month extension option until January 2025 available to Atos under standard conditions (notably no event of default and payment of an extension fee); it should be noted that there is no ongoing event of default  since under French law  events of default linked to the appointment of a mandataire ad hoc or the opening of a conciliation procedure are considered void;The €500 million bond (Optional Exchangeable Bond) maturing in November 2024 The €750 million bond maturing in May 2025 The €900 million revolving credit facility maturing in November 2025 The €350 million bond maturing in November 2028  andThe €800 million bond (Sustainability-Linked Bond) maturing in November 2029.As stated in the January 3rd  2024 Market Update press release  the Group will need to take the following actions  either individually or in combination  in order to meet these financing maturities:Obtain new bank financing Access capital markets (debt and/or equity) Implement a major asset disposal program in addition to the €400 million disposal program announced on July 28  2023  andContinue specific actions to optimize its working capital requirement  including continued access to a factoring program.In this context and as indicated above following its press release of February 5  2024  Atos SE has entered into discussions with its banks and bondholders with a view to reaching a global agreement on the restructuring of its financial debt. Those discussions  that were held with the participation of the CIRI (“Comité Interministériel de Restructuration Industrielle”) and the mandataire ad hoc appointed since the beginning of February 2024  will continue under an amicable conciliation procedure in order to frame these discussions and facilitate the emergence of a global agreement within a short and well-defined timetable of 4 months  which can be further extended by another month if needed. Those discussions were still ongoing at the time the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31  2023 were approved by the Board of Directors.The Group has sufficient liquidity to operate business until a refinancing plan is reached and is also in discussions with its financial creditors regarding an interim financing  which would provide an additional liquidity cushion to the Group until a global agreement on the refinancing plan is reached.All these circumstances create a material uncertainty upon the ability of the Group to continue as a going concern in the event the Group is unable to negotiate a new refinancing plan or to execute an important asset disposal plan. In that case  Atos SE may not be able to realize its assets or settle its liabilities within the ordinary course of its operations  and the application of IFRS accounting standards in the ordinary context of going concern  in particular with regards to the measurement of assets and liabilities  may not be appropriate.Atos will inform the market in due course of the progress of the refinancing discussions with its financial creditors  its contemplated disposals  as well as any potential changes in its capital structure arising from a final global refinancing agreement  including the issuance of new equity  which will likely result in a dilution of the existing shareholders.2023 performance by Regional Business UnitIn € million 2023Revenue 2022revenue 2022revenue* Organic variation* Americas 2 441 2 794 2 626 -7 1% Northern Europe & APAC 3 163 3 199 3 123 +1 3% Central Europe 2 506 2 588 2 452 +2 2% Southern Europe 2 284 2 420 2 198 +3 9% Others & Global Structures 300 269 248 +21 1% Total 10 693 11 270 10 648 +0 4%In € million 2023Operating margin 2022 Operating margin 2022Operating margin* 2023Operating margin % 2022 Operating margin% 2022 Operating margin%* Organic variation* Americas 249 222 202 10.2% 7.9% 7.7% +250 bps Northern Europe & APAC 163 115 112 5.2% 3.6% 3.6% +160 bps Central Europe 31 -10 -23 1.3% -0.4% -0.9% +220 bps Southern Europe 99 106 81 4.3% 4.4% 3.7% +60 bps Others & Global Structures - 77 -78 -84 NA NA NA NA Total 467 356 289 4.4% 3.2% 2.7% +170 bps*: At constant scope and average exchange ratesAmericas revenue was €2 441 million  down -7.1% organically  reflecting a general slowdown in market conditions  delays in contracts awards and tougher comparison with the prior year. Both Eviden and Tech Foundations businesses contributed to that organic revenue decline.

Tech Foundations was impacted by contracts scope reductions  notably in Pharmaceutical and Finance verticals.Operating margin was €249 million or 10.2%  up +250 basis points organically. Eviden margin improved towards mid-teens and Tech Foundations reached mid-single digit reflecting stronger productivity and costs improvements.Northern Europe & Asia-Pacific revenue was €3 163 million  up +1.3% organically  reflecting strong demand from the Public Sector across Europe and solid performance in the Financial vertical in Asia-Pacific. Digital activities were up high-single digit on solid demand from application modernization and cloud transformation  partially offset by reduction in low-margin Lab-as-a-Service business and lower HPC revenue compared with the prior year  which benefited from several supercomputer deliveries. In Tech Foundations  growth came mostly from stronger Public Sector business in the United Kingdom and in the Financial sector in Asia-Pacific.Operating margin was €163 million  or 5.2%  up +160 basis points organically thanks to continued delivery optimization actions and tighter cost controls.Central Europe revenue was €2 506 million  increasing by +2.2% organically. Solid double-digit growth in Digital and BDS  driven by strong demand in the Public and Automotive sectors was partially offset by revenue decline in Tech Foundations  which was impacted by lower activity in Manufacturing and Banking.Operating Margin was €31 million or 1.3%  up +220 basis points organically. Both Business lines reported improvements in profitability reflecting the benefit of workforce optimization actions and tighter management of under-performing contracts.Southern Europe revenue was €2 284 million  up+3.9% organically. High-single digit growth in Eviden was driven by strong performance in Big Data and Cybersecurity and HPC. Digital also grew  benefitting from new customers contracts as well as demand for application modernization and decarbonation solutions. Tech Foundations reported a low single digit decline  as solid performance with Public Sector clients were offset by volume reductions in the Aerospace and Transport & Logistics sectors.Operating margin was €99 million or 4.3%  up +60 basis point organically  primarily from improvement in Tech Foundations profitability.Others and global structures encompass Middle East  Africa  Major Events as well as the Group’s global delivery centers and global structures.
