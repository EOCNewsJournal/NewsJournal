Jeanette Almberg has declined re-election. Additional information on Board member proposed for new-election  Marita Odélius  is set out below. The reasoned statement of the Nomination Committee is available on the company website  www.loomis.com. Marita Odélius (born 1961) holds a Bachelor of Economics from Uppsala University. She is a board member of Movestic Livförsäkring AB  Solid Försäkringsaktiebolag  Resurs Holding AB and Resurs Bank AB. Marita Odélius was the CEO of Fora AB between 2011 and 2021.

The accounting firm Deloitte AB is proposed for re-election for a term of one year  in accordance with the recommendation of the Audit Committee. In the event Deloitte AB is elected  the accounting firm has informed that the authorized public accountant Didrik Roos will be the auditor in charge. The auditor's fee is proposed to be paid according to approved invoice. Proposal for resolution on authorization for the Board of Directors to resolve on repurchase and transfer of own shares (item 15 on the agenda) The Board of Directors proposes that the AGM resolves to authorize the Board of Directors to resolve on acquisition of own shares  on the following terms and conditions: i. acquisition may take place on Nasdaq Stockholm  on one or more occasions prior to the next AGM; ii. acquisition may be made of such number of shares that Loomis' holding of own shares does not at any time exceed one tenth of the total number of shares in the company; iii. acquisition may be made at a price which falls within the prevailing price interval registered at each point in time (i.e. in the interval between the highest purchase price and the lowest selling price); and iv. payment of acquired shares shall be made in cash. Furthermore  the Board of Directors proposes that the AGM resolves to authorize the Board of Directors to resolve on transfer of own shares  with or without deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  on the following terms and conditions: i. transfer may take place on Nasdaq Stockholm and/or outside of Nasdaq Stockholm in connection with acquisition of companies or businesses  on one or more occasions prior to the next AGM; ii. transfer may be made up to such number of shares that are held by Loomis at the time of the Board of Directors' resolution on the transfer; and iii. transfer of shares on Nasdaq Stockholm shall be made at a price which falls within the prevailing price interval registered at each point in time. For transfers outside of Nasdaq Stockholm  payment may be made in cash  non-cash consideration or through set-off and the price is to be determined so that the transfer takes place on market terms. The purpose of the proposed authorization  and the reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights as regards the transfer of own shares  is to enable the Board of Directors to continuously adapt Loomis' capital structure to the company's capital requirements and to enable financing of acquisitions by using own shares. The Board of Directors has presented a reasoned statement in accordance with Chapter 19  Section 22 of the Swedish Companies Act. The Board of Directors shall be entitled to resolve on the other terms and conditions for repurchase and transfer of own shares. The Chairman of the Board of Directors  or the person appointed by the Chairman of the Board of Directors  is authorized to make such minor adjustments in the above proposal that may prove to be necessary in connection with execution of the Board of Directors' resolution on repurchase and transfer of own shares. Proposal for resolutions on (A) reduction of the share capital by way of cancellation of repurchased shares and (B) increase of the share capital through a bonus issue without issuance of new shares (item 16 on the agenda) Loomis has  on the basis of authorizations by previous annual general meetings  acquired own shares. At the time of issue of this notice  Loomis holds 4 819 374 own shares  corresponding to approximately 6.40 per cent of the total number of outstanding shares in the company. The Board of Directors proposes that the AGM resolves to reduce the share capital by way of cancellation of own shares  and to increase the share capital by way of a bonus issue in accordance with items (A) and (B) below. The resolutions are contingent of each other and are therefore proposed to be adopted as one joint resolution as follows. A. Reduction of share capital by cancellation of own shares The Board of Directors proposes that the AGM resolves to reduce the share capital by way of cancellation of own shares. The purpose of the reduction is allocation to unrestricted equity. The reduction of the share capital shall be made by cancellation of 4 279 829 own shares that are held by the company. The reduction of the share capital will be SEK 21 399 145 by way of cancellation of 4 279 829 shares. The resolution to reduce the share capital under this item (A) may be effectuated without obtaining permission from the Swedish Companies Registration Office or  in the event of a dispute  a general court  as the company simultaneously effectuates a bonus issue  as set out under item (B) below  with an amount corresponding to no less than the amount the share capital is being reduced with  as set out above. Combined  these measures entail that neither the company's restricted equity nor its share capital is reduced. B. Bonus issue With the purpose of restoring the share capital after the proposed reduction of the share capital  as set out under item (A) above  the Board of Directors proposes that the AGM simultaneously resolves on a bonus issue to increase the company's share capital by SEK 21 399 145 through a transfer of SEK 21 399 145 from the company's unrestricted equity. The bonus issue shall be carried out without the issuance of new shares. Statement by the Board of Directors In view of the Board of Directors' proposal for resolution on reduction of the share capital through cancellation of shares  the Board of Directors hereby issues the following statement pursuant to Chapter 20  Section 13  fourth paragraph of the Swedish Companies Act (2005:551). It follows from the proposal on reduction of the share capital that the Board of Directors proposes that the company's share capital shall be reduced by SEK 21 399 145 through cancellation of 4 279 829 shares for allocation to unrestricted equity. In order to achieve a quick and efficient cancellation procedure without the requirement of obtaining the Swedish Companies Registration Office's or a general court's permission  the Board of Directors has also proposed that the AGM resolves on restoring the company's share capital to its current amount by increasing the share capital with SEK 21 399 145 by way of a bonus issue without issuance of new shares. The amount is to be transferred from the company's unrestricted equity to the company's share capital. Through the reduction of the share capital due to the cancellation of shares  the company's share capital is reduced by SEK 21 399 145 and through the bonus issue the company's share capital is increased by the same amount.

Item 14 Resolution on the principles for appointing members of the Nomination Committee; to enter into force from the Annual General Meeting in 2024 Nomination Committee proposals The Nomination Committee shall consist of four (4) members to be nominated by the largest shareholders in terms of voting rights as recorded in Euroclear Sweden AB's information on the ownership structure at 31 August  provided that said shareholders wish to nominate a member of the Nomination Committee. Should any of the four (4) largest shareholders in terms of voting rights abstain from appointing a member  the next largest shareholder in terms of voting rights will instead be entitled to nominate a member  and so on. The mandate period of the Nomination Committee elected at the AGM extends until such time as a new Nomination Committee has been appointed at the next AGM. The Nomination Committee's Chairman should be the member nominated by the largest shareholder in terms of voting rights unless agreed otherwise by the Committee. Should  during the Nomination Committee's mandate period  one or several shareholders that have appointed members to the Nomination Committee no longer belong to the four (4) largest owners in terms of votes  the Committee can offer vacant positions on the Committee to shareholders to appoint members of the Committee with the aim of reflecting the voting strength in the Company. The Nomination Committee can also decide that the company's Chairman of the Board should join the Nomination Committee by offering a vacant position to the Chairman. Owners who have nominated members to the Nomination Committee have the right to dismiss said member and appoint a new member. If a member leaves the Committee before its work is completed  a replacement is appointed by the same shareholder who nominated the retired member or  if this shareholder is no longer among the four (4) largest shareholders  by the new shareholder who is part of this group. Changes in the Nomination Committee are to be made public. The company defrays any reasonable costs the Nomination Committee deems necessary for being able to complete its task. Before the task is accepted  the member must carefully consider whether a conflict of interest exists. The Committee draws up proposals on the following issues for decision by the AGM: proposals for the Chairman of the AGM proposals on the number of members of the Board and auditors. proposals for the Board of Directors proposals for the Chairman of the Board proposals for Board fees  broken down by the Chairman and the other Board members  as well as any remuneration for committee work proposals for auditors proposals for fees to the company's auditors proposals  if any  for changes to the process of appointing the Nomination Committee. These principles for the appointment of a Nomination Committee are to apply until resolved otherwise. Provided the above principles are adopted  for the time until the new election committee is constituted  the term of office of the incumbent election committee appointed at the 2023 AGM shall be extended. If the AGM resolves against the above proposal  the Committee proposes that the principles for appointing the Nomination Committee adopted at the 2023 AGM continue to apply.

For transfers outside of Nasdaq Stockholm  payment may be made in cash  non-cash consideration or through set-off and the price is to be determined so that the transfer takes place on market terms.The purpose of the proposed authorization  and the reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights as regards the transfer of own shares  is to enable the Board of Directors to continuously adapt Loomis' capital structure to the company's capital requirements and to enable financing of acquisitions by using own shares.The Board of Directors has presented a reasoned statement in accordance with Chapter 19  Section 22 of the Swedish Companies Act.The Board of Directors shall be entitled to resolve on the other terms and conditions for repurchase and transfer of own shares. The Chairman of the Board of Directors  or the person appointed by the Chairman of the Board of Directors  is authorized to make such minor adjustments in the above proposal that may prove to be necessary in connection with execution of the Board of Directors' resolution on repurchase and transfer of own shares.Proposal for resolutions on (A) reduction of the share capital by way of cancellation of repurchased shares and (B) increase of the share capital through a bonus issue without issuance of new shares (item 16 on the agenda)Loomis has  on the basis of authorizations by previous annual general meetings  acquired own shares. At the time of issue of this notice  Loomis holds 4 819 374 own shares  corresponding to approximately 6.40 per cent of the total number of outstanding shares in the company.The Board of Directors proposes that the AGM resolves to reduce the share capital by way of cancellation of own shares  and to increase the share capital by way of a bonus issue in accordance with items (A) and (B) below. The resolutions are contingent of each other and are therefore proposed to be adopted as one joint resolution as follows.A. Reduction of share capital by cancellation of own sharesThe Board of Directors proposes that the AGM resolves to reduce the share capital by way of cancellation of own shares. The purpose of the reduction is allocation to unrestricted equity.The reduction of the share capital shall be made by cancellation of 4 279 829 own shares that are held by the company. The reduction of the share capital will be SEK 21 399 145 by way of cancellation of 4 279 829 shares.The resolution to reduce the share capital under this item (A) may be effectuated without obtaining permission from the Swedish Companies Registration Office or  in the event of a dispute  a general court  as the company simultaneously effectuates a bonus issue  as set out under item (B) below  with an amount corresponding to no less than the amount the share capital is being reduced with  as set out above. Combined  these measures entail that neither the company's restricted equity nor its share capital is reduced.B. Bonus issueWith the purpose of restoring the share capital after the proposed reduction of the share capital  as set out under item (A) above  the Board of Directors proposes that the AGM simultaneously resolves on a bonus issue to increase the company's share capital by SEK 21 399 145 through a transfer of SEK 21 399 145 from the company's unrestricted equity. The bonus issue shall be carried out without the issuance of new shares.Statement by the Board of DirectorsIn view of the Board of Directors' proposal for resolution on reduction of the share capital through cancellation of shares  the Board of Directors hereby issues the following statement pursuant to Chapter 20  Section 13  fourth paragraph of the Swedish Companies Act (2005:551).It follows from the proposal on reduction of the share capital that the Board of Directors proposes that the company's share capital shall be reduced by SEK 21 399 145 through cancellation of 4 279 829 shares for allocation to unrestricted equity.In order to achieve a quick and efficient cancellation procedure without the requirement of obtaining the Swedish Companies Registration Office's or a general court's permission  the Board of Directors has also proposed that the AGM resolves on restoring the company's share capital to its current amount by increasing the share capital with SEK 21 399 145 by way of a bonus issue without issuance of new shares. The amount is to be transferred from the company's unrestricted equity to the company's share capital.Through the reduction of the share capital due to the cancellation of shares  the company's share capital is reduced by SEK 21 399 145 and through the bonus issue the company's share capital is increased by the same amount. The company's restricted equity and share capital will therefore remain unchanged after the implementation of the bonus issue.Following completion of the reduction of the share capital and the bonus issue  the total number of outstanding shares in the company will amount to 71 000 000.AuthorizationThe Board of Directors proposes that the AGM authorize the Board of Directors  or the person appointed by the Board of Directors  to make such minor adjustments to the resolutions according to item (A) and (B) above as may be required for registration of the resolutions with the Swedish Companies Registration Office or Euroclear Sweden AB and to take such other measures required to execute the resolutions.C.

This proposal is divided into five items:A. Terms of LTIP 2024B. Issue of warrantsC. Transfer of shares and/or warrantsD. If item C is not approved  the Board proposes that hedging of LTIP 2024 shall take place via an equity swap agreement with a third partyE. Other matters related to LTIP 2024A. Terms of LTIP 2024A.1 IntroductionThe Board wishes to establish a long-term incentive program for certain key employees in order to encourage personal long-term ownership in the Company as well as to increase and enhance its ability to recruit  retain and motivate employees. The Board therefore proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to implement a long-term performance share program 2024 (""LTIP 2024""). The intention is also to use LTIP 2024 to unite the interest of the employees with the interests of shareholders.Participants may  after a qualifying period  receive allotments of Vitrolife ordinary shares without consideration. Allotment of shares  and the number of shares that will be allotted  will depend on the fulfilment of a predetermined performance target. The term of LTIP 2024 is more than three years.A.2 Basic features of LTIP 2024The LTIP 2024 will be directed towards certain key employees in the Vitrolife Group. The participants are based in Sweden and other countries where the Vitrolife Group is active. Each participant may be entitled  after a certain qualification period (defined below)  provided continued employment during the entire period (except from ""Good Leavers"")  and depending on the fulfilment of a predetermined performance target linked to Vitrolife's total share return (TSR)  to receive allotment of Vitrolife shares (""Performance Shares""). The participants shall not pay any consideration for the allotted Performance Shares.A.3 Participation in LTIP 2024LTIP 2024 is directed towards a maximum of 40 employees  divided into three categories of participants as follows:Categories Maximum number of shares 1. CEO 60 000 2. Other members of the executive management team (maximum 9 persons) 35 000 (per person) 3. Other key employees (maximum 30 persons) 20 000 (per person) Total maximum number of shares 400 000Any resolution on participation or implementation of LTIP 2024 shall be conditional on that it  in the Board's judgement  can be offered with reasonable administrative costs and financial effects.A.4 Allotment of Performance SharesAllotment of Performance Shares within LTIP 2024 will be made during a limited period of time following the Annual General Meeting 2027. The period up to this date is referred to as the qualification period (vesting period). A condition for the participant to receive allotment of Performance Shares is that the participant remains an employee of the Vitrolife Group during the full qualification period up until allotment. Allotment of Performance Shares also requires that a minimum TSR performance target is fulfilled. The Board shall establish a customary definition of Good Leavers and determine whether any allocation shall be made to participants who are considered Good Leavers.The performance target is based on the Company's total share return (""TSR"") during the term of LTIP 2024. TSR is to be calculated based on the volume-weighted average price of the Company's share on Nasdaq Stockholm during the ten (10) business days that follows immediately after the Annual General Meeting 2024  compared with the volume-weighted average price of the Company's share on Nasdaq Stockholm during the last ten (10) business days of the three-year period following the Annual General Meeting 2024. Performance Shares will be allotted if the average annual TSR is at least 7.5 percent (the minimum level). 0 percent of the Performance Shares will vest below the minimum level. 50 percent of the Performance Shares will vest at the minimum level and 100 percent of the Performance Shares will vest at or above the maximum performance level which is 12.5 percent. Vesting and allotment will be calculated linearly between the minimum and the maximum level. The outcome will be communicated to the shareholders after the allotment of Performance Shares to the participants.Prior to the allotment of Performance Shares  the Board shall assess whether the allotment is reasonable in relation to the Company's financial results  position and performance  as well as other factors.If significant changes take place within the Vitrolife Group  or on the market  which  by the assessment of the Board  would mean that the terms for allocation/transfer of shares according to LTIP 2024 is no longer reasonable  the Board shall have the right to implement an adjustment to LTIP 2024  including  among others  the right to reduce the number of Performance Shares allocated/transferred  or not to allocate/transfer Performance Shares at all.A.5 Implementation and administration etc.The Board  with the assistance of the remuneration committee  shall in accordance with the resolutions by the Annual General Meeting set forth herein be responsible for the detailed design and implementation of LTIP 2024. The Board may also decide on the implementation of an alternative cash based incentive for participants in countries where the allotment of Performance Shares is not appropriate  as well as if otherwise considered appropriate. Such alternative incentive program shall to the extent practically possible be designed to correspond to the terms of LTIP 2024.The intention is that the Board shall launch LTIP 2024 as soon as practically possible after the Annual General Meeting.B. Issue of warrantsIn order to enable delivery of shares under the LTIP 2024 as well as to hedge the financial exposure that the LTIP 2024 is expected to entail  the Board proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to issue a maximum number of 480 000 warrants of series 2024/2027  without consideration  to a wholly owned subsidiary of Vitrolife AB (publ) (the ""Subsidiary"").Each warrant of series 2024/2027 entitles the holder to subscription for one (1) share in Vitrolife AB (publ) during the period from 6 May 2024  or the later date on which the warrants are registered  up to and including 1 July 2027. Subscription for new shares by way of exercising warrants of series 2024/2027 shall be made at a price per share of SEK 0.204  which corresponds to the quota value of the shares. The exercise price and the number of shares that each warrant of series 2024/2027 entitles may be subject to recalculation in the event of a bonus issue  share split  rights issue  etc.  wherein the recalculation terms in the complete terms and conditions of the warrants shall be applied. The subscription of warrants of series 2024/2027 shall be made no later than on 10 May 2024. However  the Board shall be entitled to extend the subscription period. There can be no over-subscription. For complete terms  see Appendix 1 and Appendix A1.If the warrants of series 2024/2027 are exercised in full  the share capital will increase by SEK 97 920.C. Approval of transfer of shares and/or warrants and hedging activitiesC.1 Number of shares and/or warrantsThe Board proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to approve that the Subsidiary may transfer a maximum of 400 000 shares and/or warrants to the participants in the LTIP 2024 in connection with allotment of Performance Shares in accordance with the terms set out in section A  as well as dispose of an additional number of maximum 80 000 warrants through transfer of maximum 80 000 warrants to a third party  as a hedging activity in relation to the Company's costs for social security contributions.C.2 Other conditions for transfer of shares and/or warrants to participants in LTIP 2024Share transfers to participants in LTIP 2024 shall be made without the participants paying consideration and shall be carried out at the time and subject to the otherconditions under which participants in LTIP 2024 have the right to be allotted Performance Shares.C.3 RecalculationThe number of shares and/or warrants that might be transferred under LTIP 2024 in accordance with sections C.1 and C.2 above shall be subject to customary re-calculation principles and may  consequently  be subject to re-calculation due to a bonus issue  share split  preferential rights issue  dividends and/or other similar events. Resolutions resolved upon by the Annual General Meeting 2024 shall not be included in a re-calculation of the number of shares.D. Hedge of LTIP 2024 via an equity swap agreement with a third partyIt is the Board's assessment that an issue of warrants to the Subsidiary and transfer of shares and/or warrants from the Subsidiary to the participants in the LTIP 2024 is the most cost-effective method of transferring shares in Vitrolife under the LTIP 2024. The board therefore proposes that the delivery of shares to the participants is secured by item C above. Should the necessary majority not be obtained for the proposal in item C  the Board proposes that a share swap agreement with a third party is entered into in accordance with this item D.The Board proposes that the Annual General Meeting  should the necessary majority not be obtained for item C above  resolves to secure deliver of shares to the participants in the LTIP 2024  and to hedge the expected financial exposure of LTIP 2024  by the Company entering into a share swap agreement with a third party  whereby the third party in its own name shall acquire and transfer shares in the Company under LTIP 2024. The relevant number of shares shall correspond to the number of shares proposed under item C above.E. Other matters in relation to LTIP 2024E.1 Majority requirements etc.The resolution by the Annual General Meeting regarding the implementation of LTIP 2024 according to item A above is conditional on the Annual General Meeting resolving either in accordance with the Board's proposal under item B or C above or in accordance with the Board's proposal under item D above.The resolution according to item A  B and D above shall require a majority of more than half of the votes cast at the Annual General Meeting. A valid resolution under item C above requires that shareholders representing not less than nine-tenths of the votes cast as well as the shares represented at the Annual General Meeting approve of the resolution.E.2 The value  estimated costs  expenses and financial effects of LTIP 2024The participants' rights to receive Performance Shares under LTIP 2024 are not securities and cannot be pledged or transferred. Neither are any shareholders' rights transferred to participants in the program prior to the day when they receive their Performance Shares and become the owners of the shares. An estimated market value of the conditional rights to receive Performance Shares can however be calculated.Based on a preliminary valuation in accordance with a Monte Carlo valuation model  the total value of the conditional rights to receive Performance Shares under LTIP 2024 has been calculated to approximately MSEK 43.072  under the following assumptions: a share price at the time of implementation of SEK 200  a market-based risk-free interest of 2.53 percent  a volatility of 40 percent and an annual employee turnover of 0 percent.LTIP 2024 will be accounted for in accordance with ""IFRS 2 - Share‐based payments"". IFRS 2 stipulates that the share awards should be expensed as personnel costs over the qualification period and will be accounted for directly against equity. Personnel costs in accordance with IFRS 2 do not affect the company's cash flow. Social security contributions will be recognized as an expense in the income statement through regular provisions in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The amount of these regular provisions will be revalued in line with the trend in the value of the right to Performance Shares  and the social security contributions that may be payable on the allotment of Performance Shares.Assuming a share price at the time of implementation of SEK 200 and costs for pension provisions to Swedish participants amounting to 35 percent  the personnel costs for LTIP 2024 is estimated to approximately MSEK 48.1 at grant of the Performance Shares  corresponding to an estimated annual cost of approximately MSEK 16.0.Assuming that the minimum performance target is achieved so that the 50 percent of the Performance Shares vest  a TSR increase of 7.5 percent during the qualification period  costs for weighted social security contributions amounting to 20 percent of the benefit value at the end of the qualification period and an annual employee turnover of 0 percent  the total cost for LTIP 2024 (including the personnel costs) is estimated to approximately MSEK 58.0 before tax  corresponding to an estimated annual cost of approximately MSEK 19.33 before tax.Assuming that the maximum performance level is reached so that the 100 percent of the Performance Shares vest  a TSR increase of 12.5 percent during the qualification period  costs for weighted social security contributions amounting to 20 percent of the benefit value at the end of the qualification period and an annual employee turnover of 0 percent  the total cost for LTIP 2024 (including the personnel costs) is estimated to approximately MSEK 70.9 before tax  corresponding to an estimated annual cost of approximately MSEK 23.63 before tax.The above calculations are based on a decision on hedging in accordance with item C. In the event that the Annual General Meeting decides on hedging measures regarding LTIP 2024 in accordance with the proposal under item D  costs of approximately MSEK 0.5 - MSEK 1 will be added regarding share swap agreements with third parties.In the view of the Board  the positive effects expected to arise from LTIP 2024  outweigh the costs associated with LTIP 2024.E.3 Dilution and effects on key performance ratiosThe Board's proposal to resolve on issuance of warrants in accordance with item C above entails a dilution effect corresponding to a maximum of approximately 0.35 per cent of theshares and votes in the Company if the proposed warrants are exercised in full. The dilution effect is calculated as the relation between the additional shares that the warrants will be exercised for and the sum of the current number of shares and the additional shares that the warrants will be exercised for.The costs of the LTIP 2024 are expected to have only marginal effects on the company's key performance ratios.E.4 The Board's explanatory statementAn individual long-term ownership commitment among the participants in LTIP 2024 is expected to stimulate greater interest and motivation in the Company's business operations  results and strategy. Moreover  the Board wishes to increase the ability of the Company to retain important executives and other key employees. The Board believes that the implementation of LTIP 2024 will benefit the Company and its shareholders. LTIP 2024 will provide a competitive and motivation-improving incentive for executives and other key employees within the Vitrolife Group.LTIP 2024 has been designed to reward the participants for increased shareholder value by allotting shares  based on the fulfilment of a performance condition. By linking the employees' remuneration to the development of the Company's results and value  the long-term value growth of the Company is rewarded. Based on these circumstances  the Board considers that the implementation of LTIP 2024 will have a positive effect on the Vitrolife Group's continued development  and will therefore be beneficial to the shareholders and the Company.E.5 Other share-related incentive programsThe Company has three outstanding share-related incentive programs in accordance with resolutions of previous Annual General Meetings: Long-Term Incentive Program 2021 (""LTIP 2021"")  Long-Term Incentive Program 2022 (""LTIP 2022"") and Long-Term Incentive Program 2023 (""LTIP 2023"") which were decided by the 2021  2022 and 2023 Annual General Meetings  which are based on performance shares.The Company's share-related incentive programs are described on pages 72 - 74 in the Company's annual report and also appears in the Board's remuneration report.E.6 Adjustment AuthorizationThe Board  or a person appointed by the Board  shall be authorized to make minor adjustments to the above resolutions that may be necessary in connection with the registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and Euroclear Sweden AB respectively.E.7 Preparation of the itemThe basis for LTIP 2024 has been prepared by the Board of the Company. The work has been supported by external advisors and has been made in consultation with shareholders. The Board has thereafter decided to present this proposal for the Annual General Meeting. Except for the staff that have prepared the matter upon instruction from the Board  no employee that may be a participant of LTIP 2024 has participated in the preparations of the program's terms.",neutral,0.03,0.96,0.01,mixed,0.48,0.06,0.46,True,English,"['Notice Annual General Meeting', 'Vitrolife AB', 'March', '02:27', 'Elite Park Avenue Hotel', 'corporate identity number', 'equivalent authorization documents', 'consolidated balance sheet', 'consolidated income statement', 'Annual General Meeting', 'Euroclear Sweden AB', 'voting rights registration', 'postal voting form', 'annual reports', 'annual accounts', 'organisation number', 'VITROLIFE AB', 'paper copies', 'financial reports', 'press releases', 'share register', 'legal entity', 'certified copy', 'registration certificate', 'authorized signatory', 'Such re-registration', 'special instructions', 'Further instructions', 'voting procedure', 'relevant item', 'voting list', 'two persons', 'executive management', 'telephone number', 'postal vote', 'vote cast', 'meeting venue', 'sustainability report', 'audit report', 'special form', 'full name', 'separate notification', 'Thursday 25 April', 'other nominee', 'previous AGM', 'proxy form', '17 April', '19 April', 'Notice', 'shareholders', 'publ', 'Company', 'Kungsportsavenyn', 'Gothenburg', 'entrance', 'order', 'environment', 'websitewww', 'vitrolifegroup', 'understanding', 'regard', 'questions', 'investors', 'circumstances', 'attendance', 'attendence', 'Box', 'Stockholm', 'personal', 'address', 'details', 'shareholding', 'information', 'assistants', 'representative', 'shares', 'bank', 'addition', 'advance', 'routines', 'case', 'mail', 'toGeneralMeetingService', 'votes', 'verification', 'anmalan', 'vpc', 'EuroclearProxy', 'conditions', 'entirety', 'extent', 'agenda', 'Opening', 'Election', 'chairman', 'Preparation', 'approval', 'minutes', 'Consideration', 'Presentation', 'CEO', 'auditor', 'compliance', 'guidelines', 'remuneration', 'effect', 'Resolutions', 'adoption', 'allocation', 'profit', '4.00', '3.30', '9.']",2024-03-27,2024-03-28,marketscreener.com

The forecast includes elements of uncertainty arising from change in purchase power and customer behaviour driven by inflation and interest rate levels. In addition  political strikes in Finland  geopolitical crises and tensions may have an impact on the availability and price level of goods.Puuilo's long-term targets There have been no changes in Puuilo's long-term financial targets or growth expectations  announced in connection with the listing. Puuilo's long-term targets for the financial years 2021 - 2025: Growth: Net sales above EUR 400 million by the end of financial year 2025 with annual organic growth in excess of 10%.Profitability: Adjusted EBITA margin between 17 - 19% of net sales.Dividend policy: Puuilo aims to distribute at least 80% of net income for each financial year in dividends  depending on the company's capital structure  financial position  general economic and business conditions  and future prospects.Leverage: Net debt to adjusted EBITDA below 2.0x. Puuilo will achieve the long-term net sales target clearly before the end of the strategy period. Updated strategy will be published at Investor Day on 23 April 2024. CEO Juha Saarela's review Puuilo's performance was strong during the financial year 2023. The year was challenging in the retail sector  but Puuilo's defensive concept proved its worth and grew significantly faster than the market in a challenging inflationary environment. We continued our growth according to the strategy and our performance holds up under comparison. In Q4  Puuilo's net sales increased by 12.4% and was EUR 76.8 million. Like-for-like net sales grew by 1.6%. Similarly  the number of customers increased by over 12%. During Q4  we opened new stores in Konala  Helsinki  and Varisto  Vantaa. In Q4  the gross margin was 36.7%  and it increased notably by 0.5 percentage points. The increase in the gross margin can be credited to reduced logistics costs and strong sales growth of our private label products. Adjusted EBITA was EUR 10.7 million  which corresponds to 13.9% of net sales. Operating expenses increased  due rather significant growth in personnel expenses  mainly due to new stores and salary increases. For the full financial year  the net sales increased by 14.2% to EUR 338.4 million. Like-for-like sales grew by 5.2%. During the Q4  we opened five new stores  which all have performed well since their opening. Cumulative gross margin was 36.6% (36.2%) and increased by 0.4 percentage points. We consider this a significant achievement  especially considering the current economic and competitive environment. The increase in cumulative gross margin was driven by reduced logistics costs  increased sales and share of our private label products  improved inventory turnover  and a shift in sales mix towards products in lower price points. For the financial year  our private label products accounted for 20.6% of the total revenue. Adjusted EBITA for the full financial year increased to EUR 54.1 million  which represents 16.0% of net sales. Last year's growth in net sales was driven by a rise in the number of customers. Puuilo is attracting new customers from both competitors and  naturally  through the opening of new stores. The growth in number of customers in like-for-like stores is a clear indication of strong demand and signals growth potential. The financial year was a solid performance from us  although our relative profitability slightly decreased. High inflation affects Puuilo's cost structure through salaries  rents  energy  and other expenses. In the current financial year  we are paying even closer attention to costs and aim to increase efficiency  particularly by roll-outing of order replenishment (Relex) and work shift planning systems. The new systems are now in use  and the results will begin to show during this financial year. Additionally  we believe that significant focus in the sales of our private label products will bring us even better gross margin. Logistics efficiency will continue to improve due to the centralization of warehouses. The effect of the measures will be realized during the current financial year. We approach the new financial year with great confidence. Last year Puuilo acquired three stores from Hurrikaani Oy  that have now progressed to the opening phase. Among these  the Nokia store was already opened in February with great excitement and the aroma of grilled sausages. The opening of the Ylöjärvi store will be celebrated on the day of this financial statement's release. The final store remaining for opening is Forssa. Following this  in the early summer  we will open the new store in Lahdesjärvi  Tampere. Further store openings later in the year will be announced separately. Thanks to the spring store openings  we are off to a flying start in the new financial year  and we believe that this financial year will be very successful as well. We forecast  that our net sales for the financial year will fall within the range of EUR 380 - 410 million and expect adjusted EBITA to range between EUR 60 - 70 million. The Board of Directors proposes for the Annual General Meeting that a dividend of EUR 0.38 per share will be distributed  which corresponds approximately 83% of the earnings per share and exceeds previous year's dividend by more than 10%. Thanks to Puuilo's solid growth rate  the company will achieve the long-term net sales target clearly before the end of the strategy period. Updated strategy will be published at Investor Day on 23 April 2024 To conclude this review of a strong year for Puuilo  I want to thank our customers  personnel and shareholders and wish everyone a happy and sunny spring!

The board's proposal for directed issue of warrantsA maximum of 2 700 000 warrants shall be issued for the Warrants Program 2024/2027.With deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  the right to subscribe shall vest in the company's wholly owned subsidiary  Enzymatica Care AB  Reg. No. 556701-7495 (the ""Subsidiary""). The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights is that the warrants shall be used within the Warrants Program 2024/2027.Subscription of the warrants shall be made on a designated subscription list at the latest within six months from the issue resolution. Over subscription cannot occur.The warrants shall be issued to the Subsidiary against cash consideration corresponding to the warrant's market value calculated in accordance with the Black Scholes formula. The calculation of the market value of the warrants shall be established by Aderio AB in connection with the expiration of the measurement period on 22 May 2024. Payment shall be made in connection with subscription.Each warrant shall entitle to subscription of one (1) share in the company. Subscription of shares by virtue of the warrants may be effected during the period as from 1 June 2027 up to and including 30 June 2027.The subscription price per share shall correspond to 400 per cent of the volume weighted average price according to Nasdaq First North Growth Market's official price list for shares in the company during a period of ten trading days prior to the board of directors' first directed offer to acquire warrants in the Warrants Program 2024/2027  however  the subscription price cannot be less than the share's quota value. The subscription price and the number of shares that each warrant entitles right to subscribe for may be subject to customary recalculation in the event of split-up or consolidation of shares  rights issues and similar events.The shares issued upon utilization of a warrant shall confer right to dividends as from the first record date for dividends that occurs immediately following effectuation of subscription to such extent that the share has been recorded in the company's share ledger as interim share.In case all warrants are utilized for subscription of new shares  the share capital will increase with SEK 108 000.04.B. The board's proposal for transfer of warrantsThe Warrants Program 2024/2027 shall principally be carried out in accordance with what is stated below.The Subsidiary shall have the right  on one or several occasions  to transfer the warrants to employees and consultants in the company  or a company within the group in which the company is the parent company  in accordance with the terms and guidelines set forth below. Transfer to participants under the Warrants Program 2024/2027 shall be made against cash consideration which shall correspond to the market value of the warrant calculated in accordance with the above. According to a preliminary valuation  the market value of the warrants corresponds to approximately SEK 0.07 per warrant (assuming a share price of SEK 3.01  a subscription price of SEK 12.02 per share  a risk free interest of 2.4 per cent and a volatility of 45 per cent)  calculated in accordance with the Black Scholes formula.The board of directors of the company shall resolve upon allotment of warrants  which shall be made in accordance with the following allocation  whereby it is noted that the distribution of warrants can differ between the participants in the respective category:Position Number of warrants CEO A maximum of 800 000 Senior management and other key employees (a maximum of 10 persons) A maximum of 500 000 per personThe number of warrants offered may never exceed the maximum number of warrants in the Warrants Program 2024/2027. The first allotment is scheduled to be made in May 2024.The participants can subscribe for a lower number of warrants compared to what is offered to the participants. Over subscription cannot occur.The warrants that may remain after the first allotment may be allotted to future employees and consultants in the company  or a company within the group in which the company is the parent company  or to such employees that have been promoted  at the market value at each given time in accordance with the allocation principles stated above  whereby the above-mentioned number of participants in the respective category may change. Transfer of warrants may not take place after the annual general meeting 2025.Right to allotment in the Warrants Program 2024/2027 requires that the participant  at the time of allotment at the latest  holds a position in the company or has signed an agreement regarding it  and has not  at such time  informed or been informed of that the employment or assignment will be terminated. The company shall  in connection with allotment and as long as it does not entail negative tax consequences for the company or the participant  have the right to repurchase warrants if the participant's employment or assignment in the group ends or if the participant in turn wishes to transfer the warrants.For participants in other jurisdictions than Sweden  it is implied that transfer of warrants is legally possible and that transfer  in the board of directors' opinion  can be carried out with reasonable administrative and financial efforts at their established market value. The board of directors shall be authorized to adjust the terms and conditions of the Warrants Program 2024/2027 to the extent required in order for allotment and exercise of warrants to participants in other jurisdictions  to the extent practically possible  to be carried out under the same conditions imposed by the Warrants Program 2024/2027.Other information regarding the Warrants Program 2024/2027The reasons for the implementation of the Warrants Program 2024/2027 and the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights is that the board of directors considers that a warrant program that gives senior executives and key personnel the opportunity to take part in the company's long-term performance promotes participation and responsibility and provides increased motivation and loyalty to work for a favorable economic development in the company. An incentive program is also expected to contribute to the opportunities to recruit and retain competent  motivated and engaged co-workers as well as to the fulfillment of the company's business strategy  long-term interests and sustainability.Since the warrants in the Warrants Program 2024/2027 are transferred at market value  the company's assessment is that the company will not incur any social costs due to Warrants Program 2024/2027. Hence  the costs related to Warrants Program 2024/2027 will only be composed of limited costs for implementation and administration of the program. Otherwise  the Warrants Program 2024/2027 is not expected to entail any costs of significance for the company  and for this reason no measures to hedge the program have been taken.In case all 2 700 000 warrants issued within the Warrants Program 2024/2027 are utilized for subscription of new shares  a total of 2 700 000 new shares will be issued  which corresponds to a dilution of approximately 1.53 per cent of the company's share capital and votes after full dilution  calculated on the number of shares that will be added upon full utilization of all warrants issued under the Warrants Program 2024/2027. The dilution would only have a marginal impact on the company's key figures ""Earnings per share"" for the full year 2023.Since previously  the Company has two outstanding incentive programs in the form of one personnel option program  resolved at the extraordinary general meeting in October 2021 (the ""Personnel Option Program 2021"")  and a warrants program  resolved at the annual general meeting 2021 (the ""Warrants Program 2021/2024""). The Personnel Option Program 2021 comprises a total of 250 000 personnel options  whereby 250 000 warrants have been issued to the Subsidiary to secure delivery of shares and to secure social security contributions. Within the framework of the Warrants Program 2021/2024  385 000 warrants have been issued and allotted to the participants. Each warrant in the Personnel Option Program 2021 and the Warrants Program 2021/2024 entitles to subscription of one new share in the Company. The Personnel Option Program 2021 lapses in December 2024 and the Warrants Program 2021/2024 lapses in September 2024.If all of the warrants issued in the Personnel Option Program 2021 and Warrants Program 2021/2024 are exercised for subscription of new shares  a total of 635 000 new shares will be issued  corresponding to a dilution of approximately 0.36 per cent of the Company's current share capital and votes after full dilution. In case all outstanding warrants in the Personnel Option Program 2021  the Warrants Program 2021/2024  as well as the warrants proposed to be issued under Warrants Program 2024/2027  are utilized  a total of 3 335 000 shares will be issued  which corresponds to a dilution of approximately 1.89 per cent of the Company's current share capital and votes after full dilution.The above calculations regarding dilution and effect on kay ratio are subject to recalculation of the warrants in accordance with the customary recalculation terms included in the complete terms and conditions for the warrants.The proposal of the Warrants Program 2024/2027 has been prepared by the remuneration committee together with external consultants. The final proposal has been resolved upon by the board of directors.Item 14 – Resolution on authorisation for the board of directors to issue new sharesThe board of directors proposes that the meeting authorises the board of directors until the next annual general meeting to  on one or more occasions  resolve to increase the company's share capital by issue of no more than shares corresponding to ten (10) per cent of the total number of shares in the company at the time of the meeting's decision of authorisation.However  such issues may not cause the share capital in the company to exceed the company's highest allowed share capital according to the articles of association. The board of directors may deviate from the shareholders' preferential rights. The reason for the board of directors' authorisation to deviate from the shareholders' preferential rights is to enable the company to raise new capital and to take advantage of future opportunities to attract new long-term owners and to finance the company's growth strategy. The authorisation also includes the right to decide on payment for the issued shares by set-off  in kind or other conditions as referred in Chapter 13  section 5  item 6 of the Swedish Companies Act (Sw. aktiebolagslagen (2005:551)). At a deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  the issue rate shall be determined in accordance with market conditions  taking into account any discount on market terms.The board of directors  the CEO  or a person appointed by the board of directors or the CEO shall be authorised to make any minor amendments required to register the resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office or due to other formal requirements.Item 15 – Resolution on guidelines for remuneration for senior executivesThe board of directors proposes that the meeting resolves to adopt guidelines for remuneration for senior executives in accordance with the following substantial terms.GUIDELINES FOR REMUNERATION FOR SENIOR EXECUTIVES IN ENZYMATICA AB (PUBL)1 Introduction1.1 These guidelines for remuneration include salaries and other remuneration for the senior executives in Enzymatica AB (publ) (""Enzymatica"" or the ""company""). Senior executives include members of the board of directors  the deputy members of the board of directors (if applicable)  the CEO  the deputy CEO and other individuals in the company management. The guidelines shall be applied in relation to every commitment on remuneration to senior executives  and every change made to already agreed commitments  which is resolved after the guidelines are adopted at the company's 2024 annual general meeting. These guidelines shall be applicable until the annual general meeting 2028  at the latest. The guidelines do not apply to remuneration resolved by the general meeting.1.2 The guidelines in their current form were prepared for the 2020 annual general meeting  primarily with the aim of adapting them to the new rules that had been introduced in the Swedish Companies Act. The guidelines are reviewed annually  and the views of the shareholders have been taken into account on an ongoing basis during the work. The proposal for guidelines presented at the 2024 annual general meeting is substantially consistent with the previous guidelines and has not resulted in any significant changes.2 Purpose and fundamental principles2.1 Enzymatica's long-term goal and business strategy is to continue to grow by increasing the market share and strengthen the position in existing markets  to expand into new geographic markets and to develop more unique health care products by the use of the company's enzyme technology. More information regarding Enzymatica's business strategy and sustainability work is available in the company's annual report.2.2 Enzymatica's principle is that the company shall offer remuneration levels and employment conditions needed to enable recruitment and retention of senior executives with the required competence  experience and expertise in order to achieve the business objective  implement the company's business strategy and to safeguard the company's long-term interests  including its sustainability  which these guidelines make possible.

Remuneration may consist of fixed salary  short-term or long-term variable remuneration  other benefits and pension.2.3 The remuneration is not to be discriminating on grounds of gender  ethnic background  national origin  age  disability or other such factors.3 The decision-making process to determine  review and implement the guidelines3.1 The Remuneration Committee shall prepare the board of director's proposal on guidelines.

The members of the board of directors  the deputy members of the board of directors (if applicable)  the CEO  the deputy CEO and other members of the company management do not participate in the board of directors' processing of and resolutions regarding remuneration-related matters in so far as they are affected by such matters.3.2 In the preparation of the board's proposal for these remuneration guidelines  the salary and terms of employment of the company's employees shall be taken into account by information concerning the total remuneration of employees  the components of the remuneration and the increase and rate of increase in remuneration over time having been part of the decision-making basis for the Remuneration Committee and the board of directors in evaluating the reasonableness of the guidelines and the limitations arising from them.4 Fixed salary and benefits4.1 The fixed salary for the senior executives shall be market-based and based on the individual's work duties  responsibilities  experience  competence and performance.4.2 Enzymatica offers other customary benefits to senior executives  such as company car  and occupational health services  equivalent to what is considered as reasonable in reference to market practice and the benefit for the company. Such benefits shall not exceed 10 per cent of the fixed annual cash salary.4.3 Where a board member performs work for the company (including through a wholly-owned company) in addition to their board work  a separate fee may be paid for this (consultancy fee). The fee is to be based on the current market rate and be proportionate to the benefit for the company and the extent to which such work contributes to the good financial and sustainable development of Enzymatica.5 Variable remuneration5.1 In addition to fixed salary  both short-term and long-term variable remuneration may be offered for rewarding target-related performance  depending on to what extent certain pre-established objectives have been met within the framework of the company's business operations. The goals may include financial as well as non-financial criteria  which are to be predetermined and measurable. The criteria shall be structured in such a way that they promote the company's business strategy and long-term interests  including its sustainability  for example by being clearly linked to the business strategy or promoting the executive's long-term development.5.2 The variable remuneration shall be relevant and reasonable in relation to total remuneration and shall not exceed 30 per cent of the fixed annual cash salary.5.3 When the measurement period for attainment of the criteria for payment of variable cash remuneration has ended  the Remuneration Committee shall determine the extent to which the criteria have been attained. As far as financial goals are concerned  the judgement shall be based on the latest financial information published by the company.5.4 The company shall have the possibility to withhold payment of variable remuneration where required and possible by law  if there are special reasons for it and withholding is necessary to serve the company's long-term interests  including its sustainability. Furthermore  the company shall have the possibility to reclaim variable remuneration paid on incorrect grounds in accordance with applicable law.6 Pension6.1 Pension benefits shall be contribution-based occupational pension insurances  which shall be marked-based in relation to what generally applies for equivalent senior executives on the market.

When termination is made by the senior executive  the notice period may not exceed 12 months and may not include any right to severance pay.8 Deviation from the guidelines8.1 The board of directors shall be entitled to temporarily deviate from these guidelines  wholly or partly  in individual cases if there are special reasons for doing so and if such a deviation is necessary to meet the company's long-term interests  including its sustainability  or to ensure the company's financial viability. As stated above  the Remuneration Committee's tasks include preparing the board's decisions on remuneration matters  which include decisions on any deviation from the guidelines. If such deviation occurs  the board of directors shall report the reasons for the deviation at the closest following annual general meeting.8.2 In the case of employment relations governed by rules other than Swedish  appropriate adjustments may be made to comply with mandatory rules or established local practice  while recognising as far as possible the overall purpose of these guidelines.8.3 The guidelines do not take precedence over mandatory conditions under labour law or collective agreements. Nor do they apply to agreements already concluded.Majority rulesFor a valid resolution on the proposal pursuant to item 13  the proposal has to be supported by shareholders with at least nine tenths (9/10) of both the votes cast as well as the shares represented at the meeting.

I can conﬁrm that each Director continues to contribute and perform eﬀectively and demonstrates commitment to their role as Director.Resolution 7 is a standard resolution which authorises the Directors to ﬁx the remuneration of the Auditors.Resolution 8 will be proposed as an Ordinary Resolution to renew the Directors' authority under Section 1021 of the Companies Act 2014 to allot shares up to an aggregate nominal value of €7 037 072 (representing approximately 33% of the issued ordinary share capital (excluding treasury shares) as at 27 March 2024 being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this letter).The total number of treasury shares held by the Company as at 27 March 2024 is 164 005 representing 0.46% of the total issued ordinary share capital (excluding treasury shares).The Board currently has no intention to issue shares pursuant to this authority except for issues of ordinary shares under the Company's employee share schemes or share incentive plans and the Board will only exercise this authority if it considers it to be in the best interests of shareholders generally at that time. This authority  if renewed  will expire on the earlier of the date of the next Annual General Meeting of the Company or 9 August 2025.Resolution 9 will be proposed as a Special Resolution to renew the Directors' authority to issue shares for cash other than strictly pro-rata to existing shareholdings in certain circumstances being  (a) in speciﬁc circumstances relating to rights issues  (b) any other issue of shares for cash and is limited to an aggregate nominal value of €1 066 223 (representing approximately 5% of the Company's issued ordinary share capital (excluding treasury shares) as at 27 March 2024 being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this letter) and/or (c) the allotment of equity securities pursuant to theCompany's employee share schemes or share incentive plans for the time being in force.The Board currently has no intention to issue shares pursuant to this authority except for issues of ordinary shares under the Company's employee share schemes or share incentive plans and the Board will only exercise this authority if it considers it to be in the best interests of shareholders generally at that time. This authority  if renewed  will expire on the earlier of the date of the next Annual General Meeting of the Company or 9 August 2025.Resolution 10 will be proposed as a Special Resolution to authorise the Directors to issue shares for cash other than strictly pro-rata to existing shareholdings. The proposed authority is limited to (a) the allotment of shares for cash up to an aggregate nominal value of €1 066 223 (representing approximately 5% of the Company's issued ordinary share capital (excluding treasury shares) as at 27 March 2024 being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this letter); and (b) will only be used in connection with an acquisition or other capital investment of a kind contemplated by the Pre-Emption Group's Statement of Principles (the ""PEG Principles"") which is announced contemporaneously with the allotment  or has taken place in the preceding twelve-month period and is disclosed in the announcement of the allotment.The maximum nominal value of equity securities which could be allotted if both authorities proposed by Resolutions 9 and 10 were used in full would be €2 132 446 which represents approximately 10% of the Company's issued ordinary share capital (excluding treasury shares) as at 27 March 2024.In respect of the authorities being sought under Resolutions 9 and 10  the Directors acknowledge the provisions of the most recent PEG Principles published in November 2022. Resolutions 9 and 10 reﬂect the template resolutions and the Directors conﬁrm that the Company will follow the principles set out in the PEG Principles. The Board has proposed a limit of 5% of the issued share capital of the Company (excluding treasury shares) in Resolution 9  and have opted to seek a further 5% for an acquisition or speciﬁed capital investment in Resolution 10  rather than the higher threshold of 10% set out in the most recent PEG Principles in each case  as the Directors believe that provides suﬃcient ﬂexibility to the Company at this time and will keep this under review in future years.The Board currently has no intention to issue shares pursuant to this authority and the Directors will exercise these authorities only if they consider them to be in the best interests of shareholders generally at that time. These authorities will expire on the earlier of the date of the next Annual General Meeting of the Company or 9 August 2025.Resolution 11 will be proposed as a Special Resolution to renew the authority  the renewal of which is usually sought every year  for the Company  or any subsidiary of the Company  to make market purchases of the Company's ordinary shares up to 10% of the aggregate nominal value of the Company's issued share capital with voting rights. The text of the resolution sets out the minimum and maximum prices which may be paid for ordinary shares purchased in this manner.The total number of conditional awards over ordinary shares in the Company outstanding on 27 March 2024 is 963 213 representing 2.38% of the issued share capital with voting rights on that date. If the Directors were to exercise the authority being renewed by this resolution up to the maximum allowed and to cancel such shares and all other shares held in treasury  these conditional awards would represent 2.65% of the issued share capital with voting rights (excluding treasury shares).The Board will only exercise this authority if it considers it to be in the best interests of shareholders generally at that time.This authority  if renewed  will expire on the earlier of the date of the next Annual General Meeting of the Company or 9 August 2025.Resolution 12 will be proposed as a Special Resolution to set the price ranges at which the Company may re-issue treasury shares oﬀ-market.The Board will only exercise this authority if it considers it to be in the best interests of shareholders generally at that time. This authority  if renewed  will expire on the earlier of the date of the next Annual General Meeting of the Company or 9 August 2025.Resolution 13 will be proposed as a Special Resolution to maintain the existing authority in the Company's Articles of Association which permits the convening of an Extraordinary General Meeting of the Company on 14 days' notice where the purpose of the meeting is to consider an Ordinary Resolution only.Resolution 14 will be proposed as a Special Resolution to authorise the Directors to apply for the cancellation of the listing of the Company's ordinary shares from the premium segment of the Oﬃcial List of the Financial Conduct Authority and to remove such ordinary shares from trading on the London Stock Exchange plc's Main Market for listed securities (the ""UK Delisting Resolution""). As the UK Delisting Resolution only impacts the listing of the Company's ordinary shares  only holders of ordinary shares are permitted to vote on the UK Delisting Resolution. Holders of the Company's 8% preference shares and 14% preference shares have conﬁrmed to FBD Holdings plc that they will abstain from voting on the UK Delisting Resolution.The Company's ordinary shares are  in Ireland  admitted to a primary listing on the Oﬃcial List maintained by Euronext Dublin and admitted to trading on the Main Market of Euronext Dublin and  in the UK  admitted to the premium segment of the Oﬃcial List maintained by the FCA and to trading on the Main Market for listed securities of the London Stock Exchange. The Board continually keeps the Company's listing arrangements under review. The Board has noted that in recent years the volume of trading in the ordinary shares on the London Stock Exchange is negligible as a percentage of the overall trading volume in the ordinary shares.Consequently  the Board considers that the cost of maintaining such a listing is no longer in the interests of the Company and its shareholders as a whole. The Company will maintain the primary listing of its ordinary shares on the Main Market of Euronext Dublin.The FCA Listing Rules require the UK Delisting Resolution to be passed at the Annual General Meeting in order to enable the Company to proceed with the UK Delisting.Your attention is drawn to the Appendix to this letter which includes further details in relation to the UK Delisting Resolution. You should read this Appendix in its entirety and consider whether or not to vote in favour of the UK Delisting Resolution in light of the information contained in the Appendix.Form of ProxyThose shareholders unable to attend the Meeting may appoint a proxy.

HOLDINGS PLC TO THE HOLDERS OF ORDINARY SHARESIN CONNECTION WITH THE PROPOSED UK DELISTING(incorporated and registered in Ireland with registered number 135882)27 March 2024Dear Shareholder Proposed cancellation of admission to the premium segment of the Oﬃcial List maintained by the FCA and to trading on the Main Market for listed securities of the London Stock Exchange1. INTRODUCTION On 8 March 2024  the Company announced that it was considering a proposal to cancel the admission of its ordinary shares to the Oﬃcial List of the FCA and to trading on the London Stock Exchange's Main Market for listed securities and if simpliﬁcation of the listing structures would be beneﬁcial for FBD. On 27 March 2024  the Company announced that  following shareholder feedback  the UK Delisting Resolution will be proposed at the Company's Annual General Meeting. The primary listing of the Company's ordinary shares on the Main Market of Euronext Dublin will not be aﬀected by the UK Delisting Resolution. The FCA Listing Rules require the UK Delisting Resolution to be passed at the Annual General Meeting in order to enable the Company to proceed with the UK Delisting. The Annual General Meeting is to be held at The Irish Farm Centre  Bluebell  Dublin 12  Ireland on 09 May 2024 at 11.00 a.m. A copy of the Notice of Annual General Meeting accompanies this Appendix (""Notice of Annual General Meeting of FBD Holdings plc""). Should the UK Delisting Resolution be approved by Shareholders  it will authorise the Board to request that: (i) the FCA cancel the listing of the Company's ordinary shares on the Oﬃcial List; and (ii) the London Stock Exchange remove the ordinary shares from trading on the Main Market. The purpose of this Appendix is to explain the background to  and reasons for  the proposed UK Delisting  the implications for Shareholders of the proposed UK Delisting and why the Board believes the UK Delisting to be in the best interests of the Company and its Shareholders.2. BACKGROUND TO THE PROPOSED UK DELISTING The Company is a public company limited by shares incorporated in Ireland. The Company's ordinary shares are  in Ireland  admitted to a primary listing on the Oﬃcial List maintained by Euronext Dublin and admitted to trading on the Main Market of Euronext Dublin and  in the UK  admitted to the premium segment of the Oﬃcial List maintained by the FCA and to trading on the Main Market for listed securities of the London Stock Exchange. The Board continually keeps the Company's listing arrangements under review. The Board has noted that in recent years the volume of trading in the ordinary shares on the London Stock Exchange is negligible as a percentage of the overall trading volume in the ordinary shares. Consequently  the Board considers that the cost of maintaining such a listing is no longer in the interests of the Company and its Shareholders as a whole. Accordingly  the Board has resolved to propose the UK Delisting Resolution at the AGM.3. REASONS FOR THE UK DELISTING The Board has decided to seek Shareholders' approval for the UK Delisting for the following reasons: ● an increasingly smaller proportion of the trading in the Company's ordinary shares is conducted on the London Stock Exchange over the course of the last number of years to the extent that the volume of trade on the London Stock Exchange currently constitutes a very small portion of the overall trade between the two trading lines particularly compared to the volume traded on Euronext Dublin (by way of illustration  less than 2 per cent of FBD's average total volume traded was conducted on the London Stock Exchange over the last 12 months); ● in that context  the cost and the legal and regulatory burden associated with maintaining admission of the ordinary shares to trading on the London Stock Exchange is  in the Board's opinion  disproportionate to the beneﬁts to the Company and its Shareholders;10",neutral,0.02,0.94,0.04,mixed,0.33,0.35,0.32,True,English,"['UK Delisting Resolution', 'FBD', 'March', '01:13', 'other independent professional ﬁnancial adviser', 'long term sustainable success', 'The Irish Farm Centre', 'next Annual General Meeting', 'FBD Holdings plc shares', 'personal ﬁnancial advice', 'aggregate nominal value', 'employee share schemes', 'Financial Instruments) Regulations', 'Investment Intermediaries Act', 'latest practicable date', 'speciﬁc circumstances', '14% non-cumulative preference shares', '8% non-cumulative preference shares', 'ordinary share capital', 'UK Delisting Resolution', 'advisory non-binding resolution', 'other agent', '14% preference shares', '8% preference shares', 'ordinary shares', 'Financial Services', 'Financial Statements', 'Companies Act', 'The Board', 'Annual Report', 'treasury shares', 'ACCOMPANYING FORM', 'IMMEDIATE ATTENTION', 'European Union', 'United Kingdom', 'Dear Shareholder', 'shareholder vote', 'oﬃce', 'formal evaluation', 'incentive plans', 'best interests', 'existing shareholdings', 'Markets Act', 'Ordinary Resolution', 'registered holding', 'total number', 'standard resolution', 'Special Resolution', 'bank manager', 'ﬁnal dividend', ""Directors' Remuneration"", ""Directors' authority"", 'CIRCULAR', 'PROXY', 'doubt', 'action', 'stockbroker', 'solicitor', 'accountant', 'Ireland', 'case', 'shareholders', 'ﬁrm', 'document', 'purchaser', 'transferee', 'sale', 'delivery', 'part', 'Letter', 'Chairman', 'relation', 'March', 'Notice', '11.00 a', '9 May', 'Bluebell', 'Dublin', 'pages', 'details', 'business', 'consideration', 'year', 'declaration', '100 cent', 'practice', 'election', 'Biographies', 'balance', 'skills', 'experience', 'composition', 'time', 'Group', 'performance', 'commitment', 'role', 'Auditors', 'Section', 'publication', 'intention', 'issues', '9 August', 'cash']",2024-03-27,2024-03-28,marketscreener.com

The repayment of capital shall be paid to shareholders who on the record date of the capital repayment on April 2  2024 are recorded in the company’s shareholders’ register held by Euroclear Finland Oy. Repayment of capital is paid on April 9  2024.The Annual General Meeting also authorized the Board of Directors to decide  at its discretion  on the potential distribution of assets to shareholders  should the company's financial status permit this  as repayment of capital from the invested unrestricted equity fund.

If the Company considers that any changes are necessary or appropriate  Shareholders will be updated through the Company website (www.spectris.com/investors/shareholder-information/agm/).As explained last year  we prefer to offer in person Shareholder meetings where possible and for this year's AGM I am pleased to conﬁrm that once again we will host a physical meeting in London. Given the extremely low attendance of our annual general meetings online when offered in previous years  we have taken the decision that the AGM will be an in-person only event. We believe our Shareholders continue to value the face-to-face interactions this style of meeting permits.e purpose of this document is to explain certain elements of the business which will be considered at the AGM. e formal notice of AGM (the ""AGM Notice"") is set out on pages 2 and 3 of this document and explanatory notes on the business to be considered are set out on pages 4 to 6.Board compositionBoth Bill Seeger and Ulf Quellmann will reach their nine-year tenure on the Board ahead of the AGM. As explained in the Governance section of the Annual Report on pages 80 to 128  the Board reviewed the length of service and succession planning for each director when considering the composition of the Board and resolutions to put to Shareholders at the AGM. In light of Bill's length of service and the selection and appointment of his successor  Bill will retire from the Board at the AGM. Cathy Turner succeeded Bill as Senior Independent Director in May 2023. Following a rigorous and independent selection process (more details of which can be found within the Annual Report on page 93)  the Board was pleased to appoint Mandy Gradden as a Non-executive Director inOctober 2023. Given Mandy's signiﬁcant experience as a FTSE 250 chief ﬁnancial ofﬁcer  it is intended that she will assume the role of the Chairman of the Audit and Risk Committee following the conclusion of the AGM.e search for a suitable successor for Ulf Quellmann is in progress. In recognition of the signiﬁcant experience that both Bill and Ulf have brought to Board discussions  as well as the relevant balance of Non-executive directors on theBoard  with three directors within their ﬁrst three years of appointment  it is intended that Ulf Quellmann be retained as a Non-executive Director for up to one additional year. eBoard believes that this will ensure continuity of oversight and experience  as well as ensuring that the Board can continue to follow the rigorous selection process initiated to identify a replacement for Ulf with the necessary strategic and executive leadership experience.e Board continues to consider Ulf to be an independent director. However  in recognition of the spirit of the UK Corporate Governance Code  and to avoid any perception of non-independence  Ulf will step down from his roles on the Audit and Risk Committee  Nomination and Governance Committee and Remuneration Committee with effect from the conclusion of the AGM. It is intended that Ulf retire from the Board ahead of the 2025 annual general meeting.Action to be takenAs a Shareholder  you are entitled to vote on various Company matters being considered at the AGM.Questions on the business of the AGM can be asked in advance or raised at the meeting  more details on this are set out on page 8.

If approved  the recommended ﬁnal dividend will be paid on 28 June 2024 to Shareholders on the register at 6:00 p.m. on 17 May 2024. e proposed ﬁnal dividend is in line with the Company's progressive dividend policy and represents the 34th successive year of dividend growth.A Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP) is available in respect of the ﬁnal dividend. A DRIP booklet and application form are available from Equiniti  the Company's registrar  at the address provided in the investors section of the Company's website (www.spectris.com).Resolutions 4 to 12 (inclusive)Election and re-election of DirectorsIn accordance with the Company's Articles of Association and in line with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code  each new Director appointed to the Board is subject to election by Shareholders at the ﬁrst annual general meeting following their appointment and each previously elected Director is required to stand for re-election at the following annual general meeting. is year  Mandy Gradden will stand for election by Shareholders for the ﬁrst time. More details on the process and rationale for Mandy's appointment can be found on pages 92 and 93 of the Annual Report.Biographical details for each Director can be found on pages 80 and 81 of the Annual Report and on the Company's website (www.spectris.com/our-story/our-board/).Details of the activities of the Board during the year and the 2023 internally conducted Board evaluation process can be found on page 88 of the Annual Report.As mentioned in the letter from the Chairman  the Board has carefully considered its composition in light of both Bill Seeger and Ulf Quellmann reaching nine years' service on the Board. Whilst a suitable successor for Bill has been appointed with Mandy Gradden taking on the role of Audit and Risk Committee Chairman from May 2024 and Cathy Turner becoming the Senior Independent Director  the search for a director with the requisite strategic and executive leadership experience to replace Ulf continues. With this in mind  the Board has decided that in order to ensure continuity and navigate through the transition of Bill to Mandy  it is intended that Ulf be retained as a Non-executive Director for up to one additional year.e Board continues to consider Ulf an independent director.However  in recognition of the independence criteria in the UK Corporate Governance Code  Ulf will step down from his roles on the Audit and Risk Committee  Nomination and Governance Committee and Remuneration Committee at the AGM with effect from the conclusion of the AGM. Ulf will therefore not sit on any Board Committee following the conclusion of the AGM. ere remains a majority of independent to non-independent directors on the Board.Having considered the skills and experience and the performance of  and contribution made by  each Director  and the independence of each Non-executive Director (particularly in respect of those who have served in excess of six years)  the Board is satisﬁed that all Directors continue to be effective and continue to demonstrate a great deal of commitment to their roles and that their respective skills complement each other to enhance the overall operation of the Board of Directors.rough the evaluation process  the effectiveness of theBoard as a whole is monitored and individual Directors provide ongoing consideration of strategic  operational  ﬁnancial and risk matters  and appropriately challenge management. Each individual Director has a variety of experience and skills that are relevant to the roles that they hold within the Spectris Group. e Directors' biographies contained within the Annual Report (pages 80 and 81) set out in further detail the skills of each of the directors. It is the view of the Chairman and the Board as a whole that these contributions  combined with the individual skills and experience of each director are the reasons why their contribution is and continues to be important to the Company's long-term sustainable success.As such  the Board unanimously recommends the re-election of each of the Directors.Resolutions 13 and 14Re-appointment and remuneration of auditore Company is required to appoint an external auditor at each annual general meeting at which accounts are laid before the Company  to hold ofﬁce from the conclusion of that annual general meeting until the conclusion of the next annual general meeting. e Audit and Risk Committee Report  set out on pages 95 to 101 of the Annual Report contains a summary of the review of the effectiveness of the external auditor. e ﬁndings of this review were reported in detail to the board and considered the independence and effectiveness of the external auditor. e Board recommends the re-appointment of the current auditor  Deloitte LLP  who was appointed for the ﬁrst time at the 2017 annual general meeting following a competitive tender process.Further  it is recommended that the Directors  acting through the Audit and Risk Committee  be authorised to determine the auditor's remuneration.Resolution 15Directors' authority to allot sharesUnder the Act  the Directors of the Company may generally only allot shares or grant rights over shares if authorised to do so by the Shareholders. In accordance with the current guidelines issued by the Investment Association (the ""IA"") the Directors conﬁrm their intention to seek renewal of the authority granted at the 2023 annual general meeting which expires at the end of the forthcoming AGM or  if sooner 26 August 2024.e renewed authority is to be limited to shares up to an aggregate nominal amount of £1 680 975 (being just less than one-third of the issued share capital of the Company (excluding treasury shares) as at 6 March 2024 (the last practicable date prior to the publication of this AGM Notice)).e Company held 4 112 887 shares in treasury at 6 March 2024  (being 4.08 per cent of the ordinary issued share capital of the Company (excluding treasury shares) on the latest practicable date). e authority conferred by this Resolution shall (unless previously revoked  varied or renewed) expire at the end of the Company's 2025 annual general meeting or  if sooner  23 August 2025. However  the Company may make an offer or agreement prior to the expiry of this authority which would or might require relevant securities to be allotted after the expiry of this authority and in such a case the Directors will be permitted to allot securities pursuant to such offer or agreement as if this authority had not expired.Other than in respect of the Company's obligations under its employee share schemes  the Directors have no present intention of issuing any shares under this authority  but they believe it to be in the best interests of the Company that they should continue to have this authority so that such allotments can take place to ﬁnance appropriate opportunities that may arise.Resolutions 16 and 17Directors' general authority to disapply pre-emption rights and directors' speciﬁc authority to disapply pre-emption rights in connection with an acquisition or speciﬁed capital investmentUnder the Act  the Directors of the Company cannot generally allot shares  grant rights over shares or sell treasury shares for cash without ﬁrst offering them to existingShareholders in proportion to their existing shareholdings without being authorised to do so by the Shareholders. Your Directors therefore require additional authority from Shareholders to allot shares  grant rights over shares or sell treasury shares for cash without ﬁrst offering them to existing Shareholders in proportion to their existing shareholdings. Circumstances may arise in which it would be in the best interests of the Company for the Directors to have the power to issue a limited number of shares or sell treasury shares for cash otherwise than to existing Shareholders  to take advantage of business opportunities as these arise or to manage the Company's capital base more effectively.Your Board proposes that the authority granted at the 2023 annual general meeting be renewed  to expire at the end of the Company's 2025 annual general meeting or  if sooner 23 August 2025  thereby enabling the Directors to allotOrdinary Shares and/or sell treasury shares for cash free of statutory pre-emption rights:(i) in the case of Resolution 16  up to an aggregate nominal amount of £504 292 being just less than 10 per cent of the total issued share capital of the Company (excluding treasury shares) as at 6 March 2024 (the last practicable date prior to the publication of this AGM Notice)  and(ii) in the case of Resolution 17 (in relation to an acquisition or speciﬁed capital investment as contemplated by the Pre-Emption Group's Statement of Principles)  up to an additional aggregate nominal amount of £504 292 (being just less than 10 per cent of the total issued share capital of the Company (excluding treasury shares) as at 6 March 2024 (the last practicable date prior to the publication of this AGM Notice).e Directors have no present intention to exercise the authority sought by Resolutions 16 or 17. If the authority sought by Resolutions 16 or 17 is used in relation to a non-pre-emptive offer  the Directors conﬁrm their intention to follow the shareholder protections in paragraph 1 of Part 2B of the Revised Pre-Emption Group's Statement of Principles last issued in November 2022 and  where relevant  follow the expected features of a follow-on offer as set out in paragraph 3 of Part 2B of the Pre-emption Group's Statement of Principles last issued in November 2022. In particular  the Directors shall not allot shares for cash on a non-pre-emptive basis pursuant to the authority in Resolution 15 in excess of:(i) an amount equal to just less than 10 per cent of the total issued share capital of the Company (excluding treasury shares); and(ii) an additional amount equal to just less than 10 per cent of the total issued ordinary share capital of the Company (excluding treasury shares) in connection with the ﬁnancing of an acquisition or speciﬁed capital investment which is announced contemporaneously with the allotment or which has taken place in the preceding twelve-month period and is disclosed in the announcement of the allotment or for the purposes of reﬁnancing such a transaction within twelve months of its taking place.e Directors will give due consideration to the possibility of giving retail investors and other existing investors who are not allocated shares in the non-pre-emptive offer an opportunity to subscribe for Ordinary Shares at a similar price.Resolution 18Share buybackse authority given to the Company at the 2023 annual general meeting to purchase its own Ordinary Shares expires on the date of the forthcoming AGM or  if sooner  26 August 2024.Share buybacks are a way of returning cash to Shareholders. Shareholders are asked at each annual general meeting for authority to carry out share buybacks  in order that the Company may do so when the Directors believe it is in the best interests of Shareholders.Notes on Resolutions continued£300 million share buyback programme announced on 19 April 2022As explained in the Notice for the Company's 2023 annual general meeting  it was the Company's intention to buy back £110 million of Ordinary Shares during the 12 months commencing 1 January 2023  in order to complete the £300 million share buyback programme announced on 19 April 2022. is £300 million buyback programme concluded during the year ended 31 December 2023  with a total of 3 269 829 Ordinary Shares repurchased and cancelled by the Company between 1 January 2023 and 31 October 2023  for an average price of 3 347.50 pence per Ordinary Share. is resulted in a cash outﬂow of £110.6 million  including transaction fees of £1.1 million. e share buyback programme was launched as a result of the Company's enhanced balance sheet and the pipeline of acquisition opportunities.£150 million share buyback programme announced on 11 December 2023Additionally  on 11 December 2023  the Company announced a further £150 million share buyback programme. e ﬁrst tranche of £50 million of this share buyback programme commenced on 13 December 2023 and is expected to be completed in the period up to 31 May 2024. Between13 December 2023 and 31 December 2023  113 067 OrdinaryShares were repurchased and cancelled by the Company  for an average price of 3 746.07 pence per Ordinary Share. is resulted in a cash outﬂow of £4.3 million  including transaction fees of £0.1 million.is resulted in a total of 3 382 896 Ordinary Shares being repurchased and cancelled by the Company during the year ended 31 December 2023  for an average price of 3 360.94 pence per Ordinary Share  with a cash outﬂow for the year of £114.9 million  including £1.2 million of transaction costs.e Directors have no present intention of exercising the authority granted by this resolution to make market purchases beyond those Ordinary Shares to be repurchased pursuant to the £150 million share buyback programme announced on 11 December 2023. However the authority provides the ﬂexibility to allow them to do so in the future.Your Directors continue to believe that it is in the best interests of Shareholders that the Company should be able to purchase its own shares in accordance with the Company's capital allocation policy. Your Directors consider that it would be prudent to be able to act at short notice in making such purchases if it will be likely to promote the success of theCompany for the beneﬁt of Shareholders as a whole  having regard to other investment opportunities open to the Company. In reaching any decision to purchase Ordinary Shares  the Directors will take into account the Company's cash resources and capital requirements and the effect of any purchase on gearing levels and on earnings per share.e Act permits the Company to cancel any shares purchased under this authority or to hold them as treasury shares with a view to reselling them at a future date or to use them for the purpose of employee share schemes. is would give the Company the ability to re-issue treasury shares quickly and cost effectively and provide the Company with additional ﬂexibility in the management of its capital base.Any transfers of treasury shares for the purposes of the Company's employee share schemes will be made within the recommended 10 per cent. anti-dilution limit set by the IA and no dividends would be paid on  and no voting rights would be exercised in respect of  treasury shares.Your Directors are seeking the authority to make market purchases of up to a maximum of 10 085 855 Ordinary Shares  representing just under 10 per cent of the issued share capital of the Company (excluding treasury shares) as at 6 March 2024 (the last practicable date prior to the publication of thisAGM Notice). e maximum price to be paid for an ordinary share of the Company on any occasion will be the higher of (i) 105 per cent of the average of the middle market quotations for an ordinary share of the Company (as derived from theLondon Stock Exchange's Daily Ofﬁcial List) for the ﬁve business days immediately preceding the day on which the purchase is made and (ii) the higher of the price of the last independent trade and the highest independent bid on the trading venue where the purchase is carried out (in each case exclusive of all expenses). e minimum price to be paid for an ordinary share of the Company will be: 5 pence (being the nominal value of an Ordinary Share).e authority conferred shall (unless previously revoked  varied or renewed) expire at the end of the Company's 2025 annual general meeting or  if sooner  23 August 2025. However  if a contract for the purchase of Ordinary Shares is concluded before the expiry of this authority but the relevant purchase will or may be executed in whole or in part after the expiry of this authority  the Company is authorised to execute such purchase as if this authority had not expired. eDirectors intend to seek renewal of this authority at subsequent annual general meetings.For information  the Company has no warrants outstanding and the total number of options to subscribe for equity shares outstanding on 6 March 2024 was 1 818 638  representing 1.8 per cent of the issued share capital of the Company(excluding treasury shares) on that date. If the full authority to buy back were to be used  the total number of outstanding options on 6 March 2024 would  assuming no further Ordinary Shares are issued  represent 2.00 per cent of the issued share capital of the Company (excluding treasury shares) on that date.Resolution 19Notice of general meetingse notice period required by the Act for general meetings of the Company is 21 clear days unless Shareholders approve a shorter notice period  which cannot  however  be less than 14 clear days. Annual general meetings must always be held on at least 21 clear days' notice. If prior shareholder approval has been obtained  companies may hold general meetings (other than annual general meetings) on 14 clear days'notice  provided electronic voting is made available to all shareholders. Your Directors  therefore  request authority to hold general meetings in the forthcoming year on 14 clear days' notice (""Short Notice"")  as they believe this gives greater ﬂexibility and the ability for a faster response if an unexpected meeting is required. Such authority will be effective until the Company's 2025 annual general meeting when it is intended that a similar resolution will be proposed. It is intended that general meetings will not be called on Short Notice as a matter of routine  but that Short Notice will only be used  in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code  when the ﬂexibility of using it is merited by the business of the meeting and the circumstances surrounding that business and where calling a general meeting on Short Notice is in the interests of Shareholders as a whole.Notes for Shareholders1.

The Cancellation Resolution is conditional  pursuant to Rule 41 of the AIM Rules  upon the approval of Shareholders holding not less than 75 per cent. of the votes cast by Shareholders (whether present in person or by proxy) at the General Meeting  notice of which is set out at the end of this Document.The Company has received irrevocable undertakings from Richard Griffiths  Polar Capital LLP and the Directors  and a non-binding letter of intent from Lombard Odier as set out in paragraph 9 of this Document  representing approximately 57.0 per cent. of the Company's issued share capital  to vote in favour of the Resolutions.In accordance with Rule 41 of the AIM Rules  the Company has notiﬁed the London Stock Exchange of the date of the proposed Cancellation which is expected to become effective at 7.00 a.m. on 26 April 2024.The purpose of this Document is to provide information on the background to and reasons for the proposed Cancellation and the Re-registration  to explain the consequences of the Resolutions and provide reasons why the Directors unanimously consider the Resolutions to be in the best interests of the Company and its Shareholders as a whole.The Notice of the General Meeting is set out at the end of this Document.2. BACKGROUND AND STRATEGIC CONTEXTThe Company's Ordinary Shares have been admitted to trading on AIM since its IPO in 2014  and during this time the Company has successfully raised c.£63.0 million through primary and secondary fund raises to support the ongoing requirements and growth of the business. Following the Company's strategic pivot to focus on immuno-inflammatory diseases  as announced last year  the Directors have continued to consider the Company's opportunities for value creation and optimal capital structure and believe that having access to larger quantum of funding than has historically been available to the Company through its AIM listing would allow it to pursue a greater number of opportunities to key value inflexion points. The Directors believe that as a private company  C4X will potentially have access to a wider range of investors to pursue more opportunities to develop and build its pipeline and advance its focused portfolio towards  and potentially into  the clinic. Further details as to the reasons for the Cancellation are set out in Paragraph 3 of this Part I below.C4X has a successful track record of out-licensed pre-clinical assets to world-leading pharmaceutical companies. The Company has signed three deals which have in total generated $55 million to date demonstrating its scientific and deal-making capabilities:lIn November 2022  AstraZeneca signed a world-wide exclusive agreement worth up to $400 million for C4XD's NRF2 Activator programme; the first milestone payment of $11 million was received in February 2024.lIn April 2021  Sanofi signed a world-wide exclusive agreement for the Company's oral pre-clinical IL-17A inhibitor programme worth up to €414 million; the first milestone payment of €3 million was received in July 2022.lIn March 2018  Indivior signed a licensing agreement for C4XD's Orexin-1 Receptor Antagonist Programme which it subsequently acquired in July 2023 for £15.95 million.With immuno-inflammatory drug discovery expertise at the core  C4XD is building a valuable and commercially relevant  small-molecule drug portfolio with Best-in-Class and First-in-Class potential to treat patients across a range of immuno-inflammatory diseases. Its lead programme is a series of oral small molecule inhibitors of the α4β7 integrin with the potential to deliver a low dose Best-In-Class α4β7 integrin inhibitor therapy for the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (""IBD"").The Company is in a financially robust position  with a cash balance as at 29 February 2024 of c.£20.8 million  and the potential for further milestone payments upon successful development over the next 18 months.The Company continues to advance its portfolio of early-stage discovery immuno-inflammatory projects towards lead optimisation and develop its pipeline of targets across a range of immuno-inflammatory diseases. With potential to access to greater funding  which the Directors believe will be more easily achieved as a private company  C4X plan to utilise additional resources to pursue multiple opportunities and identify targets with the highest potential to progress novel series into lead optimisation and beyond  thereby providing greater value for shareholders. These projects target clear unmet medical need  combined with significant commercial potential. As C4X progresses its lead programme through the discovery phase towards and potentially into the clinic  with a clear focus on immuno-inflammatory diseases  the Board felt it necessary to address the perceived under-valuation of the business in the public markets and the potential inability to access the future funding that the Board believes is required to allow C4X to flourish as further explained below.3. PROPOSED CANCELLATION AND RE-REGISTRATIONFollowing an extended period of weak share price performance and low liquidity in the Company's shares  the Company has conducted an extensive review of the benefits and drawbacks to the Company retaining the admission of its Ordinary Shares to trading on AIM. The Directors believe that Cancellation is in the best interest of the Company and its Shareholders as a whole. In reaching this conclusion  the Directors have considered the following key factors:lDespite the Company's positive momentum  streamlined portfolio  successful license agreements  focused strategy and robust balance sheet  the Directors believe the current market capitalisation of the Company does not reflect these positive achievements nor the underlying prospects of the business. Consequently  the Directors are of the view that  as a private company  C4X will be able to realise a greater valuation for the Company's programmes  and the business as a whole  which would serve in the best interest of Shareholders.lThe challenging financial market conditions in recent years  combined with a limited free float and lack of liquidity of the Ordinary Shares  has negatively impacted the share price of C4X and therefore its market capitalisation which the Directors believe does not accurately reflect the Company's value.lThe Directors are therefore of the opinion that raising further significant equity through public markets would be challenging in the short or medium term  and potentially may not be at a valuation that is acceptable to Shareholders or at all. Additionally  the Directors believe  admission of the Ordinary Shares to trading on AIM does not  in itself  offer investors the opportunity to trade in meaningful volumes or with frequency within an active market.lThe Directors believe that C4X's growth prospects and ability to execute its immuno-inflammation strategy will be best accomplished as a private company due to:o wider access to a greater pool of investors as a private company who are more likely to support an increased scale of the business and provide opportunity for the creation of increased Shareholder value; ando investors which are likely to include venture capital and specialist investors  who the Directors believe have greater appetite for drug discovery companies such as C4X who do not have regular revenue streams and who are subject to research  development and clinical trial costs and risks.lThe Directors believe re-registering as a private company potentially enables access to a larger quantum of future funding required to accelerate the Company's strategy and facilitate the Company's to drive towards discovery and development inflection points with a view to maximising revenue from its portfolio.lThe considerable cost of maintaining admission to trading on AIM  including fees payable to its professional advisers  including the nominated adviser and broker  AIM fees payable to the London Stock Exchange as well as incremental legal  insurance  accounting and auditing fees  along with the considerable amount of management time and regulatory burden associated with maintaining the Company's admission to trading on AIM are  in the Directors' opinion  disproportionate to the benefits to the Company. The Directors believe the time and cost savings associated with the Cancellation and Re-registration could be better utilised for the benefit of the Company and its Shareholders.lThe Company has obtained indications of support for the Cancellation from its largest shareholders representing 56.2 per cent. of the Company's current issued share Capital. Further details are set out in paragraph 9 of this Part I.Accordingly  the Directors are of the view that the continued admission of the Ordinary Shares to trading on AIM is unlikely to provide the Company with the optimal platform to access further significant capital in the future. As a result of this review and following careful consideration  the Board considers the disadvantages associated with maintaining the admission of the Ordinary Shares to trading to be disproportionately high when compared to the perceived benefits of being listed on AIM and therefore the Board has unanimously concluded that the proposed Cancellation and Re-registration is in the best interests of the Group and its Shareholders as a whole.4. PROCESS FOR  AND PRINCIPAL EFFECTS OF  THE CANCELLATIONThe Company welcomes all Shareholders who wish to remain shareholders of C4X in the event of Cancellation. However  the Directors are aware that certain Shareholders may be unable  or unwilling  to hold Ordinary Shares in a private company in the event that the Cancellation is approved and becomes effective. Such Shareholders may consider selling their Ordinary Shares in the market prior to the Cancellation becoming effective. Alternatively  should the Cancellation become effective  theCompany intends to implement a Matched Bargain Facility with a third party who would facilitate Shareholders buying and selling Ordinary Shares on a matched bargain basis following Cancellation (please refer to paragraph 5 of this Part I of this Document for more detail).Rule 41 of the AIM Rules requires any AIM company that wishes the London Stock Exchange to cancel the admission of its shares to trading on AIM to notify shareholders and to separately inform the London Stock Exchange of its preferred cancellation date at least 20 clear business days prior to such date. In accordance with AIM Rule 41  the Directors have notiﬁed the London Stock Exchange of the Company's intention  subject to the Cancellation Resolution being passed at the General Meeting  to cancel the Company's admission of its Ordinary Shares to trading on AIM on 26 April 2024. Accordingly  if the Cancellation Resolution is passed at the General Meeting  the Cancellation will become effective at 7.00 a.m. on 26 April 2024.If the Cancellation becomes effective  Panmure Gordon will cease to be nominated adviser of the Company pursuant to the AIM Rules and the Company will no longer be required to comply with the AIM Rules however the Company will remain subject to the Takeover Code.Under the AIM Rules  it is a requirement that the Cancellation must be approved via a special resolution by Shareholders holding not less than 75 per cent. of votes cast by Shareholders at the General Meeting. Accordingly  the Notice of General Meeting set out at the end of this Document contains a special resolution to approve the Cancellation.The principal effects of the Cancellation will include the following:las a private company  there will be no formal market mechanism enabling the Shareholders to trade in the Ordinary Shares;lthere will be no formal market quote or live pricing for the Ordinary Shares  therefore it may be more difﬁcult to sell Ordinary Shares compared to shares of companies admitted to trading on AIM (or any other recognised market or trading exchange);lit is possible that immediately following the publication of this Document  the liquidity and marketability of the Ordinary Shares may be significantly reduced and their value adversely affected (however  as set out above  the Directors believe that the existing liquidity in the Ordinary Shares is in any event limited);lthe regulatory and ﬁnancial reporting regime applicable to companies whose shares are admitted to trading on AIM will no longer apply albeit the Company will remain subject to the Takeover Code;llShareholders will no longer be afforded the protections given by the AIM Rules  such as the requirement to be notiﬁed of price sensitive information or certain events and the requirement that the Company seek shareholder approval for certain corporate actions  where applicable  including substantial transactions  reverse takeovers  related party transactions and fundamental changes in the Company's business  including certain acquisitions and disposals; the levels of disclosure and corporate governance within the Company will not be as stringent as for a company quoted on AIM. However  the Company intends to continue to communicate information to Shareholders in the form of newsletters  updates and via the Company website (see below);lthe Company will no longer be subject to UK MAR regulating inside information and other matters;lthe Company will no longer be required to publicly disclose any change in major shareholdings in the Company under the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules;lPanmure Gordon will cease to be nominated adviser to the Company for the purpose of the AIM Rules;lwhilst the Company's CREST facility will remain in place immediately post the Cancellation  the Company's CREST facility may be cancelled in the future and  although the Ordinary Shares will remain transferable  they may cease to be transferable through CREST (in which case  Shareholders who hold Ordinary Shares in CREST will receive share certiﬁcates);lstamp duty will be due on transfers of shares and agreements to transfer shares unless a relevant exemption or relief applies to a particular transfer; and10",neutral,0.02,0.98,0.01,mixed,0.13,0.34,0.53,True,English,"['C4X Discovery', 'Delisting Circular', 'March', '03:15', 'C4X DISCOVERY HOLDINGS PLC', 'other independent ﬁnancial adviser', 'London EC3V 0BT', 'relevant forward-looking statement', 'Broker Panmure Gordon', 'Private Limited Company', 'Nominated Adviser', 'other agent', 'other regulations', 'forward-looking statements', 'Financial Services', 'Markets Act', 'United Kingdom', 'Ordinary Shares', 'voluntary cancellation', 'General Meeting', '40 Gracechurch Street', 'Investor Code', 'share certificate', 'Link Group', 'contact details', 'LinkVote+ app', 'actual results', 'financial position', 'similar expressions', 'undue reliance', 'other person', 'applicable laws', 'securities laws', 'IMMEDIATE ATTENTION', 'The Company', 'registered number', 'UK) Limited', 'Executive Chairman', 'historical facts', 'future events', 'proxy vote', 'AIM Rules', 'new information', 'proxy appointment', 'DOCUMENT', 'doubt', 'contents', 'action', 'advice', 'solicitor', 'accountant', 'purchaser', 'transferee', 'bank', 'stockbroker', 'sale', 'transmission', 'part', 'Directors', 'names', 'page', 'responsibility', 'knowledge', 'belief', 'accordance', 'import', 'England', 'Wales', 'admission', 'Re-Registration', 'Notice', '11.00 a', '15 April', 'offices', 'shareholders', 'signalshares', 'IVC', 'registrar', 'notes', 'comso', '11 April', 'CREST', 'Proxymity', 'completion', 'summary', 'letter', 'purpose', 'entirety', 'recommendation', 'favour', 'Resolutions', 'trends', 'risks', 'uncertainties', 'words', 'project', 'management', 'Readers', 'date', 'obligation', 'respect', 'requirement', 'release', 'publication', 'distribution', 'jurisdictions', 'persons', 'possession', 'restrictions', 'failure', 'violation']",2024-03-27,2024-03-28,marketscreener.com

ESEF (European Single Electronic Format) refers to an xHTML format annual ﬁnancial report in which IFRS consolidated ﬁnancial statements are labelled with XBRL tags.Aspocomp's oﬃcial ESEF-compliant Annual Report 2023 in Finnish has been published in accordance with the ESEF reporting requirements as an xHTML ﬁle and is available at www.aspocomp.com.The audit ﬁrm PricewaterhouseCoopers Oy has provided an independent auditor's reasonable assurance report only on Aspocomp's ESEF Financial Statements in Finnish in accordance with ISAE 3000 (Revised).CEO'S REVIEW2023 was a challenging year for Aspocomp. Full-year net sales decreased by 17 percent to EUR 32.3 million. In the last quarter of the year  net sales decreased by 42 per-cent. e development of net sales was aﬀected by sluggish demand in seve-ral of Aspocomp's customer segments  weakened product mix and  in the last quarter  a temporary process disruption in the company's production.e weak demand situation was particularly reﬂected in the Semiconductor Industry  Telecommunication  and Industrial Electronics customer segments. In the Automotive customer segment  full-year net sales increased when the industry's component shortage eased and customers could be provided with the order book deliveries they had been waiting for. In the Security  Defense and Aerospace customer segment  net sales decreased from the comparison period  but active de-mand in the segment was reﬂected at Aspocomp as an inc-rease in the number of requests for quotations and orders. Order cycles are typically long in the Security  Defense and Aerospace customer segment.Aspocomp's loss-making operating result for the last quarter  EUR 1.8 million  pushed the full-year 2023 operating result to a loss of EUR 1.7 million. e decrease in the operating result was caused by a decline in net sales due to muted demand  the weakened product mix  the recognition of EUR 0.5 million in design costs not included in the usual business in the third quar-ter  and a signiﬁcant rise in material costs. Material costs were increa-sed by a temporary process disruption in production in the last quarter. Material use is estimated to normalize during the ﬁrst quarter of 2024. As-pocomp carried out temporary personnel layoﬀs in the third and fourth quarters in order to adjust costs.As the ﬁnancial year's result remains loss-making  Aspocomp's Board of Directors will pro-pose to the Annual General Meeting that no dividend will be paid for the ﬁnancial year 2023 (EUR 0.21 per share for the ﬁnancial year 2022).ere are already visible signs that the semiconductor market cycle is turning to growth  but the release of high inventory levels in diﬀerent parts of the value chain is happening in stages. erefore  the demand for the company's products is also expected to recover gradually during 2024. In the lon-ger term  the semiconductor industry's growth prospects are still strong as digitization progresses  for example with the spread of artiﬁcial intelligence applications.Inﬂation and interest rates  the economic recession  the uncertainties posed by Russia's war of ag-gression  and global trade policy tensions will aﬀect the operating environment of Aspocompand its customers in the 2024 ﬁscal year. Demand for Aspocomp's products is expected to recover gradually during 2024. We estimate that Aspocomp's net sales for 2024 will increase from 2023 and its opera-ting result improve from 2023. In 2023  net sales amounted to EUR 32.3 and the operating result was a loss of EUR 1.7 million.I would like to express my warm thanks to the company's personnel for their valuable contributi-on and especially for the ﬂexibility and perseverance they have shown in the challenging year of 2023.MIKKO MONTONEN  President and CEOREPORT OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS2023 IN BRIEF• Net sales EUR 32.3 (39.1) million  decrease of 17%• Operating result EUR -1.7 (4.5) million  5.4% (11.5%) of net sales• Earning per share EUR -0.24 (0.52)• Operative cash ﬂow EUR 5.1 (3.6) million• Equity ratio 71.7% (69.4%)• Orders received EUR 21.4 (27.4)  decrease of 22%• Order book at the end of the review period EUR 10.5 (14.3) million  decrease of 27%• Dividend/share EUR 0.00* (0.21)*The Board of Directors proposal to AGMNET SALES AND EARNINGS 2023January-December 2023 net sales amounted to EUR 32.3 (39.1) million  a year-on-year decrease of 17%.e Semiconductor Industry customer segment's net sales decreased by 26% to EUR 11.8 (15.9) million. e de-crease in net sales was due to the delayed recovery of the market and the semiconductor cycle  as well as the high inventory levels in the value chain.e Industrial Electronics customer segment's net sa-les decreased by 35% to EUR 3.6 (5.5) million. Customers have postponed their investment decisions due to the glo-bal economic situation and high interest rates.e Security  Defense and Aerospace customer seg-ment's net sales decreased by 2% to EUR 6.0 (6.1) million. Active demand in the segment was reﬂected at Aspocomp as an increase in the number of requests for quotations and orders  but the order cycles are long  and the results are visible with a delay.e Automotive customer segment's net sales increa-sed by 13% to EUR 7.7 (6.8) million. e customer seg-ment's full-year net sales increased when the component shortage eased in the industry and the company could de-liver orders from the order book to end customers.e Telecommunication customer segment's net sa-les amounted to EUR 3.3 (4.7) million  a year-on-year de-crease of 31%. Customers' investment decisions in mobile networks are postponed due to the global economic situa-tion and high interest rates  and weak demand reduces customers' investments in product development projects.e ﬁve largest customers accounted for 56 (55) per-cent of net sales. In geographical terms  85 (89) percent of net sales were generated in Europe and 15 (11) percent on other continents.e January-December operating result amounted toEUR -1.7 (4.5) million. e decline in the operating result was due to the decreased net sales caused by muted de-mand  the weakened product mix  the recognition of EUR 0.5 million in design costs not included in the usual bu-siness in the third quarter  and a signiﬁcant rise in mate-rial costs. Material costs were increased by a temporary process disruption in production in the last quarter.January-December operating result was -5.4 (11.5) per-cent of net sales.Net ﬁnancial expenses amounted to EUR 0.3 (0.1) mil-lion. Earnings per share were EUR -0.24 (0.52).e order book at the end of the review period was EUR 10.5 (14.3) million. e order book decreased due to the weakened demand caused by the recession and the custo-mers' higher than usual inventory levels.Of the order book  EUR 10.5 million has been schedu-led for delivery this year.INVESTMENTS AND R&DInvestments during January-December 2023 amounted to EUR 2.7 (2.5) million. e investments were focused on upgrading the capacity of the Oulu plant  improving auto-mation  and increasing production eﬃciency.In 2017  Aspocomp launched an investment program to further strengthen its position as a strategic partner to leading companies in the semiconductor  automotive  de-fense and aerospace  and telecommunications (5G) in-dustries. For the second phase of the investment program launched in the spring of 2020  the company was grant-ed development support from the ELY Center for approxi-mately 25 percent of the project's realized total costs. e second phase  which ended in September 2023  aimedin particular at increasing the capacity of the Oulu plant  improved automation and increased production eﬃcien-cy. In the completed investment program  all the new equipment was installed in the existing Oulu plant and no additional plant space was built.CASH FLOW AND FINANCINGJanuary-December 2023 cash ﬂow from operations amounted to EUR 5.1 (3.6) million. Cash ﬂow weakened mainly due to the decrease in working capital.Cash assets amounted to EUR 1.3 (1.4) million at the end of the period. Dividend payment was EUR 1.4 (1.0) million. Interest-bearing liabilities amounted to EUR 2.0 (3.1) million. Interest-bearing liabilities are subject to co-venant terms. e covenant terms were breached in the 2023 ﬁnancial statements  but waiver consents have been obtained from ﬁnanciers. Gearing was 3% (8%). Non-inte-rest-bearing liabilities amounted to EUR 5.4 (6.5) million.At the end of the period  the Group's equity ratio amounted to 71.7% (69.4%).e company has a EUR 4.0 (2.0) million credit facility. Neither the credit facility nor the company's recourse fac-toring agreement was in use at the end of the review pe-riod.DEFERRED TAX ASSETSAt the end of 2023  the company had EUR 4.5 (4.2) million in deferred tax assets in its balance sheet. e deferred tax assets are primarily due to decelerated tax depreciation and losses conﬁrmed in taxation.PERSONNELDuring the review period  the company had an average of 164 (145) employees. e personnel count on December 31  2023  was 163 (156). Of them  106 (100) were blue-col-lar and 57 (56) white-collar employees.e Group's personnel expenses amounted to EUR 9.6 (9.6) million. In addition  the Group booked personnel service costs of EUR 0.6 (0.5) million in 2023.On August 15  2023  Aspocomp started change nego-tiations at the Oulu plant in Finland. e goal of the nego-tiations was to prepare for a partial adjustment of produc-tion to correspond to temporarily low delivery volumes. e negotiations covered most of the Oulu plant's ap-proximately 120 blue-collar employees. e change ne-gotiations ended on August 30  2023  and as a result  the company's plan was to lay oﬀ 20-30 production blue-collar employees at a time for a maximum of 90 days during the six months following the end of negotiations.ENVIRONMENTEnvironmental responsibility is an integral part of As-pocomp's operations  management and decision making  seeking to minimize the company's environmental im-pact. We seek to continuously develop our operations to prevent and reduce the emissions and wastes caused by our operations. We are committed to minimizing the use of materials that have a harmful impact on the environme-nt throughout the whole life cycle of products.Aspocomp manages its environmental compliance with an environmental system that has been certiﬁed in line with the latest version of ISO 14001. e company's environmental system aims to continuously reduce its en-vironmental impact and conserve natural resources. By using the best available and economically viable techno-logies  we strive to cut emissions and to economically use natural resources and energy. Aspocomp complies with the environmental legislation and regulations that are in force as well as seeks to proactively boost the eﬃciency of its operations while taking environmental issues into consideration in all of its functions. Approximately 80% of the company's employees work in ISO 14001-certiﬁed workplaces.In order to achieve the objectives of our environme-ntal system  we constantly train our employees and work in cooperation with our customers  the authorities and ot-her stakeholders. e electronics supply chain has a great impact on the environmental friendliness of the end pro-ducts. erefore  we seek to work closely with other ele-ctronics companies and subcontractors in projects con-cerning the environment and its protection. e goal is to collect reliable data on the composition of the production materials  and to identify the most environmentally friend-ly raw materials and production processes.Aspocomp can provide its customers with detailed ma-terial reports that itemize the chemical elements and com-pounds used in each PCB. Customers can consult these re-ports to determine the recyclability of the ﬁnal product at the end of its life cycle. If necessary  Aspocomp helps its customers organize PCB recycling by utilizing its partners.Aspocomp identiﬁes and assesses the environmental perspectives of its operations at least every other year. e-se reviews are performed by a working group assembled by the oﬃcer responsible for environmental issues. e latest evaluation of environmental perspectives that was carried out focused particularly on reducing the consump-tion of raw materials and the amount of waste generated from production by improving the yields of volume codes. On the basis of the evaluation  the following goals were set for the environmental program in 2022-2024:• Reducing waste and raw material consumption e Oulu plant accounts for most of the company's energy and water consumption and waste. Every year  thecompany provides the national environmental protection information system with data on its use of energy and che-micals  production volumes  water consumption  was-tes generated during operations  and the wastewater load discharged into bodies of water.In 2023  100 percent of the electricity we used came from fossil-free sources. In 2023  the recovery rate of was-te was 58 percent  and waste is reused for the recovery of materials and the production of energy.

Eligible for participation in PSP 2022-2024 are ap-proximately 20 individuals  including the members of As-pocomp's Management Team. e launch of a long-term Performance Share Plan has been announced in a separa-te stock exchange release on July 20  2022.On February 15  2023  Aspocomp Group Plc's Board of Directors decided on the commencement of a new perfor-mance period in the share-based long-term Performance Share Plan (PSP) for the company's senior management and selected key employees. e next plan within the PSP structure  PSP 2023-2025  commenced as of the beginning of 2023 and the share rewards potentially earned thereu-nder will be paid during H1 2026. e new performanceperiod of the long-term Performance Share Plan has been announced in a separate stock exchange release on Feb-ruary 15  2023.OUTLOOK FOR 2024Inﬂation and interest rates  weak economic development  the uncertainties posed by Russia's war of aggression  and global trade policy tensions will aﬀect the operating envi-ronment of Aspocomp and its customers in the 2024 ﬁscal year. e company estimates that the demand in the Semi-conductor segment will gradually recover starting from the ﬁrst half of 2024  while at the same time unloading high in-ventory levels in various parts of the value chain. In order for investments to pick up in several of Aspocomp's custo-mer segments  consumer demand must improve  and in-terest rates decline  among other factors. Demand for As-pocomp's products is expected to recover gradually during 2024.Aspocomp estimates that its net sales for 2024 will inc-rease from 2023 and its operating result will improve from 2023. In 2023  net sales amounted to EUR 32.3 million and the operating result was a loss of EUR 1.7 million.ASSESMENT OF SHORT TERM BUSINESS RISKSIn accordance with its goal  the company has systemati-cally expanded its services to cover the PCB needs of its customers over the entire life cycle and thereby has suc-cessfully balanced out variations in demand and the order book.Risks aﬀecting the operating environmentRussia's war against Ukraine and the sanctions imposed on Russia in response are not expected to have a signiﬁ-cant direct impact on the company. Aspocomp has no bu-siness operations and no direct customers or suppliers in Russia or Belarus. However  the changed operating envi-ronment may aﬀect our sourcing and logistics chains.e geopolitical situation has increased the risks re-lated to customers' global supply chains. Weak econo-mic development  inﬂation and high interest rates cause uncertainty in the operating environment and may aﬀect customer demand and delay customers' investment deci-sions.Cyber risks and disruptions in information systems can aﬀect production. Aspocomp's ability to operate may de-teriorate due to the production interruptions by suppliers or disruptions in the company's production. Disturbances in the labor market can also aﬀect production and delive-ry capacity.Dependence on key customersAspocomp's customer base is concentrated; approximate-ly half of sales are generated by ﬁve key customers. is exposes the company to signiﬁcant ﬂuctuations in de-mand. In addition  variations in the product mix can have a major impact on proﬁtability.Market trendsAlthough Aspocomp is a marginal player in the global ele-ctronics market  changes in global PCB demand also have an impact on the company's business. Competition for quick-turn deliveries and short production series will ac-celerate as the market for PCBs weakens and continues to have a negative impact on both total demand and market prices.Aspocomp's main market area comprises Northern and Central Europe. In case Aspocomp's clients would transfer their R&D and manufacturing out of Europe  demand for Aspocomp's oﬀerings might weaken signiﬁcantly.THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS' DIVIDEND PROPOSALAccording to the ﬁnancial statements dated Decem-ber 31  2023 the parent company's distributable earnings amounted to EUR 6 248 015.53  of which the retained ear-nings were EUR 3 220 736.75.e Board of Directors will propose to the Annual Ge-neral Meeting to be held on April 18  2024  that no divi-dend will be paid.EVENTS AFTER THE FINANCIAL PERIODOn January 4  2024  Aspocomp announced that it will start change negotiations regarding possible temporary layoﬀs and redundancies in Finland. Change negotiations were initiated to improve the company's proﬁtability and com-petitiveness and to secure future operational capacity in a weakened market situation. e company's entire person-nel in Finland  approximately 150 people  were covered by the negotiations.On January 8  2024 Aspocomp announced the changes to the composition of its Management Team.

38272,Euroclear,Bing API,https://tass.com/pressreview/1767055,Press review: EU to walk back asset grab gambit and Russia-North Korea oil flow takes blow,The European Union has opted against transferring 5 bln euros in investment earnings on frozen Russian assets to Kiev; the United States and South Korea are joining forces to prevent Russian-North Korean cooperation in oil supplies;,"In particular  the EU plan calls for using the funds to cover any possible expenses  risks and losses incurred by central securities depositories due to the fighting in Ukraine. Euroclear noted that proceeds earned from the assets for 2022 and 2023 have been ring-fenced from the ""ordinary business"" and will be held ""until receipt of further instructions."" According to Politico  as of February 2024  Russian companies had filed 94 lawsuits in Russian courts against the Euroclear securities settlement and clearing system to demand the release of blocked funds.European Union officials have decided to withhold 5 bln euros in earnings from the investment of frozen Russian assets over two years  but will not give it to Ukraine  Vedomosti writes. Monies earned under the system before February 2  2024  will be held at the Euroclear depository in Brussels to cover the costs of potential litigation in Russia and other countries  according to Politico.MOSCOW  March 28. /TASS/. The European Union has opted against transferring 5 bln euros in investment earnings on frozen Russian assets to Kiev; the United States and South Korea are joining forces to prevent Russian-North Korean cooperation in oil supplies; and Kosovo is on the verge of becoming a member of the Council of Europe  setting off alarm bells in Belgrade. These stories topped Thursday’s newspaper headlines across Russia.Artyom Sokolov  researcher at the Center for European Studies at the Institute of International Studies at Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MGIMO University)  noted that the EU's decision  which was published in the press  reveals a turn toward pragmatic considerations on the part of European politicians  who fear the negative consequences of transferring revenues from Russian assets to Ukraine. Moscow made it clear that such a step would have serious consequences  and this signal has been heard  he told Vedomosti. The EU may simply want to procrastinate for some time  without transferring the funds to Kiev  the expert added. In addition  the EU understands the risks to its own investment appeal should it go ahead with such a provocative treatment of Russian assets  Sokolov noted.In Germany  the news about the EU’s decision to leave the 5 bln euros untouched at Euroclear instead of transferring it to Ukraine did not make the front pages  Vladislav Belov  deputy director of the Russian Academy of Sciences’ Institute of Europe  told Vedomosti. In Moscow's view  every euro cent belonging to Russia that is withdrawn from Euroclear accounts and transferred elsewhere is still a violation and confiscation  since there is no legal basis for such actions. ""Russia's position is as clear as it can be. To paraphrase the Russian president  it can be formulated as follows: you will be forced to swallow bureaucratic dust in the courts "" the expert said. At the same time  it is absolutely unimportant for Russia for what and how its frozen assets are used  and the EU's goals in this regard are absolutely irrelevant  even if we are talking about some [ostensibly] good deeds "" Belov concluded.Washington and Seoul have formed a team of more than 30 officials and intelligence officers to hamper North Korea’s purchases of oil. But  the relevant UN Security Council resolutions do not prohibit the supply of such commodities  only limiting their volume to 4 mln barrels of oil and 500 000 barrels of gasoline per year. The emergency meeting in Washington was called due to the appearance of satellite images of North Korean tankers arriving at the Russian port of Vostochny. This issue may be discussed by the UN Security Council Committee on Sanctions against North Korea  but its functions are purely advisory  Nezavisimaya Gazeta writes.The new body created by Washington and Seoul bears the telltale name ""Enhanced Disruption Task Force "" Reuters writes. Violations pertain to potential shipments of refined oil from Russia to North Korea. Methods for stopping them were discussed  with meeting participants even being issued a statement emphasizing the basic truth that oil is necessary for the North Korean army.There is a possibility that Russia would veto any resolution calling for an extension of the Security Council committee's mandate  New York-based diplomats from countries unfriendly to Russia say. Meanwhile  the committee said that North Korean tankers may have delivered more than 1.5 mln barrels of oil products between January 1 and September 15  2023. At the same time  Washington and Seoul continue to claim that North Korea has supplied Russia with weapons intended for use in military operations in Ukraine. Moscow and Pyongyang have promised to strengthen their military-technical cooperation  but reject allegations of arms supplies  Nezavisimaya Gazeta writes.Konstantin Asmolov  leading researcher at the Institute of China and Modern Asia of the Russian Academy of Sciences  told Nezavisimaya Gazeta: ""The US accusations still need to be proven. Let them do that. As for the North Korea sanctions committee  it has become a tradition that some committee members put forward some crazy ideas  while Russian experts say: ‘We’ll see.’ As a result  as the Americans report  the work of the committee was paralyzed. This happened because it did not automatically crank out resolutions against North Korea.""Shipments of around 150 000 tons of Russian fertilizers are still being blocked in the EU  mostly in Latvia  the press service of major fertilizer producer Uralchem Group told Izvestia. Since 2022  more than 260 000 tons of products from Russia remain in European countries. Uralchem clarified that only about 111 000 tons were exported  mainly from the Netherlands and Belgium  while some are also being held at Estonian ports. Experts believe that the Baltic states are unlikely to cooperate even for the sake of providing humanitarian aid to African countries. At the same time  the EU stated that sanctions against Russia do not apply to the fertilizer sector and do not limit its export to third countries.""At the moment  about 150 000 tons of fertilizers from the Uralchem Group remain in the EU  most of them in Latvia. Uralchem Group is actively cooperating with the UN  represented by the World Food Program  to organize charitable deliveries of these fertilizers to developing countries "" the company's press service told Izvestia.""Estonia and Latvia are completely indifferent to the interests of Africa. They are solving a perfectly understandable problem: to create maximum difficulties for Russia in all areas. If other countries suffer as a result of these actions  it is collateral damage "" Baltic Studies Association President Nikolay Mezhevich told Izvestia.At the same time  the expert suggested that fertilizers stuck in Baltic ports will remain blocked  and Russia should be ready to respond. ""We have to understand that we have apparently lost this property  but we shouldn't make a problem out of it. It is worth looking again carefully for Estonian and Latvian assets registered in second or third hands. Russian citizens are being involved in these schemes "" he added.Humanitarian aid helps reduce food insecurity risks  Andrey Maslov  director of the Center for African Studies at the Higher School of Economics (HSE University)  told Izvestia. ""Russia is playing an increasingly important role in ensuring the security of Africa as a whole  as climate threats have worsened. This not only includes supplies of grain  but also fertilizers. Russia's role will grow in the future  but these humanitarian supplies are only one aspect of our cooperation in the field of food security "" he told Izvestia.On March 27  the Political Committee of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (CoE) approved the admission of partially recognized Kosovo to the CoE. The next step will be a discussion on the admission of Kosovo at a plenary meeting of the organization. The Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe will make the final decision. Dora Bakoyannis  the CoE rapporteur for Kosovo  suggested that participants give a ""positive response"" to Pristina's bid for membership in the CoE.

For the first time  our sales exceeded the EUR 100 million mark  coming to EUR 118 148 thousand (2022: EUR 85 229 thousand). At the same time  we grew profitably in an economically challenging environment  something that is not a matter of course in our sector. This clearly sets us apart from peers.Our order book of EUR 81 300 thousand as of 31 December 2023 (31 December 2022: EUR 74 176 thousand) forms a solid basis for continuing on our profitable growth trajectory as planned. We are proud that our technologies and products remain in demand as they offer an attractive and sustainable value proposition at the highest quality standards to our customers. This way we help our customers to be competitive and to support their efforts to reach long-term decarbonisation targets. Accordingly  order intake in the first few months of the current fiscal year is continuing to grow dynamically. It is particularly worth noting the record order with a total value of approx. EUR 27.8 million gained in the first quarter from a leading international high-tech equipment manufacturer and the last repeat order from Oneberry Technologies in Singapore for reliable energy supply for border protection.Our ambitions remain unchanged in 2024. We are continuing to strengthen our international footprint in the United States  Europe and Asia. By continuously improving the functionality of our products through cloud and IIoT capabilities as well as longer operating times we solidify our competitive position. This year  we expect the strongest growth impetus to come from North America and Asia. Our production facility in India has been completed and is now supplying customers in India. This creates a solid foundation for sustainable expansion both in India and across Asia. We also intend to harness the supply chain potential of the Indian market and the opportunities of the Indian labour market for the benefit of the entire Group.In the US we are experiencing further strong growth and support this via the expansion of our newly established sales  service and logistics centre in Salt Lake City. The integration and further development of our proprietary membrane technology gained from last year’s asset deal with Johnson Matthey in the UK is on track. This will additionally improve key performance features such as the durability and performance of our products  making them even more attractive to our customers. At the same time  we are increasing our vertical integration and reducing external dependencies. All in all  we are rising to new levels in terms of organisation  systems and processes  including a standardised Group-wide ERP system  in order to achieve the forecast growth.”Development of salesIn fiscal year 2023  the SFC Energy Group generated significant sales growth of 38.6% to EUR 118 148 thousand (2022: EUR 85 229 thousand). This gratifying performance in a persistently challenging environment was underpinned by the very sharp increase in sales in the Clean Energy segment  which rose by 37.1% over the previous year  as well as extraordinarily strong organic sales growth of 41.7% in the Clean Power Management segment. Overall  Group sales were thus even higher in 2023 than the forecast range of EUR 115 000 thousand to EUR 117 000 thousand  which had been adjusted upwards in November 2023.Sales by segment in EUR thousand 2023 2022 Clean Energy 79 032 57 632 Clean Power Management 39 116 27 597 Total 118 148 85 229Development of the segmentsThe Clean Energy segment again benefited from strong demand for the Group’s fuel cell solutions in the reporting year  posting a very significant increase of 37.1% in sales to EUR 79 032 thousand (2022: EUR 57 632 thousand). This performance was particularly attributable to energy solutions for industrial applications  which address the core target markets of “civil security technology / video surveillance” and “data transmission and digitalisation”  among others  and accounted for the largest share of segment sales. Demand from the core public security target markets also increased significantly. By contrast  sales of applications in the core target markets for private applications  which contributed the smallest share of segment sales  declined due to general consumer restraint. Sales growth was materially driven by increased contributions from all target regions  particularly North America and Asia. Despite a marginal decline in the reporting year  Clean Energy accounted for the highest sales  with a share of 66.9% (2022: 67.6%).Sales in the Clean Power Management segment also exhibited extremely strong growth of 41.7%  climbing to EUR 39 116 thousand (2022: EUR 27 597 thousand) in the reporting year. In the previous year  segment sales had particularly been characterised by a challenging buy-side environment and supply chain constraints  which eased only gradually in the second half of 2022. The supply chain bottlenecks were almost fully eliminated in the reporting year. Segment sales increased significantly in both Europe and North America thanks to dynamic demand. This is partly due to the continued favourable demand from existing customers in the oil  gas and mining end-customer market  resulting from relatively high crude oil prices and stable market conditions. Clean Power Management accounted for 33.1% of Group sales in the reporting year (2022: 32.4%).Order intake decreased slightly in the reporting year as per balance-sheet date to EUR 124 799 thousand (2022: EUR 127 195 thousand). By contrast  the Group’s order backlog widened significantly to EUR 81 300 thousand as of the reporting date on 31 December 2023 (2022: EUR 74 176 thousand).Development of earningsBoth the growth in sales and the wider gross profit margins in both segments led to a significant increase in gross profit of EUR 15 388 thousand or 49.0% to EUR 46 794 thousand (2022: EUR 31 406 thousand). The resulting gross profit margin for the Group (gross profit as a percentage of revenues) widened significantly to 39.6% (2022: 36.8%).Gross profit for the individual segments compared to the previous year is as follows:Gross profit by segment in EUR thousand 2023 2022 Clean Energy 36 334 24 531 Clean Power Management 10 460 6 875 Total 46 794 31 406EBITDA adjusted for non-recurring effects increased significantly in the reporting year to EUR 15 158 thousand (2022: EUR 8 150 thousand)  thus exceeding the forecast range of EUR 13 000 thousand to EUR 14 100 thousand. The adjusted EBITDA margin improved substantially to 12.8% (2022: 9.6%).EBIT adjusted for non-recurring effects came to EUR 9 696 thousand (2022: EUR 3 157 thousand)  marking a three-fold increase over the previous year  and was therefore also above the target corridor defined by the Management Board (EUR 7 500 thousand to EUR 8 600 thousand). This resulted in a significantly higher adjusted EBIT margin of 8.2% compared to the previous year (2022: 3.7%).The reporting year closed with a significant increase in consolidated net profit for the period of EUR 21 062 thousand (2022: EUR 1 067 thousand). It should be noted that  of this amount  EUR 11 719 thousand is attributable to tax income. In the reporting period  deferred tax assets of EUR 17 416 thousand (2022: EUR 0 thousand) were recognised for tax reduction claims  as it is assumed that it will be possible to utilise existing unused tax losses within a reasonable period of time due to the expected future positive earnings situation. Basic and diluted earnings per share in accordance with IFRS amounted to EUR 1.21 (2022: EUR 0.07) and EUR 1.18 (2022: EUR 0.07)  respectively  in the reporting year.Balance sheetAt 72.6% (31 December 2022: 71.2%)  the equity ratio was above the previous year’s figure. The net financial position (freely available cash and cash equivalents less liabilities to banks) fell moderately to EUR 56 056 thousand as of the 2023 reporting date (31 December 2022: EUR 60 748 thousand). As of 31 December 2023  the SFC Energy Group had 403 permanent employees worldwide (31 December 2022: 354).Cash flow from operating activities before changes in net working capital and income taxes (the operating result before changes in working capital) improved significantly in the reporting year to EUR 15 782 thousand (2022: EUR 8 742 thousand). After allowing for the change in net working capital  which increased by EUR 10 978 thousand in the reporting year (2022: EUR 13 263 thousand)  and income tax payments  a positive cash flow from operating activities of EUR 3 576 thousand was generated (previous year: EUR -4 761 thousand). This substantial increase was mainly due to the considerable increase in the cash flow from operating activities in conjunction with a lower increase in net working capital compared to the previous year.Forecast for 2024Based on the strength of the successful business performance in 2023  the Management Board expects demand for the Group’s fuel cell and power management solutions to continue rising in all regional markets  ensuring that the Group should remain on its growth trajectory in 2024. Significant impetus for growth is expected from North America and Asia in particular.Group salesFor the current financial year  the Management Board expects Group sales to grow year-on-year by around 20% to 30% to roughly EUR 141.7 million to EUR 153.5 million (2023: EUR 118.1 million)  underpinned to a much greater extent by the Clean Energy segment.Adjusted EBITDAThe Management Board projects an increase in adjusted EBITDA to between EUR 17.5 million and EUR 22.4 million (2023: EUR 15.2 million)  thus resulting in a stable to slightly wider EBITDA margin. Further margin expansion is contingent upon the timing of planned growth investments  particularly regional expansion  and the potential impact of increased material and procurement costs. This assumes that the higher costs can be passed on to customers to a certain extent.Adjusted EBITBased on the budgets for the Clean Energy and Clean Power Management segments  the Management Board expects adjusted EBIT for the Group to be between EUR 9.8 million and EUR 14.7 million in 2024 (2023: EUR 9.7 million).

EUR 313 million and EBITDA adjusted for non-recurring effects of approx. EUR 31 millionTargets for 2023 clearly achieved and positive outlook for 2024Very strong ticketing with over 10 million tickets soldSuccessful execution of buy-and-build strategy  set to remain integral to future growthDetlef Kornett appointed sole CEO effective April 2024 – DEAG founder Prof. Peter L.H. Schwenkow to continue to advise the company and remain a shareholderBerlin  28 March 2024 – DEAG Deutsche Entertainment Aktiengesellschaft (“DEAG”) recorded a strong financial performance for the financial year 2023 and – as announced previously – affirming its position at a post-pandemic revenue level surpassing EUR 300 million. The company's growth trajectory has been marked by sustained high profitability  resembling levels seen in the previous year. The positive business performance was achieved organically and without any significant catch-up effects as a result of the coronavirus pandemic  as in the previous year. This development was primarily driven by a strong ticketing business with an increasing share of recurring  predictable revenue as well as the expansion of DEAG’s own event formats and the successful implementation of the buy and build strategy.Preliminary figures for the financial year 2023 indicate revenue of approximately EUR 313 million  compared to EUR 324.8 million in the preceding year and EUR 185.2 million in the pre-pandemic year of 2019.Consolidated revenue before consolidation amounted to approx. EUR 334 million in financial year 2023  compared to approx. EUR 352 million the previous year and around EUR 197 million in financial year 2019. Earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) adjusted for non-recurring expenses amounted to around EUR 31 million. These non-recurring expenses of around EUR 5 million consist of expenses for the EBITDA bonus programme for DEAG executives and employees  which expired at the end of 2023  certain expenses for the successful placement of the new corporate bond 2023/2026  individual items for the preparation of the planned re-listing as well as expenses in connection with the reorganisation of DEAG’s Executive Board. The EBITDA figure of EUR 31 million mirrors that of the previous year  with both years displaying significant improvement over the 2019 figure of EUR 14.1 million. Notably  the key financial figures for 2022 were still affected by catch-up effects from the coronavirus pandemic and funding from coronavirus aid programmes. Looking ahead to financial year 2024  DEAG expects revenue to continue to develop positively  exceeding the forecasts for the growth in percent of the global live entertainment market and a disproportionately high improvement in EBITDA.In the fourth quarter of 2023  DEAG generated revenue of around EUR 100 million and EBITDA was around EUR 13 million  compared to around EUR 90 million and approx. EUR 11.0 million the previous year. The good performance in the fourth quarter was driven in particular by a strong ticketing and Christmas business as well as successful in-house productions. The service business  which includes various services such as production set-up  security and catering  also developed very well as an addition to the value chain in Live Entertainment.DEAG now generates approx. half of its consolidated revenue with its own event formats  for which the majority of tickets are sold via the Group’s own ticketing platforms myticket .de   myticket.at  myticket.co.uk  gigantic.com and tickets.ie. DEAG also achieved its forecast target of over 10 million tickets sold in 2023  after 9 million in 2022. For the current financial year 2024  DEAG expects an increase in tickets sold to around 11.5 million. Ticketing is one of DEAG’s growth drivers and is already making a significant contribution to the overall result. At the same time  it is increasingly profitable itself.DEAG successfully continued its buy and build strategy in the reporting period and increased its stake in its subsidiary I-Motion from 50.1% to 100%. The objective of this strategy is to systematically reduce minority interests following the successful business development of its investments. DEAG also continued its international expansion and entered the Spanish Rock/Pop market. The company has also further strengthened its good market position in the UK by opening a new office in Wales.DEAG is also reorganising its Executive Board: The company founder and CEO of DEAG  Prof. Peter L.H. Schwenkow  has informed the Supervisory Board of DEAG that he will step down as Chairman of the Executive Board on 31 March 2024. After 46 years as CEO  Prof. Schwenkow is thus handing over the leadership role in the Group to Detlef Kornett as planned on his 70th birthday. The former Co-CEO and long-standing member of the DEAG Executive Board will then lead the company as sole CEO with the existing well-established Executive Board team. Peter Schwenkow will be available to the company as “Founder & Senior Advisor” from 1 April 2024 and will continue to be linked with DEAG as a shareholder.With Detlef Kornett (CEO)  Christian Diekmann (COO)  Moritz Schwenkow (CTTO) and David Reinecke (CFO)  DEAG has an experienced Executive Board that will be able to draw on the expertise and network of Prof. Schwenkow as an advisor even after he has stepped down from the Board.Prof. Peter L.H. Schwenkow  CEO and founder of DEAG: “We are once again very pleased with our development in 2023. DEAG has grown into a new dimension over the past two years and will continue on its successful path in an exciting and attractive market. I am proud to be able to continue to accompany its development as a relevant shareholder and advisor in the coming years. The captain is leaving the bridge  but not the ship!”Detlef Kornett  future CEO of DEAG: “We are growing organically and with our buy and build strategy  the success of which we have already impressively demonstrated in recent years. Our ticketing is a dynamic driver of our growth. We are selling a steadily increasing number of tickets via our strong platforms and geneRating high margins. Accordingly  further sales growth and high profitability are our declared goals.”DEAG plans to publish its Annual Financial Report for 2023 on 8 April 2024.About DEAGDEAG Deutsche Entertainment Aktiengesellschaft (DEAG)  a leading entertainment service company and live entertainment provider  produces and promotes live events of all genres and sizes in Europe.

38282,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://www.thetradenews.com/shedding-light-on-deutsche-borses-approach-to-the-dark/,Shedding light on Deutsche Börse’s approach to the dark,As dark trading developments continue to garner speed across European exchanges  The TRADE delves deeper into Deutsche Börse’s upcoming plans for its integrated  synchronised midpoint service.,Encouraged by some of its largest customers  Deutsche Börse’s revival of its midpoint product is set for a November launch  having begun discussions a year ago.The move comes as an increasing number of clients have begun to seek dark offerings from primary exchanges in order to avoid having to go elsewhere – which creates a time delay and subsequent reduction in the efficacy of a trade due to the potential for market impact.Deutsche Börse’s new service – known as ‘Xetra Midpoint’ – offers an integrated solution for German instruments.When using the mid-point service  traders will be able to choose between midpoint orders to trade in the midpoint book only and a dark-lit sweep order.This has a strong use case for price improvement in comparison with aggressive execution in the central limit orderbook  Deutsche Börse’s project manager for Xetra Midpoint  Maximilian Trossbach  asserts.The intention is to build a midpoint trading facility in an order book that is hosted on the same machine as the reference market order book.Read more: Deutsche Börse launches Xetra market close mechanism“We’re building it in a way that it has no disadvantage over the existing standard limit orders  and we also want to make the implementation for our clients as easy as possible ” says Trossbach.“[…] The Xetra lit book is the source for the midpoint that serves as the reference price in the midpoint order book. There is also an order type – the sweep order – where you can check for executions in both books starting in the midpoint and take out everything that’s immediately there. Any remaining quantity then goes into the lit book. That’s the way they are integrated  and we have also built prototypes for the matching algorithm and have tested that  primarily for speed.”Client led developmentAs part of its client-led approach  Deutsche Börse tells The TRADE that applications for new MIC codes for the midpoint order books have been a key focus following client discussions which found them to be the preferred route for trade reporting and order routing logics.All trading will be under the operating MIC of Xetra (XETR) before the deployment of dedicated segment MIC codes for midpoint trading only. The new codes are reserved and set to be published soon following application to the International Organisation for Standardisation (ISO).Read more: European Commission hurries through last minute revision to Mifir text to plug dark trading loopholeThis is a key example of where client demand led product development  Trossbach explains  suggesting there could have been a more simplistic  though admittedly less attractive  approach to pushing Xetra Midpoint live.“We could have simply introduced some flag in the trade notification that tells you ‘this is midpoint’ without using a separate MIC  but clients wanted it  so they get it ” he says.An integrated approachDeutsche Börse’s focus is on having a synchronous service across its dark and lit books in one queue so as to ensure no disadvantage when it comes to using dark-lit sweep for all aggressive flow. Specifically  this means achieving efficacy without sacrificing speed.This however  as the industry is acutely aware  is a technological challenge  in particular as matching logic in midpoint book is more complex than in the lit.Delving into this  Trossbach says: “Minimum acceptable quantity (MAQ) is an additional aspect that you need to consider in the matching. Imagine there is a resting sell order in the midpoint book with an MAQ of 100 shares and a resting buy order with a total quantity of 60  then another buy order comes in with a quantity of 40. We aggregate the two buy orders to be executed against the resting sell order.“This is done by a matching algorithm that seeks the combination of executable orders which maximises the overall executable volume at the given midpoint price and under consideration of individual MAQs.”Currently  Deutsche Börse sees a lot of high frequency trading in its lit book  which becomes tricky to replicate in a dark book environment.“The midpoint book could offer opportunities for slower moving clients who sometimes aren’t able to be first in the queue in our lit book to place a passive order with highest priority when executed against a dark-lit sweep ” explains Trossbach.The potential benefit of Deutsche Börse’s so-called integrated approach is closely linked to the latency arbitrage which exists when it comes to third party venues. Other exchanges  such as Euronext  mirror Deutsche Börse in terms of their set up  where information travels from Bergamo and London  and Frankfurt and London respectively.Recently  Euronext confirmed the launch of its ‘Dark Mid Point Match’ service after relocating its servers to a data centre in Bergamo  in a similar attempt to bridge the latency gap.From his side  Trossbach explains: “There could be private connections that are simply faster. So  if you are not on the fast side of things in the London venue then you might get picked off systematically at prices that are not advantageous for you because your counterparty already knows what the next price will be.“Therefore  we hope that the fact that that we have it as an integrated trading mechanism (literally on the same machine in the same location) will be a key argument for clients to potentially choose our venue.”,neutral,0.06,0.79,0.15,mixed,0.09,0.36,0.55,True,English,"['Deutsche Börse', 'light', 'approach', 'dark', 'Dark Mid Point Match’ service', 'existing standard limit orders', 'Xetra market close mechanism', 'dedicated segment MIC codes', 'reference market order book', 'The Xetra lit book', 'central limit orderbook', 'Deutsche Börse', 'strong use case', 'last minute revision', 'third party venues', 'order routing logics', 'resting sell order', 'overall executable volume', 'two buy orders', 'high frequency trading', 'dark book environment', 'resting buy order', 'dark trading loophole', 'new MIC codes', 'Minimum acceptable quantity', 'Client led development', 'slower moving clients', 'midpoint trading facility', 'dark-lit sweep order', 'midpoint order book', 'market impact', 'new codes', 'executable orders', 'new service', 'reference price', 'dark offerings', 'mid-point service', 'midpoint orders', 'The TRADE', 'operating MIC', 'separate MIC', 'synchronous service', 'order type', 'passive order', 'Xetra Midpoint', 'midpoint book', 'product development', 'client demand', 'lit books', 'largest customers', 'midpoint product', 'increasing number', 'primary exchanges', 'time delay', 'subsequent reduction', 'integrated solution', 'German instruments', 'price improvement', 'aggressive execution', 'project manager', 'same machine', 'remaining quantity', 'client-led approach', 'preferred route', 'International Organisation', 'European Commission', 'Mifir text', 'key example', 'attractive, approach', 'integrated approach', 'aggressive flow', 'technological challenge', 'additional aspect', 'total quantity', 'midpoint price', 'individual MAQs', 'highest priority', 'latency arbitrage', 'Other exchanges', 'data centre', 'similar attempt', 'latency gap', 'private connections', 'client discussions', 'matching algorithm', 'trade reporting', 'trade notification', 'matching logic', 'November launch', 'key focus', 'one queue', 'potential benefit', 'fast side', 'London venue', 'Maximilian Trossbach', 'revival', 'move', 'efficacy', 'traders', 'comparison', 'intention', 'way', 'disadvantage', 'implementation', 'source', 'executions', 'everything', 'prototypes', 'speed', 'applications', 'deployment', 'Standardisation', 'simplistic', 'flag', 'industry', '100 shares', 'combination', 'consideration', 'lot', 'opportunities', 'Euronext', 'terms', 'set', 'information', 'Bergamo', 'Frankfurt', 'servers', 'things', 'prices']",2024-03-28,2024-03-28,thetradenews.com

FY’24 results will be published on May 22nd  2024.FY’25 outlookLooking ahead  Soitec continues to anticipate significant growth in its three end-markets  where it is strengthening its leadership in SOI  and successfully executing on its expansion in compound semiconductors  particularly POI and SmartSiC™. In the short term  Soitec therefore anticipates continued strong performance in FD-SOI  POI and Power-SOI  as well as the start of SmartSiC™ ramp-up.Regarding RF-SOI  the second half of FY’24 benefited from restocking by major customers in anticipation of a smartphone market rebound in 2024  and significant orders from new customers. As already reported in the Q3’24 release the level of RF-SOI inventories at foundries level remains high and will impact the performance of H1 FY’25. However  Soitec starts to see signs of improvement with some inventory digestion downstream at OEMs and at Fabless level.As a result  Soitec expects revenue for FY’25 to be stable at constant exchange rates and perimeter as compared to FY’24 with a potential upside if the RF business recovers earlier  with strong seasonality effect. H1’25 revenue is expected to decline by around 15% year-on-year at constant exchange rates and perimeter  with especially a low point expected in Q1’25. Soitec then expects revenue to rebound in H2’25  driven by the end of RF-SOI inventory correction with foundries  the strong structural growth of its SOI products  the continued adoption of POI and the start of the SmartSiCTM ramp-up in the second half of FY’25. EBITDA1 margin2 for FY’25 is expected to be around 35%.Mid term outlookSoitec expects the RF-SOI inventory correction to end in FY’25  and its long-term growth trajectory to resume rapidly thereafter. It is confident in its growth engines supported by the strong penetration of 5G  the advent of electrification and the acceleration of artificial intelligence  as well as the successful expansion of its product portfolio  in SOI and Compound semiconductors.This expected strong rebound will be driven by the resumption of growth in RF-SOI  the progression of our leadership in SOI products (FD-SOI  Power-SOI  Photonics-SOI)  the continued acceleration of POI  and the significant revenue generated by SmartSiCTM. The group will continue to expand its leadership to new customers and new regions.Soitec will provide guidance on an annual basis and will share a FY’26 guidance at the end of FY’25.# # #AgendaFY’24 Results are due to be published on May 22nd  2024  after market close.Soitec Management will be presenting the results in Paris on May 23rd  2024# # #DisclaimerThis document is provided by Soitec (the “Company”) for information purposes only.The Company’s business operations and financial position are described in the Company’s 2022-2023 Universal Registration Document (which notably includes the 2022-2023 Annual Financial Report) which was filed on June 14th  2023 with the French stock market authority (Autorité des Marchés Financiers  or AMF) under number D.23-0482  as well as in the Company’s 2023-2024 half-year report released on November 15th  2023.

Value8 reports an increase in operating income to 8.2 million euros  whil…,Value8  the investment company listed on Euronext Amsterdam  today publishes its annual results* 2023. Value8 reports an increase in operating income to 8.2 million euros  while the net profit increased to 5.8 million euros. After deducting the dividend on preferent shares  the net profit attributable to ordinary shareholders is 0.57 euro per share.The value of the investment portfolio increased from 100.4 to 109.3 million euros  an increase of 8.9%  supported by a) the net profit and b) the investments in Dealsuite/Brooks (two platforms in M&A of SME companies).Net equity rises by 5.8 percentValue8's net equity rose from 91.9 to 97.2 million euros  an increase of 5.8 percent. NAV per share rose from 8.85 euros (9.03 euros adjusted for the dividend of 0.18 euros) to 9.37 euros  representing an annual return of 5.9 percent.• 83.5 million or 76.4% of the portfolio is invested in listed companies;• 23.3 million Euros or 21.3% of the portfolio is invested in private companies;• Interest-bearing debt amounts to 9.6 million Euros or 8.8 percent of the total balance sheet.The operating income of 8.2 million euro consists of 2.2 million euro dividends received  0.8 million euro interest received  4.3 million euro capital gains on quoted investments  0.4 million euro capital gains on unquoted investments and 0.3 million euro realised gains on investments. Prudent cost management limited total costs to 2.4 million Euros. Of these costs  0.6 million Euros relate to financial expenses.Smallcaps lagged behindIn general  2023 was a good year for equities. However  the stock market rally was dominated by large technology companies and large caps  while the small cap sector lagged behind. Value8 has large positions in four small cap companies (in alphabetical order): Almunda Professionals  Ctac  Morefield and Renewi. Almunda's turnover and EBIT were roughly in line with 2022. Ctac's revenues increased by 8.1%  while profitability was impacted by one-off costs and a lower Q4. Renewi's results are still excellent compared to when we started investing in October 2020. However  the correction in recyclate prices and the lower economic and construction activity will lead to lower net results in the 2023/2024 financial year. The shares of Almunda (+2.3%) and Ctac (-1.5%) were relatively flat in 2023. Renewi's share price rose 11.8% over the year  supported by Macquarie's takeover interest in September 2023. Kersten's excellent operating results were well received by investors. The share price of its parent company Morefield rose 32.9% in 2023 to €0.40.Based on the positive development of Value8's portfolio and the companies in which Value8 invests  Value8 proposes to increase its dividend from EUR 0.18 to EUR 0.19 per share.Value8 will publish its annual report in the second half of April. As Value8's new auditor is subject to a regular inspection process initiated by the Dutch regulator for the 2022 audit  the auditor expects a delay in the audit process for the 2023 annual report. Value8 intends to pay the dividend on its ordinary shares after the AGM has approved the audited accounts.Positive outlookThe companies in which we invest remain focused on profitable growth  supported by organic growth and add-on acquisitions. In addition  the small cap sector is attractively valued on a historical basis. Given the combination of growing companies  a clear sector focus (healthcare  IT) and attractive valuations of small caps  Value8 sees good prospects for long-term value creation.* Preliminary  unaudited results.

This 4 600 sq.m building  which was developed by ARGAN  is Aut0nom®-labelled  i.e. an “in-use Net Carbon Zero warehouse”.DSV is operating this platform through its DSV Road division  as part of a nine-year fixed-term lease. This is the second time that DSV and ARGAN – which already owns the Gennevilliers buildings where the DSV French headquarters are located – work together. DSV is a front-running international company  which delivers transportation and logistics services.Aut0nom®  an in-use Carbon Zero siteA particular attention was given to limiting the site’s carbon footprint. As it is Aut0nom® -labelled  the building is equipped with a rooftop photovoltaic powerplant together with energy storage batteries. This site thus produces its own green energy  covering most of DSV needs. The building’s heating and cooling is ensured by electric heat pumps and lighting by smart LED devices with presence and luminosity sensors. All this equipment helps drastically reduce CO 2 emissions. The remaining part will be compensated for through a reforestation program  led in France. Altogether  the site will be Net Carbon Zero for the in-use phase.The Eslettes site is fully in line with an approach aiming at decarbonating transportation and logistics  currently deployed by the DSV group  which targets ongoing improvement in buildings eco-efficiency.All investments under this project help aim for a BREEAM Very Good certification.Normandie region: a promising territory for ARGANAfter it launched its first projects on the Normandie market  in 2022  when two logistics platforms were delivered near Rouen and Caen  ARGAN is now confirming its interest for this region with this new 4 600 sq.m platform. This site  which is located in the municipality of Eslettes  about fifteen kilometres North of Rouen  and near the junction of the A29 and A151 French highways  is ideally located for the transportation and logistics businesses.Here  the partnership initiated in the “Polen II” business area (“Zone d’Activité Economique”) between ARGAN  the municipality of Eslettes and the Community of municipalities of Inter-Caux Vexin will continue with the development of land reserve on the plot nearby. This piece of land  fully controlled by ARGAN  will help develop a new project for a 16 000 sq.m building for which administrative authorizations are being processed.2024 financial calendar (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)April 2: Net sales of 1 st quarter 2024quarter 2024 July 1: Net sales of 2 nd quarter 2024quarter 2024 July 24: Half-year results 2024October 1: Net sales of 3rd quarter 20242025 financial calendar (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)January 3: Net sales of 4 th quarter 2024quarter 2024 January 16: Annual results 2024March 20: General Assembly 2025About ARGANARGAN is the only French real estate company specializing in the DEVELOPMENT & RENTAL OF PREMIUM WAREHOUSES listed on EURONEXT and is the leading player of its market.

The 49% jump in the projects component is particularly gratifying and reflects our continued commitment and resilience post-pandemic. We have carefully managed our resources  strategically investing in people and skills  which has contributed to these positive results. The uptick in professional services confirms our ability to adapt and respond to market demands. EBITDA  which improved by 34%  is a tangible sign of the efficiency of our management. Noteworthy is the progression in strategic partnerships with global leaders in consulting and technological innovation  such as Bain & Co. and Accenture. The agreement reached with Add Value S.r.l. and the successes in marketing and international trade - 88% of turnover is outside Italy - are key to our development and diversification of our client portfolio. We look to the future with optimism: in the second half of the year  we are focusing on go-to-market activities with our partners  with the aim of further developing turnover and margins. Despite some global uncertainties  I am confident in the growth direction we have taken  supported by the steady increase in recurring revenues.""Verona  March 27  2024. Creactives Group S.p.A. (""Creactives Group"" or the ""Company"") (ISIN IT0005408593 - ticker: CREG)  an international company and Innovative SME  listed on Euronext Growth Milan - Professional Segment (""Euronext Growth Milan Pro"")  that develops Artificial Intelligence technologies to address real-life business problems in the Supply Chain  today approved the consolidated half-yearly report as of December 31  2023  voluntarily subjected to a limited audit  and adopted the quantitative and qualitative criteria of significance of relationships potentially relevant to the assessment of directors' independence  in compliance with the amendments made by Notice No. 43747 published on November 17  2023 by Borsa Italiana S.p.A. to Article 6-bis of the Euronext Growth Milan Issuers' Regulations  which came into effect on December 4  2023 (""Policy""). The Policy is available on the Company's website at www.creactivesgroup.com  ""Investor Relations"" section.It should be noted that the adoption of these criteria  which is not mandatory for issuers listed on EGM PRO  is part of the strategy adopted by the Company to align itself with best practices in corporate governance.As a result of the above  the Board of Directors  in view of the elimination of the burden placed on the Euronext Growth Advisor to assess the independence requirements of candidates for the office of independent director for companies already admitted to Euronext Growth Milan  also took note of the need to eliminate the ""Procedure for obtaining the prior opinion of the Euronext Growth Advisor on the proposed appointment of an independent director"" previously adopted by the Company. Periodic verification of compliance with the criteria will be made when approving the annual financial statements.Comment on the consolidated half-year results as of December 31  2023The value of production amounts to about 3 6 million euros  an increase of about 25% compared to the first half of the previous year. The increase in the value of production is related to a positive increase in recurring revenues (+28%) and the projects component (+49%)  which in the equivalent period of the previous year had been severely affected by delays due to the tail end of the pandemic and the international situation. Internal capitalization decreased from 653 thousand euros to 585 thousand euros given greater use of resources on customer projects.The increase in value of production was followed by an increase in total costs (for personnel and services) of about 18%. This increase is equally distributed between personnel costs and other costs.The increase in personnel costs  amounting to 1 9 million euros as of December 31  2023 (1 6 million euros as of December 31  2022)  is attributable in part to the increases established as provided for in the National Collective Labor Agreements to cope with the substantial increase in inflation and in part to the company's desire to continue to invest in new resources and professionalism.With regard to other costs  increases should be noted for hosting (145 thousand euros vs 90 thousand euros)  costs related to cyber security and compliance (45 thousand euros vs 30 thousand euros) and  with the resumption of international events  spending on trade fairs (140 thousand euros vs 82 thousand euros).In the first half of FY 2023/24  consolidated revenues including WIP amounted to 3 million euros  an increase of 35% compared to the first half of FY 2022/23. Direct revenues increased by 41% from 1 8 million euros to 2 6 million euros. Indirect revenues increased by 4%  from 376 thousand euros to 391 thousand euros.Revenues from sales and services 31.12.2023 % 31.12.2022 % Var. %.

Contributing to this improvement  although limited  were an improvement in EBITDA  an increase in depreciation and amortization  and above all a reduction in taxes  which in the previous year included a provision due to extraordinary events of 323 thousand euros.The group's NFP as of 31/12/2023 was 1 3 million euros (net debt)  up from 532 thousand euros as of 30/06/2023. The recorded change in the net financial position compared to the previous period is due to a decrease in liquidity and a less than proportional increase in short-term financial debt.The recurring part of the business is mainly billed in the later part of the year or at the beginning of the calendar year. Collections  therefore  are concentrated in the first calendar quarter  and so the comparison with June suffers from this factor.In addition  the net financial debt  is also strongly influenced by the turnover related to new projects that developed more from Q2 with a shift of cash flow in the second half of the year.Cash was 386 thousand euros as of December 31  2023 compared to 851 thousand euros as of June 30  2023.Shareholders' equity was 1 2 million euros.On the business front  the development of partnerships with leading global advisory and technology companies continued with determination. Agreements with INDRA  KPMG and NTT DATA were joined by further important agreements with Accenture and Bain & Co.The collaboration with Add Value S.r.l. achieved its goal with the creation of the new business intelligence application and its release at the first international client  allowing Creactives to focus on its core business. In addition  using Add Value resources  a major reengineering of the TAM4 platform was completed  which will reduce the time for customizations and setup projects.The sales and marketing effort continued with major successes globally  confirming the clear dominance of international business over domestic business.Significant events that occurred during the six-month reporting period and thereafter and significant events that occurred between the end of the six-month reporting period and the publication of this press releaseSeptember 21  2023Creactives S.p.A.  the operating subsidiary  and Accenture (NYSE: ACN) have signed a strategic agreement to help clients leverage the power of Creactives' AI to deliver value through data in less time.September 29  2023Creactives S.p.A. with the BSI (British Standards Institute) audit visit conducted during September has obtained the following important international certifications that testify to the quality with which the company operates:ISO27017: ISMS (Information Security Management System) for managing information security in the CLOUD (new certification)ISO27018: System for secure management of personal information in public cloud acting as PII processor - Management System for protection of PII (Personal Indentifiable Information) in public cloud acting as PII processor (PII on cloud for data processor) (new certification)ISO27001: System for secure information management - Information Security Management System (renewal)ISO9001: Quality Management System supporting ISO9001 requirements (renewal)October 25  2023The ordinary shareholders' meeting of Creactives Group has:approved the financial statements as of June 30  2023 as proposed by the Board of Directors and took note of the Group's consolidated financial statements as of June 30  2023 and resolved to carry forward the loss for the year of 435.736 euros;approved the request for delisting from the multilateral trading system of the Vienna Stock Exchange on which the Company is likewise listed  empowering the Chairman of the Board of Directors  with the power to sub-delegate to third parties  including those outside the Board  to take care of all the necessary steps and formalities to complete the aforementioned process;appointed the new Board of Statutory Auditors drawn from the only list submitted by shareholder Paolo Gamberoni.November 23  2023Creactives was named to the ""ProcureTech 100"" list and Spend Matters' ""50 to Watch"" list as a cutting-edge solution in the field of Artificial Intelligence applied to Procurement. Created by ProcureTech  in association with Kearney  the ""2023 ProcureTech100"" is the list of the 100 most cutting-edge digital procurement solutions on the planet.November 29  2023Creactives Group S.p.A. announces that  following the shareholders' resolution of October 25  2023 by which the request for delisting from the Vienna Stock Exchange's multilateral trading system was approved  all the necessary steps and formalities to conclude the aforementioned process have been completed as of the date.The last day of trading of the Company's ordinary shares on the Direct Market of the Vienna Stock Exchange was December 22  2023.Foreseeable development of operationsDuring the second half of the fiscal year  the company will continue with the priorities already highlighted in the strategic plan; in particular  it will focus on go-to-market activities together with partners.From this joint action in the market  the company expects a major contribution to growth in terms of sales and margins  growth that was expected in the first part of the fiscal year but which  due to delays in finalizing some contracts with large customers  has slipped by about six months.The company will also continue to invest in its AI (Artificial Intelligence) technology  both on the Vanessa platform and applications  thanks in part to the collaboration with Add Value S.r.l.In fact  both our primary international clients and partners are pushing us to expand and enrich our current business use cases. In this context  while confirming the willingness to start a path of investment  also for a greater integration of products with the SAP world  this specific development has been rescheduled for the next financial year  giving priority to the development of functionalities that simplify the use of our technology  both in the setup phase and in the subsequent use by customers.The company is further developing its presence to major European companies in new industries  especially with the establishment of solutions dedicated to warehouse management and ""master data"". It is also beginning to seize opportunities outside the European market  particularly on the American continent.Despite the uncertainties that remain at the level of the international geopolitical and financial situation  the company nevertheless remains positive on its growth path  albeit with some delays  mainly due to the steady increase in recurring revenues.The financial statements are attached.DOWNLOAD THE PRESS RELEASE (EN)DOWNLOAD THE PRESS RELEASE (IT)",neutral,0.06,0.93,0.01,mixed,0.47,0.15,0.38,True,English,"['Creactives Group S.p.A.', 'Creactives S', 'half-yearly report', 'Board', 'Directors', 'consolidated', '31 December', 'March', '12:55', 'Borsa Italiana S.p.A.', 'Add Value S.r.l.', 'Creactives Group S.p.A.', ""Euronext Growth Milan Issuers' Regulations"", 'Main consolidated economic highlights', 'Main consolidated financial highlights', 'solid trust customers place', 'consolidated half-yearly report', ""EGM Issuers' Regulations"", 'annual financial statements', 'Euronext Growth Advisor', 'Investor Relations"" section', 'Artificial Intelligence technologies', 'real-life business problems', 'ANNUAL RECURRING REVENUE', '1st half FY', 'subscription-based customers', 'growth direction', 'EGM PRO', 'Recurring revenues', 'recurring nature', 'second half', 'first half', 'international partnerships', 'NET DEBT', 'subscription contracts', 'Paolo Gamberoni', 'supply chain', 'projects component', 'continued commitment', 'positive results', 'professional services', 'market demands', 'tangible sign', 'strategic partnerships', 'global leaders', 'technological innovation', 'international trade', 'client portfolio', 'market activities', 'global uncertainties', 'Innovative SME', 'Professional Segment', 'limited audit', 'Notice No.', 'best practices', 'corporate governance', 'independence requirements', 'independent director', 'prior opinion', 'Periodic verification', 'half-year results', '3,6 million euros', 'equivalent period', 'tail end', 'international situation', 'Internal capitalization', '653 thousand euros', '585 thousand euros', ""directors' independence"", 'remarkable 28% increase', 'steady increase', 'positive increase', 'qualitative criteria', 'total revenues', 'International turnover', 'Continued development', 'previous year', 'international company', '25% growth', 'quantitative', 'significance', 'relationships', 'assessment', 'Article', 'bis', 'production', 'agreements', 'Bain', 'Accenture', 'SALES', 'WHICH', 'ARR', 'DEC.', '88% SHARE', 'EBITDA', 'LOSS', '879K', '31 December', '30 June', 'PFN', 'Work', 'Progress', 'WIP', 'Chairman', 'Board', 'expertise', '49% jump', 'resilience', 'pandemic', 'resources', 'people', 'skills', 'uptick', 'ability', 'efficiency', 'management', 'consulting', 'Co.', 'successes', 'marketing', 'Italy', 'diversification', 'future', 'optimism', 'aim', 'margins', 'Verona', 'March', 'ISIN', 'ticker', 'CREG', 'compliance', 'amendments', 'November', 'effect', 'Policy', 'website', 'creactivesgroup', 'adoption', 'strategy', 'view', 'elimination', 'burden', 'candidates', 'office', 'companies', 'note', 'need', 'Procedure', 'appointment', 'Comment', 'delays']",2024-03-27,2024-03-28,marketscreener.com

If you are in any doubt about the action you should take  you are recommended to immediately seek your own personal ﬁnancial advice from your stockbroker  bank manager  solicitor  accountant or other independent professional ﬁnancial adviser who  if you are taking advice in Ireland  is authorised or exempted pursuant to the European Union (Markets in Financial Instruments) Regulations 2017 of Ireland (as amended) or the Investment Intermediaries Act 1995 of Ireland (as amended)  or  in the case of shareholders in the United Kingdom  a ﬁrm authorised under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 of the United Kingdom (as amended). This Circular relates to the UK Delisting Resolution to be voted on at the Annual General Meeting of FBD Holdings plc.If you have sold or transferred all of your registered holding of FBD Holdings plc shares  please forward this document and the accompanying Form of Proxy to the purchaser or transferee  or to the stockbroker  bank or other agent through or by whom the sale or transfer was eﬀected  for delivery to the purchaser or transferee. If you sell  or have sold  or otherwise transferred  only part of your holding of FBD Holdings plc shares  you should retain these documents and consult the stockbroker  bank or other agent through whom the sale or transfer was eﬀected.Letter from the Chairman in relation to the Annual General Meeting27 March 2024Dear Shareholder The Notice of the Annual General Meeting of FBD Holdings plc (the ""Company"" or ""FBD"")  which will be held at 11.00 a.m. on 9 May 2024 in The Irish Farm Centre  Bluebell  Dublin 12  follows this letter on pages 5 to 8.I want to set out in this letter details of the business to come before the meeting.Resolution 1 deals with the consideration of the Financial Statements of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2023.Resolution 2 deals with the declaration of a dividend on the 14% non-cumulative preference shares for the year ended 31 December 2023. A dividend cannot be declared on the ordinary shares unless and until the dividend on the 14% preference shares has been declared.Resolution 3 deals with the declaration of a dividend on the 8% non-cumulative preference shares for the year ended 31 December 2023. A dividend cannot be declared on the ordinary shares unless and until the dividend on the 8% preference shares has been declared.Resolution 4 deals with the declaration of a ﬁnal dividend of 100 cent per ordinary share for the year ended 31 December 2023.Resolution 5 asks shareholders to receive and consider the Report on Directors' Remuneration. This Report is set out on pages 111 to 131 of the Annual Report. The resolution is an advisory non-binding resolution  and it is the Company's practice to put this to a shareholder vote each year.Resolution 6 deals with the proposed re-election of each of the Directors who are putting themselves forward for re-election. It is the Company's practice that all Directors continuing in oﬃce will submit themselves for re-election at each Annual General Meeting. Biographies of all the Directors proposed for re-election are set out on pages 67 to 70 of the Annual Report in the Report of the Directors.1Pages 107 and 108 of the Annual Report outlines the balance of skills and experience that the Board has identiﬁed as critical to its composition at this time and to the Group's long term sustainable success. A formal evaluation of the performance of each Director has been undertaken. I can conﬁrm that each Director continues to contribute and perform eﬀectively and demonstrates commitment to their role as Director.Resolution 7 is a standard resolution which authorises the Directors to ﬁx the remuneration of the Auditors.Resolution 8 will be proposed as an Ordinary Resolution to renew the Directors' authority under Section 1021 of the Companies Act 2014 to allot shares up to an aggregate nominal value of €7 037 072 (representing approximately 33% of the issued ordinary share capital (excluding treasury shares) as at 27 March 2024 being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this letter).The total number of treasury shares held by the Company as at 27 March 2024 is 164 005 representing 0.46% of the total issued ordinary share capital (excluding treasury shares).The Board currently has no intention to issue shares pursuant to this authority except for issues of ordinary shares under the Company's employee share schemes or share incentive plans and the Board will only exercise this authority if it considers it to be in the best interests of shareholders generally at that time. This authority  if renewed  will expire on the earlier of the date of the next Annual General Meeting of the Company or 9 August 2025.Resolution 9 will be proposed as a Special Resolution to renew the Directors' authority to issue shares for cash other than strictly pro-rata to existing shareholdings in certain circumstances being  (a) in speciﬁc circumstances relating to rights issues  (b) any other issue of shares for cash and is limited to an aggregate nominal value of €1 066 223 (representing approximately 5% of the Company's issued ordinary share capital (excluding treasury shares) as at 27 March 2024 being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this letter) and/or (c) the allotment of equity securities pursuant to theCompany's employee share schemes or share incentive plans for the time being in force.The Board currently has no intention to issue shares pursuant to this authority except for issues of ordinary shares under the Company's employee share schemes or share incentive plans and the Board will only exercise this authority if it considers it to be in the best interests of shareholders generally at that time. This authority  if renewed  will expire on the earlier of the date of the next Annual General Meeting of the Company or 9 August 2025.Resolution 10 will be proposed as a Special Resolution to authorise the Directors to issue shares for cash other than strictly pro-rata to existing shareholdings. The proposed authority is limited to (a) the allotment of shares for cash up to an aggregate nominal value of €1 066 223 (representing approximately 5% of the Company's issued ordinary share capital (excluding treasury shares) as at 27 March 2024 being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this letter); and (b) will only be used in connection with an acquisition or other capital investment of a kind contemplated by the Pre-Emption Group's Statement of Principles (the ""PEG Principles"") which is announced contemporaneously with the allotment  or has taken place in the preceding twelve-month period and is disclosed in the announcement of the allotment.The maximum nominal value of equity securities which could be allotted if both authorities proposed by Resolutions 9 and 10 were used in full would be €2 132 446 which represents approximately 10% of the Company's issued ordinary share capital (excluding treasury shares) as at 27 March 2024.In respect of the authorities being sought under Resolutions 9 and 10  the Directors acknowledge the provisions of the most recent PEG Principles published in November 2022. Resolutions 9 and 10 reﬂect the template resolutions and the Directors conﬁrm that the Company will follow the principles set out in the PEG Principles. The Board has proposed a limit of 5% of the issued share capital of the Company (excluding treasury shares) in Resolution 9  and have opted to seek a further 5% for an acquisition or speciﬁed capital investment in Resolution 10  rather than the higher threshold of 10% set out in the most recent PEG Principles in each case  as the Directors believe that provides suﬃcient ﬂexibility to the Company at this time and will keep this under review in future years.The Board currently has no intention to issue shares pursuant to this authority and the Directors will exercise these authorities only if they consider them to be in the best interests of shareholders generally at that time. These authorities will expire on the earlier of the date of the next Annual General Meeting of the Company or 9 August 2025.Resolution 11 will be proposed as a Special Resolution to renew the authority  the renewal of which is usually sought every year  for the Company  or any subsidiary of the Company  to make market purchases of the Company's ordinary shares up to 10% of the aggregate nominal value of the Company's issued share capital with voting rights. The text of the resolution sets out the minimum and maximum prices which may be paid for ordinary shares purchased in this manner.The total number of conditional awards over ordinary shares in the Company outstanding on 27 March 2024 is 963 213 representing 2.38% of the issued share capital with voting rights on that date. If the Directors were to exercise the authority being renewed by this resolution up to the maximum allowed and to cancel such shares and all other shares held in treasury  these conditional awards would represent 2.65% of the issued share capital with voting rights (excluding treasury shares).The Board will only exercise this authority if it considers it to be in the best interests of shareholders generally at that time.This authority  if renewed  will expire on the earlier of the date of the next Annual General Meeting of the Company or 9 August 2025.Resolution 12 will be proposed as a Special Resolution to set the price ranges at which the Company may re-issue treasury shares oﬀ-market.The Board will only exercise this authority if it considers it to be in the best interests of shareholders generally at that time. This authority  if renewed  will expire on the earlier of the date of the next Annual General Meeting of the Company or 9 August 2025.Resolution 13 will be proposed as a Special Resolution to maintain the existing authority in the Company's Articles of Association which permits the convening of an Extraordinary General Meeting of the Company on 14 days' notice where the purpose of the meeting is to consider an Ordinary Resolution only.Resolution 14 will be proposed as a Special Resolution to authorise the Directors to apply for the cancellation of the listing of the Company's ordinary shares from the premium segment of the Oﬃcial List of the Financial Conduct Authority and to remove such ordinary shares from trading on the London Stock Exchange plc's Main Market for listed securities (the ""UK Delisting Resolution""). As the UK Delisting Resolution only impacts the listing of the Company's ordinary shares  only holders of ordinary shares are permitted to vote on the UK Delisting Resolution. Holders of the Company's 8% preference shares and 14% preference shares have conﬁrmed to FBD Holdings plc that they will abstain from voting on the UK Delisting Resolution.The Company's ordinary shares are  in Ireland  admitted to a primary listing on the Oﬃcial List maintained by Euronext Dublin and admitted to trading on the Main Market of Euronext Dublin and  in the UK  admitted to the premium segment of the Oﬃcial List maintained by the FCA and to trading on the Main Market for listed securities of the London Stock Exchange. The Board continually keeps the Company's listing arrangements under review. The Board has noted that in recent years the volume of trading in the ordinary shares on the London Stock Exchange is negligible as a percentage of the overall trading volume in the ordinary shares.Consequently  the Board considers that the cost of maintaining such a listing is no longer in the interests of the Company and its shareholders as a whole. The Company will maintain the primary listing of its ordinary shares on the Main Market of Euronext Dublin.The FCA Listing Rules require the UK Delisting Resolution to be passed at the Annual General Meeting in order to enable the Company to proceed with the UK Delisting.Your attention is drawn to the Appendix to this letter which includes further details in relation to the UK Delisting Resolution. You should read this Appendix in its entirety and consider whether or not to vote in favour of the UK Delisting Resolution in light of the information contained in the Appendix.Form of ProxyThose shareholders unable to attend the Meeting may appoint a proxy.

HOLDINGS PLC TO THE HOLDERS OF ORDINARY SHARESIN CONNECTION WITH THE PROPOSED UK DELISTING(incorporated and registered in Ireland with registered number 135882)27 March 2024Dear Shareholder Proposed cancellation of admission to the premium segment of the Oﬃcial List maintained by the FCA and to trading on the Main Market for listed securities of the London Stock Exchange1. INTRODUCTION On 8 March 2024  the Company announced that it was considering a proposal to cancel the admission of its ordinary shares to the Oﬃcial List of the FCA and to trading on the London Stock Exchange's Main Market for listed securities and if simpliﬁcation of the listing structures would be beneﬁcial for FBD. On 27 March 2024  the Company announced that  following shareholder feedback  the UK Delisting Resolution will be proposed at the Company's Annual General Meeting. The primary listing of the Company's ordinary shares on the Main Market of Euronext Dublin will not be aﬀected by the UK Delisting Resolution. The FCA Listing Rules require the UK Delisting Resolution to be passed at the Annual General Meeting in order to enable the Company to proceed with the UK Delisting. The Annual General Meeting is to be held at The Irish Farm Centre  Bluebell  Dublin 12  Ireland on 09 May 2024 at 11.00 a.m. A copy of the Notice of Annual General Meeting accompanies this Appendix (""Notice of Annual General Meeting of FBD Holdings plc""). Should the UK Delisting Resolution be approved by Shareholders  it will authorise the Board to request that: (i) the FCA cancel the listing of the Company's ordinary shares on the Oﬃcial List; and (ii) the London Stock Exchange remove the ordinary shares from trading on the Main Market. The purpose of this Appendix is to explain the background to  and reasons for  the proposed UK Delisting  the implications for Shareholders of the proposed UK Delisting and why the Board believes the UK Delisting to be in the best interests of the Company and its Shareholders.2. BACKGROUND TO THE PROPOSED UK DELISTING The Company is a public company limited by shares incorporated in Ireland. The Company's ordinary shares are  in Ireland  admitted to a primary listing on the Oﬃcial List maintained by Euronext Dublin and admitted to trading on the Main Market of Euronext Dublin and  in the UK  admitted to the premium segment of the Oﬃcial List maintained by the FCA and to trading on the Main Market for listed securities of the London Stock Exchange. The Board continually keeps the Company's listing arrangements under review. The Board has noted that in recent years the volume of trading in the ordinary shares on the London Stock Exchange is negligible as a percentage of the overall trading volume in the ordinary shares. Consequently  the Board considers that the cost of maintaining such a listing is no longer in the interests of the Company and its Shareholders as a whole. Accordingly  the Board has resolved to propose the UK Delisting Resolution at the AGM.3. REASONS FOR THE UK DELISTING The Board has decided to seek Shareholders' approval for the UK Delisting for the following reasons: ● an increasingly smaller proportion of the trading in the Company's ordinary shares is conducted on the London Stock Exchange over the course of the last number of years to the extent that the volume of trade on the London Stock Exchange currently constitutes a very small portion of the overall trade between the two trading lines particularly compared to the volume traded on Euronext Dublin (by way of illustration  less than 2 per cent of FBD's average total volume traded was conducted on the London Stock Exchange over the last 12 months); ● in that context  the cost and the legal and regulatory burden associated with maintaining admission of the ordinary shares to trading on the London Stock Exchange is  in the Board's opinion  disproportionate to the beneﬁts to the Company and its Shareholders;10",neutral,0.02,0.94,0.04,mixed,0.33,0.35,0.32,True,English,"['UK Delisting Resolution', 'FBD', 'March', '01:13', 'other independent professional ﬁnancial adviser', 'long term sustainable success', 'The Irish Farm Centre', 'next Annual General Meeting', 'FBD Holdings plc shares', 'personal ﬁnancial advice', 'aggregate nominal value', 'employee share schemes', 'Financial Instruments) Regulations', 'Investment Intermediaries Act', 'latest practicable date', 'speciﬁc circumstances', '14% non-cumulative preference shares', '8% non-cumulative preference shares', 'ordinary share capital', 'UK Delisting Resolution', 'advisory non-binding resolution', 'other agent', '14% preference shares', '8% preference shares', 'ordinary shares', 'Financial Services', 'Financial Statements', 'Companies Act', 'The Board', 'Annual Report', 'treasury shares', 'ACCOMPANYING FORM', 'IMMEDIATE ATTENTION', 'European Union', 'United Kingdom', 'Dear Shareholder', 'shareholder vote', 'oﬃce', 'formal evaluation', 'incentive plans', 'best interests', 'existing shareholdings', 'Markets Act', 'Ordinary Resolution', 'registered holding', 'total number', 'standard resolution', 'Special Resolution', 'bank manager', 'ﬁnal dividend', ""Directors' Remuneration"", ""Directors' authority"", 'CIRCULAR', 'PROXY', 'doubt', 'action', 'stockbroker', 'solicitor', 'accountant', 'Ireland', 'case', 'shareholders', 'ﬁrm', 'document', 'purchaser', 'transferee', 'sale', 'delivery', 'part', 'Letter', 'Chairman', 'relation', 'March', 'Notice', '11.00 a', '9 May', 'Bluebell', 'Dublin', 'pages', 'details', 'business', 'consideration', 'year', 'declaration', '100 cent', 'practice', 'election', 'Biographies', 'balance', 'skills', 'experience', 'composition', 'time', 'Group', 'performance', 'commitment', 'role', 'Auditors', 'Section', 'publication', 'intention', 'issues', '9 August', 'cash']",2024-03-27,2024-03-28,marketscreener.com

APPROVED DRAFT FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF DECEMBER 31  2023 AND CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 2023Revenues: €62.7 million (+6.4% vs FY 2022  +7.0% at constat FX rates)Gross Profit: €38.7 million (61.7% Gross margin) vs €36.8 million in FY 2022EBITDA: €9.6 million (15.4% EBITDA margin) vs €11.7 million in FY 2022Net Income: €4.8 million (7.7% on Revenues) vs €7.5million in FY 2022Net Financial Position: €3.2 million vs €4.4 million as of December 31  2022Ronco Scrivia (GE  Italy)  March 27  2024 - The Board of Directors of Racing Force S.p.A. (""Company"" or ""RFG"")  the parent company of Racing Force Group  which is specialized in the development  production and marketing of safety components for motorsports competitions worldwide  as well as listed on the Euronext Growth Milan (RFG) and Paris segments (ALRFG)  reviewed and approved the draft financial statements as of December 31  2023 and the consolidated financial statements for 2023  prepared in accordance with international accounting standards.Paolo Delprato  Chairman and CEO of Racing Force Group  commented: “This fiscal year has been characterized by significant investments aimed at further strengthening the organizational structure of the Group and increasing production and logistical capacity  to support the expected growth in the coming years  both in motorsport and as a result of diversification projects currently under implementation. The investment plan launched at the end of 2022 is progressing and is set to be completed by Q1 of the next fiscal year  positioning the Group ready to seize the significant opportunities which are emerging.Despite a macroeconomic context marked by strong uncertainty  with high inflation rates and credit restrictions that did not support market demand  during 2023 the Group managed to achieve significant results  particularly in Europe  Asia  and Oceania. In the United States  some primary dealers adopted destocking policies during the year  which affected sales  mainly in the second half of the year. Nevertheless  the Group was able to increase its market share  even in the American market  where we expect significant growth over the next few years  thanks to the strengthening strategy implemented.The level of orders collected in the first quarter of 2024 on a global scale  marking an unprecedented peak  confirms our growth expectations for the current season.The implemented strategies and the continuous commitment of all the people at Racing Force  starting from our technicians within the R&D laboratories at the main headquarters of the Group  will enable to achieve increasingly significant results in the upcoming periods”.Summary of Group Results as of December 31  2023Group's Revenues amount to €62.7 million  up compared to fiscal year 2022 (+6.4% at current FX rates and +7.0% at constant FX rates).The increase characterized particularly the geographical areas of EMEA (+11.2%) and APAC (+15.0%)  while the Americas recorded a decline (-7.8%)  mainly due to a one-off supply to a customer outside motorsport carried out during the previous year  and due to the weaking of the dollar against euro. Excluding these effects  growth in Americas would be of 4.6%.Dealers are confirmed as the primary sales channel for the Group (62.1% of revenues)  while Driver's Equipment represents the main category in terms of product type (71.9 % of revenues)  thanks to the increase recorded by all the main racewear products offered by the Group.EBITDA amounted to €9.6 million (EBITDA margin 15 4%)  against €11.7 million in 2022 (EBITDA margin 19.8%). The variance is mainly due to higher costs incurred during 2023 to support the growth in Motorsport and  mostly  the investments and the diversification projects currently under implementation.EBIT was €6.3 million (10.0% EBIT margin)  against €8.8 million (15.0% EBIT margin) in fiscal year 2022.Net income was €4.8 million (7.7% of Revenues)  against €7.5 million (12.8% of Revenues) in fiscal year 2022.The Group's Net Financial Position passed from a net debt of €4.4 million at the end of 2022  to a balance of €3.2 million as of December 31  2023  also thanks to the share capital increase completed in January 2023  in addition to the cash generated during the period from operations  net of the investments made during the fiscal year.Performance AnalysisThe global economy decelerated in 2023  mainly due to high inflation and restrictions in financing conditions. The strong geopolitical uncertainty  caused by the conflict between the Russian Federation and Ukraine and  starting from the end of 2023  also by the conflict between Israel and Palestine  further worsened the market environment.In this scenario  the Group recorded +6.4% growth in sales during the year  compared to the previous period (+7.0% at constant exchange rates)  thanks particularly to the excellent results achieved on the European market (+11.2%) and the continuous growth in Asia Pacific (+15.0%)  regions where the Group has further consolidated its leadership position and which represent 76% of the Group's total sales.Even in the Americas  despite lower sales compared to the previous year  due to a one-supply made in 2022 and weak demand coupled with the destocking policies implemented by some dealers during 2023  the Group increased its market share.The increase in revenues during the fiscal year was mainly due to the driver's equipment product category  driven by the increase in sales of racing suits  non-technical apparel and communication systems.Gross profit registered an increase in absolute value of €1.9 million compared to fiscal year 2022. In percentage terms  a slight decrease of 0.8% was recorded  mainly due to the different composition of the mix of sales and the volatility in the costs of some raw materials.During the fiscal year  the Group made significant investmentsto increase production and logistics capacity to support the growth within motorsport and  particularly  to carry on the diversification projects  currently underway.General and administrative expenses  in detail  registered an increase of €2.7 compared to 2022  mainly due to the higher number of employees within the Group (+90 units employed on average during 2023 compared to the previous year).This increase was necessary in order to timely set up the proper organizational structure and production capacity  required to support both the activities within motorsport and the diversification projects.The current capital structure is such as to allow investments in the coming future to further support the Group's growth plan  both within motorsport and as regards the diversification projects.Current tradingSales at the beginning of 2024 are in line with the previous year  maintaining stability in the main geographic areas of operation  except for non-technical apparel under the Racing Spirit brand which registered a decrease compared to the first months of 2023  mainly due to the deliveries made at the beginning of the previous year to two important customers covering the entire season.Orders received from customers in the first months of the year increased significantly compared to the same period of the previous year.The approval of a new FIA safety standard for helmets  effective upon the first homologation of a compliant model by a manufacturer  entails the risk of potential effects on demand in the first part of 2024  particularly from dealers  waiting for the new models  with the expectation of a strong acceleration in sales once the new homologated helmets will be available. For this reason  the development of helmets compliant with the new standard  with the aim of having a large quantity in stock by the end of 2024  is a crucial element to achieve the growth targets set for the Bell brand and gaining new market share. To date  testing activities underway at the R&D center in Bahrain  which is unique in the competitive landscape  are particularly positive.In addition  a new Snell homologation standard for helmets distributed on the US market is scheduled to come into force in autumn 2025. The introduction of new safety standards has always been a technological challenge and  at the same time  an important growth opportunity for the Group.With reference to other main product categories  both Car parts and Driver's Equipment are expected to benefit from the technical partnership agreement in place for the season  starting with the new agreement signed at the beginning of the year with Penske Team  one of the main American teams racing in Nascar and Indycar.Following the consolidation of the Group's structure during 2023  to support the expected growth in motorsport and with the aim of supporting the implementation of diversification projects  the Group's priority for the coming periods  together with the growth in turnover  is to achieve an efficiency increase in the structure with a positive impact on marginality.The development of the diversification projects  with initial results expected between late 2024 and Q1 2025  is progressing as planned.The prolonged war between Russia and Ukraine  coupled with escalating tensions in the Middle East  contributes to maintaining a high level of geo-political risk worldwide  generating significant uncertainty on the global economy and businesses. As of today  marginal effects impacted the Group's operating results  however it will be necessary to continue monitoring the situation's progression throughout the year.Allocation of net resultThe Board of Directors of Racing Force S.p.A. has proposed to the Shareholders' Meeting to allocate the net profit for fiscal year 2023  amounting to 2 565 413 euro  as follows:- €2 312 928 to dividends to be distributed  amounting to €0.09 per share  before withholding tax  with an ex-dividend date of May 13th  2024  in accordance with the Euronext Growth Milan calendar  an entitlement date of May 14th  2024 and a dividend payment date of May 15th  2024;- The residual part  equal to € 252 485  to retained earnings.Execution of the Stock Grant Plan 2023-2025With regard to the first tranche (""First Tranche"") of the incentive plan ""Stock Grant Plan 2023-2025"" (the ""Plan"")  the Board of Directors noted that the objective outlined in the Plan concerning the minimum increase in consolidated adjusted EBITDA compared to the previous fiscal year has not been achieved  therefore the rights have not accrued.Concerning the second tranche of the Plan (the ""Second Tranche"")  the Board of Directors (i) has nominatively identified the beneficiaries of the Plan (""Beneficiaries"") and (ii) determined the maximum number of rights to receive ordinary shares of RFG for each of them  according to the terms and conditions of the Regulations (""Rights"")  as well as (iii) established the performance targets upon which the allocation of shares to each Beneficiary will be conditional  pursuant to the same Regulations (the ""Objectives"").In particular  the Board of Directors has set the quantity of Rights to be allocated to the Beneficiaries for the Second Tranche at a maximum of 223 765 out of a total of 1 000 000 Rights assignable overall under the Plan  corresponding to 223 765 shares of the Company.

This phase has enabled us to explore new genres and expand our expertise to include third-party studio publishing.In the future  we wish to capitalize on feedback gained from this cycle and refocus our strengths on the three genres in which we excel with a balanced publishing model to maximize revenues from our Intellectual Properties while keeping our financial commitments under control.” said Oskar Guilbert  DON'T NOD Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.2023 business reviewIn 2023  DON'T NOD posted operating revenues of €32.1 million  up 6.8% from €30.0 million in 2022. This increase reflects:a tripling in sales  mainly driven by a robust performance from the back catalog (Vampyr and the Life is Strange license)  and the contribution of the late October Jusant release;a 16.8% increase in capitalized production to €26.8 million  illustrating the ramp-up in production for the 2025 line-up and beyond;development revenues down 61.4%  reflecting the completed development of Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden.As mentioned before  2023 was marked by a highly competitive and saturated market for DON'T NOD  resulting in the postponed release of Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden to the current financial year. Furthermore  Harmony: the Fall of Reverie  a game that won critical acclaim (75/100 on Metacritic[3]) as a testament to its quality  was impacted by this environment  which curbed short-term revenues along with the game's economic potential.Against this backdrop  DON'T NOD has decided to review the book value of the Intellectual Properties recorded on the balance sheet and  in particular  to write off part of its fixed assets of around €10.5 million  with no cash impact. Excluding this item  2023 operating EBIT[4] would be around €-1.4 million.Outlook and developmentFrom the beginning of the 2024 financial year  DON'T NOD has recorded new critical successes  thereby confirming the quality of the Intellectual Property rights developed. Accordingly  Jusant won Best Sound Design at the 2024 Pégases Awards and is also a BAFTA nominee in the Best New Intellectual Property category at the prestigious British Academy Games Awards. Lastly  Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden  DON'T NOD's new narrative action-RPG game launched on February 13  received a score of 80/100 on Metacritic and 87% positive reviews from players on Steam.2024 will also mark the release of Lost Records: Bloom & Rage  the first game developed by the Montreal studio and the creators behind Life is Strange. DON'T NOD has a total of seven projects under development  including five developed in-house and two externally.Moreover  bolstered by feedback from recent launches and its solid financial structure with available cash of €54.3m[5] at the end of 2023  DON'T NOD will pursue its development strategy aimed at:focusing its production on successful action-RPG  action-adventure and narrative adventure segments to consolidate its expertise in the development of AA+ games;strengthening its ownership of Intellectual Property by favoring a balanced and mixed model of self-published and co-produced games in order to foster creativity while benefiting from strategic partnerships;confirming the target of two annual releases on average  to ensure recurring revenues while regularly expanding its back catalog.Next publication: 2023 annual results  Wednesday  April 17  2024 (after Euronext Paris market close).About DON'T NODDON'T NOD is an independent French publisher and developer  based in Paris and Montreal  creating original narrative games in the adventure (LIFE is STRANGETM  TELL ME WHYTM  TWIN MIRRORTM)  RPG (VAMPYRTM)  and action (REMEMBER METM) genres.

FY’24 results will be published on May 22nd  2024.FY’25 outlookLooking ahead  Soitec continues to anticipate significant growth in its three end-markets  where it is strengthening its leadership in SOI  and successfully executing on its expansion in compound semiconductors  particularly POI and SmartSiC™. In the short term  Soitec therefore anticipates continued strong performance in FD-SOI  POI and Power-SOI  as well as the start of SmartSiC™ ramp-up.Regarding RF-SOI  the second half of FY’24 benefited from restocking by major customers in anticipation of a smartphone market rebound in 2024  and significant orders from new customers. As already reported in the Q3’24 release the level of RF-SOI inventories at foundries level remains high and will impact the performance of H1 FY’25. However  Soitec starts to see signs of improvement with some inventory digestion downstream at OEMs and at Fabless level.As a result  Soitec expects revenue for FY’25 to be stable at constant exchange rates and perimeter as compared to FY’24 with a potential upside if the RF business recovers earlier  with strong seasonality effect. H1’25 revenue is expected to decline by around 15% year-on-year at constant exchange rates and perimeter  with especially a low point expected in Q1’25. Soitec then expects revenue to rebound in H2’25  driven by the end of RF-SOI inventory correction with foundries  the strong structural growth of its SOI products  the continued adoption of POI and the start of the SmartSiCTM ramp-up in the second half of FY’25. EBITDA1 margin2 for FY’25 is expected to be around 35%.Mid term outlookSoitec expects the RF-SOI inventory correction to end in FY’25  and its long-term growth trajectory to resume rapidly thereafter. It is confident in its growth engines supported by the strong penetration of 5G  the advent of electrification and the acceleration of artificial intelligence  as well as the successful expansion of its product portfolio  in SOI and Compound semiconductors.This expected strong rebound will be driven by the resumption of growth in RF-SOI  the progression of our leadership in SOI products (FD-SOI  Power-SOI  Photonics-SOI)  the continued acceleration of POI  and the significant revenue generated by SmartSiCTM. The group will continue to expand its leadership to new customers and new regions.Soitec will provide guidance on an annual basis and will share a FY’26 guidance at the end of FY’25.# # #AgendaFY’24 Results are due to be published on May 22nd  2024  after market close.Soitec Management will be presenting the results in Paris on May 23rd  2024# # #DisclaimerThis document is provided by Soitec (the “Company”) for information purposes only.The Company’s business operations and financial position are described in the Company’s 2022-2023 Universal Registration Document (which notably includes the 2022-2023 Annual Financial Report) which was filed on June 14th  2023 with the French stock market authority (Autorité des Marchés Financiers  or AMF) under number D.23-0482  as well as in the Company’s 2023-2024 half-year report released on November 15th  2023.

Detailed results will be presented at a future medical meeting.We are excited to be advancing efgartigimod's development in Sjogren's disease based on the totality of the data generated from the RHO study  said Luc Truyen  M.D.  Ph.D.  Chief Medical Officer of argenx. Consistent with our indication selection strategy  we confirmed our IgG biology hypothesis with these data  and now have a demonstrated clinical effect across multiple efficacy scales to support proof-of-concept. Sjogren's disease can be debilitating  predominantly affects women  and given its heterogeneous nature  is often misdiagnosed with its symptoms poorly understood. With no current approved therapies to treat the underlying disease  the unmet need is substantial  and we recognize the opportunity to advance a new potential alternative treatment to these patients.The decision to advance the clinical development of efgartigimod in SjD was supported by the safety  efficacy and biomarker results from the study. The observed safety and tolerability profile was consistent with other clinical trials. Efficacy assessments showed a treatment effect across multiple clinical endpoints  which were also consistent with biomarker data.RHO Study DesignThe Phase 2 RHO study was a randomized  double-blinded  placebo-controlled multicenter proof of concept study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of VYVGART in adults with SjD. In order to enter the study  patients needed to test positive for anti-Ro autoantibodies and maintain residual salivary flow. Thirty four patients were randomized 2:1 to receive either efgartigimod or placebo for up to 24 weeks. Multiple endpoints and biomarkers were evaluated in the signal-finding study  including the primary endpoint of CRESS (Composite of Relevant Endpoints for Sjogren's Syndrome). Within CRESS there are five components spanning: systemic disease activity as measured by the ESSDAI (EULAR Sjogren's Syndrome Activity Index)  patient reported outcomes as measured by the ESSPRI (EULAR Sjogren's Syndrome Patient Reported Index)  tear and salivary gland function and serology. To be a CRESS responder  patients needed to demonstrate a clinically meaningful benefit in at least 3 of the 5 composite items. Additional datapoints were gathered including the clinESSDAI  STAR (Sjogren's Tool for Assessing Response)  biomarker data  and the change in lymphocytic infiltrate levels through parotid biopsies.About Sjogren's DiseaseSjogren's Disease (SjD) is a chronic  slowly progressive inflammatory systemic autoimmune disease characterized by immune-mediated destruction of exocrine glands. SjD can be severely debilitating and have a negative impact on patient quality of life  with common symptoms reported as dry eyes and mouth  fatigue  joint point and impaired cognitive function. In addition  a substantial subset of patients suffer from extraglandular systemic disease. While the presence of anti-Ro and anti-LA IgG autoantibodies are considered a hallmark of disease  the underlying cause of SjD is believed to be multi-factorial  triggered by environmental factors  leading to auto-immunity and chronic inflammation. SjD predominantly impacts women with a 9:1 female:male incidence ratio. Given the heterogeneous nature of the disease  the treatment journey can be challenging with long delays and high rates of misdiagnosis. There are no FDA-approved treatments targeting the disease itself  leaving current treatments to focus primarily on individual symptom management.About EfgartigimodEfgartigimod is an antibody fragment designed to reduce pathogenic immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies by binding to the neonatal Fc receptor and blocking the IgG recycling process. Efgartigimod is being investigated in several autoimmune diseases known to be mediated by disease-causing IgG antibodies  including neuromuscular disorders  blood disorders  and skin blistering diseases  in both an intravenous and subcutaneous (SC) formulation. Efgartigimod is marketed as VYVGART ® for the treatment of generalized myasthenia gravis in more than 30 regions globally and immune thrombocytopenia in Japan.About argenxargenx is a global immunology company committed to improving the lives of people suffering from severe autoimmune diseases.

Detailed results will be presented at a future medical meeting.“We are excited to be advancing efgartigimod’s development in Sjogren’s disease based on the totality of the data generated from the RHO study ” said Luc Truyen  M.D.  Ph.D.  Chief Medical Officer of argenx. “Consistent with our indication selection strategy  we confirmed our IgG biology hypothesis with these data  and now have a demonstrated clinical effect across multiple efficacy scales to support proof-of-concept. Sjogren’s disease can be debilitating  predominantly affects women  and given its heterogeneous nature  is often misdiagnosed with its symptoms poorly understood. With no current approved therapies to treat the underlying disease  the unmet need is substantial  and we recognize the opportunity to advance a new potential alternative treatment to these patients.”The decision to advance the clinical development of efgartigimod in SjD was supported by the safety  efficacy and biomarker results from the study. The observed safety and tolerability profile was consistent with other clinical trials. Efficacy assessments showed a treatment effect across multiple clinical endpoints  which were also consistent with biomarker data.RHO Study DesignThe Phase 2 RHO study was a randomized  double-blinded  placebo-controlled multicenter proof of concept study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of VYVGART in adults with SjD. In order to enter the study  patients needed to test positive for anti-Ro autoantibodies and maintain residual salivary flow. Thirty four patients were randomized 2:1 to receive either efgartigimod or placebo for up to 24 weeks. Multiple endpoints and biomarkers were evaluated in the signal-finding study  including the primary endpoint of CRESS (Composite of Relevant Endpoints for Sjogren’s Syndrome). Within CRESS there are five components spanning: systemic disease activity as measured by the ESSDAI (EULAR Sjogren’s Syndrome Activity Index)  patient reported outcomes as measured by the ESSPRI (EULAR Sjogren’s Syndrome Patient Reported Index)  tear and salivary gland function and serology. To be a CRESS responder  patients needed to demonstrate a clinically meaningful benefit in at least 3 of the 5 composite items. Additional datapoints were gathered including the clinESSDAI  STAR (Sjogren’s Tool for Assessing Response)  biomarker data  and the change in lymphocytic infiltrate levels through parotid biopsies.About Sjogren’s DiseaseSjogren’s Disease (SjD) is a chronic  slowly progressive inflammatory systemic autoimmune disease characterized by immune-mediated destruction of exocrine glands.

Effective since the second half of 2022  the business development with candidates personally financing their driving license training has accelerated at a steady pace of +58% in 2023  now accounting for 44% of total revenue compared to 31% in 2022. This trend is expected to continue in coming years and driving hours paid cash upon registration will become the major contributor to revenue.Gross margin improved by +8% (in euros) due to higher revenue. However  it decreased by 1.6 point compared to 2022  settling at 36.9% of revenue reflecting the change in the mix of sales as previously outlined and a more aggressive pricing strategy addressing traditional candidates. However  the overall 18% price increase applied to driving hours settled cash in 2023 boosted the gross margin from traditional candidates  which rose from 27.9% in 2022 to 29.3% in 2023. This trend is expected to continue into 2024 helped by the implementation of regionally variable pricing.Operating loss for the year at -€3.9m shows a sharp reduction of €0.7m compared to the previous year  due to higher gross margin and lower operating expenses  with marketing and personnel costs contributing to a significant part of these expenses evolving as follows:- marketing costs decreased by €1M compared to prior year and were redirected during the second half of 2023 towards actions aimed at increasing the Company’s brand awareness (advertising campaigns  TV commercials).- wages and salaries rised by 13% over the year. The workforce had significantly increased during 2022  from 44 to 83 people  and gradually reduced in 2023 to 69 people by the end of the year. Savings arising from this resizing of the organization shall favorably impact 2024 expenses.Net loss  after accounting for innovation tax credit of €0.1m  stands at -€3.8m  a reduction of €0.7m compared to 2022.Above results do not include the €0.3m loss from lePERMISLIBRE Insurance  a newly created subsidiary fully owned by lePERMISLIBRE  and which was not consolidated for its first year of activity.As of December 31  2023  available cash amounted to €4.9m. After deducting all outstanding bank loans (€3.2m including €0.9m due within a year)  net cash position stands at €1.7m. The Company raised €7m (net of expenses) from its IPO in February 2023.New operational enhancements in 2023During the past year  the Company launched several initiatives to enrich and diversify its offerings  mainly:- a rebranding of lePERMISLIBRE and all communication visuals to enhance Company’s awareness.- an increased presence in towns with less than 50 000 inhabitants to densify geographic coverage and cover the entire territory.- a new service to facilitate the mandatory and cumbersome administrative procedures for registering to the driving test exams.- the ""accelerated driving license""  a new offer addressing the growing demand from candidates in large cities looking to quickly complete their training.- the driving license on automatic gearbox  increasingly popular among candidates  especially in large urban centers.In early 2024  the company also launched an innovative solution known as ""the insured driving license""  guaranteeing candidates that they will not pay any additional training hours for the practical driving test  even in the event of failure  with a guaranteed fixed price  including up to 5 exam attempts without extra cost and with enhanced pedagogy. This offer will be broadly promoted to future candidates and could also be distributed through business partners  who view those candidates as prime marketing target. It precedes other insurance innovations that the Company could offer to the entire driver’s population.2024 OutlookRecognized and appreciated for the quality of the support provided to candidates  the Company intends to further enhance its service by elevating customization and interaction with training advisors to a level far superior to competitive market offerings.""In 2024  we will support our development by leveraging the following attributes that define us and make our Company a unique player on the market: 1/optimal candidates support  2/ flexible commercial offers  and 3/ continuous innovation in data utilization.

Detailed results will be presented at a future medical meeting.“We are excited to be advancing efgartigimod’s development in Sjogren’s disease based on the totality of the data generated from the RHO study ” said Luc Truyen  M.D.  Ph.D.  Chief Medical Officer of argenx. “Consistent with our indication selection strategy  we confirmed our IgG biology hypothesis with these data  and now have a demonstrated clinical effect across multiple efficacy scales to support proof-of-concept. Sjogren’s disease can be debilitating  predominantly affects women  and given its heterogeneous nature  is often misdiagnosed with its symptoms poorly understood. With no current approved therapies to treat the underlying disease  the unmet need is substantial  and we recognize the opportunity to advance a new potential alternative treatment to these patients.”The decision to advance the clinical development of efgartigimod in SjD was supported by the safety  efficacy and biomarker results from the study. The observed safety and tolerability profile was consistent with other clinical trials. Efficacy assessments showed a treatment effect across multiple clinical endpoints  which were also consistent with biomarker data.RHO Study DesignThe Phase 2 RHO study was a randomized  double-blinded  placebo-controlled multicenter proof of concept study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of VYVGART in adults with SjD. In order to enter the study  patients needed to test positive for anti-Ro autoantibodies and maintain residual salivary flow. Thirty four patients were randomized 2:1 to receive either efgartigimod or placebo for up to 24 weeks. Multiple endpoints and biomarkers were evaluated in the signal-finding study  including the primary endpoint of CRESS (Composite of Relevant Endpoints for Sjogren’s Syndrome). Within CRESS there are five components spanning: systemic disease activity as measured by the ESSDAI (EULAR Sjogren’s Syndrome Activity Index)  patient reported outcomes as measured by the ESSPRI (EULAR Sjogren’s Syndrome Patient Reported Index)  tear and salivary gland function and serology. To be a CRESS responder  patients needed to demonstrate a clinically meaningful benefit in at least 3 of the 5 composite items. Additional datapoints were gathered including the clinESSDAI  STAR (Sjogren’s Tool for Assessing Response)  biomarker data  and the change in lymphocytic infiltrate levels through parotid biopsies.About Sjogren’s DiseaseSjogren’s Disease (SjD) is a chronic  slowly progressive inflammatory systemic autoimmune disease characterized by immune-mediated destruction of exocrine glands. SjD can be severely debilitating and have a negative impact on patient quality of life  with common symptoms reported as dry eyes and mouth  fatigue  joint point and impaired cognitive function. In addition  a substantial subset of patients suffer from extraglandular systemic disease. While the presence of anti-Ro and anti-LA IgG autoantibodies are considered a hallmark of disease  the underlying cause of SjD is believed to be multi-factorial  triggered by environmental factors  leading to auto-immunity and chronic inflammation. SjD predominantly impacts women with a 9:1 female:male incidence ratio. Given the heterogeneous nature of the disease  the treatment journey can be challenging with long delays and high rates of misdiagnosis. There are no FDA-approved treatments targeting the disease itself  leaving current treatments to focus primarily on individual symptom management.About EfgartigimodEfgartigimod is an antibody fragment designed to reduce pathogenic immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies by binding to the neonatal Fc receptor and blocking the IgG recycling process.

(Euronext Milan: SOM)  which specialises in the engineering  production and commissioning of complex turnkey projects in the civil and naval engineering sectors  met today under the chairmanship of Oscar Marchetto  approving the draft Financial Statements and non-financial disclosure 2023 and examining the Consolidated Financial Statements as at 31 December 2023.Group revenues grew by 12.8% to 371.0 million Euro  confirming the solidity and resilience of the historical business  namely Engineered systems for naval architecture and building façades  which was recently renamed ""Horizons"". At the same time  figures highlight the strong growth potential of the Mestieri segment  focused on the design and creation of bespoke interiors  which posted a revenue increase of 37.3%  approaching 100 million Euro threshold (95.7 million Euro).The Group's organic growth improved by 9.2%  compounded by the +3.6% contribution of acquisitions in the period.Although there was a drop in operating margin at 31 December 2023  from 2.9 million to 0.2 million Euro  recent economic performance has been impacted by extraordinary and unforeseen circumstances related to non-recurring events  concerning two subsidiaries. Both refer to two past contracts submitted before the acquisition of the two entities  which gave rise to revisions of expected margins  partly due to the increase in costs incurred.The Net Financial Position prior to IFRS 161 at 31 December 2023 stood at 60.1 million Euro (compared to 54.3 million Euro in 2022). This result is due to several components  in particular modest cash generation  the payment of earn-outs in the companies Fabbrica and Budri  the distribution of dividends to minority1 This indicator corresponds to net financial debt  including current and non-current derivative assets  and net of current and non-current lease liabilities recognised in accordance with IFRS 16.shareholders and the impact of the debt revaluation for exercising the put&call option on the Budri and Skillmax companies.Oscar Marchetto  Chairman of Somec  said: ""The growth in revenues in 2023 shows that our Group is operating in fast-growing businesses  both in Europe and the United States  and is able to express dynamism and the ability to adapt to market developments. At the same time  the year's results highlight critical issues caused by some extraordinary and circumscribed events  whose consequences have significantly impacted margins. For this reason  we have implemented several internal reorganization measures and investments in processes and their digitisation that will help us to gradually improve our position  starting from the current financial year. I am looking forward to the future  thanks in part to the acquisitions we have made and to the consequent broadening of our business lines. I am certain that the skills we possess and the attractiveness of the Made in Italy brand  of which we are a proud bearer  will continue to attract new customers"".Revenues and backlogFY 2023FY 2022 % changeTotal 214.6 57.8% 60.8 16.4% 95.7 25.8% 371.0 100.0% 193.6 58.9% 65.5 19.9% 69.7 21.2% 328.8 100.0%+10.8%-7.2%+37.3%+12.8%The Engineered systems for naval architecture and building façades operating segment  which takes the new name of HORIZONS  posted revenues of 214.6 million Euro  10.8% up on 2022  when revenues amounted to 193.6 million Euro. This progress was supported by growing new building and refitting activities and by the dynamism of the structural glazing market in the United States.Revenues for the TALENTA Professional Kitchen Systems and Products operating segment decreased slightly by 7.2% to 60.8 million Euro compared to 65.5 million Euro in the previous year. This reduction is attributable to a slight slowdown in the production of kitchen systems for the naval sector and to a reduction in volumes for the product lines bespoke professional kitchens and refrigeration products. On a brighter note  there was a rise in revenue for products related to industrial pizza ovens which  thanks in part to penetration in the US market  recorded an increase in volumes.MESTIERI  the operating segment dedicated to the design and creation of bespoke interiors  recorded significant results  with an increase in revenues of 37.3% to 95.7 million Euro (69.7 million Euro in 2022)  thanks to the development of projects and activities in the European market as well as the contribution of acquisitions.The total Group backlog at 31 December 2023  which will be developed over a time horizon from the current year through 2031  amounted to 752.4 million Euro  of which 26.2% related to option contracts.ProfitabilityEBITDA for 2023 amounted to 18.2 million Euro  compared to 23.2 million Euro in the previous year. Notwithstanding a significant revenue performance  the EBITDA margin fell to 4.9%  compared to 7.1% for the same period in 2022.Profitability was negatively impacted primarily by two non-recurring and circumscribed extraordinary components  involving some activities of two subsidiaries. Both refer to two past contracts  signed prior to the entry of the two entities in the Group  which gave rise to revisions of expected margins  due in part to an increase in costs incurred.The Consolidated net result was thus impacted by non-recurring events and the exercising of the put&call option on an acquired company that is performing above expectations. The loss for the year was 10.4 million Euro  compared to a loss of 0.5 million Euro in the previous year.Balance SheetNet working capital stood at 13.1 million Euro  down by 7.5 million Euro  compared with 20.6 million Euro as at 31 December 2022.The main changes are due to: i) a significant reduction in trade receivables as a result of a strategy to improve working capital efficiency  partly through the assignment of receivables held without recourse to leading shipyards; ii) an increase in contract work in progress mitigated by the increase in liabilities for contract work in progress and advances from customers and by a reduction in inventory. The effect of these three items on revenues was slightly positive compared to the previous year  confirming the increasing attention paid to the timing of the final analysis and billing of advances; iii) a fall in trade payables  bringing them down to normal levels for the sector; (iv) a fall in other current assets and liabilities due to the lower incidence of advances to suppliers.The Group Shareholders' equity amounted to 18.2 million Euro at 31 December 2023 compared to 32.0 million Euro at 31 December 2022. The change is mainly attributable to the result for the period and the negative change in translation reserves.The net financial position  excluding the effects of IFRS 16  amounted to 60.1 million Euro (54.3 million Euro in 2022)  an increase of 5.8 million Euro  mainly due to the payment of earn-outs in the Fabbrica and Budri companies  the distribution of dividends to minority shareholders of 3.1 million Euro and the impact of the revaluation of the put & call debt on the Budri and Skillmax subsidiaries.Before considering the effects of IFRS 16  the Net Financial Position amounted to 84.3 million Euro in 2023 (81.9 million Euro in 2022).Significant events occurred during the 2023 fiscal yearCompletion of Gino Ceolin S.r.l. 60% acquisitionOn 25 January 2023 Somec S.p.A. completed  through its direct subsidiary Mestieri S.p.A. (formerly Mestieri S.r.l.)  the acquisition of 60% of the share capital of Gino Ceolin S.r.l.. The company was fully consolidated over the entire yearly period.Reorganisation of Fabbrica Works S.r.l.On 26 July 2023 Somec S.p.A. completed the reorganisation of the company  which was already indirectly controlled  Fabbrica Works S.r.l.  directly acquiring 16% of the share capital  bringing its controlling share - direct and indirect - to 86%.Increased participation in Bluesteel S.r.l.On 18 September 2023 Somec S.p.A. signed a deed of sale with one of the minority shareholders of the company Bluesteel S.r.l.  with a view to transferring to Somec S.p.A.  without a cash contribution  34% of the relative share capital. At the closing date of the financial statements  therefore  the Parent Company's equity interest rose from 60% to 94% of the share capital.Completed acquisition of Mestieri USA Inc.On 4 December 2023 Somec S.p.A. completed  through its direct subsidiary Mestieri S.p.A. (formerly Mestieri S.r.l.)  the acquisition of 40% of the share capital of US company Mestieri USA Inc. from the independent shareholder 2.0 Partners LLC. Following this agreement  Mestieri S.p.A. raised its controlling interest from 60% to 100% of the share capital  thus becoming the sole shareholder of the American company.Increase in share capital in Mestieri S.p.A.On 29 December 2023  as part of a reorganization of the Group  and in particular of the ""Mestieri"" operating segment  the Shareholders' Meeting of Mestieri S.r.l. resolved to increase the share capital from a nominal 0.1 million Euro to a nominal 3.0 million Euro. The share capital increase was offered for subscription to the sole shareholder Somec S.p.A. The relative quota was paid and settled by contribution in kind to Mestieri S.r.l. ofthe shareholding held by the Parent Company in the companies Skillmax S.r.l. and Total Solution Interiors S.r.l..As a result of this operation  the legal form of Mestieri S.r.l. was changed into a joint-stock company (Società per Azioni- S.p.A.)  and took on the company name Mestieri S.p.A. At the closing date of these financial statements  Mestieri S.p.A. holds 60% of the share capital of Skillmax S.r.l. and 80% of the share capital of Total Solution Interiors S.r.l.Major non-recurring events in fiscal year 2023TSI - Losses accrued in a shipyard in fourth quarter 2023The first non-recurring item refers to an order completed in the last quarter of 2023 by the subsidiary Total Solution Interiors S.r.l.  concerning the design  production and installation of common areas and of private areas of various types in a cruise ship at a shipyard.As a result of some critical issues encountered in execution  the Group incurred significantly higher costs than budgeted  generating an operating loss in the second half of 2023 for approx. 4.5 million Euro.It seems useful to point out that the original contract referred to a construction project already acquired by TSI in 2019-2020  and that the estimates and related management evaluations were based on that project. In more detail  in the final phase of the order  there was a compression of installation time  which resulted in negative impacts on quality and a consequent increase in final costs.At the close of the work  the client also intimated additional charges to the Somec Group  which were the subject of a discussion and only finally settled on 6 March 2024.The Group believes that what happened is extraordinary in magnitude and unlikely to be replicated in the future  given the following aspects:• there are no further option contracts with the same object with this client  and more generally by the Group choice  there are no other works with similar object in the backlog;• there are no other interior jobs in the group's backlog at the same shipyard.Bluesteel Glazing projects - Modification of contract variations under discussionSubsidiary Bluesteel S.r.l.  a company acquired by the Group during 2022 and operating in the building façades market  with a particular focus on the UK  concurrently with the close of the fiscal year  revised some variations entered on a contract signed in 2019 and completed in 2023 and for which an adjudication procedure (similar to arbitration) was instituted. The procedure concluded with a negative opinion on March 20  2024  rejecting the recognition of greater incurred costs with a consequent impact of approx. 1.0 million Euro.The extraordinary events involving the two subsidiaries Total Solution Interiors S.r.l. and Bluesteel S.r.l. represent the main reasons for the non-achievement of the guidance targets released on 25 September 2023  revised in a press release dated 8 March 2024.IT Project - Digital TransformationFinally  among the main non-recurring costs  investments for the development of the IT Project - Digital Transformation  involving the adoption of a cloud ERP  should be highlighted. Since it does not represent an intangible fixed asset  this project carries a cost that has burdened the operating result in the amount of 1.4 million Euro  despite having multi-year benefits.Significant events occurred after 31 December 2023Exceeding covenants under a pool loan agreementBased on the economic and financial data  it was found that the covenants under a medium- and long-term pool loan agreement entered in fiscal 2022 with three leading banks were exceeded. This loan requires compliance with economic/financial parameters  or covenants  to be calculated annually based on the results of the consolidated financial statements (specifically: Net Financial Debt/EBITDA and Net Financial Debt/Shareholders' equity). Based on the figures as of 31 December 2023  both parameters were not met. Therefore  the company promptly initiated talks with the financing institutions to meet the conditions for obtaining a special waiver  by the time the consolidated financial statements are approved by the Board of Directors. As of today's date  the waiver has been obtained.Outlook for financial year 2024The Group foresees  for the HORIZONS operating segment  on the one hand a gradual stabilisation of raw material costs  with returns to pre-Covid levels  and on the other hand a growth in refitting activities. For the same operating segment  moreover  the current fiscal year will see the end of the negative effects associated with the activities of the subsidiary Bluesteel S.r.l.  the management of which has been entrusted to new management figures. The TALENTA operating segment a general recovery in business  and aided by a gradual decrease in raw material costs  is expected to return to high performance levels. For the MESTIERI operating segment  also supported by a general return to favourable raw material costs  further business development is expected  driven in particular by the luxury segments and the U.S. market  as well as the effects of a new organization starting with the already completed appointment of a general manager in Total Solution Interiors S.r.l.  and the adoption of new ERPs and PLMs for the management of processes and monitoring of performance.Proposal for allocation of the result for financial year 2023The Board of Directors resolved to propose to the Ordinary Shareholders' Meeting to carry forward the loss of 8 285 402.14 Euro.Other Resolutions of the Board of DirectorsApproval of the new incentive plan for the three-year period 2024-2026In order to ensure the greatest alignment with the interests of Shareholders and long-term value creation  the Board of Directors meeting of 27 March 2024  upon the proposal of the Remuneration Committee  approved the 2024-2026 Plan in favour of the Company's Strategic Executives  including certain Executive Directors. The 2024-2026 Plan will be submitted for approval to the Shareholders' Meeting called to approve the financial statements for the year ending 31 December 2023.The adoption of the 2024-2026 Plan responds to the recommendations of the Corporate Governance Code  Article 5 of which recognises that plans of this type represent a suitable tool for aligning the interests of executive directors and executives with strategic responsibilities of listed companies with those of the Shareholders  allowing them to pursue the priority objective of creating value in the medium-long term.The Plan is mainly aimed at pursuing the following goals:• aligning management interests with the achievement of economic-financial objectives within a framework of sustainability in the medium-long term;• structuring a plan balanced between industrial growth  capitalisation and dividend objectives  between medium and long-term objectives  in line with a relevant performance period  which is in line with the recommendations of the Corporate Governance Code;• focus the attention of beneficiaries in the pursuit of strategic objectives  in line with those set forth in the industrial plan  transforming management into ""shareholders"" in terms of both interests and values;• attracting and motivating resources  rewarding the achievement of results and enhancing the behaviour put in place to achieve them;• developing and reinforcing the commitment of resources following the move to Euronext Milan  enabling them to increase their sense of belonging to the Group.The object of the Plan is the free assignment of a maximum number of Performance Shares  calculated as a percentage of the beneficiaries' fixed compensation and subsequently converted into shares based on the arithmetic average of the official price of SOMEC's ordinary shares recorded on Euronext Milan in the 30 days preceding the date of the Shareholders' Meeting that will approve the financial statements as of 31 December 2023 (""Performance Shares""). The annual incidence of the Performance Share on the fixed remuneration of each beneficiary of the 2024-2026 Plan is approximately 100%  for each of the three years of the duration of the Plan.The 2024-2026 Plan consists entirely of Performance Shares.For the Performance Goals  the Company has agreed on the following payout levels:• for Consolidated Cumulative Adjusted EBITDA 2024-2026  for a performance of 90% or less  the payout is 0; for a performance between 90% and 100% (target) the payout is linear between 50% and 100%; for a performance from 100% the payout is linear  with a maximum cap of 120%;• for ESG Performance Targets the payout  against performance achieved  ranges between 0 and 100%.The essential features of the 2024-2026 Plan are detailed in the relevant information document prepared pursuant to Article 84-bis of the Issuers' Regulations  to which reference should be made  available to the public at the company's registered office in San Vendemiano  Via Palù no. 30 and on the website (www.somecgruppo.com) in the ""Governance > Remuneration"" section.Renewal of the authorisation to purchase and hold treasury sharesWith specific reference to the proposal to renew the authorisation by the Shareholders' Meeting to purchase and dispose of treasury shares  subject to revocation of the resolution adopted by the Shareholders' Meeting on 4 May 2023  it should be noted that the reasons underlying the authorisation will be specified in detail in the Explanatory Report drafted pursuant to Article 125-ter of the Consolidated Law on Finance (TUF)  as well as Articles 73 and 84-ter of Consob Regulation No.11971 /1999 and subsequent amendments and additions  which will be made available to the public  together with the notice of call of the Shareholders' Meeting  no later than 14 April 2024 (at least 15 days before the date of the Shareholders' Meeting)  in the manner indicated above.

Sales made in US dollars represented approximately 62% of consolidated revenue from continuing operations in FY 2023.Aerospace sales amounted to EUR 8 801 thousand (+EUR 2 072 thousand / +30.8% vs. FY 2022) and confirmed the strong recovery of this business in the wake of FY 2021 and following the weakening impacts of the Covid-19 pandemic. The Aerospace business represents 62.5% of consolidated revenue from continuing operations (FY 2022: 72.1%) and remains the Group's leading market segment. Medical sales amounted to EUR 3 589 thousand and also demonstrated high levels of activity  showing an increase of EUR 1 109 thousand compared to FY 2022 (+44.7% vs 2022).The optical communications division  whose commercial activities started in January 2023 following the implementation of a fabless organization  recorded a revenue of EUR 1 555 thousand for FY 2023.Royalties from licensed trademarks  including the Ioma brand  contributed to a revenue of EUR 128 thousand  consistent with the previous financial year.Analysis of the consolidated income statementMEMSCAP’s consolidated earnings for FY 2023  and presented in accordance with IFRS 5  are given within the following table:In thousands of euros 2022 2023 Revenue from continuing operations 9 336 14 073 Cost of revenue (5 659) (8 033) Gross margin 3 677 6 040 % of revenue 39.4% 42.9% Operating expenses* (3 441) (3 563) Operating profit / (loss) 236 2 477 Financial profit / (loss) 7 (304) Income tax expense (92) (33) Net profit / (loss) from continuing operations 151 2 140 Profit / (loss) after tax from discontinued operations 897 -- Net profit / (loss) 1 048 2 140(Financial data were subject to an audit by the Group’s statutory auditors who will issue their reports at a later date. On March 27th  2024  the MEMSCAP’s board of directors authorized the release of the FY 2023 consolidated financial statements. Any apparent discrepancies in totals are due to rounding.)* Net of research & development grants.The significant increase in sales volumes  as well as the product mix effect  impacted the Group's gross margin rate  which stood at 42.9% compared to 39.4% in the previous year. The consolidated gross margin thus amounted to EUR 6 040 thousand compared to EUR 3 677 thousand for FY 2022.Operating expenses  net of research and development grants  amounted to EUR 3 563 thousand compared to EUR 3 441 million for FY 2022. Net of research and development grants  the amount of research and development expenses was EUR 1 402 thousand for FY 2023  compared to EUR 1 510 thousand for the previous year  and included the development of new generations of avionics products. Net research and development expenses  including grants  thus represented 10.0% of the consolidated revenue (2022: 16.2%). As part of the Group's business growth  sales and administrative expenses increased by +18.7% and +8.0%  respectively  for FY 2023 compared to FY 2022.The average full-time equivalent workforce of the Group related to continuing operations increased from 41.3 employees in FY 2022 to 54.5 employees in FY 2023  representing a growth of +31.9%.For FY 2023  the Group posted an operating profit from continuing operations of EUR 2 477 thousand (17.6% of revenue) compared to an operating profit of EUR 236 thousand for FY 2022. The net financial loss of EUR 304 thousand for FY 2023 (2022: Non-significant net financial gain)  included notably a foreign exchange loss of EUR 234 thousand (2022: Foreign exchange gain of EUR 138 thousand). The tax expense recognized over FY 2023 and FY 2022 corresponded to the variation in deferred tax assets. This tax expense had no impact on the Group's cash position.The Group therefore reported a net profit after tax from continuing operations of EUR 2 140 thousand (15.2% of revenue) for FY 2023 compared to a net profit of EUR 151 thousand for FY 2022.Including the profit of continuing and discontinued operations  the Group reported a net profit of EUR 2 140 thousand (15.2% of revenue) for FY 2023 compared to a net profit of EUR 1 048 thousand for FY 2022. It is recalled that the net profit for FY 2022 included the exceptional capital gain of EUR 1 754 thousand resulting from the sale of assets dedicated to the foundry activity (Custom Products – Discontinued operations in FY 2022) held by the Group's US subsidiary.Evolution of the Group’s cash / Consolidated shareholders’ equityThe adjusted EBITDA1 for continuing operations in FY 2023 amounted to EUR 3 263 thousand (23.2% of revenue) compared to EUR 1 443 thousand for FY 2022. It is noted that research and development costs were fully recognized as expenses and were not capitalized in the Group's balance sheet over FY 2023.As of December 31  2023  the Group posted available cash of EUR 6 237 thousand (December 31  2022: EUR 5 456 thousand) including cash investments (Corporate bonds / investment securities) recorded under non-current financial assets. In a context of very strong business growth and increased production  MEMSCAP generated a positive cash flow from continuing operational activities of EUR 1 752 thousand compared to EUR 1 411 thousand in FY 2022.As of December 31  2023  the amount of debts and financial borrowings (excluding lease liabilities) stood at EUR 128 thousand  and net available cash (excluding lease liabilities) amounts to EUR 6 109 thousand.As of December 31  2023  MEMSCAP shareholders’ equity totalled EUR 17 676 thousand (December 31  2022: EUR 15 587 thousand).1 Adjusted EBITDA means operating profit before depreciation  amortisation  and share-based payment charge (IFRS 2) and including foreign exchange gains/losses related to ordinary activities.PerspectivesThe financial year 2023 initiates MEMSCAP's trajectory towards its ambition expressed in the 4G Plan 2026. The Aerospace / Medical segment remains the main driver both in terms of growth and profitability. The optical communications  while remaining a profitability support factor for the Group  continue to display significant volatility due to the Asian context and investments dedicated to optical fiber.“Growth and profitability in financial year 2023 reinforce our initial ambition outlined in the 4G Plan 2026. Regarding our aerospace activities  MEMSCAP teams are currently focused on providing industrial and commercial solutions for the engine control market and winning an increasing number of innovative programs to prepare the post-2026 period.” said Jean Michel Karam  President and CEO of MEMSCAP. “In the medical sector  we are expanding the use of our sensors for a variety of applications. MEMSCAP's high profitability  strong balance sheet  together with our expertise combined with solid entry barriers resulting of years of development  now allow us to select our partners and target markets and refine a sustainable high-margin model that is not subject to price erosion. Regardless of the intrinsic volatility of the optical communications market  our growth engines in Aerospace and Medical support the trajectory of the 4G plan and its landing in 2026.”Shareholders and investors video conference - Thursday  March 28  2024 at 11:00 a.m.Thank you for registering and sending your questions in advance using the following link:Registration for the video conferenceQ1 2024 earnings: April 29  2024Annual meeting of shareholders: May 31  2024About MEMSCAPMEMSCAP is a leading provider MEMS based pressure sensors  best-in-class in term of precision and stability (very low drift) for two market segments: aerospace and medical.MEMSCAP also provides variable optical attenuators (VOA) for the optical communications market.For more information  visit our website at: www.memscap.comMEMSCAP is listed on Euronext Paris (Euronext Paris - Memscap - ISIN code: FR0010298620 - Ticker symbol: MEMS)CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION at 31 December 202331 December202331 December2022€000 €000 Assets Non-current assets Property  plant and equipment.................................................................. 937 901 Goodwill and intangible assets................................................................... 6 682 6 888 Right-of-use assets.................................................................................... 5 354 4 764 Other non-current financial assets............................................................. 1 436 1 276 Employee benefit net asset........................................................................ 1 6 Deferred tax asset..................................................................................... 106 137 14 516 13 972 Current assets Inventories................................................................................................ 4 054 2 578 Trade and other receivables...................................................................... 2 714 2 494 Prepayments............................................................................................. 197 222 Cash and short-term deposits.................................................................... 4 801 4 180 11 766 9 474 Total assets 26 282 23 446 Equity and liabilities Equity Issued capital............................................................................................ 1 869 1 869 Share premium.......................................................................................... 17 972 17 972 Treasury shares.........................................................................................

This level of profitability puts us in line with the best standards in the field. It also validates the effectiveness of our business model  which is based on a high value-added commercial offer combined with a controlled cost structure. The financial position at the end of the 2023 financial year is strengthened  with a cash position of €3.7 million  and a positive operational cash flow which allows us to finance our growth. For the coming years  we intend to further improve our profitability  amplifying our business development and expanding our offering to meet the growing needs of our customers. On the strength of these very good results  Arcure is now perfectly positioned to achieve its ambition to become the leading technological and economic player in the buoyant market for the digitalization of vehicles and industrial sites.”Jean-Gabriel POINTEAU  Chief Executive Officer at Arcure  adds: “These results for 2023 validate our development model and reinforce our strategic vision for the future. Today  as a technological and commercial leader for the solutions improving the safety and productivity of industrial vehicles  we want to accentuate our lead and bring more and more innovative and efficient solutions to industrial players. After the success of pedestrian detection  we have already expanded our high-tech offering with new features  around fleet management for example  which will accelerate the digitalization of industrial vehicles. We intend to accentuate this dynamic of innovation  by refocusing our efforts on our core expertise and our added value: software and artificial intelligence.”SOLID RESULTS AND PROFITABILITYAlong with an increase in revenue  Arcure also recorded increased profitability in 2023. EBE came to €4.1 million  compared to €1.1 million in 2022  with personnel expenses contained at €6.2 million in 2023 (compared to €5.8 million in 2022). The commercial success associated with a controlled cost structure validates the performance of the business model.Operating income was €1.709 million  compared with €0.2 million in 2022. The financial result amounted to €(0.6) million  compared to €(0.2) million in 2022. The Company generated a sharp increase in net income to €1.8 million  after a first profitable year in 2022 (€50 K)  which underlines the strength of its growth model.The gross margin rate improved from 51% in 2022 to 57%  in a context of sustained growth. This growth is partly explained by the commercial ramp-up of the Blaxtair Origin® in 2023  which has better margins compared to the previous generations of Blaxtair®.A SOUND FINANCIAL STRUCTUREThe level of profitability recorded in 2023 now allows the Company to finance the growth of the business  in particular the increase in working capital. Net cash flows related to investment were under control at (€2.2 million) compared to (€2.5 million) in 2022. The company continued its deleveraging by reducing its bank debt by 24% in 2023  repaying €1.3 million in loans. As of December 31  2023  the cash position amounted to €3.7 million. The Company's shareholders' equity increased to €6.8 million  compared with €5.1 million at the end of 2022.40% INCREASE IN REVENUE  DRIVEN BY INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION2023 revenue at Arcure hit a historic €18.2 million  up 40% compared to 2022  ahead of the target of €20 million in 2024. This dynamic growth over the year was mainly driven by excellent sales performance for Blaxtair Origin®  which has been on the market since the end of 2022.The sales efforts have allowed to increase sales volumes in all sales channels. Business has been driven by strong sales trends with industrial key account customers who are equipping their fleets with Blaxtair® solutions. The share of sales to machinery manufacturers who offer Blaxtair® equipment in factory settings (Original Equipment Manufacturers - OEMs) on new automobiles accounted for 20% of our revenue  up from 26%.The 2023 financial year accentuates Arcure's internationalization  with 84% of revenue now generated outside France (72.6% in 2022). The European region achieved major growth  spread out over an increasing diversity of countries  particularly in Spain  the United Kingdom  Italy and Luxembourg. North America (25% of revenue) achieved 22% growth. Business in the Asia-Pacific region (4% of revenues) grew by 40%.GROWTH PROSPECTS CONFIRMED FOR 2024At the end of 2023  the Company is ideally positioned in a high-potential market where the need for digitalization of forklifts and construction machinery to strengthen safety and productivity is increasingly significant.Arcure continues to roll out its product roadmap with new features and high value-added embedded software solutions. The Company has announced the launch in March 2024 of its latest generation of Blaxtair®  a technological core of the digitalization of industrial vehicles with connected functionalities for safety and productivity. This evolution of the product mix will increase the number of Blaxtair® installed per machine and - thanks to the connected platform and its associated services - generate a growing share of recurring revenue.Growth in activity will also be supported by solid demand from major industrial accounts and machine manufacturers  in France and abroad. Intensified discussions with vehicle manufacturers (OEMs)  in particular  are expected to be a growth driver in 2025 and beyond.The very good results recorded in 2023  the technological innovation  the international commercial establishment and the detailed knowledge of the needs of industrial players are all assets to support Arcure's growth momentum in the years to come.Next meeting:Webcast in English for international investors  March 27  2024 at 5 p.m  CET.Applications: investisseurs@arcure.netWebcast in French for individual investors  March 27  2024 at 6 p.m  CET.Applications: investisseurs@arcure.netNext publication:H1 2024 revenue  July 17  2024About ArcureFounded in 2009  Arcure is an international group  specialized in artificial intelligence applied to perception technology for the industry  which develops and markets solutions to enhance the autonomy and safety of industrial machines and robots.In particular  Arcure has developed Blaxtair®  a state-of-the-art intelligent pedestrian detection solution  improving safety around commercial vehicles in many contexts  including the most difficult environments.

These key milestones pave the way for another year of sustained business growth and improved profitability in 2024. In the longer term  the outlook remains promising for ENOGIA  whose technology provides a unique response to the environmental and financial challenges facing manufacturers.”2023 resultsIn € thousands 2022 2023 Change Revenue 3 296 5 074 +53% Operating revenues 5 760 7 858 +36% EBITDA[1] (4 024) (1 476) +2 548 Operating profit/(loss) (5 093) (2 777) +2 316 Net financial income/(expense) (128) (135) -7 Net exceptional income/(expenses) 287 (35) -322 Tax credits 596 486 -110 Net profit/(loss) (4 339) -2 462 +1 877In 2023  ENOGIA’s revenue amounted to €5.1 million  an increase of 53% compared with 2022 and perfectly in line with the stated target (> 50%). Exports remained high at 83% of revenue  reflecting a significant increase in Western Europe (excluding France)  particularly Germany.Sustained commercial momentum in both businessesThe ORC Modules business generated revenue of €4.4 million in 2023  an increase of 42%. It benefited in particular from progress on the contract for 40 machines for an anaerobic digestion site in Germany  all of which will have been delivered by next April. Moreover  the successful completion of this contract has provided ENOGIA with a great showcase  enabling it to sell a further four ORC modules for agricultural biogas in Germany in 2023.Among other significant ORC contract wins  the execution of the Company’s first order in the maritime sector  with Chantiers de l’Atlantique  began in the fourth quarter of 2023. ENOGIA is preparing to equip two cruise ships with its new ENO‑180LT‑M module  a marine version of the standard ENO‑180LT module capable of producing 180 kW of electricity from a low-temperature heat source (from 90°C). The same model has also been selected by Taiwan Cement Corporation (TCC) for a major sale of modules for a power plant producing electricity from geothermal wells.Finally  in 2023  the Group signed its first contract in the economy-of-use sector  via the Green Shield Power Solutions offer of a service to produce electricity from waste heat under long-term contracts (PPA model).Innovative Turbomachinery  ENOGIA’s second business  formerly known as Hydrogen Turbomachinery and Compressors and now refocused on development for third parties  almost quadrupled its revenue to €0.63 million in 2023. This business has won several contracts with industrial companies committed to decarbonisation  such as the CO2 capture project with Korean company STX Engine in the marine sector.First effects of the operational efficiency plan on profitabilityOver the full 2023 financial year  operating revenues increased by 36% to €7.9 million  reflecting the combined increase in revenue and capitalised production (up 13% to €2.0 million) related to R&D investment.Alongside the increase in business  the three-pillar operational efficiency plan – reorganisation  reduction in fixed costs  increase in gross margins – has produced its first effects on operating profitability. Product re-engineering and negotiations with suppliers had a positive impact on gross margin. At the same time  workforce adjustments led to a fall in personnel expenses (13% reduction to €3.4 million). Purchases and external charges were also down (by 11% to €4.9 million)  despite a large number of contracts being in progress.EBITDA for the year was therefore negative €1.5 million  a much smaller loss than in 2022 (negative €4.0 million). In addition  EBITDA for the second half of 2023 was at breakeven (positive €0.02 million)  in line with the target announced in conjunction with the half-year results.After €1.4 million in depreciation of fixed assets  the operating loss was €2.8 million (compared with a loss of €5.1 million in 2022) and the net loss was €2.5 million (loss of €4.3 million in 2022).On the balance sheet  shareholders’ equity increased from €4.9 million in 2022 to €7.8 million in 2023  thanks to the €4.6 million capital increase completed last July. Net debt was €2.6 million at the close of the year  putting gearing at 32.6% as of 31 December 2023.After the close of the 2023 financial year  ENOGIA successfully completed its bond placement via the LITA.co crowdfunding platform  which selects companies committed to environmental and social transition. By the close of the transaction at the end of March  the maximum amount of the planned issue range  i.e. €2.3 million  had been raised.OutlookThe company is approaching 2024 with confidence  buoyed by the visibility provided by its order book of €6.7 million at the end of 2023[2] (vs > €5 million in 2022) and the many signs of interest in ENOGIA’s unique technology from manufacturers.The ORC business should continue to enjoy sustained momentum in 2024  particularly in the geothermal and marine sectors. The Company also expects its Green Shield Power Solutions offering to gain momentum  at a time when discussions are underway with many manufacturers seeking both to secure electricity prices over a long period and to intensify their decarbonisation strategy. At the same time  the Innovative Turbomachinery division should continue to expand in 2024.Against this backdrop  ENOGIA confirms its expectation of revenue growth averaging more than 50% per year in both 2024 and 2025.This growth  combined with the operational efficiency plan now completed  should enable the Company to break even in 2024.Lastly  ENOGIA confirms its target of positive free cash flow by 2025.Next release:Annual General Meeting  on 6 June 2024 at 10 a.m.First-half revenue  on 22 July 2024 after tradingAboutEnogia ENOGIA responds to the major challenges of the ecological and energy transition with its unique and patented technology of compact  light and durable micro-turbomachinery.

These measures  combined with the return to sales growth since Q3 2023  have enabled Invibes to meet its objective in returning to profitable growth in 2023.Recurring EBITDA (REBITDA) amounted therefore to €2.0m in 2023  compared with -€1.1m in 2022  representing an increase of €3.2m between the two financial years.After accounting for non-current expenses  EBITDA was €2.0m in 2023  compared with-€4.5m in 2022  which included costs relating to the restructuring undertaken in the second half of 2022.The breakdown of EBITDA by country maturity is as follows:Audited consolidated figures in €K 2023 2022 Δ Existing countries (1) Sales figures 17 267 (2) 19 892 -13 2% EBITDA 5 198 5 131 +1 3% % EBITDA 30% 26% Scale-up (3) Sales figures 9 927 7 538 +31 7% EBITDA 1 902 (640) n/a % EBITDA 19% n/a New countries (start-up) (4) Sales figures 973 536 +81 5% EBITDA (579) (1 529) n/a % EBITDA n/a n/a Discontinued operations (5) Sales figures 701 - n/a EBITDA 17 - n/a Group overheads (6) (4 567) (7 470) -38 9% Consolidated EBITDA 1 971 (4 508) +6 479 €(1) France  Spain  Switzerland(2) The ML2Grow business has been restated as a discontinued operation following its disposal in March 2024(3) Germany  United Kingdom  Italy  and Belgium(4) Sweden  Norway  Denmark  South Africa  Netherlands  UAE  Poland  and Czech Republic(5) Corresponds to ML2Grow sold in March 2024(6) Excluding CAPEXDespite a fall in activity in the countries where Invibes has been established the longest (France  Spain  Switzerland)  EBITDA rose slightly  enabling the margin to increase by 4 points to 30% of sales  demonstrating the resilience of the model when a market is mature and established and all the fundamentals are activated  despite difficult market conditions.EBITDA in countries in the scale-up phase rose sharply in 2023 to reach 19% of sales  illustrating the strength of Invibes' international development model  which is based on its ability to roll out its activity rapidly and successfully in a new country so that it becomes a contributor to profitability in less than two years after its launch.After reaching the threshold of nearly one million in sales during 2023  the new countries recently opened (start-ups) will rapidly benefit  like the scale-ups  from the strength of the model and increase their contribution to the Group's profitability.It should be noted that ML2Grow was sold in March 2024 and is therefore accounted for as a discontinued operation. The purpose of acquiring the company in 2019 was to strengthen Invibes' machine learning capabilities to further analyse data using AI. Through knowledge transfer  the ML2Grow team has helped us take our AI initiatives forward. We thank them and wish them all the best.Operating profit and net profit also returned to positive territory.Including depreciation and amortisation of €1.3m  Invibes posted an operating profit of €0.6m. After including a financial charge of €0.6m and a tax credit of €0.6m relating to the capitalisation of deferred tax  net profit came to €0.6m.Between 2022 and 2023  operating profit and net profit have risen by €8.3m and €8.5m respectively  demonstrating the Group's ability to adapt its costs rapidly to changes in its business and maintain sustained profitability  without penalising its capacity for innovation or its ability to win new business.As of 31 December 2023  Invibes had a solid financial structure  with net cash of €10.8m and shareholders' equity of €21.7m.Outlook for 2024Once again buoyed by a recovering digital advertising market  Invibes has entered 2024 with more favourable parameters.To increase the density of its cross-market offer and meet the demand of its international key account customers looking for a global offer  Invibes intends to extend its geographical footprint with the opening of 3 new markets  the United States  Mexico  and Singapore.On the strength of its ability to model the ROI of launching a new country  Invibes expects these new markets to contribute to business a few months after their launch and then to the group's profitability within 2 years.In 2024  Invibes is confident that it will continue to grow its business while maintaining positive profitability.Next publication: Q1 2024 sales  on 25 April 2024 (after trading).About Invibes AdvertisingInvibes Advertising (Invibes) is an international technology company specialising in digital advertising innovation.Founded on the philosophy that advertising efficiency comes from being truly innovative and naturally engaging to users  Invibes has developed an integrated technology platform for brands to reach consumers through impactful in-feed advertising.Invibes delivers advertising that creates positive attention by harnessing the power of big data  innovative in-feed formats  wide reach and extensive intelligence services.Pioneering the way in sustainable advertising  Invibes also offers a unique solution to offset campaign emissions through its Carbon-Neutral label.In order to partner with some of the greatest brands in the world  like Amazon  Bacardi  Dell  IKEA and Toyota  we rely on even greater people.

A larger pivotal study began in October 2023. A larger pivotal study  designed to accelerate entry into the world's leading varicose vein treatment market  began in October 2023. Treatment has begun at the four study centers in Europe and the United States  and over two-thirds of patients have been treated to date. Study results will be available after a 12-month follow-up period  in accordance with the protocol approved by the Food & Drug Administration (FDA). U.S. marketing authorization is expected following review by early 2026.The foundations of value creation: R&D and AISignificant progress has been made in developing new technological building blocks  notably in artificial intelligence  robotics and acoustics.

In application of IAS 8 ""Accounting policies  changes in accounting estimates and errors""  VPM's consolidated financial statements have therefore been treated retrospectively for this error correction. The total impact on shareholders' equity at December 31  2022 is a negative €4.4 million.The Group's financial structure has been strengthened  with shareholders' equity reaching €419.7 million (+€10.1 million)  or 31.4% of the balance sheet total. Net financial debt rose slightly by 1.5% to 656.1 M€ at December 31  2023  as raw material prices for the 2022 and 2023 harvests rose by more than 20%.The impact on working capital requirements has been limited by optimized inventory management.Inventories of €654.9m fully cover the €635.5m of net financial debt restated for the €20.6m related to the application of IFRS 16.« Société à Mission »In 2023  the Mission Committee had chosen to focus on reducing its greenhouse gas emissions  and thus join the ""zero net emissions"" trajectory by 2050 defined by the United Nations  with an intermediate reduction target of 10% by 2025.Key measures for 2023:- Continued conversion of the vehicle fleet to electric (72% by the end of 2023)- Expansion of our photovoltaic plant in Portugal and development of new projects at our Champagne and Camargue sites.- Installation of a compressor heat recovery system at the Tours-sur-Marne site- Installation of a substation-based building heating control system- Automation and conversion of cellar lighting to LEDs- Involvement of suppliers in our efforts to reduce CO2 emissions.New initiatives will gradually be added to those already underway.In 2024  the Mission Committee wanted to highlight actions to preserve biodiversity in our vineyards.The Group has been integrating this dimension for several years  with the installation of beehives  the development of eco-pasturing in Champagne  Camargue and Provence  the use of falcons and Harris buzzards in the Clos Pompadour in Reims to protect them from starlings.Other actions include the elimination of herbicides and the organic conversion of vineyards in Provence  Camargue and Portugal.Always attentive to changing consumer expectations for more responsible and sustainable wines  the group innovates with the creation of La Félicité 9°  which marks a breakthrough in the production of rosé wines. This low alcohol level is obtained in a totally natural way  without any intervention to reduce it artificially  while preserving the freshness and inimitable taste of Camargue wines.OutlookAfter the resumption of convivial moments in 2021 and 2022 following the pandemic of 2020  the year 2023 was marked in Champagne by inflation. Announced price increases led to overstocking of customers before March 1  2023. The year 2024 should be less affected by the erratic movements of the recent past  and return to volumes comparable to those of 2019 and the previous decade.Against this backdrop  we do not anticipate any increase in volume  but rather the continued deployment of our value-creation strategy.The expected prospect of lower key interest rates should have a slightly positive impact on the Group's financial expenses in 2024  and a more significant one in the medium term.As the ""bubbles"" of celebration for exceptional moments  Champagne retains the unique attachment and loyalty of its clientele  who continue to give it a prominent place in life's happy events.To mark the 150th anniversary of the creation of history's first brut Champagne by Madame Pommery in 1874  the Group has created the cuvée Pommery Apanage Brut 1874. This new cuvée is a blend of three great vintages 2018  2015 and 2012 and the perpetual reserve of the House of Pommery & Greno. Pommery Apanage Brut 1874 is the privileged link between Maison Pommery  gastronomy and the grand hôtellerie.DividendAt its Annual General Meeting on June 6  2024  Vranken-Pommery Monopole will propose the payment of a dividend in respect of the 2023 financial year of €0.80 per share. This dividend will be paid on September 25  2024  and would correspond to a gross yield of 5.11% based on the share price on March 26  2024.Next releaseFiling of universal registration document 2023: April 17  2024.About Vranken-Pommery MonopoleVranken-Pommery Monopole manages 2 600 hectares of land  owned outright or under lease and spread over four vineyards in Champagne  Provence  Camargue and Douro.

H1 of 2023 was marked by a growth slowdown in the digital advertising sector  followed by two consecutive quarters of sales growth during the second half  benefiting from the sector's renewed vigour.Business in the countries where Invibes has been established for the longest (France  Spain  and Switzerland) remained stable in the second half of the year  a remarkable performance after the difficult conditions of the first half of the year. This limited the decline to 13% for the year.Countries in the scale-up phase (Germany  the UK  Italy  and Belgium) are recording accelerated growth between H1 and H2  with total growth of +32% in 2023.The new countries in the start-up phase (Sweden  Norway  Denmark  South Africa  Netherlands  UAE  Poland  Czech Republic) crossed the threshold of nearly one million euros in sales for the first time in 2023.Return to positive EBITDA and net profit by 2023The rapid measures to reduce its cost structure  implemented by Invibes from the second half of 2022 to accompany growth slowdown in the advertising market over the period have successfully borne fruit in 2023. These measures  combined with the return to sales growth since Q3 2023  have enabled Invibes to meet its objective in returning to profitable growth in 2023.Recurring EBITDA (REBITDA) amounted therefore to €2.0m in 2023  compared with -€1.1m in 2022  representing an increase of €3.2m between the two financial years.After accounting for non-current expenses  EBITDA was €2.0m in 2023  compared with-€4.5m in 2022  which included costs relating to the restructuring undertaken in the second half of 2022.The breakdown of EBITDA by country maturity is as follows:Audited consolidated figures in €K 2023 2022 Δ Existing countries (1) Sales figures 17 267 (2) 19 892 -13 2% EBITDA 5 198 5 131 +1 3% % EBITDA 30% 26% Scale-up (3) Sales figures 9 927 7 538 +31 7% EBITDA 1 902 (640) n/a % EBITDA 19% n/a New countries (start-up) (4) Sales figures 973 536 +81 5% EBITDA (579) (1 529) n/a % EBITDA n/a n/a Discontinued operations (5) Sales figures 701 - n/a EBITDA 17 - n/a Group overheads (6) (4 567) (7 470) -38 9% Consolidated EBITDA 1 971 (4 508) +6 479 €(1) France  Spain  Switzerland(2) The ML2Grow business has been restated as a discontinued operation following its disposal in March 2024(3) Germany  United Kingdom  Italy  and Belgium(4) Sweden  Norway  Denmark  South Africa  Netherlands  UAE  Poland  and Czech Republic(5) Corresponds to ML2Grow sold in March 2024(6) Excluding CAPEXDespite a fall in activity in the countries where Invibes has been established the longest (France  Spain  Switzerland)  EBITDA rose slightly  enabling the margin to increase by 4 points to 30% of sales  demonstrating the resilience of the model when a market is mature and established and all the fundamentals are activated  despite difficult market conditions.EBITDA in countries in the scale-up phase rose sharply in 2023 to reach 19% of sales  illustrating the strength of Invibes' international development model  which is based on its ability to roll out its activity rapidly and successfully in a new country so that it becomes a contributor to profitability in less than two years after its launch.After reaching the threshold of nearly one million in sales during 2023  the new countries recently opened (start-ups) will rapidly benefit  like the scale-ups  from the strength of the model and increase their contribution to the Group's profitability.It should be noted that ML2Grow was sold in March 2024 and is therefore accounted for as a discontinued operation. The purpose of acquiring the company in 2019 was to strengthen Invibes' machine learning capabilities to further analyse data using AI. Through knowledge transfer  the ML2Grow team has helped us take our AI initiatives forward. We thank them and wish them all the best.Operating profit and net profit also returned to positive territory.Including depreciation and amortisation of €1.3m  Invibes posted an operating profit of €0.6m. After including a financial charge of €0.6m and a tax credit of €0.6m relating to the capitalisation of deferred tax  net profit came to €0.6m.Between 2022 and 2023  operating profit and net profit have risen by €8.3m and €8.5m respectively  demonstrating the Group's ability to adapt its costs rapidly to changes in its business and maintain sustained profitability  without penalising its capacity for innovation or its ability to win new business.As of 31 December 2023  Invibes had a solid financial structure  with net cash of €10.8m and shareholders' equity of €21.7m.Outlook for 2024Once again buoyed by a recovering digital advertising market  Invibes has entered 2024 with more favourable parameters.To increase the density of its cross-market offer and meet the demand of its international key account customers looking for a global offer  Invibes intends to extend its geographical footprint with the opening of 3 new markets  the United States  Mexico  and Singapore.On the strength of its ability to model the ROI of launching a new country  Invibes expects these new markets to contribute to business a few months after their launch and then to the group's profitability within 2 years.In 2024  Invibes is confident that it will continue to grow its business while maintaining positive profitability.Next publication: Q1 2024 sales  on 25 April 2024 (after trading).About Invibes AdvertisingInvibes Advertising (Invibes) is an international technology company specialising in digital advertising innovation.Founded on the philosophy that advertising efficiency comes from being truly innovative and naturally engaging to users  Invibes has developed an integrated technology platform for brands to reach consumers through impactful in-feed advertising.Invibes delivers advertising that creates positive attention by harnessing the power of big data  innovative in-feed formats  wide reach and extensive intelligence services.Pioneering the way in sustainable advertising  Invibes also offers a unique solution to offset campaign emissions through its Carbon-Neutral label.In order to partner with some of the greatest brands in the world  like Amazon  Bacardi  Dell  IKEA and Toyota  we rely on even greater people.

The total impact on shareholders' equity at December 31  2022 is a negative €4.4 million.The Group's financial structure has been strengthened  with shareholders' equity reaching €419.7 million (+€10.1 million)  or 31.4% of the balance sheet total. Net financial debt rose slightly by 1.5% to 656.1 M€ at December 31  2023  as raw material prices for the 2022 and 2023 harvests rose by more than 20%.The impact on working capital requirements has been limited by optimized inventory management.Inventories of €654.9m fully cover the €635.5m of net financial debt restated for the €20.6m related to the application of IFRS 16.« Société à Mission »In 2023  the Mission Committee had chosen to focus on reducing its greenhouse gas emissions  and thus join the ""zero net emissions"" trajectory by 2050 defined by the United Nations  with an intermediate reduction target of 10% by 2025.Key measures for 2023:- Continued conversion of the vehicle fleet to electric (72% by the end of 2023)- Expansion of our photovoltaic plant in Portugal and development of new projects at our Champagne and Camargue sites.- Installation of a compressor heat recovery system at the Tours-sur-Marne site- Installation of a substation-based building heating control system- Automation and conversion of cellar lighting to LEDs- Involvement of suppliers in our efforts to reduce CO2 emissions.New initiatives will gradually be added to those already underway.In 2024  the Mission Committee wanted to highlight actions to preserve biodiversity in our vineyards.The Group has been integrating this dimension for several years  with the installation of beehives  the development of eco-pasturing in Champagne  Camargue and Provence  the use of falcons and Harris buzzards in the Clos Pompadour in Reims to protect them from starlings.Other actions include the elimination of herbicides and the organic conversion of vineyards in Provence  Camargue and Portugal.Always attentive to changing consumer expectations for more responsible and sustainable wines  the group innovates with the creation of La Félicité 9°  which marks a breakthrough in the production of rosé wines. This low alcohol level is obtained in a totally natural way  without any intervention to reduce it artificially  while preserving the freshness and inimitable taste of Camargue wines.OutlookAfter the resumption of convivial moments in 2021 and 2022 following the pandemic of 2020  the year 2023 was marked in Champagne by inflation. Announced price increases led to overstocking of customers before March 1  2023. The year 2024 should be less affected by the erratic movements of the recent past  and return to volumes comparable to those of 2019 and the previous decade.Against this backdrop  we do not anticipate any increase in volume  but rather the continued deployment of our value-creation strategy.The expected prospect of lower key interest rates should have a slightly positive impact on the Group's financial expenses in 2024  and a more significant one in the medium term.As the ""bubbles"" of celebration for exceptional moments  Champagne retains the unique attachment and loyalty of its clientele  who continue to give it a prominent place in life's happy events.To mark the 150th anniversary of the creation of history's first brut Champagne by Madame Pommery in 1874  the Group has created the cuvée Pommery Apanage Brut 1874. This new cuvée is a blend of three great vintages 2018  2015 and 2012 and the perpetual reserve of the House of Pommery & Greno. Pommery Apanage Brut 1874 is the privileged link between Maison Pommery  gastronomy and the grand hôtellerie.DividendAt its Annual General Meeting on June 6  2024  Vranken-Pommery Monopole will propose the payment of a dividend in respect of the 2023 financial year of €0.80 per share.

A larger pivotal study began in October 2023. A larger pivotal study  designed to accelerate entry into the world's leading varicose vein treatment market  began in October 2023. Treatment has begun at the four study centers in Europe and the United States  and over two-thirds of patients have been treated to date. Study results will be available after a 12-month follow-up period  in accordance with the protocol approved by the Food & Drug Administration (FDA). U.S. marketing authorization is expected following review by early 2026.The foundations of value creation: R&D and AISignificant progress has been made in developing new technological building blocks  notably in artificial intelligence  robotics and acoustics. By combining the system's real-time imaging capabilities with robotics  AI algorithms will be implemented in order to automate certain tasks  speed up procedures and considerably simplify interactions between physicians and SONOVEIN®. At the same time  partnerships with a dozen reference centers in Europe are continuing (some of them already account for 100 to 150 treatments a year)  improving treatment protocols andcontributing to the rapid advancement of the technology. Concrete milestones in transformative improvements to SONOVEIN® are expected over the next two years.A successful capital increaseA capital increase of €8.4 M was carried out at the end of May  mainly thanks to the historical shareholders  including notably Furui  a Theraclion SA shareholder since 2016. In addition to an initial investment of €6 M  Furui has committed to further funding of €1 M  subject to Theraclion meeting specific operational targets. An initial payment was made following the launch of the pivotal study in the United States.A new partner to accelerate access to the Chinese marketClose collaboration has been established between Furui and Theraclion in order to conquer the Chinese market. Theraclion has licensed its technologies and brands to Theraclion China  the pre-existing joint venture between the two companies  in return for €3 M fee. Theraclion China was consolidated and restructured in 2023 in order to actively launch its execution plan in early 2024. These advances enabled €2 M in license royalties to be invoiced to Theraclion China for Echopulse® and SONOVEIN® at the end of 2023.Results 2023In K€ 31/12/2022 31/12/2023 Var. % Turnover 1 235 1 822 48% Grants 7 2 -71% Other products 125 2 093 1576% Total Revenues 1 360 3 917 188% COGS (purchase and stocks variation) 466 331 -29% External charges 3 820 2 573 -33% Personnel charges 3 102 3 153 2% Other operational Charges 287 1 014 253% Total operating expenses 7 675 7 070 -8% Operating result -6 314 -3 153 -50% Financial result -8 -1 955 23179% Non recurring result 350 384 10% R&D tax credit -1 002 -1 049 5% Net result -4 971 -3 675 -26%Accounts approved by the Board of Directors on March 26  2023.On the business front  Theraclion focuses on supporting and assisting centers currently using its products in the treatment of their patients and does not devote resources to prospecting for newcustomers. In this context  the company is not currently focusing on generating significant sales but is instead directing its resources primarily towards product and treatment protocol improvements  as well as clinical trials.Theraclion SA reported sales of €1 822 K in 2023  up 48%Instrument sales are up 58% and include the sale of a limited number of systems. Sales of consumables  recurrent in most cases  amounted to €506 K  up 41%  driven by a significant increase in the varicose vein indication  up 61%. In line with its strategy  Theraclion is making SONOVEIN® available to reference centers involved in the development of treatment protocols  while also integrating it into their business practices. Hence  Theraclion's performance on this revenue item in 2023 reflects these treatment centers' favorable adoption of Theraclion's solutions.Operating revenues amounted to €3 917 K  including €2 000 K in royalties from licenses granted to the Theraclion China joint venture.Operating expenses came to €7 070 K  down by €605 K. External expenses came to €2 573 K  compared with €3 820 K in 2022. This decrease is due to a reduction in spending  particularly in the first half of 2023  and to lower R&D spending in 2023.Personnel costs remain at a level comparable with 2022 (+€50 K).Total expenditures on R&D and development of new products amounted to €3.9 M (compared with €4.3 M in 2022). This amount includes people-related expenses and costs incurred for the development and prototyping  the establishment of treatment protocols  and clinical trial in the United States. They are €402 K lower than in 2022  the year in which the FDA feasibility study was carried out and finalized. In addition  the pivotal U.S. study began in the fourth quarter of 2023  with a limited impact on 2023 expenses (€175 K). R&D investments are expected to intensify in 2025 and 2026 until FDA approval is obtained.Theraclion's Hong Kong subsidiary was set up in 2015 in order to address the Asian market with Echopulse®  targeting treatment of fibroadenoma of the breast and thyroid. Given the refocusing on the vein treatment market and on improving the product's design and functionalities  it was decided to restrict the subsidiary's expenditure and short-term commercial ambitions  while continuing to support existing customers and maintain the installed base. The subsidiary's shares and related receivable have been written down by 1 879K€. Taking into account exchange losses  financial interest and charges on marketable securities  net financial income came to a loss of 1 955K€.The research tax credit amounted to €1 049 K at the end of December 2023  compared with €1 001 K in 2022.

Its share in total Group gross profit continued to grow  rising from 67% in 2022 (reported) to 69.3% in 2023. Meanwhile  offline businesses fell 10.6% over the financial year.In France  business was down by 3% in 2023. This decrease is mainly due to the sharp decline in marketing and communication consulting businesses and in multi-retailer ad selling  which was partly offset by the strong performance of coupon clearing at the end of the year. France represented 87.8% of the Group’s gross profit over the financial year.

Fimalac and Attestor)  the Casino group benefited from accelerated bankruptcy protection measures.Moreover  as part of its takeover deal  Casino announced its plans to sell virtually all of its hypermarkets and supermarkets. On 24 January 2024  Casino then announced that it had signed agreements with Auchan Retail and Groupement Les Mousquetaires (Intermarché) to carry out the official sale in the second quarter of 2024.Since the announcement  HighCo has been in talks with Casino concerning the impact of the sale of its hypermarkets and supermarkets on its current contracts.As the main contract with this client is in effect until the end of 2026  current discussions aim to define a new framework for collaboration as of the second half of 2024  in particular with the retailers Franprix and Monoprix.As negotiations stand  HighCo forecasts a significant decline in its gross profit from this client as of Q2 2024.HIGHCO: ACTOR IN THE TRANSFORMATION OF RETAILIn continuity with 2022  the consumer goods market was disrupted by high inflation for food products in 2023. This increase in prices has had two direct consequences:Strong pressure on purchasing power   which forced consumers to change their consumption habits;  which forced consumers to change their consumption habits; A price war between large retailers  which accelerated the shift towards concentration at work in this business sector.In this unique context  HighCo has put all its expertise into meeting the specific needs of brands and retailers to consolidate and develop their market share.Retailers focus most of their attention on price  but this aspect is not enough to develop their chains effectively. They must also improve their traffic generation  both in stores and e-commerce  and collect data  as retail chain E.Leclerc did with HighCo through its many gaming campaigns launched in 2023. Retailers are also careful in their communication to enhance their reputation and build ties with consumers. In 2023  HighCo teamed up with the advertising agency Ogilvy (WPP) and won the bid to handle the communication for Netto  a retailer in Les Mousquetaires group. Lastly  retailers increasingly need to improve their use of technology to achieve efficiency gains. In this area  Carrefour set up the HighCo Merely platform to manage promotional campaigns simply and collaboratively.Meanwhile  national brands are trying to move upmarket in response to the drop in their volumes and ramp-up of private label and discount brands. In 2023  manufacturers such as Kellogg’s enlisted HighCo to support the launch of product innovations with promotional campaigns. Others  including Procter & Gamble  drew on the Group’s expertise to try to re-establish their relationship with consumers. In its Mobile businesses  brands like Longchamp called on HighCo subsidiary Useradgents to redesign their website and offer their customers a smoother  more comprehensive digital experience.Brands also increased their communication via SMS marketing  as HighCo beat a new record with 1.36 billion messages sent in 2023 (up 95% since 2020).Brands used promotions  and specifically HighCo’s know-how  to adapt to market changes. Consumers considerably benefited from promotions managed by HighCo. In 2023  the Group registered a 142% increase in participation in cashback offers (refunds  games  gifts).Discount coupons are also on an upward trend  with an increase in the volume of coupons processed in France of 9% over the year. In coupons  two trends currently stand out for the Group:HighCo is fully benefiting from growth in paperless coupons and processes 100% of coupon volumes for E.Leclerc   Carrefour and Auchan ;and processes 100% of coupon volumes for   and ; Universal mobile discount coupons continue to be rolled out in stores; HighCo also signed an agreement with Monoprix to enable all of its stores to accept these new coupons as of the second half of 2024.International business leveraged the effects of two innovations:In Belgium   HighCo developed a new format for multi-brand promotions by way of programmatic campaigns ;  HighCo developed a new format for multi-brand promotions by way of ; In Spain  to enhance the consumer experience  the Group developed cashback offers accessible via chatbot available online and through WhatsApp.CSR STRATEGYIn 2023  HighCo strengthened its CSR commitments by:Defining a new CSR strategy    Carrying out a full carbon footprint assessment to define a decarbonisation pathway  andto define a decarbonisation pathway  and Continuing its actions to create greater employee engagement.This new CSR strategy helped to define the Group’s area of engagement: “Moving towards more sustainable marketing”This area of engagement is structured around three pillars:Foster a culture that promotes employee fulfilment and performance;Design sustainable marketing and communication solutions;Guarantee a high level of data security.HighCo also continued its actions to improve HR and social performance  in particular with:Achievement of all its performance indicators;Maintained balance of women in management (50.7% at end-2023);(50.7% at end-2023); Renewal of the EcoVadis Gold rating  placing HighCo in the top 5% of companies in terms of CSR performance and responsible purchasing.The Group’s climate action included two new projects in 2023:Its first full carbon footprint assessment (Scopes 1  2 and 3)  with total greenhouse gas emissions of 7 218 tonnes of CO₂ equivalent in 2023 (down from 2022);(Scopes 1  2 and 3)  with total greenhouse gas emissions of 7 218 tonnes of CO₂ equivalent in 2023 (down from 2022); First submission of the CDP (Carbon Disclosure Project) questionnaire.Lastly  this year was noteworthy for the strong engagement of employees and the Management Committee in CSR issues  including:awareness initiatives around climate action for all Management Committee members through the 2Tonnes workshop and for employees through France’s “fresk” workshops (climate  mobility  etc.);for all Management Committee members through the workshop and for employees through France’s workshops (climate  mobility  etc.); The first European Sustainability Week organised by the Group;organised by the Group; Ongoing internal events organised by organisations promoting the environment  Hagir  and sports  OHC.In 2024  HighCo plans to pursue initiatives already under way  while deploying its CSR and decarbonisation action plans to meet its target: “to lead by example in terms of HR  social and environmental performance”.2024 GUIDANCEGiven the current situation with Casino and the information known at this time  HighCo announces the following forecasts for 2024:Decrease in gross profit of about 10% (2023 gross profit: €74.35 m);(2023 gross profit: €74.35 m); Operating margin (headline PBIT/gross profit) of more than 15% (2023 operating margin: 22.1%);The Group’s financial resources will be allocated to:Shareholder returns with a dividend payout of €0.20 per share (€0.40 per share paid in 2023 in respect of FY 2022) and the continued share buyback programme involving approximately €1 m (2023: €2.15 m);(€0.40 per share paid in 2023 in respect of FY 2022) and the continued involving approximately €1 m (2023: €2.15 m); Capital expenditure  expected at less than €1 m (2023: €1.93 m);Acceleration of the CSR strategy.ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING OF 21 MAY 2024HighCo’s joint Annual General Meeting will be held at the head office in Aix-en-Provence on 21 May 2024 at 11 a.m. (CET).

Meanwhile  offline businesses fell 10.6% over the financial year.In France  business was down by 3% in 2023. This decrease is mainly due to the sharp decline in marketing and communication consulting businesses and in multi-retailer ad selling  which was partly offset by the strong performance of coupon clearing at the end of the year. France represented 87.8% of the Group’s gross profit over the financial year. Digital businesses were on a positive trend  rising 1.8% over the financial year  and their share increased significantly to 70.8% of gross profit. Accounting for one-quarter of business activities in France  Mobile tapered slightly in 2023 (down 1.5%) against a high 2022 comparative base (double-digit growth in 2022). Offline businesses showed a 13% decline over the year.International business held up well and fell slightly by 0.6% to €9.09 m for the 2023 financial year  accounting for 12.2% of the Group’s gross profit.

As a reminder  other operating income and expenses in 2022 mainly correspond to the partial goodwill impairment of Belgian businesses  totalling €7.36 m.Financial income in 2023 totalled €1.02 m  up by €1.25 m  mainly due to income from cash (€1.27 m).The tax expense amounted to €4.72 m in 2023 (2022 adjusted: expense of €4.28 m). The effective tax rate was down by 160 basis points to come out at 28%.Income from assets held for sale and discontinued operations stood at €0.45 m for 2023 (2022 restated: income of €0.38 m) mainly due to the discontinuation of businesses in Italy.Adjusted attributable net income rose significantly by 20.9% to €10.9 m (2022 restated: €9.02 m).

Excluding operating working capital (€46.74 m at 31 December 2023)  net cash came to €19.39 m  up €0.34 m from 31 December 2022  mainly due to high shareholder returns (dividend payout and share buybacks) totalling €11.7 m for the year.CHANGES IN THE RELATIONSHIP WITH CASINO IN THE CONTEXT OF ITS RESTRUCTURINGFollowing a conciliation procedure in 2023  which led to an agreement for its takeover by new shareholders (EP Global Commerce a.s.  Fimalac and Attestor)  the Casino group benefited from accelerated bankruptcy protection measures.Moreover  as part of its takeover deal  Casino announced its plans to sell virtually all of its hypermarkets and supermarkets. On 24 January 2024  Casino then announced that it had signed agreements with Auchan Retail and Groupement Les Mousquetaires (Intermarché) to carry out the official sale in the second quarter of 2024.Since the announcement  HighCo has been in talks with Casino concerning the impact of the sale of its hypermarkets and supermarkets on its current contracts.As the main contract with this client is in effect until the end of 2026  current discussions aim to define a new framework for collaboration as of the second half of 2024  in particular with the retailers Franprix and Monoprix.As negotiations stand  HighCo forecasts a significant decline in its gross profit from this client as of Q2 2024.HIGHCO: ACTOR IN THE TRANSFORMATION OF RETAILIn continuity with 2022  the consumer goods market was disrupted by high inflation for food products in 2023. This increase in prices has had two direct consequences:Strong pressure on purchasing power   which forced consumers to change their consumption habits;  which forced consumers to change their consumption habits; A price war between large retailers  which accelerated the shift towards concentration at work in this business sector.In this unique context  HighCo has put all its expertise into meeting the specific needs of brands and retailers to consolidate and develop their market share.Retailers focus most of their attention on price  but this aspect is not enough to develop their chains effectively. They must also improve their traffic generation  both in stores and e-commerce  and collect data  as retail chain E.Leclerc did with HighCo through its many gaming campaigns launched in 2023. Retailers are also careful in their communication to enhance their reputation and build ties with consumers. In 2023  HighCo teamed up with the advertising agency Ogilvy (WPP) and won the bid to handle the communication for Netto  a retailer in Les Mousquetaires group. Lastly  retailers increasingly need to improve their use of technology to achieve efficiency gains. In this area  Carrefour set up the HighCo Merely platform to manage promotional campaigns simply and collaboratively.Meanwhile  national brands are trying to move upmarket in response to the drop in their volumes and ramp-up of private label and discount brands. In 2023  manufacturers such as Kellogg’s enlisted HighCo to support the launch of product innovations with promotional campaigns. Others  including Procter & Gamble  drew on the Group’s expertise to try to re-establish their relationship with consumers. In its Mobile businesses  brands like Longchamp called on HighCo subsidiary Useradgents to redesign their website and offer their customers a smoother  more comprehensive digital experience.Brands also increased their communication via SMS marketing  as HighCo beat a new record with 1.36 billion messages sent in 2023 (up 95% since 2020).Brands used promotions  and specifically HighCo’s know-how  to adapt to market changes. Consumers considerably benefited from promotions managed by HighCo. In 2023  the Group registered a 142% increase in participation in cashback offers (refunds  games  gifts).Discount coupons are also on an upward trend  with an increase in the volume of coupons processed in France of 9% over the year. In coupons  two trends currently stand out for the Group:HighCo is fully benefiting from growth in paperless coupons and processes 100% of coupon volumes for E.Leclerc   Carrefour and Auchan ;and processes 100% of coupon volumes for   and ; Universal mobile discount coupons continue to be rolled out in stores; HighCo also signed an agreement with Monoprix to enable all of its stores to accept these new coupons as of the second half of 2024.International business leveraged the effects of two innovations:In Belgium   HighCo developed a new format for multi-brand promotions by way of programmatic campaigns ;  HighCo developed a new format for multi-brand promotions by way of ; In Spain  to enhance the consumer experience  the Group developed cashback offers accessible via chatbot available online and through WhatsApp.CSR STRATEGYIn 2023  HighCo strengthened its CSR commitments by:Defining a new CSR strategy    Carrying out a full carbon footprint assessment to define a decarbonisation pathway  andto define a decarbonisation pathway  and Continuing its actions to create greater employee engagement.This new CSR strategy helped to define the Group’s area of engagement: “Moving towards more sustainable marketing”This area of engagement is structured around three pillars:Foster a culture that promotes employee fulfilment and performance;Design sustainable marketing and communication solutions;Guarantee a high level of data security.HighCo also continued its actions to improve HR and social performance  in particular with:Achievement of all its performance indicators;Maintained balance of women in management (50.7% at end-2023);(50.7% at end-2023); Renewal of the EcoVadis Gold rating  placing HighCo in the top 5% of companies in terms of CSR performance and responsible purchasing.The Group’s climate action included two new projects in 2023:Its first full carbon footprint assessment (Scopes 1  2 and 3)  with total greenhouse gas emissions of 7 218 tonnes of CO₂ equivalent in 2023 (down from 2022);(Scopes 1  2 and 3)  with total greenhouse gas emissions of 7 218 tonnes of CO₂ equivalent in 2023 (down from 2022); First submission of the CDP (Carbon Disclosure Project) questionnaire.Lastly  this year was noteworthy for the strong engagement of employees and the Management Committee in CSR issues  including:awareness initiatives around climate action for all Management Committee members through the 2Tonnes workshop and for employees through France’s “fresk” workshops (climate  mobility  etc.);for all Management Committee members through the workshop and for employees through France’s workshops (climate  mobility  etc.); The first European Sustainability Week organised by the Group;organised by the Group; Ongoing internal events organised by organisations promoting the environment  Hagir  and sports  OHC.In 2024  HighCo plans to pursue initiatives already under way  while deploying its CSR and decarbonisation action plans to meet its target: “to lead by example in terms of HR  social and environmental performance”.2024 GUIDANCEGiven the current situation with Casino and the information known at this time  HighCo announces the following forecasts for 2024:Decrease in gross profit of about 10% (2023 gross profit: €74.35 m);(2023 gross profit: €74.35 m); Operating margin (headline PBIT/gross profit) of more than 15% (2023 operating margin: 22.1%);The Group’s financial resources will be allocated to:Shareholder returns with a dividend payout of €0.20 per share (€0.40 per share paid in 2023 in respect of FY 2022) and the continued share buyback programme involving approximately €1 m (2023: €2.15 m);(€0.40 per share paid in 2023 in respect of FY 2022) and the continued involving approximately €1 m (2023: €2.15 m); Capital expenditure  expected at less than €1 m (2023: €1.93 m);Acceleration of the CSR strategy.ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING OF 21 MAY 2024HighCo’s joint Annual General Meeting will be held at the head office in Aix-en-Provence on 21 May 2024 at 11 a.m. (CET).

See details below.Strasbourg  France  March 27  2024  5:45 p.m. CET – Transgene (Euronext Paris: TNG)  a biotech company that designs and develops virus-based immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer  today publishes its financial results for 2023  and provides an update on its product pipeline and upcoming plans.“During 2023 Transgene continued to make significant progress  delivering compelling data that confirm the value of our approach to treating cancer using our novel immunotherapies” commented Dr. Alessandro Riva  MD  Chairman and CEO of Transgene.“At the upcoming AACR conference in April 2024  we will be presenting additional data from the randomized Phase I study in adjuvant head and neck cancer for our lead therapeutic cancer vaccine  TG4050. Together with our partner NEC we are expanding the Phase I trial in a randomized Phase I/II to further strengthen the initial data in a larger patient population and set the foundation for a registrational development strategy.”“In the second half of 2024 we anticipate the first topline data from our fully enrolled randomized Phase II trial evaluating our shared antigens cancer vaccine TG4001 in HPV-positive anogenital cancers.”“Together with expected Phase I data from our oncolytic virus programs BT-001 and TG6050 this promises to be a key year for Transgene  with further important milestones in 2025 that we believe will enhance the value of our platform. Backed by our extended financial visibility and our strong management team we are confident in our ability to achieve our ambitious goals of delivering transformative therapies for cancer patients. I look forward to sharing updates on our continued progress.”Key events and upcoming milestonesNeoantigen therapeutic cancer vaccine (TG4050)Additional data from the randomized Phase I trial in adjuvant head and neck cancer to be presented in H1 2024 The trial will be expanded in a randomized Phase I/II trial in the same indication. The Phase II part will start in Q2 2024.In 2023  highly promising TG4050 data were presented at AACR and ASCO 2023 (see poster here ). These data show that this individualized neoantigen cancer vaccine can induce strong immune responses  which are expected to result in longer remission periods for patients.The initial data from the randomized Phase I trial in the adjuvant treatment of head and neck cancer (NCT04183166) presented at ASCO showed that all evaluable patients treated with TG4050 developed a robust and specific immune response against multiple cancer neoantigens and remained disease-free.These data suggest that TG4050 can boost the immune system of patients despite a challenging tumor microenvironment at the time of tumor resection.Transgene and its partner NEC plan to report updated data at AACR (poster presentation on April-10  2024) and the additional data on the 24-month median follow up of patients in H2 2024.The randomized Phase I trial will be expanded to a randomized Phase I/II trial in the adjuvant setting of head and neck cancer. The Phase II part is expected to start enrolling patients in Q2 2024 within the framework of an extended collaboration between Transgene and NEC.TG4050 has potential applicability across a range of solid tumors where the medical need is still significant despite the existing therapeutic option including immunotherapies. As a consequence  Transgene is performing preliminary work on a potential new Phase I trial in another undisclosed indication.Shared antigens cancer vaccine (TG4001)Transgene has completed the enrollment of 86 patients in the ongoing randomized Phase II trial evaluating TG4001 in HPV-positive anogenital cancers (NCT03260023). Transgene confirms that top line readouts are expected in H2 2024.In 2023  immunological response data from TG4001 were presented in a poster at ASCO  confirming that TG4001 can induce de novo immune responses against HPV16 antigens E6 and E7 in patients with advanced HPV16-positive anogenital cancers. Patients with a complete objective response showed strong vaccine-induced immunoreactivity.Promising results from the previous Phase I/II trial evaluating TG4001 in combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor were published in the September 2023 issue of the European Journal of Cancer ( https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejca.2023.112981 ). This study showed that TG4001 in combination with avelumab is safe and demonstrated antitumor activity in heavily pretreated HPV16-positive cancer patients. It also served as the basis for the ongoing randomized Phase II trial.Oncolytic VirusesIn 2023  clinical data presented at AACR confirmed the mechanism of action and the safety of our Invir.IO® based oncolytic viruses  which offer a key competitive advantage with the ability to be administered intravenously. These findings support the potential of Invir.IO®-based oncolytic viruses to have multiple treatment applications in a broad range of solid tumors  via intravenous  locoregional and intratumoral administration.TG6050: Initial Phase I data expected in H2 2024  from this novel Invir.IO® candidate administered intravenouslyA first patient was dosed with TG6050  a novel oncolytic virus from Transgene’s Invir.IO® platform  in 2023. This innovative candidate has been designed to express human IL-12  a cytokine known to trigger a potent antitumor immune response  and an anti-CTLA4 antibody. The Phase I Delivir trial (NCT05788926) is evaluating TG6050 in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer who have failed standard therapeutic options. Initial data from the trial is expected in H2 2024.BT-001: Positive single agent data — Part B of the Phase I trial (combination with pembrolizumab) to deliver initial data in H2 2024Transgene and its partner BioInvent have communicated positive data from Part A (monotherapy) of the ongoing Phase I trial in May 2023 (NCT04725331). Out of 18 patients who received escalating intratumoral doses of BT-001  two showed a decrease of injected lesion size of 50% or more  and eleven had a stabilization of the injected lesion. No safety concerns were reported.Part B of the Phase I trial in combination with pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA®) started in October 2023. KEYTRUDA® is provided by MSD (Merck & Co). Initial data from this part of the trial are expected in H2 2024.As announced on May 5  2023  AstraZeneca terminated its oncolytic virus research and development collaboration with Transgene following a strategic review of its pipeline.All clinical assets are expected to deliver important data in 2024In 2024  Transgene expects to communicate progress and significant results and readout on all of its clinical stage assets.TG4050 Randomized Phase I trial (head and neck): Poster presentationAdditional dataApril 10  2024 (AACR)H2 2024 Randomized Phase II to start (head and neck) H1 2024 Preliminary work to launch additional Phase I trial 2024 TG4001 Randomized Phase II: topline results H2 2024 TG6050 Initial data from Phase I trial H2 2024 BT-001 Initial data from combination part of Phase I H2 2024New leadership structure appointed to accelerate the development of Transgene’s innovative immunotherapy portfolioOn May 5  2023  Transgene announced its Board of Directors’ decision to appoint Dr. Alessandro Riva  MD  as the Company’s Chairman and CEO.

See details below.Strasbourg  France  March 27  2024  5:45 p.m. CET – Transgene (Euronext Paris: TNG)  a biotech company that designs and develops virus-based immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer  today publishes its financial results for 2023  and provides an update on its product pipeline and upcoming plans.“During 2023 Transgene continued to make significant progress  delivering compelling data that confirm the value of our approach to treating cancer using our novel immunotherapies” commented Dr. Alessandro Riva  MD  Chairman and CEO of Transgene.“At the upcoming AACR conference in April 2024  we will be presenting additional data from the randomized Phase I study in adjuvant head and neck cancer for our lead therapeutic cancer vaccine  TG4050. Together with our partner NEC we are expanding the Phase I trial in a randomized Phase I/II to further strengthen the initial data in a larger patient population and set the foundation for a registrational development strategy.”“In the second half of 2024 we anticipate the first topline data from our fully enrolled randomized Phase II trial evaluating our shared antigens cancer vaccine TG4001 in HPV-positive anogenital cancers.”“Together with expected Phase I data from our oncolytic virus programs BT-001 and TG6050 this promises to be a key year for Transgene  with further important milestones in 2025 that we believe will enhance the value of our platform. Backed by our extended financial visibility and our strong management team we are confident in our ability to achieve our ambitious goals of delivering transformative therapies for cancer patients. I look forward to sharing updates on our continued progress.”Key events and upcoming milestonesNeoantigen therapeutic cancer vaccine (TG4050)Additional data from the randomized Phase I trial in adjuvant head and neck cancer to be presented in H1 2024 The trial will be expanded in a randomized Phase I/II trial in the same indication. The Phase II part will start in Q2 2024.In 2023  highly promising TG4050 data were presented at AACR and ASCO 2023 (see poster here ). These data show that this individualized neoantigen cancer vaccine can induce strong immune responses  which are expected to result in longer remission periods for patients.The initial data from the randomized Phase I trial in the adjuvant treatment of head and neck cancer (NCT04183166) presented at ASCO showed that all evaluable patients treated with TG4050 developed a robust and specific immune response against multiple cancer neoantigens and remained disease-free.These data suggest that TG4050 can boost the immune system of patients despite a challenging tumor microenvironment at the time of tumor resection.Transgene and its partner NEC plan to report updated data at AACR (poster presentation on April-10  2024) and the additional data on the 24-month median follow up of patients in H2 2024.The randomized Phase I trial will be expanded to a randomized Phase I/II trial in the adjuvant setting of head and neck cancer. The Phase II part is expected to start enrolling patients in Q2 2024 within the framework of an extended collaboration between Transgene and NEC.TG4050 has potential applicability across a range of solid tumors where the medical need is still significant despite the existing therapeutic option including immunotherapies. As a consequence  Transgene is performing preliminary work on a potential new Phase I trial in another undisclosed indication.Shared antigens cancer vaccine (TG4001)Transgene has completed the enrollment of 86 patients in the ongoing randomized Phase II trial evaluating TG4001 in HPV-positive anogenital cancers (NCT03260023). Transgene confirms that top line readouts are expected in H2 2024.In 2023  immunological response data from TG4001 were presented in a poster at ASCO  confirming that TG4001 can induce de novo immune responses against HPV16 antigens E6 and E7 in patients with advanced HPV16-positive anogenital cancers. Patients with a complete objective response showed strong vaccine-induced immunoreactivity.Promising results from the previous Phase I/II trial evaluating TG4001 in combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor were published in the September 2023 issue of the European Journal of Cancer ( https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejca.2023.112981 ). This study showed that TG4001 in combination with avelumab is safe and demonstrated antitumor activity in heavily pretreated HPV16-positive cancer patients. It also served as the basis for the ongoing randomized Phase II trial.Oncolytic VirusesIn 2023  clinical data presented at AACR confirmed the mechanism of action and the safety of our Invir.IO® based oncolytic viruses  which offer a key competitive advantage with the ability to be administered intravenously. These findings support the potential of Invir.IO®-based oncolytic viruses to have multiple treatment applications in a broad range of solid tumors  via intravenous  locoregional and intratumoral administration.TG6050: Initial Phase I data expected in H2 2024  from this novel Invir.IO® candidate administered intravenouslyA first patient was dosed with TG6050  a novel oncolytic virus from Transgene’s Invir.IO® platform  in 2023. This innovative candidate has been designed to express human IL-12  a cytokine known to trigger a potent antitumor immune response  and an anti-CTLA4 antibody. The Phase I Delivir trial (NCT05788926) is evaluating TG6050 in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer who have failed standard therapeutic options. Initial data from the trial is expected in H2 2024.BT-001: Positive single agent data — Part B of the Phase I trial (combination with pembrolizumab) to deliver initial data in H2 2024Transgene and its partner BioInvent have communicated positive data from Part A (monotherapy) of the ongoing Phase I trial in May 2023 (NCT04725331). Out of 18 patients who received escalating intratumoral doses of BT-001  two showed a decrease of injected lesion size of 50% or more  and eleven had a stabilization of the injected lesion. No safety concerns were reported.Part B of the Phase I trial in combination with pembrolizumab (KEYTRUDA®) started in October 2023. KEYTRUDA® is provided by MSD (Merck & Co). Initial data from this part of the trial are expected in H2 2024.As announced on May 5  2023  AstraZeneca terminated its oncolytic virus research and development collaboration with Transgene following a strategic review of its pipeline.All clinical assets are expected to deliver important data in 2024In 2024  Transgene expects to communicate progress and significant results and readout on all of its clinical stage assets.TG4050 Randomized Phase I trial (head and neck): Poster presentationAdditional dataApril 10  2024 (AACR)H2 2024 Randomized Phase II to start (head and neck) H1 2024 Preliminary work to launch additional Phase I trial 2024 TG4001 Randomized Phase II: topline results H2 2024 TG6050 Initial data from Phase I trial H2 2024 BT-001 Initial data from combination part of Phase I H2 2024New leadership structure appointed to accelerate the development of Transgene’s innovative immunotherapy portfolioOn May 5  2023  Transgene announced its Board of Directors’ decision to appoint Dr. Alessandro Riva  MD  as the Company’s Chairman and CEO.

On the one hand  thanks to our technological lead in AI  2023 was our most prolific year to date in new Annual Contract Value terms  achieving €11.2 million. Sidetrade delivered remarkable revenue growth  up 20% at constant exchange rates with a 23% increase in SaaS subscription revenues alone for our Order-to-Cash activities. This performance was underpinned by two key growth drivers; our successful US expansion posting revenues up more than 40%  combined with our business strategy targeting multinationals  which triggered a 48% increase in subscription revenues from this segment. Given the SaaS model's inherent lag between bookings and revenues  the commercial successes of 2023 lead us to confidently anticipate another year of double-digit revenue growth on a full-year basis for the fiscal year 2024.On the other  2023 also saw us considerably step up our investments  especially in the United States  as well as relentlessly focusing on Company-wide productivity and efficiency enhancements. To this end  our efforts to streamline processes coupled with a high gross margin (81%) resulted in a significant surge in our operating profit  up 58% to €5.8 million  with an improvement of almost 3 points in our operating margin  which is now at 13% of our revenue versus 10% in 2022. Evidently  the best example of the Company's successful 2023 performance is its operating cash flow at €8.7 million  a record high over a fiscal year.Looking beyond these figures  Sidetrade's model  which is based on a healthy balance between growth and profitability  has once again demonstrated its relevance against a background of economic uncertainty.""Robustness of the profitable growth model confirmedSidetrade(€m) 2023 2022 Change New Annual Contract Value (ACV) 11.2 10.3 +9% Revenue 43.7 36.8 +19% of which 'Order-to-Cash' SaaS subscriptions 36.6 30.1 +22% Gross margin 35.3 29.0 +22% as a % of Revenue 81% 79% Operating expenses (OPEX) (29.4) (25.3) +16% Operating profit 5.8 3.7 +58% as a % of Revenue 13% 10% Net profit 5.6 3.4 +67%2023 consolidated financial statements were audited and will be certified after finalization of procedures required for the annual financial report.€11.2 million – a new record for bookings in 2023In 2023  despite economic challenges  Sidetrade proved resilient by exceeding its previous record in New Annual Contract Value (ACV)  which totaled €11.2 million  representing an increase of 9%. This performance was driven in particular by the momentum of the US market  with a 22% increase in bookings  accounting for 37% of total bookings.New SaaS bookings generated €6.18 million  remaining stable despite a slight decline of 4% vs. 2022. Sidetrade focused efforts on the sustainability of its revenues  as reflected in an extension to the initial period for new contracts to 45.5 months in 2023. Total Contract Value (TCV) slightly increased to €21.1 million. Services bookings were up 31%  notably thanks to the growing number of global deployment projects.Key factors behind this success were Sidetrade's business strategy targeting companies generating $1 billion-plus revenue  and recognition of its technological edge in artificial intelligence  particularly in the United States. Sidetrade's comprehensive Order-to-Cash solution results from a strategy of continuous innovation.Bookings by new customers (""New Business"") accounted for 58% of the total new bookings  while the remaining 20% and 22% of bookings were respectively driven by cross-selling and upselling of additional modules to existing customers.Strong revenue growth  up 20%  with SaaS subscriptions up 23% at constant exchange ratesIn 2023  Sidetrade posted brisk growth in its activities  as shown by the 23% increase in its revenue for 'Order-to-Cash' SaaS subscriptions at constant exchange rates  a performance which resulted in growth of 22% on a reported basis. The Company's revenue for 2023 totaled €43.7 million  as evidenced by the robust increase of 20% at constant exchange rates and 19% on a reported basis.This favorable trend is largely attributable to three factors:Successful expansion in the United States : the North American market continued to propel Sidetrade's growth  with a substantial increase of 40% in revenues for 2023  reaching €12.1 million. Representing 28% of the Company's total revenue  North America is now a pivotal pillar for growth.: the North American market continued to propel Sidetrade's growth  with a substantial increase of 40% in revenues for 2023  reaching €12.1 million. Representing 28% of the Company's total revenue  North America is now a pivotal pillar for growth. Increasing demand from multinational corporations : in 2023  Sidetrade significantly expanded its customer portfolio for 'Order-to-Cash' solutions  delivering growth of 48% in subscriptions with multinational corporations on annual recurring revenue (ARR) contracts in excess of €250 000. Such commitments now account for 43% of Sidetrade's total subscriptions.: in 2023  Sidetrade significantly expanded its customer portfolio for 'Order-to-Cash' solutions  delivering growth of 48% in subscriptions with multinational corporations on annual recurring revenue (ARR) contracts in excess of €250 000. Such commitments now account for 43% of Sidetrade's total subscriptions. Contribution from consolidating CreditPoint Software: with H2 2023 revenue of €0.9 million  the CreditPoint Software business had a 2% impact on annual growth.It should be noted that all multi-year Sidetrade contracts are routinely indexed to inflation (the Syntec for Southern Europe  the UK CPI for Northern Europe and the US CPI for the United States). This measure alters the total price of SaaS subscriptions each year by reference to changes in these price indices  without the need for contract renewals.CreditPoint Software  an accretive acquisition  now fully operationalOn June 30  2023  Sidetrade bolstered its all-round offering by acquiring the business of CreditPoint Software  an American provider of credit risk management solutions (see press release of July 3  2023). Consolidated into the Company’s financial statements on July 1  2023  this business contributed additional revenue of €0.9 million in H2 2023.All CreditPoint Software employees underwent a fast onboarding process  fostering effective synergies within the Company’s various departments. As a result  the deployment of CreditPoint Software's solution within the single version of Sidetrade's platform will be completed by end-H1 2024  delivering all-new and readily available credit risk management functionalities for initial clientele.The acquisition agreement provided for an initial payment (€0.5 million upon signing) followed by a conditional payment after renewal in October 2023 of CreditPoint Software's main customer (representing around 50% of its revenues). This customer in the agriculture industry accounted for €0.6 million-plus in annual subscriptions. In early October 2023  Sidetrade not only renewed the contract for the same amount (excluding orders specified above) but also extended the initial contractual period from 36 to 60 months  increasing Total Contract Value (TCV) to €3 million. In doing so  Sidetrade issued an earnout for the acquisition  totaling €2 million. Weeks later  Sidetrade convinced this North American leader to deploy additional Sidetrade solutions in both the US and Australia  resulting in an additional contract of the same worth and length. This new contract positions this customer among Sidetrade's top five clients  with ARR in excess of €1 million. Note that no subsequent payment was incurred from this second contract since its remit was outside the scope of acquisition. Upon final settlement  the purchase price will total €2.7 million  including the price to acquire services (€0.2 million).Strong increase in operating margin to 13% with additional investment of €4 millionMarked progress in gross margin  at 81% of revenue  above the SaaS industry averageGross margin further improved  topping out at 81% of revenue for 2023 (vs. 79% in 2022) and 93% (+1 pt vs. 2022) on SaaS subscriptions alone. In 2023  Sidetrade recorded a year-on-year incremental improvement of €6.3 million in gross margin.This excellent performance is fueled by the contribution of SaaS subscriptions which now account for 98% of the Company's total gross margin  a business strategy promoting Sidetrade's technological edge in AI  and tight cost control despite an inflationary environment. Sidetrade continues to demonstrate the profitability of its SaaS model  which generates significant incremental gross margin  year after year.Substantial increase in operating margin to 13% of revenue  despite additional investment of €4 millionOperating profit for 2023 totaled €5.8 million  representing an increase of 58% on the 2022 fiscal year (€3.7 million). In 2023  gross margin  with a €6.3 million increase over 2022  amounts to €35.3 million. The significant increase has more than made it possible to support the Company’s investment policy (+€4.0 million vs. 2022)  while triggering an all-time surge in Sidetrade's operating profit.Operating profit for 2023 includes a French Research Tax Credit of €2.4 million (vs. €2.3 million in 2022) as well as activation of €0.2 million in marginal R&D costs  i.e.  2% of R&D costs for the full year.As a result  operating margin increased to 13% vs. 10% in 2022  representing a 3-point gain year-on-year.Net profit up 67% to €5.6 million vs. €3.4 million in 2022Net financial income for 2023 stood at €0.4 million  up significantly from 2022  mostly due to interest earned on short-term investments during the year.Corporate income tax for 2023 was estimated at €0.6 million  vs. €0.4 million in 2022.All told  Sidetrade's net profit for 2023 was €5.6 million  up 67%  demonstrating that a balance between growth and profitability is achievable.Strengthened financial positionThe fiscal year 2023 enabled the Company to considerably increase its operating cash flow to €8.7 million (vs. €4.0 million in 2022)  representing a record high over a fiscal year.Sidetrade reported €23.9 million in gross cash at year-end  representing an increase of €3.6 million vs. 2022. As of December 31  2023  Sidetrade also held 86 697 of its own shares with a value of €14.0 million.With a financial debt of €10.3 million (reduced by €1.7 million)  Sidetrade increased its investment capacity to accelerate its expansion.Distinguished CSR commitment: rated Gold by EthiFinance and Silver by EcoVadisIn 2023  Sidetrade's commitment to Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) was formally outlined with the publication of its first-ever CSR report. To that end  the Company focused its efforts on four priorities:Sustainability  by implementing initiatives aimed at reducing its carbon footprint;Collaborative excellence  by championing diversity and innovation within its teams;Data security  by safeguarding the protection of data;Ethical business practices  by building relationships founded on transparency and integrity.Much like its initial assessment  Sidetrade's carbon assessment for 2023 (scopes 1  2 and 3) is the result of a rigorous application of the Bilan Carbone® methodology and covers all its worldwide operations. It heralds a new stage in the process to cut greenhouse gas emissions  strengthening Sidetrade's position as a responsible leader in the technology sector.Both EthiFinance and EcoVadis have recognized the accomplishments of Sidetrade's CSR strategy. First  EthiFinance awarded the Company a Gold medal and a score of 76/100. Second  Sidetrade secured a Silver medal with EcoVadis with an overall score of 68/100. The latter places Sidetrade in the top 25% of companies in sectors across the board. These awards underscore the effectiveness of the Company's CSR strategy  reflecting its commitment as a corporate citizen that is ready to face the challenges of today and tomorrow.Continued growth in 2024  on the back of an unprecedented 2023Over the past few quarters  Sidetrade has consolidated its leadership with ambitions to become the world leader in the fast-growing and rapidly globalizing Order-to-Cash market.Sidetrade looks ahead to the fiscal year 2024 with confidence  driven by an ambitious vision  and has the resources to fulfill its targets.

Consolidated into the Company’s financial statements on July 1  2023  this business contributed additional revenue of €0.9 million in H2 2023.All CreditPoint Software employees underwent a fast onboarding process  fostering effective synergies within the Company’s various departments. As a result  the deployment of CreditPoint Software's solution within the single version of Sidetrade's platform will be completed by end-H1 2024  delivering all-new and readily available credit risk management functionalities for initial clientele.The acquisition agreement provided for an initial payment (€0.5 million upon signing) followed by a conditional payment after renewal in October 2023 of CreditPoint Software's main customer (representing around 50% of its revenues). This customer in the agriculture industry accounted for €0.6 million-plus in annual subscriptions. In early October 2023  Sidetrade not only renewed the contract for the same amount (excluding orders specified above) but also extended the initial contractual period from 36 to 60 months  increasing Total Contract Value (TCV) to €3 million. In doing so  Sidetrade issued an earnout for the acquisition  totaling €2 million. Weeks later  Sidetrade convinced this North American leader to deploy additional Sidetrade solutions in both the US and Australia  resulting in an additional contract of the same worth and length. This new contract positions this customer among Sidetrade's top five clients  with ARR in excess of €1 million. Note that no subsequent payment was incurred from this second contract since its remit was outside the scope of acquisition. Upon final settlement  the purchase price will total €2.7 million  including the price to acquire services (€0.2 million).Strong increase in operating margin to 13% with additional investment of €4 millionMarked progress in gross margin  at 81% of revenue  above the SaaS industry averageGross margin further improved  topping out at 81% of revenue for 2023 (vs. 79% in 2022) and 93% (+1 pt vs. 2022) on SaaS subscriptions alone. In 2023  Sidetrade recorded a year-on-year incremental improvement of €6.3 million in gross margin.This excellent performance is fueled by the contribution of SaaS subscriptions which now account for 98% of the Company's total gross margin  a business strategy promoting Sidetrade's technological edge in AI  and tight cost control despite an inflationary environment. Sidetrade continues to demonstrate the profitability of its SaaS model  which generates significant incremental gross margin  year after year.Substantial increase in operating margin to 13% of revenue  despite additional investment of €4 millionOperating profit for 2023 totaled €5.8 million  representing an increase of 58% on the 2022 fiscal year (€3.7 million). In 2023  gross margin  with a €6.3 million increase over 2022  amounts to €35.3 million. The significant increase has more than made it possible to support the Company’s investment policy (+€4.0 million vs. 2022)  while triggering an all-time surge in Sidetrade's operating profit.Operating profit for 2023 includes a French Research Tax Credit of €2.4 million (vs. €2.3 million in 2022) as well as activation of €0.2 million in marginal R&D costs  i.e.  2% of R&D costs for the full year.As a result  operating margin increased to 13% vs. 10% in 2022  representing a 3-point gain year-on-year.Net profit up 67% to €5.6 million vs. €3.4 million in 2022Net financial income for 2023 stood at €0.4 million  up significantly from 2022  mostly due to interest earned on short-term investments during the year.Corporate income tax for 2023 was estimated at €0.6 million  vs. €0.4 million in 2022.All told  Sidetrade's net profit for 2023 was €5.6 million  up 67%  demonstrating that a balance between growth and profitability is achievable.Strengthened financial positionThe fiscal year 2023 enabled the Company to considerably increase its operating cash flow to €8.7 million (vs. €4.0 million in 2022)  representing a record high over a fiscal year.Sidetrade reported €23.9 million in gross cash at year-end  representing an increase of €3.6 million vs. 2022. As of December 31  2023  Sidetrade also held 86 697 of its own shares with a value of €14.0 million.With a financial debt of €10.3 million (reduced by €1.7 million)  Sidetrade increased its investment capacity to accelerate its expansion.Distinguished CSR commitment: rated Gold by EthiFinance and Silver by EcoVadisIn 2023  Sidetrade's commitment to Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) was formally outlined with the publication of its first-ever CSR report. To that end  the Company focused its efforts on four priorities:Sustainability  by implementing initiatives aimed at reducing its carbon footprint;Collaborative excellence  by championing diversity and innovation within its teams;Data security  by safeguarding the protection of data;Ethical business practices  by building relationships founded on transparency and integrity.Much like its initial assessment  Sidetrade's carbon assessment for 2023 (scopes 1  2 and 3) is the result of a rigorous application of the Bilan Carbone® methodology and covers all its worldwide operations. It heralds a new stage in the process to cut greenhouse gas emissions  strengthening Sidetrade's position as a responsible leader in the technology sector.Both EthiFinance and EcoVadis have recognized the accomplishments of Sidetrade's CSR strategy. First  EthiFinance awarded the Company a Gold medal and a score of 76/100. Second  Sidetrade secured a Silver medal with EcoVadis with an overall score of 68/100. The latter places Sidetrade in the top 25% of companies in sectors across the board. These awards underscore the effectiveness of the Company's CSR strategy  reflecting its commitment as a corporate citizen that is ready to face the challenges of today and tomorrow.Continued growth in 2024  on the back of an unprecedented 2023Over the past few quarters  Sidetrade has consolidated its leadership with ambitions to become the world leader in the fast-growing and rapidly globalizing Order-to-Cash market.Sidetrade looks ahead to the fiscal year 2024 with confidence  driven by an ambitious vision  and has the resources to fulfill its targets.

(""Company"" or ""Cyberoo"")  an innovative SME listed on the EGM (Euronext Growth Milan) market  specialized in cyber security for companies  announces that today the Board of Directors of the company examined and approved the consolidated annual report for the period ended December 31  2023.Fabio Leonardi  CEO of Cyberoo  commented:""The FY23 financial statements confirm the quality of our path  with sound results demonstrating strong growth.Business results were driven by cybersecurity revenues  which grew by 40%  an increase well above the +12% recorded by the market  with an EBITDA margin of 42.2%.The year 2023 was full of initiatives and activities and  despite the complex economic environment  the business generated results that met expectations  affirming the company's strategic choices  and consolidating our leadership in the market. Today  Cyberoo is capable of promptly responding to different cybersecurity needs  guiding  and accompanying businesses on a virtuous path of cyber resilience.Thanks to our technological and service capabilities  Cyberoo also earned recognition as a Gartner Representative Vendor partner in the Market Guide and two other industry reports in 2023.1The inclusion of Cyberoo as the only Italian company in Gartner's ""Market Guide for Managed Detection & Response Services 2023"" and as a Trusted Introducer in the CERT network increasingly recognizes us as a central player in cybersecurity both in Italy and abroad.In 2023  we acquired 100% of Cyber Division  now Cyberoo Docetz  thus making it possible to support the MDR service with unique Incident Response and consulting expertise in the industry. The period also saw the expansion of the i-SOCs  with the opening of a further tier in Warsaw.The investment in Poland has also been satisfying due to the skills contributed as well as for the provision of the service  but also on the commercial front  thanks to the first partnership agreements and the first customer that has entered into a contract.With a growing awareness of our role as a major player in the market  we are preparing for an extremely positive year once again in 2024. Both in 2023 and in this first quarter of 2024  we have in fact continued to invest  with a proactive spirit and the team philosophy that makes us stand out  and to expand our sales and support staff in Italy  with the awareness of having created a unique team in our sector  and in Poland  where the sales force will have the duty of building and consolidating the new network of Polish partners  to build a presence comparable to that present today in the Italian market.Investments are also aimed at launching a new service and extraordinary technological evolutions of existing services  which also use the generative AI developed thanks to the skills of our developers  which we will announce at our Black Club Partner Conference in May in Milano Marittima.Despite the uncertain context and international geopolitical tensions  cybersecurity remains an essential investment for companies  indeed it is today more than ever  as the European Union has issued important directives on the matter.Thanks to what has been done to date  its strong characterization and the investments made  Cyberoo is increasingly recognized in its role as a key player in the cyber security landscape  among the most innovative in the European market  and is ready  increasingly so  to meet market demand  both in Italy and on the European commercial front.We expect our journey to continue along its bright path in the near future.""Main consolidated results as of December 31  2023The business was very positive throughout 2023 and  as in previous years  focused mainly in the second part of the year. Demand for cybersecurity services once again grew significantly compared to previous years  both due to increasing awareness on the part of companies and their emerging ability to build more effective problem-solving strategies. Interest in our MDR solutions has been high on the whole. However  it also had to contend with the uncertain climate that has partially affected the investment capacity of companies  which have also been adversely affected by high interest rates.The opening of the new office in Poland and the associated investments  which partially limited the strong growth in EBITDA  represent an important step in Cyberoo's international expansion. It is a business area distinguished by a high level of cybersecurity awareness and understanding and market size  providing a broad base of potential customers who are aware of the risks they face and the importance of taking effective protective measures. These are two aspects that contribute to the development of the new SOC  which is responsible for promptly responding to cyber threats and ensuring security.During the period  Cyberoo generated cash  but the costs and new investments mentioned above to bring the solutions increasingly up to an enterprise level and open new service lines had an effect on the NFP  although it still posted very positive performance. The main investments concerned the mobile application for customer/SOC interactions and the management of Cypeer alarms  the mobile application for calling Incident Response and the development of new CSI features and the V-NOC project.To maximize investment effectiveness  both specialized resources from within the company and external resources  in any event belonging to the group  were involved in the development of the new service and the evolution of the features of existing solutions. The company also continued to invest significantly to support growth in Southern Italy and  as mentioned above  in Poland. In southern Italy  it expanded and strengthened its team with the goal of boosting local awareness of cybersecurity. The investment in the Polish market aims to meet growing market demand and more generally strengthen Cyberoo's presence in Northern Europe. At the end of 2023  this investment had already generated significant results  such as the first three partnership agreements and the first contract with a Polish client.In May Cyberoo launched its new website  which soon after earned Honorable Mention at the Awwwards (the prestigious international award for web design and user experience) for its creativity and innovation. In addition to being a high-quality showcase for the services offered  the website was updated to include the Black Button  a tool designed to further simplify and speed up contact between Cyberoo and potential clients  who can now request assistance quickly 24/7 in the event of a cyber-attack.In November 2023  the company announced that it had launched CYBShield  an application for mobile devices  designed for Cyberoo clients and aimed at detecting the security interventions and critical issues identified across the entire IT ecosystem.The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of the separate financial statements for the year ended December 31  2023  of Cyberoo S.p.A.

At the same time as the acquisition  the company was renamed Cyberoo Docetz S.r.l. and was organized into various business units  the first of which is specialized in incident response and consulting to help define incident response plans that can handle multiple incidents at the same time.This unit will be joined by Cyber Security & Risk Assessment  which supports the group's network of resellers and businesses that already have Cyberoo MDR  to optimize use of the solution and further reduce any residual risk of cyber-attack  thereby continuing to improve cyber security.Cyberoo Docetz S.r.l. also has a third business unit dedicated to compliance and specialized in consulting in all issues related to the need for ISO 27001 certified protection systems  which is increasingly important in the marketplace  and which can result in important new opportunities for growth  backed by the capabilities Cyberoo has developed in this specific field.On February 14  2023  Gartner Inc.  a multinational leader in IT research and advisory services  included Cyberoo in their Market Guide for Managed Detection & Response Services 2023  the most authoritative international guide on advanced cyber security services  naming Cyberoo as a global representative vendor. In addition to the U.S.companies named  the 2023 Market Guide includes just 12 companies in Europe  including Cyberoo.On April 6  2023  the board of directors of Cyberoo S.p.A. approved submission to the extraordinary shareholders' meeting of the proposal for a 2-to-1 stock split.The operation was approved on April 27 by the extraordinary shareholders' meeting and became effective on May 29  2023.The stock split resulted in a reduction in the nominal value of each share but had no effect on the company's share capital or the characteristics of the shares.The proposed 2-to-1 split was carried out taking into consideration the market value of the stock with an eye on facilitating the trading of the stock itself  fostering greater stock liquidity and thereby rendering it more appealing to a wider range of investors.The approval of the split also resulted in a change in the regulations of the 2019-2023 Cyberoo warrants.Following the establishment at the end of 2022 of the wholly-owned subsidiary Cyberoo PL (Poland) and a short period of recruitment and training activities  Cyberoo inaugurates its new headquarters in Poland on 12 May 2023. This is another major i-SOC (Security Operation Center)  this one based in Warsaw  where Cyberoo conducts second-level i-SOC operations with a large group of cyber specialists engaged in supporting the Group's H24 operational structure.With the start of the Polish operations  Cyberoo's i-SOC has been reinforced and will consist of three tiers. In addition to the so-called level 0 based on innovative artificial intelligence  there will in fact be a 1st level with cyber security analysts in Ternopil in Ukraine  a 2nd tier (the one in Warsaw) with cyber security specialists  and a 3rd with expert cyber security specialists in Italy.The new scalable model will guarantee further improvements in the service offered to customers and will make it possible for Cyberoo to best support the continued growth of customers who are increasingly relying on Cyberoo's MDR (Managed Detection and Response) services.On May 22  2023  Cyberoo approved its first Sustainability Report. The document  which covers fiscal year 2022  was prepared on a voluntary basis based on a selection of the international ""GRI Sustainability Reporting Standards - 2021 "" according to the ""Referenced"" reporting option  and represents another important step for Cyberoo on its Corporate Social Responsibility journey.On May 31  2023  Cyberoo entered into a partnership with BNP Paribas Leasing Solutions for the operating lease and financing of CSI (Cyber Security Intelligence) and Cypeer  Cyberoo's own top advanced cyber security solutions. The option of using operating leases and financing will be especially helpful to small and medium-sized enterprises so they can gain access to medium-term advanced cyber security solutions at a price locked in for three years with monthly or quarterly fee payments. The new solution implemented in collaboration with BNP Paribas Leasing Solutions thus addresses the need for companies to be able to effectively pay for cybersecurity services in installments in order to ensure multiple years of coverage.On June 29  2023  Cyberoo announced that it joined the CERT circuit (Computer Emergency Response Team) of the Trusted Introducer  the industry's leading international reference. The entry into the network of CERTs recognized by Trusted Introducer took place upon completion of a rigorous process during which Cyberoo achieved the goals of the ""SIM3 (Security Incident Management Maturity Model)"" framework dedicated to Listed Organizations. As a CERT  important new opportunities also open up for Cyberoo both withrespect to broadening its visibility to companies in need of cyber security advice and support  but above all collaboration with other international players to exchange information useful for defining best practices aimed at countering new cyber threats to national and international security. The accreditation earned is contingent on meeting specific requirements such as having a 24-hour operation of the Security Operations Center (SOC) and having demonstrable experience in incident management and infrastructure security posture.On August 3  2023  Cyberoo was named ""Example MDR Provider"" in two Gartner studies entitled: Emerging Tech: Security - Leverage Emerging MDR Trends to Grow Your Security Service Revenue and Emerging Tech: Security - Adoption Growth Insights for ManagedDetection and Response. In the first report  the company is named among the MDR service providers that reduce false positives  validate pre-breach security and offer extended coverage to the customer. In the second report  Gartner presents insights and data relating to growth in the adoption of MDR services.On October 16  2023  Cyberoo announced the closure of the Fourth and last Exercise Period of the ""2019-2023 Cyberoo Warrants"" ISIN Code IT0005546103  between October 2  2023  and October 16  2023  inclusive.

CYBShield provides a timely report on all activities carried out by Cyberoo systems on the customer's infrastructure  highlighting any problems  especially of high or critical importance  with extreme speed in real time.On November 29  2023  Cyberoo announced that it had released a new update for ""Global Watcher""  the alert collection and notification system already present in Cypeer and CSI(Cyber Security Intelligence)  two of the proprietary technological solutions aimed at managing corporate cyber security. The new Global Watcher includes significant user interface improvements.On December 7  2023  Cyberoo announced that it has approved the authorization for the purchase and disposal of treasury shares for the following purposes:1) retention for subsequent uses  including: as consideration in extraordinary transactions with other parties  including the exchange or sale of shareholdings to be carried out by exchange  contribution  or other act of disposal and/or use  or their use for bonds convertible into shares of the Company or bonds with warrants or for any warrants;2) to intervene directly or through intermediaries to limit anomalous swings in prices and/or to regularize trading and prices  in the face of any distorting phenomena relating to excess volatility or low trading liquidity  in any case without prejudice to compliance with provisions in force;3) use within the context of future compensation and incentive plans based on financial instruments for directors and employees of the Company  both by granting free call10",neutral,0.03,0.96,0.01,mixed,0.6,0.27,0.13,True,English,"['B.o.D.', 'FY2023 Consolidated Results', 'Cyberoo S', 'March', '03:05', 'Rapid, sharp organic growth', 'Black Club Partner Conference', 'The FY23 financial statements', 'Gartner Representative Vendor partner', 'two other industry reports', 'Cyberoo S.p.A.', 'Euronext Growth Milan', 'complex economic environment', 'international geopolitical tensions', 'effective problem-solving strategies', 'first partnership agreements', 'cyber security landscape', 'unique Incident Response', 'extraordinary technological evolutions', 'different cybersecurity needs', 'market growth values', 'Cyber Security revenues', 'Main consolidated results', 'European commercial front', 'CONFERENCE CALL', 'strong growth', 'cyber resilience', 'Response Services', 'Cyber Division', 'unique team', 'Total revenues', 'first customer', 'first quarter', 'European Union', 'cybersecurity revenues', 'sales revenues', 'European market', 'PRESS RELEASE', 'net income', 'Operating profit', 'March 28th', 'More details', 'last page', 'Reggio Emilia', 'innovative SME', 'annual report', 'Fabio Leonardi', 'sound results', 'strategic choices', 'Managed Detection', 'Trusted Introducer', 'CERT network', 'central player', 'consulting expertise', 'major player', 'proactive spirit', 'team philosophy', 'support staff', 'new network', 'Polish partners', 'existing services', 'generative AI', 'Milano Marittima', 'uncertain context', 'important directives', 'strong characterization', 'key player', 'near future', 'previous years', 'emerging ability', 'MDR solutions', 'uncertain climate', 'cybersecurity services', 'service capabilities', 'MDR service', 'new service', 'Market Guide', 'Italian market', 'virtuous path', 'sales force', 'essential investment', 'bright path', 'investment capacity', 'EBITDA margin', 'DIRECTORS APPROVES', 'second part', 'Cyberoo Docetz', 'Business results', 'growing awareness', 'positive year', 'Italian company', 'market demand', 'production value', 'BOARD', 'NFP', 'cash', 'EGM', 'companies', 'period', 'CEO', 'quality', 'increase', 'initiatives', 'activities', 'expectations', 'leadership', 'accompanying', 'businesses', 'recognition', 'inclusion', 'Italy', 'expansion', 'i-SOCs', 'opening', 'tier', 'Warsaw', 'Poland', 'skills', 'provision', 'contract', 'role', 'fact', 'sector', 'duty', 'presence', 'Investments', 'developers', 'May', 'matter', 'journey', 'December', 'Interest', '4', '2022', '11:30', '2023']",2024-03-27,2024-03-28,marketscreener.com

The adjustment had no cash impact and was intended to reflect recent developments in judicial precedent that led the Group to measure its potential unrealized gain more conservatively.Analysis of business trends by divisionin millions of euros Total Software & Services Flow Data & Marketing BPO Cloud & Support Revenue 2022 555.2 302.0 90.6 106.9 53.0 2.8 2023 616.0 326.6 95.9 114.9 71.5 7.1 Change 10.9% 8.2% 5.9% 7.5% 34.9% 154.0% Recurring operating income(1) 2022 25.7 -4.9 13.1 17.9 3.0 -3.4 2023 31.7 4.2 12.1 15.9 4.0 -4.5 Change 23.4% 185.5% -7.3% -11.3% 33.0% -30.5% Recurring operating margin 2022 4.6% -1.6% 14.4% 16.8% 5.6% -122.5% 2023 5.1% 1.3% 12.6% 13.9% 5.5% -62.9%Software & Services: 2023 revenues rose 8.2%  driven by good performances at Cegedim Santé (+10% over the FY)  HR solutions (+19%)  pharmacy solutions in France (+8%)  and international businesses in the UK and Spain (+7%).Recurring operating income (REBIT) amounted to €4.2 million in 2023  a €9 million increase compared with a €4.9 million loss in 2022.Of the increase  nearly €5 million was attributable to robust sales at Cegedim Santé combined with good hiring management after the company beefed up its sales  operating support  and R&D teams in 2022.International businesses accounted for €3.8 million of the performance  boosted by a strong recovery in Pharmacy solutions in the UK  where restructuring efforts are starting to pay off  and very brisk business at the Activus subsidiary (insurance for expatriate employees).At the remaining software and services entities in France  results were very satisfactory in HR and pharmacy software  offsetting a drop in project-based business in the Insurance segment.Software & Services Change2023 / 2022in millions of euros 2023 2022 Revenues 326.6 302.0 24.6 8.2% Cegedim Santé 76.6 69.6 7.0 10.1% Insurance  HR  Pharmacies  and other services 197.6 183.5 14.1 7.7% International businesses 52.5 48.9 3.5 7.2% Recurring operating income 4.2 -4.9 9.0 185.5% Cegedim Santé -2.9 -7.8 4.9 62.5% Insurance  HR  Pharmacies  and other services 14.7 14.3 0.4 3.0% International businesses -7.6 -11.4 3.8 33.1%Flow: Revenues rose 5.9%  led by process digitalization in electronic data flows  whose French and international businesses grew 7.4%.

Cloud & Support: Revenues rose €4.3 million in 2023  chiefly because all of the Group’s cloud businesses have been moved to this division (some were previously housed in Software & Services).2023 recurring operating income was a €4.5 million loss  €1.1 million higher than the loss in 2022. The increase was notably the result of increased depreciation and amortization expenses borne by cegedim.cloud  which stem from the investments made in the Group’s shared IT infrastructure.HighlightsTo the best of the company’s knowledge  there were no events or changes during 2023 that would materially alter the Group’s financial situation.Acquisition of a majority stake in PhealingOn November 30  2023  Cegedim acquired a majority stake in Phealing  a start-up specializing in secure prescription drug delivery. Phealing’s offer  based around its advanced artificial intelligence engine  caters to a key concern for pharmacies: double checking prescription medication  which means verifying at the time the prescription is filled that the medicine matches the patient’s prescription  physical profile  and illness. Phealing was consolidated in the Group’s accounts starting on December 31  2023  meaning only its balance sheet is reflected.TaxCegedim S.A. has been audited twice since 2018  giving rise to reassessments of the company’s use of tax loss carryforwards disputed by the tax authorities. After consultation with its lawyers and based on the applicable tax law and ample precedent  Cegedim S.A. believes that the tax authorities’ proposed reassessment is unwarranted. As a result  the company has appealed the decision and continues to explore its options for contesting the reassessment.To be in full compliance  Cegedim S.A. has already paid a total of €23 million (incl. €10.9 million in February 2024) to cover reassessments of tax losses used up to 2022. The corresponding entry for these payments is not the taxes line of the income statement  but rather the tax receivables line of the balance sheet  as we expect these sums to be repaid once the dispute has been favorably resolved. Furthermore the Company continues to recognize a deferred tax asset for the remaining disputed tax losses that it believes it will still be able to use  i.e. €7.7 million on the consolidated balance sheet at December 31  2023 (a decrease of €12.3 million year on year after taking into account recent judicial precedent  which led to a more conservative measurement of unrealized potential gains).Cegedim S.A. continues to use the remaining disputed tax loss carryforwards. In the event of an unfavorable ruling  based on the tax losses used until December 31  2023  Cegedim S.A. would have to book a tax loss of €27 million in its P&L  of which it has already paid €23 million  and to cancel €7.7 million in deferred tax assets  a P&L loss which would not entail any cash outflow.In the fourth quarter of 2023  Cegedim S.A. appealed the dispute to the administrative court  an effort which could take several years.Significant transactions and events post December 31  2023Apart from the items cited below  to the best of the Company’s knowledge  there were no events or changes during the period that would materially alter the Group’s financial situation.Acquisition of VisiodentOn February 15  2024  Cegedim Santé acquired Visiodent  a leading French publisher of management software for dental practices and health clinics. Visiodent launched the market’s first 100% SaaS solution  Veasy  at a time when it was significantly expanding its organization. Its users now include the country’s largest nation-wide networks of health clinics  both cooperative and privately owned  as well as several thousand dental surgeons in private practice. Visiodent generated revenue of c.€10 million in 2023 and will begin contributing to Cegedim Group’s consolidation scope on March 1  2024. Post the acquisition  Cegedim is in compliance with all of its covenants and financing contracts.Euris litigationCegedim  jointly with IQVIA (formerly IMS Health)  is being sued by Euris for unfair competition. Cegedim has asked the court to dismiss the case against the Company. On December 17  2018  the Paris Commercial Court granted Cegedim’s request  which IQVIA then appealed. On December 8  2021  the Court of Appeals upheld the judgement in favor of Cegedim. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court  and in a ruling on March 20  2024  the court overturned the Court of Appeals judgement that had exonerated Cegedim. As a result  the case has been sent back to the Paris Court of Appeals with a different set of judges.After consulting its external legal counsel  the Group decided not to set aside any provisions.War in UkraineThe Group does not do business in Russia or Ukraine and has no assets exposed to those countries.OutlookBased on the currently available information  the Group expects 2024 like-for-like revenue(2) growth to be in the range of 5-8% relative to 2023. Recurring operating income should continue to improve  following a similar trajectory as in 2023.These targets are not forecasts and may need to be revised if there is a significant worsening of geopolitical  macroeconomic  or monetary risks.---------------The Audit Committee met on March 25  2024.

Resilient perf…","REGULATED INFORMATION INSIDE INFORMATIONBrussels  March 7  2024 - Viohalco S.A. (Euronext Brussels: VIO  Athens Stock Exchange: VIO)  hereafter ""Viohalco"" or ""the Company""  today announces its consolidated financial results for the year ended 31 December 2023.Resilient performance and lower leverage amidst challenging marketsResponding to demand fluctuations through a flexible business model and diversified portfolioFinancial highlights• Consolidated operating profitability (a-EBITDA) amounted to EUR 537 million compared to EUR 649 million in 2022. The slowdown of global economic growth  combined with inflationary pressures were partially counterbalanced by the continuing green transition trend and related demand;• Consolidated revenue amounted to EUR 6.30 billion vs. EUR 6.99 billion in 2022 due to lower volumes and decline in metal prices;• Consolidated profit before income tax amounted to EUR 91 million compared to EUR 375 million in FY 2022  due to the drop of the metal prices which turned metal results negative and increased finance costs;• Net debt decreased significantly by EUR 184 million to EUR 1 873 million  as a result of effective working capital management  also supported by the decline of metal prices;• Proposed gross* dividend of EUR 0.12 per share.Operational highlights• Significant growth in revenue and profitability for the cables and steel pipes segments  driven by the solid demand  the successful delivery of existing projects and the award of new ones;• Increase in the operating profitability of the copper segment  driven by an improved product mix and the growing sales and profitability of Sofia Med;• The aluminium segment was affected by the global downturn in demand  especially in relation to products in the lithographic sector;• The steel segment was affected by a contraction in the European construction sector demand  increased energy costs and the rise of imports from low-cost countries  partially offset by growth in the Greek construction market;• Continued effort to adapt product portfolio  maximise capacity utilisation and increase operational efficiency across industrial segments;• Positive performance of the real estate division achieved through redevelopment of existing assets with a continued focus on sustainability and active management of existing properties.* The final net dividend can be differentiated  as the Belgian tax authorities impose a withholding tax and tax compliance formalities  depending on the shareholder's tax residence.Commenting on the results  CEO Ippokratis Ioannis Stassinopoulos stated:""In 2023  Viohalco companies demonstrated their ability to swiftly navigate changing market conditions. In an environment of increased interest costs and inflationary pressures  Viohalco managed to post a resilient performance and decrease its debt levels. The cables and steel pipes segments performed very well  since they were able to successfully deliver existing projects  while securing substantial new ones. The copper segment posted a robust operating profitability  outperforming the market. While weak global conditions affected aluminium  the segment maintained its competitive advantage and continued to expand its well-diversified portfolio into faster growing and higher value-added product segments. The steel segment results were affected by subdued demand from the EU construction industry and competition from low-cost imports. Finally  real estate division recorded a positive performance  driven by the increasing demand for high-quality and sustainable buildings in Greece. For the coming years  we are confident that the current downturn in demand will reverse as positive sustainability megatrends take over"".OverviewViohalco's performance throughout 2023 remained resilient  though impacted by weak demand in the aluminium and steel segments  as a consequence of a difficult international market for many products and especially those related to the construction market. This was partially offset by a remarkable performance of the cables and steel pipes segment  as well as of the real estate division and the high operating profitability of the copper segment. The above were supported by the companies' diversified product portfolio and ongoing efforts to streamline operations.The significantly positive performance of the cables and steel pipes segments was a result of increased demand for energy projects and improved competitive positioning in these segments. The awarding of new projects to support the energy transition and meet increasing demand for natural gas  further increased the backlog. The copper segment maintained a high operating profitability driven by the performance of Sofia Med subsidiary. The aluminium segment experienced slower demand across a broad range of aluminium products  amid macroeconomic challenges. However  the segment exhibited resilience in maintaining operating profitability  with concerted efforts directed towards debt reduction. The decrease in revenue was mainly attributable to the performance of the Viohalco subsidiary Bridgnorth Aluminium in the UK  as a result of a contraction in the lithographic business. The performance of the steel segment was overall subdued  affected by the strong downtrend in European steel demand throughout the year  with the exception of the strong demand in Greece and the heavy plates activity  which were respectively positively impacted by a growing construction market and an increasing preference for low carbon footprint solutions. Finally  the real estate division also recorded a positive performance  with Noval Property's active management of existing properties and ability to respond to the demand for high-quality and sustainable buildings proving once again successful. Noval Property remains on track for its Initial Public Offering (IPO) in the Athens Stock Exchange in 2024.Viohalco's financial reporting is split into two divisions  based on their distinct business characteristics and performance metrics:The industrial division  including aluminium  copper  cables  steel pipes  steel  R&D&I and technology segments  and the real estate division comprising of Viohalco's property investments and real estate related entities.The industrial divisionKey highlights€ 6.3 bil. € 519 mil. € 80 mil. € 281 mil. 4.2x Revenue (2022: € 6.96 bil.) a-EBITDA (2022:€ 636 mil.)

The operating profitability (a-EBITDA) of the industrial division amounted to EUR 519 million.Viohalco's industrial division is composed of the following segments: aluminium  copper  cables  steel pipes and steel.• The aluminium segment demonstrated resilience amidst a challenging market with fluctuating demand and macroeconomic dynamics. This result was impacted by the downturn in the lithographic sector for Bridgnorth Aluminium and softened demand across all products. As we move towards a low-carbon future and circular economy becomes increasingly important  demand for sustainable aluminium solutions is expected to remain strong in the long run. Also  within 2023  the segment achieved operational excellence by leveraging its latest investments to help optimise capacity allocation and reshape its product mix distribution.• The copper segment continued to face lower demand as a consequence of interest rate rises and their effect on global economic growth throughout the year. This mainly affected the quantities of copper tubes  copper alloy extruded products and enamelled wire  while growing sales were achieved in copper and copper alloy rolled products and copper extruded products  respectively. The segment's operating profitability was high  driven by the subsidiary Sofia Med   but the profit before taxes was affected by the decline in metal prices. The whole segment continued to align strongly with products and projects related to the global energy transition requiring many different forms of copper and copper alloys  helping to ensure the future growth of the segment.• In the cables segment  the efficient execution of high-profile offshore and onshore energy projects combined with high-capacity utilisation across all production lines supported growth and fostered performance. At the same time  low-voltage and medium-voltage power cables saw strong demand during 2023 and better profitability margins compared to the previous year. This margin growth  combined with an improved product mix alongside timely and efficient project execution  led to a significant improvement in adjusted EBITDA (+39% y-o-y). Along came several new awards  both for interconnections and OWFs  that further advanced the segment's backlog to a new record of EUR 2.5 billion.• For the steel pipes segment  2023 was a strong and landmark year. Revenue reached EUR 580 million and adjusted operating profit (a-EBITDA) more than doubled compared to the year prior. The segment also improved its competitive position as a Tier 1 pipe manufacturer and leader in technologies that enable the energy transition  such as hydrogen transportation through high-pressure steel pipes and pipelines for Carbon Capture & Storage (CCS) projects  benefiting from a wide array of strategic initiatives undertaken during previous years. Demand for natural gas and the necessity to continue towards the new energy paradigm  while guaranteeing energy security  led to a series of high-margin new contracts and a strong order backlog of approximately EUR 650 million by the end of the year.• In 2023  the steel segment's performance was subdued  mainly as a consequence of the sharp downward trend in the European steel market throughout the year. The segment maintained its leading market position in the growing Greek construction market. However  the deteriorating European construction sector  increased energy costs and elevatedimports of steel products from low-cost countries  negatively affected the overall performance. As a result  sales of reinforcing steel  wire rods and merchant bars reduced significantly. This was partially offset by increased demand for hot rolled plates from the Baltic and North European countries  where the low carbon footprint of Stomana Industry's quarto plates provided a competitive advantage. Sales of special steels (SBQ) saw a reduction in volume  attributable to the European mechanical engineering sector slow-down. Price spreads also significantly declined across all the product ranges. Notwithstanding the impact of macro challenges and high energy prices  the steel segment's scrap supply proved resilient and didn't impact product delivery and service levels.The real estate divisionKey highlights€ 38 mil. €18 mil. 471 K sqm 98.1 % € 27 mil.

This was achieved despite a challenging macro environment characterised by increases in energy and product prices  as well as high interest rates and prevailing geopolitical turbulence in the region. This performance stems from Noval Property's strengthened portfolio as a result of the continuous active management of existing properties  the increasing demand for high-quality and sustainable buildings in Greece and the implementation of Noval Property's captive development programme  comprising of the commencement and advancement of preliminary works and construction on several properties. In October 2023  Noval Property entered into a EUR 10.5 million convertible bond loan with EBRD  in view of the company's Initial Public Offering (IPO) listing on the Athens Stock Exchange  expected to take place in 2024.It should be noted that Viohalco applies the historical cost in investment property  while certain real estate division subsidiaries (such as Noval Property) follow the fair value model. Noval Property 2023 earnings before taxes  based on the fair value model  amounted to profits of EUR 67.5 million (Historical cost earnings before tax amounted to EUR 13 million)  while GAV as of 31.12.2023 (including long-term leases) amounted to EUR 582.6 million and NAV stood at EUR 427.4 million.Finally  sustainability remains a key priority for all Viohalco subsidiaries  as the companies successfully progressed various initiatives in line with the overarching sustainability strategy. Climate change  circular economy and occupational health and safety remained at the forefront of the efforts  as significant human and financial resources were invested to continuingly improving in those areas. Sustainability is a key requirement for Viohalco companies' customers  especially in the cables and aluminium segment  where inquiries about the sustainability attributes of the products  sustainability certifications and long-term commitment to decarbonisation efforts from Viohalco subsidiaries are requested on a regular basis. In addition to this  during 2023  Viohalco completed the evaluation of the most important climate-related risks and opportunities of the subsidiaries and published its first inaugural TCFD Report.OutlookAmidst ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty driving demand fluctuations  Viohalco's companies' diversified portfolio  sustained competitive advantages  streamlined processes and optimised capacity utilisation  coupled with long-term projections for sustainable products' demand  bode well for the future.While the aluminium and steel segments faced revenue setbacks in FY 2023 due to demand fluctuations  the rising demand for innovative and sustainable packaging solutions  energy-efficient infrastructure and shifts in the automotive industry  combinedwith ongoing efforts to enhance operational efficiency  will continue to bolster Viohalco companies' competitiveness in these areas.At the same time  the cables  copper and steel pipes segments are expected to keep gaining momentum  fueled by the inevitable shift toward electrification  the wide deployment of investments in RES and the need for grid expansions  as well as increasing requirements for hydrogen and Carbon Capture & Storage (CCS).On the real estate front  Noval Property's diversified portfolio and planned developments  together with its successful active management business model provides further strength to its overall positioning.For further information  please contact:Sofia Zairi  Chief Investor Relations Officer Tel: +30 210 6861111Email:ir@viohalco.com _______A conference call to discuss these results will be held on Friday  March 8th 2024 at 13:00 GMT / 15:00 EET.To participate in the teleconference  please dial in approximately 5 minutes before the start of the call and use one of the following telephone numbers:• Greek participants: +30 213 009 6000 or +30 210 94 60 800• UK participants: +44 (0) 800 368 1063• UK & International: +44 (0) 203 059 5872• USA participants: +1 516 447 5632Financial overviewConsolidated financial key figuresAmounts in EUR thousands 2023 2022 *Represented Revenue 6 301 957 6 985 735 Gross profit* 578 867 781 736 EBITDA 436 033 646 363 a-EBITDA 537 447 648 897 EBIT 290 404 497 250 a-EBIT 391 818 499 783 Net finance cost -187 796 -121 320 Profit before tax 91 324 374 564 Profit for the period 66 516 302 389 Profit attributable to owners 48 233 266 133 *Please refer to Appendix A.In 2023  Viohalco's consolidated revenue decreased to EUR 6.30 billion (2022: EUR 6.99 billion). This was mainly due to the decrease in metal prices and the reduced volumes sold compared to 2022.Consolidated a-EBITDA decreased at EUR 537 million (2022: EUR 649 million)  as a result of the decrease in volumes.Net finance cost increased to EUR 188 million (2022: EUR 121 million)  as a consequence of higher interest rates.Consolidated profit before income tax for the period amounted to EUR 91 million  compared to EUR 375 million in 2022.Consolidated net profit after income tax and minority interests amounted to EUR 48 million (2022: EUR 266 million); with earnings per share amounted at EUR 0.19 (2022: EUR 1.03).Amounts in EUR thousands 31.12.2023 31.12.2022 Fixed and intangible assets 2 805 429 2 625 715 Other non-current assets 116 789 100 709 Non-current assets 2 922 219 2 726 424 Inventory 1 610 467 1 914 098 Trade and other receivables (incl. contract assets) 955 613 874 921 Cash and cash equivalents 395 015 412 644 Other current assets 36 397 102 109 Current assets 2 997 491 3 303 772 Total assets 5 919 710 6 030 196 Equity 1 959 371 1 955 895 Loans and borrowings 1 442 138 1 471 299 Other non-current liabilities 217 304 219 685 Non-current liabilities 1 659 442 1 690 985 Loans and borrowings 779 297 958 166 Trade and other payables (incl. contract liabilities) 1 463 473 1 304 828 Other current liabilities 58 127 120 322 Current liabilities 2 300 897 2 383 316 Total equity and liabilities 5 919 710 6 030 196Capital expenditure for the period amounted to EUR 308 million (2022: EUR 357 million)  is mainly due to the following investments:▪ New production equipment in the context of ElvalHalcor's aluminum segment investment programme  aiming at increasing production capacity increase and improving the product portfolio mix;▪ Capacity increase of copper segment's subsidiary  Sofia Med;▪ Capacity increase of the offshore cables plant in Corinth and selective investments in onshore cables plants in the area of Thiva  Greece;▪ Capacity improvements at the steel pipes segment in the Thisvi plant;▪ Machinery improvements and IT investments at the steel segment subsidiaries;▪ Development of the existing portfolio and new property development in the real estate division.The decrease in working capital by 26% was mainly driven by the drop in metal prices  coupled with the organic reduction in the cash-to-cash cycle.Net debt decreased to EUR 1 873 million (31 December 2022: EUR 2 057 million)  due to Viohalco's positive free cash flow during the year.Segmental performanceAmounts in EUR million Revenue EBITDA a-EBITDA EBIT EBT Segments 2023 2022 2023 2022 2023 2022 2023 2022 2023 2022 1 887 2 313 95 271 153 223 35 211 -7 179 1 721 1 811 91 81 107 75 72 63 36 40 991 895 140 107 152 110 120 89 73 64 580 457 64 25 66 25 54 16 25 8 1 014 1 392 22 144 42 196 -5 113 -41 88 69 88 - 6 -1 7 -4 1 -6 -1 6 264 6 955 411 634 519 636 272 494 80 377 38 30 25 13 18 13 18 3 11 -2 6 302 6 986 436 646 537 649 290 497 91 375 IndustrialDivisionAluminiumCopperCablesSteel pipesSteelOther activitiesTotalReal EstateDivision* Consolidated* Apart from Noval Property  the real estate division of Viohalco includes other entities that relate to real estate operations. It should be noted that Viohalco applies the historical cost model in investment property  while certain real estate division subsidiaries (such as Noval Property) follow the fair value model. NovalProperty 2023 earnings before taxes  based on fair value model  amounted to profits of EUR 67.5 million.Performance review by divisionThe industrial divisionAluminiumIn 2023  the revenue of the aluminium segment amounted to EUR 1 887 million (2022: 2 313)  with a loss before tax for the period of EUR 7 million (2022: profit before tax at EUR 179 million)  mostly attributable to a negative performance of the aluminium subsidiary Bridgnorth Aluminium in the UK and declining metal prices.Throughout the year  geopolitical issues  high inflation and elevated interest rates  affected global demand across a broad range of aluminium products offered by ElvalHalcor's aluminium segment  with total sales volume decreasing by 2% (excluding Etem Group  sales tonnage remained flat compared to 2022). Moreover  the lower aluminium LME prices during 2023 against the historical high of 2022  resulted to significant accounting metal losses  against metal profits of EUR 50 million in 2022. These metal losses  along with higher interest expenses affected profitability.The numerous interest rate increases during the year saw the prioritisation of debt reduction. Through lower capital expenditure  coming after the completion of the previous investment plan and better management of working capital  the segment was able to successfully reduce net debt to EUR 613 vs. EUR 746 million as at December 31st  2022.Increasing consumer preference toward high recycled content in packaging solutions  energy-efficient infrastructure and the adoption of lightweight and electric vehicles will continue to drive the demand for aluminium solutions. ElvalHalcor's aluminium segment is well-diversified across different geographic regions and product categories and it aims to expand further into faster-growing product segments and value-added applications. It is also committed to establishing strong collaborations for future growth and competitive strength  while contributing to a sustainable aluminium value-chain.During 2023  ElvalHalcor published its first inaugural Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) Report  in which the aluminium segment companies identified and assessed their most important climate-related risks and opportunities.2023 was a challenging year for Bridgnorth Aluminium. The company undertook a comprehensive restructuring program and experienced ongoing subdued demand through 2023 for all products. Bridgnorth Aluminium continues to further optimise and improve Health & Safety  Technology  Quality and Operational Performance across the entire business to ensure the company is ready to match current and future customer demand and to also reach potential new customers in the global EV market and others.In 2023  Etem Gestamp has been balancing the expansion of existing facilities and installation of machinery to cope with new automotive projects and the adverse market conditions impacting the industrial side of the business. Throughout the period  the output of the industrial aluminium profiles was impacted by consistent declines in sales prices and profit margins  combined with high market competition  which also supressed targeted volumes. On the other hand  automotive sales outperformed forecasts  mostly benefited from a stable and increasing demand trend which in turn supported both cash flow and profitability  while enabling the transformation of the businesses' client portfolio in favour of automotive. While the electric vehicle industry has seen some delays in the launching of new models and uncertainty  the company's product portfolio  which is well balanced between electric and combustion engine cars  along with its universal machinery configuration  remains well positioned to navigate the automotive market developments in 2024.10",neutral,0.01,0.98,0.01,mixed,0.38,0.3,0.32,True,English,"['Viohalco S A', 'Financial results', 'March', 'CEO Ippokratis Ioannis Stassinopoulos', 'continuing green transition trend', 'effective working capital management', 'higher value-added product segments', 'European construction sector demand', 'Athens Stock Exchange', 'flexible business model', 'real estate division', 'EU construction industry', 'Greek construction market', 'Belgian tax authorities', 'tax compliance formalities', 'changing market conditions', 'difficult international market', 'steel pipes segments', 'weak global conditions', 'final net dividend', 'Sofia Med subsidiary', 'robust operating profitability', 'high operating profitability', 'Viohalco S.A.', 'global economic growth', 'Consolidated operating profitability', 'positive sustainability megatrends', 'diversified product portfolio', 'steel segment results', 'steel segments', 'lithographic sector', 'active management', 'energy transition', 'product mix', 'global downturn', 'industrial segments', 'diversified portfolio', 'Net debt', 'gross* dividend', 'income tax', 'withholding tax', 'tax residence', 'Consolidated profit', 'weak demand', 'REGULATED INFORMATION', 'INSIDE INFORMATION', 'financial results', 'lower leverage', 'challenging markets', 'Financial highlights', 'inflationary pressures', 'lower volumes', 'metal prices', 'metal results', 'finance costs', 'Operational highlights', 'Significant growth', 'successful delivery', 'existing projects', 'copper segment', 'growing sales', 'energy costs', 'low-cost countries', 'Continued effort', 'capacity utilisation', 'operational efficiency', 'existing assets', 'continued focus', 'existing properties', 'interest costs', 'debt levels', 'competitive advantage', 'faster growing', 'sustainable buildings', 'coming years', 'current downturn', 'ongoing efforts', 'energy projects', 'competitive positioning', 'natural gas', 'broad range', 'macroeconomic challenges', 'concerted efforts', 'debt reduction', 'Positive performance', 'demand fluctuations', 'related demand', 'solid demand', 'increasing demand', 'slower demand', 'Resilient performance', 'Consolidated revenue', 'substantial new', 'many products', 'remarkable performance', 'new projects', 'Viohalco subs', 'aluminium segment', 'Euronext Brussels', 'low-cost imports', 'aluminium products', 'Viohalco companies', 'Company', 'EBITDA', 'slowdown', 'decline', 'FY', 'drop', 'share', 'cables', 'award', 'Increase', 'relation', 'contraction', 'rise', 'redevelopment', 'environment', 'subdued', 'competition', 'high-quality', 'Greece', 'Overview', 'consequence', 'operations', 'backlog', 'resilience', 'decrease']",2024-03-27,2024-03-28,marketscreener.com

It was particularly buoyed by services managed on behalf of health and personal protection insurers  which jumped more than 55.3% owing to the start of the new contract with Allianz on April 1  2023. Revenues from services management on behalf of HR departments rose 3.4%. The division’s recurring operating income climbed 33%  bolstered mainly by outsourcing for HR departments  which is riding a wave of management process automation. Sales to insurers posted positive recurring operating income  up slightly  despite the costs of launching the Allianz contract. Cloud & Support: Revenues rose €4.3 million in 2023  chiefly because all of the Group’s cloud businesses have been moved to this division (some were previously housed in Software & Services).2023 recurring operating income was a €4.5 million loss  €1.1 million higher than the loss in 2022. The increase was notably the result of increased depreciation and amortization expenses borne by cegedim.cloud  which stem from the investments made in the Group’s shared IT infrastructure.HighlightsTo the best of the company’s knowledge  there were no events or changes during 2023 that would materially alter the Group’s financial situation.Acquisition of a majority stake in PhealingOn November 30  2023  Cegedim acquired a majority stake in Phealing  a start-up specializing in secure prescription drug delivery. Phealing’s offer  based around its advanced artificial intelligence engine  caters to a key concern for pharmacies: double checking prescription medication  which means verifying at the time the prescription is filled that the medicine matches the patient’s prescription  physical profile  and illness. Phealing was consolidated in the Group’s accounts starting on December 31  2023  meaning only its balance sheet is reflected.TaxCegedim S.A. has been audited twice since 2018  giving rise to reassessments of the company’s use of tax loss carryforwards disputed by the tax authorities. After consultation with its lawyers and based on the applicable tax law and ample precedent  Cegedim S.A. believes that the tax authorities’ proposed reassessment is unwarranted. As a result  the company has appealed the decision and continues to explore its options for contesting the reassessment.To be in full compliance  Cegedim S.A. has already paid a total of €23 million (incl. €10.9 million in February 2024) to cover reassessments of tax losses used up to 2022. The corresponding entry for these payments is not the taxes line of the income statement  but rather the tax receivables line of the balance sheet  as we expect these sums to be repaid once the dispute has been favorably resolved. Furthermore the Company continues to recognize a deferred tax asset for the remaining disputed tax losses that it believes it will still be able to use  i.e. €7.7 million on the consolidated balance sheet at December 31  2023 (a decrease of €12.3 million year on year after taking into account recent judicial precedent  which led to a more conservative measurement of unrealized potential gains).Cegedim S.A. continues to use the remaining disputed tax loss carryforwards. In the event of an unfavorable ruling  based on the tax losses used until December 31  2023  Cegedim S.A. would have to book a tax loss of €27 million in its P&L  of which it has already paid €23 million  and to cancel €7.7 million in deferred tax assets  a P&L loss which would not entail any cash outflow.In the fourth quarter of 2023  Cegedim S.A. appealed the dispute to the administrative court  an effort which could take several years.Significant transactions and events post December 31  2023Apart from the items cited below  to the best of the Company’s knowledge  there were no events or changes during the period that would materially alter the Group’s financial situation.Acquisition of VisiodentOn February 15  2024  Cegedim Santé acquired Visiodent  a leading French publisher of management software for dental practices and health clinics. Visiodent launched the market’s first 100% SaaS solution  Veasy  at a time when it was significantly expanding its organization. Its users now include the country’s largest nation-wide networks of health clinics  both cooperative and privately owned  as well as several thousand dental surgeons in private practice. Visiodent generated revenue of c.€10 million in 2023 and will begin contributing to Cegedim Group’s consolidation scope on March 1  2024. Post the acquisition  Cegedim is in compliance with all of its covenants and financing contracts.Euris litigationCegedim  jointly with IQVIA (formerly IMS Health)  is being sued by Euris for unfair competition. Cegedim has asked the court to dismiss the case against the Company. On December 17  2018  the Paris Commercial Court granted Cegedim’s request  which IQVIA then appealed. On December 8  2021  the Court of Appeals upheld the judgement in favor of Cegedim. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court  and in a ruling on March 20  2024  the court overturned the Court of Appeals judgement that had exonerated Cegedim. As a result  the case has been sent back to the Paris Court of Appeals with a different set of judges.After consulting its external legal counsel  the Group decided not to set aside any provisions.War in UkraineThe Group does not do business in Russia or Ukraine and has no assets exposed to those countries.OutlookBased on the currently available information  the Group expects 2024 like-for-like revenue(2) growth to be in the range of 5-8% relative to 2023. Recurring operating income should continue to improve  following a similar trajectory as in 2023.These targets are not forecasts and may need to be revised if there is a significant worsening of geopolitical  macroeconomic  or monetary risks.---------------The Audit Committee met on March 25  2024.

We have been able to drive strong profitability growth and positive cash flow  even with the Group's strategic R&D investments and the conclusion of significant M&A transactions (acquisition of Memory and Belive). 2023 also marks a turning point as we will propose a €0.30 per share dividend at the next Annual General Meeting. We are very pleased to be able to begin this practice and hope to maintain it into the future. 2023 was also a year of notable progress on our ESG agenda. We continued to pursue efforts to reduce our carbon intensity and have formalized the objectives of our path to reducing carbon emissions by 2030  in alignment with the Paris Agreement. Our R&D strategy continues to focus on the objectives of our Roadmap for Positive Commerce  with solutions that help our customers to develop local and low-carbon e-commerce  reduce food waste  encourage responsible consumption  and contribute to more value-added local jobs. The true strength of our Group resides in our almost 900 employees who represent 40 nationalities; convinced  as we are  that motivation is the engine of performance  we have continued to foster a culture of motivating  exciting  and fulfilling work. In 2023 our Board of Directors made progress on its task of adapting the Group's governance to reflect the strong international growth of the past few years and recent changes in our shareholder base. With our order book at an all-time high  VusionGroup benefits from a strong degree of visibility and confidence in its objective of attaining the milestone of €1 billion in 2024 revenue .”___________________________________Strong growth in 2023 in line with guidanceThe Group's 2023 full year sales reached €802.0m and €805.6m in adjusted terms  for +30% growth versus 2022.In EMEA  top line increased almost +32% versus the previous year to €642m and accounted for close to 80% of the Group's total annual sales.Revenue in the Americas and Asia-Pacific (Rest of World) totaled €160m and €163m in adjusted terms for growth of almost +22% compared to 2022. This growth is expected to accelerate sharply in 2024  fueled by sales in North America where the Group made a decisive breakthrough when it signed a contract with Walmart. Several other significant contracts have also been signed.Global order entries grew +39% in 2023 to €950m.VAS2 GrowthOne of the important axes of the Vusion'27 strategic plan lies in the expansion of our non-ESL solutions towards Cloud/SAAS  Data  Computer Vision  AI and Retail Media solutions  to fully digitalize stores and enable retailers and their suppliers to better take advantage of this digitization in terms of operational performance and customer experience. In this regard  2023 was an important build-out year in this area  notably with the acquisition of Memory and Belive. The integration and collaboration of these new entities with Captana  Markethub and Engage allows us to work on very innovative and high value-added solutions that will be launched in 2024. In parallel  the Group has started recruiting teams internationally for the expansion of these solutions  notably in the United States.Our installed base of Cloud-connected ESLs grew rapidly in 2023 to reach more than 17 000 stores and 82m ESLs. This momentum is expected to continue its accelerated course.Sales of software  services  and non-ESL solutions (VAS) reached €109m in 2023  a year-over-year increase of +17%. Within VAS revenue [2]  recurring services[3] -- which represent 39% of VAS sales or €42m -- are growing at a faster rate than total VAS revenue. Conversely  non-recurring services[4] decreased slightly to €67m in 2023 within a challenging macroeconomic environment in which retailers have slowed or delayed some of their projects  often due to internal resource constraints.A similar momentum is expected to continue for the VAS top-line in 2024  with non-recurring revenue impacted by ongoing macroeconomic-related pressure  and continued growth in recurring revenue.Ongoing profitability improvement driven by growth in the variable cost marginProfit and Loss Statement *In € millions 2023 IFRS 15 Adjustment1 2023Adjusted1 2022 ChangeIFRS Change Adjusted Revenue 802.0 (3.7) 805.6 620.9 +29% +30% Variable cost margin% of revenue 201.9 (3.7) 205.5 131.4 +54% +56% 25.2% 25.5% 21.2% +4.0 pts +4.3 pts Operating expense% of revenue (99.5) (99.5) (72.8) +37% +37% 12.4% 12.4% 11.7% +0.6 pt +0.6 pt EBITDA% of revenue 102.3 (3.7) 106.0 58.6 +75% +81% 12.8% 13.2% 9.4% +3.4 pts +3.7 pts Depreciation and amortization expense (36.5) (36.5) (27.2) +34% +34% Non-recurring or non-cash items (14.3) (14.3) 0.3 N/A N/A EBIT% of revenue 51.5 (3.7) 55.1 31.7 +62% +74% 6.4% 6.8% 5.1% +1.3 pt +1.7 pt Net Financial Income (Expense) 43.0 48.6 (5.6) (6.1) N/A -7% Tax (14.9) (14.9) (7.1) +111% +111% Net income% of revenue 79.69.9% 44.9 34.64.3% 18.63.0% +328%6.9 pts +87%1.3 ptIn 2022 the Group saw its profitability improve significantly  with EBITDA increasing to €58.6m and EBITDA margin growing to almost 9.4%  an expansion of almost 2 points compared to 2021. This trend continued into 2023 with an EBTDA margin that grew almost 3.4 points compared to 2022  for an increase of more than 5 points in two years. For the first time in several years  and in alignment with what was announced at the Capital Markets Day in November 2022  the profitability growth delivered in 2023 comes mainly from improvement in the variable cost margin (VCM).The VCM grew to €201.9m in 2023  for a margin rate of 25.2% of revenue. Adjusted VCM1 reached €205.5m in 2023  compared to €131.4m in 2022  for a +56% increase  and a VCM margin rate of 25.5% of revenue in 2023 compared to 21.2% for the previous year  marking a 4.3-point improvement during the year.The improvement in the VCM rate was driven mainly by three factors:More favorable purchase prices for components  following the strong price increase at the end of the COVID pandemic  with 2022 showing the highest costs since 2020.A more favorable EUR/USD exchange rate for the Group in 2023 compared to 2022.A more favorable mix within VAS  with stronger growth of high-margin recurring services (cloud  data  AI)  compared to non-recurring services  which did not grow between 2022 et 2023.Operating expense was €99.5m in 2023 compared to €72.9m the previous year and represented 12.4% of 2023 revenue versus 11.7% of revenue in 2022. This increase is due primarily to the acquisition of Belive and Memory  whose business models – as is typical of software companies – comprise higher operating expenses  at least in the early years of the business  alongside higher operating margins. The Group does not anticipate a decrease in the operating expense ratio in 2024. Indeed  significant headcount increases are taking place at the central corporate level  and in the United States (where average salaries are higher than in other VusionGroup geographies) to support strong growth in the American market.EBITDA  or operating income before depreciation  amortization expense and other non-recurring and non-cash items  was €102.3m in 2023 and €106.0m on an adjusted basis1  for +81% growth versus €58.6m in 2022.Adjusted EBITDA margin1 was more than 13% of revenue in 2023  compared to 9.4% of revenue in 2022  a +3.7-point improvement  driven mainly by the higher VCM.Depreciation and amortization expense increased +34% in 2023  for a total of €36.5m (compared to €27.2m in 2022). This increase is directly tied to VusionGroup's significant capital expenditure in R&D and innovation  and particularly to the start of amortization of the development expense tied to the new EdgeSense solution.Non-cash and non-recurring items represented an expense of €14.3m in 2023  compared to income of €0.3m in 2022  and were comprised primarily of a non-cash IFRS 2 expense of €12.4m related to the performance shares granted to the Group's employees between 2021 and year-end 2023. It also includes legal fees related to M&A and the refinancing which took place in December 2023. The €0.3m income reported in 2022 includes a €7.6m IFRS2 expense and a €6.7m gain related to the Group's sale of its stake in the Chinese joint venture.Net Financial Income (Expense)Net financial income was €43.0m in 2023. As was the case in the financial statements of H1 2023  IFRS net financial income or expense includes the impact of the change in fair value of the stock warrants granted  under specific conditions  to Walmart. The initial fair value of the stock warrants  at the time they were granted in early June 2023  was €163m. Factoring in the change in VusionGroup's share price  the warrants were valued at €115m on December 31  2023. The difference between these two valuations  or +€48.6m  is accounted for in net financial income/expense.Other than this IFRS restatement  which has no cash impact  net financial expense was -€5.6m  compared to -€6.1m in 2022  or a decrease of -7%  accounted for by -€11.4m in financial expense  and the balance resulting from net foreign exchange rate gains totaling +€5.8m.Pre-tax income totaled €94.5m in 2023  compared €25.6m in 2022. This level of profit led to a tax expense of -€14.9m in 2023 compared to a tax expense of -€7.1m in 2022.Net incomeVusionGroup's 2023 net income reached €79.6m. Adjusted to exclude the non-cash IFRS charges related to the Walmart contract  2023 adjusted net income1 totaled €34.6m  for +87% growth compared to the €18.6m net income reported in 2022.Capital ExpenditureR&D expenditure accounted for most of VusionGroup's capital expenditure in 2023. During the year  the Group launched EdgeSense  a system that is set to revolutionize ESLs and the digitalization of shelves. The Group also launched VusionOX  the new secure IoT cloud platform  based on the Bluetooth protocol. These major innovations  developed over several years  were critical to signing the Walmart contract. The powerful functionalities they provide retailers  consumers  and suppliers will profoundly change the market in the years to come.The other significant capital expenditure is accounted for by the industrial production lines for the new EdgeSense range of products. However  these lines are pre-financed by the first large customer to roll out this innovation  so VusionGroup's cash position is not impacted by this investment.Capital expenditure in €m (*) H1 2023 H2 2023 FY 2023 FY 2022 R&D and IT expenditure 44.9 19.3 64.2 44.2 Of which: EdgeSense (HW) 30.8 6.3 37.2 22.4 Industrial investments 1.6 17.6 19.1 4.4 Of which: EdgeSense production lines  financed by customers 16.5 16.5 0.0 Other 1.6 2.5 4.1 2.5 TOTAL CAPEX 48.0 39.5 87.5 51.1 EdgeSense production lines financed by Walmart (16.5) (16.5) Cash Capex 48.0 23.0 71.0 51.1 Cash Capex / Revenue 12.6% 5.4% 8.8% 8.2%(*) Audit procedures in progressIn 2023 the Group's capital expenditure totaled €87.5m before pre-financing  €71.0m in Cash Capex (net of customer pre-financing; please see comment below) compared to €51.1m the previous year.In H2 2023 VusionGroup invested in production lines located at the premises of and operated by its assembly partners  in order to produce the EdgeSense range of products. This investment  which is expected to continue over the coming years  aims to guarantee sufficient levels of production capacity to ensure the large volumes required by the first large customer to roll out the new solution. This customer has agreed to pre-finance the entire investment  as their volume needs will absorb a large portion of the production capacity. Additionally  if these production lines were used to manufacture products for other customers  VusionGroup would pay a fee to the customer who pre-financed these industrial assets. The first of these pre-financed lines is expected to be operational in H2 2024.In its disclosure  the Group makes a distinction between Total Capex and the expenditures that have a cash impact – Cash Capex – which is the capital expenditure net of what has been pre-financed by customers.Cash Capex was temporarily higher in H2 2022 and H1 2023 when the Group finalized and industrialized the new EdgeSense solution. The EdgeSense project  in particular  accounts for the Cash Capex/Revenue ratio increase to over 8% in 2022 and 2023. With the finalization of EdgeSense  the H2 2023 Cash Capex / Revenue ratio has decreased to approximately 5%  in line with the Group's guidance for a ratio in a range of 5% to 7% through 2027.Strong net cash generationThe Group ended 2023 with a positive net cash position of +€27.3m  for an improvement of €67.7m compared to the net debt position of -€40.5m at year-end 2022.Consolidated Cash Flow Statement (€m) (*) FY 2023 FY 2022 Adjusted EBITDAImpact of IFRS 16 106.0(3.8) 58.6(2.3) Capex (87.5) (51.3) Change in Working Capital 155.9 (27.7) Tax (13.2) (2.0) Free Cash flow 157.4 (24.7) Net Financial Expense (6.0) (5.2) Share buy-back (5.0) Financial Investments (inc.

This achievement is particularly noteworthy in light of:The financing needs for strong growth;Strategic R&D investment  and external growth (acquisition of Belive and Memory) in H1 2023;A negative seasonality impact on working capital in H2 2023 (with Q4 2023 generating much higher revenue than Q3 2023).Share repurchases totaling €5m.These expenditures have been more than fully offset by the strong EBITDA and working capital improvements.In 2023  the Group continued to improve all items of operational working capital thanks to rigorous management and efficient information systems  with inventories going from 100 to 51 days  receivables from 60 to 45 days  and supplier payables from 82 to 60 days. In total  operational working capital improved from 79 to 45 days (121.6 M€ or 15% of turnover).The increase in customer down-payments also strongly contributed to the improvement of total working capital. This is also an element inherently linked to the improvement of our strategic positioning and our business model. The Group is indeed better able today to negotiate satisfactory contractual terms that allow our company to manage large contracts without financing risks or weakening our balance sheet. We develop with our major customers real partnerships of value creation in the long term that are balanced and healthy.VusionGroup expects to continue to generate positive cash flow in 2024.2024 Outlook and TargetsWith an order book at an all-time high  VusionGroup has a strong level of visibility and confidence in its objective of attaining the milestone of €1 billion in 2024 revenue.The anticipated growth will be weighted toward H2 2024 due to the planned launch of new EdgeSense production lines in Q2 2024 to fulfill the Walmart contract. VusionGroup expects to generate revenue of €175 -180m in Q1 and €420 - 440m in H1 2024 (for growth of +10-15%) followed by a record H2 2024 with sales revenue of €580 – 600m (+30-40%).Regarding the geographic distribution of annual sales  VusionGroup targets 50-60% of revenue to be generated in EMEA and 40-50% in the rest of the world  primarily the United States  which in 2024 is set to become the Group's largest market  ahead of Germany. In light of the final stages of a large roll-out in Europe  sales in EMEA will decrease temporarily compared to the record levels reported in 2023 and are expected to begin to grow again in 2025 as a result of large contracts recently signed in the region. Sales in the United States are expected to accelerate strongly  resulting in triple-digit growth.Total VAS revenue is anticipated to reach €120–140m  a target which takes into account the ongoing difficult macroeconomic environment for commerce in Europe  which will most likely weigh on the capex allocated by retailers to new and innovative projects  an in particular on non-recurring VAS in H1 which are expected to decrease. However  the recurring VAS objective is to continue to grow strongly compared to 2023  and to reach a year-end revenue target of €60m+. It should be noted that 2024 forecast only include a small part of the recurring revenues tied to the large roll-outs planned during the year  which will ramp-up in parallel of stores installations and will therefore be only visible in 2025. On the basis of planned roll-outs  the recurring VAS revenue is forecast to more than double in 2025.VusionGroup expects to generate robust order growth during 2024.VusionGroup also expects profitability improvement to continue  with adjusted EBITDA margin1 growing by 50 to 100 bps in 2024 and continued positive cash flow for the year.Given this positive outlook and the successful refinancing carried out at year-end 2023  the Group remains confident in its ability to secure sufficient financing through the life of its Vusion '27 strategic plan.VusionGroup strengthens its governanceTo reflect the strong international growth VusionGroup experienced in the past years  the evolution of its capital structure over the last 18 months  and as a continuation of the changes put in place at year-end 2022  the Board of Directors of the Group will propose two new independent non-executive directors (as defined by the Afep-Medef Code) to the next Annual General meeting of shareholders  scheduled to be held on June 19th.Peter Brabeck-Letmathe has been named Vice-Chairman of the Board of Directors and Lead Independent Director. Mr. Brabeck-Letmathe will also serve as Chairman of the new Strategy and ESG Committee. The naming of at least two new independent board members will be proposed at the next Annual General Meeting  which will increase the proportion of independent directors to 60% of the Board. One of those directors will be named by Bpifrance  which currently holds 8.21% of VusionGroup's shares. The second new director is expected to reflect Vusion's increased presence and growth in the United States.The Group also announces that it has promoted two members of the executive committee to the position of Deputy CEO in order to support the Chairman and CEO in the management and transformation of the Group for the execution of the Vusion ‘27 strategic 5-year plan:In the context of strong growth acceleration in the United States in the coming years  Philippe Bottine has been named Deputy CEO in charge of the Americas region  product management  and the global supply chain.With the aim of strengthening central corporate functions  Thierry Lemaitre has been named Deputy CEO in charge of Finance  Legal  Information Systems  Internal Control  Risk Management  and Security.These two internal promotions will allow the Chairman and CEO of the Group to spend more time on the strategic transformation of the Group.Philippe Bottine  44 years old  is an engineer who began his career in venture capital  based in California. He joined VusionGroup in 2009 and was responsible for R&D (where he contributed to several innovations and acquisitions) and the Group's industrial supply chain. Since relocating to the United States in 2016  Philippe has built VusionGroup's American success story over the course of a few years.Thierry Lemaitre  56 years old  was previously Chief Financial Officer at Wanadoo  Numéricable  and SFR. He joined VusionGorup in 2016 as Chief Financial Officer  contributing his significant experience to structure the information systems and processes that have enabled the Group's growth over the past few years. The Group's financial rigor and performance are his creation.“The Group's great strength resides in its solid management. In particular Philippe Bottine and Thierry Lemaitre have built two key pillars for the Group's performance  both in 2023 and for the future: success in the United States and financial strength”  concluded Thierry Gadou.About VusionGroupVusionGroup (ex- SES-imagotag) is the global leader in providing digitalization solutions for commerce  serving over 350 large retailer groups around the world in Europe  Asia and North America.

Ticker: VU – ISIN code: FR0010282822www.vusion.comInvestor Relations : Labrador – Raquel Lizarraga / +33 (0)6 46 71 55 20 / raquel.lizarraga.ext@vusion.comPress contact: vusiongroup@publicisconsultants.comNote on the IFRS Restatements related to the new Walmart contractTwo IFRS restatements related to the new Walmart contract impact 2023 financial disclosures:On June 2  2023  at their Annual General Meeting  the Group's shareholders approved a grant to Walmart of 1 761 200 of stock warrants on the Group's shares. According to IFRS standards  the fair value of these warrants should be calculated. On June 2  2023  the fair value of the warrants was established at €163m. A contract asset and a financial debt were thus recorded in the consolidated accounts for this amount.The contract asset  which is a fixed amount  is amortized in proportion to the forecast revenue generated by the Walmart contract over the duration of the roll-out of the VusionGroup platform in Walmart stores. The reduced revenue impact is customary as the warrants will only have a potential dilutive effect  which was modeled and communicated during the allocation of the warrants in early June 2023. This does not impact the actual sales invoiced to Walmart. This restatement has no impact on the Group's cash flow. It impacts revenue in 2023 by -€1.7m  and all of the Group's income statement lines  in the same proportion. This negative impact to the Group's IFRS accounts will continue until the end of the Walmart contract  in direct proportion to the sales generated by this contract.The financial debt is subject to revaluation at each closing  depending on the number of exercisable warrants and the market price of VusionGroup shares. Any change is recorded as financial income in the Group's consolidated accounts. As of December 31  2023  due to the drop in the stock price of SES-imagotag (now VusionGroup) shares compared to June 2  2023  the fair value of the warrants granted to Walmart decreased by €48.6m  which generated financial income of this amount in the Group's consolidated accounts. VusionGroup will continue to communicate at each closing the impact on revenue and net income of this IFRS restatement.The impact of future price reductions indexed to the volumes agreed upon with Walmart from the first deliveries of electronic shelf labels (ESLs): The cost of the Group's hardware solutions is a function of the volume manufactured. A significant increase in volume might thus lead to lower cost. Therefore  it has been agreed with this customer that they will be granted price reductions in relation to the future sales volume to which they contribute. The IFRS standard (IFRS 15) requires prices to be averaged over the life of the contract. The application of this restatement in 2023 impacts reported revenue (IFRS) and the margin by -€2.0m compared to the revenue invoiced  even though price reductions will only be granted if and when volumes will have reached certain thresholds. The application of this standard has a negative impact on revenue and all income statement lines  down to net profit.GlossaryEBITDAThe Group considers EBITDA to be a performance indicator that presents operating income before depreciation and amortization of fixed assets  adjusted for some items during the period that affect comparability with previous reporting periods. It also represents a good approximation of the cash flow generated by operating activities before taking into account investments and changes in working capital. Consequently  restatements include significant non-recurring items or items that will never lead to a cash disbursement.Net Financial Debt / Net CashThese indicators define  respectively  the Group's net financial debt or net cash position  calculated based on the following consolidated balance sheet items: (-) Loans (-) Current and non-current lease liabilities (IFRS16) (+) Cash and cash equivalents.If the result is negative  the level of Loans and lease liabilities exceeds the level of Cash and Cash equivalents  and is therefore considered net debt or net financial debt. If  however  the result is positive  then the level of Loans and lease liabilities is lower than the level of Cash and Cash equivalents and is considered Net Cash.Change in Net Financial Debt / Net CashIt is the change between the Net Financial Debt / Net Cash between 2 periods. It also corresponds to the Free Cash-Flow of the period.Change in Working CapitalChange in working capital is calculated based on the following items from the consolidated balance sheet: (+) Receivables (gross value  before depreciation) (+) inventory and works-in-progress (gross value  before depreciation) (-) trade payables (+) current taxes (+) other current receivable (-) other debt and accrual accounts.Order entriesOrder entries represents the year-to-date cumulative value of ESL orders received from customers. These orders are valued based on negotiated selling prices  i.e. before any impact of IFRS 15. Order intake also includes year-to-date VAS revenues.[1] Restated figures reflect the reported financials before adjusting for certain non-cash IFRS restatements related to the Walmart contract  which began in Q4 2023. The non-cash impact of these restatements is -€3.7m for actual sales invoiced on the new Walmart contract which started in Q4 2023. Net income also reflects a +€48.6m adjustment related to the revaluation of the fair value of the warrants granted to Walmart  which are subject to specific conditions. Please see the detailed explanatory note at the end of this press release.[2] VAS: Software  services  and non-ESL solutions[3] “Recurring VAS” revenue includes revenue generated by subscriptions to VusionCloud and its SaaS computer vision (Captana and Belive) and data analytics (Markethub and Memory) solutions  as well as contracts for recurring services.[4] “Non-recurring VAS” revenue includes the revenue generated by installation and non-recurring professional services; the sale of equipment such as Captana cameras  video rails and other screens used for retail media (Engage)  as well as the sale of industrial and logistical solutions (PDidigital).This publication embed ""🔒 Actusnews SECURITY MASTER "".- SECURITY MASTER Key: mGidaZuYl2zImmxwlJqYaGpqmmiUmGOVa2OYk2qcacrJmmpgl5eUaJXIZnFlnGxn- Check this key: https://www.security-master-key.com .Regulated information:Inside Information:- News release on accounts  results Full and original press release in PDF: https://www.actusnews.com/news/84771-vusiongroup_pr_fy_2023_eng_final.pdfReceive by email the next press releases of the company by registering on www.actusnews.com   it's free© 2024 ActusNews",neutral,0.27,0.72,0.01,positive,0.83,0.16,0.01,True,English,"['Strong Profitability Improvement', 'FY 2023 Results', 'Vusiongroup', 'significant M&A transactions', 'Several other significant contracts', ""5-year Vusion '27 strategic plan"", 'strategic R&D investments', 'next Annual General Meeting', 'Walmart U.S. contract', ""Vusion'27 strategic plan"", 'R&D strategy', 'challenging economic environment', 'ongoing profitability improvement', 'Global order entries', 'Strong Profitability Improvement', 'value-added local jobs', 'high value-added solutions', 'positive cash flow', '2024 full-year revenue target', 'strong profitability growth', 'strong international growth', 'total annual sales', 'Retail Media solutions', '2023 full year sales', 'next AGM', 'annual growth', 'Sharp improvement', 'strong degree', 'Positive Commerce', 'order book', 'Strong growth', 'net cash', 'cash impact', 'FY 2023 Results', 'Net income', '2023 financial figures', 'press release', 'IFRS15 Adjustment1', 'Thierry Gadou', 'decisive achievements', 'United States', 'consumer industries', 'turning point', 'ESG agenda', 'carbon intensity', 'carbon emissions', 'Paris Agreement', 'low-carbon e-commerce', 'food waste', 'responsible consumption', 'true strength', 'fulfilling work', 'recent changes', 'shareholder base', 'North America', 'decisive breakthrough', 'important axes', 'ESL solutions', 'Computer Vision', 'customer experience', 'important build', 'new entities', 'installed base', 'Cloud-connected ESLs', '82m ESLs', 'faster rate', 'profitable growth', 'VAS2 Growth', 'previous year', 'first year', 'year increase', 'IFRS standards', 'VAS sales', 'FY 2023 revenue', 'share dividend', 'notable progress', 'top line', 'operational performance', 'recurring services', 'EBITDA margin', 'VusionGroup share', 'adjusted terms', 'IFRS 15 adjustments', 'VAS revenue', 'The Group', '+30% growth', '2024 revenue', 'Q4', 'Details', '7 pts', 'Chairman', 'CEO', 'history', 'expansion', 'innovation', 'launch', 'EdgeSense', 'VusionOX', 'conclusion', 'acquisition', 'Memory', 'Belive', 'practice', 'future', 'efforts', 'objectives', 'path', 'alignment', 'Roadmap', 'customers', '900 employees', '40 nationalities', 'motivation', 'engine', 'culture', 'motivating', 'exciting', 'Board', 'Directors', 'task', 'governance', 'past', 'years', 'visibility', 'confidence', 'milestone', 'guidance', 'EMEA', 'Americas', 'Asia-Pacific', 'Rest', 'World', 'Cloud/SAAS', 'Data', 'stores', 'retailers', 'suppliers', 'advantage', 'digitization', 'regard', 'area', 'integration', 'collaboration', 'Captana', 'Markethub', 'Engage', 'innovative', 'parallel', 'teams', 'momentum', 'course', 'software', '2022', '€']",2024-03-27,2024-03-28,marketscreener.com
