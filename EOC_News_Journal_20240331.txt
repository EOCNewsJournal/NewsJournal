If you want to skip our overview of the Australian stock market  then...,In this piece  we will take a look at the ten best long term ASX stocks to invest in. If you want to skip our overview of the Australian stock market  then you can take a look at the 5 Best Long Term ASX Stocks To Invest In.Australia is one of the most prosperous nations in the world and stands shoulder to shoulder with the developed countries of Europe and North America when it comes to progress and quality of life. However  since most of the world's business flows through America  the U.S. stock market is considerably bigger. These facts also hold true for the European Euronext stock exchanges and the London Stock Exchange  especially since the latter is another hub for global finance.The Australian economy is quite advanced but also relies on traditional sectors such as mining. When it comes to analyzing the best ASX stocks  and particularly those that might be suitable for the long term  it is important to see which industries dominate Australia  what companies are operating in them  and what the future outlook for these sectors might be. On this front  data from the Reserve Bank of Australia can be of some help. Its data shows that the five biggest industries in Australia are mining  health and education  finance  construction  and manufacturing. Percentage wise  they account for 14.3%  12.8%  7.4%  7.1%  and 5.7% of the Australian economy  respectively.Building on this  the next thing to ask when thinking about the best ASX stocks is whether the current global macroeconomic environment is favorable for some of the biggest sectors of the Australian economy. Well  starting from the biggest Australian industry i.e. mining  this is one of the most sensitive businesses to global economic health. Since 27% of Australian exports go to China  and another 17.5% are headed to Japan  Asian economic health is a key determinant of Asian stock performance.If you've been following Insider Monkey and have signed up for our newsletter  you'll know that the Chinese economy has been struggling. In fact  even the International Monetary Fund (IMF) hasn't held back and called the economy a 'drag' on global output - a sentiment that comes after ill-fated analyst optimism at the start of 2023 that had seen many analysts opine that a robust recovery in China would prove to be a blessing for commodities and oil in particular. So  since Chinese growth has been lackluster  it's time to see how ASX mining stocks have fared amidst this.Story continuesSome notable ASX mining stocks  which trade exclusively on the Australian stock exchange and also through their American Depository Receipts (ADRs) on U.S. stock exchanges such as the NYSE are BHP Group Limited (NYSE:BHP)  Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO)  Fortescue Ltd (ASX:FMG.AX)  and South32 Limited (ASX:S32.AX). Year to date  their performance is -15.05%  -14.17%  -12.56%  and 10.98%  respectively. Looking at this  it's clear that all these stocks are down year to date and they were under pressure earlier this year when the Australian central bank's meeting minutes revealed that officials had actually considered an additional interest rate hike since they were uncertain that the beast of inflation had been fully tamed.However  while the biggest Australian industry might be struggling  ASX stocks for the second biggest sector namely health and education have done much better. A highly developed education system and a corruption free society have allowed Australian healthcare companies to hold their ground against their global counterparts. Some of the biggest healthcare ASX stocks are CSL Limited (ASX:CSL.AX)  Cochlear Limited (ASX:COH.AX)  ResMed Inc. (ASX:RMD.AX)  and Sonic Healthcare Limited (ASX:SHL.AX).Year to date  their performance is -0.13%  12.16%  18.75%  and -8.69%. Looking at this  it appears that healthcare ASX stocks have done much better than their mining counterparts  and even better than Australia's premier education consulting firm IDP Education Limited (ASX:IEL.AX) whose shares are down 9.59% year to date amidst a rating downgrade by Bell Porter and changes in Canadian visa rules to scrutinize unscrupulous applicants that seek to work in the country instead of studying there.Since healthcare is a hot ASX stock sector these days  here's what the management of Mesoblast Limited (NASDAQ:MESO)  an Australian regenerative medicine company had to say during the firm's Q2 2024 earnings call:As at December 31 2023  cash reserves were $77.6 million after completion of an institutional placement and entitlement offer of AUD60.3 million in the period. During the period  we also delivered on our planned cost containment strategies  which reduced our cash burn for operating activities. In the three-month period ended December 2023  our cash burn for operating activities was $12.3 million  which is a 25% reduction on the comparative three-month period in FY 2023. In the six-month period ended December 2023  the cash burn was reduced but 14% on the comparative six-month period in FY 2022. We are also pleased to report the 21% reduction in our loss after tax of $32.5 million.With these details in mind  let's take a look at some best long term ASX stocks. A couple of notable picks are Aristocrat Leisure Limited (ASX:ALL.AX)  Telstra Group Limited (ASX:TLS.AX)  and BHP Group Limited (NYSE:BHP).10 Best Long Term ASX Stocks To Invest InMarine Deswarte/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyTo make our list of the best ASX stocks for the long term  we ranked the forty most valuable ASX stocks by their average analyst share price target upside.
