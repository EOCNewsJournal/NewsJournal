Closing of the Annual General Meeting.Resolutions proposed by the Board of DirectorsItem 8 - Resolution regarding the allocation of the Company's profit in accordance with the adopted balance sheet.The Board of Directors proposes that no dividend is distributed and that the retained profit shall be carried forward to the new accounts.Item 15 - Resolution on the approval of the remuneration report.The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to approve the Board of Directors' remuneration report.Item 16 - Resolution to grant the Board of Directors the authority to resolve on an issue of new shares and/or convertibles  either applying or disapplying shareholders' preferential rights.The Board of Directors' proposal implies that the Board of Directors shall be authorised to  during the period until the next Annual General Meeting  resolve on new share issues and/or convertibles  on one or several occasions  with or without deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights and that shares and/or convertibles corresponding to maximum ten per cent (10%) of the Company's share capital as of the date for the first exercise of the authorisation may be issued. Further  the proposal implies that an issue may be made against cash payment  by set-off or by contribution in kind. In case of deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  shares and/or convertibles shall be issued on market terms. The purpose of the Board of Directors' proposal is to (i) enable the Company to completely or partially finance any future real property investments and/or acquisitions of real property companies/businesses by issuing new shares and/or convertibles as payment in connection with an acquisition agreement  alternatively to raise capital for such investments and/or acquisitions; and/or (ii) enable the Company to strengthen its financial position and/or create a larger liquidity buffer for financing commitments.Item 17 - Resolution to grant the Board of Directors the authority to resolve on acquisitions and transfers of the Company's own shares.The Board of Directors' proposal implies that the Board of Directors shall be authorised to  during the period until the next Annual General Meeting  resolve on acquisition on one or several occasions  of the Company's own shares provided that the Company after each acquisition will not hold more than ten per cent (10%) of all the shares in the Company  and to transfer all of the Company's own shares with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights. The objective of the Board of Directors' proposal is to allow the Company to adapt its capital structure to its capital needs from time to time and thereby contribute to an increased shareholder value  and/or to transfer own shares as payment in order to completely or partially finance any future real property investments and/or acquisitions of real property companies/businesses or by using own shares as payment in connection with an acquisition agreement  alternatively to raise capital for such investments and/or acquisitions. This objective does not allow the Company to trade with its own shares for the short-term purpose of making a profit.Item 18 - Resolution on (A) the implementation of a long-term performance share program (Performance Share Program 2024/2027) and (B) authorisation for the Board of Directors to resolve on the acquisition and transfer of shares to the participants in the Performance Share Program 2024/2027.The Board of Directors of Castellum proposes that the Annual General Meeting 2024 resolves on (A) the implementation of a long-term performance share program (the ""Performance Share Program 2024/2027"") and (B) the acquisition and transfer of shares to the participants in the Performance Share Program 2024/2027. If the Annual General Meeting does not support the proposal in item (B)  the Board of Directors proposes that (C) delivery of shares under the Performance Share Program 2024/2027 shall be conducted through entering into swap agreements with a third party.Background and rationaleThe Board of Directors considers it to be in the interest of the company and the shareholders that the interests of the executive management are aligned with those of the company and the shareholders through the company's executive management being offered participation in a performance share program  through which the executive management's holding of shares in Castellum will increase.In light of the terms  the size of the allotment and other circumstances  the Board of Directors considers that the Performance Share Program 2024/2027  as set out below  is fair and beneficial to the company and its shareholders.It is the Board of Directors' intention that the structure of the Performance Share Program 2024/2027 shall be on a long-term basis and the Board of Directors therefore intends to  following evaluation of the implementation of the Performance Share Program 2024/2027  present corresponding proposals regarding the implementation of performance share programs also to the upcoming Annual General Meetings of the company.The Board of Directors' proposal includes (A) the implementation of the Performance Share Program 2024/2027  (B) the authorisation for the Board of Directors to resolve on the acquisition and transfer of shares to the participants in the Performance Share Program 2024/2027 and  in case the Annual General Meeting does not support item (B)  (C) the transfer of shares under the Performance Share Program 2024/2027 through the company entering into a share swap agreement with a third party.A. The Board of Directors' proposal for a resolution on implementation of the Performance Share Program 2024/2027Participants in the Performance Share Program 2024/2027The Performance Share Program 2024/2027 is proposed to be directed to a total of not more than twelve (12) individuals divided into two categories: one category consisting of the CEO (one (1) individual) and one category consisting of other members of the executive management team (eleven (11) individuals).Investment requirementParticipation in the Performance Share Program 2024/2027 is conditional upon that the participant makes an own investment in the Castellum share and/or that the participant already holds shares in Castellum (""Investment Shares"")  and that the participant allocates the Investment Shares to the Performance Share Program 2024/2027. The CEO is required to allocate Investment Shares to the Performance Share Program 2024/2027 corresponding to two (2) monthly gross salaries and the other members of the executive management team are required to allocate Investment Shares to the Performance Program 2024/2027 corresponding to one (1) monthly gross salary. The allocation of the Investment Shares must be made no later than 10 June 2024. The Board of Directors shall be entitled to postpone the deadline for the allocation.Performance share rightsEach participant in the Performance Share Program 2024/2027 will be granted a certain number of performance share rights (""Performance Share Rights"")  free of charge. Each Performance Share Right gives the participants the right to  free of charge  receive one (1) share in Castellum (""Performance Share"") from Castellum or a designated third party  subject to fulfilment of the conditions for receiving Performance Shares. Allotment of Performance Shares is also subject to potential re-calculations  as set out below. The Performance Share Rights do not constitute securities and are not transferable.Granting of Performance Share Rights to the participants will take place on or around 13 June 2024. The Board of Directors shall be entitled to postpone the granting of Performance Share Rights.A participant will only be eligible to receive Performance Shares if:• the Investment Shares are retained by the participant during the period starting on 14 June 2024 and ending immediately following the day of announcement of the interim financial report for the first quarter of 2027 (the ""Vesting Period"") • the participant has remained in its employment with the company during the Vesting Period; and• the minimum performance target levels  as described below  are reached.Allotment of Performance Shares will  if the conditions are fulfilled  take place as soon as practicably possible following the expiration of the Vesting Period.The CEO shall be granted a number of Performance Share Rights which  at the time of receipt of the conditional right  shall have an underlying share value corresponding to seven and a half (7.5) monthly gross salaries. Other members of the executive management shall be granted a number of Performance Share Rights which  at the time of receipt of the conditional right  shall have an underlying share value corresponding to six (6) monthly gross salaries. The share price to be used as basis for the calculation shall be the volume-weighted average share price of the Castellum share on Nasdaq Stockholm during the 20 trading days following the Annual General Meeting 2024.The CEO may  based on the volume-weighted average share price paid for the Castellum share between 26 February 2024 and 22 March 2024 of SEK 130.34  be granted a maximum of 11 796 Performance Share Rights of series A and 11 796 Performance Share Rights of series B. Other members of the executive management may in total be granted a maximum of 38 944 Performance Share Rights of series A and 38 944 Performance Share Rights of series B.The extent (if any) to which the participants' Performance Share Rights will entitle to allotment of Performance Shares after the end of the Vesting Period will be determined on the basis of the degree of fulfillment of the performance conditions that are described below.Performance Share Rights of series A - total return on the Castellum share in absolute termsAllotment is conditional upon that the total return of the Castellum share in absolute terms during the period 1 January 2024 - 30 April 2027 (the ""Measurement Period"") amounts to  or exceeds  ten (10) percent. If the total return during the Measurement Period amounts to ten (10) percent  25 percent of the maximum number of Performance Shares that may be allotted on the basis of Performance Share Rights of series A will be allotted. Maximum allotment is conditional upon that the total return during the Measurement Period amounts to  or exceeds  50 percent. If the total return during the Measurement Period amounts to between 10 and 50 percent  allotment is calculated linearly between 25 percent and 100 percent.The total return on the Castellum share in absolute terms shall be calculated as follows:The entry price shall correspond to the average price of the Castellum share during January - April 2024. The comparison price shall correspond to the average price of the Castellum share during January - April 2027. When calculating the entry price and the comparison price  the average share price shall be deemed to correspond to the average of the highest and lowest bid prices calculated for each trading day according to Nasdaq Stockholm's official list prices. In the absence of a quoted price paid  the bid price quoted as the closing price shall instead be included in the calculation. A day without listings of either the price paid or the bid price shall not be included in the calculation. When calculating the total return for the Castellum share  dividends received by shareholders during the Measurement Period shall be considered. If dividends are paid during the period for calculating the average entry price or comparison price  the share price for the days the share is traded  including dividends  shall be reduced by the dividend amount. The total return of Castellum shares during the Measurement Period is re-calculated as a percentage.Performance Share Rights of series B - total return on the Castellum share in comparison with CRERX (Carnegie Real Estate Return Index)Allotment is conditional upon that the total return on the Castellum share exceeds the performance of CRERX during the Measurement Period. Maximum allotment is conditional upon that the total return compared to CRERX during the Measurement Period exceeds five (5) percentage points. Allotment is calculated linearly between zero (0) percentage points and five (5) percentage points.The calculation of the total return of the Castellum share in comparison with CRERX shall be made as follows:The total return of the Castellum share shall be calculated in accordance with what is stated above regarding Performance Share Rights of series A. The entry index shall correspond to the average index for CRERX during January - April 2024. The comparison index shall correspond to the average index for CRERX during January - April 2027. The comparison between the total return of the Castellum share and the development of CRERX is made on a percentage basis.RecalculationIn order to align the participants' and shareholders' interests  Castellum will compensate for dividends and other value transfers to shareholders during the Vesting Period by increasing the number of shares that each Performance Share Right entitles the participant to receive. The number of Performance Shares that each Performance Share Right may entitle to shall also be re-calculated in the event of a bonus issue  share split  reverse share split  and  if deemed reasonable and practical by the Board of Directors  similar events impacting the number of shares in Castellum.Hedging arrangementsIn order to implement the Performance Share Program 2024/2027 in a cost-efficient manner  the Board of Directors has considered different methods for securing the delivery of shares to the participants and the company's exposure towards costs and social security contributions that may arise as a consequence of the Performance Share Program 2024/2027. The Board of Directors has thereupon found that the most cost-efficient alternative would be  and thus proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves upon an authorisation for the Board of Directors to resolve on the acquisition and transfer of own shares  free of charge  to participants in the Performance Share Program 2024/2027  and on the transfer of own shares to a third party. More detailed terms and conditions for the Board of Directors' main alternative are set out in item (B) below.Should the majority required for the resolution to transfer the company's own shares not be reached  the Board of Directors proposes that Castellum shall instead be able to enter into a share swap agreement with a third party  in accordance with item (C) below.DilutionNeither of the hedging alternatives proposed by the Board of Directors (in accordance with what is set out under ""Hedging arrangements"" above as well as under items (B) and (C) below) will give rise to any increases in the number of shares in the company and  accordingly  no dilutive effect will occur for existing shareholders by reason of the Performance Share Program 2024/2027.OtherA decision on participation in  or implementation of  the Performance Share Program 2024/2027 requires that the participation is legally possible and that the Board of Directors deems that the participation or implementation is possible with reasonable administrative costs and financial efforts.The Board of Directors shall be responsible for the details and management of the Performance Share Program 2024/2027 within the framework of the main terms set out above  including to resolve on the final timeline for the Performance Share Program 2024/2027  and the Board of Directors shall be authorised to make the minor adjustments to these conditions as required by law or for administrative reasons. The Board of Directors shall also be authorised to adjust or deviate from the terms as required by local laws and regulations and existing market practices.B. The Board of Directors' proposal for acquisition and transfer of Castellum's shares to the participants in the Performance Share Program 2024/2027The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to authorise the Board of Directors to  during the period until the next Annual General Meeting  resolve on the acquisition of up to 172 000 of Castellum's shares through trading on Nasdaq Stockholm.The purpose of the proposed authorisation of the Board of Directors to repurchase shares in Castellum is to secure the delivery of Performance Shares to the participants under the Performance Share Program 2024/2027 and hedge the company's exposure towards social security contributions that may arise as a consequence of Performance Share Program 2024/2027.In addition  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves that transfer of a maximum of 172 000 shares in Castellum may be carried out in accordance with the conditions set out below. The number of shares is calculated on the basis of maximum participation in the Performance Share Program 2024/2027  with a buffer for a potential decrease in the share price and potential dividend compensation  and corresponds to approximately 0.04 percent of the total number of registered shares in Castellum as of the date of this proposal.Acquisitions of the shares shall be made on Nasdaq Stockholm at a price per share within the prevailing price interval in accordance with applicable rules.132 270 shares in Castellum may be transferred to participants in the Performance Share Program 2024/2027. Transfer of shares to the participants in the Performance Share Program 2024/2027 shall be made without consideration and shall be carried out at the time and subject to the conditions under which participants in the Performance Share Program 2024/2027 have the right to receive Performance Shares.39 730 shares in Castellum may be transferred to a third party for the purpose of bringing in capital to cover the exposure towards social security contributions that may arise based on the allotment of Performance Shares. Transfer of shares to a third party shall be made at market price.The number of shares in Castellum that may be transferred under the Performance Share Program 2024/2027 may be subject to re-calculation in the event of a bonus issue  share split  reverse share split  preferential rights issue and similar events impacting the number of shares in Castellum.The Board of Directors' statement in accordance with Chapter 19  Section 22 of the Swedish Companies Act is appended to this proposal.C. The Board of Directors' proposal for a share swap agreement with a third partyThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting 2024  in the event that necessary majority is not obtained for item (B) above  resolves to secure delivery of shares under the Performance Share Program 2024/2027 by the company entering into a share swap agreement with a third party  whereby the third party in its own name shall acquire and transfer the company's shares to the participants in the Performance Share Program 2024/2027. The relevant number of shares in this context shall correspond to the number of shares proposed to be acquired and transfered under item (B) above.Costs for the Performance Share Program 2024/2027The Board of Directors considers that the Performance Share Program 2024/2027 will result in costs mainly related to administration  accounting payroll costs and social security costs.The total administration costs are expected to be marginal compared to the other costs of the Performance Share Program 2024.The Performance Share Rights will be expensed as personnel costs over the Vesting Period  without impacting the company's cash flow. If Performance Shares are allotted  the Performance Share Program 2024/2027 will incur additional costs in the form of social security costs. The total social security costs depend on the participant's employment status  the number of Performance Shares vested  and the value of the benefit received by the participant  i.e.  the value of the Performance Shares upon allotment in 2027. Social security costs will be expensed in the income statement during the Vesting Period based on the value of the Performance Share Rights.Based on the assumptions that the share price at the time of allotment of Performance Share Rights is SEK 130.34  which means that 101 479 Performance Share Rights will be allotted  that all Performance Share Rights allotted in the Performance Share Program 2024/2027 vest  an assumed share price of SEK 196 upon the allotment of the Performance Shares and an assumed average percentage for social security costs of approximately 31.42 percent  the total costs for the program  including social security costs  are estimated to amount to SEK 15.4 million during the period 2024 - 2027  corresponding to an average of SEK 5.1 million per year  corresponding to approximately 0.9 percent of the company's total annual employee expenses (including social security costs) calculated on personnel expenses for the fiscal year 2023.Based on the same assumptions as set out above  however with the difference that all 132 270 Performance Shares under the Performance Share Program 2024/2027 are allotted and vested  the total costs for the program  including social security costs  are estimated to amount to SEK 17.3 million during the period 2024 - 2027  corresponding to an average of SEK 5.8 million per year  corresponding to approximately 1.0 percent of the company's total annual employee expenses (including social security costs) calculated on personnel expenses for the fiscal year 2023.All calculations above are preliminary and are only intended to provide an illustration of the costs that the Performance Share Program 2024/2027 may entail. Actual costs may thus deviate from what is stated above.The costs estimated to result from the Performance Share Program 2024/2027 are in line with the costs resulting from the company's existing long-term share price related incentive programs. In addition  the Board of Directors considers the positive effects expected to result from the Performance Share Program 2024/2027 to outweigh the costs attributable to the Performance Share Program 2024/2027.Effects on key figures and dilutionCastellum's operating profit for the financial year 2023 amounted to SEK 1 030 million. The estimated annual costs for the Performance Share Program 2024/2027 of SEK 5.1 million in accordance with the above correspond to approximately 0.5 percent of the operating result for the financial year 2023.Full allotment of Performance Shares  including the buffer for a potential dividend compensation  entails  based on the example share price set out above  that the total number of shares under the Performance Share Program 2024/2027 will amount to no more than 132 270 shares  which corresponds to 0.03 percent of the number of outstanding shares in the company as of the date of this proposal.If the 39 730 shares that may be transferred to a third party for the purpose of bringing in capital to cover the exposure towards social security contributions is taken into account  the total number of shares under the Performance Share Program 2024/2027 will amount to no more than 172 000 shares  which corresponds to 0.04 percent of the number of outstanding shares in the company as of the date of this proposal.Other share-based incentive programsThe company currently has ongoing share price-based incentive programs  but no other ongoing share-based incentive programs.Preparation of the proposalThe proposal has been prepared by the People Committee and the Board of Directors together with external advisors.Resolutions proposed by the Nomination CommitteeThe Nomination Committee  consisting of Kerstin Engström appointed by Akelius Residential Property AB (publ)  Johannes Wingborg appointed by Länsförsäkringar Fondförvaltning AB (publ)  Helen Fasth Gillstedt (Chair of the Nomination Committee) appointed by Handelsbanken Fonder  Richard Torgerson appointed by Nordea Fonder and the Chair of the Board of Directors  Per Berggren  has made the following proposals:Item 1 - Election of the Chair of the meeting.The Nomination Committee proposes the attorney Wilhelm Lüning to preside as Chair of the Annual General Meeting.Item 11A - Determination of the number of members of the Board of Directors.The Board of Directors is proposed to consist of six Board members.Item 11B - Determination of the number of auditors and deputy auditors.The number of auditors is proposed to be one with no deputy auditor.Item 12A - Determination of the remuneration to be paid to the members of the Board of Directors.Remuneration to the members of the Board of Directors is proposed to be the following (2023 remuneration within brackets).• The Chair of the Board of Directors: SEK 1 150 000 (SEK 1 110 000).• The Vice Chair of the Board of Directors: SEK 665 000 (-).• Each of the other members of the Board of Directors: SEK 465 000 (SEK 450 000).• Chair of the People Committee: SEK 100 000 (SEK 100 000).• Each of the other members of the People Committee: SEK 75 000 (SEK 75 000).• Chair of the Audit Committee: SEK 240 000 (SEK 220 000).• Each of the other members of the Audit Committee: SEK 110 000 (SEK 105 000).• A member of the Board of Directors who is employed by the Company shall not receive remuneration.Item 12B - Determination of the remuneration to be paid to the auditor.It is proposed that the auditor's fee shall be paid upon approval of its invoices.Item 13 - Election of members of the Board of Directors and Chair of the Board of Directors.The existing Board members Per Berggren  Anna-Karin Celsing  Henrik Käll  Louise Richnau  Ann-Louise Lökholm-Klasson and Pål Ahlsén are proposed to be re-elected as Board members.Per Berggren is proposed to be elected as Chair of the Board of Directors.

Item 17 - Adoption of guidelines on compensation for senior executivesGuidelines on compensation for senior executives The Board of Directors of Norion Bank AB proposes that the Annual General Meeting adopt the following guidelines for the remuneration of senior executives to apply until the 2028 Annual General Meeting at the latest. Applicable regulationsRemunerations to senior executives are to be determined in accordance with these guidelines and Norion's remuneration policy  which is based on Swedish and European legislation and other regulations on remuneration systems for the banking sector  the Swedish Code of Corporate Governance  as well as generally accepted practices for a sound remuneration structure. Scope of applicationThese guidelines include Company Management and Board members insofar as remunerations other than those approved by the Annual General Meeting are to be paid to Board members. Company management refers to the CEO  Deputy CEO and other persons in the management team  as well as employees who have the overall responsibility for any of the Company's control functions  regardless of whether these are from time to time included in the Company's management team or not. The guidelines shall apply to agreed remunerations and changes made to already agreed remunerations  following the adoption of the guidelines by the 2024 Annual General Meeting. The guidelines do not include remunerations approved by the Annual General Meeting. Regarding terms of employment governed by regulations other than Swedish regulations  appropriate adjustments may be made to comply with any such regulations or established local practices that are mandatory  in connection with which the general purposes of these guidelines should be met to the greatest possible extent. How these guidelines promote the Company's business strategy  long-term interests and sustainabilityNorion Bank Group is a business-oriented Nordic financing bank. The Group's brands - Norion Bank  Walley and Collector - offer customized financing solutions that meet distinct needs in three customer segments: medium-sized corporates and real estate companies  merchants  and private individuals. As a specialist in financing solutions  Norion Bank Group is a leading complement to traditional large banks  with a vision of being the leading Nordic financing bank in its chosen segments. Norion Bank's strategy is to maintain good risk adjusted profitabilityNorion Bank offers corporate and real estate loans  as well as factoring for medium-sized corporates and real estate companies. The Walley brand offers flexible payment and checkout solutions to merchants and private individuals. The Collector brand offers personal loans and credit cards to private customers  as well as savings accounts to private individuals and companies. The successful implementation of the Company's business strategy and the fostering of the Company's long-term interests  including its sustainability  requires the Company to be able to recruit and retain qualified employees. This requires the Company to be able to offer competitive remunerations. These guidelines make it possible for Company Management to be offered competitive total remuneration. Forms of remuneration  etc.Remunerations shall be on market terms and consist of the following components: fixed cash salary  pension provisions and other non-monetary benefits. To avoid Company Management being encouraged to take unsound risks  no variable remuneration is to be paid  with the exception of what is stated below. Consequently  fixed remuneration  combined with pension provisions and non-monetary benefits  constitute the employee's total remuneration. Furthermore  the Annual General Meeting may resolve to offer long-term incentive programmes  such share- or share price-related remunerations or incentive programmes. Such long-term incentive programmes are to be approved by the Annual General Meeting and are therefore not covered by these guidelines. Variable cash remuneration may be paid in exceptional circumstances  provided that such extraordinary arrangements are limited in terms of time and applied only at the individual level  either for the purpose of recruiting or retaining executives  or as compensation for extraordinary efforts beyond the ordinary duties of the individual. Such variable remuneration may not  however  be linked to the Company's financial targets or similar  which could lead to the employees concerned being enticed to take unsound risks. Such remunerations may not exceed an amount corresponding to 20 percent of the fixed annual cash salary and shall not be paid more than once per year and per individual. Decisions regarding such remuneration shall be made by the Board of Directors  based on a proposal from the Remuneration Committee. Fixed salaryEach member of Company Management shall be offered a fixed salary on market terms and based on the complexity of the job and the executive's experience  responsibility  competence and performance. The fixed salary is revised annually. PensionsEach member of the Company Management team shall be offered a pension on market terms in the country where the executive has his or her permanent residence. For the CEO and other senior executives  pension benefits  including health insurance  must be defined-contribution benefits. Pension premiums for defined-contribution pensions shall amount to a maximum of 30 percent of the fixed annual cash salary. Non-monetary benefitsNon-monetary benefits shall facilitate the executives' work performance and correspond to what can be considered reasonable considering market practices. Non-monetary benefits may include  for example  life insurance  health insurance and a car benefit. Premiums and other costs arising from such benefits may amount to a maximum of 15 percent of the fixed annual cash salary. Regarding terms of employment governed by regulations other than Swedish regulations  where these concern pension and other benefits  appropriate adjustments may be made to comply with any regulations or established local practices that are mandatory  in connection with which the general purposes of these guidelines should be met to the greatest possible extent. Cessation of employmentFixed cash salary during the notice period and severance pay may not  in total  exceed an amount corresponding to the fixed cash salary for two years for the CEO and 18 months for other senior executives. The severance pay may not exceed an amount corresponding to the fixed cash salary for 12 months. On cessation of employment by the Company  the period of notice may not exceed 12 months. On termination by the executive  the period of notice may not exceed six months  without entitlement to severance pay. In addition  for the CEO and Deputy CEO  compensation for undertakings limiting competition may be payable on termination of employment to compensate for possible loss of income. For the CEO  such compensation for undertakings limiting competition shall only be payable to the extent that the former executive is not entitled to severance pay. For the CEO  this remuneration shall correspond to the discrepancy between the fixed cash salary at the time of termination less any lower income earned by the CEO in new employment  while for the Deputy CEO  this remuneration shall correspond to the discrepancy between the fixed cash salary at the time of termination less any lower income earned by the Deputy CEO in new employment  although not more than 60 percent of the fixed cash salary at the time of termination. This remuneration shall be payable during the period during which undertakings limiting competition apply  which shall not exceed 12 months following the termination of employment. Salary and terms of employment for employeesIn preparing the Board's proposal for these remuneration guidelines  the salaries and terms of employment for the Company's employees have been taken into account in that information regarding employees' total remuneration  the components of the remuneration and the rate of increase and the increase over time has been included in the data on which the Remuneration Committee and the Board of Directors have based their decisions and assessed the reasonableness of the guidelines and the limitations they entail. The decision-making process to establish  review and implement the guidelinesThe Board of Directors has established a Remuneration Committee. The committee's tasks include preparing the Board of Directors' decision on proposals for guidelines for remunerations to senior executives. The Board of Directors shall draw up proposals for new guidelines at least every four years and submit the proposal for resolution at the Annual General Meeting. The guidelines shall apply until new guidelines have been adopted by the Annual General Meeting. The Remuneration Committee shall also  where applicable  monitor and assess programmes of variable remuneration for Company Management  the application of guidelines for remuneration to senior executives as well as current remuneration structures and remuneration levels within the Company. The Chairman of the Board is the chairman of the Remuneration Committee. The other members of the Remuneration Committee are independent in relation to the Company and Company Management. When the Board of Directors addresses and makes decisions on remuneration-related matters  the CEO and other members of the Company Management shall not be in attendance  insofar as they are affected by the matters addressed. Remuneration of Board MembersIn exceptional cases  Board members elected by the Annual General Meeting may be engaged to perform work that goes beyond the work of the Board and it shall be possible for them to receive remuneration for such work. Such efforts may include instances where the Company lacks the internal expertise or resources necessary. Furthermore  only operational efforts may be called upon  not strategic efforts  and these may not interfere with the actions of the Company Management or otherwise contravene the Companies Act or the Swedish Code of Corporate Governance. The remuneration shall be market-based and shall be approved by the Board of Directors without the Board member concerned participating in the preparation of the appurtenant proposals or decisions. Departure from the guidelinesThe Board of Directors may decide to temporarily deviate from the guidelines in whole or in part  if there are specific reasons for this in an individual case and a departure is necessary to meet the Company's long-term interests  including its sustainability  or to ensure the Company's financial viability. As stated above  the tasks of the Remuneration Committee include preparing the Board's decision on remuneration issues  which includes decisions on deviations from the guidelines. ________ Description of significant changes to the guidelines and how the shareholders' views have been taken into accountThe Board of Directors has not received any views from the shareholders on existing guidelines for the remuneration of senior executives. The Board of Directors' proposed guidelines for the remuneration of senior executives corresponds for the most parts to the remuneration guidelines adopted by the Annual General Meeting of Collector Bank AB (which changed name to Norion Bank AB in 2023). Editorial amendments and adaptations have been made given the change of name and clarified business strategy  as well as the regulations regarding termination of employment having been clarified with the effect that severance pay may comprise an amount equivalent to fixed cash salary for 12 months. Item 18 - Resolution to authorize the Board to decide to issue new sharesThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolve to authorize the Board of Directors to decide  on one or more occasions and with or without deviation from the preferential rights of existing shareholders  for cash payment  payment in kind or through set-off  to issue shares corresponding to at most 10 percent of the total number of shares in the Company during the period until the next Annual General Meeting. The subscription price shall be determined according to prevailing market conditions at the time the shares are issued. The reasons for the authorization and for the option of deciding to issue shares deviating from the preferential rights of existing shareholders are that the Board of Directors wishes to increase the Company's financial flexibility and enable a rapid and effective adjustment of the Company's capital structure to set financial targets and changes in capital adequacy rules. A share issue deviating from shareholders' preferential rights also makes it possible for the Company to issue shares as payment in connection with possible acquisitions of companies or operations by the Company. To be valid  a resolution in accordance with the Board's proposal requires the approval of shareholders representing at least two thirds of both the votes and the shares represented at the Annual General Meeting. Item 19 - Resolution to authorize the Board of Directors to determine repurchases and transfers of treasury sharesThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to authorize the Board  for the period until the next Annual General Meeting  to decide  on one or more occasions  to repurchase shares such that the Company does not hold more than 10 percent of the total number of shares in Norion  on the condition that such acquisitions are approved by the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority. Repurchases may only be made via the Nasdaq Stockholm exchange  either at a price within the current price range  that is  the interval between the highest purchase price and the lowest selling price or  in the case of repurchases conducted by brokerage firms on the Company's behalf  the price of the shares may correspond to the volume-weighted average price during the period in which the shares were repurchased  even if the volume-weighted average price is outside the price range on the date on which the shares are transferred to Norion. The shares must be paid for in cash. The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to authorize the Board  for the period until the next Annual General Meeting  to approve  on one or more occasions  transfers of the Company's own shares. Shares may be transferred in a quantity not exceeding the total number the Company's own shares held by Norion at any given time. Transfers may be conducted on or off the Nasdaq Stockholm exchange  meaning that the Board of Directors may approve deviations from shareholders' pre-emption rights  as well as set-off payment or payment in kind. Transfers of shares on the Nasdaq Stockholm exchange shall be conducted at a price within the price interval applicable at any given time. Transfers of shares off the Nasdaq Stockholm exchange shall be conducted at a cash price  or value of the property received  corresponding to the market price for Norion's shares at the time of transfer  with any discrepancy deemed appropriate by the Board of Directors in each instance. The purpose of these authorizations is that the Board of Directors seeks to enable the Company to use its own shares in payment for any acquisitions of companies or operations that the Company may make  as well as increasing the Company's financial flexibility and enabling adjustments to the Company's capital structure in line with prevailing conditions to thereby contribute to increased shareholder value. To be valid  a resolution in accordance with the Board's proposal requires the approval of shareholders representing at least two thirds of both the votes and the shares represented at the Annual General Meeting. OTHER INFORMATION AuthorizationThe Board  or whoever the Board appoints  shall have the right to decide on the minor changes in the above decisions that may be required in connection with registration of the decisions with the Swedish Companies Registration Office (Bolagsverket)  the Swedish Financial Supervisory Authority (Finansinspektionen)  Euroclear Sweden AB or due to other formal requirements.

Resolution on guidelines for appointing the nomination committee The nomination committee proposes that the nomination committee for the annual general meeting 2025 consists of representatives of the four largest  directly registered or owner grouped  shareholders according to the number of votes per 30 September 2024  according to ownership statistics from Euroclear Sweden AB and other reliable information that has been given to the company at this time. If there is a change in the ownership structure of the company after 30 September 2024 but before the date which takes place two months prior to the next annual general meeting  and if a shareholder which after this change has become one of the four largest shareholders in the company  seen to the number of votes  notifies the Chair of the nomination committee that it wishes to be part of the nomination committee  this shareholder shall have the right either to appoint one further member of the nomination committee or  if the nomination committee so decides  to appoint a member of the nomination committee who shall replace the member which  after the ownership change  is the smallest shareholder seen to the number of votes and who has been appointed member by the nomination committee. A member appointed by a shareholder which after 30 September 2024 has sold more than half of its shareholding  and which thereby no longer is one of the ten largest shareholders in the company  is obliged to resign from the company's nomination committee within two weeks after the date of the sale. The nomination committee furthermore has the right to adjoin the Chair of the board to the meetings of the nomination committee. The chair of the board shall convene the first meeting. The nomination committee shall prepare and make proposals to the annual general meeting of election of chair of the meeting  election of chair of the board and other board members  the fee to be allocated between the chairman and the other board members  compensation  if any  for work with the committees and election of auditor and fees to the auditors as well as decision on principles for the appointment of a nomination committee. If any member leaves the nomination committee before his/her work is completed  the shareholder who appointed the member shall firstly be offered the opportunity to appoint a new member or  if this is not made  the next of the larger shareholders shall be given the opportunity to appoint a member. Item 16. Resolution on principles for remuneration  and other employment conditions  for senior executives The Board proposes that the annual general meeting 2024 resolves that the following guidelines for remuneration to senior executives shall apply until the annual general meeting 2028 unless circumstances arise that necessitate an earlier revision. These guidelines cover remuneration to board members  the CEO  deputy CEO and the executive management. The guidelines shall be applied to remunerations agreed upon  and changes made to already agreed remunerations  after the guidelines have been adopted by the annual general meeting 2024. The guidelines do not cover remunerations resolved upon by the general meeting. The guidelines' promotion of the company's business strategy and long-term interests  including sustainability The combination of digitalization and rapid development in areas such as cloud technologies  cybersecurity  and artificial intelligence is making customers' IT infrastructure increasingly complex  with growing volumes of information. To remain relevant to customers  Proact must continue to ensure a very good customer experience as well as provide a market-leading offering and delivery model. To achieve this  Proact works according to the following strategies: Establish a clear position in local marketsOffer a relevant and competitive portfolio of products and servicesProfessionalize and streamline the company's service deliveryDrive employee engagement and developmentAccelerate growth through acquisitions A successful implementation of the company's business strategy and the achievement of the company's long-term interests  including its sustainability  requires that the company can recruit and retain qualified employees. For this  the company must be able to offer competitive remuneration. These guidelines enable senior executives to be offered competitive total remuneration. Variable cash remuneration covered by these guidelines should aim to promote the company's business strategy and long-term interests  including its sustainability. Forms of remuneration  etc.The remuneration should be market-based and may consist of the following components: fixed cash salary  variable cash remuneration  pension benefits  and other benefits. In addition  and independently of these guidelines  the general meeting may decide on  for example  share and share price-related remunerations. The fixed cash salary for senior executives should be competitive within the market. The fixed cash salary for senior executives is reviewed annually. The fixed cash salary constitutes a maximum of 75 percent of the total remuneration at the maximum outcome of variable cash remuneration. The fulfillment of criteria for the payment of variable cash remuneration shall be measurable over a period of one or several years. Variable cash remuneration constitutes a maximum of 50 percent of the total remuneration at the maximum outcome of variable cash remuneration for a certain fiscal year. The company does not have the right to reclaim variable cash remuneration. The company does not apply deferral periods for variable cash remuneration. Additional variable cash compensation may be awarded in extraordinary circumstances  provided that such extraordinary arrangements are time-limited and made on an individual basis either for the purpose of recruiting or retaining senior executives  or as compensation for extraordinary efforts beyond the person's regular duties. Additional variable cash compensation may not be granted more than once per year and per individual. Decisions on additional cash compensation shall be made by the Board upon recommendation from the remuneration committee. Additional variable cash compensation  together with variable cash compensation as mentioned above  may constitute a maximum of 60 percent of the total remuneration at the maximum outcome of variable cash compensation as mentioned above. Variable cash compensation shall not be pensionable  unless otherwise dictated by mandatory law or collective agreement provisions. For the CEO  pension benefits  including health insurance  shall be defined contribution. For the CEO  pension benefits  including health insurance  constitute a maximum of 20 percent of the total remuneration at the maximum outcome of variable cash compensation. For other senior executives  pension benefits  including health insurance  shall be defined contribution unless the executive is covered by a defined benefit pension according to mandatory collective agreement provisions. For other senior executives  pension benefits  including health insurance  constitute a maximum of 20 percent of the total remuneration at the maximum outcome of variable cash compensation. Other benefits may include  among others  life insurance  health insurance  and car benefits. Other benefits constitute a maximum of 15 percent of the total remuneration at the maximum outcome of variable cash compensation. Regarding employment conditions subject to regulations other than Swedish  appropriate adjustments may be made to comply with mandatory rules or established local practices in the country of the individual's employment  whereby the overarching purpose of these guidelines should be fulfilled as far as possible. Termination of employment Employment or service contracts for senior executives should be valid permanently or for a fixed period. Upon termination by the company  the notice period may be up to twelve months. The combined fixed cash salary during the notice period and severance pay shall not exceed an amount corresponding to eighteen monthly salaries for all senior executives. Upon termination by the senior executive  the notice period may be up to six months  without the right to severance pay. Criteria for Awarding Variable Cash Compensation  etc. The variable cash compensation should be linked to the fulfillment of criteria set annually or with another periodicity  for either the company's performance and/or the individual's performance. This makes the variable cash compensation clearly connected to the company's development and/or the individual's work effort and performance. The criteria may be financial or non-financial  qualitative or quantitative  and should be designed to promote the company's business strategy and long-term interests  including its sustainability. After the measurement period for the fulfillment of criteria for the payment of variable cash compensation has concluded  it should be determined to what extent the criteria have been met. Variable cash compensation for the CEO should be prepared by the remuneration committee and decided by the Board. Variable cash compensation for other senior executives should be prepared and decided by the CEO. As far as financial criteria are concerned  the assessment should be based on relevant financial information. Salary and Employment Conditions for employees In the preparation of the Board's proposal for these remuneration guidelines  salary and employment conditions for the Group's employees were taken into account by including information on employees' total compensation  the components of compensation  and the rate and pace of increase in compensation over time as part of the remuneration committee's and the board's decision-making basis when evaluating the fairness of the guidelines and the limitations that follow from them. The annual change in compensation for the company's CEO and Deputy CEO on the one hand  and the change in the average compensation in full-time equivalents for the company's other employees on the other hand  will be disclosed in the compensation report. The Decision-Making Process for Establishing  Reviewing  and Implementing the Guidelines The Board has established a remuneration committee. The Chair of the Board may serve as the Chair of the remuneration committee. To handle conflicts of interest  the other members of the remuneration committee  elected by the general meeting  must be independent in relation to the company and its senior management. If the Board finds it more appropriate  the entire Board can perform the tasks of the remuneration committee  provided that any Board member who is part of the senior management does not participate in the work. The tasks of the remuneration committee include preparing the Board's decisions on proposals for guidelines for remuneration to senior executives. The Board should prepare a proposal for new guidelines at least every fourth year and submit the proposal for decision at the annual general meeting. The guidelines shall apply until new guidelines are adopted by the general meeting. The remuneration committee is also responsible for monitoring and evaluating programs for variable compensation for the management  the application of guidelines for remuneration to senior executives  and the current compensation structures and compensation levels within the company. During the Board's consideration and decisions on compensation-related matters  the CEO or other members of the senior management do not attend  insofar as they are affected by the matters. If the annual general meeting decides not to adopt the guidelines due to a proposal to that effect  the Board must present a new proposal before the next annual general meeting. In such cases  compensation shall be paid in accordance with the guidelines that previously applied or  if no such guidelines exist  in accordance with the company's practice. Deviating from the Guidelines The Board may decide to temporarily deviate from the guidelines  in whole or in part  if there are special reasons for doing so in an individual case and a deviation is necessary to serve the company's long-term interests  including its sustainability  or to ensure the company's financial stability. If such deviations occur  this must be reported in the compensation report before the next annual general meeting. As mentioned above  it is part of the remuneration committee's tasks to prepare the Board's decisions on compensation matters  which includes proposals for decisions on deviations from the guidelines. Review of the Guidelines A review of the guidelines for remuneration to senior executives has been conducted ahead of the annual general meeting 2024. The review has primarily resulted in some editorial changes. The above modifications are not expected to result in any significant change to the remuneration paid according to the currently applicable guidelines. Item 17. Resolution on Performance Share Program 2024 The Board proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to implement a performance share program (""Performance Share Program 2024""). This proposal is divided into four items: Terms of the Performance Share Program 2024. Hedging by the transfer of own shares. Hedging via a share swap agreement with a third party. Other matters related to Performance Share Program 2024. (A)Terms of the Performance Share Program 2024 A.1Performance Share Program 2024 in short The Board want to implement Performance Share Program 2024 for current and future employees in the company in order to encourage a personal long-term ownership in the company  and in order to increase and strengthen the potential for recruiting  retaining and motivating current and future employees in the company and its subsidiary. Therefore  the Board proposes that the general meeting approves the implementation of Performance Share Program 2024 for current and future employees in the company and its subsidiary. The proposed Performance Share Program 2024 follows the same structure as the performance share program resolved at the annual general meeting 2023. Participation in the Performance Share Program 2024 is conditional upon that the participant makes an own investment in shares in Proact shares. Participants may  after a qualification period  receive allotments of Proact shares without consideration  depended on the fulfilment of certain conditions. In order for the participant to be entitled to receive allotment of Proact shares  it is required that the participant remains an employee of the company or its subsidiary during the full qualification period  and that the investment in Proact shares has remained in its entirety during the same period. Furthermore  allotment of Proact shares requires the fulfilment of performance targets linked to the company earnings per share  turnover and return on capital employed. The term of Performance Share Program 2024 is approximately three years. Performance Share Program 2024 has been designed to reward the participants for increased shareholder value by allotting Proact shares  based on the fulfilment of financial targets. By linking the current and future employees' remuneration to the development of the company's future results and value growth  the long-term growth of the company is rewarded. Based on these circumstances  the Board considers that the implementation of the Performance Share Program 2024 will have a positive effect on the company's continued development  and will therefore be beneficial to the shareholders and the company. A.2Participants in the Performance Share Program 2024 The Performance Share Program 2024 is directed to a total number of not more than 20 of the current and future employees of the company or its subsidiary  divided into three categories. Category A consists of the CEO (not more than one (1) individual)  category B consists of the current and future members of the group management team (not more than nine (9) individuals)  and category C consists of current and future key employees (not more than ten (10) individuals. Any resolution on participation or implementation of Performance Share Program 2024 shall be conditional on that it  in the Board's judgement  can be offered with reasonable administrative costs and financial effects. Additional employees who have been recruited by the company or its subsidiary  after the expiration of the initial subscription period  may be offered to participate in the Performance Share Program 2024. The remaining term of the Performance Share Program 2024 may be less than three years upon the addition of such new employees to the Performance Share Program 2024. The reason for the inclusion of new employees after the expiration of the initial subscription period is that it is considered to be of great value for the company and its subsidiaries to quickly incorporate new employees into the corresponding incentive structure that applies to other employees covered by the Performance Share Program 2024. However  the inclusion of new employees to the Performance Share Program 2024 may not occur later than 31 December 2024. A.3The personal investment and allocation of share rights To participate in the Performance Share Program 2024 the participant is required to acquire and lock up Proact shares within the Performance Share Program 2024 (""Investment Shares""). Participants in category A may acquire not more than 4 000 Investment Shares  participants in category B may acquire note more than 2 000 Investment Shares  and participants in category C may acquire not more than 1 250 Investment Shares. However  participation in the Performance Share Program 2024  it is required that the participant - regardless of the category they belong to - acquires at least 500 Investment Shares. If the participant is in possession of insider information and is therefore unable to acquire Proact shares in connection with the registration of the Performance Share Program 2024  the acquisition of Proact shares shall occur as soon as possible when such obstacle has ceased and the acquisition is possible  however no later than 31 December 2024. The participant shall receive seven (7) share rights for each Investment Share. The allotment of Proact shares will occur during limited time period after the end of the vesting period  which runs from the date of agreement on participation in the Performance Share Program 2024  until the day of the presentation of Proact's interim report for the first quarter of 2027 (the ""Vesting Period""). If allotment of Proact shares occurs after the presentation of Proact's interim report for the first quarter of 2027  the term of the Performance Share Program 2024 may be less than three years. The reason for the allotment of Performance Shares still being allowed during the aforementioned period is that the risk of insiders holding insider information increases gradually after the presentation of the aforementioned quarterly report. If the participant has insider information and is therefore prevented from receiving Proact shares in connection with the allocation under the Performance Share Program 2024  the allocation of Proact shares shall occur as soon as possible when such obstacle has ceased  and allocation is possible. A.4Terms for share rights The following terms shall apply for share rights: Share rights are allocated free of charge.Participants are not entitled to transfer  pledge  dispose of  or exercise any shareholder rights regarding the share rights.The allocation of Proact shares according to the share rights requires  with certain limited exceptions  that the participant remains employed within the Proact Group throughout the entire Vesting Period and that the participant has not disposed of any of the originally held Investment Shares during the Vesting Period. Furthermore  for the allocation of Proact shares  the achievement of performance targets by Proact in accordance with point A.5 below is required.Proact will compensate the participants if Proact's dividend distributions exceed the upper range according to Proact's dividend policy.The maximum value (including any compensation that the participants receive for dividends paid) that a participant can receive per share right is limited to an amount of SEK 320. If the value of the Proact share  at the time of allocation of shares  exceeds the maximum value  the number of shares to be allocated shall be reduced accordingly. A.5Performance targets The allocation of Proact shares depends on the extent to which three performance targets are met  which are to Proact's earnings per share  return on capital employed and net sales in fiscal year 2026  as well as achieving a threshold value of earnings per share for the fiscal year 2026. The performance targets shall be measured independently and assigned equal weight. The Board has set a minimum and a maximum level for each performance target. In the event that the threshold value for earnings per share is not achieved  the share rights will not entitle to any shares  regardless of the outcome of the performance targets. In order for all share rights to entitle to Proact shares  the maximum level for all performance targets must be achieved. If the minimum levels for a specific performance target is not met  the share rights associated with that performance target do not entitle to Proact shares. In cases where the degree of achievement of the performance targets is between the minimum and maximum levels  the outcome will be determined linearly within the range. Proact intends to present the minimum and maximum levels for the performance targets and to what extent these have been achieved in connection with the expiry of the Performance Share Program 2024. The outcome of the Performance Share Program 2024 will be included in Proact's remuneration report for the annual general meeting 2027. A.6Scope The maximum number of Proact shares that can be allocated under Performance Share Program 2024  shall be limited to 242 000  which corresponds to approximately 0.90 percent of the outstanding shares and votes. The number of shares included in Performance Share Program 2024 may  according to the detailed conditions decided by the Board  be subject to recalculation where Proact carries out a bonus issue  a share split or a reverse share split  a rights issue or similar actions  with regard to customary practice for similar incentive plans. A.7Formulation and administration The Board shall  in accordance with the resolution adopted the general meeting  be responsible for the detailed formulation and administration of the Performance Share Program 2024  within the scope of the terms and guidelines set out herein. If the delivery of Proact shares to individuals outside of Sweden cannot be carried out at reasonable costs and with reasonable administrative efforts  the Board shall have the right to decide that participants outside of Sweden may instead be offered cash-based settlement. The Board may also decide on the introduction of an alternative cash-based incentive program for participants in countries where the acquisition of Investment Shares or the allotment of Proact shares is not possible  or if this would otherwise be deemed appropriate. Such an alternative incentive program shall  to the extent practically possible  be designed to correspond to the terms of the Performance Share Program 2024. The intention is that the Board shall launch the Share Program 2024 as soon practically possible after the annual general meeting. The Board shall  before allotment/transfer of Proact shares  assess whether the allotment is reasonable in relation to the company's financial results  position and development  as well as other factors. If significant changes take place within the company  or on the market  which  by the assessment of the Board  would mean that the terms for allotment/transfer of Proact share according to Performance Share Program 2024 is no longer reasonable  the Board shall have the right to amend Performance Share Program 2024  including  among others  the right to reduce the number of allotted/transferred Proact shares  or not to allot/transfer any Performance Shares at all. In the event the general meeting does not resolve in accordance with item B with the required majority  the company shall hedge against the financial exposure expected to arise from the Performance Share Program 2024 by entering into a share swap agreement with a third party as set out in item C below. (B)Hedging measures by way of transfer of own shares B.1Background In order to implement Performance Share Program 2024 in a cost-efficient and flexible manner  the board proposes that the company's commitments for the delivery of Proact shares are primarily secured through the transfer of Proact shares held by the company. B.2The Board's proposal to resolve on transfer of own shares to the participants The board therefore proposes that the annual general meeting resolves on the transfer of own shares in accordance with the terms set out below: (i) Transfer can be made of no more than 242 000 Proact shares to participants in Performance Share Program 2024 (or a higher number that may result from a recalculation due to Proact implementing a bonus issue  a share split or a reverse share split  a new share issue or similar measures). (ii) The transfer of shares shall be made without payment at the time and in accordance with the terms and conditions that the participants in Performance Share Program 2024 are entitled to receive allocation of shares. The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights is that the transfer of the shares is part of executing Performance Share Program 2024. Therefore  the Board considers it to be to the benefit of Proact to transfer shares in accordance with the proposal. Since the Board considers that the most cost-efficient method is to transfer own Proact- shares  it is proposed that hedging measures regarding Performance Share Program 2024 are carried out as described in this item B. Should the necessary majority not be obtained for the proposal in item B  the Board will enter into a share swap agreement  in accordance with item C below. (C)Hedging via a share swap agreement with a third party C.1Share swap agreement In the event that the necessary majority is not obtained for item B above  the company will hedge itself against the financial exposure that Performance Share Program 2024 is expected to entail  by entering into a share swap agreement with a third party  whereby the third party in its own name shall acquire and transfer Proact shares under Performance Share Program 2024. The relevant number of shares shall correspond to the number of shares proposed under item B above. C.2Costs for the share-swap agreement etc. The Board believes that the most cost efficient and flexible method to transfer Proact shares under Performance Share Program 2024 is obtained through transfer of own shares pursuant to item B above. The cost of hedging by entering into a share-swap agreement with a third party is significantly higher and will be based on an interest base with an addition for the company's lending costs  taking into account the structure of the share swap derivative. (D)Other matters in relation to Performance Share Program 2024 etc. D.1Estimated costs and the value of Performance Share Plan 2024 The cost of the Performance Share Program 2024  assuming 4(i) all individuals offered participation in the program participate  (ii) each participant acquires the maximum number of Investment Shares  (iii) the performance targets are met to 50 percent  (iv) the company has a staff turnover of 10 percent among the participants in the program  (v) the share price increases by 10 percent annually  and (vi) social security contributions amount to 25 percent  the total estimated annual costs amount to approximately SEK 4.0 million  of which SEK 1.1 million represents the cost for social security contributions. Assuming that the performance targets are achieved so that 100 percent of the maximum number of Proact shares are allocated  and otherwise the same assumptions as above  the total annual costs are estimated to SEK 14.7 million  of which SEK 6.5 million represents the costs for social security contributions. The costs will be booked as personnel costs in the income statement over the Vesting Period  in accordance with IFRS 2 share-based payments. Social security contributions will be recognized as an expense in the income statement  according to UFR 7 over the Vesting Period. The size of the social security contributions will be calculated based on the share price development for the company's share during the Vesting Period. D.2Effects on key figures The annual cost estimated above of SEK 4.0 million corresponds  on a pro forma basis for 2023  to a negative effect of approximately 0.08 percentage points on Proact's operating margin and a decrease in earnings per share of approximately SEK 0.12. Nevertheless  the Board considers that the positive effects on the result which are expected to arise from the increase of focus on profitability and sales growth  together with an expanded shareholding in Proact among the CEO  group management  and key personnel  outweigh the costs associated with the program. D.3The Board's explanatory statement The Board wants to implement Performance Share Program 2024 for current and future employees in the company in order to encourage a personal long-term ownership in the company  and in order to increase and strengthen the potential for recruiting  retaining and motivating current and future employees in the company and its subsidiary. Therefore  the Board proposes that the general meeting resolves to implement a Performance Share Program 2024 for current and future employees of the company or its subsidiaries. Performance Share Program 2024 has been designed to reward the participants for increased shareholder value by allotting shares  based on whether the financial targets are achieved. By linking the current and future employees' remuneration to the development of the company's results and value  the long-term value growth of the company is rewarded. Based on these circumstances  the Board considers that the implementation of Performance Share Program 2024 will have a positive effect on the company's continued development  and will therefore be beneficial to the shareholders and the company. D.4Preparation of the item The basis for Performance Share Program 2024 has been prepared by the Board of the company. The work has been supported by external advisors and has been made in consultation with shareholders. The Board has thereafter decided to present this proposal for the general meeting. Except for the staff that have prepared the matter upon instruction from the Board  no employee that may be a participant of Performance Share Program 2024 has participated in the preparations of the program's terms. D.5Other share-related incentive programs The company's share-related incentive programs are described on page 65 in the company's annual report for 2023. D.6Majority requirement The resolution according to item A above shall require a majority of more than half of the votes cast at the annual general meeting. A valid resolution under item B above requires that shareholders representing not less than nine-tenths of the votes cast as well as the shares represented at the annual general meeting approve the resolution. Item 18. Resolution on authorization for the board to resolve on new share issue The board proposes that the annual general meeting authorizes the board to  with or without deviating from the shareholders' preferential right  at one or more occasions  until the date of the next annual general meeting decide on new share issues of a total of no more than 2 800 000 shares. This equals a dilutive effect of app. 10 per cent of equity and votes at full use of the authorization at the time of this notice. It is noted that issues in accordance with the authorization however will be limited so that issued shares together with any repurchased shares according to the authorization proposed under item 19 below amounts to a total of not more than 10 per cent of the at each time outstanding number of shares. Resolution on a new share issue may also include a provision regarding that new shares may be paid through set-off or by non-cash consideration with or without deviating from the shareholders' preferential right. Payment through set-off may however only be made in connection with acquisition of companies. The Board  or the person appointed by the Board  is proposed to be authorized to make the minor adjustments to the decision that may prove necessary in connection with the registration of the decision by Swedish Companies Registration Office. Item 19. Resolution on authorization for the Board of directors to acquire and transfer treasury shares The Board proposes that the annual general meeting authorizes  for the period until end of the next annual general meeting  the Board to resolve on the acquisition and transfer of the Company's treasury shares in accordance with the following. Acquisition of shares in the company may only be made either on Nasdaq Stockholm (the ""Exchange"") or in accordance with an offer to all shareholders of the company. Acquisition may only be made of a maximum number of shares so that the number of treasury shares together with any newly issued shares in accordance with the authorization proposed under item 18  amounts to a total of not more than 10 per cent of the at each time outstanding number of shares and furthermore provided that  after repurchase  there is still full coverage of the company's restricted equity. Transfer of shares in the company may be carried out with a right to transfer deviating from the shareholders' preferential rights and it should be possible to make a payment by means of noncash consideration  i.e. through contribution in kind or set-off. Payment through set-off may however only be made in connection with acquisition of a company. Transfer may be made of the entire number of shares which the company at each time holds. Transfer may not be made on the Exchange. Item 20. Resolution on reduction of the share capital (cancellation) and bonus issue The Board proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to reduce the share capital (cancellation) and to increase of share capital by way of bonus issue. The proposal is divided into two parts: A) Resolution on the reduction of the share capital B) Resolution on a bonus issue to increase the share capital. The Board proposes that a resolution in accordance with items A and B are conditional upon each other  which is why the proposals shall be adopted as a joint resolution. A valid decision requires the support of shareholders representing at least two-thirds of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the meeting. (A)Resolution on reduction of the share capital (cancellation) The company holds 1 009 452 of its own shares. The Board proposes that the annual general meeting decides to reduce the company's share capital by SEK 227 533 by the cancellation of 600 000 shares that the company has repurchased based on previous repurchase authorizations. The purpose of the reduction is to allocate to unrestricted equity. The cancellation means that the company's share capital decreases from SEK 10 618 837 to SEK 10 391 304 and that the number of shares decreases from 28 001 658 shares to 27 401 658 shares. The resolution is conditional upon the annual general meeting resolving on an increase of the share capital by way of a bonus issue in accordance with item B below  and that the reduction of the share capital and bonus issue combined does not entail in a decrease of the company's share capital. The Board  or a person appointed by the board  is authorized to make such minor adjustments to the above resolutions as may be required to file the resolutions with the Swedish Companies Registration Office. (B)Resolution on an increase of the share capital The Board proposed that the annual general meeting resolves to increase the company's share capital by SEK 227 533 by way of bonus issue without issuing new shares  by transferring SEK 227 533 from the unrestricted equity to the company's share capital. The purpose of the bonus issue is to restore the share capital after the reduction of the share capital in accordance with item A above. The resolution is conditional upon the annual general meeting resolving on the reduction of the share capital in accordance with item A above and that the reduction of the share capital and bonus issue does not entail in a decrease of the company's share capital. The Board  or a person appointed by the board  is authorized to make such minor adjustments as may be required to file the resolutions with the Swedish Companies Registration Office The resolution of the two parts (A and B) will result in an increase of the quota value of a Proact share to SEK 0.388 (0.379). Documentation and further information Accounting documents and audit report  the board's remuneration report  the nomination committee's proposals and reasoned opinion and other necessary documentation will be kept available at the company at the address Frösundaviks Allé 1  Solna at the latest from 16 April 2024.

FrenkelChair of the BoardHila Barak Registered Ofﬁce: Company Secretary Matam  Building 10.2 Haifa 3115001 29 March 2024 Israel Registered in Israel number 514142140 4Explanatory Notes: Resolutions 1-5. Nomination for re-electionAt the AGM  ﬁve (5) currently serving directors are proposed to be re-elected. Each of the re-elected directors will hold ofﬁce until the next annual general meeting  unless any ofﬁce is earlier vacated under any relevant provisions of the Articles or applicable laws or regulations.Provision 18 of the UK Corporate Governance Code 2018 issued by the Financial Reporting Council (the ""Code"") recommends that all directors should be put forward for annual re-election by shareholders. The External Directors  Tami Gottlieb and Daniel King (who will join the Board in June 2024) are subject to mandatory three-year terms under the Israeli Companies Law  5759-1999 (the ""Companies Law"") and are therefore not put forward for re-election at the AGM. Except for Ms. Anne Grim  who was appointed for a one-year term at the Company's Extraordinary General Meeting held on 8 January 2024  and therefore is not required to stand for re-election at this AGM  all other current Directors (Excluding the two External Directors)  submit themselves for re-election.Each of the nominees has indicated to the Company his/her availability for re-election and has declared that he/she has the required qualiﬁcations and ability to devote the time required for his/her service as a director with respect to the Company's special needs and its size and speciﬁed the said qualiﬁcations. Additionally  each of the Non-Executive nominees has declared that the limitations speciﬁed in sections 225 through 227 of the Companies Law do not apply to such nominee  all pursuant to section 224B of the Companies Law. Such declarations can be found in the Company's ofﬁces.Biographical details for the Directors subject to re-election are provided on pages 58 to 61 of the Company's Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2023.The Company considers that given the skills  experience  expertise and contribution of each of the Board members proposed for re-election  their re-election is important to the Company's long-term sustainable success and therefore it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders as a whole.RemunerationSteve Baldwin and Prof. Varda Liberman  the Independent Non-Executive Directors (who are not External Directors)  if re-elected  will continue to be entitled to remuneration in the amount of USD 130 000 (plus VAT  as applicable) gross per annum.Prof. Jacob A. Frenkel  as an Independent Non-Executive Director and Chair of the Board  if re-elected  will continue to be entitled to remuneration in the amount of USD 595 000 (plus VAT) gross per annum  with the split of cash and shares remaining in line with the structure of his current remuneration  as follows: (a) USD 470 000 (plus VAT) in cash and (b) USD 125 000 (plus VAT) by the allotment of ordinary shares of the Company. In addition  if re-elected  Prof. Frenkel will continue to be entitled to an additional allotment of shares of USD 145 000 (plus VAT). There are no performance-related elements attached to the share element of the remuneration. The expectation is that Prof. Frenkel will retain and build  whilst Chair of the Board  his shareholding in the Company. An amount equal to the applicable tax liability for the allotted ordinary shares shall be added by way of gross-up and be paid in cash to fund the tax liability.David Zruia and Elad Even Chen  the Executive Directors  will not be entitled to additional remuneration for serving as Directors in addition to their remuneration as executives of the Company.The proposed nominees for re-election  if re-elected  will continue to beneﬁt from coverage under the Company's directors' and ofﬁcers' liability insurance policies and from the letters of exculpation and indemniﬁcation provided to them by the Company.Resolution 6. This resolution proposes to re-appoint Kesselman & Kesselman  a member ﬁrm of PricewaterhouseCoopers International Limited  as the Company's independent external auditor for 2024 and until the next annual general meeting of shareholders  and to authorise the Company's Board of Directors (with power of delegation to its audit committee) to ﬁx the remuneration to be paid to such auditors.Under the Companies Law and the Articles  the Company's shareholders are authorised to appoint the Company's independent auditors. The Articles further provide that the Board of Directors is authorised to determine the independent auditor's remuneration.The Audit Committee as well as the Board of Directors review and assess on an annual basis  the performance of the external auditors  their independence and the reasonableness of their audit fees as compared with peer tier 1 accountancy ofﬁces in Israel and make recommendations to be brought forward to the shareholders' meeting as to the appointment  or re-appointment  or replacement of the external auditors of the Company.Following the recommendation by the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors  it is proposed that Kesselman & Kesselman  a member ﬁrm of PricewaterhouseCoopers International Limited  be re-appointed as the independent auditors of the Company for the period ending at the close of the next annual general meeting. Such auditors served as the Company's auditors for ﬁscal year 2023 and have no relationship with the Company or with any afﬁliate of the Company  except as described in the 2023 Annual Report.The following table provides details of the audit fees and non-audit fees paid by the Company and its subsidiaries to Kesselman & Kesselman  a member ﬁrm of PricewaterhouseCoopers International Limited  and to other local ofﬁces of PricewaterhouseCoopers  for each of the years ended 31 December 2023 and 2022:Year ended 31 DecemberUS dollars in millions 2023 2022 Audit of Plus500 Ltd.'s consolidated ﬁnancial statements 0.3 0.3 Audit of Plus500 Ltd.'s subsidiaries 0.6 0.3 Total audit fees 0.9 0.6 Other assurance related services 0.2 0.3 Tax compliance services 0.1 0.5 Total non-audit fees 0.3 0.8 Total fees 1.2 1.4Resolution 7. Under Article 10 of the Articles  if the Directors wish to allot any shares or grant rights over shares (other than pursuant to an employee share scheme)  they must in the ﬁrst instance offer them to existing shareholders in proportion to their holdings. There may be occasions  however  when the Directors need the ﬂexibility to ﬁnance business opportunities by the issue of shares for cash without a pre-emptive offer to existing shareholders. This cannot be done under the Articles unless the shareholders have ﬁrst waived their pre-emption rights. Resolution 7 asks shareholders to do this  and provides for non-pre-emptive allotments up to 3 911 730 ordinary shares  representing approximately 5 per cent of the Company's issued ordinary share capital (excluding shares held in treasury) as at 28 March 2024 (being the latest practicable date prior to publication of this notice) until 5 August 2025 or  if earlier  the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting of the Company.Resolution 8. This resolution will enable the Directors  in appropriate circumstances  to issue for cash  without a pre-emptive offer to existing ordinary shareholders under Article 10 of the Articles  equity securities up to 3 911 730 ordinary shares  representing approximately 5 per cent of the Company's issued ordinary share capital (excluding shares held in treasury) as at 28 March 2024 (being the latest practicable date prior to publication of this notice). This is to be used only for the purposes of ﬁnancing (or reﬁnancing  if the power is to be used within six months after the original transaction) a transaction which the Board determines to be an acquisition or other capital investment of a kind contemplated by the Pre-Emption Group's Statement of Principles published in 2015 (the ""Pre-Emption Principles"").The Directors conﬁrm that  in accordance with the Pre-Emption Principles  it does not intend to issue more than 7.5 per cent of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company for cash on a non-pre-emptive basis in any rolling three-year period (other than as set out in the Pre-emption Group's statement of Principles) without prior consultation with shareholders.Resolution 9. For UK incorporated companies  there are requirements in relation to the content and approval of the directors' remuneration report. As an Israeli incorporated company  Plus500 is not subject to these requirements but the Board considers that shareholders would expect the Company to voluntarily mirror the requirements of UK legislation applicable to a premium listed main market company so far as is practicable. The Board is happy to do so as the Directors consider that the requirements facilitate good corporate governance and therefore the 2023 Directors' Remuneration Report will be put to an advisory shareholder vote by ordinary resolution. Whilst this does not impact the legal approval of remuneration in Israel  the outcome of the vote will be taken under advisement by the Board.Resolution 10. This resolution seeks authority for the Company to make purchases of its own ordinary shares. If passed  the resolution gives authority for the Company to purchase up to 7 823 460 ordinary shares  representing approximately 10 per cent of the Company's issued ordinary share capital (excluding shares held in treasury) as at 28 March 2024 (being the latest practicable date prior to publication of this notice) until 5 August 2025 or  if earlier  the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting of the Company.The purpose of this resolution is to provide the Company with the ﬂexibility to manage its capital effectively and as a mechanism for returning cash to shareholders. The Company currently has a buyback programme in place. Ordinary shares that are being purchased as part of the Company's buyback programme are held in treasury.During 2023 the Company repurchased an aggregate of 14 859 392 ordinary shares for an aggregate purchase price of USD 275.3 million  with an average purchase price of £14.82 per share.From 1 January 2024 through 28 March 2024 (being the latest practicable date prior to publication of this notice)  the Company repurchased an aggregate of 1 483 445 ordinary shares for an aggregate purchase amount of USD 33.3 million  with an average purchase price of £17.66 per share.Notes:1.

Your nominee will need to have completed a letter of representation and presented this to Link Group  our registrar  no later than 1 May 2024.7. Pursuant to the Companies Law  to be entitled to attend and to vote at the Annual General Meeting (and for the purpose of the determination by the Company of the votes they may cast)  shareholders must be registered in the register of the Company at close of business on 9 April 2024. Changes to the Company's register after the relevant deadline shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend and vote at the Annual General Meeting.8. For any Company's applicable equity schemes  the number of ordinary shares allotted on the vesting date shall be calculated based on the ordinary share price at grant date per each plan  as adjusted for total shareholder returns  up to the allotment date. An amount equal to the applicable tax liability connected to the equity share based compensation plans  shall be added by way of gross-up and be paid in cash to fund the tax liability. The allotted ordinary shares will be transferred out of the treasury shares of the Company. Additionally  as may be applicable  total shareholder returns to be paid in cash in respect of the vested equity programmes shall be added by way of gross-up and be paid in cash to fund the tax liability. The fair value of the ordinary shares at the grant date per each plan  takes into consideration the most probable value of the shares including the expected value of total shareholder returns during the vesting period.9. The quorum for the Annual General Meeting shall be two or more shareholders present either in person  or by proxy and holding shares conferring in the aggregate 25 per cent of the voting power of the Company. If within half an hour from the time appointed for the meeting a quorum is not present  the meeting shall be adjourned to the same day in the next week  at the same time  or to such day and at such time as the Chair may determine. No business shall be transacted at any adjourned meeting except business which might lawfully have been transacted at the meeting as originally called. If a quorum as referred to in above is not present at the second meeting within half an hour from the time appointed for the adjourned meeting  the quorum shall be reduced to one or more shareholders present in person or by proxy holding shares conferring any voting power of the Company.10. Any shareholder attending the Annual General Meeting is entitled pursuant to the Companies Law to ask any question before (by emailingir@plus500.com)  or during the meeting  relating to the business being dealt with at the meeting. The Company will answer any such questions unless (i) to do so would interfere unduly with the preparation for the meeting or involve the disclosure of conﬁdential information; or (ii) the answer has already been given on a website in the form of any answer to a question; or (iii) it is undesirable in the interests of the Company or the good order of the meeting that the question be answered.11. As at 28 March 2024 (being the last practicable date prior to any publication of this Notice)  the Company's issued share capital consisted of 114 888 377 ordinary shares carrying one vote each (including 36 653 782 ordinary shares held by the Company in treasury which do not carry any voting rights). The total voting rights in the Company as at 28 March 2024 were  therefore  78 234 595.12. The Board recommends that shareholders vote in favour of all items in the Notice.13. In the case of Depositary Interest Holders  CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so by using the procedures described in the CREST Manual. CREST Personal Members or other CREST sponsored members  and those CREST members who have appointed a service provider  should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider  who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf.14. In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the CREST service to be valid  the appropriate CREST message (a ""CREST Proxy Instruction"") must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK & International Limited's speciﬁcations and must contain the information required for such instruction  as described in the CREST Manual (available viawww.euroclear.com). The message  regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or is an amendment to an instruction given to a previously appointed proxy  must  in order to be valid  be transmitted so as to be received by the issuer's agent ID (RA10) by 09:00 a.m. (UK time) on 1 May 2024. For this purpose  the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST Application Host) from which the issuer's agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. After this time  any change of instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should be communicated to the appointee through other means.15. CREST members and  where applicable  their CREST sponsors or voting service providers should note that Euroclear UK & International Limited does not make available special procedures in CREST for any particular message. Normal system timings and limitations will  therefore  apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or  if the CREST member is a CREST personal member  or sponsored member  or has appointed a voting service provider)  to procure that his CREST sponsor or voting service provider takes) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection  CREST members and  where applicable  their CREST sponsors or voting system providers are referred  in particular  to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings.16. The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in regulation 35(5)(a) of the Uncertiﬁcated Securities Regulations 2001.17. Copies of the service contracts of the Executive Directors and the letters of appointment (and other related documents) of theNon-Executive Directors  which are available for inspection during normal business hours at the registered ofﬁce of the Company and at the ofﬁces of Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner LLP  Governor's House  5 Laurence Pountney Hill  London EC4R 0BR  on any weekday (Saturdays  Sundays and public holidays excluded)  will also be available for inspection at the place of the AGM for at least 15 minutes prior to and during the AGM.18.

Shareholders who are unable to attend the AGM in person are invited to join a webinar of the proceedings  details of how to access this will be available on the Company's website:www.vesuvius.com  on the day of the meeting.Shareholders' views are important to us and we consider the AGM to be an important event in our calendar and an opportunity to engage with our Shareholders.

In September 2023  we welcomed Robert MacLeod to the Board. Robert is a Qualiﬁed Chartered Accountant  with signiﬁcant experience in large multinational companies.He is a highly knowledgeable corporate and operational ﬁnance professional with a wealth of general management and ﬁnancial leadership experience  and has already made a signiﬁcant contribution to the Board.In February 2024  we were pleased to announce that  subject to shareholders approving her appointment at the AGM  Eva Lindqvist will join the Board. Eva is an engineer with more than 35 years' experience in global industrial and service businesses  and I know she will be a valuable addition to the Board. Having reviewed her other commitments the Board believes that she will be able to devote the necessary amount of time to the Company's business. Eva has been appointed on the same terms as the other Non-executive Directors  details of which can be found in the Annual Report. As at 20 March 2024  she did not hold any interests in the ordinary shares of the Company.Douglas Hurt reaches the ninth anniversary of his appointment to the Board in April 2024 and he will therefore step down at the conclusion of the AGM. On behalf of the Board I would like to thank Douglas for his dedicated service  wise counsel and exceptional support over the years  both as Senior Independent Director and Chairman of the Audit Committee. It is proposed that Robert succeeds Douglas as Chair of the Audit Committee and Eva succeeds him as Senior Independent Director  at the conclusion of the AGM.In line with the Company's Articles of Association and the UK Corporate Governance Code (the ""Code"")  all the Directors with the exception of Douglas Hurt  will therefore retire at the AGM  and will seek election or re-election by the shareholders. Biographical details of all of the Directors are given on pages 8 and 9  itemising the speciﬁc skills and contribution of each Director to the Company's long-term success.During 2023 the Board again conducted a formal and rigorous evaluation of the Board's performance and eﬀectiveness. The evaluation was externally facilitated by the corporate advisory ﬁrm Lintstock Ltd  and included an evaluation of the performance of the Board  the Board's Committees and the individual performance of each Board member. This process enabled the Board to reﬂect on its role supporting the business in the achievement of its strategic and operational objectives. Overall  the Board was felt to be well-composed with a good range of skills and experience  covering a mixture of diﬀerent industrial sectors  functional expertise and geographies. The evaluation highlighted a number of ongoing Board priorities  which the Board will be progressing in 2024.The Board also reviewed the time given by each of the Non-executive Directors to performing their duties on behalf of the Company  and concluded that each of the Directors devotes the necessary amount of time to the Company's business.As Chairman  I believe that the contribution and performance of each of the Directors remains valuable and relevant  and they continue to discharge their roles and responsibilities eﬀectively. They all demonstrate commitment to the Company and it is appropriate that all Directors standing for election or re-election should continue to serve on the Board.AuditorPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (""PwC"") was appointed as the Company's external auditor in 2017. During 2023  the Audit Committee conducted a formal assessment of PwC's performance  and concluded that PwC had provided an eﬀective and objective audit process for the 2022 ﬁnancial year  exhibiting strong technical expertise and appropriate challenge. The Audit Committee also conﬁrmed that it considered that PwC was appropriately independent and objective  and therefore recommended to the Board that PwC be reappointed for 2024. In making this recommendation the Audit Committee conﬁrmed that its decision was free from the inﬂuence of any third party and that there were no contractual restrictions on the choice of auditor. A resolution for the reappointment of PwC is therefore being proposed at this AGM.Directors' authority to allot shares other than on a pre-emptive basisIf the Directors wish to allot Shares in certain circumstances  these Shares must be oﬀered ﬁrst to Shareholders in proportion to their existing holdings (a pre-emptive basis). This requirement can be modiﬁed or disapplied to give the Directors greater ﬂexibility in raising capital for the Company. The Board considers it appropriate for the Company to seek approval from Shareholders to waive these rights in certain circumstances  in order to allow the Company greater ﬂexibility to react to future business needs without the need to comply with the strict requirements of the statutory pre-emption provisions.The Pre-Emption Group updated their guidance around the disapplication of pre-emptive rights in November 2022. The changes aimed to help UK-listed companies to raise equity capital more quickly and eﬃciently  without making a full public oﬀer to all shareholders. Our resolutions were updated at the AGM in 2023 to reﬂect the revised Pre-Emption Group guidance and we will request updated authorities from shareholders in respect of non pre-emptive oﬀers at the AGM. The details of this proposal can be found in Resolutions 17 and 18 and the Explanatory Notes on pages 10 and 11.Purchase of Own SharesIn accordance with the authority granted by shareholders at the 2023 AGM  the Company announced a Share Buyback Programme on4 December 2023. Since the commencement of the Share Buyback Programme to repurchase up to £50 million of ordinary shares  up to the date of this Notice  the Company has purchased 3 223 149 ordinary shares for a consideration of £15 333 388. All purchased shares have been  or will shortly be  cancelled. It is our intention to renew the purchase of own shares authority at the AGM.Shareholder InformationShareholder information is available to view online on our website at:www.vesuvius.com/en/investors.htmlincluding a webcast of the presentation given by the Chief Executive on the Company's 2023 Financial Results.

Shareholders (or their proxies) are entitled to attend and vote at general meetings of the Company. On a vote by a ""show of hands"" every Shareholder or eﬀectively appointed proxy who is present shall have one vote. On a poll vote every Shareholder who is present in person or by proxy shall have one vote for every Ordinary Share of which he/she is the holder.2. A Shareholder entitled to attend and vote at the AGM may appoint another person as his/her proxy to exercise all or any of his/her rights to attend and speak and vote at the AGM. A Shareholder may appoint more than one proxy in relation to the AGM provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached to a diﬀerent Share or Shares held by that Shareholder. Proxies need not be Shareholders of the Company.3. The appointment of a proxy must be in writing in any usual or common form or in any other form which the Directors may approve and (i) in the case of an individual must either be signed by the appointor or his/her attorney; and (ii) in the case of a corporation must be either given under its common seal or be signed on its behalf by an attorney or a duly authorised oﬃcer of the corporation. Any signature on or authentication of such appointment need not be witnessed. Where an appointment of a proxy is signed on behalf of the appointor by an attorney  the power of attorney or a copy thereof certiﬁed notarially or in some other way approved by the Directors must (failing previous registration with the Company) be submitted to the Company's Registrar as detailed in Note 5(a)  failing which the appointment may be treated as invalid.4. A Form of Proxy is enclosed with this Notice. The appointment of a proxy does not of itself preclude a Shareholder from attending the AGM and voting in person.5. To be eﬀective  the instrument appointing a proxy  and any power of attorney or other authority under which it is executed (or a duly certiﬁed copy of any such power or authority)  must either be (a) sent to the Company's Registrar  Equiniti Limited  of Aspect House  Spencer Road  Lancing  West Sussex  BN99 6DA or (b) submitted as an electronic proxy instruction through www. sharevote.co.uk - see Note 6 below or (c) lodged using the CREST Proxy Voting Service - see Note 10 below or (d) lodged using the Proxymity platform - see Note 14 opposite - in each case so as to arrive no later than 11.00am on Monday 13 May 2024 or  if the AGM is adjourned  48 hours before the time ﬁxed for the adjourned AGM.6. As an alternative to completing a paper copy Form of Proxy  a Shareholder can appoint a proxy electronically by submitting a proxy instruction throughwww.sharevote.co.uk. For security purposes  you will need to provide your voting ID  task ID and Shareholder Reference Number (SRN) (which are shown on the Form of Proxy). Full instructions are given on the sharevote website.7. If you return both paper and electronic proxy instructions  those received last by the Registrar before the latest time for receipt of proxies will take precedence. You are advised to read the sharevote website's terms and conditions of use carefully. Electronic communication facilities are available to all shareholders and those who use them will not be disadvantaged.8. The right to appoint a proxy does not apply to persons whose Shares are held on their behalf by another person and who have been nominated to receive communications from the Company in accordance with Section 146 of the Companies Act (""Nominated Persons""). Nominated Persons may have a right under an agreement with the Shareholder on whose behalf they hold the Shares to be appointed (or to have someone else appointed) as a proxy. Alternatively  if Nominated Persons do not have such a right  or do not wish to exercise it  they may have a right under such an agreement to give instructions to the person holding the Shares as to the exercise of voting rights.9. Entitlement to attend and vote at the AGM  and the number of votes which may be cast at the AGM  will be determined by reference to the number of Shares registered in the Shareholder's name as at 6.30pm on Monday 13 May 2024 or  if the Meeting is adjourned  at 6.30pm on the day two days before the day ﬁxed for the adjourned meeting (as the case may be). In each case  changes to the register of Shareholders after such time will be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend and vote at the AGM.10. CREST Shareholders who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so for the AGM to be held on Wednesday 15 May 2024 and any adjournment(s) thereof by using the procedures described in the CREST Manual which can be viewed atwww.euroclear.com. CREST personal Shareholders or other CREST sponsored Shareholders  and those CREST Shareholders who have appointed a voting service provider(s)  should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s)  who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf.11. In order for the appointment of a proxy or instruction made by means of CREST to be valid  the appropriate CREST message (a ""CREST Proxy Instruction"") must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear's speciﬁcations and must contain the information required for such instructions  as described in the CREST Manual. The message (regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy  the revocation in appointment of a proxy or an amendment to the instruction given to a previously appointed proxy) must  in order to be valid  be transmitted so as to be received by the issuer's agent (ID RA19) by the latest time(s) for receipt of appointments of proxy speciﬁed in Note 5 above. For this purpose  the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST Applications Host) from which the issuer's agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. After this time any change of instructions to a proxy appointed through CREST should be communicated to the appointed proxy by other means.12. CREST Shareholders (and  where applicable  their CREST sponsors or voting service providers) should note that Euroclear does not make available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings and limitations will therefore apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST Shareholder concerned to take (or  if the CREST Shareholder is a CREST personal Shareholder or sponsored Shareholder or has appointed a voting service provider  to procure that his/her CREST sponsor or voting service provider takes) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection  CREST Shareholders (and  where applicable  their CREST sponsors or voting service providers) are referred  in particular  to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings.13. The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the UncertiﬁcatedSecurities Regulations 2001.14. If you are an institutional investor you may be able to appoint a proxy electronically via the Proxymity platform  a process which has been agreed by the Company and approved by the Registrar. For further information regarding Proxymity  please go towww.proxymity.io. Your proxy instruction must be lodged by 11.00am on Monday 13 May 2024 in order to be considered valid. Before you can appoint a proxy via this process you will need to have agreed to Proxymity's associated terms and conditions. It is important that you read these carefully as you will be bound by them and they will govern the electronic appointment of your proxy. Corporate representatives15. Any corporation which is a Shareholder can appoint one or more corporate representatives who may exercise on its behalf all of the same powers as the corporation could exercise if it were an individual Shareholder provided that they do not do so in relation to the same Shares.

The Companies Act requires companies to obtain Shareholders' authority for donations to registered political parties  other political organisations and independent election candidates totalling more than £5 000 in any 12-month period  and for any political expenditure  subject to limited exceptions. The deﬁnitions of ""donations""  ""political organisations""  ""independent election candidates"" and ""political expenditure"" are very wide in this context and there is concern that they may have had the eﬀect of covering a number of normal business activities that would not be thought to be political donations in the usual sense.As required by the Companies Act  the resolution is in general terms and does not purport to authorise particular donations. It remains the policy of the Company not to make political donations or incur political expenditure as those expressions are normally understood. However  to avoid inadvertent infringement of the Companies Act  the Directors are seeking Shareholders' authority for the Company and its subsidiaries to make political donations and to incur political expenditure during the period from the passing of the resolution until the conclusion of the Company's next AGM or the close of business on 30 June 2025  whichever is the earlier  up to a maximum aggregate amount of £100 000.Directors' authority to allot shares (Resolution 16)Under the Companies Act the Directors may only allot unissued Shares if authorised to do so by the Shareholders in general meeting. At the Annual General Meeting held on 18 May 2023  Shareholders granted the Directors authority to allot Shares and grant rights under Section 551 of the Companies Act. Resolution 16 seeks to renew the authority to:(a) allow the Directors to allot Shares or grant rights to subscribe for or convert any security into Shares up to an aggregate nominal amount of £8 936 461 representing an amount equal to one-third of the Company's issued share capital  excluding Treasury Shares  as at 20 March 2024; and(b)to allow the Directors to allot new Shares or grant rights to subscribe for or convert any security into Shares only in connection with a rights issue up to a further nominal value of £8 936 461 representing an amount equal to one-third of the Company's issued share capital  excluding Treasury Shares  as at 20 March 2024.If this resolution is passed  the Directors will have the authority in certain circumstances to allot new Shares and grant rights up to a total nominal value of £17 872 922 representing a total amount equal to two-thirds of the Company's issued share capital  excluding Treasury Shares  as at 20 March 2024.The authority being sought complies with the Share Capital Management Guidelines issued by the Investment Association in February 2023  (the ""IA Share Capital Guidelines""). The Company has no present intention of undertaking a rights issue  or of allotting new Shares other than in connection with any outstanding share option awards or allocations under the Vesuvius Share Plan. The Directors consider it desirable to have the maximum ﬂexibility permitted by corporate governance guidelines to respond to market developments and to enable allotments to take place.As at 20 March 2024  the Company held 7 271 174 Treasury Shares which represent 2.64% of the total number of Ordinary Shares in issue at that date.The authorities granted in Resolution 16 will expire on the date of the Company's next AGM or at the close of business on 30 June 2025  whichever is the earlier.Special ResolutionsDirectors' authority to allot shares other than on a pre-emptive basis (Resolutions 17 and 18)If equity securities are to be allotted  or Treasury Shares sold  for cash using the authority given by Resolution 16 explained above  Section 561(1) of the Companies Act requires that those securities be oﬀered ﬁrst to existing Shareholders in proportion to their existing holdings. The Board considers it appropriate for the Company to seek approval from Shareholders to waive these rights in certain circumstances  in order to allow the Company maximum ﬂexibility to react to future business needs without the need to comply with the strict requirements of the statutory pre-emption provisions.The authorities being sought in Resolutions 17 and 18  are in line with the IA Share Capital Guidelines and the Pre-Emption Group's Statement of Principles (the ""Pre-Emption Principles"") as revised in November 2022. The Resolutions are proposed in accordance with the template resolutions published by the UK Pre-Emption Group in November 2022.Pre-emptive oﬀersResolution 17 (limb (i)) is a special resolution which renews and extends the Directors' authority  granted by the Shareholders at the AGM held on 18 May 2023  to allot equity securities  and/or sell Treasury Shares  for cash in connection with a rights issue or other pre-emptive oﬀer without ﬁrst being required to oﬀer such Shares to existing Shareholders in proportion to their existing holdings.This is to allow the Directors to make exclusions or such other arrangements as may be appropriate to resolve legal or practical problems  for example issues arising as a result of local legal or regulatory requirements in respect of overseas Shareholders' participation in a rights issue.Non-pre-emptive oﬀers - general use authorityResolution 17 (limb (ii)) is a special resolution which renews and extends the Directors' authority  granted by the Shareholders at the AGM held on 18 May 2023  to allot equity securities  and/or sell Treasury Shares  for cash in any case other than in connection with a rights issue or other pre-emptive oﬀer up to an aggregate nominal value of £2 680 938 representing approximately 10 per cent of the Company's issued share capital excluding Treasury Shares as at 20 March 2024  without ﬁrst being required to oﬀer such Shares to existing Shareholders in proportion to their existing holdings.",neutral,0.02,0.96,0.01,positive,0.71,0.27,0.02,True,English,"['Annual General Meeting', 'Vesuvius', 'Notice', 'April', '08:06', 'dividend conﬁrmation voucher', 'CREST electronic appointment service', 'The Annual General Meeting', 'Vesuvius plc Ordinary Shares', 'Vesuvius plc annual report', 'share certiﬁcate', 'other professional adviser', 'other independent adviser', 'One Silk Street', 'London EC2Y 8HQ', '2024 Annual General Meeting', 'Shareholder Reference Numbers', 'London EC4A 2AE', ""Vesuvius' Annual Report"", 'CREST Members', 'other agent', '165 Fleet Street', 'white PLC', 'Dear Shareholder', 'The AGM', 'immediate attention', 'Financial Services', 'Markets Act', 'oﬃces', 'Linklaters LLP', 'Monday 13 May', 'Voting ID', 'Task ID', 'Proxymity platform', 'printed copy', 'notiﬁcation', 'fellow Directors', 'voting decision', 'full name', 'Shareholder votes', 'Company number', 'Wednesday 15 May', 'bank manager', 'Further details', 'important event', 'full details', 'accompanying Form', 'paid Form', 'proxy appointments', 'proxy vote', 'Company Secretary', 'formal Notice', ""Shareholders' views"", 'Vesuvius website', ""Vesuvius' AGM"", 'AGM.', 'document', 'doubt', 'aspect', 'proposals', 'action', 'stockbroker', 'solicitor', 'accountant', 'purchaser', 'transferee', 'sale', 'transmission', 'person', 'webinar', 'proceedings', '11.00am', 'map', 'page', 'location', 'venue', 'black', 'future', 'explanation', 'business', 'reply', 'time', 'sharevote', 'Arrangements', 'proxies', 'Notes', 'England', 'Wales', 'March', 'accounts', 'year', 'letter', 'calendar', 'opportunity', 'questions', 'advance', 'mail', 'purpose', '30 April', 'answers', 'investors/shareholder-information', 'shareholder--meetings', 'deadline', 'informed', 'results', 'recording', 'period', '30 days', 'resolutions']",2024-04-02,2024-04-03,marketscreener.com

The resolution items (A) and (B) are mutually conditioned by each other and are resolved upon as one resolution.A. Introduction of LTIP 2024The Board of Directors of the Company proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to adopt a long-term incentive programme in the form of a performance-based share savings programme directed to the Hexatronic Group’s CEO and the management team  other senior executives and other key employees employed in Sweden (“Participants”). LTIP 2024 is proposed to include a maximum of forty-five (45) Participants. Participants in LTIP 2024 must have contributed a private investment through the acquisition of shares in the Company (“Saving Shares”). Subsequently  after a three-year vesting period commencing on the date of entering into an agreement to participate in LTIP 2024 (the “Vesting Period”)  Participants will be given the opportunity to receive ordinary shares free of charge (“Performance Shares”)  subject to the main terms and conditions set forth below. Within the LTIP 2024  the Company will award Participants conditional share rights (“Share Rights”)  meaning the right  subject to certain conditions being met  to receive up to six (6) Performance Shares per Share Right free of charge.BackgroundThe Company’s Board of Directors is of the opinion that a performance-based share savings programme contributes to higher motivation and commitment among employees and strengthens the bonds between the employees and the Company. Furthermore  it is the Board’s assessment that LTIP 2024 will contribute to the opportunities to recruit and retain knowledgeable and experienced employees who hold key positions in the Hexatronic Group and are expected to increase employee interest in the business and earnings development in the Company. LTIP 2024 has been designed on the basis that it is desirable that the CEO and the management team  other senior executives and other key employees within the Hexatronic Group are shareholders in the Company and LTIP 2024 rewards the continued loyalty of employees and thereby the long-term value growth in the Company. All in all  it is the Board’s assessment that LTIP 2024 will benefit both the employees and the Company’s shareholders through an increased share value.Private investmentIn order to participate in LTIP 2024  the Participant must have contributed with a private investment through the acquisition of Saving Shares. The shares shall have been acquired at market prices during the period between 13 May 2024 and 31 May 2024 for the purpose of being allocated to LTIP 2024  unless the Board of Directors allows exceptions in the individual case regarding shares previously acquired. The Board of Directors also has the right to thereafter  for individual additional Participants (new employees or promoted)  postpone the last day for the acquisition of Savings Shares (see more below under “Additional participants”).The maximum number of Saving Shares that a Participant can allocate to LTIP 2024 amounts to a rounded number of shares corresponding to a maximum of ten (10) per cent of the Participant’s annual gross basic salary calculated on the basis of the 2024 salary level and depending on the position in the Hexatronic Group. The minimum number of Saving Shares that a Participant must acquire to participate in LTIP 2024 shall correspond to a market value of at least five (5) per cent of the annual gross basic salary. For each Saving Share held within the LTIP 2024  the Company will grant Participants a Share Right  meaning the right  subject to certain conditions being met  to receive up to two  four or six Performance Shares per Share Right free of charge  depending on the position in the Hexatronic Group.Terms and conditionsIn addition to the requirement that the Participant’s employment and holding of Saving Shares shall continue throughout the Vesting Period  certain performance-based conditions linked to diluted earnings per share  Hexatronic Group growth  EBITA and certain sustainability targets are imposed for the allotment of Performance Shares to the Participants.The Participants are divided into three categories and LTIP 2024 will involve the allocation of the maximum number of Performance Shares per Saving Share as follows:Position Maximum number of Performance Shares per Saving Share CEO and the management team (a total of approximately 10 persons) 6 Other senior executives (a total of approximately 25 persons) 4 Other key employees (a total of approximately 10 persons) 2Allotment  free of charge  of Performance Shares is  in addition to what is stated in the paragraph above  conditional on the achievement of the performance targets set by the Board of Directors. For maximum allotment of Performance Shares  it is required that the targets set by the Board of Directors are achieved or exceeded. The performance targets refer to (i) diluted earnings per share for the respective financial year 2024-2026 (the “Share Target”)  (ii) net sales growth for the respective financial year 2024-2026 (the “Growth Target”)  (iii) EBITA for the respective financial year 2024-2026 (the “EBITA Target”)  and (iv) certain sustainability targets (the “Sustainability Target”) (collectively  the “Performance Targets”)  whereby the Share Target shall be weighted by forty (40) per cent  the Growth Target and EBITA Target shall be weighted by twenty-five (25) per cent each  and the Sustainability Target shall be weighted by ten (10) per cent.If the minimum level is not reached  no Performance Shares related to the current Performance Target for the financial year will be vested and if the upper target level is reached  all Performance Shares arising from the current Performance Target for the financial year will be earned. In the event of an outcome between the minimum level and the upper target level  the earnings of the Performance Shares arising from the current Performance Target for the financial year will be made linearly. The final number of Performance Shares earned by each Participant shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number.For the purpose of giving the Board of Directors the possibility to limit the costs incurred by the Company under LTIP 2024  it is proposed that the Board of Directors upon allotment of Performance Shares shall be entitled to adjust the number of Performance Shares that each individual Participant otherwise would be entitled to.Such adjustment of the number of Performance Shares can be made in accordance with the below.“Starting Price” = The actual closing price of the Company’s ordinary shares on Nasdaq Stockholm on 31 May 2024 (the last day during the investment period for LTIP 2024)“Limit Price” = 4 * Starting Price“Final Price” = The actual closing price of the Company’s ordinary shares on Nasdaq Stockholm the trading that occurs immediately before the resolution of allotment of Performance Shares“Entitled Performance Shares” = The number of Performance Shares that a Participant would be entitled to without adjustmentThe new number of Performance Shares shall be no more than the Entitled Performance Shares and not less than the Limit Price / Final Price * Entitled Performance Shares.If a reduction in accordance with the formula above results in an uneven number of Performance Shares for a Participant  a rounding down shall be made.The Share TargetThe Share Target relates to the development of the Company’s diluted earnings per share during the period from the date of the Annual General Meeting 2024 up to and including 31 December 2026. For each financial year  a minimum level and a maximum level of earnings per share have been set for the allotment of Performance Shares. In the event of an outcome between the minimum level and the upper target level  earnings of the Performance Shares arising from the current Performance Target for the financial year will be made linearly in the range of SEK 2.50–3.50 earnings per share (financial year 2024)  SEK 3.50–4.50 earnings per share (financial year 2025)  SEK 4.50–5.50 earnings per share (financial year 2026).The Growth TargetThe Growth Target for each financial year has been set by the Board of Directors as a percentage measure of increased sales per financial year during LTIP 2024 compared to the Company’s established net sales for the financial year 2023. For each target  a minimum level and an upper target level have been set corresponding to zero (0) per cent and ten (10) per cent  respectively  for 2024  ten (10) per cent and twenty (20) per cent  respectively  for 2025  and ten (10) per cent and twenty (20) per cent  respectively  for 2026.The EBITA TargetThe EBITA Target for each financial year has been set by the Board of Directors as a percentage measure of increased EBITA per financial year during LTIP 2024 compared to the Company’s established EBITA for the financial year 2023. For each target  a weighted minimum level has been set for each financial year  which for the financial years 2024 corresponds to ten (10) per cent and a weighted upper target level of sixteen (16) per cent  respectively  and which for the financial years 2025 and 2026 corresponds to twelve (12.0) per cent and a weighted upper target level of eighteen (18.0) per cent  respectively.The Sustainability TargetThe Sustainability Target for each financial year has been set by the Board of Directors as percentage measure of (i) reduced Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions compared to the financial year 2022  and (ii) the share of purchased volume from sustainability approved suppliers. For each target  a minimum level and an upper target level has been set for each financial year. Regarding (i) above  for the financial year 2024 the minimum level has been set to nine (9) per cent and the upper target level to eleven (11) per cent  for the financial year 2025 the minimum level has been set to fourteen (14) per cent and the upper target level to sixteen (16) per cent  and for the financial year 2026 the minimum level has been set to nineteen (19) per cent and the upper target level to twenty-one (21) per cent. Regarding (ii) above  for the financial year 2024 the minimum level has been set to forty-five (45) per cent and the upper target level to fifty (50) per cent  for the financial year 2025 the minimum level has been set to fifty (50) per cent and the upper target level to sixty (60) per cent  and for the financial year 2026 the minimum level has been set to sixty (60) per cent and the upper target level to seventy (70) per cent.Terms and conditions of the Share RightsIn addition to what is stated above  the following conditions shall apply to the Share Rights under LTIP 2024:(a) The Participant must acquire the Saving Shares prior to the beginning of the Vesting Period or  in the case of subsequent additional Participants  at the time determined by the Company’s Remuneration Committee.(b) The Share Rights are vested during the Vesting Period or  in the case of subsequent additional Participants  proportionately  rounded down  calculated linearly on a full-year basis depending on when the additional Participant joins LTIP 2024.(c) The Share Rights cannot be transferred or pledged.(d) Each Share Right entitles the Participant  under certain conditions  to receive up to six (6) Performance Shares free of charge  depending on the position within the Hexatronic Group (see more on this above under “Terms and Conditions”)  after the end of the Vesting Period  provided that  subject to certain exceptions  the Participant has been employed in the Hexatronic Group during the Vesting Period and retains his or her original Saving Shares in the Company.Additional participantsIn the event that a Participant  following a resolution by the Company’s Remuneration Committee  is added after 31 May 2024  when calculating the maximum number of Saving Shares that the Participant may acquire  the Participant’s annual gross basic salary at the current time and a share price corresponding to the average of the average volume-weighted purchase price of the Company’s share on Nasdaq Stockholm during a period of ten trading days after the announcement of the quarterly report for the Company that is published immediately before the decision to allow the additional Participant to participate  rounded to the nearest SEK 0.10.For Saving Shares held by additional Participants within the LTIP 2024  the Company will award Share Rights proportionately  rounded down  calculated linearly on a full-year basis depending on when the additional Participant joins LTIP 2024. Additional Participants will be allotted Performance Shares no earlier than three (3) years after the Participant entered into an agreement to join LTIP 2024.Allotment of Performance SharesIn order to be able to complete LTIP 2024 in a cost-effective and flexible manner  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves  in accordance with item B below  that the Company’s commitments for delivery of and costs attributable to Performance Shares are primarily secured through a directed issue of a maximum of 1 343 596 shares of series C to Danske Bank A/S  Danske Bank filial Sverige (the “Bank”)  of which a maximum of 321 228 shares of series C may be issued to cover any social security contributions  with subsequent repurchases and conversion into ordinary shares and decisions on the transfer of own ordinary shares to the CEO and the management team  other senior executives and other key employees within the Hexatronic Group.The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves that a maximum of 1 022 368 ordinary shares may be transferred to Participants in accordance with LTIP 2024 and that a maximum of 321 228 ordinary shares may be transferred on the market to secure social security contributions in connection with LTIP 2024 (“Hedging Shares”).Costs for LTIP 2024Costs for LTIP 2024 are calculated in accordance with IFRS2 and are reported over the income statement.The cost is reported linearly over the Vesting Period.Based on the assumptions that LTIP 2024 will be fully subscribed by forty-five (45) Participants  that all of these invest the maximum amount allowed in Saving Shares in LTIP 2024  that the share price amounts to SEK twenty-five (25) at the time of investment  and that all Saving Shares remain at LTIP 2024’s end  this means a total cost for LTIP 2024 of approximately SEK 39.4 million  provided that the Performance Targets are fully achieved.The above amount also includes social security contributions  which are currently payable at a nominal rate of 31.42 per cent. With an assumed share price at LTIP 2024’s end of SEK seventy-five (75) and otherwise with conditions as above  the social security contributions are estimated to amount to approximately SEK 19.1 million (including tax related effects)  provided that the Performance Targets are fully achieved.If the Performance Targets are achieved so that half of the Performance Shares are allocated to the Participants  the corresponding total cost is estimated to amount to SEK 16.5 million. LTIP 2024 has no limit on maximum profit for Participants and therefore no maximum cost of social security contributions can be calculated. However  the Board of Directors has the possibility to limit the costs incurred by the Company under LTIP 2024  through the right to adjust the number of Performance Shares that each individual Participant otherwise would be entitled to upon allotment of Performance Shares  as set forth above.Effects on key performance indicators and dilutionLTIP 2024 is expected to comprise a maximum of 1 022 368 Performance Shares and 321 228 Hedging Shares for social security contributions  excluding the Saving Shares  corresponding to approximately 0.66 per cent of the Company’s total number of outstanding shares after full exercise of ongoing and now resolved incentive programmes.Outstanding rights to shares under previous long-term incentive programmes and the proposed long-term incentive programme amount to approximately 2.91 per cent of the Company’s total number of outstanding shares upon full exercise.Ongoing incentive programmes including LTIP 2024 are expected to have only marginal impact on significant key performance indicators.Additional ongoing share-based incentive programmesFor a description of the Company’s ongoing long-term incentive programmes  please refer to the Annual Report for the financial year 2023 which will be available on the Company’s website  https://group.hexatronic.com/ .Preparation of the proposalLTIP 2024 has been prepared by the Board of Directors in consultation with the Remuneration Committee and external advisers.The Board of Directors or a special committee set up by the Board of Directors shall be responsible for the detailed design and management of the terms and conditions for LTIP 2024  in accordance with the above-mentioned terms and conditions including provisions on recalculation in the event of an in-between bonus issue  share split  rights issue and/or other similar events. In connection therewith  the Board of Directors shall have the right to make adjustments to meet specific market conditions. The Board of Directors shall also have the right to make other adjustments if there are significant changes in the Hexatronic Group or its operating environment that would result in the adopted terms and conditions for LTIP 2024 no longer fulfilling its purposes.B. Directed issue of convertible shares of series C  authorisation for the Board of Directors to resolve on the repurchase of all issued redeemable and convertible shares of series C  and transfer of own ordinary shares to Participants in accordance with LTIP 2024In order to be able to carry out LTIP 2024 in a cost-effective and flexible manner  the Board of Directors proposes that the Company’s commitments for delivery of and costs attributable to Performance Shares be secured primarily through a directed issue of convertible shares of series C  with subsequent repurchases and conversion into ordinary shares and resolution on the transfer of own ordinary shares to Participants.The reasons for the deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights in the proposed new issue of shares of series C and the purpose of the proposed repurchase authorisation are to ensure delivery of shares to the Participants in accordance with LTIP 2024 and to cover any social security contributions due to LTIP 2024.The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting instructs the Board of Directors to implement the resolution above and to ensure that the Board of Directors transfers the Performance Shares in accordance with what is stated above. The Board further proposes that the Annual General Meeting instructs the Board  or whomever the Board appoints  to make such minor adjustments in the abovementioned proposed resolutions that may prove necessary in connection with registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.Item 17 – Resolution to adopt a long-term incentive programme for the Hexatronic Group’s employees outside of Sweden (Warrant programme 2024)The Board of Directors’ of Hexatronic Group AB (publ) (the “Company”) proposal that the Annual General Meeting resolves on (A) the adoption of a long-term incentive programme (Warrant Programme 2024) directed to the group’s (the “Hexatronic Group”) employees outside of Sweden  and (B) a directed issue of warrants (Series 2024/2027) to the wholly owned subsidiary Proximion AB (“Proximion”) and approval of the transfer of these warrants to participants.

All in all  it is the Board’s assessment that the Warrant Programme 2024 will be beneficial for both the employees and for the Company’s shareholders through an increased share value.Warrant Programme 2024The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves on a directed share issue of a maximum of 442 500 warrants (hereinafter referred to as “Warrants”) and the subsequent transfer of a total of not more than 442 500 Warrants.

The exercise price and the number of shares that each Warrant entitles to subscription for shall be recalculated in the event of a split  consolidation  new share issue etc. in accordance with market practice.Allocation of WarrantsThe Warrant Programme 2024 shall comprise approximately 33 senior executives  and approximately 80 key employees  employed mainly in England  Belgium  Norway  Denmark  Finland  USA  Canada  Germany  Estonia  Latvia  Lithuania  Italy  Australia  South Korea  the Netherlands  New Zealand and Austria and in total relate to a maximum of 442 500 Warrants. The maximum number of Warrants per participant in the Warrant Programme 2024 is shown in the table below.Category Maximum number of Warrants per person Maximum number of Warrants per category Senior executives approximately 9 000 approximately 196 500 Remaining key employees approximately 3 000 approximately 246 000In the event of changes in positions and employments  remaining Warrants in one category may be used in another category. The Board of Directors may decide that such Warrants that are not allotted in accordance with the above shall later be allocated to any new employees within the Hexatronic Group.Effects on key performance indicators and costsThe Warrants are issued free of charge to the participants and may incur social security contributions and costs in accordance with the accounting rules in IFRS2. The Board of Directors estimates that these costs will be limited.Since the Company’s costs for the Warrant Programme 2024 will be relatively limited  the Board of Directors has decided not to propose to the Annual General Meeting to decide on measures to cover these.Ongoing incentive programmes including Warrant Programme 2024 are expected to have only marginal impact on significant key performance indicators.DilutionBased on the existing number of ordinary shares in the Company  the Warrant Programme 2024  upon full exercise of all 442 500 Warrants  entails a dilution corresponding to approximately 0 22 per cent of the capital and votes related to ordinary shares. If all outstanding incentive programmes in the Company are included in the calculation  the corresponding maximum dilution  at the time of the Annual General Meeting  amounts to approximately 2 91 per cent of the capital and the number of votes related to ordinary shares.Additional ongoing share-based incentive programmesFor a description of the Company’s ongoing long-term incentive programmes  please refer to the Annual Report for the financial year 2023 which will be available on the Company’s website  https://group.hexatronic.com.Preparation of the proposalThe Warrant Programme 2024 has been prepared by the Board of Directors in consultation with company management and external advisors.The Board of Directors or a special committee set up by the Board of Directors shall be responsible for the detailed design and management of the terms and conditions for the Warrant Programme 2024  in accordance with the above-mentioned terms and conditions including provisions on recalculation in the event of an in-between bonus issue  share split  rights issue and/or other similar events. In connection therewith  the Board of Directors shall have the right to make adjustments to meet specific market conditions. The Board of Directors shall also have the right to make other adjustments if there are significant changes in the Hexatronic Group or its operating environment that would result in the decided terms of the Warrant Programme 2024 no longer fulfilling its purposes.B. Directed issue of warrants  Series 2024/2027  to the wholly owned subsidiary Proximion  and approval of the transfer of these to participants under the Warrant Programme 2024The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to issue not more than 442 500 Warrants  as a result of which the Company’s share capital may increase by a maximum of SEK 4 425. The following conditions shall apply.The right to subscribe for Warrants shall  with deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights  vest with Proximion  which shall then transfer the Warrants to the appropriate participants in the Warrant Programme 2024. Each Warrant entitles the holder to subscribe for one share. The Warrants shall be issued free of charge to Proximion. Each warrant entitles the holder to subscribe for one new ordinary share in Hexatronic Group AB (publ) during the period from and including 13 May 2027 up to and including 13 June 2027 at a subscription price of 135 per cent of the volume-weighted average share price of the Hexatronic share during the measurement period from and including 8 May 2024 up to and including 19 May 2024. The Board of Directors has the right to extend the subscription period  but no more than six months. The exercise price and the number of shares that each Warrant entitles to subscription of shall be recalculated in the event of a split  reverse share split  new issue of shares  etc. in accordance with market practice. The amount that  in the case of share subscription  exceeds the quota value shall be transferred to the free premium fund. Subscription of Warrants must be made on the subscription list no later than 31 May 2024. However  the Board of Directors shall have the right to extend the subscription period. The Warrants are issued free of charge to Proximion. New shares pursuant to subscription entitle to dividends for the first time on the record date for dividends that occurs immediately after subscription has been effected. The warrants shall in all other respects be governed by the terms and conditions set forth in Appendix A.The Board of Directors also proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to approve that Proximion  in accordance with the incentive programme  may transfer Warrants to participants in the Warrant Programme 2024 and manage Warrants in accordance with the Warrant Programme 2024. Proximion shall have the right to retain such Warrants that are not allotted in accordance with the above for later allotment to additional employees within the Hexatronic Group as decided by the Company’s Board of Directors.It is further proposed that the Board of Directors  or whomever they appoint  should be authorised to undertake such minor adjustments in the resolution that may be required for the registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.Oversubscription cannot be made.The rationale for the deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights is to implement incentive programmes for employees outside of Sweden in the Hexatronic Group.The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting instructs the Board of Directors to implement the resolutions above and to ensure that the Board of Directors in Proximion transfers the Warrants in accordance with what is stated above.The Board further proposes that the Annual General Meeting instructs the Board  or whomever the Board appoints  to make such minor adjustments in the abovementioned proposed resolutions that may prove necessary in connection with registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.Item 18 – Resolution to authorise the Board of Directors to resolve on the acquisition and transfer of own sharesThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to authorise the Board of Directors  for the period until the end of the next Annual General Meeting  on one or several occasions  to resolve to acquire the Company’s own ordinary shares. The Board of Directors further proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to authorise the Board of Directors  for the period until the end of the next Annual General Meeting  on one or several occasions  to resolve to transfer the own ordinary shares held by the Company at the time of the Board of Directors’ resolution on transfer. The following conditions shall apply.Ordinary shares may be acquired to the extent that the Company’s holding of its own shares  on any occasion  does not exceed ten (10) per cent of the Company’s total outstanding shares (regardless of share class).The ordinary shares may be acquired through an offer directed to all shareholders or through trading on Nasdaq Stockholm. Upon acquisition of own ordinary shares through trading on Nasdaq Stockholm the price shall correspond to the price interval on Nasdaq Stockholm registered at any given time  by which is meant the interval between the highest purchase price and the lowest sale price in the Company’s ordinary shares. Acquisition offers directed to all shareholders may only be made for consideration in cash and shall be made at a price corresponding to the registered price interval at any given time with a maximum deviation of 30 per cent upwards.The purpose of the proposed authorisation is to give the Board of Directors the opportunity to adapt the Company’s capital structure to its capital needs and thereby  among other things  be able to use the repurchased ordinary shares as a means of payment for the acquisition of companies.Transfer of own ordinary shares may be made through transfer on Nasdaq Stockholm at a price within the price interval on Nasdaq Stockholm registered at any given time  which means the interval between the highest purchase price and the lowest sale price in the Company’s ordinary shares. Transfer of ordinary shares acquired in accordance with the above may also take place outside Nasdaq Stockholm  with or without deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights and with or without provisions on non-cash consideration or right of set-off. Transfer of own ordinary shares may  for example  be used as a means of payment in connection with company acquisitions on terms in accordance with the Swedish Companies Act’s rules on new issues. Such transfer may be made at a price in cash  or value of property obtained  which  in the case of a business acquisition  corresponds to the stock exchange price in the Company’s ordinary shares at the time of the transfer.If the exercise of the authorisation regarding the acquisition and transfer of own ordinary shares is combined with the exercise of the authorisation regarding the new issue of shares  warrants and/or convertibles  item 19 on the agenda  for the purpose of financing all or part of the purchase price in the event of one and the same business acquisition or one and the same investment in connection with the conclusion of a new contract or the start-up of a new business area  the number of ordinary shares transferred and financial instruments issued during the period until the end of the next Annual General Meeting  together may not exceed one tenth of all outstanding shares in the Company at the time of the resolution authorizing a new issue.The possibility of deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights when transferring own ordinary shares is justified by the fact that transfer of ordinary shares on Nasdaq Stockholm or otherwise with deviation from preferential rights for shareholders can take place with greater speed  flexibility and is more cost-effective than transfer to all shareholders. If the Company’s own ordinary shares are transferred for consideration in a form other than cash in connection with agreements on the acquisition of assets  the Company cannot give shareholders the opportunity to exercise any preferential rights.The Board of Directors  or any person appointed by the Board of Directors  shall have the right to make any adjustments or amendments of the above resolution which may be required in connection with the registration of such resolution and to take any other measure deemed necessary for the execution of the resolution.Item 19 – Resolution to authorise the Board of Directors to resolve on new issues of shares  warrants and/or convertiblesThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to authorise the Board of Directors  for the period until the end of the next Annual General Meeting  on one or several occasions and with or without deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights  to resolve on new share issues  warrants and/or convertibles corresponding to not more than ten (10) per cent of the registered share capital in the Company at the time of the issue resolution.The authorisation may be utilised for new issues  which may be made with provisions regarding contribution in cash  in kind or through set-off. In order to enable delivery of shares in connection with a cash issue as described above  this may  if the Board of Directors deems it appropriate  be made at a subscription price corresponding to the quota value of the shares  whereby the issue is directed to an issuing agency acting as a settlement bank for investors.Deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights shall only be possible in connection with company acquisitions. If the Board of Directors resolves on an issue with deviation from the shareholders’ preferential rights  the rationale shall be that the Company quickly needs access to capital in the event of a company acquisition or alternatively need to pay with the Company’s shares  warrants and/or convertibles.If the exercise of the authorisation regarding a new share issue is combined with the exercise of the authorisation regarding the acquisition and transfer of own ordinary shares  item 18 on the agenda  in order to finance all or part of the purchase price in one and the same company acquisition  the number of shares transferred and issued during the period until the end of the next Annual General Meeting  together may not exceed one tenth of all shares in the Company at the time of the resolution to authorise a new share issue.Item 20 – Resolution regarding guidelines for remuneration to senior executivesThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves on the adoption of the following guidelines for remuneration to senior executives.ScopeThese guidelines encompass the Executive Management of Hexatronic Group AB (publ) (‘Hexatronic’) and the company’s Board Members to the extent that remuneration  other than that decided at the AGM  is paid to Board Members. Executive Management refers to the CEO  Deputy CEO  CFO and other members of the Executive Management. Other members of the Executive Management refer to people who are part of the management team and managers who are directly subordinate to the CEO. The managers who are directly subordinated to the CEO may change over time. Currently the Deputy CEO  CFO  Logistics Director  Business Development Director  Digital Marketing Officer and some of the Presidents of Hexatronic’s subsidiaries are directly subordinated to the CEO.The guidelines are prospective and shall be applied to remuneration that is agreed  and to changes made to already agreed remuneration  after the guidelines are adopted by the 2024 AGM. The guidelines do not cover remuneration decided by the general meeting of shareholders.As regards employment conditions that comply with rules that are not Swedish  appropriate adaptations may be made to follow mandatory such rules or set local practices  whereby the overall objectives of these guidelines are met as far as possible.Promoting the company’s business strategy  long-term interests and sustainabilityThe company strives for greater global presence  where Hexatronic’s products and solutions are connected in more and more systems. The company’s business concept is with smart  reliable product and system solutions for passive fiber infrastructure to accelerate the digital transformation for the benefit of businesses  individuals and society at large.Successful and sustainable implementation of the company’s business strategy in the long run requires the company to be able to recruit and retain qualified employees. For this the company must be able to offer competitive remuneration. These guidelines make it possible to offer senior executives a competitive total remuneration package.Variable cash payments covered by these guidelines should also aim to promote the company’s business strategy and long-term interests  including its sustainability.Remuneration to senior executivesForms of remuneration etc.Hexatronic shall offer total compensation at market rates to facilitate the recruitment and retention of qualified senior executives. Remuneration from Hexatronic should be based on the principles of performance  competitiveness and fairness. Remuneration to senior executives shall comprise fixed remuneration  variable remuneration  share and share price-based incentive programmes  pension and other benefits. Variations in the remuneration principles are permitted where they are justified by local conditions.Fixed remuneration shall take into account the individual’s experience and areas of responsibility. Fixed salaries shall be reviewed annually. Variable remuneration may be up to 50% of the annual fixed salary for members of the Executive Management. Variable cash payments covered by these guidelines should aim to promote the company’s business strategy and long-term interests  including its sustainability  by having a clear link to the business strategy or promoting the senior executive’s long-term development  for example.It must be possible to measure whether or not the criteria for variable cash payments have been met over a period of one year. Variable remuneration shall be linked to pre-determined  quantifiable criteria  established with the aim of promoting the company’s long-term value creation. When the measurement period for meeting the criteria for variable cash payments has ended  it must be judged/established to what extent the criteria have been met. The Remuneration Committee is responsible for the assessment regarding variable cash payment to the CEO. As regards variable cash payments to other senior executives  the CEO is responsible for the assessment. Financial goals shall be assessed based on the latest financial information published by the company.PensionFor the CEO and other senior executives  pension benefits shall be based on how much is paid in  i.e. the pensions are defined contribution plans.The pension contributions for the CEO and the Deputy CEO’s defined contribution pension can be up to 30% of the pensionable salary. The retirement age for other senior executives varies between 60 and 67 years and the pension contribution can be up to 30% of the pensionable salary. Variable cash payments shall not be pensionable.Other benefits may include life assurance  health insurance and car benefits  for example. Such benefits shall not account for a material portion of the total remuneration.Cash paymentAdditional cash payments may be made in extraordinary circumstances  provided that such extraordinary arrangements are limited in time and are only made at an individual level  either with the aim of recruiting or retaining senior executives  or as remuneration for extraordinary work efforts beyond the person’s regular work duties. Such remuneration shall be professionally motivated  proportionate to the individual’s fixed salary and shall not be paid more than once a year per individual. Decisions about such remuneration shall be made by the Board on the proposal of the Remuneration Committee.In addition the AGM can  if agreed  offer long-term incentive programmes  such as share or share price-related remuneration or incentive programmes. Such long-term incentive programmes are agreed by the general meeting of shareholders and are therefore not covered by these guidelines.Criteria for paying variable remuneration etc.Variable remuneration shall be linked to pre-determined  quantifiable criteria that may be financial or non-financial. It must be possible to measure whether or not the criteria for short-term variable remuneration have been met over a period of one year. The criteria may also comprise individually adapted quantitative or qualitative goals. The criteria for both shortterm and long-term variable remuneration shall be structured so that they promote the company’s business strategy and long-term interests  including its sustainability  by having a clear link to the business strategy or promoting the senior executive’s long-term development  for example.When the measurement period for meeting the criteria for variable remuneration has ended  it must be established to what extent the criteria have been met. The Remuneration Committee is responsible for carrying out this assessment. As regards financial goals  the assessment shall be based on the latest financial information published by the company.By law or in accordance with agreements and subject to the resulting limitations  the Board shall be able to wholly or partially reclaim variable remuneration paid out on false grounds.Remuneration to Board MembersRemuneration to Board Members for their work on Hexatronic’s Board of Directors is determined by the general meeting of shareholders. Board Members are only entitled to receive such fees as agreed by the general meeting of shareholders. Additional remuneration may  however  be paid for services carried out by Board Members for Hexatronic within their respective areas of expertise  provided that said service is outside of what is considered to be the normal assignment for Board Members. Such remuneration shall be at market rates and settled in a consultancy agreement approved by the Board.Terms of employmentSalary and terms of employment for employeesWhen drafting the Board’s proposal for these remuneration guidelines  the salary and terms of employment for the company’s employees were taken into account by using information about employees’ total remuneration  components of the remuneration  increases in remuneration and the rate of increase over time as part of the basis for the Remuneration Committee and Board’s decision when evaluating the fairness of the guidelines and the resulting limitations.Termination of employmentA notice period of six (6) months shall apply if the CEO resigns. No severance pay shall be forthcoming.If employment is terminated by the company  the notice period for the CEO may be up to twelve (12) months. Severance pay is only paid from the CEO’s 50th birthday and then amounts to one month’s salary for each year over 50 when the CEO is given notice. For example  if the CEO is given notice at the age of 51  the severance pay will amount to one (1) month’s salary  and at the age of 52 it amounts to two (2) months’ salary  etc. No deductions are made from severance pay for other income.There is a mutual period of notice of a minimum of three (3) and a maximum of twelve (12) months between the company and other senior executives. No severance pay shall be forthcoming.Furthermore  remuneration for restraint-of-trade obligations will be paid to the CEO and other senior executives alike when employment is terminated with the aim of compensating for any loss of income.For the CEO  such remuneration is only paid to the extent that they are not entitled to severance pay.The remuneration shall be the difference between the fixed cash salary at the time of termination and any lower income earned in the new business  but up to 60% of the fixed cash salary. Remuneration shall be paid for the time the restraint-of-trade obligation applies  which shall be up to 6 months after termination of employment.Decision-making process  changes and deviations etc.The decision-making process for establishing  reviewing and implementing the guidelines The entire Board constitutes the Remuneration Committee. The Committee’s duties include drafting the Board’s decisions on proposed guidelines for remuneration to senior executives. The Board shall draw up proposals for new guidelines at least every four years and present the proposal at the AGM for a decision. The guidelines shall apply until new guidelines have been adopted by the general meeting of shareholders. The Remuneration Committee shall also monitor and evaluate programmes for variable remuneration for the Executive Management  the application of the guidelines for remuneration to senior executives  as well as applicable remuneration structures and remuneration levels in the company. The members of the Remuneration Committee are independent of the company and Executive Management. When the Board deals with and decides on remuneration related issues  the CEO or other members of the company management are not present to the extent that they are affected by the issues.Deviating from the guidelinesThe Board may temporarily deviate from the guidelines  wholly or partially  in individual cases  if there are special reasons for doing so and a deviation is necessary in order to satisfy the company’s long-term interests  including its sustainability  or to safeguard the company’s financial strength. As stated above  the Remuneration Committee’s duties include drafting the Board’s decisions on remuneration issues  which includes decisions on deviating from the guidelines.Substantial changes to the guidelines adopted by the 2020 Annual General MeetingThe proposal to the Annual General Meeting 2024 for the adoption of the following guidelines for remuneration to senior executives is in all material respects consistent with the guidelines adopted by the Annual General Meeting 2020.

38573,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/deutsche-b-rse-etr-db1-052303792.html,Deutsche Börse (ETR:DB1) Is Paying Out A Larger Dividend Than Last Year,Deutsche Börse AG (ETR:DB1) will increase its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 17th of May to €3.80. Despite this raise  the dividend yield of 2.0% is only a modest boost to shareholder returns. See our latest analysis for Deutsche ...,Deutsche Börse AG (ETR:DB1) will increase its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 17th of May to €3.80. Despite this raise  the dividend yield of 2.0% is only a modest boost to shareholder returns.See our latest analysis for Deutsche BörseDeutsche Börse's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsThe dividend yield is a little bit low  but sustainability of the payments is also an important part of evaluating an income stock. Prior to this announcement  Deutsche Börse's dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This indicates that a lot of the earnings are being reinvested into the business  with the aim of fueling growth.Looking forward  earnings per share is forecast to rise by 21.3% over the next year. If the dividend continues on this path  the payout ratio could be 36% by next year  which we think can be pretty sustainable going forward.Deutsche Börse Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has been paying a dividend for a long time  and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. The dividend has gone from an annual total of €2.10 in 2014 to the most recent total annual payment of €3.80. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 6.1% a year over that time. The dividend has been growing very nicely for a number of years  and has given its shareholders some nice income in their portfolios.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. We are encouraged to see that Deutsche Börse has grown earnings per share at 16% per year over the past five years. Since earnings per share is growing at an acceptable rate  and the payout policy is balanced  we think the company is positioning itself well to grow earnings and dividends in the future.Deutsche Börse Looks Like A Great Dividend StockIn summary  it is always positive to see the dividend being increased  and we are particularly pleased with its overall sustainability. The company is easily earning enough to cover its dividend payments and it is great to see that these earnings are being translated into cash flow. All in all  this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.Investors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent  stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. Still  investors need to consider a host of other factors  apart from dividend payments  when analysing a company. Taking the debate a bit further  we've identified 1 warning sign for Deutsche Börse that investors need to be conscious of moving forward.

It tested the possibility of creating a seemingly vulnerable environment to attract hackers  as ""a jar of honey"" attracts bees  and then observing and recording their malicious activities. The study pre-configured  assuming the analysis carried out on the data collected  the possibility of structuring and implementing more effective solutions to prevent and mitigate threats  respond to hacker attacks on ICT systems. In 2019 Ithea  the research hub of the Relatech Group  began a virtuous collaboration with the DIMES Department on the Emphasis project  now renamedEMPHAsisEvolution  within theCalabria Region's Ingenuity Call .The final aim of the project was to increase the level of technological readiness of the first prototype of the Emphasis platform  extending its architecture to make it an industrial solution  and therefore a tool that can be used by companies and institutions that wish to invest in innovative cybersecurity solutions to complement the security mechanisms already in place in their realities. The main innovations made concerned the areas of design and cybersecurity  to improve the ability to detect and respond to threats  thanks to new technologies and advanced methodologies  demonstrating their applicability in real contexts.During the seminar  the results of the Emphasis Evolution project  carried out from January 2022 to 30 September 2023  will be presented by the experts of Ithea and DIMES who participated in theproject. The event will be attended by the team of Cybersecurity professionals of the Relatech Group  an exponent of Fincalabra (the body managing the funds of the Project Call on behalf of the Calabria Region)  professors and researchers of the University of Calabria engaged in innovation projects in cybersecurity and other digital areas.The seminar will also be an opportunity for Relatech to illustrate the Group's offering and to deepen the suite of services and products in the field of cybersecurity  with a particular focus on theReSOCservice the Security Operation Center of the Relatech Group.Pasquale Lambardi  Chairman and CEO of Relatech  commented: ""We are very happy and satisfied to have taken part in this project through our Ithea research center together with the University of Calabria This is how our journey as digital enablers continues in this new year; these events are very important for us  as they highlight the vision of the Relatech Group as a functional ecosystem to always innovate  going hand in hand with today's rapid digitalization  and creating positive synergies between experts in the sector.

At the same time  and in line with our development strategy  we have stepped up our efforts in terms of industrial efficiency  innovation and decarbonization within our two divisions  Joinery and Concrete. With this in mind  we recently signed a share purchase agreement to sell our Building Materials Trading  Public Works and Natural Stone businesses to SAMSE Group.For 2024  our Group is pressing ahead with integration of its latest acquisitions  particularly in the joinery and industrial concrete sectors  where we aim to consolidate our positions.On the strength of our robust financial structure and our two business lines  where we can demonstrate leadership thanks to our products  our innovations and our CSR approach  the Group's management believes it is well equipped to weather this market cycle  as we have demonstrated in the past.”A performance that validates the Group's strategy to refocus on its industrial businessesIn 2023  HERIGE Group posted turnover of €835.6 million  up 5.4% (or down 3.2% like for like) on 2022. Based on its continuing operations  the Group posted turnover of €460.8 million in 2023  up 19.7% (up 2.3% like for like). Despite a deteriorated construction market (single housing unit permits down 28.5% year on year)  HERIGE has demonstrated its resilience  with performance driven by the external growth operations completed in 2022.It posted a gross margin of €338.2 million  up €25.2 million compared to 2022  representing 40.5% of turnover  up 1 point versus the prior year. Based on its continuing operations  the gross margin came to €228.1 million  or 49.5% of turnover (on a 2022 pro forma basis  the gross margin came to €187.5 million  or 48.7% of sales).In response to the struggling new construction market  the Group quickly took steps to improve its operating performance  which limited the decline in EBITDA over the year. As a result  2023 EBITDA totaled €46.8 million  down by just €8.7 million  representing an EBITDA margin of 5.6%  down 1.4 points on 2022. For the Group's future scope of consolidation  the EBITDA margin was 7.8%  down 0.9 points compared with 2022 on a pro forma basis.HERIGE's operating income came in at €25.6 million (down €11.6 million compared to 2022)  representing an operating margin of 3.1% versus 4.7% one year earlier. For the Group's future scope of consolidation  operating profit amounted to €21.6 million  or 4.7% of turnover.After taking into account a net financial expense of €5.4 million (vs. a €1.8 million expense in 2022) and a non?recurring loss of €2.0 million (vs. a €1.6 million loss one year earlier)  net income  Group share amounted to €9.3 million in 2023 (vs. €21.9 million in 2022).Robust financial structureInvestments amounted to €24.9 million in 2023  stable compared with 2022.At December 31  2023  reported net cash stood at €0.5 million  penalized by a one-off peak in working capital requirement (WCR) due mainly to an unusual reduction in purchases at the end of the year. Adjusted for this impact  which is set to smooth out  net cash amounted to €26.3 million  compared with €35.6 million in 2022  and net financial debt remained under control at €130.3 million (compared with €156.1 million as reported).With shareholders' equity of €145.4 million  the adjusted net debt-to-equity ratio was 89.6% (versus the reported figure of 107.3%) compared with 102.9% one year earlier  a 13-point decrease.For the Group's future scope of consolidation and adjusted for the one-off peak in WCR  the net debt-to-equity ratio was 10%  with shareholders' equity of €169.4 million and net financial debt of €16.9 million.Proposed dividend payment of €1.90 per shareOn the basis of the 2023 annual results and the financial profile of continuing operations  the Supervisory Board decided to propose to shareholders the payment of a dividend of €1.90 per share at the Annual General Meeting to be held on May 31  2024. The payment will be made from June 10  2024 (ex-coupon date of June 6  2024).Outlook and developmentsIn a sharply declining market  HERIGE nevertheless intends to continue implementing its strategic priorities by leveraging the favorable regulatory context: a two-fold increase in the MaPrimeRénov' renovation program and extension of the Prêt à Taux Zéro interest-free loan until 2027  with relaxed eligibility conditions. On the strength of these factors and its robust financial structure  the Group is well placed to weather this market cycle  thanks in particular to its industrial performance and cost management program.With the planned sale of the Building Materials Trading  Public Works and Natural Stone businesses (VM Matériaux  LNTP and Cominex) to SAMSE Group  all the Group's teams are centered around a single ambition: to become a high-quality  customer-focused and environmentally committed industrial player.NEXT PUBLICATION: Q1 2024 turnover on May 14  2024 (after the close of trading)All our financial communications are available on our website: www.groupe-herige.fr/enABOUT HERIGEHERIGE Group focuses on three sectors of the building industry: Building Materials Trading  the Concrete Industry and Industrial Joinery.

Dematerialised shares do not benefit from the double voting right. The method used by VGP to calculate the holding period of two consecutive years is the LIFO (""last in  first out"") method  i.e.: for the same registered shareholder  the shares that the latter has most recently acquired are the first shares that will be deducted from his total amount of registered shares if he/she transfers shares to a third party. Any share converted into a dematerialised share or the ownership of which is transferred loses the double voting right as from its dematerialisation or entry of its transfer in VGP’s share register. It is therefore important that VGP be kept informed of any transfer of registered shares by the transferor and/or the transferee promptly at the time of each transfer in order to enable VGP to keep its register of registered shares and  consequently  the number of registered shares with double voting rights up to date.ABOUT VGPVGP is a pan-European owner  manager and developer of high-quality logistics and semi-industrial real estate.

Thanks to our unique expertise  we aim to accelerate our international expansion  in particular by promoting our luxury  sports  tourism  lifestyle  and cultural businesses to the widest possible audience.This momentum is made possible by the unfailing commitment of our teams and the trust placed in us by our clients. I would like to thank them in particular. ""Pierre-Franck Moley  Managing Director and Chair of the Board of Hopscotch Sopexa:""With its positive reputation  the power of the Hopscotch brand  and its financial resources  the group presents itself as a consolidator in the market  enabling it to aim for strong growth in the coming years.""An Expanding International GroupToday  HOPSCOTCH employs around 1 000 people  half of whom work internationally in EMEA  North America  and Asia. Thanks to a strong entrepreneurial culture that encourages initiative at all levels  the group is agile and responsive to respond to a rapidly changing market.Hopscotch's ability to integrate all communications activities under a single roof  and to benefit from a perfectly integrated international network  sets it apart from its competitors.Continued Business GrowthAs previously announced  the group's business is once again showing clear growth  thanks in particular to the continuing increase in events  but also to growth in the Public Relations and digital businesses. Positioned at the crossroads of the experiential and the influential  HOPSCOTCH is at the heart of its clients' communication needs.Gross margin reached 92.9 million euros  again a record high in the group's history.Solid OperationsWith operating conditions well under control  the group confirmed a favorable profit margin  with consolidated operating profit of 9.9 million euros and a gross margin of 92.9 million euros  or 10.7%. This good performance includes investments in prospecting and innovation (including AI) in preparation for 2024 and its major sporting and cultural events. As a result  personnel costs have risen slightly more than necessary to support growth in 2023. Normative earnings would easily have exceeded 10 million euros without these exceptional charges.Financial expenses were higher this year due to non-recurring entries (accounting charge of €850 thousand) relating to the rationalisation of the Group's legal structure and the deconsolidation of a discontinued business  as well as the renewal of the head office lease  which generated an accounting charge of €125 thousand in connection with IFRS 16.After net financial expense of -€2 665 thousand  and income taxes of -€1 992 thousand  net income came to €5 185 thousand  down slightly due to the temporary surcharge linked to the financial loss.Strongly Consolidated Financial StructureThe balance sheet structure has been consolidated  with shareholders' equity increasing to 31.5 million euros (28 million euros on December 31  2022).Financial debt excluding PGE (The French State Guaranteed Loan) amounted to 6.6 million euros  down 3.5 million euros on the previous year. At the same time  PGE (The French State Guaranteed Loan) debt fell by 4.4 million euros during the year  leaving a closing balance of 14.8 million euros.The cash position remains strongly positive at 42.2 million euros  including the unused EMP of 14.8 million euros.The net financial position is therefore positive and improving  at 20.8 million euros versus 14.8 million euros last year.The Executive Board therefore proposes to the Annual General Meeting of May 30  2024 to distribute a dividend of 0.65 euros per share  an increase of 30% (0.50 euros in 2023).2024 PerspectivesSince the release of Covid  the events business has seen a strong rebound  a structural phenomenon that responds to a need for physical meetings  whether B2C or B2B. At the same time  the growing complexity of communications  the impact of influencers and the associated reputational risk all call for greater expertise in mastering what companies have to say.We continue to see good momentum in activities linked to public relations and mastering reputational challenges (Social Media  Influence  Public Affairs  Public Relations  Content)  which has resulted in numerous gains in newbiz.In January 2024  Hopscotch finalized the acquisition of the 4 companies making up the Interface Tourism group in France  Spain  Italy and the Netherlands  which will become Hopscotch Interface Tourism.The transaction  half in cash and half in newly issued shares  will be accretive: in 2023  the gross margin generated by Hopscotch Interface Tourism will exceed 8 million euros  and the operating margin will exceed 15%.By consolidating the Tourism division in 2024  the Group's gross margin will exceed 100 million euros  and operating margin should improve.Thanks to its solid financial structure  the group will pursue its strategy of external growth  with an international focus  and continue to strengthen its position in growth areas such as influence  with  for example  the recent integration of a team of 12 specialized consultants.Hopscotch thus aims to become a leading communications group worldwide.CSRHOPSCOTCH has been fully committed to the ecological transition for over 15 years now  a conviction and mobilization recognized by numerous labels and certifications over the years (Agence Active label certification  and Ecovadis). The roup puts its experience and expertise to work for its clients  for whom these issues are becoming increasingly important. In this respect  HOPSCOTCH is mobilized to accompany changes in regulations  and more particularly the entry into force of the CSRD  which will necessarily give rise to needs in terms of responsible communication.AIHOPSCOTCH sees this technology as a way of making certain services more efficient and thus optimizing consulting value  but also as an opportunity to invent and offer new business lines. The group has invested in its own platform and set up a team of experts to keep abreast of technological developments. AI is already rightly integrated into many client operations.HOPSCOTCH Groupe will publish its turnover for Q1 2024 on May 2  2024  after market close.________Shareholder ContactPierre-Franck MOLEY - Directeur Général - Tel. 01 41 34 20 56 - pfmoley@hopscotchgroupe.comPress ContactJodie KNOEPFLER CONSCIENCE – Assistant to the Executive Board - Tel. 01 41 34 20 51 - jodiekc@hopscotchgroupe.com________About HOPSCOTCH GroupeHOPSCOTCH is an international communications group created in France and run by its founders and managers  all guided by an entrepreneurial vision driven by complementary expertise.

April 02  2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NANOBIOTIX (Euronext : NANO –– NASDAQ: NBTX – the ‘‘Company’’)  a late-clinical stage biotechnology company pioneering physics-based approaches to expand treatment possibilities for patients with cancer  today announced completion of the dose escalation part of a Phase 1 study evaluating potential first-in-class radioenhancer NBTXR3 for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”) that cannot be treated by surgery (“inoperable”)  and has come back (“recurrent”)  whom have previously been treated with definitive radiation therapy and are amenable to re-irradiation. The Phase 1 study (“Study 2020-0123”) is being conducted by The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (“MD Anderson”) as part of an ongoing strategic collaboration with Nanobiotix.“NBTXR3 is designed as a product candidate with the potential to improve treatment outcomes for patients with cancer in any setting where radiotherapy is a part of the treatment regimen. While these patients experience different cancer types and are each faced with unique challenges  what they share is an urgent need for therapeutic innovation with the chance to make a difference ” said Louis Kayitalire  MD  Chief Medical Officer at Nanobiotix. “We believe the injection feasibility and favorable safety profile we have observed from the completed dose escalation part of this Phase 1 lung cancer study could pave the way for additional clinical development of NBTXR3 for patients with inoperable  recurrent lung cancer and patients amenable to re-irradiation.”The completed dose escalation part of Study 2020-0123 established the recommended Phase 2 dose after determination of injection feasibility and observation of a favorable safety profile. The expansion part of the study  further evaluating safety and early signals of efficacy  is ongoing.About MD ANDERSON STUDY 2020-0123MD Anderson Study 2020-0123 (NCT04505267) is a Phase 1 study evaluating the best dose and observing the adverse effects of NBTXR3 activated by radiation therapy (“RT”) for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”) that cannot be treated with surgery (“inoperable”)  and has come back (“recurrent”)  in patients who have previously been treated with definitive RT. The primary objectives of the study include a safety assessment of re-irradiation in these patients and determination of the recommended Phase 2 dose of NBTXR3 activated by RT. The re-irradiation safety assessment part and the dose-finding part of the study have completed. An expansion part evaluating additional signals of safety  feasibility  anti-tumor response  and time-to-event outcomes is ongoing.About NBTXR3NBTXR3 is a novel  potentially first-in-class oncology product composed of functionalized hafnium oxide nanoparticles that is administered via one-time intratumoral injection and activated by radiotherapy. Its proof-of-concept was achieved in soft tissue sarcomas for which the product received a European CE mark in 2019. The product candidate’s physical mechanism of action (MoA) is designed to induce significant tumor cell death in the injected tumor when activated by radiotherapy  subsequently triggering adaptive immune response and long-term anti-cancer memory. Given the physical MoA  Nanobiotix believes that NBTXR3 could be scalable across any solid tumor that can be treated with radiotherapy and across any therapeutic combination  particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors.Radiotherapy-activated NBTXR3 is being evaluated across multiple solid tumor indications as a single agent or in combination with anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors  including in NANORAY-312—a global  randomized phase III study in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell cancers. In February 2020  the United States Food and Drug Administration granted regulatory Fast Track designation for the investigation of NBTXR3 activated by radiation therapy  with or without cetuximab  for the treatment of patients with locally advanced HNSCC who are not eligible for platinum-based chemotherapy—the same population being evaluated in the phase III study.Given the Company’s focus areas  and balanced against the scalable potential of NBTXR3  Nanobiotix has engaged in a collaboration strategy to expand development of the product candidate in parallel with its priority development pathways. Pursuant to this strategy  in 2019 Nanobiotix entered into a broad  comprehensive clinical research collaboration with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center to sponsor several phase I and phase II studies evaluating NBTXR3 across tumor types and therapeutic combinations. In 2023 Nanobiotix announced a license agreement for the global co-development and commercialization of NBTXR3 with Janssen Pharmaceutica NV  a Johnson & Johnson company.About NANOBIOTIXNanobiotix is a late-stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering disruptive  physics-based therapeutic approaches to revolutionize treatment outcomes for millions of patients; supported by people committed to making a difference for humanity.

Digit…,"PRESS RELEASERelatech  through its subsidiary EFA Automazione SpA  acquires the distribution of the innovative IO-Link Master Fastus UR series modules of the Japanese Optex FAMilan  7 March 2024Relatech S.p.A.  Digital Enabler Solution Know-How (DESK) Company listed on the Euronext Growth Milan market (Ticker: RLT)  through EFA Automazione SpA  a company that has been active for over thirty years in the field of connectivity  industrial communication solutions and software platforms for system integration  part of the Relatech group  has signed a commercial collaboration agreement for the distribution in Italy of the Fastus IO-Link Master modules produced by the Japanese company Optex FA Co.  Ltd.Optex FA has forty years of experience in the automation market  with particular reference to the world of optoelectronics  a technological field that has seen it operate for many years in a joint-venture with a European company that is a world leader in the field of sensors. Today  with the IO-Link Master Fastus modules of the UR series  Optex FA continues in the wake of innovation  offering solutions for the interconnection of IO-Link devices that  unique in their kind  now land in Italy thanks to the sales network and technical support offered by EFA Automazione.The IO-Link Master Fastus of the UR series have technical characteristics that can be labeled as unique  starting from the minimum cycle time of only 0.3 ms  an exceptionally high-performance value that  compared to standard IO-Link masters (1-2 ms)  is about 6 times lower.Unlike other IO-Link master modules on the market  which allow up to 8 devices to be interconnected  the Optex FA UR series Fastus has twice as many channels  allowing up to 16 devices to be connected and thus optimizing costs and cabling. Its compact dimensions of only 110 x 63 x 45 mm (practically half the size of standard IO-Link master modules) make it a true champion of space  so much so that it can be mounted even in the smallest available crevices inside the panels or boxes distributed along the system.Created to offer the necessary connectivity between IO-Link and the rest of the world of industrial communication  the IO-Link Master Fastus of the UR series allow you to interfacewith all the main Ethernet-based industrial communication networks: Ethernet/IP  Profinet  CC-Link IE Field Basic  EtherCAT and Modbus TCP. It should be noted that the Modbus TCP protocol is always available even when used simultaneously with other fieldbuses  with the exception of EtherCAT  which does not use the standard TCP/IP stacks.Another unique feature of the Optex FA's IO-Link Master Fastus UR series is the ability to handle mixed-type signals. In addition to connecting sensors and actuators in IO-Link  it is possible to wire both PNP and NPN digital I/O  which makes them extremely flexible tools to connect almost all types of devices: light curtains  pressure  flow  temperature sensors  proximity sensors  solenoid valves  linear electric actuators  stepper motors  electro-pneumatic regulators  etc. An input can also be used for high-speed counting  e.g. for connecting incremental encoders up to 250 kHz.The module has a two-line OLED display which  together with a keypad  allows you to configure IO-Link master and device by choosing from 10 available languages  including Italian. Configuration operations are also facilitated by the ability of the Fastus UR modules to automatically download IODD (IO Device Description) files. When an IO-Link device is connected to an IO-Link master  the master requests the IODD file from the device. This automated process greatly simplifies the integration of IO-Link devices into the industrial automation system  reducing the complexity of manual intervention to configure devices. A convenient parameter back-up function allows the operation to be carried out in ""plug & play"" mode  i.e. without having to redo a new configuration and minimizing downtime  in the event that a device  such as a sensor  needs to be replaced.In addition to the IO-Link Master  Optex FA offers a number of IO-Link hubs. These devices allow you to extend the connection capacity up to 256 points  transforming the Fastus UR system into a communication backbone capable of collecting and sending a mix of analog and digital signals to the most popular Industrial Ethernet networks using modules with 16 digital inputs  16 digital outputs  8 inputs and 8 digital outputs  4 analog inputs and 4 analog outputs.Finally  JSON can be used to integrate data generated by IO-Link devices into larger systems  such as IoT platforms or web applications that need data in standard  high-level interoperable formats.The following is a summary of the main features of the IO-Link Master Fastus UR modules produced by Optex FA and distributed in Italy by EFA Automazione:1. Number of channels: 16 (highest currently available)2. Simultaneous management of IO-Link points  digital I/O (PNP and NPN)  and analog I/O3. Minimum cycle time: 0.3 ms (currently the fastest)4. Network interfaces: Modbus TCP  Ethernet/IP  Profinet  EtherCAT  CC-Link Field Basic5. Ultra-compact dimensions: 110 x 63 x 45 mm (about half of the solutions on the market)6. Availability of a dedicated input for fast counting (up to 250 kHz)7. Multi-language support  including English8. Automatic backup/restore function for plug-and-play replacement of IO-Link devices9. Automatic reading of IODD files10. Wide range of IO-Link hub modules (digital and analog I/O).CAPTIONS:1. In just 110 x 63 x 45 mm  the Optex FA UR series Fastus IO-Link modules  distributed in Italy by EFA Automazione (Relatech group)  have 16 channels.2. The Fastus UR series also features hubs to transparently manage PNP/NPN and analog digital signal mixes.***Relatech (ticker RLT ISIN IT0005433740)  Digital Enabler Solution Know-how (DESK) Company listed on the Euronext Growth Milan market since June 2019  has been active for over twenty years in Digital Enabler frontier technologies  such as Cloud  Cybersecurity  IoT  Big Data  Blockchain  Machine Learning.

Thanks to our unique expertise  we aim to accelerate our international expansion  in particular by promoting our luxury  sports  tourism  lifestyle  and cultural businesses to the widest possible audience.This momentum is made possible by the unfailing commitment of our teams and the trust placed in us by our clients. I would like to thank them in particular. ""Pierre-Franck Moley  Managing Director and Chair of the Board of Hopscotch Sopexa:""With its positive reputation  the power of the Hopscotch brand  and its financial resources  the group presents itself as a consolidator in the market  enabling it to aim for strong growth in the coming years.""An Expanding International GroupToday  HOPSCOTCH employs around 1 000 people  half of whom work internationally in EMEA  North America  and Asia. Thanks to a strong entrepreneurial culture that encourages initiative at all levels  the group is agile and responsive to respond to a rapidly changing market.Hopscotch's ability to integrate all communications activities under a single roof  and to benefit from a perfectly integrated international network  sets it apart from its competitors.Continued Business GrowthAs previously announced  the group's business is once again showing clear growth  thanks in particular to the continuing increase in events  but also to growth in the Public Relations and digital businesses. Positioned at the crossroads of the experiential and the influential  HOPSCOTCH is at the heart of its clients' communication needs.Gross margin reached 92.9 million euros  again a record high in the group's history.Solid OperationsWith operating conditions well under control  the group confirmed a favorable profit margin  with consolidated operating profit of 9.9 million euros and a gross margin of 92.9 million euros  or 10.7%. This good performance includes investments in prospecting and innovation (including AI) in preparation for 2024 and its major sporting and cultural events. As a result  personnel costs have risen slightly more than necessary to support growth in 2023. Normative earnings would easily have exceeded 10 million euros without these exceptional charges.Financial expenses were higher this year due to non-recurring entries (accounting charge of €850 thousand) relating to the rationalisation of the Group's legal structure and the deconsolidation of a discontinued business  as well as the renewal of the head office lease  which generated an accounting charge of €125 thousand in connection with IFRS 16.After net financial expense of -€2 665 thousand  and income taxes of -€1 992 thousand  net income came to €5 185 thousand  down slightly due to the temporary surcharge linked to the financial loss.Strongly Consolidated Financial StructureThe balance sheet structure has been consolidated  with shareholders' equity increasing to 31.5 million euros (28 million euros on December 31  2022).Financial debt excluding PGE (The French State Guaranteed Loan) amounted to 6.6 million euros  down 3.5 million euros on the previous year. At the same time  PGE (The French State Guaranteed Loan) debt fell by 4.4 million euros during the year  leaving a closing balance of 14.8 million euros.The cash position remains strongly positive at 42.2 million euros  including the unused EMP of 14.8 million euros.The net financial position is therefore positive and improving  at 20.8 million euros versus 14.8 million euros last year.The Executive Board therefore proposes to the Annual General Meeting of May 30  2024 to distribute a dividend of 0.65 euros per share  an increase of 30% (0.50 euros in 2023).2024 PerspectivesSince the release of Covid  the events business has seen a strong rebound  a structural phenomenon that responds to a need for physical meetings  whether B2C or B2B. At the same time  the growing complexity of communications  the impact of influencers and the associated reputational risk all call for greater expertise in mastering what companies have to say.We continue to see good momentum in activities linked to public relations and mastering reputational challenges (Social Media  Influence  Public Affairs  Public Relations  Content)  which has resulted in numerous gains in newbiz.In January 2024  Hopscotch finalized the acquisition of the 4 companies making up the Interface Tourism group in France  Spain  Italy and the Netherlands  which will become Hopscotch Interface Tourism.The transaction  half in cash and half in newly issued shares  will be accretive: in 2023  the gross margin generated by Hopscotch Interface Tourism will exceed 8 million euros  and the operating margin will exceed 15%.By consolidating the Tourism division in 2024  the Group's gross margin will exceed 100 million euros  and operating margin should improve.Thanks to its solid financial structure  the group will pursue its strategy of external growth  with an international focus  and continue to strengthen its position in growth areas such as influence  with  for example  the recent integration of a team of 12 specialized consultants.Hopscotch thus aims to become a leading communications group worldwide.CSRHOPSCOTCH has been fully committed to the ecological transition for over 15 years now  a conviction and mobilization recognized by numerous labels and certifications over the years (Agence Active label certification  and Ecovadis). The roup puts its experience and expertise to work for its clients  for whom these issues are becoming increasingly important. In this respect  HOPSCOTCH is mobilized to accompany changes in regulations  and more particularly the entry into force of the CSRD  which will necessarily give rise to needs in terms of responsible communication.AIHOPSCOTCH sees this technology as a way of making certain services more efficient and thus optimizing consulting value  but also as an opportunity to invent and offer new business lines. The group has invested in its own platform and set up a team of experts to keep abreast of technological developments. AI is already rightly integrated into many client operations.HOPSCOTCH Groupe will publish its turnover for Q1 2024 on May 2  2024  after market close.________Shareholder ContactPierre-Franck MOLEY - Directeur Général - Tel. 01 41 34 20 56 - pfmoley@hopscotchgroupe.comPress ContactJodie KNOEPFLER CONSCIENCE – Assistant to the Executive Board - Tel. 01 41 34 20 51 - jodiekc@hopscotchgroupe.com________About HOPSCOTCH GroupeHOPSCOTCH is an international communications group created in France and run by its founders and managers  all guided by an entrepreneurial vision driven by complementary expertise.

This April  Come a casa launches a 100% plant-based lasagne bolognese with the same delicious taste and affordability as their classic version  but with a remarkable 85% reduction in plastic packaging. Prior to its official release in Belgian supermarkets  a select group of consumers had the chance to taste the latest recipe without even realizing it.100% plant-based  85% less plastic packagingWith this brand new lasagne  Come a casa not only wants to appeal to vegans  but also to a much broader audience. In fact  research shows that 64% of Belgian consumers1 are trying to reduce their meat consumption. Why? For the environment  their health and animal welfare. However  they are faced with a challenge: how do you easily prepare a dish without meat and without compromising on taste? Come a casa wants to be the answer to that question.""As the market leader in Italian ready meals  we feel it is our responsibility to help consumers make more sustainable choices. That's why we are proud to introduce a plant-based version of one of Belgium's favourite dishes: a lasagne bolognese. Our lasagne consists of a rich bolognese sauce based on pea proteins and a creamy béchamel sauce based on lentils & cauliflower."" - Cédric Lemineur  Marketing & Development Director.The plant-based lasagne is not only more sustainable through the choice of ingredients  but also thanks to a pioneering step in packaging. Using innovative ""topseal"" technology  this lasagne is packaged with 85% less plastic than the majority of the Belgian lasagne market.""After years of research  testing and big technical adjustments in our factory  we are taking a big step in terms of sustainability with 'topseal'. Thanks to this new technology  a plastic film can be sealed directly onto the aluminium tray  good for 85% less plastic packaging. The plant-based lasagne is just the kick-off of a greener Come a casa."" said Cédric.Moreover  Come a casa wants to lower the threshold for sustainable consumption. By offering the lasagne at launch at a similar price to the brand's classic and beloved lasagne bolognese  it wants to make sustainable consumption a natural choice.Available from today at Carrefour and Colruyt  among others  at a recommended retail price at launch €4.25 - consumer price to be decided by the retailer itself.Come a casa temporarily became Casa CameoOn Tuesday 20 February  a brand new lasagneria opened its doors in Antwerp with affordable lasagnes for everyone: Casa Cameo. Or so many Antwerpers thought anyway... In fact  it was a so-called dark kitchen  a restaurant where cooking is done  but where you cannot eat on the spot. Ordering lasagnes was done via the Deliveroo and Uber Eats app. End of March  however  it turned out that Casa Cameo is actually an anagram for Come a casa. And all those delicious lasagnes that were brought to your home turned out to have been produced on the Come a casa sites in Marche-en-Famenne and Wanze. To top it all off  also the newest Lasagne Bolognese Plant-based could be tasted!1 Metrixlab 2023""At Come a casa  we believe that even if you don't have time or just don't want to cook  you can always count on our meals for a simple solution without compromising on taste. Our ready-made meals are put together with care  so you can effortlessly whip up a delicious meal on the table. With our dark kitchen stunt  we want to show that choosing a ready meal is also choosing a tasty experience."" said Margaux De Ridder  Brand Manager Come a casa.Some figures from the recent blind consumer test :• 564 Antwerp residents have tasted a lasagne or pasta.• 97% of the ""reviewers"" gave a taste score of at least 4/5.• The price also proved to be to their liking with 96% giving it a score of at least 4/5.• 100% would buy the lasagne/pasta again.A stunt to show that Come a casa's lasagnes - including the new plant-based variant - approach fresh homemade lasagnes in terms of taste and bite.

The TC4 has already been selected by one of our major customers and we envision a fast commercial take-off due to the ever-increasing demand in data processing acceleration solutions”  shares Eric Baissus  Kalray CEO.“In addition  we are very proud to announce that the TC4 is our first “made in France” product. The production is ramping up rapidly in the plant of the leading global manufacturer AsteelFlash in Langon”.BUILT TO COMBINE AI AND CLASSICAL COMPUTINGTC4 embodies Kalray's vision in addressing the intricate demands of modern computing workloads. Housing four of the latest generation of Kalray’s DPUs  Coolidge2TM  in a single PCIe card  Kalray’s TC4 is designed to ensure customers can merge classical and AI-based processing technologies and create superior  efficiency-driven systems for the most processing-intensive AI applications. DPUs offer a very complementary architecture to GPUs  allowing for the processing of a large number of different operations in parallel in an asynchronous way. DPUs are well-suited for pre-processing data that is later used by GPUs or in the context of complex intelligent systems running many different algorithms in parallel.TWO FAST GROWING MARKETS TARGETTED: THE SMART VISION MARKET…TC4 is strategically targeted at two rapidly growing markets. The first one is the Smart Vision market. Smart vision applications play a pivotal role in transformative sectors such as Industrial  Health Science  or Smart City operations due to their ability to analyze visual data in real-time  make intelligent decisions  and automate complex processes. The smart vision market size was valued at USD 20.31 billion in 2023 which is forecasted to reach USD 175.72 billion by 2032  exhibiting a CAGR of 27.3% ​ (Fortune Business Insights)​. These projections highlight the increasing demand of smart vision technologies across various industries  driven by advancements in AI and machine learning  and their application in automation  quality control  and enhanced operational efficiencies.…AND THE DATA-INDEXING FOR GEN-AI MARKETIn the context of Generative AI  data indexing is crucial for several reasons. Generative AI models  such as those used in natural language processing or image generation  often need to access enormous datasets. Efficient indexing minimizes the time required to fetch the relevant data  making the training and inference processes faster.In addition  as Generative AI models become more complex  the datasets they train on grow exponentially. Data indexing allows these models to scale more effectively by ensuring that the increase in data volume does not linearly increase access times.Data-Indexing also improves models’ outputs accuracy as indexing helps quickly identify the most relevant data pieces to insert in model context and prompt. This ensures that the model's outputs are as accurate and contextually appropriate as possible.TC4 PRODUCTION HAS BEEN RE-LOCATED TO ASTEELFLASH FRENCH PLANTKalray's commitment to quality and desire to re-locate its production to Europe led to the alliance with Asteelflash for TC4 production.

STRO-003  an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) in the final stages of pre-clinical development  targets the ROR1 tumor antigen which is known to be overexpressed in many different cancer types including solid tumors and hematological malignancies.1 The agreement gives Ipsen exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize STRO-003 and will be the first ADC candidate joining Ipsen’s expanding portfolio.“The potential for ADCs in oncology is well-documented and we are excited by the addition of STRO-003  Ipsen’s first ADC candidate with best-in-class potential.” said Mary Jane Hinrichs  SVP and Head of Early Development at Ipsen. “STRO-003 is a next-generation ROR1 ADC  leveraging Sutro’s site-specific technology to generate a highly stable conjugate  coupled with exatecan payloads  that have shown significant potential in solid tumors. This is our focus as we prepare to enter Phase I  harnessing Ipsen’s global expertise in oncology development  while also reinforcing our commitment to bringing new medicines to patients with few treatment options.”“We are excited to partner STRO-003 with Ipsen to help us reach more patients faster while retaining significant downstream participation in a medicine in which we believe ” said Jane Chung  President and Chief Operating Officer at Sutro. “Sutro’s research innovation represented in STRO-003 illustrates our leadership in ADC design. We look forward to collaborating with Ipsen’s impressive oncology development team to bring a differentiated ROR1-targeted ADC to patients.”ADCs are comprised of three main components: the antibody  payload and linker. The antibody selectively targets an identified tumor antigen  such as ROR1. Payloads are the pharmaceutically active component to treat the cancer  attached to the antibody via a chemical linker. The linker connects the antibody and the payload and reduces the amount of payload that reaches non-tumor tissue.2Under the terms of the agreement  Ipsen will assume responsibility for Phase I preparation activities  including submission of the Investigational New Drug (IND) application  and all subsequent clinical-development activities and global commercialization activities. Sutro Biopharma is eligible to receive up to $900m in potential upfront  development  regulatory and commercial milestone payments including approximately $90m in near-term payments  including an equity investment  and tiered royalties on global sales  contingent upon successful development and commercialization.ENDSAbout IpsenWe are a global biopharmaceutical company with a focus on bringing transformative medicines to patients in three therapeutic areas: Oncology  Rare Disease and Neuroscience.Our pipeline is fueled by external innovation and supported by nearly 100 years of development experience and global hubs in the U.S.  France and the U.K. Our teams in more than 40 countries and our partnerships around the world enable us to bring medicines to patients in more than 80 countries.Ipsen is listed in Paris (Euronext: IPN) and in the U.S. through a Sponsored Level I American Depositary Receipt program (ADR: IPSEY).

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.

This contract  with the Department of Health and Human Services; Administration for Strategic Preparedness and Response; BARDA under contract number 75A50122C00031  includes up to $32 million for the advanced development of ZEPIZURE® through approval by the FDA for the treatment of status epilepticus seizures in adults and children over the age of 2. It also includes the procurement of $60 million of ZEPIZURE® to the U.S. Government once it has received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the FDA. These proceeds will contribute in a timely fashion to the deployment of ZEPIZURE® in epilepsy markets.During recent interactions with the FDA  we have achieved better visibility on the next development steps for the U.S. regulatory pathway. We estimate that a response from FDA regarding the EUA will be received during Q1 2025.In parallel  we expect to file in H1 2025 for an NDA of ZEPIZURE®. We are firmly focused on the final development stages for epileptic crises  including an upcoming 505(b)(2) pivotal bioequivalence study  as part of the NDA that we anticipate to file in H1 2025. We are also working on activities related to its registration and pre-commercialization in the United States  since Crossject intends to retain U.S. commercial rights to ZEPIZURE®. We have been working in close collaboration with Syneos Health  a leading contract research  market access and commercialization services organization  which we engaged in January. Together  we are working with the aim to ensure a smooth and rapid launch of ZEPIZURE® upon receiving regulatory approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).We intend to file our NDA application for the Status Epilepticus indication under FDA’s 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway.. This is a streamlined NDA process in which we can rely on investigations previously conducted by third parties for an FDA approved reference product  and where we will only need to demonstrate bioequivalence with such a product. In our upcoming pivotal study  we intend to replicate the comprehensive positive bioequivalence results already demonstrated in our precedent study released on 2 November 2022  which will be used for the EUA. In this randomized crossover study  ZEPIZURE® demonstrated bioequivalence to a predicate injectable marketed in Europe. Based on these and other data  we are confident that the ZENEO® platform will continue to demonstrate its ability to mimic intramuscular injections from traditional injectables with a high accuracy and low variability. These ZENEO features  now well validated  will be essential to limit development and regulatory risks. More importantly  we also expect them to drive market acceptance versus traditional injectables  and versus other delivery methods  including intranasals  which are known for their intrinsic transmucosal pharmacokinetic variability  compounding with the admnistration challenges customarily incurred during crises.Our market opportunity has been validated by the relative success of such intranasal products  promoted as “needle free”. We look forward to reaching the market with our first unique solution in epilepsy  that is dependable and addresses the limitations of currently marketed products.Our two main additional programs  ZENEO® Hydrocortisone and ZENEO® Adrenaline  are also progressing toward planned market authorization filings in 2025 and 2026 respectively.The supply chain organization  including our new partner Eurofins Scientific as fill-and-finish CDMO (Contract Development and Manufacturing Organization)  was discussed with BARDA and the FDA. Although it has led to further delay  we firmly believe that  today  our level of automation will not only strengthen our supply chain but also further secure the anticipated volumes for all our programs.This combination of positive developments has served as a strong background for the continued strengthening of our balance-sheet  recently achieved through our €12 million financing with Heights Capital Management. As ZEPIZURE® progresses toward market authorizations  and as we also support our two main additional programs  we will continue to actively explore the best way to finance our maturing global operations throughout the rest of 2024.Philippe Monnot  CEO and one of the founders of Gemmes Venture  our reference shareholder  has confirmed his support :« With the recent evolutions in Crossject’s supply chain and the constructive interactions with the FDA we trust that the Company can market its revolutionary products; we renew our trust in the Company and its management. »I am grateful to you  our shareholders  for your unwavering attention and your continuing support of our efforts. Together  we have the opportunity to make a significant difference for patients and create value for our company.Financials for 2023Key financial information as of December 31  2023In 2023  we continued the financing of the development ZEPIZURE® and of the rest of our pipeline and infrastructure through multiple sources:BARDA invoicing: $6.7 million were invoiced as reimbursements of research and development expenses incurred in 2023  versus $1.8 million in 2022;Invoicing to distributor: € 145 thousand were collected as upfront payment upon signing of the agreement with AFT Pharmaceuticals  Ltd;Research tax credit: €2.4 million were collected in 2023 versus €2.0 million in 2022.Real estate leaseback transaction : €4.7 million were raised through a sale and leaseback transaction for two of its buildings with leasing payments spread over the following 12 years;Borrowings: 8 million proceeds from loans contracted in 2022 were collected.Convertible Bonds: All outstanding convertible bonds had been converted as of 31/12/2023.In 2023  we accelerated our research and development and overall activities. As a result  we recorded a very substantial increase in operating income to €12.8 million  an increase of 32% over 2022.The table below summarizes our income statement for the years ending 31 December 2023 and 2022:€ thousands  as of 31 December 2023 2022 Operating income 12 826 9 718 Operating expenses -25 126 -23 005 Purchase of raw materials and supplies -1 595 -498 Other purchases and external expenses -8 869 -8 116 Personal expenses -7 713 -7 424 Taxes and duties -267 -176 Depreciation  amortisation and provision -6 185 -6 358 Other expenses -494 -433 Operating profit/loss -12 300 -13 288 Financial income/expense -497 -319 Exceptional income/expense 1 463 228 Corporate tax 2 867 2 222 Net profit/loss -8 467 -11 157The Operating expenses increased by 9% in 2023 over 2022  a very moderate rise in relation to the increase of our operating income. Such increase resulted from our advancing in the research and development of ZEPIZURE and of our other programs as well as from the initial steps in building our US team and operations.Other purchases and external expenses amounted to €8.9 million  compared with €8.1 million in 2022  as we have been maintaining the progress in our production work and third-party activities linked to the regulatory development of ZEPIZURE® as well as activities on other key programs in our pipeline.As of 31 December 2023  Crossject had approximately 111 employees  an 11% increase compared with 2022. Personnel expenses amounted to €7.7 million in 2023 compared to €7.4 million in 2022  the increase is due to these new recruitments in 2023.We reported an Operating loss of €12.3 million  compared with a loss of €13.3 million in 2022 with the relative stability reflecting our increased operating expenses and their partial offsetting by operating income.We recorded net financial expenses of €0.5 million for 2023  compared to an expense of €0.3 million for 2022.After taking into account an exceptional income of €1.5 million  provided primarily from the transaction of the real estate leaseback and a reversal of accounting provision  as well as the research tax credit for an amount of €2.9 million  we are reporting a Net loss for 2023 of €8.5 million versus a loss of €11.2 million in 2022.Treasury positionAs of 31 December 2023  we had a cash balance of €2.3 million.From the beginning of 2024 we have made it a priority to explore all types of financings to pursue our research and development and overall activities. As of 28 February 2024  we raised a first financing of up to €12 million from Heights Capital Management  in two tranches  with the first tranche of €7 million extended at closing.

The production is ramping up rapidly in the plant of the leading global manufacturer AsteelFlash in Langon”.BUILT TO COMBINE AI AND CLASSICAL COMPUTINGTC4 embodies Kalray's vision in addressing the intricate demands of modern computing workloads. Housing four of the latest generation of Kalray's DPUs  Coolidge2TM  in a single PCIe card  Kalray's TC4 is designed to ensure customers can merge classical and AI-based processing technologies and create superior  efficiency-driven systems for the most processing-intensive AI applications. DPUs offer a very complementary architecture to GPUs  allowing for the processing of a large number of different operations in parallel in an asynchronous way. DPUs are well-suited for pre-processing data that is later used by GPUs or in the context of complex intelligent systems running many different algorithms in parallel.TWO FAST GROWING MARKETs TARGETTED: THE SMART VISION MARKET…TC4 is strategically targeted at two rapidly growing markets. The first one is the Smart Vision market. Smart vision applications play a pivotal role in transformative sectors such as Industrial  Health Science  or Smart City operations due to their ability to analyze visual data in real-time  make intelligent decisions  and automate complex processes. The smart vision market size was valued at USD 20.31 billion in 2023 which is forecasted to reach USD 175.72 billion by 2032  exhibiting a CAGR of 27.3% (Fortune Business Insights). These projections highlight the increasing demand of smart vision technologies across various industries  driven by advancements in AI and machine learning  and their application in automation  quality control  and enhanced operational efficiencies.…AND THE DATA-INDEXING FOR GEN-AI MARKETIn the context of Generative AI  data indexing is crucial for several reasons. Generative AI models  such as those used in natural language processing or image generation  often need to access enormous datasets. Efficient indexing minimizes the time required to fetch the relevant data  making the training and inference processes faster.In addition  as Generative AI models become more complex  the datasets they train on grow exponentially. Data indexing allows these models to scale more effectively by ensuring that the increase in data volume does not linearly increase access times.Data-Indexing also improves models' outputs accuracy as indexing helps quickly identify the most relevant data pieces to insert in model context and prompt. This ensures that the model's outputs are as accurate and contextually appropriate as possible.TC4 PRODUCTION HAS BEEN RE-LOCATED TO ASTEELFLASH FRENCH PLANTKalray's commitment to quality and desire to re-locate its production to Europe led to the alliance with Asteelflash for TC4 production.

(Euronext Growth Paris: ALTME)  a biotechnology company focused on developing novel therapies for treatment of cancer by targeting the tumor microenvironment (TME)  announces that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Fast Track designation for NOX-A12 (olaptesed pegol)  TME Pharma's CXCL12 inhibitor  in combination with radiotherapy and bevacizumab for use in the treatment of the aggressive adult brain cancer  glioblastoma  in the newly diagnosed setting where the tumor is resistant to chemotherapy and measurable tumor remains after surgery.The FDA’s Fast Track designation aims to bring important new drugs to patients more quickly  facilitating the development and expediting the review of therapies intended to treat serious conditions and address unmet medical needs. Companies whose programs are granted Fast Track designation can benefit from more frequent interactions with the FDA during the clinical development process and potentially “accelerated approval” and “priority review” if the relevant criteria are met.TME Pharma continuously evaluates ways to advance the clinical development of NOX-A12 while remaining focused on identifying and securing financial resources from multiple sources  including those having no or minimal dilutive effect on its shareholders  such as governmental grants or free supply of combination drugs. In addition to engaging with industry partners and specialized healthcare investors  TME Pharma will also explore the eligibility of NOX-A12-based therapy for compassionate use programs once sufficient Phase 2 data have been generated. The company would prioritize such programs that support financial compensation for therapies leading to revenue generation  thus potentially reducing the financial needs of late-stage clinical development and also helping to generate real-world clinical evidence.Recently announced clearance by the FDA of TME Pharma's Investigational New Drug (IND) application for a Phase 2 study with NOX-A12 in glioblastoma  that the company plans to initiate later this year  was a prerequisite to having Fast Track designation granted by the FDA. Having Fast Track designation in addition to an open IND with an FDA-approved study design that addresses questions of dosing and contribution of components optimizes late phase development and offers an economically efficient model which further de-risks TME Pharma's glioblastoma program. Following IND approval  this Fast Track designation is an external validation of NOX-A12’s potential to address the unmet need for glioblastoma patients.The necessary preparatory steps for the NOX-A12 Phase 2 in glioblastoma are ongoing  and TME Pharma is aiming to initiate the new Phase 2 study as soon as the necessary resources from financial and industrial partners have been secured. TME Pharma is prioritizing discussions with partners willing to support the company over the long term and having their financial interests aligned with current stakeholders. While discussions are ongoing  and until longer-term agreements with partners are reached  TME Pharma is determined to keep operational costs low to extend the financial visibility as far as possible and increase the chance of success.TME Pharma's latest regulatory milestones were supported by recent survival data from the GLORIA Phase 1/2 study in which NOX-A12 demonstrated an unprecedented median Overall Survival of 19.9 months in chemotherapy resistant patients with residual tumor after surgery  which compared very favorably to a matched standard of care reference cohort and exceeds what TME Pharma believes to be all relevant competitor therapy trials in newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients resistant to standard chemotherapy.""At the start of this year  we announced the next phase of our development of NOX-A12 by targeting IND approval and an expedited regulatory pathway in the US and we are very proud to have successfully achieved these milestones within the timeframe we set out "" said Aram Mangasarian  CEO of TME Pharma. ""While advancing discussions with potential industrial and financial partners may require some time to materialize  the open IND and Fast Track designation awarded by the FDA are well-received signals by these partners. We now have a clear clinical development roadmap with which to take NOX-A12 forward in the treatment of glioblastoma and to support engagement with potential partners. We expect our new Phase 2 study will build on the unprecedented results of our GLORIA trial  which strengthens the potential of NOX-A12 to become the treatment option of choice for newly diagnosed chemotherapy-resistant glioblastoma. We look forward to working closely with the FDA as we advance NOX-A12 to market as quickly as possible for the benefit of patients suffering from this devastating and aggressive cancer for which there is extremely poor prognosis.""About TME PharmaTME Pharma is a clinical-stage company focused on developing novel therapies for treatment of the most aggressive cancers. The company’s oncology-focused pipeline is designed to act on the tumor microenvironment (TME) and the cancer immunity cycle by breaking tumor protection barriers against the immune system and blocking tumor repair. By neutralizing chemokines in the TME  TME Pharma’s approach works in combination with other forms of treatment to weaken tumor defenses and enable greater therapeutic impact. In the GLORIA clinical trial  TME Pharma is studying its lead drug candidate NOX-A12 in newly diagnosed brain cancer patients who will not benefit clinically from standard chemotherapy. TME Pharma has delivered top-line data from the NOX-A12 three dose-escalation cohorts combined with radiotherapy of the GLORIA clinical trial  observing consistent tumor reductions and objective tumor responses. Additionally  GLORIA expansion arms evaluate safety and efficacy of NOX-A12 in other combinations where the interim results from the triple combination of NOX-A12  radiotherapy and bevacizumab suggest even deeper and more durable responses  and improved survival. NOX-A12 in combination with radiotherapy has received orphan drug designation for glioblastoma in the United States and glioma in Europe. TME Pharma has delivered final top-line data with encouraging overall survival and safety profile from its NOX-A12 combination trial with Keytruda® in metastatic colorectal and pancreatic cancer patients  which was published in the Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer in October 2021. The company has entered in its second collaboration with MSD/Merck for its Phase 2 study  OPTIMUS  to further evaluate safety and efficacy of NOX-A12 in combination with Merck’s Keytruda® and two different chemotherapy regimens as second-line therapy in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. The design of the trial has been approved in France  Spain and the United States. The company’s second clinical-stage drug candidate  NOX-E36  is designed to target the innate immune system. TME Pharma is considering several solid tumors for further clinical development.

(Euronext Growth Paris: AL™E)  a biotechnology company focused on developing novel therapies for treatment of cancer by targeting the tumor microenvironment (™E)  announces that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted Fast Track designation for NOX-A12 (olaptesed pegol)  ™E Pharma's CXCL12 inhibitor  in combination with radiotherapy and bevacizumab for use in the treatment of the aggressive adult brain cancer  glioblastoma  in the newly diagnosed setting where the tumor is resistant to chemotherapy and measurable tumor remains after surgery.The FDA's Fast Track designation aims to bring important new drugs to patients more quickly  facilitating the development and expediting the review of therapies intended to treat serious conditions and address unmet medical needs. Companies whose programs are granted Fast Track designation can benefit from more frequent interactions with the FDA during the clinical development process and potentially accelerated approval and priority review if the relevant criteria are met.™E Pharma continuously evaluates ways to advance the clinical development of NOX-A12 while remaining focused on identifying and securing financial resources from multiple sources  including those having no or minimal dilutive effect on its shareholders  such as governmental grants or free supply of combination drugs. In addition to engaging with industry partners and specialized healthcare investors  ™E Pharma will also explore the eligibility of NOX-A12-based therapy for compassionate use programs once sufficient Phase 2 data have been generated. The company would prioritize such programs that support financial compensation for therapies leading to revenue generation  thus potentially reducing the financial needs of late-stage clinical development and also helping to generate real-world clinical evidence.Recently announced clearance by the FDA of ™E Pharma's Investigational New Drug (IND) application for a Phase 2 study with NOX-A12 in glioblastoma  that the company plans to initiate later this year  was a prerequisite to having Fast Track designation granted by the FDA. Having Fast Track designation in addition to an open IND with an FDA-approved study design that addresses questions of dosing and contribution of components optimizes late phase development and offers an economically efficient model which further de-risks ™E Pharma's glioblastoma program. Following IND approval  this Fast Track designation is an external validation of NOX-A12's potential to address the unmet need for glioblastoma patients.The necessary preparatory steps for the NOX-A12 Phase 2 in glioblastoma are ongoing  and ™E Pharma is aiming to initiate the new Phase 2 study as soon as the necessary resources from financial and industrial partners have been secured. ™E Pharma is prioritizing discussions with partners willing to support the company over the long term and having their financial interests aligned with current stakeholders. While discussions are ongoing  and until longer-term agreements with partners are reached  ™E Pharma is determined to keep operational costs low to extend the financial visibility as far as possible and increase the chance of success.™E Pharma's latest regulatory milestones were supported by recent survival data from the GLORIA Phase 1/2 study in which NOX-A12 demonstrated an unprecedented median Overall Survival of 19.9 months in chemotherapy resistant patients with residual tumor after surgery  which compared very favorably to a matched standard of care reference cohort and exceeds what ™E Pharma believes to be all relevant competitor therapy trials in newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients resistant to standard chemotherapy.""At the start of this year  we announced the next phase of our development of NOX-A12 by targeting IND approval and an expedited regulatory pathway in the US and we are very proud to have successfully achieved these milestones within the timeframe we set out "" said Aram Mangasarian  CEO of ™E Pharma. ""While advancing discussions with potential industrial and financial partners may require some time to materialize  the open IND and Fast Track designation awarded by the FDA are well-received signals by these partners. We now have a clear clinical development roadmap with which to take NOX-A12 forward in the treatment of glioblastoma and to support engagement with potential partners. We expect our new Phase 2 study will build on the unprecedented results of our GLORIA trial  which strengthens the potential of NOX-A12 to become the treatment option of choice for newly diagnosed chemotherapy-resistant glioblastoma. We look forward to working closely with the FDA as we advance NOX-A12 to market as quickly as possible for the benefit of patients suffering from this devastating and aggressive cancer for which there is extremely poor prognosis.""About ™E Pharma™E Pharma is a clinical-stage company focused on developing novel therapies for treatment of the most aggressive cancers. The company's oncology-focused pipeline is designed to act on the tumor microenvironment (™E) and the cancer immunity cycle by breaking tumor protection barriers against the immune system and blocking tumor repair. By neutralizing chemokines in the ™E  ™E Pharma's approach works in combination with other forms of treatment to weaken tumor defenses and enable greater therapeutic impact. In the GLORIA clinical trial  ™E Pharma is studying its lead drug candidate NOX-A12 in newly diagnosed brain cancer patients who will not benefit clinically from standard chemotherapy. ™E Pharma has delivered top-line data from the NOX-A12 three dose-escalation cohorts combined with radiotherapy of the GLORIA clinical trial  observing consistent tumor reductions and objective tumor responses. Additionally  GLORIA expansion arms evaluate safety and efficacy of NOX-A12 in other combinations where the interim results from the triple combination of NOX-A12  radiotherapy and bevacizumab suggest even deeper and more durable responses  and improved survival. NOX-A12 in combination with radiotherapy has received orphan drug designation for glioblastoma in the United States and glioma in Europe. ™E Pharma has delivered final top-line data with encouraging overall survival and safety profile from its NOX-A12 combination trial with Keytruda ® in metastatic colorectal and pancreatic cancer patients  which was published in the Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer in October 2021. The company has entered in its second collaboration with MSD/Merck for its Phase 2 study  OPTIMUS  to further evaluate safety and efficacy of NOX-A12 in combination with Merck's Keytruda ® and two different chemotherapy regimens as second-line therapy in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. The design of the trial has been approved in France  Spain and the United States. The company's second clinical-stage drug candidate  NOX-E36  is designed to target the innate immune system. ™E Pharma is considering several solid tumors for further clinical development.

EBITDA margin rises sharply to 48.7%  from 29.4% in 2022  an increase of over 20 points. This increase is the result of concomitant improvements in EBITDA margin rates for Energy Sales and Services.Normalised EBITDA  calculated at an average annual EUR/BRL exchange rate of 6.3 and with wind  solar and hydro production in line with the long-term average  comes to 271 million euros.Net income  Group share  is at 29.6 million euros  compared with a loss of 7.2 million euros in 2022  benefiting from the sharp rise in EBITDA.REVIEW OF ACTIVITIESEnergy SalesFinancial indicatorsIn € million 2023 2022 Change at current exchange rates Change at constant exchange rates5 Turnover 299.3 242.4 +23% +23% EBITDA 194.6 143.3 +36% +36% EBITDA margin 65% 59% +6pts +6ptsOperational indicators 2023 2022 Change Load Factors6 Long-term average (Voltalia) Long-term average (national) Production (in GWh) 4 336 3 680 +18% Capacity in operation (in MW)7 2 370 1 571 +51% Capacity in operation and under construction (in MW) 2 851 2 592 +10% Wind load factor in Brazil 41% 42% -1pt 53% 39% Solar load factor in Brazil 27% 24%8 +3pts 34% 25% Wind load factor in France 26% 22% +4pts 24% 26% Solar load factor in France 16% 18% -2pts 17% 14% Solar load factor in Egypt & Jordan 24% 25% -1pt 23% naProduction reaches 4.3 TWh  up +18%  representing the electricity consumption of 5.5 million people. The increase is mainly coming from higher capacity of power plants currently in operation. Operating capacity rises from 1.6 GW to 2.4 GW (+51%) thanks to the commissioning of SSM3-6 and Canudos in Brazil  Garrido in Portugal  Karavasta in Albania  Sud Vannier and Rives Charentaises in France  and numerous decentralized production units owned by Helexia in France  Belgium  Portugal  Spain  Italy  Romania  Hungary and Brazil. These commissioning reach a record volume of 795 MW  including 662 MW in the second half of the year. They make a significant contribution to 2023  without a full-year impact yet  especially for the 662 MW commissioned end of 2023.Turnover from Energy Sales amounts to 299.3 million euros  up sharply by +23% (at current and constant exchange rates) thanks to higher electricity production and the contractual indexation of sales prices to inflation. Turnover mainly comes from the long-term power sales contracts  to which 98% of power plants in operation are linked.The weighted average residual term of all these contracts is 17.1 years (+7 months)  representing 8 billion euros of future sales under contract.74% of 2023 turnover from long-term power sales contracts is contractually indexed to inflation.This data illustrates Voltalia's investment strategy. In a market where there are speculative opportunities for electricity sales contracts much shorter than 20 years  and/or whose selling prices are not indexed to inflation  Voltalia continues to retain  after developing them  projects that meet its criteria  while selling other projects to third parties and providing construction and maintenance services for them.EBITDA generated by Energy Sales rises sharply to 194.6 million euros (+36% at current and constant exchange rates). EBITDA margin stands at 65%  an improvement of 6 points  primarily driven by enhanced performance of the portfolio of power plants already in operation in 2022  by contributions from new plants  some of which benefit from high prices during the initial months of operation  and by the increasing relative weight of solar in the portfolio  which EBITDA margin is on average higher than wind’s. In 2023  EBITDA would have been €34 million higher if solar  wind and hydro production had been at the long-term average.ServicesIn € million9 2023 2022 Change at current exchange rates Change at constant exchange rates Turnover before eliminations 601.9 351.3 +71% +72% Eliminations -406.4 -127.6 x3.2 x3.2 Turnover (after eliminations) 195.5 223.7 -12% -12% EBITDA (after eliminations) 62.1 9.1 x6.8 x6.9 EBITDA margin 32% 4% +28pts +28pts2023 turnover from Services (internal and external services) comes to 601.9 million euros  up +71% (+72% at constant exchange rates).Internal activity (eliminated when consolidated) grows strongly (x3.2).

With a smaller proportion of allocated resources  external business with third-party customers falls by -12% (at current and constant exchange rates). Turnover10 in the Development  Construction and Equipment Procurement segment falls by -16% to 172.6 million euros. Turnover in the Operation and Maintenance segment accelerate its grow  up +25% to 23.1 million euros.EBITDA generated by the Services business  after elimination of internal margins  is multiplied by x6.8 to reach €62.1 million  giving an EBITDA margin of 32%  an improvement of 28 points compared with 2022.EBITDA for the Development  Construction and Equipment Procurement for third-party customers segment increases 8.1-fold to €59.6 million. It is driven by Development  with the sale of projects of over 800 MW  mostly projects in the final stages of development sold with construction and maintenance services. These mainly concerned sites in Brazil (420 MW to Newave Energia  90 MW to Toda  59 MW to XP Asset Management) and France (33 MW to MER). EBITDA is also supported by Construction and Equipment Procurement. Despite the decrease in solar panel prices that impacts certain margins  EBITDA continues to grow thanks to projects from sites developed and then divested and those not related to Development  mainly in Ireland (337 MW solar under contract for local developers Bord na Mona and Power Capital)  Mauritania (42 MW solar and 18 MW / 9 MWh of battery storage for the Canadian miner Kinross) and France (9 MW solar with the Kourou Space Center) and  through Helexia  various contracts for clients such as SNCF  Guinot  or Vishay.EBITDA for the Operation and Maintenance segment for third party rises by 48% to 2.4 million euros. This is driven by contracts for third-party customers  which include construction and maintenance  as well as by pure maintenance contracts  which reaches record levels in 2023  notably in Spain (including 347 MW for the construction company OHLA) and Brazil (including 212 MW for the oil company BP).OTHER ITEMS OF THE INCOME STATEMENTIn € million 2023 2022 Change at current exchange rates Change at constant exchange rates EBITDA before eliminations and corporate 256.7 152.5 +68% +68% Eliminations and corporate -15.6 -15.3 +2% +2% EBITDA 241.1 137.2 +76% +76% Depreciation  amortization  and provisions -103.7 -73.9 +40% +40% Other non-current income and expenses -18.2 -7.6 x2.4 x2.4 Operating revenue (EBIT) 119.3 55.7 x2.1 x2.1 Financial result11 -57.9 -44.9 +29% +32% Taxes and net income of equity affiliates -36.3 -18.1 x2.0 x2.0 Minority interests 4.5 0.2 na na Net result (Group share) 29.6 -7.2 na naCorporate items are well under control (+2%) despite very strong business growth.EBITDA amounts to 241.1 million euros  up 76% (at current and constant exchange rates).Depreciation  amortization  and provisions amount to 103.7 million euros  up +40% (at current and constant exchange rates). The increase stems from: (i) 18 million euros from power plants commissioned and the full-year effect of power plants commissioned in 2022  and (ii) 9 million euros from depreciation and provisions mainly due to inventories of solar panels destroyed in a fire or depreciated with the fall in market prices.Other non-current income and expenses amount to -18.2 million euros. The increase (x2.4) mainly comes from (i) charges associated with the exceptional regulatory measures adopted in France (infra-marginal tax) and Portugal to limit and offset the rise in electricity prices following the invasion of Ukraine  and (ii) a base effect arising from the reversal of a provision in 2022 on the sale of a building in Portugal.The net financial result amounts to -57.9 million euros. The increase (+29% at current exchange rates and +32% at constant exchange rates) is mainly attributable to the debt of the power plants commissioned in 2023 and the full-year effect of those commissioned in 2022. Additionally  the Group's consolidated average overall interest rate on debt stands at 5.9% compared to 5.3% in 2022  primarily due to (i) increases in base rates on short-term drawdowns from revolving facilities and (ii) increases in swap rates on new project financings above historical averages. However  this latter increase is offset by the rise in unit selling prices for the corresponding assets. Credit margins  on the other hand  remain generally stable.Income tax expense amounts to 36.312 million euros  this increase (x2 at current and constant exchange rates) is mainly explained by (i) the growth of the power plant portfolio and its improved profitability  accounting for 8 million euros  and (ii) the taxation related to projects sold during the fiscal year  amounting to 6 million eurosNet result  Group share  is at 29.6 million euros  compared with -7.2 million euros in 2022  boosted by strong EBITDA growth.SIMPLIFIED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETThe balance sheet at the end of 2023 reaches 3.8 billion euros  an increase of +26%.In € million 2023 2022 Goodwill 79 87 Tangible and intangible fixed assets 2 771 2 074 Cash and cash equivalents 319 384 Other current and non-current assets 649 491 Total assets 3 818 3 035 Equity  Group share 1 265 1 232 Minorities 118 107 Financial debt 1 909 1 313 Provisions 34 26 Other current and non-current liabilities 492 357 Total liabilities 3 818 3 035Tangible and intangible fixed assets amounts to 2 771 million euros. The increase of +697 million euros (+33%) mainly reflects the growth in the portfolio of power plants in operation and under construction  with a capacity of 2 370 MW of power plants in operation by the end of 2023 (up 51%) and 480 MW of power plants under construction (down -53%).Other current and non-current assets increase by +158 million euros  close to the increase in other current and non-current liabilities (+135 million euros). The growth in other current and non-current assets is mainly explained by the increase in Services’ activity  in particular Development and Construction.The cash has a strong position at 319 million euros. It decreases  down -17%  mainly due to the temporary consumption of cash from some power plant projects whose construction was accelerated before the finalization of their long-term loans  in order to take advantage of attractive electricity sales prices in Europe.The equity  group share amounts to almost 1.3 billion euros  with an increase over the period mainly corresponding to the result of the year.Financial debt amounts to 1 909 million euros as of end of 2023  up +45% reflecting the growth of the power plant portfolio. The increase in financial debt in 2023 (up by +596 million euros) is lower than the fixed assets ones’ (by 697 million euros)  the balance being financed by the cash flows generated  and by part of the available cash  resulting in a 53% debt ratio13. 74% of its outstanding financial debt is fixed rates  hedged or indexed to inflation. It is 67% denominated in euros and 27% in Brazilian real.Other current and non-current liabilities amounts to 492 million euros  up +38%. This increase is mainly due to (i) an increase in trade payables from power plant construction and operation activities and (ii) changes in the value of financial instruments (derivative instruments).NEW ANNOUNCEMENTSResidual duration of electricity sales contracts 17.1 yearsVoltalia announces today that its long-term visibility has further improved. The average residual term of its power sales contracts has increased to 17.1 years at the end of 2023 (compared to 16.5 years as of end of 2022)  with 8 billion euros of future revenues under contract.New record for the portfolio of projects under development at 16.6 GWVoltalia announces today that its portfolio of projects under development  intended to be retained or sold with construction and maintenance services  amounted to 16.6 GW at the end of December 2023  up 17%. This includes 1.2 GW of projects secured by long-term power sales contracts.Update on the Brazilian power grid: favourable legal decisionAs announced in September 2023  the grid operator capped production at certain power plants following the blackout on August 15. This reduced Voltalia's 2023 output by around 350 GWh  according to the regulator. Since the beginning of 2024  curtailment has been low.Wind and solar associations  including Voltalia and others such as AES  Enel  EDPR and Neoenergia  filed a lawsuit seeking financial compensation from the grid operator. The plaintiffs were awarded almost full reimbursement of their production losses  but the grid has requested a review of this decision  and the rest of the proceedings could drag on for a long time. In this context  and even though Voltalia considers it likely  the recovery of its damages has not been entered in its 2023 accounts.2023 TARGETS MET OR EXCEEDEDCapacity in operation and under construction stands at 2.85 GW at the end of 2023  11% higher than the target of 2.6 GW announced in July 2019.Normalised EBITDA14 stands at 271 million euros in 2023  reaching the target announced in September 2023. The difference between 241 million euros in reported EBITDA and 271 million euros in normalised EBITDA is due to: neutralization of the difference between actual electricity production and wind  solar and hydro the long-term average production for +34 million euros; and neutralization of the gap between actual and normalised 2023 exchange rates for -4 million euros.In four years  capacity in operation and under construction has increased by a x2.7 factor (+28% p.a. CAGR15)  Turnover by a x3.3 factor (+35% p.a.)  EBITDA by a x3.7 factor (+44% p.a.) and net income  Group share  by a x6.4 factor (+59% p.a.).These increases performed while the Group  in line with its ambition set in 2019  diversified geographically  with a secured capacity16 of 4.1 GW distributed as follows: 46% in Europe  43% in Latin America and 11% in Africa.NEW 2024 OBJECTIVESVoltalia announces today new 2024 targets which anticipate a further increase in its capacity and EBITDA.Capacity in operation and under construction of around 3.3 GW  up +16% on 2023  including around 2.5 GW in operation.EBITDA of approximately 255 million euros  up +6% on 2023  including around €230 million from Energy Sales.CONFIRMED AND SPECIFIED 2027 OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL OBJECTIVESVoltalia confirms and specifies its operational and financial objectives for 2027  i.e.:Capacity in operation and under construction: over 5 GW (confirmation)  with approximately 4.2 GW in operation (specification).Capacity operated on behalf of third parties: over 8 GW (confirmation).Normalised EBITDA17: approximately 475 million euros (confirmation)  including Energy Sales EBITDA of around 430 million euros (specification).Voltalia would like to detail the sensitivity of the EUR/BRL exchange rate and the level of production:With an assumption that would shift the EUR/BRL exchange rate by plus or minus 1.0  the impact on the EBITDA reported in 2027 would be approximately +35 million euros (rate of 4.5 compared to a normative rate of 5.5) or -25 million euros (rate of 6.5 compared to a normalised rate of 5.5).With an assumption that would shift the electricity production of solar  wind  and hydroelectric power plants  with each of the three technologies the 2023 magnitude  the impact on the EBITDA reported in 2027 would be approximately plus or minus 48 million euros. A global deviation in 2027 of the same magnitude as that of 2023 is made much less likely due to diversification coming from the portfolio growth.CONFIRMED AND NEW ESG OBJECTIVES FOR 2027 AND 2030Voltalia confirms its ESG objective for 2027  i.e.:CO 2 equivalent avoided: over 4 million tonnes (confirmation).As a Mission-driven company  Voltalia continually strives to strengthen its commitments and positive impact on the environment and society. Today  the Company takes a new step by setting new ESG objectives to be achieved by 2027 and 2030:By 2027: 100% of solar held capacity under construction with a Stakeholder Engagement Plan (SEP) aligned with IFC standards (World Bank Group)  compared to 44% at the end of 2023.By 2027: 50% of solar held capacity in operation located on co-used or upgraded soil  compared to 37% at the end of 2023  meaning land combining solar and another human activity (such as buildings  parking lots  agriculture  and grazing) or located on lands with low biodiversity  agricultural  or economic potential (such as deserts  industrial wastelands  and abandoned quarries).By 2030: -35% of carbon intensity for solar held capacity under construction in kgCO 2 /MW (Scope 3) vs 2022 (-4% in 2023)  prioritizing the acquisition of low-carbon solar panels.UPCOMING EVENTS:First-quarter 2024 turnover  April 24  2024 (after close of trading) Annual General Meeting  May 16  2024PROSPECTIVE STATEMENTSThis press release contains forward-looking statements.

The financial statements for 2023 have been audited and approved by the Company’s Board of Directors on March 28  2024  and the financial reports are planned to be filed with the French and U.S. securities regulatory authorities  respectively  on April 5  2024. The audit procedures on the consolidated financial statements have been performed and the certification report is being prepared by the Company’s external auditors.The Company will organize a webcast on the 2023 financial results on Monday  April 8  2024  at 2:30 p.m. CEST (8:30 a.m. EST).Marc de Garidel  Chief Executive Officer of Abivax  said: “In 2023  Abivax accomplished several major milestones and made significant progress on its ongoing clinical and preclinical projects. Beyond executing one of the top worldwide financing raises in the biotech sector last year  the company implemented a strategy designed to take advantage of obefazimod’s unique and differentiated profile for the treatment of IBD. We believe we built the necessary U.S and European operational infrastructure to conduct the Phase 3 ABTECT program in UC and the planned Phase 2b Crohn’s Disease trial  potentially expanding the long-term use of obefazimod for a large patient population in a field with high unmet medical needs. In 2024  the execution of this strategy is underway by advancing our UC and CD clinical programs and  in parallel  strengthening our pipeline by evaluating a potential combination therapy with obefazimod in UC as well as advancing research on a follow-on candidate. Abivax’s scientific excellence has further been highlighted by several abstracts presented by leading U.S. and European KOLs at major scientific congresses. In addition  we continue to reinforce our Board of Directors after notable changes in 2023 and I am glad to welcome Camilla Soenderby as a new member of the Abivax Board. We are very much looking forward to working with Camilla and to benefiting from her expertise.”Didier Blondel  Chief Financial Officer of Abivax  added: “The past year was also very successful looking at the trust that our existing and new U.S. and European investors placed in us  reflected in the significant capital raises in 2023. With the successful Nasdaq IPO last year  the largest Nasdaq IPO of a French-listed biotech company  we continue to implement our multi-pronged financial strategy to fund our projects in 2024 and beyond. Abivax has secured more than EUR 500M financing in 2023 and we expect to have sufficient funds to finance our operations into Q4 2025  including through the anticipated release of top-line Phase 3 induction data from the ABTECT program.”2023 financial highlights (IFRS figures)Income Statement FY 2023 FY 2022 Change in millions of euros Total operating income 4.6 4.6 0.0 Total operating expenses of which Research and Development costs (103.2) (48.3) (54.9) of which Sales and Marketing costs (6.4) 0.0 (6.4) of which General and Administrative costs (22.4) (7.5) (14.9) of which Goodwill impairment loss (0.0) (13.6) 13.6 Operating loss (127.4) (64.8) (62.6) Financial (loss) gain (20.4) 4.1 (22.3) Net loss for the period (147.4) (60.7) (84.9)Balance Sheet FY2023 FY2022 Change in millions of euros Net financial position 203.2 (14.5) 217.7 of which other financial assets and other receivables and assets* 28.3 8.3 20.0 of which fixed-term deposits (maturing in > 1 year) 0.0 0.0 0.0 of which fixed-term deposits (maturing in < 1 year) 9.0 0.0 9.0 of which available cash and cash equivalents 251.9 26.9 225.0 (of which financial liabilities)** (77.0) (49.8) (27.2) Total Assets 327.1 75.5 251.5 Total Shareholders’ Equity 196.0 7.2 191.0 * Excluding items of the liquidity contract (liquidity and own shares) and prepaid expenses** Financial liabilities include borrowings  convertible loan notes  derivative instruments  royalty certificates and other financial liabilitiesOperating loss increased by EUR 62.6M to EUR -127.4M compared to EUR -64.8M as of December 31  2022. Operating income  consisting predominantly of Research Tax Credit  was comparable between both financial periods. The increase in operating loss was driven by operating expenses as described further below. Research and development (R&D) expenses increased by EUR 54.9M to EUR -103.2M in 2023 compared to EUR -48.3M in 2022. This increase was predominantly driven by a EUR 45.2M  or 117%  increase in expenses related to: Our UC clinical program  driven by the progression of Phase 3 clinical trials for obefazimod in UC (where Phase 3 clinical trial costs were significantly higher than in Phase 2); A EUR 2.7M increase in expenses related to our Crohn’s disease (CD) clinical program  driven by planning costs incurred for the Phase 2b CD trial; and A EUR 4.5M  or 71%  increase related to the overall expansion of the research and development headcount to support our organizational growth and the issuance of new equity awards to officers and employees in research and development. Sales and marketing (S&M) expenses were EUR -6.4M for 2023. We did not incur any sales and marketing expenses in 2022. These expenses consist primarily of consulting costs associated with market research  re-branding of our company in preparation of our U.S. initial public offering and listing on Nasdaq  as well as an early team build out in preparation for our future sales and commercialization efforts in the U.S. General and administrative (G&A) expenses increased to EUR -22.4M compared to EUR -7.5M for 2022 (excluding the one-time goodwill impairment charge taken in 2022 of EUR -13.6M to ABX196 for the treatment of hepatocellular cancer). This increase was primarily due to: An increase in personnel costs of EUR 11.7M  resulting from the issuance of new equity awards to our officers and employees; Management changes that occurred during the period and an increased G&A headcount to support the expansion of the company; and Increased legal and professional fees and other costs associated with operating as a dual-listed public company. Total number of employees at the end of December 2023 was 61 and significantly increased compared to 2022  due to the implementation of the U.S. and European operational infrastructure. For the year ended December 31  2023  our EUR -20.4M net financial loss was driven primarily by the following items: Interest expenses of EUR -4.7M relation to borrowings and loans; Non-cash expense of EUR -8.9M in relation to the fair value of our royalty certificates; Non-cash expense of EUR -3.4M related to the derecognition of certain financial liabilities; Non-cash expense of EUR -3.0M in relation to an increase in the fair value of warrant derivatives issued in relation to the Kreos/Claret financing; and Foreign exchange losses of EUR -5.6M (including the EUR -3.2M non-cash impact of the year-end revaluation of USD-denominated cash and cash equivalents); Partially offset by interest income of EUR 2.4M in relation to the invested proceeds from our U.S. initial public offering and listing on Nasdaq and decrease in the fair value of the Heights convertible notes by EUR 3.2M. Cash position (including other financial assets of EUR 9.0M) at the end of 2023 was EUR 261.0M  compared to EUR 27.0M at the end of 2022. The increase was due to a EUR 130M gross equity financing (EUR 123M net proceeds) concluded in February 2023  and two additional structured debt agreements (EUR 27M net proceeds from the first tranches) signed in August 2023. In addition  in October 2023 the Company completed its Nasdaq IPO with gross proceeds of EUR 223.3M. As part of the structured debt financing transaction for a total amount of up to EUR 75M with Kreos Capital and Claret European Growth Capital entered into on August 21  2023 (the “Kreos/Claret financing”)  Abivax proceeded with the drawdown of the second tranche of the Kreos/Claret financing for EUR 25M. This second tranche consists of 25 000 000 senior secured non-convertible bonds with a par value of EUR 1.00 each  which will not be listed on any market; The issuance of the Kreos/Claret non-convertible bonds occurred on March 28  2024; A variable interest rate of 7.5% European Central Bank Base Rate (MRO) (with a floor at 2.5% and a cap at 4%) applies to such tranche. These non-convertible bonds will be repaid monthly through March 31  2027  after a deferred repayment of the principal until February 1  2025.Based on the currently available funds  including the drawdown of the second tranche Kreos/Claret financing described above  Abivax expects to be able to finance its operating cash flow requirements into Q4 2025.Operating highlights - Ongoing clinical trialsObefazimod Phase 3 program in UC (ABTECT)The obefazimod Phase 3 ABTECT program investigating efficacy and safety in adults with moderately to severely active UC is progressing. Recruitment into both induction trials  ABTECT-1 and ABTECT-2  is ongoing in all designated regions.The ABTECT program is designed for 1 200 UC patients across 36 countries with more than 600 trial sites taking part in the pivotal Phase 3 program that covers North America  Europe  Latin America  and Asia Pacific. Clinical remission is the primary endpoint for the 8-week induction trials as well as for the 52-week maintenance trial (which is week 44 of the maintenance trial).Anticipated milestones:Q4 2024: ABTECT planned enrollment of last patient into induction trialsQ1 2025: ABTECT planned top-line induction data read-out after eight weeks of treatmentQ1 2026: ABTECT planned top-line maintenance results after one year of treatmentObjectives:Obtain robust Phase 3 data for obefazimod in moderately to severely active UC as a potentially differentiated oral treatment optionEstablish obefazimod as a potential first-line advanced therapy for the treatment of UCObefazimod 25 mg long-term extension trial in UCUC patients initially treated with 50 mg of oral  once-daily obefazimod and who completed the Phase 2a or Phase 2b maintenance trials could roll over into a follow-on  open-label long-term extension trial with a reduced dose of 25 mg.In an interim analysis as of July 31  2023  of the 71 eligible patients  63 completed their 48-week visit  with a demonstrated disease control rate (stable or improved Modified Mayo Score) of 84% (53 of 63 patients) with the 25 mg once-daily dose of obefazimod. No new safety signals were detected in UC patients treated up to five years with oral  once daily obefazimod.Anticipated milestones:Q3 2024: New obefazimod UC extension trial read-out after one and two years of continued treatment with reduced dose of 25 mgObjectives:Confirm safety and efficacy data of Phase 2 maintenance trials and long-term extension trial interim analysisConfirm safety and efficacy results for reduced dose of 25 mg obefazimod for chronic long-term useOperating highlights - Planned clinical trialsObefazimod Phase 2b trial in Crohn’s disease (ENHANCE-CD)The obefazimod Phase 2b clinical trial in moderately to severely active CD is a double-blind placebo-controlled trial  evaluating three obefazimod doses. The CD investigational new drug (IND) application was filed with the FDA and cleared to proceed in Q4 2023. The trial design consists of a 12-week induction period and a subsequent 40-week maintenance period.In alignment with FDA feedback on the Company’s initial Phase 2a IND application submission  the CD trial design was adapted to be a dose ranging Phase 2b clinical trial. These adjustments to the obefazimod CD clinical program are not expected to have an impact on the overall program budget and projected supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) submission timeline.Anticipated milestones:Q3 2024: ENHANCE-CD planned start of patient enrollment2H 2026: ENHANCE-CD planned 12-week induction data read-outObjectives:Reproduce obefazimod UC Phase 2 safety and efficacy data for the treatment of CDOperating highlights - Ongoing R&D workObefazimod in combination therapy: Based on its early clinical profile  the formal process evaluating combination therapy of oral and injectable candidates with obefazimod in UC is ongoing in preclinical models.

For AEF0117  several key achievements stand out  such as the publication in Nature Medicine presenting the molecule discovery to preliminary phase 2a efficacy results. The positive recommendation from the Data Safety Monitoring Board halfway through the phase 2b study  and the completion of patient recruitment for this study with 333 patients. Furthermore  the positive results obtained from all regulatory non-clinical studies will enable a rapid transition to phase 3 upon success of the phase 2b study. For AEF0217  the current phase 1/2 study assessing the safety and tolerability of the compound in individuals with Down syndrome will pave the way for a multicenter phase 2 study in several European countries. This study aims to assess the efficacy of AEF0217 in treating cognitive deficits associated with Down syndrome is planned to start late 2024/early 2025. We are also making progress in identifying new therapeutic indications for AEF0217. Finally  our proprietary platform has enabled us to identify several CB 1 -SSis with new properties targeting a broader range of diseases involving the CB 1 receptor. We have also appointed Arsène Guekam as Chief Corporate Development Officer  bringing his in-depth knowledge of financial markets and sector trends. For the year 2024  our main objective is to deliver on the announced clinical study timelines for our two drug-candidates. We also aim to initiate the pre-clinical development of a third CB 1 -SSi by the end of 2024. Thanks to the expertise and dedication of our team  we are confident to achieve these goals and progress towards becoming a leading player in the field of brain disease treatments.”Full-year results 2023 (IFRS)Simplified income statement1 (in €K) 2023 2022 Revenue from ordinary activities 12 358 8 364 Research and development costs (16 212) (13 792) General and administrative expenses and other operating income and expenses (2 607) (3 096) Operating income (6 461) (8 525) Financial result 1 386 (5 762) Income taxes (3) (1) Net income (loss) (5 078) (14 288)For the full year 2023  Aelis Farma recorded revenue from ordinary activities of €12.4 million  including:€9.1 million corresponding to the recognition  in accordance with IFRS 15  of the share of revenue related to the license option agreement with Indivior PLC  a leading group in the treatment of addictions  for the use of AEF0117 as a treatment of cannabis use disorders. The balance of the lump-sum payment received in 2021 and yet to be recognized over the residual term of the option amounts to €2.7 million. The revenue recognized for the fiscal year 2023  based on the progression of costs for the phase 2b of AEF0117  has increased by €5.2 million compared to 2022. This increase is attributed to the increased activity of the phase 2b clinical study and the completion of its recruitment.€3.3 million in other income from ordinary activities  comprising the Research Tax Credit (€1 597 000)  operating subsidies (€1 010 000) and studies re-invoiced without margin (€696 000) related to Aelis Farma's research programs. The decrease in other income compared to the previous fiscal year (-€1.3 million) is explained by the reduction in Research Tax Credit  linked to fewer eligible activities in 2023  given the studies carried out in the United States in particular  and the lesser impact of grants recognized in income in 2023.Research and development costsIn €K 12/31/2023 12/31/2022 Raw materials  other purchases  and external expenses (14 047) (11 574) Personnel costs (2 002) (2 052) Intellectual property (163) (166) Research and development costs (16 212) (13 792)The increase in research and development expenses (+18%) reflects significant progress in the clinical and non-clinical development programs  observed particularly in the second half of 2023  of our drug candidates AEF0117 and AEF0217  as well as the growth of activities of our proprietary discovery platform.General and administrative expensesIn €K 12/31/2023 12/31/2022 Other purchases and external charges (1 097) (1 670) Staff costs (1 510) (1 426) General and administrative expenses (2 607) (3 096)General and administrative expenses as of December 31  2023 amounted to €2 607 000  down €489 000 compared to the previous year. This decrease mainly relates to other purchases and external expenses  which included in 2022 costs relating to the Company's IPO not charged to the share premium.The operating result recorded on December 31  2023 was therefore a loss of €6 461 000  compared with a loss of €8 525 000 at December 31  2022. This change was mainly due to:the progress and completion of recruitment for the phase 2b study of AEF0117 during the fiscal year 2023;the speeding up of recruitments and expansion of the clinical centers for the phase 1/2 study with AEF0217  primarily in the second half of 2023;the continuation of development activities for the pharmaceutical production (CMC) of AEF0117 for phase 3 and of AEF0217 for phase 2  as well as other regulatory clinical and non-clinical studies required for AEF0117 to enter phase 3;the pace of revenue recognition related to the license option agreement with Indivior PLC  based on the advancement of AEF0117 phase 2b costs.Financial income showed a profit of €1 386 000 as of December 31  2023  compared with a loss of €5 762 000 at December 31  2022. This mainly comprises the financial income recognized at the moment of the payment of R&D charges  which were self-hedged in dollars. To be noted  as of December 31  2022  the non-cash financial expense associated with the conversion of convertible bonds on the date of Aelis Farma’s IPO was also recognized.The net result was a loss of €5 078 000 for the full year 2023  compared with a loss of €14 288 000 for the same period of 2022.Cash flowCash flow (in €K) 12/31/2023 12/31/2022 Cash flow from operating activities (12 959) (13 051) Net cash flow from investing activities (88) (137) Net cash flow from financing activities (967) 22 149 Impact of exchange rate changes (170) 723 Change in cash and cash equivalents (14 184) 9 684 Opening cash position 34 396 24 710 Closing cash position 20 211 34 396Financial structureFinancial structure (in €K) 12/31/2023 12/31/2022 Liquid assets a 20 230 34 396 Gross financial debt b (4 040) (3 823) Net cash position a+b 16 190 30 572The year 2022 was marked by the capital increase carried out in connection with the Company's IPO  generating a net financing cash flow of €22.1 million. In 2023  in addition to the repayment of the Company's debt maturities (-€1 million) and payments to the liquidity contract (€0.5 million)  this cash flow includes interest received on financial investments (€0.5 million).Aelis Farma’s financial structure remains robust at the end of the full year 2023  with a net cash position of €16 190 000. The Company’s cash consumption is in line with its forecasts and the progress of its research and development program.Aelis Farma believes that its current cash position will enable it to finance its development  in line with the strategy presented during the IPO  until at least the end of 2025.Highlights of the full year 2023Publication of the first article on AEF0117 in Nature MedicineIn June 2023  the prestigious scientific journal Nature Medicine published the first article describing the new pharmacological class discovered by Aelis Farma  the CB 1 -SSi  and the discovery and development of the first of these compounds  AEF0117  including the positive data from a phase 2a clinical trial in volunteers with cannabis addiction.This article provides a scientific validation of the quality of the work carried out and the potential of AEF0117  and more generally of the new CB 1 -SSi pharmacological class.Favorable review by a DSMB (Data and Safety Monitoring Board) in the phase 2b study of AEF0117The conclusions of a DSMB  the committee of independent experts to monitor the trial  were released at the end of the first semester of 2023. Safety and tolerability data from the initial 115 patients treated with AEF0117 for at least 4 weeks were assessed  and no serious adverse or significant treatment-related events were reported by the committee  which recommended continuing the study without modification to the protocol.Positive results from regulatory non-clinical studies of AEF0117AEF0117 demonstrated a highly favorable therapeutic index  over 13 000 times greater than the active dose  in in vivo toxicological studies including a chronic oral toxicity study (6 months in rats and 9 months in dogs)  allowing for chronic treatments without duration restriction in humans. Additionally  reproductive toxicology studies demonstrated that AEF0117 does not alter embryonic and embryofetal development. With the successful early completion of additional non-clinical and current clinical development complementary to toxicity studies  AEF0117 will be ready to enter phase 3 clinical trials for the treatment of cannabis addiction upon successful completion of the present phase 2b clinical trial and regulatory approval of the phase 3 protocol.Completion of recruitment for the phase 2b clinical study with AEF0117 for the treatment of cannabis addictionUnder the coordination of Professor Frances Levin from Columbia University (New York)  recruitment and randomization of the 333 patients for the phase 2b trial of AEF0117 at 11 clinical centers in the United States were completed in December 2023. The Company expects to announce the results of the study after 2024 summer break.Strengthening of the recruitment capacity for the phase 1/2 study of AEF0217 with the opening of two clinical centersThe transition of the phase 1/2 study to a multicenter trial has been completed with the aim of significantly increase the recruitment of subjects of this initial safety evaluation of AEF0217 in people with Down Syndrome. In addition  this study and the multiple encounters with Down syndrome family association is anticipating the groundwork for the establishment of a network capable of swiftly executing the future phase 2 study  evaluating the efficacy of AEF0217 for the treatment of cognitive deficits associated with Down syndrome. This study is expected to start in late 2024/early 2025.Strategy & outlookDevelop AEF0117 to address the adverse effects of excessive cannabis useAelis Farma expects to announce the efficacy results of the phase 2b study with AEF0117 after 2024 summer break. Following these results  Indivior could exercise its licensing option  triggering a license fee payment of $100 million  and up to an additional $340 million in milestone payments contingent upon the achievement of development  regulatory  and commercial milestones  as well as royalties on net sales of AEF0117 ranging from 12% to 20%.Aelis Farma aims also to finalize in 2024 additional clinical studies required for the entry into phase 3 of AEF0117. These studies  combined with positive results from the phase 2b trial and the positive results already obtained in regulatory non-clinical studies  would allow the start of phase 3 trials  upon approval by regulatory agencies of their clinical protocols.Develop AEF0217 to address various cognitive deficits  including those associated with Down syndromeThe primary objective for 2024 is to successfully complete the phase 1/2 study and the initiation of the phase 2 study. The phase 1/2 study aims primarily to analyze the safety and pharmacokinetics of AEF0217 in Down syndrome people. The obtention of convincing safety and pharmacokinetic results would pave the way for a multicenter phase 2 study  expected to start late 2024/early 2025  that will aim to demonstrate the therapeutic effects of AEF0217 for the treatment of cognitive deficits associated with Down syndrome. The development of AEF0217 in Down syndrome benefits from a grant of €6 million of the European community (Project ICOD No. 899986).In 2024  the Company also aims to strength the knowledge on the additional therapeutic indications of AEF0217 which include the cognitive deficits observed in genetic forms of autism spectrum disorders  during aging and in neuropsychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia and Parkinson’s disease.Identifying new drug candidatesGiven the involvement of the CB 1 receptor in numerous pathologies and leveraging its diversified and exclusive library of CB 1 -SSi  Aelis Farma continues to characterize new CB 1 -SSi candidates which aim to treat other CB 1 receptor-dependent disorders.***About AELIS FARMAFounded in Bordeaux in 2013  Aelis Farma is a biopharmaceutical company that is developing a new class of drugs  the Signaling-Specific inhibitors of the CB 1 receptor of the endocannabinoid system (CB 1 -SSi). CB 1 -SSi have been developed by Aelis Farma based on the discovery of a natural regulatory mechanism of CB 1 hyperactivity made by the team led by Dr. Pier Vincenzo Piazza  the Company’s CEO  when he was the director of the Neurocentre Magendie of the INSERM in Bordeaux. By mimicking this natural mechanism  CB 1 -SSi appear to selectively inhibit the disease-related activity of the CB 1 receptor without disrupting its normal physiological activity. CB 1 -SSi have consequently the potential to provide new safe treatments for several brain diseases.Aelis Farma is currently developing two first-in-class clinical-stage drug candidates: AEF0117 for the treatment of cannabis use disorder (CUD)  currently being tested in a phase 2b study in the United States; and AEF0217 for cognitive disorders  including those of Down Syndrome (Trisomy 21)  currently in a phase 1/2 study in Spain in people with Down syndrome. The Company also has a portfolio of new innovative CB 1 -SSi for the treatment of other disorders associated with a dysregulation of the activity of the CB 1 receptor.Aelis Farma draws on the talents of more than 25 highly qualified employees.For more information  visit www.aelisfarma.com and follow us on LinkedIn and Twitter.ISIN: FR0014007ZB4Ticker: AELISB Compartment of Euronext ParisDisclaimerForward-looking statementsSome information contained in this press release are forward-looking statements  not historical data.

This industrial and commercial maturity sets us apart from other high-impact projects. Achieving our operational  financial and environmental ambitions is our priority  beginning with the start-up of continuous production at AFYREN NEOXY.""rEcent milestonesUpdate on AFYREN NEOXY's progressFollowing the on-time delivery of the AFYREN NEOXY plant in 2022 and its successful industrial commissioning  operational teams focused in 2023 on the start-up of production  with the manufacture of several tons of products and the delivery of the first batches in mid-2023.Work carried out in the second half of 2023 revealed the following findings:Fermentation cycles (a biological process) carried out since 2022 have confirmed the core of the process  with yields coming in as expected.Some post-fermentation stages (related to separation and purification by chemical processes) are not yet stable enough to allow the plant to run continuously.To date  work has focused on the separation stage. This requires long  continuous cycles to carry out the adjustments and modifications that will enable operation under the pre-defined design.In light of these factors  in December 2023 the Company revised its operating timetable to aim for the start of continuous production in 2024  with break-even1 in 2025.Shareholders AFYREN and Bpifrance have confirmed their commitment in 2023 by subscribing to a cash capital increase and convertible bonds. Any additional plant requirements in 2024 will be covered.In recognition of the work carried out by AFYREN NEOXY and its AFTER-BIOCHEM consortium partners and the industrial milestones achieved  AFYREN NEOXY received at the end of 2023 a further payment of €3.4 million from CBE JU2  a European Union entity.In this same context  AFYREN and SUEZ announced in March 2024 that they would continue their collaboration on the use of waste from SUEZ's collection and treatment activities (in particular bio-waste) in the AFYREN process.In the autumn of 2023  AFYREN NEOXY's governance evolved: Jérémy Pessiot  Deputy CEO  R&D Director and co-Founder of AFYREN  took over as Chairman to further strengthen the links between the parent company and its plant.Ongoing industrial development in France and abroadIn 2023  the teams continued to work on AFYREN's industrial development worldwide. In Asia  AFYREN is in the process of setting up a joint venture in Thailand with Mitr Phol  the world's 3rd largest sugar group. The aim of the project is to set up a biobased carboxylic acid plant near Bangkok.In 2023  discussions focused on the constitution and governance of the joint venture  the licensing of biotechnological know-how and local industrial facilities. They are continuing with a view to reaching a final agreement on the terms of the partnership.In addition  studies continue to be carried out to increase AFYREN's production capacity  in France and abroad. The AFYREN NEOXY extension scenario is under assessment  offering the possibility to capitalize on existing assets with a better control on the financial budget.In 2024  AFYREN's operational teams will continue this work  while giving priority to the start-up of continuous production at the first plant.Concrete progress on the ESG3 roadmapIntegral to AFYREN's value proposition and supported by ambitious corporate governance  ESG is at the heart of AFYREN's strategy.Recent achievements include:Participation in the “ Convention des Entreprises pour le Climat ” (CEC) and publication of a regenerative roadmap in early 2024. ( link )” (CEC) and publication of a regenerative roadmap in early 2024. ( ) The success of the Group's first HR survey (AFYREN Global People Survey)  reflecting team commitment with a 97% participation rate.In 2023  EcoVadis  one of the world's most recognized independent CSR assessment platforms  award AFYREN a silver medal for its first rating exercise.A further increase in EthiFinance's extra-financial rating in 2024 to 83/100 (Platinum Level)  underscored a higher level of ESG maturity compared with similar companies4.Since the end of 2023  the Company has been analyzing its ESG performance indicators in the light of future CSRD requirements (""Gap Analysis""). A selection of extra-financial indicators will be detailed in AFYREN's first CSR report  scheduled for publication in the second quarter of 2024.A solid financial baseA stable loss thanks to disciplined cost managementSimplified P&L (in thousands of euros) 12/2023 12/2022 Var.

Revenue is essentially made up of income from intellectual property and know-how held by the Group  unchanged compared with 2022  and income from various contracts entered into with AFYREN NEOXY  slightly down compared with 2022. These contracts cover various technical services provided during the start-up of the plant.Net operating expenses5 amounted to €9.3 million in 2023  compared with €8.8 million in 2022  an increase of €0.5 million mainly attributable to:staff costs up €0.9 million due to the increase in the number of employees  with the average number of full-time equivalents (FTE) increasing by 8 peoplepurchases and external expenses  up €0.7 million  including expenses related to the development of the Group’s next plants  particularly in ThailandThese increases are partially offset by lower non-cash expenses related to the recognition of long-term incentive plans for managers and employees compared with 2022 (down €1.1 million).Within operating expenses  research and development spending recognized as expenses amount to €1.8 million in 2023  stable compared with 2022.Current operating result was a loss of €5.9 million.Financial result records a €1.3 million improvement thanks to financial income from cash and cash equivalent investment  as financial costs are slightly down.The share accounted for in AFYREN NEOXY's net income was a loss of €4.8 million at end 2023  compared with a loss of €3.7 million at end 2022. This change is mainly related to the plant's operating expenses  in the absence of revenue. AFYREN NEOXY will recognize revenue when acid batches are delivered to its customers from continuous production.Net result was a loss of €9.6 million at the end of 2023  compared with a loss of €9.2 million at the end of 2022 reflecting a well-controlled cost base in the pre-continuous production / pre-revenue phase.€50 million in cash available as of December 31  2023 thanks to limited cash consumptionSimplified balance sheet (in thousands of euros) 12/2023 12/2022 Non-current financial assets 19 479 20 998 of which equity-accounted securities 14 185 16 513 Current assets 50 948 63 822 of which cash and cash equivalents 49 559 62 333 Total assets 70 427 84 821 Equity 61 799 70 978 Non-current provisions 4 213 5 885 of which loans and financial debts 3 176 3 485 Current liabilities 4 414 7 958 of which loans and financial debts 1 611 5 054 Total liabilities 70 427 84 821As of end December 2023  AFYREN has a solid balance sheet with Shareholder’s equity of €61.8 million  the decrease compared to end of December 2022 coming from the net loss of the period.Total financial debt is limited  at €4.8 million6 compared with €8.5 million at end 2022. The decrease comes mostly from the repayment in March 2023 of convertible bonds subscribed in March 2020.The Group has a cash position of €49.6 million. Cash outflows over the period totaled €12.8 million  of which €7.1 million related to the strengthening of the AFYREN NEOXY financial position and the repayment of the convertible bonds  against €1 million of new loan subscription (“Prêt Innovation”). Adjusted for these items  the underlying cash burn was €6.7 million.Outlook and financial goalsThe anticipated delays in the start-up of AFYREN NEOXY have an impact on the timetable for future plants  which must capitalize on the return on experience from the first.The Company is maintaining its medium-term operating (3 units) and financial goals of the initial plans presented in 2021 (€150 million in annual sales and 30% EBITDA margin)  but envisages a sequence starting with a 18- to 24-month delay.AFYREN aims to achieve the following:three production units with a combined installed capacity of around 70 000 tons of acids (vs 72 000 tons) by 2028; of which at least two in continuous production (including the existing plant AFYREN NEOXY) 7 . These three units will also produce a high added-value fertilizer  ensuring the circularity of the model;. These three units will also produce a high added-value fertilizer  ensuring the circularity of the model; accumulated production revenue from the three units of more than €150 million  at full capacity;a target current EBITDA margin at Group level of around 30%8  at full capacity.2023 FINANCIAL REPORT AVAILABLEThe Company will make its 2023 annual financial report in French available to the public and file it with the Autorité des marchés financiers no later than April 12  2024.

The financial statements for 2023 have been audited and approved by the Company’s Board of Directors on March 28  2024  and the financial reports are planned to be filed with the French and U.S. securities regulatory authorities  respectively  on April 5  2024. The audit procedures on the consolidated financial statements have been performed and the certification report is being prepared by the Company’s external auditors. The Company will organize a webcast on the 2023 financial results on Monday  April 8  2024  at 2:30 p.m. CEST (8:30 a.m. EST). Marc de Garidel  Chief Executive Officer of Abivax  said: “In 2023  Abivax accomplished several major milestones and made significant progress on its ongoing clinical and preclinical projects. Beyond executing one of the top worldwide financing raises in the biotech sector last year  the company implemented a strategy designed to take advantage of obefazimod’s unique and differentiated profile for the treatment of IBD. We believe we built the necessary U.S and European operational infrastructure to conduct the Phase 3 ABTECT program in UC and the planned Phase 2b Crohn’s Disease trial  potentially expanding the long-term use of obefazimod for a large patient population in a field with high unmet medical needs. In 2024  the execution of this strategy is underway by advancing our UC and CD clinical programs and  in parallel  strengthening our pipeline by evaluating a potential combination therapy with obefazimod in UC as well as advancing research on a follow-on candidate. Abivax’s scientific excellence has further been highlighted by several abstracts presented by leading U.S. and European KOLs at major scientific congresses. In addition  we continue to reinforce our Board of Directors after notable changes in 2023 and I am glad to welcome Camilla Soenderby as a new member of the Abivax Board. We are very much looking forward to working with Camilla and to benefiting from her expertise.” Didier Blondel  Chief Financial Officer of Abivax  added: “The past year was also very successful looking at the trust that our existing and new U.S. and European investors placed in us  reflected in the significant capital raises in 2023. With the successful Nasdaq IPO last year  the largest Nasdaq IPO of a French-listed biotech company  we continue to implement our multi-pronged financial strategy to fund our projects in 2024 and beyond. Abivax has secured more than EUR 500M financing in 2023 and we expect to have sufficient funds to finance our operations into Q4 2025  including through the anticipated release of top-line Phase 3 induction data from the ABTECT program.”2023 financial highlights (IFRS figures) Income Statement FY 2023 FY 2022 Change in millions of euros Total operating income 4.6 4.6 0.0 Total operating expenses of which Research and Development costs (103.2) (48.3) (54.9) of which Sales and Marketing costs (6.4) 0.0 (6.4) of which General and Administrative costs (22.4) (7.5) (14.9) of which Goodwill impairment loss (0.0) (13.6) 13.6 Operating loss (127.4) (64.8) (62.6) Financial (loss) gain (20.4) 4.1 (22.3) Net loss for the period (147.4) (60.7) (84.9) Balance Sheet FY2023 FY2022 Change in millions of euros Net financial position 203.2 (14.5) 217.7 of which other financial assets and other receivables and assets* 28.3 8.3 20.0 of which fixed-term deposits (maturing in > 1 year) 0.0 0.0 0.0 of which fixed-term deposits (maturing in < 1 year) 9.0 0.0 9.0 of which available cash and cash equivalents 251.9 26.9 225.0 (of which financial liabilities)** (77.0) (49.8) (27.2) Total Assets 327.1 75.5 251.5 Total Shareholders’ Equity 196.0 7.2 191.0 * Excluding items of the liquidity contract (liquidity and own shares) and prepaid expenses** Financial liabilities include borrowings  convertible loan notes  derivative instruments  royalty certificates and other financial liabilities Operating loss increased by EUR 62.6M to EUR -127.4M compared to EUR -64.8M as of December 31  2022. Operating income  consisting predominantly of Research Tax Credit  was comparable between both financial periods. The increase in operating loss was driven by operating expenses as described further below.Research and development (R&D) expenses increased by EUR 54.9M to EUR -103.2M in 2023 compared to EUR -48.3M in 2022. This increase was predominantly driven by a EUR 45.2M  or 117%  increase in expenses related to: Our UC clinical program  driven by the progression of Phase 3 clinical trials for obefazimod in UC (where Phase 3 clinical trial costs were significantly higher than in Phase 2); A EUR 2.7M increase in expenses related to our Crohn’s disease (CD) clinical program  driven by planning costs incurred for the Phase 2b CD trial; and A EUR 4.5M  or 71%  increase related to the overall expansion of the research and development headcount to support our organizational growth and the issuance of new equity awards to officers and employees in research and development.Sales and marketing (S&M) expenses were EUR -6.4M for 2023. We did not incur any sales and marketing expenses in 2022. These expenses consist primarily of consulting costs associated with market research  re-branding of our company in preparation of our U.S. initial public offering and listing on Nasdaq  as well as an early team build out in preparation for our future sales and commercialization efforts in the U.S.General and administrative (G&A) expenses increased to EUR -22.4M compared to EUR -7.5M for 2022 (excluding the one-time goodwill impairment charge taken in 2022 of EUR -13.6M to ABX196 for the treatment of hepatocellular cancer). This increase was primarily due to: An increase in personnel costs of EUR 11.7M  resulting from the issuance of new equity awards to our officers and employees; Management changes that occurred during the period and an increased G&A headcount to support the expansion of the company; and Increased legal and professional fees and other costs associated with operating as a dual-listed public company.Total number of employees at the end of December 2023 was 61 and significantly increased compared to 2022  due to the implementation of the U.S. and European operational infrastructure.For the year ended December 31  2023  our EUR -20.4M net financial loss was driven primarily by the following items: Interest expenses of EUR -4.7M relation to borrowings and loans; Non-cash expense of EUR -8.9M in relation to the fair value of our royalty certificates; Non-cash expense of EUR -3.4M related to the derecognition of certain financial liabilities; Non-cash expense of EUR -3.0M in relation to an increase in the fair value of warrant derivatives issued in relation to the Kreos/Claret financing; and Foreign exchange losses of EUR -5.6M (including the EUR -3.2M non-cash impact of the year-end revaluation of USD-denominated cash and cash equivalents); Partially offset by interest income of EUR 2.4M in relation to the invested proceeds from our U.S. initial public offering and listing on Nasdaq and decrease in the fair value of the Heights convertible notes by EUR 3.2M.Cash position (including other financial assets of EUR 9.0M) at the end of 2023 was EUR 261.0M  compared to EUR 27.0M at the end of 2022. The increase was due to a EUR 130M gross equity financing (EUR 123M net proceeds) concluded in February 2023  and two additional structured debt agreements (EUR 27M net proceeds from the first tranches) signed in August 2023. In addition  in October 2023 the Company completed its Nasdaq IPO with gross proceeds of EUR 223.3M. As part of the structured debt financing transaction for a total amount of up to EUR 75M with Kreos Capital and Claret European Growth Capital entered into on August 21  2023 (the “Kreos/Claret financing”)  Abivax proceeded with the drawdown of the second tranche of the Kreos/Claret financing for EUR 25M. This second tranche consists of 25 000 000 senior secured non-convertible bonds with a par value of EUR 1.00 each  which will not be listed on any market; The issuance of the Kreos/Claret non-convertible bonds occurred on March 28  2024; A variable interest rate of 7.5% European Central Bank Base Rate (MRO) (with a floor at 2.5% and a cap at 4%) applies to such tranche. These non-convertible bonds will be repaid monthly through March 31  2027  after a deferred repayment of the principal until February 1  2025.with Kreos Capital and Claret European Growth Capital entered into on August 21  2023 (the “Kreos/Claret financing”)  Abivax proceeded with the drawdown of the second tranche of the Kreos/Claret financing for EUR 25M. Based on the currently available funds  including the drawdown of the second tranche Kreos/Claret financing described above  Abivax expects to be able to finance its operating cash flow requirements into Q4 2025.Operating highlights - Ongoing clinical trials Obefazimod Phase 3 program in UC (ABTECT) The obefazimod Phase 3 ABTECT program investigating efficacy and safety in adults with moderately to severely active UC is progressing. Recruitment into both induction trials  ABTECT-1 and ABTECT-2  is ongoing in all designated regions. The ABTECT program is designed for 1 200 UC patients across 36 countries with more than 600 trial sites taking part in the pivotal Phase 3 program that covers North America  Europe  Latin America  and Asia Pacific. Clinical remission is the primary endpoint for the 8-week induction trials as well as for the 52-week maintenance trial (which is week 44 of the maintenance trial). Anticipated milestones: Q4 2024: ABTECT planned enrollment of last patient into induction trialsQ1 2025: ABTECT planned top-line induction data read-out after eight weeks of treatmentQ1 2026: ABTECT planned top-line maintenance results after one year of treatment Objectives: Obtain robust Phase 3 data for obefazimod in moderately to severely active UC as a potentially differentiated oral treatment optionEstablish obefazimod as a potential first-line advanced therapy for the treatment of UCObefazimod 25 mg long-term extension trial in UC UC patients initially treated with 50 mg of oral  once-daily obefazimod and who completed the Phase 2a or Phase 2b maintenance trials could roll over into a follow-on  open-label long-term extension trial with a reduced dose of 25 mg. In an interim analysis as of July 31  2023  of the 71 eligible patients  63 completed their 48-week visit  with a demonstrated disease control rate (stable or improved Modified Mayo Score) of 84% (53 of 63 patients) with the 25 mg once-daily dose of obefazimod. No new safety signals were detected in UC patients treated up to five years with oral  once daily obefazimod. Anticipated milestones: Q3 2024: New obefazimod UC extension trial read-out after one and two years of continued treatment with reduced dose of 25 mg Objectives: Confirm safety and efficacy data of Phase 2 maintenance trials and long-term extension trial interim analysisConfirm safety and efficacy results for reduced dose of 25 mg obefazimod for chronic long-term useOperating highlights - Planned clinical trials Obefazimod Phase 2b trial in Crohn’s disease (ENHANCE-CD) The obefazimod Phase 2b clinical trial in moderately to severely active CD is a double-blind placebo-controlled trial  evaluating three obefazimod doses. The CD investigational new drug (IND) application was filed with the FDA and cleared to proceed in Q4 2023. The trial design consists of a 12-week induction period and a subsequent 40-week maintenance period. In alignment with FDA feedback on the Company’s initial Phase 2a IND application submission  the CD trial design was adapted to be a dose ranging Phase 2b clinical trial. These adjustments to the obefazimod CD clinical program are not expected to have an impact on the overall program budget and projected supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) submission timeline. Anticipated milestones: Q3 2024: ENHANCE-CD planned start of patient enrollment2H 2026: ENHANCE-CD planned 12-week induction data read-out Objectives: Reproduce obefazimod UC Phase 2 safety and efficacy data for the treatment of CDOperating highlights - Ongoing R&D work Obefazimod in combination therapy: Based on its early clinical profile  the formal process evaluating combination therapy of oral and injectable candidates with obefazimod in UC is ongoing in preclinical models.

This causes major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care  they become ineffective  untolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing ""diuretic-resistant"" patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  delivering major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients and reducing costs for healthcare systems.The Company's Premarket Approval (PMA) application for the alfapump was submitted to the US FDA in December 2023 and accepted for substantive review in January 2024  having reported positive primary and secondary endpoint data from the North American pivotal POSEIDON study in recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis.Results of the Company's RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure support DSR's mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE  a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study  have been successfully treated with DSR  resulting in a dramatic improvement in diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements. The independent Data Safety Monitoring Board approved the start of the randomized MOJAVE cohort of up to a further 30 patients  which is planned after alfapump US PMA approval.Sequana Medical is listed on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent  Belgium. For further information  please visit www.sequanamedical.com.Important Regulatory DisclaimersThe alfapump® system is currently not approved in the United States or Canada. In the United States and Canada  the alfapump system is currently under clinical investigation (POSEIDON Trial) and is being studied in adult patients with refractory or recurrent ascites due to liver cirrhosis. DSR® therapy is still in development and it should be noted that any statements regarding safety and efficacy arise from ongoing pre-clinical and clinical investigations which have yet to be completed. There is no link between DSR therapy and ongoing investigations with the alfapump system in Europe  the United States or Canada.Note: alfapump® and DSR® are registered trademarks.Forward-looking statementsThis press release may contain predictions  estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking statements.Such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance.

Chicago wheat was down 1.5% in US trading.Wheat markets had climbed on Thursday on the back of a smaller-than-anticipated official projection of this year’s US corn area.But favourable US weather forecasts and the highest rating for the US winter wheat crop in five years put the focus back on ample grain supply. That encouraged traders to look beyond soggy conditions in western Europe and dryness in the Black Sea zone.
