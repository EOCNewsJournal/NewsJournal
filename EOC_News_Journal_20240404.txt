Item 12: The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolve to establish a long-term incentive programme for certain employees (""LTI 2024"") in accordance with the following. BackgroundThe LTI 2024 is a variable long-term incentive program that provides senior management and key personnel (currently approximately 60 people) the opportunity to receive a cash bonus that  after deduction for taxes  shall be used to acquire class B shares in Wästbygg Group. The overall purpose of the LTI 2024 is to align the interests of the Company's employees and shareholders and thus ensure a maximal long-term creation of value. LTI 2024 is also intended to create a long-term focus on the profit trend  growth and sustainability among the participants. The LTI 2024 is further considered to increase the Company's ability to recruit and retain current and future senior executives and other key personnel. The LTI 2024 is one part of an overall competitive compensation package to senior executives. The Board of Directors is therefore of the opinion that the proposed LTI 2024 is to the benefit of the Company and its shareholders. It is the Board of Directors intention to evaluate current LTI programs in the following year and the ambition is further to propose programs similar to the LTI 2024 to future annual general meetings. The Board of Directors further intends to put forth a proposal regarding the repurchase and transfer of the Company's own shares required to complete the implementation of the LTI 2024 to the participants to the 2025 annual general meeting. Terms and conditions for the LTI 20241. The LTI 2024 shall include employees in three categories. The first category includes the group CEO  the second category includes other members of the group senior management and the third category includes other company management and function leads. Employees that have been recruited but have not yet started their employment in Wästbygg Group when notice of participation in the program is due  can be offered to participate under the condition that the employment is indeed started. 2. LTI 2024 involves giving the participants the opportunity to receive a cash bonus based on Wästbygg Group's EBITDA level for 2024  (""the EBITDA Target""). The EBITDA Target constitutes 85 percent of the maximum bonus amount in accordance with Item 8. The remaining 15 percent of the maximum bonus amount represents a sustainability target involving a reduced carbon footprint in absolute figures for the group  (""the Sustainability Target""). 3. The fulfilment of the EBITDA Target and the Sustainability Target shall be assessed by the Board of Directors in connection with the publication of the Year-end Report for 2024  after which the approved bonus amount will be paid out. The right to obtain a bonus is dependent on the participant still being an employee of the Company at the time of the issuing of the year-end report and that the participant has not terminated his/her employment or had his/her employment terminated for personal reasons. 4. Prior to determining and paying the bonus amount  the Board of Directors shall determine whether payment according to the principles set forth above is appropriate considering the Company's profits or loss  financial position as well as market conditions and other relevant conditions. If the Board of Directors determines that such payment is not appropriate  the Board may decide to reduce the bonus amount to be paid. 5. The participants shall  in order to participate in the program  use the full bonus amount received under the LTI 2024  after deduction for taxes  to acquire class B shares in the Company (""Saving Shares""). The Company has assigned an administrator to acquire the Saving Shares on behalf of the participants to simplify the control and administration of LTI 2024. 6. The investment in Saving Shares shall be made through the acquisition of class B shares no later than 30 June  2025  (the ""Investment Period""). The Board of Directors shall be entitled to prolong the Investment Period if the participants have been unable to acquire said shares due to applicable insider regulations. 7. If the Saving Shares are retained from the expiration of the Investment Period until 30 June  2028  (the ""Saving Period"") and the participant has continued his/her employment with the Company or another company in the Wästbygg group during the entire Saving Period the participant has the right to obtain additional class B shares in the Company free of charge (""Matching Shares""). The transfer of Matching Shares to the participant is conditional upon the following annual general meeting's resolution regarding the repurchase and transfer of the Company's own shares. 8. The maximum bonus amount that each participant may obtain under the LTI 2024 is limited to the percentages of the participant's fixed annual salary as set forth below.Position Maximum number of Matching Shares per Saving Share Maximum bonus amount % of fixed annual salary Group CEO 1 15% Other members of the group senior management and certain key employees 1 10% Other company senior management 1 6% 9. Prior to determining the number of Matching Shares to be allotted the Board of Directors shall determine whether allotment in accordance with the principles set forth above is appropriate considering the Company's profits or loss  financial position as well as market conditions and other relevant conditions. If the Board of Directors determines that such distribution is not appropriate  the Board may decide to reduce the number of Matching Shares to be allotted. 10. The number of Matching Shares to be obtained based on Saving Shares may be subject to recalculation due to bonus issues  share splits and reverse share splits  rights issues and similar events. 11. Allotment of Matching Shares shall take place within 30 days from the end of the Saving Period. 12. Participation in the LTI 2024 is conditional upon such participation being legally possible and that such participation can be made possible without unreasonable administrative costs for the Company  according to the Company's opinion. 13. In accordance with point 14 below  the Board of Directors shall in some cases have the right to decide on the proportional allotment of Matching Shares if the participant's employment has been terminated before the expiration of the Saving Period. 14. The LTI 2024 shall be governed by separate agreements with each participant. The Board of Directors shall be responsible for the detailed design and management of the LTI 2024 within the principal terms and conditions set forth above. The Board of Directors shall moreover be entitled to make minor adjustments in the terms and conditions if required by legal or administrative circumstances. The Board of Directors may also make minor adjustments and deviations from the terms and conditions due to other local rules and market practices. In the event of a public takeover bid  a sale of the Company's business  liquidation  merger or any other such transaction affecting the Company  the Board of Directors shall be entitled to resolve that the Matching Shares (partially or in full) shall be obtained and allotted on completion of such transaction. The Board shall make this resolution with regard to the remainder of the Saving Period as well as other factors deemed relevant. 15. Wästbygg Group pays the social security contributions for bonuses that are paid through the LTI 2024. The compensation under the LTI further includes vacation pay and shall not be pensionable. However  if the compensation is pensionable according to an applicable collective agreement the compensation paid under the LTI 2024 shall also include pension provisions. Administration of LTI 2024 The Board of Directors shall be responsible for the detailed design and management of the LTI 2024 within the principal terms and conditions set forth above. The Board of Directors shall moreover be entitled to make minor adjustments in the terms and conditions if required by legal or administrative circumstances. The Board of Directors may also make minor adjustments and deviations from the terms and conditions due to other local rules and market practices. Costs  affections on key figures and already established incentive programs The Board of Directors has made a preliminary cost calculation for the LTI 2024. The costs of the LTI 2024  which are reported in connection to the profit and loss statement  are calculated in accordance with the accounting standard IFRS 2 and accrued over the vesting period  which ends in June 2028. The costs of the LTI 2024 are based on the LTI 2024 comprising a maximum of 60 participants. In total  the costs of the LTI 2024  when calculated in accordance with the IFRS 2  are estimated to amount to approximately SEK 4 300 000  excluding social security contributions. The costs for social security contributions and pension are estimated to amount to a total of approximately SEK 1 300 000  based on the presumptions set forth above and an average tax rate for social security contributions of 31.42 percent. The expected cost of SEK 5 600 000  including social security contributions  is equivalent to around 1 percent of the Company's total personnel costs for financial year 2023. The calculations are made on the basis of the persons who are currently intended to be covered by LTI 2024 and on their present salary levels. The costs may change if the number of people covered by LTI 2024 changes. The Annual General Meeting 2023 resolved on the implementation of LTI 2023. The outcome of LTI 2023 and of the Company's STI programme are described in detail in the Company's Annual Report. To all intents and purposes  the terms and conditions for LTI 2024 mainly correspond to the terms and conditions for LTI 2023  which was approved by the Annual General Meeting 2023  however that the growth target has been shifted over to an EBITDA target in order to further empower work with recreation of the Company's profit. Item 13 (a): The Board of Directors proposes that the General Meeting resolves to authorise the Board to decide on the acquisition of the Company's own class B shares. The purpose of the authorisation on the acquisition of the Company's own shares is to give the Board increased flexibility and the opportunity to adapt the Company's capital structure on an ongoing basis and thereby increase shareholder value and enable the Board to take advantage of attractive acquisition opportunities by financing the acquisition of companies  businesses or assets  in whole or in part  and also to provide the Company's current LTI programme at any time with the Company's own shares. In the light of the above  the Board proposes that the Extraordinary General Meeting authorises the Board to decide on the acquisition of the Company's own shares on the following terms and conditions: Acquisitions may be made on Nasdaq Stockholm (""the Stock Exchange""). Acquisitions may be made on one or more occasions before the Annual General Meeting 2025. Acquisitions may be made up to a maximum of the number of shares that ensures that the Company's total holdings after the acquisition amount to a maximum of one-tenth of all shares in the Company. Acquisitions on the Stock Exchange may only be made at a price per share of which is within the registered price range at any time  or  in the event that the Board gives a Stock Exchange member the assignment of accumulating a certain number of the Company's shares in his/her own book over a certain time period  at a price per share within the current price range at any time  or the equivalent volume-weighted average price. Payment for acquired shares in the Company shall be made in cash. In the event of acquisitions  all applicable provisions in the Stock Exchange's rules are to be complied with. In relation to the proposal  the Board of Directors has issued an opinion on the soundness of the proposal in accordance with Chap. 19 § 22 of the Swedish Companies Act (2005:551). Item 13 (b): The Board of Directors proposes that the General Meeting resolves to authorise the Board to decide on the disposal of the Company's own B shares. The purpose of the authorisation on the disposal of the Company's own shares  as well as the departure from the shareholders' preferential right  is to give the Board  in a corresponding way  the opportunity to adapt the Company's capital structure on an ongoing basis and thereby increase shareholder value and enable the Board to take advantage of attractive acquisition opportunities by financing the acquisition of companies  businesses or assets  in whole or in part. It is to be noted that all transfers of bought-back shares to the participants in the Company's current LTI programme at any time is subject to the approval of the General Meeting. The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorises the Board to decide on the disposal of the Company's own B shares on the following terms and conditions: Disposals may be made on the Stock Exchange and/or in another manner with or without departure from the shareholders' preferential right  and with or without non-cash consideration  set-off of receivables from the Company or otherwise with conditions. Disposals may be made on one or more occasions before the Annual General Meeting 2025. Disposals of B shares on the Stock Exchange may take place only at a price per share which is within the registered price range at any time. Disposals which take place in another manner may take place at a price in money or value of the property received which is equivalent to the Stock Exchange price at the time of the disposal of the B shares which are being disposed of with a departure which the Board finds appropriate. The Board of Directors has the right to determine other conditions for the disposals. It is proposed that both the shares which are held by the Company on the date of the Notice of the Annual General Meeting 2024 and the shares which are acquired under the authorisation which is requested in accordance with (a) above  be available for disposal under this authorisation. On the date of the Notice of the Annual General Meeting 2024  Wästbygg Group holds 424 687 of its own B shares  equivalent to around 1.3 percent of the total number of outstanding shares in the Company. Item 14: The Board proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorises the Board  for the period until the next Annual General Meeting  to decide on a new issue of B shares  warrants and/or convertibles. The issue may take place with or without departure from the shareholders' preferential right  and with or without non-cash consideration  set-off of receivables from the Company or otherwise with conditions. The rationale for the proposal and the reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential right and/or the opportunity to resolve on a new issue with provisions on non-cash consideration  set-off or otherwise with conditions  is to give the board flexibility in financing and enabling an accelerated expansion and development of the Group  its market and product  for example through the acquisition of companies  businesses or assets for which payment will be made wholly or partly in newly-issued shares and/or to enable the Board of Directors to acquire capital rapidly for such acquisitions. The number of B shares issued under the authorisation  through the exercise of options and the conversion of convertibles which are issued under the authorisation  may be a maximum of 3 234 016 shares  which  on full subscription  corresponds to a dilution of around ten percent of all shares in the Company on the date of the Notice of the Annual General Meeting 2024. The maximum number of B shares issued under the authorisation  through the exercise of options and the conversion of convertibles which are issued under the authorisation  shall be recalculated in the event of a bonus issue (with issue of new shares)  a split or consolidation occurs in the Company. The issue shall take place on market terms. The Board of Directors has the right to determine other conditions for the share issues. Authorisation in respect of adjustments The Board of Directors or a person appointed by the Board of Directors is authorised to make the minor formal adjustments to the decision which may prove necessary in connection with registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office. THE NUMBER OF SHARES AND VOTES As at the date of issuance of this Notice  the total number of shares in the Company amounted to 32 340 165  of which the number of A shares was 620 000 and the number of B shares was 31 720 165. The Company held 424 687 of its own B shares on the date of the Notice.

Therese Utengen is proposed by Grant Thornton Sweden AB as auditor in charge if they are elected. The proposal is in accordance with the board of directors' recommendation.The board of directors' proposal regarding guidelines for compensation to senior executives (item 17)According to chapter 8 section 51 of the Swedish Companies Act (Sw. aktiebolagslagen)  the board of directors is obliged to draw up a proposal for new guidelines for remuneration to senior executives when there is a need for substantial changes to the guidelines  but at any event at least every four years. The current guidelines were adopted at the 2020 annual general meeting and new guidelines must therefore be adopted at the 2024 annual general meeting.The board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting decide on the following guidelines for remuneration to senior executives in Medivir. The proposed guidelines are in all material aspects corresponding to the guidelines adopted at the 2020 annual general meeting. However  it has been clarified that pension benefits can exceed 25 percent of the fixed salary if this follows from the applicable collective agreement. Furthermore  the notice period for the CEO has been adjusted.Senior executives includes the managing director and other persons in the group management. The guidelines should be applied to compensation that is agreed upon  and changes that are made to already agreed compensation  after the guidelines have been adopted by the annual general meeting in 2024. The guidelines do not cover compensation that is decided by the general meeting.The guidelines' promotion of Medivir's business strategy  long-term interests and sustainabilityMedivir creates shareholder value by developing innovative cancer medicines for major medical needs  either in-house or in partnership with other companies. For further information on Medivir's business strategy  please visit the Company´s website www.medivir.com. The successful implementation of the business strategy and the safeguarding of Medivir's long-term interests  including its sustainability  requires that Medivir can recruit and retain competent employees who work to achieve maximum shareholder and customer value. This requires that Medivir can offer competitive remuneration. These guidelines enable senior executives to be offered a competitive total compensation.In Medivir  long-term incentive programs have been established by two warrant programs and a share matching program. They have been decided by the general meeting and are therefore not covered by these guidelines. For the same reason  the incentive program that the board has proposed that the annual general meeting in 2024 should adopt is also not covered. More information about the previous incentive programs is available on Medivir´s website.The forms of compensation etc.The compensation for senior executives must be market-based and may consist of the following components: fixed cash salary  variable cash compensation  pension benefits and other benefits. The general meeting can in addition - and independently of these guidelines - decide on  for example  share and share price-related compensation. The total compensation for senior executives should contain a balanced mix of the above-mentioned components and conditions in the event of termination as well as severance pay. The board should annually evaluate whether share or share price-related long-term incentive programs should be proposed to the general meeting.The fixed cash salary must be individual and based on the senior executive's areas of responsibility and experience.The variable cash compensation may amount to no more than 50 percent of the fixed annual cash salary.For senior executives  pension benefits must be defined contribution unless the executive is covered by a defined benefit pension according to mandatory collective agreement provisions. Variable cash compensation must be pensionable.The pension premiums for a defined contribution pension must amount to a maximum of 25 percent of the fixed annual cash salary  unless otherwise stipulated in the collective agreement. The board shall have the right to offer other solutions that are cost-equivalent for the company  regardless of the above.Other benefits may include i.a. company car and occupational health care. Such benefits must be of limited value in relation to other compensation and be consistent with what is market-wise customary in the respective geographic market. Other benefits may total no more than 15 percent of the fixed annual cash salary.Termination of employmentUpon termination of the senior executive's employment  a mutual notice period of no more than six months shall apply. As far as the CEO is concerned  however  the notice period in case of termination by the company can amount to a maximum of 12 months. Fixed cash salary should be paid during the notice period. As a starting point  severance payments or similar compensation shall not be paid.Criteria for distribution of variable cash compensation  etc.Variable cash compensation must be linked to predetermined and measurable criteria  which can be financial or non-financial  designed with the aim of promoting the company's long-term value creation. The criteria should relate to the development in the development projects the Company conducts and the partnerships the Company enters into for the acceleration of clinical development and future commercialization  as well as the compensation (for example  one-off payments at the conclusion of the agreement  milestone compensation  compensation for research services  or royalties) this development results in. The criteria must further be designed to promote Medivir's business strategy and long-term interests  including its sustainability.Fulfillment of criteria for payment of variable cash compensation must be measured over a period of one year. When the measurement period for fulfillment of criteria for the payment of variable cash compensation has ended  the extent to which the criteria have been fulfilled must be determined. The board is responsible for the assessment regarding variable cash compensation to senior executives. As far as financial targets are concerned  the assessment must be based on the financial information most recently published by the company.Salary and employment conditions for employeesWhen preparing the board's proposal for these remuneration guidelines  salary and employment conditions for the company's employees have been taken into account. Information regarding the employees' total remuneration  the components of the remuneration as well as the increase and rate of increase of the remuneration over time have formed part of the board's decision-making basis when evaluating the fairness of the guidelines and the restrictions that follow from these.The decision-making process for establishing  reviewing and implementing the guidelinesThe board has not set up a remuneration committee  but the tasks assigned to such a committee is carried out by the board of directors in its entirety. The board's proposal for guidelines for remuneration to senior executives has therefore been prepared by the board. The board must draw up proposals for new guidelines at least every four years and submit the proposal for decision at the annual general meeting. The guidelines shall apply until new guidelines are adopted by the general meeting. Since the board has not established a remuneration committee  the board is also responsible for following and evaluating programs for variable remuneration for group management  the application of guidelines for remuneration to senior executives and current remuneration structures and remuneration levels in the group. In the board's consideration of and decisions on remuneration-related matters  the CEO or other senior executives are not present  to the extent that they are affected by the matters.Deviation from the guidelinesThe board may decide to temporarily deviate from the guidelines in whole or in part  if in an individual case there are special reasons for it and a deviation is necessary to satisfy Medivir's long-term interests  including its sustainability  or to ensure Medivir's financial viability.Additional informationAdditional information regarding compensation to senior executives can be found in the annual report of Medivir.The board of directors' proposal on a share issue authorization (item 19)The board proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to authorize to the board  up and until the next annual general meeting  on one or several occasions and with or without pre-emptive rights for shareholders  to resolve on the issue of new ordinary shares  comprising a total of not more than 20 per cent of the total number of outstanding shares in the company after the utilization of the authorization. It shall also be possible to make such an issue resolution stipulating in-kind payment  the right to offset debt or other conditions referred to in Chapter 13 Section 5 first paragraph item 6 in the Swedish Companies Act. The purpose of the authorization is to give the board flexibility in the work of ensuring that capital can be added to the company in an appropriate manner for the financing of the business. Issuance of new shares with the support of the authorization must be carried out on market terms.The board of directors' proposal regarding a long-term incentive program in the form of a share matching program (LTIP 2024) (item 20)The board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to adopt a long-term incentive program in the form of a share matching program for key employees within the Medivir group in accordance with item 20(a) below. The resolution in accordance with item 20(a) shall be conditional upon the annual general meeting resolving to adopt the hedging arrangements with respect to the incentive program in accordance with the board of directors' proposal under item 20(b) below.Adoption of the incentive program (item 20(a))Summary of the programThe board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to adopt a long-term incentive program in the form of a share matching program (the ""LTIP 2024"").

The board considers that in these cases it is justified that the Vesting Period is shorter than three years since it enables the company to assign new employees Rights within the framework of LTIP 2024  which is deemed to be beneficial for the company from a recruitment perspective.The Performance Rights may be exercised provided that  in addition to the requirement for the participant's continued employment and a retained Investment Share investment in accordance with the above  certain performance conditions are fulfilled.

For allotment under the performance conditions  the TSR on the company's ordinary shares must amount to or exceed 50 per cent (corresponding to approximately 16.67 per cent per year) during the Performance Period  which would entitle the participant to one (1) Performance Share per Investment Share. In between the percentages  allotment will be made linearly. Performance Shares are received after the end of the Vesting Period.The RightsThe Rights shall  in addition to what is set out above  be governed by the following terms and conditions:The Rights are granted free of charge as soon as practicable after the start of LTIP 2024 provided that the participant has made a private investment by acquiring Investment Shares.

Each Performance Right entitles the participant to receive one (1) Matching Share free of charge after the end of the Vesting Period (with certain exceptions where the Vesting Period may be accelerated) if the performance conditions set out above are fulfilled and provided that the participant maintains its employment within the Medivir group and the invested Investment Shares during the Vesting Period.In order to align the participants' and the shareholders' interests  the company will compensate the participants for any dividends paid by increasing the number of Matching Shares and Performance Shares that the Rights entitle to at the end of the Vesting Period.The maximum value per Matching Right and Performance Right  respectively  is limited to a sum (corresponding to ten (10) times the closing price of the company's ordinary shares on the date of the first allocation of LTIP 2024). In the event that the value of such Right exceeds such limit  the number of Matching Shares and Performance Shares will be decreased on a pro rata basis.1 TSR is calculated by comparing the weighted average price of the shares during March 2024 with the weighted average price of the shares during March 2027  including reinvested dividend. according to the terms must be returned and can be granted again up until 31 December 2024Preparation and administrationThe board of directors shall be responsible for preparing the detailed terms and conditions of LTIP 2024  in accordance with the above terms and conditions  including provisions on recalculation in the event of a bonus issue  split  rights issue and/or other similar events.In connection with the preparation of the detailed terms and conditions of LTIP 2024  the board of directors shall also be entitled to make adjustments to meet foreign regulations or market conditions.

Participants may acquire Investment Shares to an amount corresponding to approximately 3–7 per cent of the participant's annual base salary.In case not all participants invest their full part of Investment Shares by the end of the notification period  the other participants are entitled to invest in additional a maximum of 50 per cent Investment Shares in accordance with the instructions of the board of directors  which shall entitle to the corresponding Rights. There will be no guaranteed allocation in connection with an investment in additional Investment Shares. In case of over notification by the above persons covered by the allotment principles  the allotment shall be made as follows. First  allocation shall be made pro rata in relation to the number of additional invested Investment Shares. Secondarily  allocation shall be made through the drawing of lots executed by the board of directors.Delivery of shares under LTIP 2024To ensure delivery of shares under LTIP 2024  the board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to authorize the board of directors to resolve on issue of shares of series C and on repurchase of shares of series C and resolves on transfer of own ordinary shares in accordance with item(b) below.Scope and costs of LTIP 2024LTIP 2024 will be accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2 which stipulates that the Rights should be recorded as non-cash personnel expenses during the period of LTIP 2024. The costs for LTIP 2024 is estimated to amount to approximately SEK 1.3 million  excluding social security costs  calculated in accordance with IFRS 2 based on the following assumptions: (i) that 240 000 Matching Rights and 1 200 000 Performance Shares are allotted  (ii) that the price of the company's share immediately before the start of LTIP 2024 amounts to SEK 2.73 per share (closing price on 8 March 2024)  (iii) an estimated annual turnover of personnel of 10 per cent and (iv) that the TSR during the Performance Period amounts to 75 per cent.The costs for social security charges are estimated to approximately SEK 1.1 million  based on the above assumptions and a social security tax rate of 31.42 per cent. Together with the IFRS 2 cost  this will result in estimated costs of SEK 2.4 million. In addition to what is set forth above  the costs for LTIP 2024 have been based on that LTIP 2024 comprises not more than 11 participants and that each participant exercises its maximum investment.Effects on key ratios and dilutionUpon maximum allotment of 240  000 Matching Shares  1  200 000 Performance Shares and provided that the hedging arrangements in accordance with item 20(b) below are adopted by the annual general meeting  1  460 000 ordinary shares will be allotted to participants under LTIP 2024  including a buffer of 20 000 ordinary shares for dividend compensations  meaning a dilution of approximately 1.28 per cent of the number of shares and votes in the company. In addition  LTIP 2024 comprises allotment of 240  000 Investment Shares to the participants at the volume weighted average share price during the five trading days immediately prior to the offer to each participant to acquire the Investment Shares  meaning a dilution of approximately 0.21 per cent of the number of shares and votes in the company. This is conditional upon the annual general meeting resolving to adopt the proposed hedging arrangements in accordance with item 20(b) below.Taking into account shares that may be issued in accordance with previously implemented incentive programs in the form of warrant programs in the company and in accordance with the share matching program proposed to the annual general meeting with respect to the maximum number of Matching Shares and Performance Shares  the maximal dilution effect is approximately 2.23 per cent.The costs of LTIP 2024 are expected to have a limited effect on the company's key ratios.The rationale for the proposalThe rationale for LTIP 2024 is to create conditions for motivating and retaining competent employees of the Medivir group as well as for the alignment of the targets of the participants with those of the company  as well as to increase the motivation of meeting and exceeding the company's financial targets. LTIP 2024 has been designed based on the view that it is desirable that key employees within the Medivir group are shareholders in the company. Participation in LTIP 2024 requires a personal investment in Investment Shares.By offering an allotment of Rights which  inter alia  are based on performance conditions  the participants are rewarded for increased shareholder value. Further  LTIP 2024 rewards employees' continued loyalty and thereby the long-term value growth in the company. Against this background  the board of directors is of the opinion that the adoption of LTIP 2024 will have a positive effect on the Medivir group's future development and thus be beneficial for both the company and its shareholders.Preparation of the matterThe principles of LTIP 2024 have been prepared by the board of directors of the company. The board of directors has thereafter resolved to submit this proposal to the annual general meeting. Except for the officials who prepared the matter pursuant to instructions from the board of directors  no employee that may be included in the program has taken part in the drafting thereof.Other share related incentive programs etc.Except from the current proposal to adopt a share matching program and the previous warrant programs resolved upon at the annual general meetings of 2021  2022  and the share matching program which was adopted at the annual general meeting of 2023 (LTIP 2023) the company has no outstanding share related incentive programs. It is the board of directors's intention that the program shall recur annually  albeit in varying sizes.Proposal regarding authorization for the board of directors to resolve on a directed share issue of shares of series C and to repurchase issued shares of series C as well as resolution on transfer of own ordinary shares to participants in LTIP 2023 and LTIP 2024 and in the market (item 20 (b))The resolutions under items 20 (b)(i) - (iii) are proposed to be conditional upon each other. It is therefore proposed that the resolutions under items 20 (b)(i) - (iii) are adopted jointly.Authorization for the board of directors to resolve on issue of shares of series C (item 20 (b)(i))The board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to authorize the board of directors  during the period until the next annual general meeting  at one or several occasions  to increase the company's share capital by not more than SEK 850  000 by the issue of not more than 1  700 000 shares of series C  each with a quota value of SEK 0.50. With deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights  a participating third party shall be entitled to subscribe for the new shares of series C at a subscription price corresponding to the quota value of the shares. The purpose of the authorization and the reason for the deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights in connection with the issue of shares is to enable for participants in LTIP 2024 to acquire Investment Shares  ensure delivery of shares under LTIP 2024 as well as to cover any social costs and dividend compensations due to LTIP 2023 and LTIP 2024.Authorization for the board of directors to resolve to repurchase own shares of series C (item 20 (b)(ii)) The board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to authorize the board of directors  during the period until the next annual general meeting  at one or several occasions  to repurchase shares of series C. The repurchase may only be effected through a public offer directed to all holders of shares of series C and shall comprise all outstanding shares of series C. The purchase may be effected at a purchase price corresponding to the quota value of the share. Payment for the shares of series C shall be made in cash. The purpose of the proposed repurchase authorization is to enable for participants in LTIP 2024 to acquire Investment Shares  ensure delivery of shares under LTIP 2024 as well as to cover any social costs due to LTIP 2024.Resolution on the transfer of own ordinary shares (item 20 (b)(iii))The board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves that 1  700 000 shares of series C that the company purchases by virtue of the authorization to repurchase shares of series C in accordance with item 20 (b)(ii) above  following reclassification into ordinary shares  may be transferred free of charge to participants in LTIP 2024 in accordance with resolved conditions and transferred to cover any social costs due to LTIP 2024.The board of directors thus proposes that the annual general meeting resolves that the maximum number of ordinary shares held by the company  including such ordinary shares that the company holds after previously completed repurchases  may be transferred to participants in accordance with the terms of LTIP 2024  and that it may be transferred on Nasdaq Stockholm  including through a financial intermediary  at a price within the price range registered at the time  to cover any social security contributions in accordance with the terms of LTIP 2023 and LTIP 2024. The number of shares that can be transferred is subject to recalculation as a result of an in-between bonus issue  share split  share split  rights issue and/or similar events.The board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves that 240 000 of the shares of series C that the company purchases by virtue of the authorization to repurchase shares of series C in accordance with item 20 (b)(ii) above  following reclassification into ordinary shares  may be transferred to employees in Medivir to enable for acquisitions of Investment Shares for participation in LTIP 2024. The board of directors therefore proposes that a maximum of 240 000 ordinary shares may be transferred to employees of Medivir. The transfer price shall amount to the volume weighted average share price during the five trading days immediately prior to the date of the offer to each participant to acquire Investment Shares.Majority requirementsA decision according to the proposal pursuant to item 19 above is valid only when supported by shareholders holding not less than two-thirds (2/3) of both the votes cast and of the shares represented at the annual general meeting. A decision according to the proposal pursuant to item 20 above is valid only when supported by shareholders holding not less than nine-tenths (9/10) of both the votes cast and of the shares represented at the annual general meeting.DocumentationThe annual report  the remuneration report and other supporting documentation for resolutions will be available at the company's offices  Medivir AB  Lunastigen 5  SE-141 22 Huddinge  Sweden no later than three weeks prior to the meeting.

Under the partnership  all 31 of RLS’s radiopharmacies will be equipped with Eckert & Ziegler’s advanced GalliaPharm® generators  which the radiopharmacy network will utilize to produce high-quality  life-enhancing Gallium-68-based (Ga-68) radiopharmaceuticals. Ga-68 is crucial for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging and plays a pivotal role in the accurate diagnosis and subsequent treatment planning for patients with neuroendocrine tumors and prostate cancer.""To help meet the ever-increasing demand for precision diagnostics in cancer treatment  we are collaborating with Eckert & Ziegler to place advanced Ga-68 radiolabeling technology into the hands of all our skilled radiopharmacists nationwide "" said RLS CEO Stephen Belcher. ""A powerful diagnostic isotope  Gallium has an extremely short half-life  necessitating the need for Ga-68-based radiopharmaceuticals to be produced within minutes of patient dosing. By bringing Eckert & Ziegler’s GalliaPharm® generators into our network  we are closing the patient care gap in many parts of the U.S. This signifies a major leap forward in our commitment to advancing healthcare and improving patient outcomes through cutting-edge radiopharmaceuticals.""To date  RLS has installed Eckert & Ziegler’s GalliaPharm® generators within most of its locations and anticipates the remaining radiopharmacies will be operational by the end of June. All of RLS’s radiopharmacies house cutting-edge clean rooms and are fully equipped and aligned to USP <797>  USP <825> and ISO 14644-1 compliance standards  which guarantees Ga-68-radiolabeled products are produced to the highest standard possible. Additionally  each location is led by experienced nuclear pharmacists  who  along with nuclear technicians  in-house couriers and a robust delivery fleet  ensure every order is meticulously prepared  dispensed and distributed. RLS is also investing in the future by building a national distributed rCDMO network. 80 000 sq. ft. of space across eight of its pharmacies will be used for radiopharmaceutical development  manufacturing and the production of medical isotopes such as Gallium-68  Actinium-225 and Lutetium-177. RLS now offers Ga-68-based radiolabeling  custom compounding  patient dose preparation and last-mile delivery.Story continues""We are pleased to be a trusted partner to RLS in their strategic decision to improve the nationwide supply of the important Ga-68-based diagnostics and to equip their radiopharmacies with our GalliaPharm® "" said Jay Simon  managing director of Eckert & Ziegler Radiopharma  Inc. ""The demand for radiopharmaceuticals continues to grow in the U.S. and around the world  with many promising drugs in clinical trials. As the number of products increases  the flexibility that our generator provides in the production of Ga-68 will be an even greater asset than before.""Ga-68 from GalliaPharm® generators is used in the preparation of radiodiagnostics for neuroendocrine tumors and prostate cancer (Ga-68-PSMA) in countries all around the world. The generator offers a low-cost alternative for the radiolabeling of biomolecules with Gallium-68 in PET  an imaging examination method used to detect the presence or absence of diseased tissue. PET Imaging is primarily used in the diagnosis of cancer  heart attacks or neurological diseases. Radioisotopes such as Fluorine-18 can be used alternatively but require investments of millions of dollars in large-scale equipment (cyclotrons). The Ge-68/Ga-68 generator on the other hand  is an easily transportable  small metal box and can be obtained much more cost-efficient  leading to cost reductions in nuclear medicine clinics and practices while increasing flexibility.About RLS RadiopharmaciesRLS is America’s only Joint Commission-accredited radiopharmacy network  with 31 radiopharmacies covering more than 85% of the population.

The publication can be accessed here.Dr. Jeffrey Testani  Associate professor at Yale University and senior author of the publication commented: “Cardiorenal syndrome is a major clinical challenge in heart failure with a clear unmet need for therapies to effectively and durably address congestion and cardio-renal dysfunction. Currently the mainstay of therapy for sodium avidity and congestion are the loop diuretics  which actually worsen sodium avidity and cardiorenal syndrome. In the RED DESERT and SAHARA studies  patients’ loop diuretics were completely replaced by DSR therapy for several weeks  resulting in an improvement in a multitude of metrics of cardiorenal health and a dramatic and durable improvement in their diuretic responsiveness and chronic loop diuretic requirements. This data is truly revolutionary  representing really the first and only novel therapeutic approach to treat diuretic resistance and cardiorenal syndrome in heart failure.”Ian Crosbie  Chief Executive Officer of Sequana Medical  added: “We are delighted with Dr. Testani’s publication highlighting DSR as a potential treatment for cardio-renal syndrome  highlighting the need to break the vicious cycle of loop diuretic therapy. Diuretic-resistant heart failure and cardiorneal syndrome are large and growing markets both in the US and rest of world  with the clear need for novel treatments that can improve clinical outcomes beyond loop diuretics. We believe DSR’s ability to virtually eliminate the need for loop diuretics for many months post-treatment represents a breakthrough in treatment options  and address one of the leading drivers of healthcare costs.”In total  18 patients with heart failure on high dose oral loop diuretics were enrolled in the RED DESERT and SAHARA clinical studies and received DSR therapy for up to four and six weeks respectively  whilst their loop diuretics were withheld. Data from these studies indicated that DSR could i) safely  effectively and rapidly eliminate fluid overload and restore euvolemia without the need of any loop diuretics; ii) deliver a considerable benefit in patients’ cardiorenal health; and iii) deliver a dramatic and sustained improvement in diuretic responsiveness  thereby dramatically reducing the need for oral loop diuretics for many months post-therapy. In both RED DESERT and SAHARA studies  there were no congestion-related hospital readmissions  all patients improved their NYHA status by at least one class  and and the clinical benefits observed in the clinical studies resulted in a 75% reduction in predicted one-year mortality of patients pre- vs. post-intensive DSR therapy based on the Seattle Heart Failure Model.For more information  please contact:Sequana MedicalLies VannesteDirector Investor RelationsE: IR@sequanamedical.comT: +32 (0)498 053579About DSR  a disease-modifying heart failure drug therapy tackling cardiorenal syndrome (CRS)Cardiorenal syndrome is a key clinical challenge in heart failure and results from the combined vicious cycle of dysfunction of the heart and kidney. Despite the complex pathophysiology  the resultant clinical profile is thought to manifest as a self-reinforcing negative feedback cycle characterized by decreased glomerular filtration  increased renal sodium avidity  and congestion  despite escalating diuretic doses.No current therapies have been shown to improve patient outcomes in this complex and poorly understood indication. Reducing congestion is a key element of therapy but loop diuretics exacerbate many of the core mechanisms thought to underly CRS. Through effective control of the volume status for an extended period of time and thereby avoiding the negative consequences of loop diuretics  DSR has the potential to break the negative feedback cycle of this clinical challenge.Extensive analysis of patients in the RED DESERT and SAHARA studies shows the benefit from DSR therapy on i) volume status  ii) normalized diuretic response and dramatically reduced loop diuretic dosing  iii) improvement in kidney function  iv) neurohormonal status and signalling  as well as v) cardiovascular parameters. In these patients there were no congestion-related re-hospitalizations  a one class improvement in their NYHA status and a reduction of 75% in their predicated one-year mortality (based on the Seattle Heart Failure model). Initial data from the non-randomized cohort in the US MOJAVE study support these findings and indicated that DSR is safe and well tolerated  restores diuretic response and improves cardio-renal health.About Sequana MedicalSequana Medical NV is a pioneer in treating fluid overload  a serious and frequent clinical complication in patients with liver disease  heart failure and cancer. This causes major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care  they become ineffective  untolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing ""diuretic-resistant"" patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  delivering major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients and reducing costs for healthcare systems.The Company's Premarket Approval (PMA) application for the alfapump was submitted to the US FDA in December 2023 and accepted for substantive review in January 2024  having reported positive primary and secondary endpoint data from the North American pivotal POSEIDON study in recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis.Results of the Company's RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure support DSR's mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE  a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study  have been successfully treated with DSR  resulting in a dramatic improvement in diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements. The independent Data Safety Monitoring Board approved the start of the randomized MOJAVE cohort of up to a further 30 patients  which is planned after alfapump US PMA approval.Sequana Medical is listed on Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent  Belgium.

The reconsideration process will re-examine  with new assessors  the decision based on information that was included in the original submission.A Notice of Deficiency-Withdrawal (NOD/w) was issued on February 19  2024 by Health Canada regarding the New Drug Submission (NDS) for masitinib in the treatment of ALS. The intention to submit a reconsideration request was based on the arguments summarized in the press release dated 26 February 2024.Health Canada and AB Science have held a meeting to discuss the reconsideration process. AB Science is working closely with the agency to facilitate the review of masitinib conditional approval in ALS. AB Science has 45 days to file the reconsideration request.The pivotal argument is on the treatment of missing data. Various sensitivity analyses show that study AB10015 was successful at week 48 when masitinib missing data are imputed as a placebo  which is recognized as a highly conservative methodology for missing data imputation (i.e.  jump-to-reference). Rerandomization calculation  which ignores whether the data distribution is linear or not  was also successful. Furthermore  the Combined Assessment of Function and Survival (CAFS) analysis showed a p-value of 0.078  even though study AB10015 was not powered for this endpoint. A related time-to-event endpoint  Progression Free Survival (PFS)  did show significant improvement in favor of masitinib. Additionally  in the subgroup of patients with ‘ALS prior to any loss of function’  a logically defined cohort based on masitinib’s mechanism of action  a long-term median overall survival (OS) benefit of +22 months (p=0.0192) was observed.Professor Albert Ludolph  MD  PhD  Medical Director of the Neurology Department of at the University of Ulm  and principal investor of masitinib confirmatory study in ALS commented that  “The recent failure of numerous phase 2 or 3 programs  including registered drugs such as AMX0035 (Amylyx) and oral edaravone (Ferrer)  as well as investigational drugs such as TUDCA (the TUDCA-ALS consortium)  reldesemtiv (Cytokinetics) and the RIPK1 inhibitor SAR443820 (Sanofi)  have dashed the community's hopes of benefiting from new therapeutic advances and have effectively set us back with riluzole being the only treatment with a proven modest effect in the overall ALS population. We should learn from theses failures. First  that demonstration of efficacy over a 24-week period is not predictive of efficacy over a 48-week period  which is the adequate duration to demonstrate a disease modifying effect in ALS. Second  that a 48-week study inevitably generates a large number of missing data. This situation is not unique to masitinib. It is a real challenge in the evaluation of efficacy and we are at risk of overlooking promising compounds. Masitinib has published results over a 48-week period  positive when appropriate methodology to treat missing data is applied  and it deserves careful consideration”.About AB ScienceFounded in 2001  AB Science is a pharmaceutical company specializing in the research  development and commercialization of protein kinase inhibitors (PKIs)  a class of targeted proteins whose action are key in signaling pathways within cells.

The U.S. operations represent a valuable source of know-how from which to draw on in all geographical areas where regulations have evolvedV…,Veolia is at the forefront of the fight against PFAS in drinking water in the United States. The U.S. operations represent a valuable source of know-how from which to draw on in all geographical areas where regulations have evolved Veolia has already treated a cumulative 2.1 billion gallons of water in New York  New Jersey and Pennsylvania across more than 30 sites  with dozens more underway With the launch of the 30th PFAS treatment project  covering 17 additional wells in New York State  Veolia has now deployed treatment capacities to supply water with the regulated PFAS levels below regulatory thresholds to more than 140 000 AmericansRegulatory News:Veolia (Paris:VIE)  the largest private operator of water services in the United States  has reached a new milestone in its treatment of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) chemicals in America’s drinking water  with more than 30 sites now reporting no detectable levels of regulated PFAS chemicals. The advanced effort includes new treatment installed at 17 drinking water wells in the state of New York  with construction underway on additional projects in four states as Veolia continues to address PFAS contamination in drinking water supplies across the country.PFAS contamination in drinking water is a critical challenge due to its widespread presence and persistent nature. The U.S. has been one of the forerunners in the fight against this problem  with regulations in place in several states and the imminent introduction by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) of the first mandatory rules requiring treatment of certain PFAS in drinking water systems.Using its global experience  Veolia is able to treat regulated PFAS at scale with proven systems based on its expertise in technologies such as activated carbon or nanofiltration  while evaluating more advanced treatment materials and innovating new treatment technologies. In the U.S. Veolia  as a leading regulated utility and operator of municipal water systems  has moved quickly to provide effective solutions for communities affected by PFAS contamination in drinking water. To date  Veolia has treated more than 2.1 billion gallons of drinking water in the country using more than 1 million pounds of granular activated carbon and other materials that separate regulated PFAS and other contaminants from water  reducing their levels below the regulatory thresholds.Suitable treatment is essential to help separate PFAS from drinking water effectively  and Veolia has conducted almost 10 000 water sample analyses in the U.S. in the past five years to determine and implement the best treatment options across a range of source water chemistries  physical site constraints and equipment lifecycle costs.In all the geographies concerned  where the regulatory framework has moved towards a proactive approach to dealing with PFAS  Veolia wants to draw on the operational expertise acquired in the United States as well as on its research capacities across the world to fight against PFAS pollution and other micropollutants  in order to offer an efficient and affordable solution at scale.“The fight against PFAS pollution is a concrete example of Veolia delivering innovative ecological solutions to the challenge of depollution. In the United States  where regulations have evolved more rapidly than in Europe  we have more than 50 additional projects at various stages to meet the new standards. With our worldwide expertise in cutting-edge water treatment technologies  the United States represents a land of solutions from which all our geographies could benefit ” said Estelle Brachlianoff  Veolia CEO. “It is crucial to tackle the challenge of PFAS in drinking water without delay  and this requires strong regulatory support. Addressing this issue demands coordinated efforts across sectors and across the entire PFAS value chain to ensure compliant drinking water in the relevant areas. Veolia is proud to be leading the way in mobilizing its expertise to advance the treatment of PFAS  thereby helping to improve public health.”“Veolia is a leader in providing solutions to both the public and industry to address environmental challenges  with PFAS as the perfect example. Using existing and innovative treatment technologies  as well as our expertise in executing and delivering complex projects  Veolia is providing a cleaner environment by addressing regulated PFAS contaminants in water ” said Fred Van Heems  President and Chief Executive Officer of Veolia North America.In New York  Veolia began working closely with local authorities to launch a robust PFAS management plan for drinking water wells in 2019  anticipating the standards developed by New York State and the EPA for those chemicals. Veolia has also installed treatment systems for drinking water wells in its service territory in neighboring New Jersey and in Pennsylvania. Throughout this effort  Veolia has shown its unique ability to tackle the novel and complex task of dealing with PFAS in drinking water.ABOUT VEOLIAVeolia's ambition is to become the benchmark company for ecological transformation.

This benefits the researcher by producing richer verbatims and increasing productivity. Now  BARI is also available to assist with quantitative projects.Raising the potential of open-ended questions with automated moderationIn theory  open-ended questions in quantitative research greatly enhance the richness and depth of data. In practice  however  participants in quantitative research tend to provide minimalistic answers that lack the depth found in responses from qualitative studies. The automated AI moderation of open-ended answers done by BARI significantly increases the length of responses. BARI asks relevant follow-up questions to the participants’ answers  always specific to the conversation flow  resulting in more detailed and genuine verbatims. BARI is available 24/7  always engaged  polite and speaks over 20 languages.AI-automated quality checks for authentic and relevant verbatimsBased on our proprietary algorithms and LLM-based AI models  BARI automatically checks the participants’ answers to open-ended questions to ensure their authenticity and relevance. Any respondents falling short of our stringent quality benchmarks are promptly identified and flagged for removal from the dataset. This seamless integration of quality assurance protocols is consistently deployed across all our projects  ensuring best-in-class reliability and precision in our services.Effortless data processing: BARI helps with automated codingHistorically  open-ended questions have often been omitted as analysis can be tedious and expensive. However  BARI now facilitates the efficient analysis of the verbatims gathered in open-ended answers  whether external data or data collected by Bilendi. BARI automatically suggests a coding plan for the verbatims. Once validated  BARI delivers codified verbatims that are as easy to analyse as quantitative data. BARI understands the semantics of the data as well as the underlying meaning  enabling the researcher to have a fast  but profound understanding of participants’ answers. BARI can code thousands of verbatims in different languages within a few hours  and with the same quality standards across multiple countries.Gain a deeper understanding of participants with a qualitative deep-dive following a quantitative projectBARI also supports quantitative researchers who need a better understanding of a specific sub-group - a qualitative deep-dive conducted via the Bilendi Discuss platform. Participants can be invited on the fly  based on pre-defined criteria  or selected after analysing the quantitative survey data. The following qualitative survey may initially contain up to 5 questions and will be automatically moderated by BARI  resulting in even deeper insights. Participants can answer via their preferred social messengers (for example WhatsApp or Messenger)  using diverse response types (text  images  audio and video)  resulting in longer and more spontaneous answers. As is already the case with the Bilendi Discuss platform  following the qualitative deep-dive  BARI delivers precise summaries of the participants’ answers and a human-level analysis of the results. The analysis is backed up with the respective verbatims  proving its accuracy and relevance. Qualitative research within a quantitative project - for a deeper understanding of the respondents.Marc Bidou  CEO and founder of Bilendi  states:“Clients often ask when our AI-powered research assistant will be available for quantitative projects. Today  we are happy to announce the launch of “AI for quant”  which incorporates BARI’s skills. BARI has equal-to-human moderation skills but with the big advantage of being available 24/7  whenever participants are online. This constant availability and professionalism significantly increases the quality of the answers. Utilising BARI’s capabilities in quantitative  as well as qualitative surveys  was a logical step in our strategy of using innovative technology to provide qualitative research solutions to our clients. AI is an important component. We are constantly working on further developments and will soon be able to present further innovations.”Next publication: Q1 2024 revenues published on 14 May 2024 (after market close)About BilendiAt a time when the volume  variety and speed of data transmitted and exchanged are increasing exponentially  Bilendi provides an innovative technological response to data collection  management and enhancement.

Founded in 2009  it brings together companies  trade associations  research institutes and government organisations involved in the biogas sector.The EBA's main missions include representing the interests of the industry to public authorities  promoting biogas  participating in the development of public policy  educating  and raising awareness  and supporting biogas research and innovation  promoting the development of new technologies and best practices for the industry.In summary  the European Biogas Association plays a key role in the promotion and development of biogas in Europe  working towards a more sustainable and environmentally friendly energy future.By joining the EBA  BOOSTHEAT is giving its disruptive technology tremendous visibility and providing a solution to a sector in search of innovation. Joining the EBA is one more element in the realization of BOOSTHEAT's development activities in the methanisation sector in France and internationally.I TECHNOLOGY TO MEET THE CHALLENGES OF BIOGAS PRODUCTIONOver the past few months  BOOSTHEAT has demonstrated the benefits of hybrid compression technology for significantly improving biogas recovery in anaerobic digestion plants. BOOSTHEAT has positioned itself in this market with a disruptive micro-cogeneration technology offering a much higher overall efficiency than conventional solutions  thanks to the free energy provided by the heat pump effect inherent in BOOSTHEAT compressor technology.The technology developed by BOOSTHEAT offers 3 major advantages:The primary energy required is supplied by the combustion of the biogas  so there is no loss in the energy chain  unlike with electrical energy. BOOSTHEAT technology helps to heat the anaerobic process  which must be kept at a constant 42°C during the anaerobic digestion cycle. Thanks to the 150% efficiency of the hybrid compressor  the operator reduces gas consumption compared with conventional boiler or cogeneration solutions  which have efficiencies of 90%. The operator guarantees 100% renewable primary energy  while electricity partly of fossil origin  by using the biogas produced by the methanisation process as fuel.Thanks to these advantages  BOOSTHEAT announced last February that it had received a letter of intent from a French industrial player in the field of micro-methanisation to exploit the exceptional characteristics of its brand-new hybrid compressor.Mieke Decorte  EBA's Technical Director  said: ""The European Biogas Association welcomes BOOSTHEAT as a new member. In order to achieve carbon neutrality in the EU  biogas is a key vector for generating renewable energy.Innovation will be crucial to unlock the full production potential of the industry and offer solutions to meet the challenges of the sector. The hybrid compression technology proposed by BOOSTHEAT represents an interesting solution to increase the efficiency and flexibility of anaerobic digestion (AD) plants  and underlines BOOSTHEAT's commitment to deliver cutting-edge innovations in the energy field.""Emilien Benhard  BOOSTHEAT's Director of Operations  added: ""With its European scope  the EBA will play a decisive role in promoting our technology to European biogas players. With initial national industry support in this new market  we are optimistic about BOOSTHEAT's path to contribute to the biogas sector with our new hybrid compressor. We look forward to sharing future results  confirming the effectiveness and potential of our innovation for a greener and more sustainable economy on a European scale with the support of EBA.""* * *Find out more about BOOSTHEAT atwww.boostheat-group.comABOUT BOOSTHEATFounded in 2011  BOOSTHEAT is a player in the energy efficiency sector.

Photograph: Spencer Platt/Getty ImagesInclusion in US stock indices is a “key objective” motivating Flutter Entertainment’s proposed transfer of its primary listing to New York  chair John Bryant has told shareholders.The Irish gambling giant  which is parent to Paddy Power and Betfair on this side of the Atlantic  cancelled its listing on Euronext Dublin in January and started trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)  with its primary listing remaining in London.At the company’s annual general meeting on May 1st  shareholders are set to vote on a resolution to approve the transfer of that primary listing from London to New York.In a letter to shareholders in advance of the agm  Flutter chair John Bryant outlined the reasons why New York is the “optimal location” for Flutter’s primary listing.READ MORE[ Gambling law should not ban incentives  says Flutter ]He said the board believed the transfer would “further unlock long-term strategic and capital market benefits” that were already being realised by the US listing. These include enhancing Flutter’s profile in the US  greater access to deeper capital markets and US domestic investors including through eligibility for listing on US indices  and greater liquidity for Flutter shares.Flutter has already voluntarily adopted a number of US reporting requirements to attract investment from domestic US funds and compete with US peers.Mr Bryant said that meeting domestic reporting requirements and maintaining a primary US listing are both eligibility requirements for inclusion on “important US stock indices  which is a major driver of domestic US fund ownership”.“The orderly transition to indexation on US indices is a key objective of the company ” he said.He acknowledged that inclusion in US indices was “unlikely to be achieved in the very near term”  as the company had to demonstrate it meets eligibility criteria  but said the strategic and capital markets advantages of a primary US listing “outweigh these short-term considerations”.[ Betting and gambling may be different but it’s a tough distinction to sell to government ]The resolution will need to be approved by at least 75 per cent of voting shareholders in order to pass. In April last year  more than 99 per cent of Flutter shareholders voted in favour of establishing the US listing.If passed  Flutter has said it anticipates the transfer of its primary listing to New York will happen on May 31st.The transfer of the primary listing to the US would mean Flutter would no longer be eligible for inclusion in UK stock indices such as the FTSE 100.Mr Bryant said that Flutter would maintain its standard listing in London “for as long as it is considered to be in the best interests of Flutter and Flutter shareholders as a whole”.Flutter will remain incorporated and headquartered in Ireland and resident in Ireland for tax purposes.,neutral,0.02,0.96,0.01,negative,0.06,0.46,0.48,True,English,"['US index inclusion', 'Flutter plan', 'primary listing', 'domestic US fund ownership', 'New York Stock Exchange', 'important US stock indices', 'UK stock indices', 'annual general meeting', 'capital market benefits', 'deeper capital markets', 'capital markets advantages', 'domestic reporting requirements', 'US domestic investors', 'domestic US funds', 'US reporting requirements', 'Irish gambling giant', 'chair John Bryant', 'primary US listing', 'US indices', 'US peers', 'eligibility requirements', 'Mr Bryant', 'primary listing', 'Spencer Platt', 'Getty Images', 'key objective', 'Paddy Power', 'Euronext Dublin', 'May 1st', 'optimal location', 'Gambling law', 'greater access', 'greater liquidity', 'major driver', 'orderly transition', 'near term', 'short-term considerations', 'tough distinction', '75 per cent', '99 per cent', 'May 31st', 'standard listing', 'best interests', 'tax purposes', 'Flutter chair', 'eligibility criteria', 'long-term strategic', 'voting shareholders', 'Flutter Entertainment', 'Flutter shares', 'Flutter shareholders', 'Photograph', 'Inclusion', 'transfer', 'parent', 'Betfair', 'Atlantic', 'January', 'NYSE', 'London', 'company', 'resolution', 'letter', 'advance', 'agm', 'reasons', 'READ', 'incentives', 'board', 'profile', 'number', 'investment', 'indexation', 'Betting', 'government', 'April', 'favour', 'FTSE', 'Ireland']",2024-04-03,2024-04-04,irishtimes.com

As the OTT world’s first interactive advertising technology available to all streaming platforms  Click2 enables viewers to interact with ads as they are watching video streaming services  opening up a new type of ad inventory for video service providers. Leveraging the Click2 feature on broadpeak.io Dynamic Ad Insertion service  video service providers can significantly boost viewer engagement and monetization for video streaming services.“As the video streaming market continues to evolve  targeted advertising has become a critical component for monetization ” said Jacques Le Mancq  chief executive officer at Broadpeak. “With our new Click2 technology  we are pioneering a targeted advertising transformation — bringing interactive advertisements into the streaming world  opening up opportunities for more advertisers  and driving additional revenue for video service providers.”Broadpeak’s state-of-the-art Click2 technology boosts the performance of targeted advertising guaranteeing clicks for advertisers. Click2 allows viewers to click directly on banner ads within the video stream on their devices — including connected TVs  smart TVs  and Android TVs. After clicking on the ad  viewers receive a notification or SMS on their phone or other mobile device with information about the product featured in the ad and an opportunity to purchase it. Click2 ensures a premium user experience  allowing viewers to simultaneously keep watching video streaming services while looking at branded products on their companion device.“This is a real game changer for advertisers and video streaming platforms  bringing opportunities similar to what is done in the world of web advertising to OTT  with click-through and other indicators that measure the performance of ads ” said Mathias Guille  vice president cloud platform at Broadpeak. “We are proud and excited to offer this feature on our broadpeak.io SaaS platform soon.”With Click2  video service providers can start charging for ads per click instead of per impression  opening up additional revenue streams. Click2 makes it easy to create clickable video streaming ads at scale without requiring any work from the advertiser or agency side. Video service providers simply leverage the existing standard instream ad to generate interactive ads. Furthermore  Click2 provides advertisers with performance indicators about the ad  not just impressions  increasing the value of targeted advertising.Broadpeak will demonstrate the benefits of its new Click2 technology at the 2024 NAB Show  April 14-17 in booth W2529.

The 2023 consolidated financial statements of the Solutions30 group as approved by the Management Board were examined by the Supervisory Board on April 3  2024. The statutory auditor  PKF Audit & Conseil  has substantially performed its audit of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31  2023. The auditor’s report to certify these consolidated statements will be issued after verifying the management and corporate governance reports and the completion of procedures needed for the annual report. The group’s 2023 consolidated financial statements are available on its website www.solutions30.com.Gianbeppi Fortis  Chief Executive Officer of Solutions30  stated: “In 2023  for our twentieth anniversary  we reached our symbolic target of one billion euros of revenue  as planned. All our business indicators have shown clear improvement. After a difficult and decisive period that has only made it stronger  the group returned to a sustained growth trajectory with improved margins in 2023. In the fourth quarter  the Benelux became our top geographic area in terms of revenue and margins  establishing itself as a powerful driver of value creation. In France  the situation has remained mixed  with a mature fiber market and an energy market that is still growing  especially in the solar sector. We will continue to adapt our business model there to prioritize resource flexibility  process optimization  and cost reduction. As for other countries  we have begun to expand in Germany and have had major commercial successes in the fiber segment  which should become an important growth driver for the group in 2024. While margins were under pressure in the first half of the year from costs related to the ramp-up of certain contracts  the second half of the year confirmed our increased profitability. We returned to double-digit EBITDA margins in the Benelux and saw significant improvements in France  where our operational optimization efforts are paying off. As Solutions30 enters a new phase of profitable growth  we are confident that the group has the capacity to reach our target of a double-digit EBITDA margin and to seize the many opportunities presented by the digital transformation and the energy transition.”Key figures – Consolidated dataKey figures from the income statement (€ millions) 2023 2022 Change Revenue 1 057.0 904.6 16.8 % Operating costs 887.9 774.3 14.7 % As a % of revenue 84.0 % 85.6 % Central org. costs 94.8 83.6 13.4 % As a % of revenue 9.0 % 9.2% Adjusted EBITDA 74.6 46.7 59.6 % As a % of revenue 7.1% 5.2 % Adjusted EBIT 22.6 (0.3) -8097.2 % As a % of revenue 2.1% — % Net income  group share (22.7) (50.1) -54.6 % As a % of revenue (2.2%) (5.5%) Financial position (€ millions) 31.12.2023 31.12.2022 Change Equity 124.6 145.3 (20.7) Net debt 78.4 38.9 +39.6 Net bank debt (5.7) (54.0) +48.3 Free cash flow 13.4 37.2 (23.8)In 2023  the group’s consolidated revenue amounted to €1.057 billion  up +16.8% compared to 2022. This represents organic growth of +16.5%. Throughout the year  growth was driven by excellent momentum in the Benelux  where Solutions30 consolidated its position as one of the leaders in deploying ultra-fast Internet networks (FTTH)  while also making significant investments in the energy sector. In the other countries segment  revenue was up slightly  while slightly down in France  as the fiber market reached maturity and the Linky meter roll-out came to an end.Adjusted EBITDA stood at €74.6 million  rebounding by +59.6% from 2022 levels. 2023 also saw a clear improvement in the adjusted EBITDA margin  which came in at 7.1%  compared to 5.2% in 2022 (+190 basis points). As announced  this improvement is the result of strong growth in the second half of the year across all three geographic areas  with a consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin of 8.8%  compared to 3.7% in the second half of 2022 (+510 basis points)  and even exceeding the second half of 2021 (7.6%). This adjusted EBITDA margin was also higher than during the first half of 2023 (5.3%)  confirming the gradual improvement we have seen throughout the year.The group’s financial structure remains solid  with €5.7 million in cash net of debt at the end of 2023.Analysis by geographical area2023 2022 Change France Revenue 403.3 425.9 (5.3)% Adjusted EBITDA 35.5 20.8 +70.7% Adjusted EBITDA margin % 8.8% 4.9% Benelux Revenue 381.6 221.9 +72.0% Adjusted EBITDA 43.6 28.4 +53.5% Adjusted EBITDA margin % 11.4% 12.8% Other countries Revenue 272.1 256.8 +6.0% Adjusted EBITDA 5.5 7.1 (22.5)% Adjusted EBITDA margin % 2.0% 2.8% HQ* (10.0) (9.7) +3.1% Revenue 1 057.0 904.6 +16.8% Adjusted EBITDA 74.6 46.7 +59.7% Adjusted EBITDA margin % 7.1% 5.2%*Fees related to the group’s centralized functionsIn France  revenue amounted to €403.3 million  down 5.3% (-6.0% organic growth).The Connectivity business  which focuses mostly on fiber  was down 6.3% in a mature market where operators  service providers  and subcontractors have changed the way they collaborate to protect their business models over the long term.The Energy business is stable  with the positive impact from integrating ELEC ENR balanced by a 6.7% decrease in organic growth. Now that smart meter installations are winding down  the segment is pivoting to solar panel installation  driven by a renewable energy law passed in March 2023. In the fourth quarter  revenue from this business grew by 49% (+31% organic growth)  as new dynamics settled into place.The Technology business shrank by -4.2% as major French customers reduced their post-COVID IT spending.Adjusted EBITDA for France was €35.5 million  up sharply by +70.7% for a margin of 8.8%  compared to 4.9% in 2022. In the second half of the year  the margin was 9.6%  an improvement over the 7.9% during the first half of the year  as expected  and rebounding strongly from the second half of 2022. This positive momentum is built on the successful reorganization and efficiency measures that were implemented in 2022.Revenue in the Benelux was €381.6 million  with purely organic growth +72.0%.The Connectivity business grew by +86.1%  driven by high activity levels in deploying and connecting fiber optics.The Energy business grew by +39.0% as smart meter deployments in Flanders continue  while activities related to the energy transition - especially for electric mobility  renewable energy  and smart grids - are expanding.The Technology business grew by +15.7%  driven by new offerings  notably in the security segment.Adjusted EBITDA for the Benelux stood at €43.6 million  up sharply by +53.5%. The corresponding margin was 11.4% in 2023  down 140 basis points from 12.8% in 2022. After the first half of the year saw costs impacted by new contract ramp-ups (9.7% margin)  the Benelux returned to a double-digit margin of 12.9% in the second half of the year. This performance highlights the success of the group’s business model  which relies on reaching a critical size to create important economies of scale.In other countries  the group generated €272.1 million in revenue in 2023  up by +6.0%. This growth was mostly driven by Poland (+47.3%) and England (+8%). Germany began to see growth (+2.2% for the full year) thanks to major commercial successes in the fiber segment in 2023. The entire geographic area should become a significant source of growth for the group starting in 2024. Spain and Italy were down by 5.0% and -3.1% respectively as the group decided to focus on its most profitable activities and to wait for one of the market-leading operators in Italy to announce a new strategic orientation.Adjusted EBITDA stood at €5.5 million  down 22.5%. This decrease includes a first half of the year that was slightly negative  followed by a €6.3 million contribution in the second half of the year  up +33.6% compared to the second half of 2022. In Italy specifically  adjusted EBITDA margin improved materially in the second half. The group has entered into negotiations with its main customer with the aim of resolving difficulties related to the invoicing process and Solutions30 Italia SRL is under temporary legal protection measures from its suppliers. Depending on the outcome of these negotiations  the group will review all its options for improving its performance and where applicable  reducing its exposure to the country. In the latter scenario  the impact on the company’s accounts would be approximately -€5 million.Consolidated earningsGroup adjusted EBITDA for 2023 stood at €74.6 million  rising sharply from €46.7 million in 2022. As discussed in detail above  this performance was due to a significant gradual improvement of the adjusted EBITDA in the second half of 2023  increasing to €47.1 million from €27.5 million in the first half of the year and €17.1 million in the second half of 2022. Such marked improvements in the second half of 2023 were seen across all the group’s geographic areas.The group was able to bring operational costs under control  reducing them to 84.0% of revenue in 2023 from 85.6% in 2022  while structural costs fell to 9.0% of revenue in 2023 from 9.2% a year earlier.After accounting for €22.8 million in depreciation and operational provisions (compared to €18.9 million in 2022)  and after amortizing the usage rights for leased assets (IFRS 16)  worth €29.2 million  nearly the same as in 2022  adjusted EBIT stood at €22.6 million  compared to near-zero levels in 2022.Operating income  while remaining slightly negative at -€2.7 million in 2023  still saw on improvement compared to 2022 (-€26.5 million). Notably  it did see a positive uptick in the second half of 2023 for the first time in two and a half years  reaching €3.7 million thanks to much higher group operating margins.Operating income for 2023 notably included:€11.4 million in non-current operating expenses  nearly the same as in 2022. They mainly consist of restructuring costs of €8.3 million for the final stages of the transformation plan initiated in 2022 in France  organizational transformation measures in Germany to prepare for the start-up of the fiber business  and the exit from an unprofitable former consortium in Belgium. This item also includes the cost of the long-term incentive plan  which is now worthless (€1.3 million  with no cash impact).€14.4 million in customer relationship amortization  with no change from 2022.Financial income was negative at -€13.1 million  although this was an improvement over the net expense of -€17.1 million in 2022. This included €7.2 million in interest charges  up from 2022 (€2.7 million) due to rising interest rates and the amount drawn from new lines of credit. Also included were -€0.8 million of non-cash items related to earnout value adjustments for past acquisitions  compared to -€11.0 million in 2022.After accounting for a net tax expense of -€1.8 million after taxes from group-level tax loss carryforwards  as well as the deduction of €5.2 million in minority interests  the group share of net income amounted to -€22.7 million  less than half of the loss seen in 2022 (-€50.1 million).Cash flowIn 2023 operating cash flow was €60.3 million  compared to €31.1 million in 2022. This improvement was the direct result of the rebound in adjusted EBITDA.Restated for non-monetary items  the change in working capital was +€26.2 million  compared to a decrease of -€27.1 million in 2022. Beyond the natural rise in working capital due to increased revenue  this was mainly due to the timing of customer advances and when they were received and consumed. We received advances from several customers at the end of 2022 to support the launch of new contracts  notably in the fiber deployment segment. These advances were gradually consumed throughout 2023 as these contracts ramped up. However  similar advances from contracts negotiated with German customers were only received in early 2024. It is important to note that  depending on their form  these advances were recorded as an increase in “trade and other payables” or as a decrease in “trade receivables and related accounts.” Finally  changes in working capital during 2023 were influenced by a slight increase in contract assets linked to the ramp-up of fiber deployment activities in the Benelux  which are contractually billed less frequently than connection activities.As a result of the above  cash flow from operating activities in 2023 was €34.1 million  compared to €58.2 million in 2022.Net investments amounted to €20.9 million  or 2.0% of revenue  compared with 2.3% a year earlier. This is within the group’s target range of around 2% and goes mostly to investing in IT infrastructure and technical equipment. The group relies mainly on a proprietary IT platform  a strategic resource for managing operations that accounts for most of these investments.The Group generated a free cash flow of €13.4 million  down nearly €24 million from 2022  although there was a sharp increase in the second half of 2023 (positive cash flow of €45.8 million) compared to the first half of the year (negative cash flow of -€32.4 million).After including rent paid (-€30.4 million)  exceptionally high annual earnouts paid on past acquisitions (-€18.5 million)  acquisitions for the year (-€2.3 million)  interest paid (-€5.1 million)  and other items (-€5.4 million)  the change in the net cash position was -€48.3 million.Financial positionAt December 31  2023  the group’s equity amounted to €124.6 million  compared to €145.3 million on December 31  2022.Group gross cash amounted to €118.2 million  compared to €124.4 million at the end of December 2022  while gross bank debt was €112.6 million  compared to €70.4 million the year before. The group had €5.7 million in cash net of debt at the end of December 2023  compared to €54.0 million at the end of December 2022.Including €76.4 million in lease liabilities (IFRS 16) and €7.7 million in potential financial debt on future put options and earnouts  the group has total net debt of €78.4 million  compared to €38.9 million a year earlier. The group maintains a very solid financial structure  with a net debt/EBITDA ratio of 1.05 and a net debt-to-equity ratio of 62.9%.Outstanding receivables under the group’s non-recourse factoring program amounted to €109 million on December 31  2023  compared to €77 million at the end of 2022. The increase in mobilized receivables reflects the implementation of new factoring programs for the ramp-ups of new contracts. Factoring can finance working capital from recurring activities that have fully developed  at a very modest cost. This program  combined with a solid financial position  provides Solutions30 with the resources it needs to finance its growth strategy.Corporate social responsibilityIn 2023  the group continued to implement its CSR policy  based on the Sustainable Development Goals  and met or exceeded the main quantifiable targets it had set as described below.Environment: Group CO2 emissions (scope 1 and 2) only increased by 4.9% in 2023  11.9 percentage points less than revenue growth  compared to a group target of an increase under 2 percentage points. Roughly 90% of group emissions (scope 1 and 2) came from the fleet of work vehicles  with the transition to hybrid and electric vehicles pushed back by delivery delays and a lack of electric charging stations where technicians live. The group has also committed to setting 2030 goals  in line with the Paris Agreement. These goals should be validated by the SBTi by the end of 2024.Social: The group is making deliberate efforts to recruit and train young people. In 2023  people under the age of 30 accounted for 37.1% of recruitments  in line with the group target of over 35%. There were 27.2 hours of annual training per employee offered in 2023 (compared to 25.1 in 2022)  in line with the target of above 23 hours. Finally  women now occupy 25.9% of management positions  compared to 22.3% in 2022  an increase of 16% that is in line with the target of at least 10%. For workplace safety  the workplace accident severity rate fell by 8.5% in 2023 compared to 2022.Governance: The group restructured its Executive Committee  refocusing it on support functions (legal  finance  CSR  communication) and establishing gender parity. The purpose of the Executive Committee is to provide the support business units need to meet their operational goals.The Supervisory Board is also made up of 7 members  all of whom are independent.OutlookIn 2024  Solutions30 anticipates:Revenue growth to continue: In France  businesses related to the energy transition should make progress  while in the more mature Connectivity business  the group will continue to focus on margins over volume. The Benelux should grow somewhat compared to the high revenue levels seen in 2023  while elections in Belgium in the second half of the year may temporarily slow down fiber deployments. In other countries  growth will be driven by the ramp-up of business in Germany  thanks to major fiber contracts signed in 2023.Further improvements in margins: To meet this goal  the group will optimize both direct and fixed costs through targeted actions in every country. In France and the Benelux  the group is consolidating its processes to boost productivity and is continuing to diversify its activities. In the fast-growing markets of Germany  Poland  and the United Kingdom  achieving critical mass is a priority  building on the core of the Solutions30 model namely developing technicians’ skill sets  automating processes  and keeping central costs under control. In Italy and Spain  the group is refocusing on its most profitable contracts  while maintaining a flexible cost structure.Solutions30’s funding strategy is based on self-financing and prudent debt management  ensuring financial flexibility and independence.As it enters a new phase of profitable growth  the group is confident in its capacity to eventually reach its target of a double-digit adjusted EBITDA margin and to seize the many opportunities presented by the digital transformation and the energy transition.Webcast for investors and analystsDate: Wednesday  April 3  20246:30 pm CET / 5:30 pm GMTParticipants:Gianbeppi Fortis  Chief Executive OfficerJonathan Crauwels  Chief Financial OfficerAmaury Boilot  Group General SecretaryDial-in details:Webcast in French: https://channel.royalcast.com/landingpage/solutions30-fr/20240403_1/Webcast in English: https://channel.royalcast.com/landingpage/solutions30-en/20240403_1/Upcoming event________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________2024 Q1 Revenue Report May 13  2024 (after market close)About Solutions30 SE________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________Solutions30 provides consumers and businesses with access to the key technological advancements that are shaping our everyday lives  especially those driving the digital transformation and energy transition.

The platform consists of an end-to-end xCellit® workflow management and monitoring software system  a decentralized  functionally closed  automated manufacturing platform for cell therapies (using Lonza’s Cocoon®) and a proprietary quality control testing and release strategy.About the ATALANTA-1 study (EudraCT 2021-003272-13)ATALANTA-1 is an ongoing Phase 1/2  open-label  multicenter study to evaluate the safety  efficacy and feasibility of point-of-care manufactured GLPG5101  a CD19 CAR-T product candidate  in patients with relapsed/refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma (rrNHL). GLPG5101 is a second generation anti-CD19/4-1BB CAR-T product candidate  administered as a single fixed intravenous dose. The primary objective of the Phase 1 part of the study is to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy to determine the recommended dose for the Phase 2 part of the study. Secondary objectives include assessment of efficacy and feasibility of near the point-of-care manufacturing of GLPG5101. The dose levels that were evaluated in Phase 1 are 50x106 (DL1) and 110x106 (DL2) and 250x106 (DL3) CAR+ viable T cells. The primary objective of the Phase 2 part of the study is to evaluate the Objective Response Rate (ORR)  while the secondary objectives include Complete Response (CR)  duration of response  progression free survival  overall survival  safety  pharmacokinetic profile  and the feasibility of point-of-care manufacturing. Each enrolled patient will be followed for 24 months.About the EUPLAGIA-1 study (EudraCT 2021-003815-25)EUPLAGIA-1 is an ongoing Phase 1/2 open-label  multi-center study evaluating the safety  efficacy and feasibility of point-of-care manufactured GLPG5201  a CD19 CAR-T product candidate  in patients with relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia (rrCLL) and small cell lymphocytic lymphoma (rrSLL)  with or without Richter transformation (RT). GLPG5201 is a second generation anti-CD19/4-1BB CAR-T product candidate  administered as a single fixed intravenous dose. Patients with CD19+ rrCLL or rrSLL with ≥2 lines of prior therapy are eligible to participate  and patients with RT are eligible regardless of prior therapy. The primary objective of the Phase 1 part of the study is to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy to determine the recommended dose for the Phase 2 part of the study. The dose levels that were evaluated in the Phase 1 part of the study are 35x106 (DL1) and 100x106 (DL2) CAR+ viable T cells. The primary objective of the Phase 2 part of the study is to assess the Objective Response Rate (ORR) and the secondary objectives include the analysis of the Complete Response (CR)  duration of response  progression free survival  overall survival  safety  pharmacokinetic profile  and feasibility of point-of-care manufacturing.About GalapagosWe are a biotechnology company with operations in Europe and the US dedicated to developing transformational medicines for more years of life and quality of life.
