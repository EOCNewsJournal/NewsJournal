Of that amount  €196.6 billion ($211 billion) is being held by the Belgium-based clearinghouse Euroclear  which last year accumulated nearly €4.4 billion in interest on the funds.“Decisions related to the seizing of assets are for the relevant country authorities and jurisdictions to decide ” Kozack told reporters  reiterating the IMF’s previous statements on the matter.“What is important for the IMF is that any action has sufficient legal underpinnings and does not undermine the functioning of the international monetary system ” the spokeswoman stressed.The IMF has previously cautioned that Western plans to seize frozen Russian assets could pose a threat to the global monetary system and entail unforeseen risks.Some Western officials have been pushing for the outright seizure of the Russian funds and transferring them to Ukraine  or at least using the interest generated by the assets.While Kiev’s Western backers generally agree that the frozen assets should be used to aid Ukraine  they are at odds about whether an outright seizure would be legal. The US and UK support the direct expropriation of the funds  but some EU member states  France and Germany in particular  warn the move would erode trust in the European financial system.The EU’s foreign policy chief  Josep Borrell  proposed last month using the profits generated by Russia’s frozen central bank reserves to support Ukraine militarily.The bloc would reportedly use 90% of the revenues to procure arms for Ukraine  while the remaining 10% would be transferred to the EU budget to be used to support Kiev’s defense industry.Moscow reacted to the diplomat’s proposal by warning that such a move would lead to disastrous consequences. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that Borrell’s plan is “another statement in the spirit of moving towards the destruction of the legal foundations of European and international law” and cautioned that such a seizure would cast serious doubt on the EU’s commitment to the principle of asset immunity.The spokesman also warned that all EU nations and officials that back Borrell’s plan would be subject to “legal prosecution for many decades to come.”Russia has repeatedly said that any actions taken against its assets would amount to “theft ” stressing that seizing the funds or any similar move would violate international law and undermine Western currencies  the global financial system  and the world economy.,neutral,0.03,0.64,0.32,negative,0.02,0.2,0.78,True,English,"['Russian assets', 'IMF', 'possibility', 'Belgium-based clearinghouse Euroclear', 'relevant country authorities', 'global monetary system', 'foreign policy chief', 'global financial system', 'Russian central bank', 'sufficient legal support', 'sufficient legal underpinnings', 'other G7 nations', 'central bank reserves', 'international monetary system', 'EU member states', 'European financial system', 'frozen Russian assets', 'frozen reserves', 'legal foundations', 'legal prosecution', 'EU nations', 'international law', 'regular briefing', 'The EU', 'previous statements', 'Western plans', 'unforeseen risks', 'Western backers', 'The US', 'direct expropriation', 'EU budget', 'defense industry', 'disastrous consequences', 'Dmitry Peskov', 'serious doubt', 'asset immunity', 'many decades', 'Western currencies', 'world economy', 'Russian funds', 'frozen assets', 'outright seizure', 'Julie Kozack', 'The IMF', 'Western officials', 'Kremlin spokesman', 'Josep Borrell', 'similar move', 'Ukraine conflict', 'IMF spokesperson', 'decisions', 'steps', 'Thursday', 'start', 'amount', 'interest', 'seizing', 'jurisdictions', 'reporters', 'matter', 'action', 'functioning', 'spokeswoman', 'threat', 'Kiev', 'odds', 'France', 'Germany', 'trust', 'profits', 'bloc', 'revenues', 'arms', 'Moscow', 'diplomat', 'proposal', 'spirit', 'destruction', 'commitment', 'principle']",2024-04-04,2024-04-05,rt.com

This proposal is divided into five items:A. Terms of LTIP 2024B. Issue of warrantsC. Transfer of shares and/or warrantsD. If item C is not approved  the Board proposes that hedging of LTIP 2024 shall take place via an equity swap agreement with a third partyE. Other matters related to LTIP 2024A. Terms of LTIP 2024A.1 IntroductionThe Board wishes to establish a long-term incentive program for certain key employees in order to encourage personal long-term ownership in the Company as well as to increase and enhance its ability to recruit  retain and motivate employees. The Board therefore proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to implement a long-term performance share program 2024 (""LTIP 2024""). The intention is also to use LTIP 2024 to unite the interest of the employees with the interests of shareholders.Participants may  after a qualifying period  receive allotments of Vitrolife ordinary shares without consideration. Allotment of shares  and the number of shares that will be allotted  will depend on the fulfilment of a predetermined performance target. The term of LTIP 2024 is more than three years.A.2 Basic features of LTIP 2024The LTIP 2024 will be directed towards certain key employees in the Vitrolife Group. The participants are based in Sweden and other countries where the Vitrolife Group is active. Each participant may be entitled  after a certain qualification period (defined below)  provided continued employment during the entire period (except from ""Good Leavers"")  and depending on the fulfilment of a predetermined performance target linked to Vitrolife's total share return (TSR)  to receive allotment of Vitrolife shares (""Performance Shares""). The participants shall not pay any consideration for the allotted Performance Shares.A.3 Participation in LTIP 2024LTIP 2024 is directed towards a maximum of 40 employees  divided into three categories of participants as follows:Categories Maximum number of shares 1. CEO 60 000 2. Other members of the executive management team (maximum 9 persons) 35 000 (per person) 3. Other key employees (maximum 30 persons) 20 000 (per person) Total maximum number of shares 400 000Any resolution on participation or implementation of LTIP 2024 shall be conditional on that it  in the Board's judgement  can be offered with reasonable administrative costs and financial effects.A.4 Allotment of Performance SharesAllotment of Performance Shares within LTIP 2024 will be made during a limited period of time following the Annual General Meeting 2027. The period up to this date is referred to as the qualification period (vesting period). A condition for the participant to receive allotment of Performance Shares is that the participant remains an employee of the Vitrolife Group during the full qualification period up until allotment. Allotment of Performance Shares also requires that a minimum TSR performance target is fulfilled. The Board shall establish a customary definition of Good Leavers and determine whether any allocation shall be made to participants who are considered Good Leavers.The performance target is based on the Company's total share return (""TSR"") during the term of LTIP 2024. TSR is to be calculated based on the volume-weighted average price of the Company's share on Nasdaq Stockholm during the ten (10) business days that follows immediately after the Annual General Meeting 2024  compared with the volume-weighted average price of the Company's share on Nasdaq Stockholm during the last ten (10) business days of the three-year period following the Annual General Meeting 2024. Performance Shares will be allotted if the average annual TSR is at least 7.5 percent (the minimum level). 0 percent of the Performance Shares will vest below the minimum level. 50 percent of the Performance Shares will vest at the minimum level and 100 percent of the Performance Shares will vest at or above the maximum performance level which is 12.5 percent. Vesting and allotment will be calculated linearly between the minimum and the maximum level. The outcome will be communicated to the shareholders after the allotment of Performance Shares to the participants.Prior to the allotment of Performance Shares  the Board shall assess whether the allotment is reasonable in relation to the Company's financial results  position and performance  as well as other factors.If significant changes take place within the Vitrolife Group  or on the market  which  by the assessment of the Board  would mean that the terms for allocation/transfer of shares according to LTIP 2024 is no longer reasonable  the Board shall have the right to implement an adjustment to LTIP 2024  including  among others  the right to reduce the number of Performance Shares allocated/transferred  or not to allocate/transfer Performance Shares at all.A.5 Implementation and administration etc.The Board  with the assistance of the remuneration committee  shall in accordance with the resolutions by the Annual General Meeting set forth herein be responsible for the detailed design and implementation of LTIP 2024. The Board may also decide on the implementation of an alternative cash based incentive for participants in countries where the allotment of Performance Shares is not appropriate  as well as if otherwise considered appropriate. Such alternative incentive program shall to the extent practically possible be designed to correspond to the terms of LTIP 2024.The intention is that the Board shall launch LTIP 2024 as soon as practically possible after the Annual General Meeting.B. Issue of warrantsIn order to enable delivery of shares under the LTIP 2024 as well as to hedge the financial exposure that the LTIP 2024 is expected to entail  the Board proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to issue a maximum number of 480 000 warrants of series 2024/2027  without consideration  to a wholly owned subsidiary of Vitrolife AB (publ) (the ""Subsidiary"").Each warrant of series 2024/2027 entitles the holder to subscription for one (1) share in Vitrolife AB (publ) during the period from 6 May 2024   or the later date on which the warrants are registered  up to and including 1 July 2027 . Subscription for new shares by way of exercising warrants of series 2024/2027 shall be made at a price per share of SEK 0.204   which corresponds to the quota value of the shares. The exercise price and the number of shares that each warrant of series 2024/2027 entitles may be subject to recalculation in the event of a bonus issue  share split  rights issue  etc.  wherein the recalculation terms in the complete terms and conditions of the warrants shall be applied. The subscription of warrants of series 2024/2027 shall be made no later than on 10 May 2024 . However  the Board shall be entitled to extend the subscription period. There can be no over-subscription. For complete terms  see Appendix 1 and Appendix A1.If the warrants of series 2024/2027 are exercised in full  the share capital will increase by SEK 97 920 .C. Approval of transfer of shares and/or warrants and hedging activitiesC.1 Number of shares and/or warrantsThe Board proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to approve that the Subsidiary may transfer a maximum of 400 000 shares and/or warrants to the participants in the LTIP 2024 in connection with allotment of Performance Shares in accordance with the terms set out in section A  as well as dispose of an additional number of maximum 80 000 warrants through transfer of maximum 80 000 warrants to a third party  as a hedging activity in relation to the Company's costs for social security contributions.C.2 Other conditions for transfer of shares and/or warrants to participants in LTIP 2024Share transfers to participants in LTIP 2024 shall be made without the participants paying consideration and shall be carried out at the time and subject to the other conditions under which participants in LTIP 2024 have the right to be allotted Performance Shares.C.3 RecalculationThe number of shares and/or warrants that might be transferred under LTIP 2024 in accordance with sections C.1 and C.2 above shall be subject to customary re-calculation principles and may  consequently  be subject to re-calculation due to a bonus issue  share split  preferential rights issue  dividends and/or other similar events. Resolutions resolved upon by the Annual General Meeting 2024 shall not be included in a re-calculation of the number of shares.D. Hedge of LTIP 2024 via an equity swap agreement with a third partyIt is the Board's assessment that an issue of warrants to the Subsidiary and transfer of shares and/or warrants from the Subsidiary to the participants in the LTIP 2024 is the most cost-effective method of transferring shares in Vitrolife under the LTIP 2024. The board therefore proposes that the delivery of shares to the participants is secured by item C above. Should the necessary majority not be obtained for the proposal in item C  the Board proposes that a share swap agreement with a third party is entered into in accordance with this item D.The Board proposes that the Annual General Meeting  should the necessary majority not be obtained for item C above  resolves to secure deliver of shares to the participants in the LTIP 2024  and to hedge the expected financial exposure of LTIP 2024  by the Company entering into a share swap agreement with a third party  whereby the third party in its own name shall acquire and transfer shares in the Company under LTIP 2024. The relevant number of shares shall correspond to the number of shares proposed under item C above.E. Other matters in relation to LTIP 2024E.1 Majority requirements etc.The resolution by the Annual General Meeting regarding the implementation of LTIP 2024 according to item A above is conditional on the Annual General Meeting resolving either in accordance with the Board's proposal under item B or C above or in accordance with the Board's proposal under item D above.The resolution according to item A  B and D above shall require a majority of more than half of the votes cast at the Annual General Meeting. A valid resolution under item C above requires that shareholders representing not less than nine-tenths of the votes cast as well as the shares represented at the Annual General Meeting approve of the resolution.E.2 The value  estimated costs  expenses and financial effects of LTIP 2024The participants' rights to receive Performance Shares under LTIP 2024 are not securities and cannot be pledged or transferred. Neither are any shareholders' rights transferred to participants in the program prior to the day when they receive their Performance Shares and become the owners of the shares. An estimated market value of the conditional rights to receive Performance Shares can however be calculated. Based on a preliminary valuation in accordance with a Monte Carlo valuation model  the total value of the conditional rights to receive Performance Shares under LTIP 2024 has been calculated to approximately MSEK 43.072  under the following assumptions: a share price at the time of implementation of SEK 200   a market-based risk-free interest of 2.53 percent  a volatility of 40 percent and an annual employee turnover of 0 percent.LTIP 2024 will be accounted for in accordance with ""IFRS 2 - Share-based payments"". IFRS 2 stipulates that the share awards should be expensed as personnel costs over the qualification period and will be accounted for directly against equity. Personnel costs in accordance with IFRS 2 do not affect the company's cash flow. Social security contributions will be recognized as an expense in the income statement through regular provisions in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The amount of these regular provisions will be revalued in line with the trend in the value of the right to Performance Shares  and the social security contributions that may be payable on the allotment of Performance Shares.Assuming a share price at the time of implementation of SEK 200 and costs for pension provisions to Swedish participants amounting to 35 percent  the personnel costs for LTIP 2024 is estimated to approximately MSEK 48.1 at grant of the Performance Shares  corresponding to an estimated annual cost of approximately MSEK 16.0.Assuming that the minimum performance target is achieved so that the 50 percent of the Performance Shares vest  a TSR increase of 7.5 percent during the qualification period  costs for weighted social security contributions amounting to 20 percent of the benefit value at the end of the qualification period and an annual employee turnover of 0 percent  the total cost for LTIP 2024 (including the personnel costs) is estimated to approximately MSEK 58.0 before tax  corresponding to an estimated annual cost of approximately MSEK 19.33 before tax.Assuming that the maximum performance level is reached so that the 100 percent of the Performance Shares vest  a TSR increase of 12.5 percent during the qualification period  costs for weighted social security contributions amounting to 20 percent of the benefit value at the end of the qualification period and an annual employee turnover of 0 percent  the total cost for LTIP 2024 (including the personnel costs) is estimated to approximately MSEK 70.9 before tax  corresponding to an estimated annual cost of approximately MSEK 23.63 before tax.The above calculations are based on a decision on hedging in accordance with item C. In the event that the Annual General Meeting decides on hedging measures regarding LTIP 2024 in accordance with the proposal under item D  costs of approximately MSEK 0.5 - MSEK 1 will be added regarding share swap agreements with third parties.In the view of the Board  the positive effects expected to arise from LTIP 2024  outweigh the costs associated with LTIP 2024.E.3 Dilution and effects on key performance ratiosThe Board's proposal to resolve on issuance of warrants in accordance with item C above entails a dilution effect corresponding to a maximum of approximately 0.35 per cent of the shares and votes in the Company if the proposed warrants are exercised in full. The dilution effect is calculated as the relation between the additional shares that the warrants will be exercised for and the sum of the current number of shares and the additional shares that the warrants will be exercised for.The costs of the LTIP 2024 are expected to have only marginal effects on the company's key performance ratios.E.4 The Board's explanatory statementAn individual long-term ownership commitment among the participants in LTIP 2024 is expected to stimulate greater interest and motivation in the Company's business operations  results and strategy. Moreover  the Board wishes to increase the ability of the Company to retain important executives and other key employees. The Board believes that the implementation of LTIP 2024 will benefit the Company and its shareholders. LTIP 2024 will provide a competitive and motivation-improving incentive for executives and other key employees within the Vitrolife Group.LTIP 2024 has been designed to reward the participants for increased shareholder value by allotting shares  based on the fulfilment of a performance condition. By linking the employees' remuneration to the development of the Company's results and value  the long-term value growth of the Company is rewarded. Based on these circumstances  the Board considers that the implementation of LTIP 2024 will have a positive effect on the Vitrolife Group's continued development  and will therefore be beneficial to the shareholders and the Company.E.5 Other share-related incentive programsThe Company has three outstanding share-related incentive programs in accordance with resolutions of previous Annual General Meetings: Long-Term Incentive Program 2021 (""LTIP 2021"")  Long-Term Incentive Program 2022 (""LTIP 2022"") and Long-Term Incentive Program 2023 (""LTIP 2023"") which were decided by the 2021  2022 and 2023 Annual General Meetings  which are based on performance shares.The Company's share-related incentive programs are described on pages 72 - 74 in the Company's annual report and also appears in the Board's remuneration report.E.6 Adjustment AuthorizationThe Board  or a person appointed by the Board  shall be authorized to make minor adjustments to the above resolutions that may be necessary in connection with the registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and Euroclear Sweden AB respectively.E.7 Preparation of the itemThe basis for LTIP 2024 has been prepared by the Board of the Company. The work has been supported by external advisors and has been made in consultation with shareholders. The Board has thereafter decided to present this proposal for the Annual General Meeting. Except for the staff that have prepared the matter upon instruction from the Board  no employee that may be a participant of LTIP 2024 has participated in the preparations of the program's terms.Other disclosuresThe accounts and the auditor's report  the statement according to item 8 b ) and the complete proposals in accordance with items 9 b ) and 14-19 will be available at the premises of the Company  Gustaf Werners gata 2  Västra Frölunda  Sweden   and on the Company website www.vitrolifegroup.com at the latest three weeks before the AGM.

This proposal is divided into five items:A. Terms of LTIP 2024B. Issue of warrantsC. Transfer of shares and/or warrantsD. If item C is not approved  the Board proposes that hedging of LTIP 2024 shall take place via an equity swap agreement with a third partyE. Other matters related to LTIP 2024A. Terms of LTIP 2024A.1 IntroductionThe Board wishes to establish a long-term incentive program for certain key employees in order to encourage personal long-term ownership in the Company as well as to increase and enhance its ability to recruit  retain and motivate employees. The Board therefore proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to implement a long-term performance share program 2024 (""LTIP 2024""). The intention is also to use LTIP 2024 to unite the interest of the employees with the interests of shareholders.Participants may  after a qualifying period  receive allotments of Vitrolife ordinary shares without consideration. Allotment of shares  and the number of shares that will be allotted  will depend on the fulfilment of a predetermined performance target. The term of LTIP 2024 is more than three years.A.2 Basic features of LTIP 2024The LTIP 2024 will be directed towards certain key employees in the Vitrolife Group. The participants are based in Sweden and other countries where the Vitrolife Group is active. Each participant may be entitled  after a certain qualification period (defined below)  provided continued employment during the entire period (except from ""Good Leavers"")  and depending on the fulfilment of a predetermined performance target linked to Vitrolife's total share return (TSR)  to receive allotment of Vitrolife shares (""Performance Shares""). The participants shall not pay any consideration for the allotted Performance Shares.A.3 Participation in LTIP 2024LTIP 2024 is directed towards a maximum of 40 employees  divided into three categories of participants as follows:Categories Maximum number of shares 1. CEO 60 000 2. Other members of the executive management team (maximum 9 persons) 35 000 (per person) 3. Other key employees (maximum 30 persons) 20 000 (per person) Total maximum number of shares 400 000Any resolution on participation or implementation of LTIP 2024 shall be conditional on that it  in the Board's judgement  can be offered with reasonable administrative costs and financial effects.A.4 Allotment of Performance SharesAllotment of Performance Shares within LTIP 2024 will be made during a limited period of time following the Annual General Meeting 2027. The period up to this date is referred to as the qualification period (vesting period). A condition for the participant to receive allotment of Performance Shares is that the participant remains an employee of the Vitrolife Group during the full qualification period up until allotment. Allotment of Performance Shares also requires that a minimum TSR performance target is fulfilled. The Board shall establish a customary definition of Good Leavers and determine whether any allocation shall be made to participants who are considered Good Leavers.The performance target is based on the Company's total share return (""TSR"") during the term of LTIP 2024. TSR is to be calculated based on the volume-weighted average price of the Company's share on Nasdaq Stockholm during the ten (10) business days that follows immediately after the Annual General Meeting 2024  compared with the volume-weighted average price of the Company's share on Nasdaq Stockholm during the last ten (10) business days of the three-year period following the Annual General Meeting 2024. Performance Shares will be allotted if the average annual TSR is at least 7.5 percent (the minimum level). 0 percent of the Performance Shares will vest below the minimum level. 50 percent of the Performance Shares will vest at the minimum level and 100 percent of the Performance Shares will vest at or above the maximum performance level which is 12.5 percent. Vesting and allotment will be calculated linearly between the minimum and the maximum level. The outcome will be communicated to the shareholders after the allotment of Performance Shares to the participants.Prior to the allotment of Performance Shares  the Board shall assess whether the allotment is reasonable in relation to the Company's financial results  position and performance  as well as other factors.If significant changes take place within the Vitrolife Group  or on the market  which  by the assessment of the Board  would mean that the terms for allocation/transfer of shares according to LTIP 2024 is no longer reasonable  the Board shall have the right to implement an adjustment to LTIP 2024  including  among others  the right to reduce the number of Performance Shares allocated/transferred  or not to allocate/transfer Performance Shares at all.A.5 Implementation and administration etc.The Board  with the assistance of the remuneration committee  shall in accordance with the resolutions by the Annual General Meeting set forth herein be responsible for the detailed design and implementation of LTIP 2024. The Board may also decide on the implementation of an alternative cash based incentive for participants in countries where the allotment of Performance Shares is not appropriate  as well as if otherwise considered appropriate. Such alternative incentive program shall to the extent practically possible be designed to correspond to the terms of LTIP 2024.The intention is that the Board shall launch LTIP 2024 as soon as practically possible after the Annual General Meeting.B. Issue of warrantsIn order to enable delivery of shares under the LTIP 2024 as well as to hedge the financial exposure that the LTIP 2024 is expected to entail  the Board proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to issue a maximum number of 480 000 warrants of series 2024/2027  without consideration  to a wholly owned subsidiary of Vitrolife AB (publ) (the ""Subsidiary"").Each warrant of series 2024/2027 entitles the holder to subscription for one (1) share in Vitrolife AB (publ) during the period from 6 May 2024  or the later date on which the warrants are registered  up to and including 1 July 2027. Subscription for new shares by way of exercising warrants of series 2024/2027 shall be made at a price per share of SEK 0.204  which corresponds to the quota value of the shares. The exercise price and the number of shares that each warrant of series 2024/2027 entitles may be subject to recalculation in the event of a bonus issue  share split  rights issue  etc.  wherein the recalculation terms in the complete terms and conditions of the warrants shall be applied. The subscription of warrants of series 2024/2027 shall be made no later than on 10 May 2024. However  the Board shall be entitled to extend the subscription period. There can be no over-subscription. For complete terms  see Appendix 1 and Appendix A1.If the warrants of series 2024/2027 are exercised in full  the share capital will increase by SEK 97 920.C. Approval of transfer of shares and/or warrants and hedging activitiesC.1 Number of shares and/or warrantsThe Board proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to approve that the Subsidiary may transfer a maximum of 400 000 shares and/or warrants to the participants in the LTIP 2024 in connection with allotment of Performance Shares in accordance with the terms set out in section A  as well as dispose of an additional number of maximum 80 000 warrants through transfer of maximum 80 000 warrants to a third party  as a hedging activity in relation to the Company's costs for social security contributions.C.2 Other conditions for transfer of shares and/or warrants to participants in LTIP 2024Share transfers to participants in LTIP 2024 shall be made without the participants paying consideration and shall be carried out at the time and subject to the other conditions under which participants in LTIP 2024 have the right to be allotted Performance Shares.C.3 RecalculationThe number of shares and/or warrants that might be transferred under LTIP 2024 in accordance with sections C.1 and C.2 above shall be subject to customary re-calculation principles and may  consequently  be subject to re-calculation due to a bonus issue  share split  preferential rights issue  dividends and/or other similar events. Resolutions resolved upon by the Annual General Meeting 2024 shall not be included in a re-calculation of the number of shares.D. Hedge of LTIP 2024 via an equity swap agreement with a third partyIt is the Board's assessment that an issue of warrants to the Subsidiary and transfer of shares and/or warrants from the Subsidiary to the participants in the LTIP 2024 is the most cost-effective method of transferring shares in Vitrolife under the LTIP 2024. The board therefore proposes that the delivery of shares to the participants is secured by item C above. Should the necessary majority not be obtained for the proposal in item C  the Board proposes that a share swap agreement with a third party is entered into in accordance with this item D.The Board proposes that the Annual General Meeting  should the necessary majority not be obtained for item C above  resolves to secure deliver of shares to the participants in the LTIP 2024  and to hedge the expected financial exposure of LTIP 2024  by the Company entering into a share swap agreement with a third party  whereby the third party in its own name shall acquire and transfer shares in the Company under LTIP 2024. The relevant number of shares shall correspond to the number of shares proposed under item C above.E. Other matters in relation to LTIP 2024E.1 Majority requirements etc.The resolution by the Annual General Meeting regarding the implementation of LTIP 2024 according to item A above is conditional on the Annual General Meeting resolving either in accordance with the Board's proposal under item B or C above or in accordance with the Board's proposal under item D above.The resolution according to item A  B and D above shall require a majority of more than half of the votes cast at the Annual General Meeting. A valid resolution under item C above requires that shareholders representing not less than nine-tenths of the votes cast as well as the shares represented at the Annual General Meeting approve of the resolution.E.2 The value  estimated costs  expenses and financial effects of LTIP 2024The participants' rights to receive Performance Shares under LTIP 2024 are not securities and cannot be pledged or transferred. Neither are any shareholders' rights transferred to participants in the program prior to the day when they receive their Performance Shares and become the owners of the shares. An estimated market value of the conditional rights to receive Performance Shares can however be calculated. Based on a preliminary valuation in accordance with a Monte Carlo valuation model  the total value of the conditional rights to receive Performance Shares under LTIP 2024 has been calculated to approximately MSEK 43.072  under the following assumptions: a share price at the time of implementation of SEK 200  a market-based risk-free interest of 2.53 percent  a volatility of 40 percent and an annual employee turnover of 0 percent.LTIP 2024 will be accounted for in accordance with ""IFRS 2 - Share-based payments"". IFRS 2 stipulates that the share awards should be expensed as personnel costs over the qualification period and will be accounted for directly against equity. Personnel costs in accordance with IFRS 2 do not affect the company's cash flow. Social security contributions will be recognized as an expense in the income statement through regular provisions in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The amount of these regular provisions will be revalued in line with the trend in the value of the right to Performance Shares  and the social security contributions that may be payable on the allotment of Performance Shares.Assuming a share price at the time of implementation of SEK 200 and costs for pension provisions to Swedish participants amounting to 35 percent  the personnel costs for LTIP 2024 is estimated to approximately MSEK 48.1 at grant of the Performance Shares  corresponding to an estimated annual cost of approximately MSEK 16.0.Assuming that the minimum performance target is achieved so that the 50 percent of the Performance Shares vest  a TSR increase of 7.5 percent during the qualification period  costs for weighted social security contributions amounting to 20 percent of the benefit value at the end of the qualification period and an annual employee turnover of 0 percent  the total cost for LTIP 2024 (including the personnel costs) is estimated to approximately MSEK 58.0 before tax  corresponding to an estimated annual cost of approximately MSEK 19.33 before tax.Assuming that the maximum performance level is reached so that the 100 percent of the Performance Shares vest  a TSR increase of 12.5 percent during the qualification period  costs for weighted social security contributions amounting to 20 percent of the benefit value at the end of the qualification period and an annual employee turnover of 0 percent  the total cost for LTIP 2024 (including the personnel costs) is estimated to approximately MSEK 70.9 before tax  corresponding to an estimated annual cost of approximately MSEK 23.63 before tax.The above calculations are based on a decision on hedging in accordance with item C. In the event that the Annual General Meeting decides on hedging measures regarding LTIP 2024 in accordance with the proposal under item D  costs of approximately MSEK 0.5 - MSEK 1 will be added regarding share swap agreements with third parties.In the view of the Board  the positive effects expected to arise from LTIP 2024  outweigh the costs associated with LTIP 2024.E.3 Dilution and effects on key performance ratiosThe Board's proposal to resolve on issuance of warrants in accordance with item C above entails a dilution effect corresponding to a maximum of approximately 0.35 per cent of the shares and votes in the Company if the proposed warrants are exercised in full. The dilution effect is calculated as the relation between the additional shares that the warrants will be exercised for and the sum of the current number of shares and the additional shares that the warrants will be exercised for.The costs of the LTIP 2024 are expected to have only marginal effects on the company's key performance ratios.E.4 The Board's explanatory statementAn individual long-term ownership commitment among the participants in LTIP 2024 is expected to stimulate greater interest and motivation in the Company's business operations  results and strategy. Moreover  the Board wishes to increase the ability of the Company to retain important executives and other key employees. The Board believes that the implementation of LTIP 2024 will benefit the Company and its shareholders. LTIP 2024 will provide a competitive and motivation-improving incentive for executives and other key employees within the Vitrolife Group.LTIP 2024 has been designed to reward the participants for increased shareholder value by allotting shares  based on the fulfilment of a performance condition. By linking the employees' remuneration to the development of the Company's results and value  the long-term value growth of the Company is rewarded. Based on these circumstances  the Board considers that the implementation of LTIP 2024 will have a positive effect on the Vitrolife Group's continued development  and will therefore be beneficial to the shareholders and the Company.E.5 Other share-related incentive programsThe Company has three outstanding share-related incentive programs in accordance with resolutions of previous Annual General Meetings: Long-Term Incentive Program 2021 (""LTIP 2021"")  Long-Term Incentive Program 2022 (""LTIP 2022"") and Long-Term Incentive Program 2023 (""LTIP 2023"") which were decided by the 2021  2022 and 2023 Annual General Meetings  which are based on performance shares.The Company's share-related incentive programs are described on pages 72 - 74 in the Company's annual report and also appears in the Board's remuneration report.E.6 Adjustment AuthorizationThe Board  or a person appointed by the Board  shall be authorized to make minor adjustments to the above resolutions that may be necessary in connection with the registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and Euroclear Sweden AB respectively.E.7 Preparation of the itemThe basis for LTIP 2024 has been prepared by the Board of the Company. The work has been supported by external advisors and has been made in consultation with shareholders. The Board has thereafter decided to present this proposal for the Annual General Meeting.

The Board of Directors shall prepare a proposal for new guidelines at least every fourth year and present it to the Annual General Meeting.

As set out above  the Compensation & Benefits Committee's tasks include preparing the Board of Directors' resolutions in remuneration-related matters. This includes any resolutions to derogate from these guidelines.Description of significant changes to the guidelines and how shareholders' views have been taken into accountBased on comments and questions received from investors and in individual meetings  and based on comments expressed in proxy advisor reports  the Board of Directors has  at the recommendation of the Compensation & Benefits Committee  decided to propose the implementation of a claw-back clause strengthening the Board of Directors' possibility to in whole or in part reclaim variable pay earned or paid on incorrect grounds.Implementation of a Management Programme and an All Employee Programme in accordance with A.I and A.II  respectively  and hedging arrangements in respect thereof in accordance with B.I and B.II  respectively  and/or C (item 18)BackgroundThe Board of Directors of Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB (publ) ("" Sobi "") proposes that the Annual General Meeting 2024 resolves on the implementation of long-term incentive programmes  giving all permanent employees of the Sobi Group the opportunity of becoming shareholders in Sobi. A division into two parts is proposed: (I) one part directed to managers and executives (the "" Management Programme "") and (II) one part directed to all other employees (the "" All Employee Programme ""  jointly with the Management Programme  the "" Programmes "")  with separate resolutions on each part.The overall purpose of the Programmes is to closely align the employees' interests with those of the shareholders and to create a long-term commitment to Sobi. The Management Programme provides Sobi with a crucial component of a competitive total remuneration package with which to attract and retain executives who are critical to Sobi's long-term success. The purpose of the All Employee Programme is to create commitment and motivation for the entire permanent workforce of the Sobi Group. For these reasons the Board of Directors considers that having recurring long-term incentive programmes is a vital and important part of Sobi's total remuneration package.The Board of Directors of Sobi has evaluated the long-term incentive programmes approved by the Annual General Meeting 2023 and has concluded that the Management Programme as well as the All Employee Programme work well and satisfy the intended purposes.Similar to the incentive programmes approved by the Annual General Meeting 2023  the Programmes shall be inspiring  achievable  easy to understand  cost effective to administer  easy to communicate and in line with market practice. Following implementation of the Programmes  the Board of Directors intends to carry out an evaluation thereof in order to systematically analyse the achieved results in relation to the aims outlined above. The aim of the evaluation will be to determine whether the Programmes satisfy their purposes  and this will also include a review of the outcome and the costs for the Programmes.A. Implementation of the ProgrammesThe Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting 2024 resolves on implementation of the Programmes in accordance with the principal terms and conditions set out below:I. The Management ProgrammeIt is proposed that the Management Programme be open to no more than 350 permanent employees of the Sobi Group  whereof no more than 275 employees on director level of the Sobi Group ("" Band D "")  no more than 45 employees on vice president level of the Sobi Group ("" Band C "")  no more than 15 pre-selected key employees of the Sobi Group ("" Band B2 "")  no more than 14 employees who are members of the Executive Committee of the Sobi Group ("" Band B1 "") and the CEO of Sobi ("" CEO "")  on the following terms and conditions and the terms and conditions set out in item A.III below.Performance sharesa) Each participant in Band D  Band C  Band B2  Band B1 and the CEO will free of charge receive a performance share award under the Management Programme ("" LTIP Award "") entitling the participant to receive an allocation of a number of Sobi common shares free of charge from Sobi or from a designated third party  subject to the satisfaction of the condition in section e) below as well as the satisfaction of the performance conditions set out in section c) below ("" Management Performance Shares ""). Any Management Performance Shares will be allocated after the expiration of the three-year vesting period beginning on the date that Sobi starts inviting the employees in Band D  Band C  Band B2  Band B1 and the CEO to participate in the Management Programme (the "" Vesting Period ""). Sobi must invite the employees in Band D  Band C  Band B2  Band B1 and the CEO to participate in the Management Programme no later than on 31 December 2024 .b) The value of the underlying shares at the time of grant in respect of each LTIP Award will amount to (i) 150% of the gross annual fixed salary in 2024 for the CEO  (ii) 75% of the gross annual fixed salary in 2024 for each Band B1 participant  on an individual basis  (iii) 75% of the gross annual fixed salary in 2024 for each Band B2 participant  on an individual basis  (iv) 75% of the gross annual fixed salary in 2024 for each Band C participant  on an individual basis  and (v) 35% of the average gross annual fixed salary in 2024 for Band D participants. The share price used to calculate the value of the underlying shares in respect of each LTIP Award  and hence the number of shares to which each LTIP Award entitles  shall be the volume-weighted average price paid for the Sobi common share on Nasdaq Stockholm  adjusted for any dividend payments  during a period of ten trading days in connection with the commencement of the Vesting Period.c) The portion (if any) of an LTIP Award that will vest at the end of the Vesting Period is based on and subject to the satisfaction of the following performance conditions:Absolute TSR[4] increase60% of an LTIP Award granted to a participant will be subject to satisfaction of certain levels of absolute TSR increase over the Vesting Period. In order for any vesting related to absolute TSR increase to occur  the TSR must increase by more than 10% over the Vesting Period. In order for full vesting related to absolute TSR increase to occur  the TSR must increase by at least 40% over the Vesting Period. If the TSR increase is between 10% and 40% over the Vesting Period  a linear vesting related to absolute TSR increase will occur. The calculation of the TSR shall for the purpose of the TSR performance condition be based on a comparison of the volume-weighted average price paid for the Sobi common share on Nasdaq Stockholm  adjusted for any dividend payments  during a period of ten trading days in connection with the start of the Vesting Period and the volume-weighted average price paid for the Sobi common share on Nasdaq Stockholm  adjusted for any dividend payments  during the last ten trading days of the Vesting Period.Annual revenues40% of an LTIP Award granted to a participant will be subject to the Sobi Group's actual annual revenues reaching or exceeding the Sobi Group's target annual revenues for the Management Programme as set by the Board of Directors each year. A comparison shall be made for each of the financial years 2024  2025 and 2026. If the threshold is reached or exceeded for a financial year  full vesting related to annual revenues in respect of that financial year will occur (i.e. 1/3 of 40%). If the threshold is not reached for a financial year  no vesting related to annual revenues in respect of that financial year will occur.d) Management Performance Shares may be allocated only after the expiration of the Vesting Period  unless the Board of Directors of Sobi in an individual case resolves otherwise.e) In order for a Management Programme participant to be allocated Management Performance Shares it is a condition that  with certain specific exemptions  he/she has been permanently employed within the Sobi Group for the duration of the whole Vesting Period.f) If significant changes in the Sobi Group or in the market occur which  in the opinion of the Board of Directors  would result in a situation where the conditions for allocation of Management Performance Shares become unreasonable  the Board of Directors shall be entitled to make adjustments to the Management Programme  including  among other things  be entitled to resolve on a reduced allocation of Management Performance Shares  or that no Management Performance Shares shall be allocated at all.Employee stock optionsa) In addition to the LTIP Award  the CEO as well as Band B1 and Band B2 participants (approximately 30 employees in total) shall free of charge be awarded employee stock options ("" Options "").b) The Options shall not be deemed securities and shall be non-transferable.c) The Options shall be awarded as soon as possible after the Annual General Meeting 2024. For new employees awards may take place at a later point in time but no later than on 31 December 2024.d) Each Option shall entitle the holder to acquire one Sobi common share ("" Option Share "") at a strike price equivalent to 105% of the volume-weighted average price paid for the Sobi common share at Nasdaq Stockholm  adjusted for any dividend payments  during a period of ten trading days in connection with the commencement of the Vesting Period (the "" Strike Price ""). The Strike Price shall be rounded to the nearest SEK 0.01  whereby SEK 0.005 shall be rounded upwards. The Strike Price and the number of Option Shares that may be acquired for each Option will be subject to recalculation as a result of intervening bonus issues  splits  rights issues and/or other similar corporate events.e) The value of each award of Options will amount to (i) 150% of the gross annual fixed salary in 2024 for the CEO  (ii) 75% of the gross annual fixed salary in 2024 for each Band B1 participant  on an individual basis and (iii) 75% of the gross annual fixed salary in 2024 for for each Band B2 participant  on an individual basis. The valuation of the Options will be carried out pursuant to Black & Scholes. The aggregate number of Options awarded will not exceed 1 562 878 and amount to:CEO: no more than 266 627 Options.Band B1: no more than between 29 405 and 91 728 Options per person  depending on the size of the gross annual fixed salary in 2024.Band B2: no more than between 16 465 and 58 865 Options per person  depending on the size of the gross annual fixed salary in 2024.f) Each holder of Options shall be entitled to exercise the Options as from the third anniversary of the award date  up to and including the fifth anniversary of the award date ("" Exercise Period "")  subject to satisfaction of the condition in section h) below as well as the satisfaction of the performance condition set out in section g) below. In accordance with customary terms and conditions  it shall be possible to exercise the Options prematurely in the event of  inter alia  compulsory redemption of shares  liquidation or merger.g) The vesting of Options will be subject to the Sobi Group's actual average revenues reaching or exceeding the Sobi Group's average target revenues for the Management Programme as set by the Board of Directors each year over the financial years 2024-2026. If the threshold is reached or exceeded  full vesting of Options will occur. If the threshold is not reached  no vesting of Options will occur.h) In order for a Management Programme participant to be eligible to exercise Options it is a condition that  with certain specific exemptions  he/she has been permanently employed within the Sobi Group from the start of the Vesting Period up until the time of exercise of Options.i) If significant changes in the Sobi Group or in the market occur which would result in a situation where the Board of Directors considers the number of Options subject to exercise to be unreasonable  the Board of Directors shall be entitled to reduce the number of Options subject to exercise. Such reduction may result in the number of Options subject to exercise being reduced to zero. Further  the value of each Sobi common share received upon exercise of Options shall be capped to three times the Strike Price  meaning that the number of Sobi common shares delivered to Management Programme participants upon exercise of Options may be reduced.II. The All Employee ProgrammeIt is proposed that the All Employee Programme be open to approximately 940 permanent employees of the Sobi Group ("" Employees "")  on the following terms and conditions and the terms and conditions set out in item A.III below.a) The All Employee Programme will require Employees to make investments of their own in common shares in Sobi on Nasdaq Stockholm ("" Employee Investment Shares ""). For each Employee Investment Share  the Employees will have the possibility to be allocated two common shares in Sobi free of charge ("" Employee Matching Shares "")  from Sobi or from a designated third party. The Employee Matching Shares will be allocated following expiration of the three-year vesting period beginning on the date that Sobi starts inviting the Employees to participate in the All Employee Programme (the "" Vesting Period ""). Sobi must invite the Employees to participate in the All Employee Programme no later than on 31 December 2024.b) The maximum number of Employee Investment Shares each Employee may invest in depends on the gross annual average fixed salary for Employees during 2024. Employee Investment Shares may be acquired for an amount corresponding to no more than 2.5% of the gross annual average fixed salary for Employees during 2024.c) All Employee Programme participants must purchase Employee Investment Shares in connection with the start of the Vesting Period.d) Employee Matching Shares may be allocated only after the expiration of the Vesting Period  unless the Board of Directors of Sobi in an individual case resolves otherwise.e) In order for an All Employee Programme participant to be allocated Employee Matching Shares it is a condition that  with certain specific exemptions  he/she has been permanently employed within the Sobi Group for the duration of the whole Vesting Period and that the participant  until the expiration of this Vesting Period  has retained the Employee Investment Shares purchased. Any disposal of Employee Investment Shares prior to the expiration of the Vesting Period will generally result in no Employee Matching Shares being allocated.III. Terms and conditions applying to the Management Programme and the All Employee Programmea) The Board of Directors shall be authorised to establish the detailed terms and conditions for the Programmes. The Board of Directors may  in that regard  make necessary or appropriate adjustments to satisfy certain regulations or market conditions outside Sweden   including  among other things  to offer cash settlement.b) Participation in the Programmes presupposes that such participation is legally possible in the various jurisdictions concerned and that the administrative costs and financial efforts are reasonable in the opinion of the Board of Directors.c) The Programmes shall jointly comprise no more than 3 984 296 common shares in Sobi  of which 1 422 319 constitute Management Performance Shares  1 562 878 constitute Option Shares and 171 080 constitute Employee Matching Shares. The remaining 828 019 common shares in Sobi are such shares that may be transferred by Sobi in order to cover the cash flow effects associated with the Programmes  primarily social security charges.d) The number of Employee Matching Shares  Option Shares and Management Performance Shares  will be subject to recalculation as a result of intervening bonus issues  splits  rights issues and/or other similar corporate events.________________________Costs for the Programmes etc.The costs for the Programmes  which are charged in the profit and loss account  are calculated according to the accounting standard IFRS 2 and distributed on a linear basis over the Vesting Period. The calculation has been made based on the following assumptions: (i) a market price of the Sobi common share of SEK 257  (ii) no dividend is paid by Sobi during the Programmes  (iii) an assessment of future volatility in respect of the Sobi common share  (iv) full vesting of Management Performance Shares related to annual revenues will occur  and (v) full vesting of Options. In total  this can lead to maximum costs for the Programmes of approximately SEK 290.9 million  excluding social security costs. The costs for social security charges are calculated to approximately SEK 130.5 million assuming an annual share price increase of 10% during the Vesting Period. In addition to what is set forth above  the maximum costs for the Programmes have been based on a share price of SEK 257 at the time of the commencement of the Vesting Period  that the Programmes comprise 1 290 participants in total  that each All Employee Programme participant makes a maximum investment and based on historical employee turnover for the Sobi Group of 12%. If the share price increases from SEK 257 with 10% until the implementation of the Programmes the effect on costs would only be marginal as the number of Employee Matching Shares  Option Shares and Management Performance Shares would be reduced correspondingly. Also in case of a decrease in the share price the effect on costs would be marginal. Based on the assumptions above the annual costs for the Programmes  including social security charges  corresponds to approximately 3.1% of Sobi's total annual employee costs.If the Programmes had been implemented in 2023  if Sobi had had costs in accordance with the example in the preceding paragraph  and Employee Matching Shares  Management Performance Shares and Option Shares had been allocated in 2023 in accordance with the assumptions in the sample calculation  which among other things assumes an annual share price increase of 10% during the Vesting Period  the earnings per share for the financial year 2023 had decreased by SEK 0.44 to SEK 7.03 and the shareholders' equity per share for the financial year 2023 had decreased by SEK 1.19 to SEK 94.41.DilutionUpon full allocation of Employee Matching Shares  Management Performance Shares and Option Shares  the number of shares under the Programmes amounts to 3 156 277 common shares in Sobi  corresponding to a dilution effect of approximately 0.92% of the share capital and the votes. Aggregated with the 828 019 shares that may be transferred in order to cover the cash flow effects associated with the Programmes  primarily social security charges  the maximum dilution effect of the Programmes amounts to approximately 1.16% of the share capital and the votes. If all outstanding long-term incentive programmes are included in the calculation  then the corresponding maximum level of dilution amounts to 4.56%.Hedging arrangementsThe Board of Directors has considered different methods for transfer of shares under the Programmes  in order to implement the Programmes in a cost-effective and flexible manner. The Board of Directors has found the most cost-effective alternative to be  and thus proposes that the Annual General Meeting as a main alternative  with separate resolutions for the Management Programme and the All Employee Programme  resolves on (i) a directed issue of redeemable and convertible series C shares and (ii) an authorisation for the Board of Directors to resolve on the repurchase of all issued redeemable and convertible series C shares. Following conversion to common shares in Sobi  the shares are intended to be transferred to the participants of the Programmes as well as transferred on a regulated market in order to cover the cash flow effects associated with the Programmes  primarily social security charges. For this purpose  the Board of Directors further proposes that the Annual General Meeting  with separate resolutions for the Management Programme and the All Employee Programme  resolves (iii) on transfers of own common shares free of charge to the participants of the Programmes. As further described in item B.I.iii) and B.II.iii)  respectively  below  the Board of Directors proposes that shares acquired for the purpose of securing Sobi's obligations under previous incentive programmes also may be transferred under the Programmes. The detailed conditions for the Board of Directors' main alternative are set out in item B.I and B.II  respectively  below.Since the Programmes  in principle  are not expected to give rise to any initial social security payments for the Sobi Group  the Board of Directors has decided not to propose to the Annual General Meeting 2024 to resolve on transfers of own common shares on a regulated market in order to cover such payments. However  prior to the transfers of common shares to the participants of the Programmes  the Board of Directors intends to propose to the Annual General Meeting 2026  2027 and 2028 that transfers be made of own common shares on a regulated market in order to cover such costs.Should the majority required under item B.I and/or B.II below not be reached  the Board of Directors proposes that Sobi shall be able to enter into an equity swap agreement with a third party  in accordance with item C. below.Preparations of the proposalThe Compensation & Benefits Committee of Sobi has prepared guidelines for the proposed Programmes. These guidelines have been presented for and adopted by the Board of Directors.The Board of Directors has established shareholding guidelines which recommend that the CEO and other members of the Executive Committee accumulate personal holdings in Sobi shares representing a value of an annual gross base salary for the CEO and 50% of an annual gross base salary for other members of the Executive Committee  by maintaining Sobi shares already held as well as Sobi shares allocated under the Programmes and under previous incentive programmes. It is recommended that the personal holding of shares is established within three years from being appointed Executive Committee Member. It is recommended that the CEO and other Executive Committee members maintain shares of such a value for the duration of their appointment as CEO or other Executive Committee member.________________________Hedging arrangements in respect of the ProgrammesB.

The reason for the proposed possibility to repurchase own shares is that Sobi shall be able to fulfil its obligations pursuant to the All Employee Programme in a cost-effective manner.iii) Resolution on transfers of own common shares to the participants of the All Employee ProgrammeThe Board of Directors proposes that the shares issued and repurchased in accordance with items B.II.i) and B.II.ii) above  following conversion to common shares  may be transferred under the All Employee Programme.Transfers of Sobi's own common shares to the participants of the All Employee Programme may be made on the following terms:a) Transfers may be made only of common shares in Sobi  whereby a maximum of 171 080 common shares in Sobi (all Employee Matching Shares) may be transferred free of charge to participants of the All Employee Programme.b) Right to purchase common shares in Sobi free of charge shall – with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights – be granted to such persons within the Sobi Group who are participants in the All Employee Programme.c) Transfers of common shares in Sobi shall be made free of charge at the time and on the other terms that the All Employee Programme's participants are entitled to be allocated shares.d) The number of common shares in Sobi that may be transferred under the All Employee Programme will be subject to recalculation as a result of intervening bonus issues  splits  rights issues and/or other similar corporate events.C.

A valid resolution under item B.I above and B.II above respectively  requires that shareholders representing not less than nine-tenths of the votes cast as well as of the shares represented at the Annual General Meeting approve the resolution. A valid resolution under item C. above requires a simple majority of the votes cast.The issues  repurchases and transfers of shares in Sobi described above are integral parts of the proposed Programmes. Therefore  and in light of the above  the Board of Directors considers it to be advantageous for Sobi and the shareholders that the Programmes' participants are invited to become shareholders in Sobi.For the purpose of minimising Sobi's costs for the Programmes  the subscription price has been set at the quotient value of the share.Previous incentive programmes in SobiFor a description of the company's other long-term incentive programmes  reference is made to the company's annual report for 2023  note 10  and the company's website  www.sobi.com . No other long-term incentive programmes than those described herein or in the annual report for 2023  note 10  have been implemented in Sobi.Authorisation for the CEOThe Board of Directors proposes that the CEO shall be authorised to make the minor adjustments to the above resolution regarding the directed issues of redeemable and convertible series C shares in connection with the registration thereof with the Swedish Companies Registration Office (Sw: Bolagsverket ) and Euroclear Sweden AB.Approval to authorise the issuance of new shares and/or convertible bonds and/or warrants (item 19)The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to authorise the Board of Directors to resolve  on one or several occasions  prior to the next Annual General Meeting  on a pre-emptive or non-pre-emptive basis  on the issuance of shares and/or convertible bonds and/or warrants.

The number of shares that may be issued  the number of shares that convertible bonds may be converted into and the number of shares that may be subscribed for by the exercise of warrants may not exceed 39 370 000 shares in total.If the authorisation is exercised in full  the dilution would amount to approximately 10% of the number of shares in the company (counted after the authorisation has been fully exercised).The Board of Directors  or any person appointed by it  is authorised to make any minor adjustments to the resolution that may be necessary to enable registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.Majority requirements  etc.The purpose of the authorisation is to enable payment through the issuance of own financial instruments in connection with possible transactions that the company may make as well as to raise capital in order to finance completed or future transactions that the company may make.

Therese Utengen is proposed by Grant Thornton Sweden AB as auditor in charge if they are elected. The proposal is in accordance with the board of directors' recommenda�on. The board of directors' proposal regarding guidelines for compensa�on to senior execu�ves (item 17) According to chapter 8 sec�on 51 of the Swedish Companies Act (Sw. aktiebolagslagen)  the board of directors is obliged to draw up a proposal for new guidelines for remunera�on to senior execu�ves when there is a need for substan�al changes to the guidelines  but at any event at least every four years. The current guidelines were adopted at the 2020 annual general mee�ng and new guidelines must therefore be adopted at the 2024 annual general mee�ng. The board of directors proposes that the annual general mee�ng decide on the following guidelines for remunera�on to senior execu�ves in Medivir. The proposed guidelines are in all material aspects corresponding to the guidelines adopted at the 2020 annual general mee�ng. However  it has been clariﬁed that pension beneﬁts can exceed 25 percent of the ﬁxed salary if this follows from the applicablecollec�ve agreement. Furthermore  the no�ce period for the CEO has been adjusted. Senior execu�ves includes the managing director and other persons in the group management. The guidelines should be applied to compensa�on that is agreed upon  and changes that are made to already agreed compensa�on  a�er the guidelines have been adopted by the annual general mee�ng in 2024. The guidelines do not cover compensa�on that is decided by the general mee�ng. The guidelines' promotion of Medivir's business strategy  long-term interests and sustainability Medivir creates shareholder value by developing innova�ve cancer medicines for major medical needs  either in-houseor in partnership with other companies. For further informa�on on Medivir's business strategy  please visit the Company´s website www.medivir.com. The successful implementa�on of the business strategy and the safeguarding of Medivir's long-terminterests  including its sustainability  requires that Medivir can recruit and retain competent employees who work to achieve maximum shareholder and customer value. This requires that Medivir can oﬀer compe��ve remunera�on. These guidelines enable senior execu�ves to be oﬀered a compe��ve total compensa�on. In Medivir  long-term incen�ve programs have been established by two warrant programs and a share matching program. They have been decided by the general mee�ng and are therefore not covered by these guidelines. For the same reason  the incen�ve program that the board has proposed that the annual general mee�ng in 2024 should adopt is also not covered. More informa�on about the previous incen�ve programs is available on Medivir´s website. The forms of compensation etc. The compensa�on for senior execu�ves must be market-based and may consist of the following components: ﬁxed cash salary  variable cash compensa�on  pension beneﬁts and other beneﬁts. The general mee�ng can in addi�on - and independently of these guidelines - decide on  for example  share and share price-related compensa�on. The total compensa�on for senior execu�ves should contain a balanced mix of the above-men�oned components and condi�ons in the event of termina�on as well as severance pay. The board should annually evaluate whether share or share price-relatedlong-term incen�ve programs should be proposed to the general mee�ng. The ﬁxed cash salary must be individual and based on the senior execu�ve's areas of responsibility and experience. The variable cash compensa�on may amount to no more than 50 percent of the ﬁxed annual cash salary. For senior execu�ves  pension beneﬁts must be deﬁned contribu�on unless the execu�ve is covered by a deﬁned beneﬁt pension according to mandatory collec�ve agreement provisions. Variable cash compensa�on must be pensionable. The pension premiums for a deﬁned contribu�on pension must amount to a maximum of 25 percent of the ﬁxed annual cash salary  unless otherwise s�pulated in the collec�ve agreement. The board shall have the right to oﬀer other solu�ons that are cost-equivalent for the company  regardless of the above. Other beneﬁts may include i.a. company car and occupa�onal health care. Such beneﬁts must be of limited value in rela�on to other compensa�on and be consistent with what is market-wise customary in the respec�ve geographic market. Other beneﬁts may total no more than 15 percent of the ﬁxed annual cash salary. Termination of employment Upon termina�on of the senior execu�ve's employment  a mutual no�ce period of no more than six months shall apply. As far as the CEO is concerned  however  the no�ce period in case of termina�on bythe company can amount to a maximum of 12 months. Fixed cash salary should be paid during the no�ce period. As a star�ng point  severance payments or similar compensa�on shall not be paid. Criteria for distribution of variable cash compensation  etc. Variable cash compensa�on must be linked to predetermined and measurable criteria  which can be ﬁnancial or non-ﬁnancial  designed with the aim of promo�ng the company's long-term value crea�on. The criteria should relate to the development in the development projects the Company conducts and the partnerships the Company enters into for the accelera�on of clinical development and future commercializa�on  as well as the compensa�on (for example  one-oﬀ payments at the conclusion of the agreement  milestone compensa�on  compensa�on for research services  or royal�es) this development results in. The criteria must further be designed to promote Medivir's business strategy and long-term interests  including its sustainability. Fulﬁllment of criteria for payment of variable cash compensa�on must be measured over a period of one year. When the measurement period for fulﬁllment of criteria for the payment of variable cash compensa�on has ended  the extent to which the criteria have been fulﬁlled must be determined. The board is responsible for the assessment regarding variable cash compensa�on to senior execu�ves. As far as ﬁnancial targets are concerned  the assessment must be based on the ﬁnancial informa�on most recently published by the company. Salary and employment conditions for employees When preparing the board's proposal for these remunera�on guidelines  salary and employment condi�ons for the company's employees have been taken into account. Informa�on regarding the employees' total remunera�on  the components of the remunera�on as well as the increase and rate of increase of the remunera�on over �me have formed part of the board's decision-making basis when evalua�ng the fairness of the guidelines and the restric�ons that follow from these. The decision-making process for establishing  reviewing and implementing the guidelines The board has not set up a remunera�on commitee  but the tasks assigned to such a commitee is carried out by the board of directors in its en�rety. The board's proposal for guidelines for remunera�on to senior execu�ves has therefore been prepared by the board. The board must draw up proposals for new guidelines at least every four years and submit the proposal for decision at the annual general mee�ng. The guidelines shall apply un�l new guidelines are adopted by the general mee�ng. Since the board has not established a remunera�on commitee  the board is also responsible for following and evalua�ng programs for variable remunera�on for group management  the applica�on of guidelines for remunera�on to senior execu�ves and current remunera�on structures and remunera�on levels in the group. In the board's considera�on of and decisions on remunera�on-related maters  the CEO or other senior execu�ves are not present  to the extent that they are aﬀected by the maters. Deviation from the guidelines The board may decide to temporarily deviate from the guidelines in whole or in part  if in an individual case there are special reasons for it and a devia�on is necessary to sa�sfy Medivir's long-term interests  including its sustainability  or to ensure Medivir's ﬁnancial viability. Additional information Addi�onal informa�on regarding compensa�on to senior execu�ves can be found in the annual report of Medivir. The board of directors' proposal on a share issue authoriza�on (item19) The board proposes that the annual general mee�ng resolves to authorize to the board  up and un�l the next annual general mee�ng  on one or several occasions and with or without pre-emp�ve rights forshareholders  to resolve on the issue of new ordinary shares  comprising a total of not more than 20 per cent of the total number of outstanding shares in the company a�er the u�liza�on of the authoriza�on. It shall also be possible to make such an issue resolu�on s�pula�ng in-kind payment  the right to oﬀset debt or other condi�ons referred to in Chapter 13 Sec�on 5 ﬁrst paragraph item 6 in the Swedish Companies Act. The purpose of the authoriza�on is to give the board ﬂexibility in the work of ensuring that capital can be added to the company in an appropriate manner for the ﬁnancing of the business. Issuance of new shares with the support of the authoriza�on must be carried out on market terms. The board of directors' proposal regarding a long-term incen�ve program in the form of a share matching program (LTIP 2024) (item 20) The board of directors proposes that the annual general mee�ng resolves to adopt a long-term incen�ve program in the form of a share matching program for key employees within the Medivir group in accordance with item 20(a) below. The resolu�on in accordance with item 20(a) shall be condi�onal upon the annual general mee�ng resolving to adopt the hedging arrangements with respect to the incen�ve program in accordance with the board of directors' proposal under item 20(b) below. Adop�on of the incen�ve program (item 20(a)) Summary of the program The board of directors proposes that the annual general mee�ng resolves to adopt a long-term incen�ve program in the form of a share matching program (the ""LTIP 2024""). LTIP 2024 is proposed to include not more than 11 key employees within the Medivir group. The par�cipants in LTIP 2024 are required to invest in the group by acquiring shares in Medivir AB (publ) with the purpose of being allocated to LTIP 2024 (""Investment Shares""). For each Investment Share  the par�cipant has the right to  provided certain condi�ons are fulﬁlled  receive one (1) ordinary share under LTIP 2024 free of charge (""Matching Shares"") and  provided certain performance condi�ons are fulﬁlled  a maximum of ﬁve (5) addi�onal ordinary shares free of charge (""Performance Shares"") in accordance with the terms set outbelow. Personal investment In order to par�cipate in LTIP 2024  the par�cipant must make a private investment by acquiring Investment Shares. The Investment Shares shall be acquired at market price with the purpose of being allocated to LTIP 2024. The maximum number of Investment Shares that each par�cipant can allocate to LTIP 2024 is further described below and corresponds to an amount of approximately 3-7 per cent of each par�cipant's annual base salary. For each Investment Share held under LTIP 2024  the company will grant par�cipants one (1) right to one (1) Matching Share  meaning the right to receive one Matching Share free of charge (""Matching Rights"") and in addi�on  provided that certain performance condi�ons are fulﬁlled  a maximum of ﬁve (5) addi�onal rights to ﬁve (5) Performance Shares free of charge (""Performance Rights"") in accordance with the terms set out below (Matching Rights and Performance Rights are together referred to as ""Rights""). Terms and conditions The Matching Rights may be exercised provided that the par�cipant  with certain excep�ons  as of the start of LTIP 2024 for the par�cipant and up un�l and including the date of release of the interim report for the period January - March 2027 (the ""Ves�ng Period"") has kept its own original Investment Shares and that the par�cipant  with certain excep�ons  maintains its employment within the Medivir group. LTIP 2024 shall start as soon as prac�cable a�er the annual general mee�ng 2024. The last day for allotment of the Rights shall be 31 December 2024. Newly employed key employees in Medivir may be invited to par�cipate in LTIP 2024 up un�l 31 December 2024  and shall then make their ﬁrst investment in Investment Shares within the ﬁrst two weeks a�er the ﬁrst day of employment. The Matching Shares are received a�er the end of the Ves�ng Period. The board considers that in these cases it is jus�ﬁed that the Ves�ng Period is shorter than three years since it enables the company to assign newemployees Rights within the framework of LTIP 2024  which is deemed to be beneﬁcial for the company from a recruitment perspec�ve. The Performance Rights may be exercised provided that  in addi�on to the requirement for the par�cipant's con�nued employment and a retained Investment Share investment in accordance with the above  certain performance condi�ons are fulﬁlled. A par�cipant's Performance Rights en�tle to a maximum number of Performance Shares of ﬁve (5) per Investment Share if the total shareholder return (shareholder return in the form of an increase of the price of the company's share and reinvestment of poten�al dividends during the term of LTIP 2024) (""TSR"")1 on Medivir's share during the period from March 2024 to March 2027 (the ""Performance Period"") amounts to or exceeds 100 per cent (corresponding to approximately 33.33 per cent per year). For allotment under the performance condi�ons  the TSR on the company's ordinary shares must amount to or exceed 50 per cent (corresponding to approximately 16.67 per cent per year) during the Performance Period  which would en�tle the par�cipant to one (1) Performance Share per Investment Share. In between the percentages  allotment will be made linearly. Performance Shares are received a�er the end of the Ves�ngPeriod. The Rights The Rights shall  in addi�on to what is set out above  be governed by the following terms and condi�ons: The Rights are granted free of charge as soon as prac�cable a�er the start of LTIP 2024 provided that the par�cipant has made a private investment by acquiring Investment Shares. The last day for allotment of the Rights shall be 31 December 2024. Rights that fall due according to the terms must be returned and can be granted again up un�l 31 December 2024.The Matching Rights and the Performance Rights vest during the Ves�ng Period. The performance condi�ons of the Performance Rights are assessed during the Performance Period.The Rights may not be transferred or pledged.Each Matching Right en�tles the par�cipant to receive one (1) Matching Share free of charge a�er the end of the Ves�ng Period (with certain excep�ons where the �ming of the receival may be accelerated) if the par�cipant  with certain excep�ons  maintains its employment within the Medivir group and the invested Investment Shares un�l the �me of the release of the interim report for the period January - March 2027. Each Performance Right en�tles the par�cipant to receive one (1) Matching Share free of charge a�er the end of the Ves�ng Period (with certain excep�ons where the Ves�ng Period may be accelerated) if the performance condi�ons set out above are fulﬁlled and provided that the par�cipant maintains its employment within the Medivir group and the invested Investment Shares during the Ves�ng Period.In order to align the par�cipants' and the shareholders' interests  the company will compensate the par�cipants for any dividends paid by increasing the number of Matching Shares and Performance Shares that the Rights en�tle to at the end of the Ves�ngPeriod.The maximum value per Matching Right and Performance Right  respec�vely  is limited to a sum (corresponding to ten (10) �mes the closing price of the company's ordinary shares on the date of the ﬁrst alloca�on of LTIP 2024). In the event that the value of such Right exceeds such limit  the number of Matching Shares and Performance Shares will be decreased on a pro rata basis. TSR is calculated by comparing the weighted average price of the shares during March 2024 with the weighted average price of the shares during March 2027  including reinvested dividend. according to the terms must be returned and can be granted again up un�l 31 December 2024.Preparation and administration The board of directors shall be responsible for preparing the detailed terms and condi�ons of LTIP 2024  in accordance with the above terms and condi�ons  including provisions on recalcula�on in the event of a bonus issue  split  rights issue and/or other similar events.

38760,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/ARTMARKET-COM-5174/news/Artmarket-com-Artmarket-com-the-Artprice100-C-index-was-up-1-55-in-2023-46362935/,Artmarket.com :  Artmarket.com: the Artprice100(C) index was up 1.55% in 2023,(marketscreener.com)  The simulated portfolio put together by Artprice to evaluate the annual performance of a weighted investment in the world's 100 top-selling blue-chip artists on the global art auction market continued to grow with an overall return on …,"The simulated portfolio put together by Artprice to evaluate the annual performance of a weighted investment in the world's 100 top-selling blue-chip artists on the global art auction market continued to grow with an overall return on investment of 1.55 % between January 1  2023  and December 31  2023.The portfolio's yield in 2023 was lower than the annual average of 10% recorded since 2000  but it nevertheless proves that works by blue-chip artists still grow in value even during periods of art market adjustment. Lacking major masterpieces since the sale of the Paul G. Allen Collection in 2022  the major auction houses have focused on offering a greater volume of works  including works that are more accessible  more recent or  which return to auction more quickly. But  even during this shift in focus  the popularity of blue-chip artists has continued to increase.“Artprice's latest annual report  “The Art Market in 2023” underscores the shift from a sellers' market to a buyers' market in 2023  explains thierry Ehrmann  CEO and Founder of Artmarket.com and its Artprice department. “During such periods  the balance of power tends to switch from the sellers to the buyers with the latter now being able to afford to be more demanding. But this shift has the effect of slowing the high-end segment  by reducing the availability of works likely to fetch over a million dollars. However  even in these circumstances  Artprice recorded a slight increase in prices for works by Blue-Chips artists.Artprice100© vs. S&P 500 and STOXX Europe 50 – Base 100 in January 2000[ https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2024/04/image1-artprice100-vs-sandp500-vs-stoxx-europe-50.png ]Calculation principle of the Artprice100©On 1 January 2023  Artprice updated its portfolio respecting the same investment strategy as in previous years. This consists of maintaining fictitious stakes in the world's 100 top-selling artists on the secondary market  with the stakes adjusted annually based on the artists' annual auction turnover and the market liquidity of their works over the previous 5-year period. The relative weight of each artist in the portfolio at the start of every year is therefore proportional to the relative turnover their works have generated over the previous five years  and this figure is then adjusted by a market liquidity factor. The exact breakdown of the portfolio as of 1 January 2023 is provided below in the section Composition of Artprice100© as of 1 January 2023.On 31 December 2023  Artprice noted the theoretical change in value for each of the 100 artists in the portfolio based on the evolution of their respective price indices over the previous year. These indices are calculated by Artprice on all auction results recorded during the year 2023  for all categories of Fine Art works  with the exception of Prints and Multiples which constitute a separate market.For example  investment in works by Gerhard Richter (1932) represented 2.8% of the Artprice100© portfolio on 1 January 2023  and his price index increased by +21% over the following twelve months. The investment in works by Jean-Michel Basquiat (1960-1988) represented 3.9% of the portfolio at the start of 2023  but his price index fell by -15% in 2023.But  despite the heaviest-weighted artists recording price contractions in 2023 (particularly Pablo Picasso  Andy Warhol  and Claude Monet who between them accounted for almost a fifth of the portfolio) the Artprice100© portfolio  which is highly diversified  ended the year in positive territory. So  at the end of 2023  the overall ROI for the 100 artists in the Artprice100© was +1.55%.Composition of the Artprice100© Index as of 1 January 2023[ https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2024/04/image2-artprice100-composition-2023.jpg ]Due to the rarity of works by Old Masters  they are now practically absent from the composition of the Artprice100© portfolio. Only the great Chinese master Dong Qichang (1555-1636) was included at the start of 2023 with a 0.3% theoretical investment.The share of 19th-Century artists has increased significantly. The spectacular results recorded in 2022 for Vincent van Gogh (1853-1890) and Paul Cézanne (1839-1906) during the sale of the Paul G. Allen Collection significantly raised their participation when the portfolio was adjusted at the start of the following year (2023). In total  19th Century artists represented 12% of the portfolio at the start of 2023  compared with 10% at the beginning of 2022.Weight of the five major creative periods in the Artprice100© in 2023Modern Art remained the largest segment in the composition of the Artprice100© index  accounting for 43% of the initial 2023 investment. The Belgian Surrealist René Magritte (1898-1967) and the Chinese master Qi Baishi (1864-1957) have both been included in the composition of the Artprice100© for around ten years  but the dynamics of their respective markets are currently following very different paths: while the prices of works by René Magritte are increasing quickly (+38%)  Qi Baishi's prices recorded a contraction of around -22% in 2023.This year  the Post-War Art period accounted for 5 of the top 10 artists in the Artprice100© Index. Among them  the weight of the Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama (b.1929) in the portfolio is continuing to grow  driven by tremendous global success. With 812 lots sold at auction in 2023 for a total of $193 million  Yayoi Kusama is currently the 8th top-selling artist on the global art auction market (all creative periods combined) and the world's most in-demand female artist. In 2023  Gerhard Richter was the only living artist whose auction turnover was higher than Kusama's.Lastly  in our 2023 Artprice100© portfolio  Contemporary Art represented 13% of the initial investment. The youngest artist in the portfolio was the Romanian painter Adrian Ghenie (b.1977)  represented by the Plan-B  Thaddaeus Ropac  Tim Van Laere  and Pace galleries.Composition of Artprice100©: Artist and weight in the initial Artprice100© portfolio for 20231.

These guidelines are forward-looking  i.e.  they are applicable to remuneration agreed  and amendments to remuneration already agreed  after adoption of the guidelines by the annual general meeting 2024. These guidelines do not apply to any remuneration already decided or approved by the general meeting.The guidelines' promotion of the Company's business strategy  long-term interests  and sustainabilityVicore is a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on developing innovative medicines in severe lung diseases and other indications where the angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT2R) plays an important role.For more information about the Company  please see Vicore Pharma's corporate presentation at: https://vicorepharma.com/investors/events-presentations/.A prerequisite for the successful implementation of the Company's business strategy and safeguarding of its long-term interests  including its sustainability  is that the Company is able to recruit and retain qualified personnel. To this end  it is necessary that the Company offers a competitive remuneration applicable to the countries and regions where the Company operates.These guidelines enable the Company to offer the executive management a competitive total remuneration.Variable cash remuneration covered by these guidelines shall aim at promoting the Company's business strategy and long-term interests  including its sustainability.The Company also has long-term share-related incentive plans in place. The plans have been resolved by the general meeting and aim to align the interests of the board members and key employees with those of the shareholders.Types of remunerationThe remuneration shall be on market terms and may consist of the following components: fixed cash salary  variable cash remuneration  pension  and other benefits. Furthermore  additional variable cash remuneration may be awarded in extraordinary circumstances. Additionally  the general meeting may - irrespective of these guidelines - resolve on  among other things  share-related or share price-related incentive programs. The satisfaction of criteria for awarding variable cash remuneration shall be measured over a period of one to several years. The variable remuneration payable in cash may amount to a maximum of 40 percent of the annual fixed cash salary for the CEO and a maximum of 30 percent of the annual fixed cash salary to other senior executives under the measurement period for such criteria. Further variable cash remuneration may be awarded in extraordinary circumstances  provided that such extraordinary arrangements are limited in time and only made on an individual basis  either for the purpose of recruiting or retaining executives  or as remuneration for extraordinary performance beyond the individual's ordinary tasks. Such remuneration may not exceed an amount corresponding to 50 per cent of the fixed annual cash salary and may not be paid more than once per year for each individual. Any resolution on such remuneration shall be made by the board of directors based on a proposal from the remuneration committee.For the CEO  pension benefits  including long/short term disability insurance (Sw: sjukförsäkring)  shall be premium defined. Variable cash remuneration shall not qualify for pension benefits. The pension premiums for premium defined pension shall amount to not more than 30 per cent of the fixed annual cash salary. For other executives  pension benefits  including health insurance  shall be premium defined unless otherwise required by for example collective agreements. The pension premiums for premium defined pension shall amount to not more than 30 per cent of the fixed annual cash salary.Other benefits may include  for example  life insurance and medical insurance (Sw: sjukvårdsförsäkring). Such benefits may not amount to more than 15 per cent of the fixed annual cash salary.For employments governed by rules other than those of Sweden  pension benefits and other benefits may be duly adjusted for compliance with mandatory rules or established local practice  taking into account  to the extent possible  the overall purpose of these guidelines.Termination of employmentFor all executives (including the CEO)  the notice period may be up to six months if notice of termination of employment is made by the Company. For the CEO  fixed cash salary during the notice period and severance pay may  in total  not exceed twelve months' fixed salary  and for other executives  such remuneration may not correspond to an amount which exceeds six months' fixed salary. The period of notice may be up to six months without any right to severance pay when termination is made by the executive.Additionally  remuneration may be paid for non-compete undertakings. Such remuneration shall compensate for loss of income and shall only be paid in so far as the previously employed executive is not entitled to severance pay. The remuneration shall amount to not more than 60 per cent of the monthly income at the time of termination of employment and be paid during the time the non-compete undertaking applies  however not for more than 12 months following termination of employment.Criteria for awarding variable cash remunerationThe variable cash remuneration shall be linked to predetermined and measurable criteria. These criteria can be measurable advancements in the Company's preclinical and clinical programs and other associated activities. The criteria can be financial or non-financial. They may also be individualized  quantitative or qualitative objectives. The criteria shall be designed so as to contribute to the Company's business strategy and long-term interests  including its sustainability  by for example being clearly linked to the business strategy or the executive's long-term development. The board of directors shall have the possibility  subject to the restrictions that may apply under law or contract  to in whole or in part reclaim variable remuneration paid on incorrect grounds (claw-back).The extent to which criteria for awarding variable cash remuneration have been satisfied shall be determined when the measurement period has ended. The remuneration committee is responsible for the evaluation so far as it concerns variable remuneration to the CEO. For variable cash remuneration to other executives  the CEO is responsible for the evaluation  subject to approval by the board of directors for those executives who report directly to the CEO. For financial objectives  the evaluation shall be based on the latest financial information made public by the Company.Salary and employment conditions for employeesIn the preparation of the board of directors' proposal for these remuneration guidelines  salary and employment conditions for employees of the Company have been taken into account by including information on the employees' total income  the components of the remuneration and increase and growth rate over time  in the remuneration committee's and the board of directors' basis of decision when evaluating whether the guidelines and the limitations set out herein are reasonable.The decision-making process to determine  review and implement the guidelinesThe board of directors has established a remuneration committee. The committee's tasks include preparing the board of directors' decision to propose guidelines for executive remuneration. The board of directors shall prepare a proposal for new guidelines at least every fourth year and submit it to the general meeting. The guidelines shall be in force until new guidelines are adopted by the general meeting. The remuneration committee shall also monitor and evaluate programs for variable remuneration for the executive management  the application of the guidelines for executive remuneration as well as the current remuneration structures and compensation levels in the Company. The members of the remuneration committee are independent of the Company and its executive management. The CEO and other members of the executive management do not participate in the board of directors' processing of and resolutions regarding remuneration-related matters in so far as they are affected by such matters.Derogation from the guidelinesThe board of directors may temporarily resolve to derogate from the guidelines  in whole or in part  if in a specific case there is special cause for the derogation and a derogation is necessary to serve the Company's long-term interests  including its sustainability  or to ensure the Company's financial viability. As set out above  the remuneration committee's tasks include preparing the board of directors' resolutions in remuneration-related matters. This includes any resolutions to derogate from the guidelines.Description of significant changes to the guidelines and how the shareholders' views have been taken into accountThe board of directors has reviewed the description of the Company's business in the remuneration guidelines and made a minor editorial change. No significant changes have been made to these proposed guidelines compared to previously adopted guidelines. No shareholders have provided any comments.Item 16 - Resolution to authorize the board of directors to issue new shares  warrants and convertiblesThe board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to authorize the board of directors  at one or several occasions and for the period until the next annual general meeting  to increase the Company's share capital by issuing new shares  warrants and/or convertibles. Such share issue may be carried out with or without deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights and with or without provisions for contribution in kind  set-off or other conditions. If the issue resolution is made with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  the number of shares that may be issued under the authorization may correspond to not more than 20 per cent of the number of outstanding shares and votes at the time of the annual general meeting.The purpose of the authorization is to increase the financial flexibility of the Company and the general flexibility of the board of directors. Should the board of directors resolve on a share issue with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  the reason for this shall be to finance acquisitions of businesses or assets or to raise capital to finance the Company's projects. The CEO shall be authorized to make such minor adjustments to this resolution that may be necessary in connection with the registration.Item 17 - Resolution on a share-based incentive program for the members of the board of directorsThe nomination committee proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to implement a share-based incentive program for members of the board of directors of the Company (""Board LTIP 2024"") in accordance with items 17a - b below. The resolutions under items 17a - b below are proposed to be conditional upon each other. Should the majority requirement for item 17b not be met  the nomination committee proposes that the Company shall be able to enter into an equity swap agreement with a third party in accordance with item 17c below and resolutions under items 17a and 17c shall then be conditional upon each other.Board LTIP 2024 is a program under which the participants will be granted  free of charge  share awards (""share awards"") that entitle to shares in the Company to be calculated in accordance with the principles stipulated below. The number of share awards will be determined based on the volume weighted average price of the Company's share on Nasdaq Stockholm for the five trading days immediately prior to the grant date (as defined below)  however a maximum of 297 000 share awards may be granted. As part of the implementation of Board LTIP 2024  a maximum of 297 000 warrants can be issued in accordance with item 17b below.Proposal for resolution on adoption of a share-based incentive program for the members of the board of directors (item 17a)The rationale for the proposalThe nomination committee believes that an equity-based incentive program is a central part of a competitive remuneration package in order to attract  retain and motivate internationally competent members to the board of directors. The nomination committee is of the opinion that Board LTIP 2024 will increase and strengthen the participants' dedication to the Company's operations  improve Company loyalty and that Board LTIP 2024 will be beneficial to both the shareholders and the Company.Conditions for share awardsThe following conditions shall apply for the share awards:The share awards shall be granted free of charge to the participants immediately after the annual general meeting.The share awards shall vest over approximately one year corresponding to up to the date of  whichever is earliest  (i) the annual general meeting 2025 or (ii) June 1  2025 (""Vesting Date""). Thus  the vesting period is shorter than three years. The nomination committee considers that a vesting period of approximately one year is more appropriate than a longer vesting period since the board of directors' term is at the longest from an annual general meeting to the next annual general meeting.The earliest point in time at which vested share awards may be exercised shall be the day falling immediately after the Vesting Date.The latest point in time at which vested share awards can be exercised shall be the earlier of (i) 90 days after the last day of service as a member of the board of directors  or (ii) June 1  2034. The nomination committee desires that each board member holds these share awards  or shares received (net after tax) as a result of the share awards  as long as he or she remains being a board member.Each vested share award entitles the holder to receive one share in the Company without any compensation being payable provided that the holder was a member of the board of directors of the Company at Vesting Date.The number of share awards will be recalculated in the event that changes occur in the Company's equity capital structure  such as bonus issue  merger  rights issue  share split or reverse share split  reduction of the share capital or similar measures.The share awards are non-transferable and may not be pledged.The share awards can be granted by the parent company as well as any other company within the group where the Company is parent company.In the event of a public takeover offer  asset sale  liquidation  merger or any other such transaction affecting the Company  the share awards will vest in their entirety upon completion of such transaction.The Share Awards shall otherwise be subject to the terms set forth in the separate agreements with the participants and the detailed terms for Board LTIP 2024 as made available in connection with the complete proposal but separate on the Company's website.AllocationThe share awards under Board LTIP 2024 shall be awarded in accordance with the following. Board LTIP 2024 shall comprise all members of the board of directors. Each participant will be allotted share awards pursuant to the below.The number of share awards will be determined by dividing in total SEK 1 980 000 with the volume weighted average price of the Company's share on Nasdaq Stockholm for the five trading days immediately prior to the grant date. Thus  the number of share awards will be determined in close connection to the date of grant and distributed equal on a 1:1 basis as the fixed annual compensation to board members. That is  SEK 660 000 to the chairman and SEK 220 000 to each member of the board of directors. In addition  the members of the board of directors shall  individually and at their choice  have the right to receive 50 percent of their gross board fees (excluding fees for committee work)  under item 10  in share awards instead of cash compensation. If a  or several  members of the board of directors so decide  and have informed of their decision before grant date  the number of additional share awards received shall be calculated in accordance with the principles above.However  Board LTIP 2024 will not under any circumstance comprise more than a total of 297 000 share awards which  if all share awards are vested in accordance with the vesting conditions above  entitle to a maximum of 297 000 shares in the Company.Should the maximum number of share awards  that may be allocated pursuant to this proposal  be lower than the share awards that are to be allocated pursuant to the formula above  the share awards shall be allocated pro rata.Preparation of the proposalBoard LTIP 2024 has been initiated by the nomination committee of the Company and has been structured based on a current market practice for comparable European (including Swedish) listed companies.DilutionBoard LTIP 2024 will comprise a maximum of 297 000 shares in total  which corresponds to a dilution of approximately 0.3 percent on a fully diluted basis. Taking into account also the shares which may be issued pursuant to previously implemented incentive programs in the Company  the maximum dilution amounts to 0.2 percent on a fully diluted basis. The dilution is expected to have a marginal effect on the Company's key performance indicator ""Earnings per share"". Information about Vicore's existing incentive programs can be found in Vicore's annual report for 2023  note 8  which is available on the Company's website  www.vicorepharma.com.Scope and costs of the programBoard LTIP 2024 will be accounted for in accordance with ""IFRS 2 - Sharebased payments"". IFRS 2 stipulates that the share awards shall be expensed as personnel costs over the vesting period and will be accounted for directly against equity. Personnel costs in accordance with IFRS 2 do not affect the Company's cash flow. Social security costs will be expensed in the income statement according to UFR 7 during the vesting period. The market value of the share awards is calculated to be MSEK 0.9 assuming a maximum of 290 000 share awards. The market value has been determined by way of a Black & Scholes formula.Assuming a volume weighted average price of the Vicore share on Nasdaq Stockholm for the 30 trading days after the grant date of SEK 14.68  the annual cost for the Board LTIP 2024  according to IFRS 2  is estimated at approximately MSEK 0.9 before tax. The estimated IFRS 2 cost has been determined by way of a Black & Scholes formula. The annual cost for social security contributions is estimated at approximately MSEK 1.6  based on an annual increase in the share price of 20 per cent  the aforementioned assumptions and a social security tax rate of 31.42 per cent. The total annual cost for Board LTIP 2024 during the term of the program  including costs according to IFRS 2 and social security charges  is therefore estimated to be approximately MSEK 2.6.The total cost of the Board LTIP 2024  including all costs referred to above and social security charges  is estimated under the assumptions above  and under the assumption that the share awards are exercised the day after the Vesting Date  to amount to approximately MSEK 2.6. The total cost of the Board LTIP 2024  including all costs referred to above and social security charges  is estimated under the assumptions above  and under the assumption that the share awards are exercised the last day for exercise and calculated based on an annual increase in the share price of 20 per cent until then  to amount to approximately MSEK 9.4.Delivery of shares under Board LTIP 2024In order to ensure the delivery of shares under Board LTIP 2024  it is proposed that the annual general meeting resolves to issue warrants in accordance with item 17b below.Proposal regarding issue of warrants (item 17b)In order to ensure the delivery of shares under Board LTIP 2024  it is proposed that the annual general meeting resolves to issue a maximum of 297 000 warrants  whereby the Company's share capital may be increased by a maximum of approximately SEK 148 499 998559 in accordance with the following:The right to subscribe for the warrants shall  with deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights  only vest with a fully owned subsidiary to Vicore. The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights is the implementation of Board LTIP 2024.Vicore's wholly-owned subsidiary shall be entitled to transfer the warrants to participants in Board LTIP 2024  or a financial intermediary in connection with exercise of the share awards.The warrants shall be issued free of charge and shall be subscribed for on a subscription list no later than June 1  2024. The board of directors may extend the subscription period. The detailed terms of the warrants are set out in Schedule A .The exercise price for subscription for shares based on the warrants shall correspond to the share's quota value.The Company's CEO shall be authorized to make such minor adjustments that may be necessary in connection with the registration of the new issue.Notification of subscription of shares by the exercise of warrants can be made from and including the day of registration of the warrants with the Swedish Companies' Office up until and including June 15  2034.Shares which are issued following subscription shall entitle to participation in the distribution of profits for the first time on the nearest record date occurring after the subscription has been exercised.Equity swap agreement with a third party (item 17c)Should the majority requirement for item 17b above not be met  it is proposed that the annual general meeting resolves that Board LTIP 2024 shall instead be hedged so that the board of directors is authorized  on the Company's behalf  to enter into an equity swap agreement with a third party on terms in accordance with market practice  whereby the third party in its own name shall be entitled to acquire and transfer shares of the Company to the participants.Majority requirementsA resolution in accordance with item 16 above requires approval of at least two thirds (2/3) of the shares represented and votes cast at the general meeting. A resolution in accordance with item 17b above requires approval of at least nine-tenths (9/10) of the shares represented and votes cast at the general meeting.Shareholders' right to request informationShareholders are reminded of their right to  at the annual general meeting  obtain information from the board of directors and CEO in accordance with Chapter 7  Section 32 of the Swedish Companies Act.

While recent moves by key market players provide a positive for its price growth  restaking risks are gradually becoming a major concern. Here's Friday's ETH market movers:Asset manager DWS Group  which handles a portfolio of around $900 billion  launched Bitcoin and Ethereum ETCs on the German stock exchange Deutsche Borse on Thursday. The ETCs  launched in partnership with digital investment manager Galaxy Digital Holdings  aim to track the price performance of Bitcoin and Ethereum. According to a press release by DWS  the ETCs are backed by their respective individual assets custodied by Zodia Custody and Coinbase  ""which store the cryptocurrencies in segregated offline ('cold storage') custody accounts.”The launching of DWS's Ethereum-based commodity product comes at a time when questions surround its ""commodity"" status in the US. After Fortune's report that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is cracking down on the Ethereum Foundation in a bid to classify Ethereum as a security  many have expressed doubts that the SEC will approve applications for a spot Ethereum ETF. In an X discussion on Wednesday between Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart and Cory Klippsten  CEO of Bitcoin financial service firm Swan.com  the former reiterated that the SEC would find it difficult to classify Ethereum as a security after approving a commodity-based Ethereum futures ETF.Moreover  in a report released Wednesday  JP Morgan analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou shed light on the issue by stating that the recent reduction in the staked ETH share of staking protocol Lido raises ""the chance that Ethereum will avoid being as a security in the future."" According to the analysts  the ""Hinman documents"" released in June 2023 clarified the SEC's view of network decentralization's role in deciding if a digital token is a security. They further stated that SEC officials have previously acknowledged that ""tokens on a sufficiently decentralized network are no longer securities because there's no 'controlling group' in the Howey sense.""Also read: Ethereum shows slow movements following criticism of issuance curve article by developerFollowing the report  Ripple announced in a press release on Thursday that it would launch a USD stablecoin on its XRP Ledger and Ethereum.

""Restaking protocols claim they've achieved new levels of efficiency by piggybacking on staking-based security models (...) but those efficiencies also entail risks — risks we don't entirely understand "" said Walbroehl. He cited how these risks align with the problems that caused the Great Financial Crisis of 2008 and the 2022 exploit of Ankr restaking protocol on the BNB network.

Various factors propelled BTC price to rise as discussed next.1. DWS Group Partnership for Exchange-traded commodity (ETC)DWS Group has partnered with Galaxy Digital Holdings Ltd. to introduce two new Xtrackers exchange-traded commodity (ETCs): the Xtrackers Galaxy Physical Bitcoin ETC securities and the Xtrackers Galaxy Physical Ethereum ETC securities. These ETCs were listed on Deutsche Börse and are backed by Coinbase and Zodia Custody.Now  you might be wondering  what exactly are ETCs? Well  think of them as a blend between a debt security and an exchange-traded note  but with added layers of protection for investors. These protections include collateral  limited recourse  and a guarantee that the issuer is not affected by bankruptcy. Unlike exchange traded notes (ETNs)  ETCs can focus on single assets or smaller  more specific asset baskets.The increasing worth of Bitcoin and Ethereum has made them too significant to overlook  prompting DWS to offer direct entry to these assets for investors. The goal of the strategic collaboration between DWS and Galaxy is to speed up the adoption of digital assets in Europe. Each ETC benefits from dedicated offline storage solutions offered by Zodia Custody and Coinbase to ensure security.DWS anticipates that these ETCs will be a budget-friendly choice for investors looking to get into the digital asset market  with a yearly product fee of 0.35%. Galaxy’s extensive knowledge in digital assets will help investors access high-quality digital assets at an institutional level. The partnership between DWS and Galaxy aims to provide investors with a convenient way to trade exchange traded products (ETPs) that are backed by physical assets.This action boosted demand and trust in BTC among European investors by offering them access equivalent to that of institution. The presence of trusted custodians such as Zodia Custody and Coinbase also provided investors with confidence in the security of coin  thereby leading to the surge of Bitcoin price.2. Surge in Accumulation Addresses’ Long-Term InvestmentsThe rise in Bitcoin price can be credited to the large amounts of the cryptocurrency being transferred into accumulation wallets. These addresses are owned by Bitcoin holders who have continuously purchased more tokens without engaging in any selling activities. These investors are commonly known as “HODLers.”Investors are showing strong confidence in Bitcoin’s long-term value by depositing it into these storage accounts. As more Bitcoin is accumulated by these addresses  the supply in the market decreases  causing an increase in demand and price.Recent data indicates that the amount of Bitcoin entering accumulation addresses has been unusually high this month  reaching levels similar to past record highs. This important purchasing behavior by investors who hold onto their assets for a long time is viewed as a good indicator of the digital currency  which probably played a role in its recent price increase.ConclusionIn the dynamic cryptocurrency market  the current Bitcoin price volatility is a natural step in its development towards becoming more established. Even with the necessary changes  Bitcoin still shows resilience and appeal to investors. The increase in price today is a result of both strategic partnerships and investor sentiment  highlighting the changing nature of digital assets.,neutral,0.04,0.94,0.02,mixed,0.53,0.22,0.25,True,English,"['Top Reasons BTC Price', 'Bitcoin Price', 'Xtrackers Galaxy Physical Ethereum ETC securities', 'Xtrackers Galaxy Physical Bitcoin ETC securities', 'two new Xtrackers exchange-traded commodity', 'Bitcoin Price Market Performance advertisement', 'dedicated offline storage solutions', 'Galaxy Digital Holdings Ltd.', 'current Bitcoin price volatility', 'entire digital asset market', 'Top Reasons Bitcoin Price', 'Deutsche Börse', 'specific asset baskets', 'yearly product fee', 'important purchasing behavior', 'entire crypto market', 'other industry market', 'popular crypto choice', 'dynamic cryptocurrency market', 'high-quality digital assets', 'exchange traded products', 'recent price increase', 'physical assets', 'DWS Group Partnership', 'storage accounts', 'digital currency', 'market cap', 'volatile market', 'crypto world', 'budget-friendly choice', 'traded note', 'market value', 'Bitcoin holders', 'rough days', 'necessary step', 'bullish momentum', 'overall outlook', 'past 24 hours', 'leading cryptocurrency', 'past day', 'significant factor', 'continued importance', 'first cryptocurrency', 'Various factors', 'Zodia Custody', 'limited recourse', 'increasing worth', 'direct entry', 'strategic collaboration', 'extensive knowledge', 'institutional level', 'convenient way', 'trusted custodians', 'Long-Term Investments', 'large amounts', 'accumulation wallets', 'selling activities', 'Recent data', 'record highs', 'good indicator', 'natural step', 'necessary changes', 'strategic partnerships', 'investor sentiment', 'changing nature', 'single assets', 'BTC price', 'time high', 'circulating supply', 'limited supply', 'long time', 'trading volume', 'Accumulation Addresses', 'strong confidence', 'long-term value', '19.67 million BTC', '21 million BTC', 'debt security', 'European investors', 'prices', 'cold', 'analysts', 'correction', 'range', 'turnaround', 'CoinMarketCap', 'position', 'fluctuations', 'March', 'scarcity', 'resilience', 'traders', 'ETCs', 'Coinbase', 'blend', 'layers', 'protection', 'collateral', 'guarantee', 'issuer', 'bankruptcy', 'ETNs', 'goal', 'adoption', 'Each', 'ETPs', 'action', 'demand', 'access', 'presence', 'surge', 'rise', 'tokens', 'HODLers', 'levels', 'role', 'Conclusion', 'development', 'appeal', 'result', '1.']",2024-04-05,2024-04-05,coingape.com

(Euronext: AKOM)  a frontrunner in providing broadband connectivity solutions across multiple orbits  has joined forces with IX Acquisition Corp (Nasdaq: IXAQU  ""IXAQ"")  a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) with a focus on the technology  media  and telecommunications sectors. This definitive Business Combination Agreement (""BCA"") has also led to a successful US $35 million private placement.The merger gives birth to AKOM Inc. (""AKOM"")  with plans to transition AERKOMM's listing from Euronext/OTCQX to the Nasdaq stock exchange  adopting the ticker ""AKOM."" The companies aim to retain a secondary listing on Euronext  highlighting the global scale of their ambition.The merger values AERKOMM at an adjusted enterprise value of US $200 million and includes up to US $200 million of earnout shares for AERKOMM's shareholders  contingent upon achieving specific milestones. The financing round consists of US $35 million in common equity PIPE (Private Investment in Public Equity)  supported by both new and existing AERKOMM shareholders. This capital injection could expand prior to the merger's finalization  although the transaction does not hinge on a minimum cash threshold.Upon completion  existing AERKOMM shareholders are expected to transition their stakes entirely  potentially owning about two-thirds of the newly formed AKOM. This equity shift depends on the final PIPE capital and the amount of cash retained in IXAQ's trust. The move to Nasdaq is anticipated to bolster AKOM's capacity to deliver its mission-critical  multi-orbit satellite broadband connectivity services.With a projected closing in Q3 2024  the merger awaits the nod from the SEC  approval from IXAQ and AERKOMM shareholders  and other customary closing conditions.AERKOMM has carved a niche in satellite technology  developing carrier-neutral and software-defined infrastructure that supports end-to-end satellite broadband connectivity for both the public and private sectors. Its collaboration with satellite partners and mobile network operators facilitates seamless connectivity from remote users and platforms to core infrastructure hubs.The company's engagement spans various orbits  including LEO  MEO  GEO  and HEO  and its technologies have been deployed in the Aerospace and Defense sector. AERKOMM's strategic partnerships aim to cater to the burgeoning demand for multi-beam and multi-orbit satellite communication solutions.Anticipated market growth for AERKOMM's target sectors-Aerospace and Defense and Civilian Telecommunications-is expected to surge from approximately $20bn to $60bn by 2030. With its profound technical expertise and innovative solutions  AERKOMM is poised to play a key role in this expansion.Noteworthy advancements by AERKOMM include its high-throughput semiconductor glass antenna and interoperable universal terminals  which promise enhanced broadband connectivity across various sectors. Additionally  the company's commitment to virtualizing core network waveforms signifies a forward-thinking approach to satellite and constellation integration.Louis Giordimaina  CEO of AERKOMM  and Karen Bach  CEO of IXAQ  expressed their enthusiasm for the merger  emphasizing the synergy between AERKOMM's innovative technologies and IXAQ's sector and financial expertise. This partnership is set to accelerate AERKOMM's growth in its key markets  leveraging its pioneering satellite technologies and strengthening its market position.Related LinksAERKOMMSatellite-based Internet technologies",neutral,0.02,0.98,0.0,neutral,0.05,0.94,0.01,True,English,"['IX Acquisition Corp', 'Satellite Broadband Connectivity', 'Deal Boosting', 'AERKOMM', 'mission-critical, multi-orbit satellite broadband connectivity services', 'successful US $35 million private placement', 'definitive Business Combination Agreement', 'high-throughput semiconductor glass antenna', 'multi-orbit satellite communication solutions', 'other customary closing conditions', 'end satellite broadband connectivity', 'Special Purpose Acquisition Company', 'broadband connectivity solutions', 'IX Acquisition Corp', 'Los Angeles CA', 'mobile network operators', 'interoperable universal terminals', 'core network waveforms', 'core infrastructure hubs', 'profound technical expertise', 'pioneering satellite technologies', 'Satellite-based Internet technologies', 'satellite technology landscape', 'minimum cash threshold', 'Nasdaq stock exchange', 'final PIPE capital', 'Anticipated market growth', 'existing AERKOMM shareholders', 'seamless connectivity', 'satellite partners', 'Private Investment', 'private sectors', 'innovative solutions', 'capital injection', 'software-defined infrastructure', 'financial expertise', 'innovative technologies', 'Deal Boosting', 'Clarence Oxford', 'multiple orbits', 'telecommunications sectors', 'global scale', 'enterprise value', 'specific milestones', 'financing round', 'common equity', 'equity shift', 'remote users', 'various orbits', 'strategic partnerships', 'burgeoning demand', 'target sectors', 'Civilian Telecommunications', 'key role', 'Noteworthy advancements', 'various sectors', 'forward-thinking approach', 'constellation integration', 'Louis Giordimaina', 'Karen Bach', 'key markets', 'market position', 'Related Links', 'strategic move', 'secondary listing', 'Public Equity', 'AERKOMM Inc.', 'AKOM Inc.', 'Defense sector', 'SPX', 'Apr', 'Euronext', 'frontrunner', 'forces', 'IXAQU', 'SPAC', 'focus', 'media', 'BCA', 'merger', 'birth', 'plans', 'ticker', 'companies', 'ambition', 'earnout', 'shares', 'new', 'finalization', 'transaction', 'completion', 'stakes', 'two-thirds', 'amount', 'trust', 'capacity', 'Q3', 'nod', 'approval', 'niche', 'carrier-neutral', 'collaboration', 'platforms', 'engagement', 'LEO', 'MEO', 'HEO', 'multi-beam', 'expansion', 'commitment', 'CEO', 'enthusiasm', 'synergy']",2024-04-04,2024-04-05,spacedaily.com

A summary of the consolidated financial statements is included below.Pascal Prigent  CEO of GENFIT commented:“A remarkable milestone was reached by GENFIT in 2023 with the announcement of positive topline data for our Phase 3 ELATIVE® trial evaluating elafibranor in Primary Biliary Cholangitis. We are now fast approaching the PDUFA1 action date for elafibranor and this means that  in 2024  GENFIT could reach another key milestone with the first molecule developed in-house being made available to patients. Approval and commercialization would mean that we would receive additional milestones and a regular stream of royalty payments  which will be used to finance our pipeline now mainly focused on Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure. Looking ahead in 2024  GENFIT will continue to strengthen its leadership in ACLF and intensify collaboration with leading academic institutions and research foundations such as EF CLIF. We are confident that our success in PBC can be replicated in this therapeutic area where the unmet medical need is huge.”2023 Key highlightsPrimary Biliary Cholangitis (PBC): positive results for Phase 3 ELATIVE® trial followed by the validation of the Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for elafibranor by the FDA  EMA and UK MHRA  and publication in the New England Journal of MedicineIn June 2023  GENFIT and Ipsen announced positive 52-week topline data from the pivotal ELATIVE® Phase 3 trial evaluating elafibranor in PBC. In the trial  significant treatment benefit was achieved with elafibranor  with a high responder rate  and a low placebo effect on the primary composite endpoint (a 47% placebo-adjusted difference (p<0.0001) between patients on elafibranor 80mg (51%) compared with patients on placebo (4%) achieving a biochemical response). The key secondary endpoint on serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) normalization was achieved – despite a high baseline ALP level – with high statistical significance. On the other key secondary endpoint using the PBC Worst Itch NRS score  the reduction of pruritus observed for elafibranor versus placebo was not statistically significant. Two other secondary patient-reported outcome measures were used to assess itch  and greater reductions in pruritus were observed with elafibranor compared with placebo at Week 52  according to the itch domain of PBC-40 quality of life questionnaire and 5-D Itch total score. Elafibranor was generally well-tolerated with a well-documented safety profile consistent with previous trials.Full results from the pivotal Phase 3 ELATIVE® trial of elafibranor in PBC were presented as late breaking data at the AASLD congress (Boston  MA) and published in the New England Journal of Medicine in November 2023.These data were used to support submissions to regulatory authorities worldwide for elafibranor as a treatment for patients with PBC having inadequate response or intolerance to ursodeoxycholic acid  the current first-line treatment for PBC.The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Priority Review for New Drug Application (NDA) in December 2023  and the European Medicine Agency (EMA) also validated the Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for elafibranor. A third simultaneous regulatory filing of elafibranor was validated for review by the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).Acceptance of filings in the US and Europe triggered the first milestone payment for GENFIT  which was received in February 2024  in accordance with the Collaboration and Licensing Agreement signed with Ipsen in 2021.Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure (ACLF): GENFIT strengthened leadership and added additional assets to its ACLF franchiseIn May 2023  GENFIT licensed the exclusive worldwide rights of ASK1 inhibitor SRT-015 (injectable formulation in acute liver disease) from Seal Rock Therapeutics  a Seattle  Washington (USA) based clinical stage company developing potential first-in-class and best-in-class kinase inhibitors. This was followed by another asset acquisition in July 2023  where GENFIT licensed the exclusive worldwide rights of CLM-022  a potential first-in-class inflammasome inhibitor  from Celloram. Inc.  a Cleveland  Ohio (USA) based biotechnology company. GENFIT will leverage Celloram’s acquired scientific insights on this molecule to finalize Investigational New Drug (IND) enabling studies of this preclinical stage asset and secure an IND for future clinical trials.GENFIT’s ACLF franchise now includes the following five assets based on differentiated mechanisms of action leveraging complementary pathways.VS-01-ACLF (a liposomal-based technology designed to remove ammonia and other ACLF toxins from the blood). IND was in effect as of April 17  2023 and the first patient was randomized in the UNVEIL-IT ® Phase 2 trial in July 2023. UNVEIL-IT ® is an open-label  randomized  controlled  multi-center  proof of concept study to assess efficacy  safety  and tolerability in addition to standard of care (SOC)  compared to SOC alone  in adult patients with ACLF grades 1 and 2 and ascites.Phase 2 trial in July 2023. UNVEIL-IT is an open-label  randomized  controlled  multi-center  proof of concept study to assess efficacy  safety  and tolerability in addition to standard of care (SOC)  compared to SOC alone  in adult patients with ACLF grades 1 and 2 and ascites. NTZ (anti-bacterial agent with anti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective effects).SRT-015 (injectable formulation): an ASK1 inhibitor with multi-system benefits.CLM-022 (NLRP3 inflammasome inhibitor aimed at inhibiting systemic inflammation and cell death).VS-02-HE (small molecule aiming at reducing hyperammonemia  stabilizing blood ammonia and preventing hepatic encephalopathy).Diagnostics: publications in leading scientific journals2023 was a successful year for NIS2+® with several papers published in leading scientific journals such as the Journal of Hepatology  Journal of Hepatology Reports and Hepatology Communications  which all recognized the performance and precision of GENFIT’s diagnostic technology.ESG achievements: recognition by independent bodiesEthifinance upgraded GENFIT’s ESG performance level from bronze to gold and accorded GENFIT a two out of 75 biopharmaceutical sector ranking. Furthermore  GENFIT was classified by ODDO Research as ""Best-in-Class"" in its sector  based on two main criteria: activity impact and ESG maturity. GENFIT equally obtained a “Prime status” label by ISS ESG  upgrading its corporate rating from C to C+.Corporate governance updatesAt the Company’s Annual Shareholders’ Meeting held on May 24  2023  all of the resolutions endorsed by the Board of Directors were adopted by a significant majority of the votes cast. This includes the renewal of financial authorizations. In June 2023  Sandra Silvestri  M.D.  Ph.D.  replaced Steven Hildemann M.D.  Ph.D.  on the Board of Directors of the Company as representative of Ipsen  the legal entity that holds the board seat. In the first half of 2023  Sakina Sayah Jeanne and Tom Huijbers joined GENFIT’s Executive Committee as Executive Vice-President Research & Translational Science and Executive Vice-President Regulatory  respectively.II. Outlook 2024PBC: major catalyst with potential to trigger a new revenue streamRegulatory filing acceptance has been obtained in the US  Europe and the United Kingdom and a Priority Review has been granted for an NDA by the FDA for elafibranor in PBC with a PDUFA target action date of June 10  2024.Execution of R&D roadmapIn 2024  GENFIT will prioritize the execution of its clinical development programs  as well as research programs focused on pre-clinical/non-clinical development.ACLF: key milestonesGENFIT will also continue its efforts to further strengthen its position as scientific leader in the field of ACLF. GENFIT’s R&D efforts have pivoted from chronic to acute liver diseases  with a strong focus on ACLF where the unmet medical need is very important and for which there are currently no approved therapies. Our therapeutic candidates have been strategically selected based on the pathophysiology of ACLF to address the most relevant pathways via differentiated and complementary modes of action.VS-01-ACLF: Phase 2 initiated with interim data readout targeted for 2H24NTZ in ACLF: reformulation and Phase 2 under preparation in 2024 with a proof-of-concept study initiation targeted for 1H25SRT-015: First-in-Human study initiation targeted 1Q25CLM-022: preclinical Proof of Concept expected to be obtained by end of 2024VS-02-HE: IND enabling studies starting in 2024 with completion expected in 2025Other life-threatening diseases franchise: key milestonesGNS561 in cholangiocarcinoma (CCA)The GNS561 Phase 1b/2a clinical trial is currently ongoing and preliminary data from Phase 1b is targeted by the end of 2024.VS-01-HACFollowing completion of the non-clinical feasibility study  we plan to develop formulation optimization for specific pediatric implementation and conduct IND enabling nonclinical studies with a target to complete such studies in 2024.Diagnostics franchiseNIS2+®: first-ever approved drug for MASH could lead to an increased need for a non-invasive testOn March 14  2024  Madrigal Pharmaceuticals announced FDA approval of Rezdiffra™ (resmetirom) in conjunction with diet and exercise for the treatment of adults with non-cirrhotic MASH with moderate to advanced liver fibrosis. Rezdiffra™ is thus the first-ever approved drug for the treatment of MASH  which should increase the focus on diagnosis over the coming years.Our aim is to pursue our scientific publication plan  particularly focusing on the capabilities of NIS2+® as a potential tool to monitor a patient’s response to treatment  and also to move forward with the development of an IVD version of the test  either in collaboration with a commercial partner or by ourselves  in order to make NIS2+® accessible to as many patients as possible worldwide.TS-01: in development for measuring blood ammonia levelsThe development of TS-01  a device based on the polymersome technology  is being carried out in collaboration with ZHAW School of Engineering and intends to measure ammonia in the blood. The next steps include validation of the test in blood and further miniaturization of the device.III.

This increase is due to a one-time cancellation of €3.2 million refundable government grant from Bpifrance (the BPI France IT-DIAB) as part of a framework innovation aid agreement involving several scientific partners and for which GENFIT was the lead partner. The program related to this cancellation ended in 2014.Operating results and expensesOperating expenses for 2023 amounted to €64.8 million compared to €53.9 million for 2022. This is comprised of research and development expenses  general and administrative expenses  marketing and market access expenses  reorganization and restructuring expenses  and other operating expenses.The increase is due to multiple factors:An increase in research and development costs of €10.7 million  explained by the increase in costs related to new programs and product candidates  in particular VS-01 and GNS561  offset by a reduction in study costs related to NTZ.An increase in general and administrative expenses of €1.3 million  explained by increased headcount.A decrease in marketing and market access expenses of €0.1 million.A decrease in reorganization and restructuring charges of €0.5 million  consisting of unused office space provision reversals as the RESOLVE-IT ® study is complete.study is complete.

This is based on current assumptions and programs  and does not include exceptional events. This estimation includes our expectations to receive future milestone revenue in 2024  subject to approval by applicable regulatory authorities and US and European commercial launches of elafibranor in PBC  representing a total of approximately €75.2 million.Consolidated Statement of Operations*Year ended (in € thousands  except earnings per share data) 31/12/2022 31/12/2023 Revenues and other income Revenue 20 195 28 565 Other income 6 371 9 610 Revenues and other income 26 566 38 176 Operating expenses and other operating income (expenses) Research and development expenses (35 818) (46 503) General and administrative expenses (16 405) (17 741) Marketing and market access expenses (992) (876) Reorganization and restructuring income (expenses) 11 505 Other operating expenses (652) (141) Operating income (loss) (27 289) (26 580) Financial income 8 212 3 680 Financial expenses (4 758) (5 614) Financial profit (loss) 3 453 (1 934) Net profit (loss) before tax (23 836) (28 514) Income tax benefit (expense) 116 (380) Net profit (loss) (23 719) (28 894) Basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share Basic earnings (loss) per share (€/share) (0.48) (0.58) Diluted earnings (loss) per share (€/share) (0.48) (0.58)(*) Audit procedures on the Consolidated Financial Statements have been substantially completed.

This is Fermentalg's best sales quarter since the beginning of 2022  confirming its new sales momentum after the 2023 slump.As announced at the start of the year  this performance is the fruit of the company's new sales policy  aimed both at winning over new customers  particularly in market segments that had previously been little or not prospected at all  and at establishing long-term contractual relationships with these customers  to ensure greater visibility and recurrent sales.In the 1st quarter 2024  half of all invoiced customers were new  with first deliveries in the animal feed segment. Fermentalg has noted an upturn in business in North America  which accounted for two-thirds of sales in the first quarter. 80% of sales are generated by framework contracts  providing visibility over 12 to 24 months....and an enhanced commercial offering...Since the beginning of the year  Fermentalg has also pursued its development efforts to broaden its product offering. These efforts should enable the Company to provide the products and solutions best suited to customer demand  and to continue signing long-term supply contracts with these customers....to confirm financial targetsAt the end of March  Fermentalg had already secured more than €10 million in orders and contracts for 2024  enabling it to be slightly ahead of schedule and secure its sales target of €10 million for the full year.The Company will shortly be reporting on its new industrial and commercial advances  linked in particular to the strategic partnership with the HuvePharma group  which support growth ambitions to reach over €25 million in sales by 2026.Next publication: 1er half-year sales 2024 July 4  2024 (after market close)About FermentalgAn expert in the research and bioindustrial exploitation of microalgae  Fermentalg aims to offer sustainable solutions and innovative products that contribute to the development of healthy  natural and high-performance products.

In addition to the economic slowdown affecting consumption  particularly in the nutraceuticals segment  Fermentalg was penalized by two major customers who significantly reduced or completely cancelled their purchases.This context explains the increase in inventories during the year  which led the Company to write down part of them  with an accounting impact of -2.0 M€ for the year. The net inventory of €6.8 million is due to be sold in 2024  with the resumption of commercial activity.At the same time  the gradual increase in industrial productivity during the year offset the continued high level of energy and glucose prices. Total R&D costs fell by 28% to €5.6 million in 2023  reflecting the completion of industrialization of the acid-stable blue pigment of natural origin. After taking into account capitalized costs and amortization  the net expense amounted to €4.4 million  or 8% less than in 2022.Operating income for the year  before share-based payments and non-recurring items  came to -10.9 M€  compared with -8.7 M€ a year earlier. After non-recurring items (transfer of industrial production to new partner HuveNutra and depreciation of obsolete equipment)  operating income came to -11.8 M€  and to -9.8 M€ excluding inventory write-downs  compared with -9.0 M€ for FY 2022.Financial expenses were heavily impacted by the calculation of the fair value under IFRS of the convertible bonds issued in 2023 (accounting impact of -1.2 M€ with no cash impact)  against a backdrop of volatile share prices. After taking into account the Group's share in the earnings of CarbonWorks  a subsidiary dedicated to the development of CO 2 circular economy solutions  whose operational ramp-up is weighing on results in the short term (€ -0.9 million versus € -0.5 million a year earlier)  net income came to € -14.1 million (versus € -9.9 million in 2022).Analysis of financial structure(in K€) 21/12/2022 21/12/2023 Shareholders' equity 41 980 30 846 Non-current borrowings 10 187 13 973 Current borrowings 831 1 381 Cash and cash equivalents 15 902 11 162As of December 31  2023  Fermentalg had gross cash of €11.2 million (€15.9 million at end 2022) and shareholders' equity of €30.8 million.The €6.3 million bond issue in March 2023 covered a large part of the company's needs in terms of operations (-€8.7 million) and capital expenditure (-€1.8 million)  mainly in R&D.Financial debt  amounting to €15.4m gross at year-end compared with €11.0m a year earlier  consists of repayable advances (€6.4m)  the convertible bond held by the Givaudan group (€3.6m) and  for the balance  the portion of the above-mentioned bonds not yet converted into shares (€4.6m).At present  the Company estimates that it has a liquidity horizon until the middle of the 2nd quarter 2025.OutlookAfter managing this transitional 2023 financial year  and buoyed by a good start to 2024  Fermentalg is approaching the coming months with confidence  confirming its sales ambitions of €10 million in 2024 and over €25 million in sales by 2026.Next publication: 1st half-year sales 2024 July 4  2024 (after market close)About FermentalgAn expert in the research and bioindustrial exploitation of microalgae  Fermentalg aims to offer sustainable solutions and innovative products that contribute to the development of healthy  natural and high-performance products.

Existing clearing regulations further enhance the ubiquity of the CME platform.Among groups owning financial markets that are themselves listed on stock exchanges - such as the London Stock Exchange  Deutsche Borse  Euronext or Nasdaq - CME achieves by far the best margins.Annual sales growth averaged 5.6% over the previous decade  while earnings per share doubled as the famous ""network effect"" took hold  averaging 7% annual growth.What's more  last year CME guaranteed a dividend yield of 5% via its variable payout policy. It is notable - and surprising given current trends - that the Group has never been inclined towards share buy-backs  no doubt believing its shares to be well valued.Outside of periods of panic  the average valuation multiple has remained remarkably stable over the past ten years  anchored at around x26 earnings.

(""AMG""  EURONEXT AMSTERDAM: ""AMG"") is pleased to announce the formation of NewMOX SAS  Grenoble  France  to service the nuclear fuel market. NewMOX is a subsidiary of ALD Vacuum Technologies GmbH  Hanau …","Amsterdam  4 April 2024 --- AMG Critical Materials N.V. (""AMG""  EURONEXT AMSTERDAM: ""AMG"") is pleased to announce the formation of NewMOX SAS  Grenoble  France  to service the nuclear fuel market. NewMOX is a subsidiary of ALD Vacuum Technologies GmbH  Hanau  Germany (""ALD"")  AMG’s engineering subsidiary focused on vacuum furnace technology  which includes sintering furnace systems enabling the production of commercial nuclear fuel from plutonium and depleted uranium (termed “MOX”). ALD's MOX technology has been applied in Germany  the United States  France  Belgium  the United Kingdom and recently ALD has been delivering such furnace systems to China. ALD – where D stands for Degussa – inherited the MOX technology from Degussa AG  ALD’s former owner (later renamed Evonik AG).Presently  the total global storage of civil-use plutonium resulting from the reprocessing of used fuel from commercial nuclear power operations stands at 380 tons  and this figure continues to grow with ongoing nuclear power generation. Furthermore  if turned into electricity  this plutonium could power 36 one-gigawatt nuclear power plants for 20 years. Recycling this plutonium would result in “CO 2 free” power and a saving of over 2 billion tons of CO 2 if measured against a coal dominated grid. It should also be noted that the circularity associated with the conversion of plutonium into MOX reduces uranium mining and therefore further increases the attractiveness of nuclear power in CO 2 terms.The storage of plutonium is extremely costly due to the risks associated with plutonium. The conversion of plutonium into MOX fuel not only eliminates these risks but can be a commercially attractive alternative to storage. As an indicator  the conversion of 380 tons of plutonium into MOX translates at present fuel prices into a commercial value of $15 to $20 billion.“We are excited that our furnace technology engineering excellence has created a new project which resulted in the formation of NewMOX SAS. We have appointed Serge Bertrand  head of ALD France  Grenoble  where ALD has centered its nuclear technology activities  to be CEO of NewMOX. Dr. Johannes Fachinger  head of nuclear ALD Hanau  will be Chief Technology Officer. Both gentlemen have extensive industry expertise  and most recently were in charge of implementing the MOX furnace technology in a Chinese factory ” said Michael Hohmann  ALD’s CEO.“The NewMOX business model is simple ” said Dr. Heinz Schimmelbusch  AMG’s CEO. “There is a lot of plutonium stored and the operators of these storage facilities are seeking ways to reduce storage costs; there is the proven ALD MOX sinter furnace technology; and there is a large MOX market which will grow with the development of the emerging SMR (Small Modular Reactor) wave. It is the objective of NewMOX to form partnerships for the construction and operation of a commercial plutonium recycling facility producing MOX fuel starting with conceptual engineering and feasibility studies. This will take time  but this is a very valuable destination. And it qualifies under AMG’s “Double Materiality” standard which combines financial and environmental benefits.”The declaration by the Dubai 23 conference COP 28 on Climate Change that the tripling of the world's nuclear energy is essential for defeating Climate Change has opened a new and prospective page for the nuclear industry. This statement has been strengthened during the European Nuclear Summit in March 2024 in Brussels  where leaders of European countries and energy experts called for a “nuclear energy revival.”For more information on AMG’s engineering subsidiary  visit their website at ald-vt.com.About AMGAMG's mission is to provide critical materials and related process technologies to advance a less carbon-intensive world.

This entails adopting a One Stop Shop approach led by Phast and implementing a ""One Brand  One Market"" strategy to enhance each brand's market leadership.

The cons…,"Bordeaux (France)  4 April 2024 - Hydrogène de France (HDF Energy)  a developer of large-scale hydrogen infrastructure and manufacturer of high-power fuel cells  presents its business activity and financial statements for the 2023 financial year. The consolidated financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors on 3 April 2024. The audit procedures on the consolidated financial statements have been completed and the auditors' report will be issued shortly.Key figures 2023 2022 Number of projects under development 25 13 Total investment budget (USD bn) 5.5 1.8 Annual average headcount1 89 57 Revenues (€000) 3 935 3 462 Gains on disposal of securities2 (€000) - 1 041 Consolidated net income/(loss) (€000) (7 839) (3 371) Shareholders' equity (€000) 100 695 107 410 Cash and cash equivalents (€000) 62 668 87 359Employees and contractors in countries where the Company has no dedicated legal entity Sale of shares to investors in SPVsExpansion and major progress in the project portfolioThe commercial rollout and development of projects across all the regions in which we operate remained a priority in 2023. International financing institutions have deemed these projects technically reliable and economically relevant solutions: our project in Barbados is the first to secure financing from the World Bank and the Green Climate Fund (GCF).As such  despite an adverse economic environment and the increasing complexity of development stages  significant progress was made in 2023 on a number of projects on which construction now looks likely to begin in 2024/2025  notably in Namibia  Mexico and Indonesia.Portfolio monitoring provides the earliest indicator of HDF's value creation for both the Group and all project stakeholders. HDF estimates that it is able to generate revenues representing between 12% and 17% of the cost of construction during the development and construction phases  including via the provision of engineering services and supply of fuel cells during the power plant construction phase.Stable revenuesConsolidated revenues for 2023 amounted to €3.9 million (compared to €3.5 million in 2022)  including €3.2 million in project management assistance  excluding re-invoicing  without margins  for services outsourced to external service providers. It mainly comprises development work on the RSB project in Barbados (€2.9 million  compared to €3.0 million in 2022) and the Newgen project in Trinidad and Tobago (€0.8 million  compared to zero in 2022).For the 2023 financial year  the development services provided by HDF on projects in which the Group remains the majority shareholder  the impact of which is eliminated in the consolidated financial statements  amounted to €1.1 million (compared to €3.0 million in 2022). These projects will contribute to the Group's consolidated revenue once shares are sold to investors and control of the SPV is lost. At that date  the value creation initially eliminated in the consolidated financial statements will be recognised through gains or losses on disposal of the investments.Significant investments in line with the strategic planThe increase in operating expenses reflects the successful implementation of the Group's development plan.For HDF  human capital remains the primary investment target for the future. The Group therefore continued to strengthen its teams in 2023. Average headcount (employees and contractors) rose from 57 in 2022 to 89 in 2023  mainly due to the doubling of the technical workforce dedicated to projects and the industrial programme.As a result  personnel costs increased from €4.3 million in 2022 to €6.9 million in 2023.Sales momentum and prospecting activity also impacted feasibility study costs and fees  thus explaining the increase in external expenses from €3.7 million to €5.9 million.Lastly  net income for the year included a €1.5 million impairment charge on intangible assets due to delays in the project schedule.Consequently  the Group posted a €7.8 million net loss for the year  compared to a €3.4 million loss in 2022.Meanwhile  the Group invested €16 million of its financial resources on preparations for the rollout of its programmes. This overall investment breaks down as follows:€12 million for the construction of the Blanquefort plant  where HDF will manufacture the first high-power fuel cells from 2025;€1 million for strategic partnerships in the marine propulsion and rail traction sectors (investments in Digas and Hynaval) to support the industrial programme;€2 million of investments related to progress in the project portfolio.Investments in real estate and intangible assets directly impacted the Group's cash position  which nevertheless remained extremely strong at €62.7 million at 31 December 2023 (compared to €87.4 million at 31 December 2022).A promising courseAfter two years of rollout  the Company now boasts the human  material and financial resources required to fulfil its ambitions. The maturity of the project portfolio and launch of industrial operations make it possible to envisage tangible results from 2024 onwards.Damien Havard  Chairman and CEO of Hydrogène de France  said: “Our achievements in 2023 perfectly reflect HDF's twofold ambition: to implement projects that contribute directly to energy decarbonisation while becoming a major industrial player. Our presence across five continents  the expertise of our technical teams and our industrial investment all strengthen the application of our know-how across the entire hydrogen value chain. HDF's teams are fully committed to solidifying our ambitions from 2024 onwards.”ABOUT HYDROGÈNE DE FRANCE (HDF Energy)HDF Energy is a leading global player in the hydrogen industry  dedicated to developing large-scale hydrogen infrastructure and advanced multi-megawatt fuel cell technology.These fuel cells generate electricity from hydrogen  driving the decarbonization efforts across the power generation  heavy maritime and rail mobility sectors.

NewMOX is a subsidiary of ALD Vacuum Technologies GmbH  Hanau  Germany   AMG…,"Amsterdam  4 April 2024 --- AMG Critical Materials N.V. (""AMG""  EURONEXT AMSTERDAM: ""AMG"") is pleased to announce the formation of NewMOX SAS  Grenoble  France  to service the nuclear fuel market. NewMOX is a subsidiary of ALD Vacuum Technologies GmbH  Hanau  Germany (""ALD"")  AMG’s engineering subsidiary focused on vacuum furnace technology  which includes sintering furnace systems enabling the production of commercial nuclear fuel from plutonium and depleted uranium (termed “MOX”). ALD's MOX technology has been applied in Germany  the United States  France  Belgium  the United Kingdom and recently ALD has been delivering such furnace systems to China. ALD – where D stands for Degussa – inherited the MOX technology from Degussa AG  ALD’s former owner (later renamed Evonik AG).Presently  the total global storage of civil-use plutonium resulting from the reprocessing of used fuel from commercial nuclear power operations stands at 380 tons  and this figure continues to grow with ongoing nuclear power generation. Furthermore  if turned into electricity  this plutonium could power 36 one-gigawatt nuclear power plants for 20 years. Recycling this plutonium would result in “CO 2 free” power and a saving of over 2 billion tons of CO 2 if measured against a coal dominated grid. It should also be noted that the circularity associated with the conversion of plutonium into MOX reduces uranium mining and therefore further increases the attractiveness of nuclear power in CO 2 terms.The storage of plutonium is extremely costly due to the risks associated with plutonium. The conversion of plutonium into MOX fuel not only eliminates these risks but can be a commercially attractive alternative to storage. As an indicator  the conversion of 380 tons of plutonium into MOX translates at present fuel prices into a commercial value of $15 to $20 billion.“We are excited that our furnace technology engineering excellence has created a new project which resulted in the formation of NewMOX SAS. We have appointed Serge Bertrand  head of ALD France  Grenoble  where ALD has centered its nuclear technology activities  to be CEO of NewMOX. Dr. Johannes Fachinger  head of nuclear ALD Hanau  will be Chief Technology Officer. Both gentlemen have extensive industry expertise  and most recently were in charge of implementing the MOX furnace technology in a Chinese factory ” said Michael Hohmann  ALD’s CEO.“The NewMOX business model is simple ” said Dr. Heinz Schimmelbusch  AMG’s CEO. “There is a lot of plutonium stored and the operators of these storage facilities are seeking ways to reduce storage costs; there is the proven ALD MOX sinter furnace technology; and there is a large MOX market which will grow with the development of the emerging SMR (Small Modular Reactor) wave. It is the objective of NewMOX to form partnerships for the construction and operation of a commercial plutonium recycling facility producing MOX fuel starting with conceptual engineering and feasibility studies. This will take time  but this is a very valuable destination. And it qualifies under AMG’s “Double Materiality” standard which combines financial and environmental benefits.”The declaration by the Dubai 23 conference COP 28 on Climate Change that the tripling of the world's nuclear energy is essential for defeating Climate Change has opened a new and prospective page for the nuclear industry. This statement has been strengthened during the European Nuclear Summit in March 2024 in Brussels  where leaders of European countries and energy experts called for a “nuclear energy revival.”For more information on AMG’s engineering subsidiary  visit their website at ald-vt.com.About AMGAMG's mission is to provide critical materials and related process technologies to advance a less carbon-intensive world. To this end  AMG is focused on the production and development of energy storage materials such as lithium  vanadium  and tantalum.

Lacking major masterpieces since the sale of the Paul G. Allen Collection in 2022  the major auction houses have focused on offering a greater volume of works  including works that are more accessible  more recent or  which return to auction more quickly. But  even during this shift in focus  the popularity of blue-chip artists has continued to increase.“Artprice's latest annual report  “The Art Market in 2023” underscores the shift from a sellers' market to a buyers' market in 2023  explains thierry Ehrmann  CEO and Founder of Artmarket.com and its Artprice department. “During such periods  the balance of power tends to switch from the sellers to the buyers with the latter now being able to afford to be more demanding. But this shift has the effect of slowing the high-end segment  by reducing the availability of works likely to fetch over a million dollars. However  even in these circumstances  Artprice recorded a slight increase in prices for works by Blue-Chips artists.Artprice100© vs. S&P 500 and STOXX Europe 50 – Base 100 in January 2000[ https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2024/04/image1-artprice100-vs-sandp500-vs-stoxx-europe-50.png ]Calculation principle of the Artprice100©On 1 January 2023  Artprice updated its portfolio respecting the same investment strategy as in previous years. This consists of maintaining fictitious stakes in the world's 100 top-selling artists on the secondary market  with the stakes adjusted annually based on the artists' annual auction turnover and the market liquidity of their works over the previous 5-year period. The relative weight of each artist in the portfolio at the start of every year is therefore proportional to the relative turnover their works have generated over the previous five years  and this figure is then adjusted by a market liquidity factor. The exact breakdown of the portfolio as of 1 January 2023 is provided below in the section Composition of Artprice100© as of 1 January 2023.On 31 December 2023  Artprice noted the theoretical change in value for each of the 100 artists in the portfolio based on the evolution of their respective price indices over the previous year. These indices are calculated by Artprice on all auction results recorded during the year 2023  for all categories of Fine Art works  with the exception of Prints and Multiples which constitute a separate market.For example  investment in works by Gerhard Richter (1932) represented 2.8% of the Artprice100© portfolio on 1 January 2023  and his price index increased by +21% over the following twelve months. The investment in works by Jean-Michel Basquiat (1960-1988) represented 3.9% of the portfolio at the start of 2023  but his price index fell by -15% in 2023.But  despite the heaviest-weighted artists recording price contractions in 2023 (particularly Pablo Picasso  Andy Warhol  and Claude Monet who between them accounted for almost a fifth of the portfolio) the Artprice100© portfolio  which is highly diversified  ended the year in positive territory. So  at the end of 2023  the overall ROI for the 100 artists in the Artprice100© was +1.55%.Composition of the Artprice100© Index as of 1 January 2023[ https://imgpublic.artprice.com/img/wp/sites/11/2024/04/image2-artprice100-composition-2023.jpg ]Due to the rarity of works by Old Masters  they are now practically absent from the composition of the Artprice100© portfolio. Only the great Chinese master Dong Qichang (1555-1636) was included at the start of 2023 with a 0.3% theoretical investment.The share of 19th-Century artists has increased significantly. The spectacular results recorded in 2022 for Vincent van Gogh (1853-1890) and Paul Cézanne (1839-1906) during the sale of the Paul G. Allen Collection significantly raised their participation when the portfolio was adjusted at the start of the following year (2023). In total  19th Century artists represented 12% of the portfolio at the start of 2023  compared with 10% at the beginning of 2022.Weight of the five major creative periods in the Artprice100© in 2023Modern Art remained the largest segment in the composition of the Artprice100© index  accounting for 43% of the initial 2023 investment. The Belgian Surrealist René Magritte (1898-1967) and the Chinese master Qi Baishi (1864-1957) have both been included in the composition of the Artprice100© for around ten years  but the dynamics of their respective markets are currently following very different paths: while the prices of works by René Magritte are increasing quickly (+38%)  Qi Baishi's prices recorded a contraction of around -22% in 2023.This year  the Post-War Art period accounted for 5 of the top 10 artists in the Artprice100© Index. Among them  the weight of the Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama (b.1929) in the portfolio is continuing to grow  driven by tremendous global success. With 812 lots sold at auction in 2023 for a total of $193 million  Yayoi Kusama is currently the 8th top-selling artist on the global art auction market (all creative periods combined) and the world's most in-demand female artist. In 2023  Gerhard Richter was the only living artist whose auction turnover was higher than Kusama's.Lastly  in our 2023 Artprice100© portfolio  Contemporary Art represented 13% of the initial investment. The youngest artist in the portfolio was the Romanian painter Adrian Ghenie (b.1977)  represented by the Plan-B  Thaddaeus Ropac  Tim Van Laere  and Pace galleries.Composition of Artprice100©: Artist and weight in the initial Artprice100© portfolio for 20231.

""Simultaneously  we are actively working on refining the design of the RECOVER PIII study  in order to both fulfil regulatory requirements and support marketing authorization in both the United States and Europe.Cash position as of March 31  2024GenSight Biologics' cash and cash equivalents totalled €2.2 million as of March 31  2024  compared to €2.1 million as of December 31  2023.The Company completed a successful offering in February 2024 for a total gross amount of €5 million and has continued to work on cash preservation measures  notably additional savings and obtaining waivers from existing creditors1.The Company does not have sufficient net working capital to meet its obligations over the next 12 months but only until end of April 2024.The Company is currently engaged in active discussions to secure financing for its activities from the end of April 2024 to Q3 2024  when the early access program in France (AAC - autorisation d'accÃ¨s compassionnel  formerly known as ATU - autorisation temporaire d'utilisation) is expected to resume. Once the AAC/AAP program resumes  the Company estimates that the cash runway would be extended to the end of Q1 2025.The net funding requirement for the next 12 months is estimated at €9 million (including the anticipated income from the resumption of the AAC/AAP program in France in Q3 2024)  in view of the Company's need to finance its ongoing activities.In parallel  the Company is also advancing on a number of discussions with potential partners on strategic opportunities  including a possible merger  acquisition or licensing deal  assessed as one of the relevant options to move forward.Business updateGenSight successfully manufactured two Drug Substance (DS) batches of LUMEVOQ ® meeting Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) standards in September and November 2023. To optimize vial availability for patients  the decision was made to mix these batches into one Drug Product (DP) batch  slated for release and inclusion in the EAP resumption in Q3 2024. In January 2024  GenSight received constructive feedback from the FDA regarding the design of the Phase III trial RECOVER  which had been previously shared with EMA (European Medicine Agency) and UK's MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency).The Company is currently refining the RECOVER study design to incorporate feedback from regulatory agencies prior to the launch of the study  in order to both fulfil regulatory requirements and then support both US and EU regulatory submissions for registration. Additional consultations with regulatory agencies may be necessary to finalize the study design.RECOVER will be able to begin recruiting once the design is finalized; the product is released for human use; and approval is obtained from local competent authorities and ethics committees. With the Company prioritizing the allocation of the next available LUMEVOQ ® vials to supply of the AAP/AAC program and considering the need of refining the RECOVER study design  the inclusion of the first patient in the trial is expected in H2 2025. The duration of the trial will depend on its final design currently being determined.As previously announced  the existing clinical data package  not necessarily including the upcoming RECOVER trial data  could support a marketing authorization application in the UK. The Company plans further discussions with the MHRA to ensure the quickest path towards a regulatory submission.Starting Q3 2024  the Company expects to provide treatment to patients in France through the AAC program.Number of outstanding sharesAs of March 31  2024  GenSight Biologics' number of outstanding shares was 78 370 724 ordinary shares.Detailed information regarding the Company  including its business  financial information  results  perspectives and related risk factors are contained (i) in the Company's 2022 Universal Registration Document filed with the AMF on May 10  2023 under number D.23-0406 (the ""2022 URD"")  and (ii) the amendment to the 2022 URD filed with the AMF on November 21  2023 under number D.23-0406-A01 (the ""Amendment to the 2022 URD"").

(TSXV: PPP) (""Prospector"") through which Prospector will acquire a 100% interest in the Savant Gold Project in Ontario  Canada. Prospector has been exploring the Savant Gold Project through an Earn-In Agreement announced in September  2020  and has defined a number of high-grade gold targets from work conducted within both the extensive Iron Formation sequences (e.g. the Snowbird  Horseshoe targets) and the Wiggle Deformation Zone (see Company News Release dated June 28  2022).Terms of the Property Acquisition AgreementProspector will acquire a 100% interest in the Savant Gold Project from Capella in accordance with the following terms:Prospector to make a cash payment to Capella of CAD 50 000 on closing; Prospector to issue Capella 1 000 000 common shares (with a standard regulatory hold period of 4 months) upon closing; and  Capella to retain a 1% Net Smelter Royalty (""NSR"") on any potential future production from the property (with 0.5% being purchasable at any time for CAD 1 000 000 ).The Property Acquisition Agreement replaces the existing Earn-In Agreement in its entirety  and closing will be subject to TSX Venture Exchange (and other regulatory) approvals being obtained.Eric Roth  Capella's President and CEO  commented: ""The sale of the Savant Gold Project to our Joint Venture partner Prospector is consistent with our flagged strategy of exiting our precious metals projects in the Americas and focusing on our Scandinavian copper  gold  and battery metal projects. Ultimately  the successful sale of our assets in Canada and Argentina will lead to Capella having a more streamlined portfolio and a more clearly-defined strategy going forward.Whilst we have relinquished our direct interest in the Savant Gold Project  we strongly believe in the potential for new high-grade gold discoveries on the property and Capella shareholders will retain upside to all future exploration success through both the Prospector shareholding and the NSR from potential future production. I also look forward to keeping the market updated on our divestiture efforts at our Sierra Blanca (Argentina) and Domain (Manitoba) projects"".Qualified Persons and Disclosure StatementThe technical information in this news release relating to the Savant Gold Project has been prepared in accordance with Canadian regulatory requirements set out in NI 43-101  and approved by Eric Roth  the Company's President & CEO  a Director  and a Qualified Person under NI 43-101.

""Simultaneously  we are actively working on refining the design of the RECOVER PIII study  in order to both fulfil regulatory requirements and support marketing authorization in both the United States and Europe.”Cash position as of March 31  2024GenSight Biologics’ cash and cash equivalents totalled €2.2 million as of March 31  2024  compared to €2.1 million as of December 31  2023.The Company completed a successful offering in February 2024 for a total gross amount of €5 million and has continued to work on cash preservation measures  notably additional savings and obtaining waivers from existing creditors1.The Company does not have sufficient net working capital to meet its obligations over the next 12 months but only until end of April 2024.The Company is currently engaged in active discussions to secure financing for its activities from the end of April 2024 to Q3 2024  when the early access program in France (AAC - autorisation d’accès compassionnel  formerly known as ATU - autorisation temporaire d’utilisation) is expected to resume. Once the AAC/AAP program resumes  the Company estimates that the cash runway would be extended to the end of Q1 2025.The net funding requirement for the next 12 months is estimated at €9 million (including the anticipated income from the resumption of the AAC/AAP program in France in Q3 2024)  in view of the Company's need to finance its ongoing activities.In parallel  the Company is also advancing on a number of discussions with potential partners on strategic opportunities  including a possible merger  acquisition or licensing deal  assessed as one of the relevant options to move forward.Business updateGenSight successfully manufactured two Drug Substance (DS) batches of LUMEVOQ® meeting Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) standards in September and November 2023. To optimize vial availability for patients  the decision was made to mix these batches into one Drug Product (DP) batch  slated for release and inclusion in the EAP resumption in Q3 2024. In January 2024  GenSight received constructive feedback from the FDA regarding the design of the Phase III trial RECOVER  which had been previously shared with EMA (European Medicine Agency) and UK’s MHRA (Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency).The Company is currently refining the RECOVER study design to incorporate feedback from regulatory agencies prior to the launch of the study  in order to both fulfil regulatory requirements and then support both US and EU regulatory submissions for registration. Additional consultations with regulatory agencies may be necessary to finalize the study design.RECOVER will be able to begin recruiting once the design is finalized; the product is released for human use; and approval is obtained from local competent authorities and ethics committees. With the Company prioritizing the allocation of the next available LUMEVOQ® vials to supply of the AAP/AAC program and considering the need of refining the RECOVER study design  the inclusion of the first patient in the trial is expected in H2 2025. The duration of the trial will depend on its final design currently being determined.As previously announced  the existing clinical data package  not necessarily including the upcoming RECOVER trial data  could support a marketing authorization application in the UK. The Company plans further discussions with the MHRA to ensure the quickest path towards a regulatory submission.Starting Q3 2024  the Company expects to provide treatment to patients in France through the AAC program.Number of outstanding sharesAs of March 31  2024  GenSight Biologics’ number of outstanding shares was 78 370 724 ordinary shares.Detailed information regarding the Company  including its business  financial information  results  perspectives and related risk factors are contained (i) in the Company’s 2022 Universal Registration Document filed with the AMF on May 10  2023 under number D.23-0406 (the ""2022 URD"")  and (ii) the amendment to the 2022 URD filed with the AMF on November 21  2023 under number D.23-0406-A01 (the ""Amendment to the 2022 URD"").

Deletion following sentence: ""In accordance with the Dutch Corporate Governance Code  all shares in the Company held by the Non-Executive Board Members shall be a long-term investment."" This change is proposed to be made to avoid that the shares awarded to the Non- Executive Directors  as part of their fixed annual remuneration  are deemed linked to the performance of Pharming and  therefore  to safeguard their independence. This change will result in a deviation from best practice provision 3.3.3 of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code that recommends that shares held by a supervisory board member (or non-executive board member) in the company on whose supervisory board (or boardof directors) they serve should be long-term investments only.
