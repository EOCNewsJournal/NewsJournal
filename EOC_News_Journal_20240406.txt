A unique selling point is the possibility of refuelling the integrated tanks of the H 2 Genset at hydrogen filling stations. The successful CE certification proves the conformity of the product with the applicable European directives and standards and thus paves the way for a broad market entry of the H 2 Genset in Europe.Only in April 2022  SFC Energy  TEST-FUCHS and Auto AG Group signed a cooperation partnership for the joint development of the H 2 Genset. Accordingly  it took just 24 months from the initial idea to serial production readiness. The trailer-mounted power generator produces reliable and emission-free energy and is designed for 10 kW nominal and 28 kW peak output.Thanks to its mobile design  the H 2 Genset enables flexible and time-saving use at any location with no conventional power grid or where an interruption-free power supply must be ensured. Applications include for example outdoor festivals  events  construction sites and the protection of critical infrastructures against power failures. So far  diesel generators are often used to secure the power supply  but their noise and harmful emissions are a burden on people and the environment. The H 2 Genset not only represents an emission-free alternative  but also enables users to sustainably reduce their carbon footprint and significantly contribute to environmental protection. With these advantages of mobile and emission-free energy generation  the H 2 Genset has already been awarded the Karl Ritter von Ghega-Prize Innovation Prize by the state of Lower Austria.Dr. Peter Podesser  CEO of SFC Energy AG: “Just within a few months and together with our partners TEST-FUCHS GmbH and Auto AG Group  we developed a mobile power solution ready for serial production that has never existed in this form before. This partnership demonstrates how quickly things can happen and shows what is possible when several companies pull together to develop an ecological and clean energy source. With its emission-free hydrogen technology  the H 2 Genset can be used wherever a self-sufficient power supply is required and fossil energy generators have been used until now.""Volker Fuchs  CEO of TEST-FUCHS GmbH: “Together  all project partners have set a milestone in the research and development of this mobile power supply. Without question  the H 2 Genset sets new standards in the flexible use of hydrogen for power generation. It enables users who previously relied on conventional fossil energy sources for their mobile power supplies to significantly reduce their carbon footprint. We are convinced that the H 2 Genset has great market potential.""Marc Ziegler  CEO of Auto AG Group: “The H 2 Genset is the result of three innovative partners bundling their know-how. With it  we are opening a new chapter in emission-free  mobile electricity production and that makes us very proud. Thanks to its technological features  the H 2 Genset offers numerous advantages  regardless of its intended use and whether its operation requires continuous or peak power. For us  it is certain that  with its hydrogen technology  the H 2 Genset will be an important element of an off-grid  climate-neutral energy supply in the future.""For further information on the H₂Genset at h2-genset.com  autoag.ch and test-fuchs.com.

These results were confirmed by a post-hoc analysis of brain imaging at 0 and 24 hours using artificial intelligence (Brainomix  UK). This independent analysis confirmed the reduction in the number and volume of intracerebral lesions in patients treated with glenzocimab. The efficacy of glenzocimab is now being analyzed in an international Phase 2/3 study  ACTISAVE  with clinical results expected in Q2 2024.In July 2022  Acticor Biotech was granted ""PRIME"" status by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for glenzocimab in the treatment of stroke. This designation will allow the company to strengthen its interactions and obtain early dialogues with regulatory authorities.Acticor Biotech is supported by a panel of European and international investors (Mediolanum farmaceutici  Karista  Go Capital  Newton Biocapital  CMS Medical Venture Investment (HK) Limited  A&B (HK) Limited  Anaxago  and the Armesa foundation).

Of those who had a booster dose at 1 year  96.9% of vaccinated individuals maintained a protective antibody response for 10 years. 1Post-exposure phase 4 prophylaxis clinical trials showed individuals bitten by animals with rabies and treated with a 5-dose regimen of Verorab ® were all alive 3 years after post-exposure prophylaxis. 1were all alive 3 years after post-exposure prophylaxis. Adverse reactions were moderate in intensity and most resolved within 1 to 3 days of their onset. 1Sanofi (EURONEXT: SAN and NASDAQ: SNY) has today announced the launch of Verorab ® (Sanofi Inactivated Rabies Vaccine) in the UK  an inactivated rabies vaccine indicated for pre-exposure and post-exposure prophylaxis of rabies in all age groups. 1This launch is based on extensive clinical data from over 13 000 individuals. 1 Sanofi Inactivated Rabies Vaccine has been approved and widely used in more than 80 countries. 2 It is estimated that between 41 and 70 million individuals have received the vaccine since its first licensure in May 1985  in France. 2Rabies is nearly always fatal once symptoms appear  but can be preventable with vaccination 3Each year  an estimated 59 000 people worldwide die from rabies. 4 That’s one person every nine minutes of every day 3   with approximately 95% of deaths occurring in Asia and Africa. 3 4 5 Individuals travelling to these countries should be aware of the risk of rabies and take the appropriate precautionary measures.Rebecca Catterick  UK and Ireland Sanofi Vaccines General Manager   said:“Rabies is a fatal  travel-related vaccine-preventable disease. The availability of Verorab ® in the UK provides an effective immunisation option for those travelling to high-risk countries  as well as a treatment for post-rabies exposure.”Joanna Lowry  Specialist Travel Nurse & Educator  said:“I am always surprised by the number of British travellers I meet who are unaware of the risk of rabies. Increasing awareness and sharing education on preventative measures is crucial to help reduce the possibility of this devastating disease.”Rabies in the UK is extremely rare  6 and the last case of classical rabies acquired in the UK occurred more than a century ago. 6Rabies is primarily transmitted by the bite  scratch  or lick of a rabid animal  99% of which are by dogs  but can also be other wildlife  such as foxes or bats. 6About Verorab ® (Sanofi Inactivated Rabies Vaccine)Sanofi Inactivated Rabies Vaccine is indicated for pre-exposure and post-exposure prophylaxis of rabies in all age groups and should be given according to official recommendations. 1 It can be used for both primary and booster vaccination and pre-exposure prophylaxis. 1 Post-exposure prophylaxis should be initiated as soon as possible after suspected exposure to rabies  and must be performed before administration of vaccine or rabies immunoglobulins  when they are indicated. 1 Pre-exposure vaccination consists of intramuscular (IM) injections of Sanofi Inactivated Rabies Vaccine. 1 Post-exposure prophylaxis can be administered via IM or intradermal (ID) routes. 1Most commonly observed side effects include pain at the injection site  a general feeling of discomfort or being unwell (malaise)  and headache. 1 Injection site reactions (pain  erythema and swelling) were more common after an ID injection than an IM injection. 1 Pain was the most common injection site reaction for both administration routes. 1Sanofi Inactivated Rabies Vaccine is available as a lyophilised powder and a solvent (sodium chloride) for suspension for injection  containing inactivated rabies virus  and is available with or without attached needles. 1About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people’s lives.

A unique  exclusive experience that each hotel creates to reflect its history and location  and which is offered along with its accommodation. With this campaign  MGallery reveals the wealth of Moments to be collected in its establishments.First  the suitcases land in China  at DongFengYun Hotel Mi'Le  where audiences discover a local skill  pottery  alongside a well-known artist. Then it’s on to Manly Hotel Pacific in Sydney  Australia  for a surfing lesson at dawn. The next stop is Vietnam  at Legacy Hotel Yen Tu  for a sunrise moment of reconnection with a climb up a sacred mountain  between heaven and earth. At Municipal Hotel & Spa Liverpool in the United Kingdom  duos enjoy an unforgettable teatime on the roof of the former town hall. The world tour ends with a step back in time  at the gates of Paris  France  at Domaine de la Reine Margot  with a tasting under the stained-glass windows of the former chapel. These immersive experiences are now available to all MGallery clients under a single slogan: “That’s my M Moment.”Traveling the world to find these precious moments was an unparalleled adventure  an authentic human experience. We discovered that each hotel has its own unique feel  brought to life by a special team with friendly professionalism and remarkable attention to detail. Diane Edelmann  CEO and Creative Director  OnirimThe M Moment lies in the detailsRevealed in conjunction with the new campaign  the collection’s experience pillars are being revitalized: MGallery has never been more aptly named. An M for Meaningful and for Memorable and also for Moments. From now on  clients will be able to enjoy even more unique  first-class adventures in every corner of the world. Created through the eyes of the locals  they enhance traditions and reflect remarkable destinations. A desire to explore is combined with a strong commitment to supporting local communities.This concept can also be found in MGallery hotels  where instant cameras allow staff to capture and share M Moments with guests. An interactive social media plan helps to immortalize the images of these very special moments.Being amazed by the beauty and magic of the Moment: that’s the spirit of MGallery.

Alpha MOS's two lead shareholders  Jolt Capital  and Ambrosia Investments are participating to the operation through the conversion of the convertible bonds they had subscribed to in 2023.These new financial resources will be used exclusively for the development of BOYDSense.

Vision is also seeking to put forward three nominees for appointment to the Board  all of whom were previously considered and rejected by shareholders at the recent extraordinary general meeting (“EGM”) requisitioned by Vision.Despite significant efforts by the Board to find a fair and reasonable basis for a settlement with Vision  including the offer of two seats on the Company’s Board  to prevent further disruption to the Company’s ongoing Strategic Review and which avoids the continued unnecessary use of shareholder funds  an agreement has not been reached.Since the EGM on 16 February 2024  the Board has continued to constructively engage with Vision  seeking to address its concerns while balancing the broader interests of all the Company’s shareholders. The Company has in that engagement made successive constructive  good faith proposals to Vision culminating in an offer to recommend two of its nominees for appointment to the Board at the AGM  subject to the parties agreeing the terms of a co-operation agreement. These discussions have not been successful to date.Vision has requested that I-RES use shareholders’ funds to cover a significant part of Vision’s activism costs. The Board does not believe that there is any justification for the Company to pay Vision’s voluntarily incurred expenses  which include costs related to the EGM at which Vision’s proposals were rejected by the Company’s shareholders. The Board considers this request to be highly unusual and inconsistent with good governance practice  and the Board remains committed to ensuring that decisions are made in the best interests of all shareholders.The Company has a diverse and majority independent Board  recently refreshed with new directors including a new highly regarded CEO  with an appropriate balance of skills and experience to deliver the Strategic Review which commenced on 23 February 2024. The Board has a mandate from shareholders supporting the ongoing Strategic Review which was endorsed at the EGM. The Strategic Review is exploring all options available to the Company to maximise value for shareholders  and an update will be provided to the market ahead of the Company’s AGM.ENDFor further information please contact:For Investor Relations at Irish Residential Properties REIT plc:Luke Ferriter  Investor Relations investors@iresreit.ie Tel: +353 (0) 1 563 4000Margaret Sweeney  Chief Executive Officer Tel: +353 (0) 1 557 0974For Media Queries:Padraig McKeon  I-RES PR and Communications Tel: + 353 (0) 87 231 2632Jonathan Neilan  FTI Consulting ires@fticonsulting.com Tel: +353 (0) 86 231 4135About Irish Residential Properties REIT plcIrish Residential Properties REIT plc (“I-RES”) is a growth oriented Real Estate Investment Trust providing quality professionally managed homes in sustainable communities in Ireland.

B - COMPONENTS OF THE REMUNERATION OF THE MEMBERS OF REN'S CORPORATE BODIES 3. Remuneration of the Executive Members of the Board of Directors 3.1. Principles 3.1.1. Regarding the remuneration of the executive members of the Board of Directors  the Remuneration Policy is based on the following principles: Competitiveness  taking into account Portuguese market practices; Based on objective  uniform  consistent  fair and balanced criteria that reward performance; Performance assessment in accordance with the duties and level of responsibility as well as effective performance  assumption of suitable levels of risk and compliance with the rules applicable to REN's activity  also taking into account compliance with REN's strategic plan and budget  risk management  the internal functioning of the Board of Directors and the contribution of each member for this purpose  as well as the relationship between the Company's bodies and committees; Incorporation of a variable remuneration component which is overall reasonable in relation to the fixed remuneration component  without encouraging excessive risk-taking  with a short-term component and a medium/long-term component  both with maximum limits; Alignment of the interests of executive members of the Board and those of the Company  its sustainability and long-term value creation  including by indexing medium/long-term remuneration to the evolution of REN's share price and ESG criteria; and Variable remuneration indexed to REN's effective performance  measured against specific  unambiguous and measurable objectives in line with the interests of REN's stakeholders. 3.2. Remuneration structure 3.2.1. The remuneration of the executive members of the Board of Directors (""Executive Members"") includes:a fixed component  corresponding to the fixed annual amount ("" Fixed Remuneration ""); and a variable component  the latter corresponding to a non-fixed amount dependent on the performance assessment  which may vary between a minimum of 0% and a maximum of 120% of the annual Fixed Remuneration ("" Variable Remuneration ""). The Variable Remuneration is made up of a short-term component and a medium/long-term component  each component corresponding to 50 per cent of Variable Remuneration  as described below . The members of the Board of Directors shall not enter into any agreements with REN or with any third party whose purpose or effect is to directly mitigate the risk inherent in the variability of the remuneration established by REN. 3.3. Fixed Remuneration The Fixed Remuneration of the Executive Members of the Board of Directors corresponds to a fixed gross annual amount of € 401 822.48 (four hundred and one thousand eight hundred and twenty-two euros and forty-eight cents) in the case of the Chairman of the Executive Committee  and € 318 326.96 (three hundred and eighteen thousand three hundred and twenty-six euros and ninety-six cents) in the case of the other Executive Members of the Board of Directors  to be paid in 12 monthly instalments. Without prejudice to the limitation in the following paragraph  the Fixed Remuneration of the executive members shall be updated annually in accordance with the Consumer Price Index (CPI)  provided that: (i) the CPI has not shown negative values; and (ii) in the year in question the fixed remuneration has not been increased  such update being applied annually in accordance with the equation below: +1 = ∗ Where: = 1 + average annual percentage change in the Consumer Price Index estimated from January to December of the previous year (year t) to that of the General Meeting. 3.3.3. In any case  the update of the Fixed Remuneration of the Executive Members will not exceed the average update applied that year to the REN Group's employees in general and will beadjusted to this update value whenever the above equation results in an increase greater than that of the employees. 3.3.4. Fixed Remuneration consists only of basic pay  with no other remuneration or allowances (i.e. travelling expenses or meal allowances)  without prejudice to ""Other monetary and non- monetary benefits"" described in clause 3.5. below. 3.4. Variable Remuneration The Variable Remuneration of the Executive Members of the Board of Directors is awarded on the basis of the performance assessment which is executed in accordance with clause 3.4.2 below  with the relationship between performance and Variable Remuneration being that established by clause 0 below. Calculation of Variable Remuneration based on Performance Assessment The annual assessment of the performance of Executive Members of the Board of Directors for the purposes of granting Variable Remuneration is carried out by the Remuneration Committee  based on the opinion of the Company's major shareholders  as well as Non- Executive Members  considering a report to be prepared by the Appointments and Assessment Committee by March of the following year  based on the fulfilment of predefined objectives  based on Key Performance Indicators (""KPIs"")  indexed to metrics of REN's strategic plan. Up to the end of March of each year  the Audit Committee must validate the figures that serve as a reference for assessing compliance with REN's KPIs. The annual final assessment of performance and the setting of Variable Remuneration by the Remuneration Committee must be finalised before the General Meeting approving the accounts for the financial year in question  in accordance with the level of compliance with KPIs defined in 3.4.2.6 below and is subject to the approval of the annual accounts by the general meeting of shareholders in its exact terms. The individual performance evaluation of an Executive Member of the Board of Directors will only be taken into account when it is negative  in which case the Variable Remuneration will not be granted to that Executive Member.The individual performance evaluation of each member of the Executive Committee by the Remuneration Committee will include the contribution of each member to the functioning of the body and the cooperation between the various bodies of the Company  for which purpose  the report prepared by the Nomination and Evaluation Committee will be considered  and the non-executive members of the Board of Directors will be heard. REN's KPIs are defined on a consolidated basis as follows: Objectives related to REN's KPIs % KPIs Average cost of debt 10% Return on invested capital (ROIC) 10% Operating cash flow 25% Net profit per share 25% Financial 70% Quality of service 15% Operational 15% Health and Safety 3 75% Gender diversity 3 75% Reduction of greenhouse gas emissions 3 75% Rating Performance 3 75% ESG 15%3.4.2.7. The percentage of overall fulfilment of the objectives established by the Board of Directors in relation to each KPI will correspond to a certain Variable Remuneration as indicated in the Variable Remuneration metric below: % of objectives achieved % of Fixed Remuneration to be granted as Variable Remuneration ≤ 79 99% 0 80% - 89 99% 20% 90% - 94 99% 40% 95% - 99 99% 80% 100% - 119 99% 100% - 119.99%  in proportion to the level of compliance ≥ 120% 120% 3.4.2.8. The final performance assessment for the purposes of calculating Variable Remuneration is calculated as the arithmetic mean of the level of achievement of each KPI  weighted by its respective weight  this level of achievement being expressed by the percentage of Fixed Remuneration to be awarded as Variable Remuneration and quantified in the table in 3.4.2.7. The equation is as follows: = ∑ ∗ =1 Where: = Performance; = Weight of the ith KPI; = Degree of achievement of the ith KPI  i.e. percentage of Fixed Remuneration to be awarded as overall Variable Remuneration for a given KPI. 3.4.3. Payment of Variable Remuneration 3.4.3.1. For payment purposes  the Variable Remuneration is divided into two components  each corresponding to 50 per cent of the total Variable Remuneration awarded by reference to the relevant annual period  as follows:The short-term variable remuneration ("" STVR"" )  which is awarded and paid in cash within 30 days of the annual shareholders' meeting approving the annual accounts; and Medium/long-term variable remuneration ("" MLTVR "") which is awarded and paid in accordance with the terms and conditions set out below. 3.4.4. Medium/long-term variable remuneration 3.4.4.1. THE MLTVR: Must be allocated in Remuneration Units (""RU""); The number of RUs is calculated by dividing the value assigned to the MLTVR by the unit value of the RU  which is calculated in accordance with point c) below; The value of each RU for MLTVR purposes will be equal to the average closing price of REN shares on the Euronext Lisbon market in the 30 days prior to the date of the general meeting of shareholders approving the annual accounts for the relevant financial year; The value of each RU will be adjusted  over time and after its initial calculation  by an amount equal to the Total Shareholder Return (TSR) of REN's shares and the number or value of the RUs attributed may be adjusted in accordance with the corporate facts/events affecting REN's shares (such as stock splits   reverse stock splits  reduction of the nominal value of shares  reduction of share capital  among others)  in order to obtain a financial remuneration equivalent to the effective ownership of a number of shares equal to the RUs initially attributed; The MLTVR must be paid in cash and will be deferred for a period of three years after the award date  with one third being paid each year  starting the year after the award.
