Adverse weather  including ...,PARIS: Euronext wheat futures rose on Friday  tracking a rally in Chicago as delays to some Russian exports and concern about an escalation in fighting between Russia and Ukraine encouraged participants to cover positions.Adverse weather  including dryness in parts of North America and the Black Sea region  as well as damp conditions in France  also supported prices as the market enters the sensitive spring growing season in the northern hemisphere.May milling wheat  the most active position on Paris-based Euronext  was 1.4% up at 202.75 euros ($219.80) a metric ton by 1615 GMT.Chicago wheat was up 2% in US trading. Fresh reports of administrative delays to Russian export cargoes  including vessels bound for major importer Egypt  unsettled the market like two weeks ago.“There is definitely more market concern that something is happening to hinder Russian grain shipments ” a German trader said. However  futures pared earlier gains after news that two grain cargoes  including one for Egypt  had received phyto-sanitary certificates from Russian authorities.Some traders played down the idea of further cargo delays and noted that Russian prices were stable  albeit maintaining recent gains.“Currently I cannot see signs of more ships being delayed in Russian ports because of the phyto-sanitary dispute between export houses and the authorities ” said one Russian trader involved in Russian business. “It seems to be more fear of delays than actual delays.”,neutral,0.03,0.68,0.29,negative,0.03,0.21,0.77,True,English,"['Black Sea risks', 'EU wheat', 'short', 'sensitive spring growing season', 'Black Sea region', 'two grain cargoes', 'May milling wheat', 'Russian grain shipments', 'Russian export cargoes', 'one Russian trader', 'Euronext wheat futures', 'Paris-based Euronext', 'German trader', 'export houses', 'Russian exports', 'Russian ports', 'Russian business', 'Chicago wheat', 'Adverse weather', 'North America', 'damp conditions', 'northern hemisphere', 'active position', 'metric ton', 'US trading', 'Fresh reports', 'major importer', 'earlier gains', 'phyto-sanitary certificates', 'recent gains', 'phyto-sanitary dispute', 'Russian authorities', 'Russian prices', 'administrative delays', 'cargo delays', 'actual delays', 'market concern', 'Friday', 'rally', 'escalation', 'fighting', 'Ukraine', 'participants', 'positions', 'dryness', 'parts', 'France', '202.75 euros', '1615 GMT', 'vessels', 'Egypt', 'something', 'news', 'traders', 'idea', 'signs', 'ships', 'fear']",2024-04-07,2024-04-07,brecorder.com
