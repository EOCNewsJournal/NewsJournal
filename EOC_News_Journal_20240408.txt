The Russian central bank's assets were frozen shortly after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and have remained so ever since. The securities and cash frozen in the G7  the EU  and Australia are estimated to be worth roughly 260 billion euros ($282 billion). Assets worth an estimated 210 billion euros are in the EU  mostly in Belgium  the home of Euroclear  a user-owned financial services company specializing in securities transactions.In February  the first step by Brussels was completed by setting aside the profits accumulated from the frozen assets. On March 20  the European Commission proposed the initiation of the second and final step -- sending the actual cash to Ukraine. This comes after EU foreign ministers  two days before  tasked EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell with coming up with a proposal for making this happen. None of the 27 member states have objected so far  although it's far from a done deal. Leaders and officials from EU member states still have to study the European Commission's proposal and give it a unanimous green light. Diplomats and officials are expected to start studying the fine print of the text today.Deep Background: The proposal  seen by RFE/RL  notes that the first step of the process  the setting aside of profits  started on February 15 this year: ""the central securities depositories (CSDs) are prohibited from disposing of these profits  or distributing them to shareholders  until the [European] Council decides on the financial contribution to be raised on them to support Ukraine."" CSDs are institutions  such as Euroclear  that hold and administer securities and enable their transactions. The step is thought to have raised something between 2.5 billion and 3 billion euros. The European Commission hopes that this money can be sent to Ukraine by July  provided that member states approve. There are also hopes in Brussels that comparable sums can be sent to Kyiv each year after that  depending on annual interest rates.There are a number of ""assurances"" in Borrell's proposal for member states worried that this move could amount to a seizure of private property -- with private ownership being a fundamental EU right -- or could damage the bloc's common currency  the euro. The document notes that ""the generation of unexpected and extraordinary revenues...are not the property of the Russian central bank as there is no legal or contractual provision for interest to be paid to the owners of the principal. Since these revenues only exist as a result of the restrictive measures  there can also be no legitimate expectation that they should remain with the central securities depositories and their shareholders."" The proposal also added that any retroactive claims by Moscow won't be accepted: ""Unexpected and extraordinary revenues do not have to be made available to the central bank of Russia under applicable rules  even after the discontinuation of the transaction prohibition. Thus  they do not constitute sovereign assets. Therefore  the rules protecting sovereign assets are not applicable to these revenues.""Drilling DownThere are other ""goodies"" to entice member states to quickly come on board with the proposal: an expected 3 percent of the profits from the frozen assets will remain with the CSDs ""to ensure the efficiency of their work."" In the future  the financial services companies will also be able to provisionally retain 10 percent of the profits to cover potential legal fees  as it's highly likely that Russia will take them to court.Several EU officials I have spoken to on background have played down the possibility of damaging the euro's position as the second reserve currency in the world. The fact that Brussels has pondered this move for several months already without any impact on the common currency in terms of trading or value is being cited in support of that argument. Another argument in support of the move is that other G7 countries are also mulling similar moves  so it might not be just the euro that is potentially exposed.Then there is the European Commission's proposal of how the money should be spent  which gives member states even more potential oversight -- and even veto opportunities. Initially  it was thought that the money generated from the profits would go to the reconstruction of Ukraine. But as the war drags on and no one expects widespread reconstruction to start anytime soon  the EU proposal states that 90 percent of the money should go to the supply of military equipment for Kyiv and the remaining 10 percent to regular financial aid.That proposed 10 percent would be channeled via the regular EU budget  so it doesn't need an explicit green light from any member states. But the 90 percent should go via the European Peace Facility (EPF)  an off-EU-budget mechanism that has allowed Brussels to send money to Ukraine for arms purchases. The EU has so far sent 5.6 billion euros ($6.1 billion) for the purchase of arms and artillery to Kyiv over the last two years via EPF but has  for the last 10 months  failed to sign off on a 500 million-euro EPF tranche after a long-standing Hungarian veto. The veto stems from Budapest's dispute with Kyiv over a blacklist produced by Ukraine's National Agency on Corruption Prevention. The Hungarian bank  OTP  is on that blacklist and labeled an ""international sponsor of war"" as it continues to do business in Russia.While the bank was de-listed in the fall  Budapest has sought assurances that it won't happen again in the future  something that so far has not occurred. Recently  the EPF ceiling was raised by 5 billion euros specifically for Ukraine  paving the way for even more EU cash for weapons for Ukraine.But the rules of the game have not changed. This means that national vetoes  such as the Hungarian one  will be a crucial factor for future tranches. And that means the windfall may not end up in Ukraine by the summer after all.Brief#2: NATO at 75 -- Aging But Still Agile?What You Need To Know: On April 4  NATO celebrated 75 years. Manneken Pis  Brussels' iconic fountain statue of a little boy peeing  was decked out in a NATO costume  and the original Washington treaty  which established the military alliance in 1949  was flown to Brussels from the U.S. capital under tight security for the foreign ministers of the 32 NATO allies to admire.But that was about as much fun as the aging military organization could manage for now. The foreign ministers were gathering on April 3-4  about three months before a crucial NATO summit in Washington on July 9-11. And  at their meeting  they dealt with the same issues that member-state leaders will in the summer -- the war in Ukraine and how NATO can shore up its support for Kyiv; Ukraine's prospects of NATO membership; and  finally  who should replace Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg as he bows out after a decade at the helm later this year. No decisions were made by the ministers on any of these issues last week -- a luxury that their bosses  at the July summit  can ill afford.Deep Background: The most pressing issue is military support for Ukraine. With the U.S aid for Ukraine  worth nearly $60 billion  still stuck in Congress  Kyiv's European friends are scrambling to get whatever they can to their outgunned partner amid fears of a Russian offensive in the coming months penetrating Ukrainian defensive lines.Still  the mood is slightly less grim than when I spoke to NATO officials earlier this year. ""It's gloomy at the moment but not catastrophic. Russia is advancing a bit  albeit slowly "" said one diplomat  who was not authorized to speak on the record. Earlier this year  the main issue was how to get artillery shells to Ukraine. While that issue is far from being resolved  NATO members are at least starting to churn them out domestically and procure them around the globe.The glaring problem now is air defenses  especially missiles to protect Ukrainian cities and infrastructure. Unlike shells  missiles are not something that can be easily sourced outside the alliance or produced quickly in member countries. Before the meeting of the foreign ministers  Stoltenberg suggested a solution to the funding issue for the war effort in which NATO would give Ukraine a five-year military-aid package worth up to $100 billion. Under Stoltenberg's plan  the money would be provided by all member states  with contributions based on the countries' gross national income (GNI)  which is used to fund NATO's common budget. The question is whether all members will be on board by July  in time for the summit.Drilling DownThe secretary-general's proposal is very much part of what NATO officials refer to as the ""institutionalization of Ukraine aid."" In essence  this is NATO's attempt to take over various ad hoc initiatives to aid Ukraine. Consider the 50-country Ukraine Defense Contact Group (also known as the Ramstein format)  which is now under U.S. leadership and meets almost monthly to provide Ukraine with arms. Or the F-16 coalition  a group of about a dozen NATO allies training Ukrainian pilots to handle the fighter jet.The military alliance is already facing obstacles  however  with one of them being Hungary. Budapest is against any move that would suggest that NATO is involved in a war  including the military alliance taking over the training of Ukrainian soldiers. There was an aim inside the organization to finalize a draft mandate for a Ukraine mission -- which would take over the various efforts to provide military aid -- at last week's meeting of foreign ministers  but the proposal is far from ready.There has also been little movement on Ukraine's potential membership in NATO. At the alliance's summit in Vilnius last year  it was agreed to do away with the Membership Action Plan (MAP) for Ukraine. The MAP is basically all the necessary political and military reforms that new members have to undertake before joining.But since then  Ukraine's path to possible membership has not been clearer  and there is no timeline. Eastern member states  such as those in the Baltic region  want to go beyond the ""Vilnius language "" but others  such as the United States and Germany  don't. Even if Ukraine did fulfill conditions for membership  such as anti-corruption and security-sector reforms  the elephant in the room is still the war. With almost no appetite for a direct war with Russia  membership is extremely unlikely as long as the fighting continues.That raises many questions: What can NATO offer  if anything  in Washington in July? Some sort of partial membership that only covers the territories that Kyiv has under its political control? Can or even should Kyiv accept such a deal that would de facto partition the country? And will all 32 members of the alliance agree to offer such a thing?And finally  there is the issue of replacing Stoltenberg. This was supposed to be wrapped up in early April with the big four -- France  Germany  the United Kingdom  and the United States -- officially backing outgoing Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte. In fact  most other members also appear to support Rutte's candidacy  including several eastern-flank countries such as Estonia and Poland.Hungary  however  is ardently against the Dutchman while Turkey  for now  is sitting on the fence. Some ministers raised it in Brussels last week and backed Rutte but there is no consensus yet -- plus there is another candidate  Romanian President Klaus Iohannis  who hasn't given up yet. Expect a lot of wheeling and dealing  which will likely drag on well into the summer.Looking AheadThere is expected to be a ruling on April 10 in the European Court of Justice on whether the sanctions against Russian businessmen Petr Aven and Mikhail Fridman should remain in place. In March  the Russian racing driver Nikita Mazepin  son of oligarch Dmitry Mazepin  won his case in the Luxembourg-based court  even though he remains listed for now. The EU can also still challenge the court's decision and present potential new evidence for the sanctions to remain in place.That same day  the European Parliament will debate the recent Russian presidential election  which was without opposition and marred by fraud. Expect the revelation from last week that several European politicians  including some members of the European Parliament  were promoted or even paid by the pro-Russian news portal Voice of Europe to be brought up as well.That's all for this week.

The Company's board of directors has made an overall evaluation and carefully considered raising the necessary capital only through a rights issue  but has made the assessment that  for several reasons  it is more favorable for the Company and the shareholders to partially raise capital in the capital raising through a directed issue. Among other things  the directed issue reduces the need for guarantee commitments in the rights issue. The Company's board of directors has in this context also noted the discounts at which rights issues on the Swedish stock market are usually carried out and assesses that a rights issue  without the directed issue  would probably have been carried out at a lower subscription price and exposed the Company and the shareholders to a higher market risk for a longer period of time. The directed issue also contributes to strengthening the shareholder base in the Company with international institutional investors  which is considered positive in a long-term perspective. Since the subscription price in the directed issue was determined by the board of directors based on arms-length discussions with investors at a price corresponding to the closing price of the Company's share on Nasdaq First North Growth Market on 4 April 2024  it is the board of directors' assessment that the subscription price in the directed issue therefore reflects current market conditions and demand. Conclusively  the directed issue is deemed to be in the interest of the Company and all shareholders. The subscription price for each unit is SEK 0.42  corresponding to a subscription price of SEK 0.42 per share. The amount that exceeds the share's quota value shall be transferred to the unrestricted premium reserve. Warrants of series TO 2 are issued free of charge. The subscription price has been determined based on an assessment of the current market situation  the historical development of the business and the Company's business prospects. Subscription of units shall be made no later than on 13 May 2024. Payment shall be made no later than on 15 May 2024. The board of directors shall have the right to extend the time for subscription and payment.

The MET-C platform enables MaaT Pharma to produce microbiome therapies at a large-scale to meet the needs of larger market indications. The first-in-human study is expected to be initiated in 2025.The data published represents significant advancements in understanding the mechanism of action (MoA) of co-cultured microbiome therapies developed by MaaT Pharma  marking a major step towards clinical evaluation. The results demonstrate that MaaT034 produced key metabolites  recognized as promoting gut barrier restoration and modulating immune responses  such as Short-Chain Fatty Acids (SCFA)  secondary bile acids  and tryptophan derivatives. These findings support the role of MaaT034 in gut barrier repair and in T cell reactivation either in combination with Nivolumab (anti-PD1) or with Atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1). By enhancing gut barrier repair and modulating immune responses  MaaT034 is expected to complement the action of these immunotherapeutic agents  potentially improving their efficacy in treating solid tumors cancer.Data are currently being shared in a poster format at the conference titled  ""Evaluation of a new co-cultured microbiome ecosystem therapy candidate (MaaT034) for clinical testing as adjuvant/neoadjuvant to immune checkpoint inhibitors in solid tumors.""Story continuesAbout MaaT PharmaMaaT Pharma  a clinical-stage biotechnology company  has established a complete approach to restoring patient-microbiome symbiosis in oncology.

This causes major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care  they become ineffective  untolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing ""diuretic-resistant"" patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  delivering major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients and reducing costs for healthcare systems.The Company's Premarket Approval (PMA) application for the alfapump was submitted to the US FDA in December 2023 and accepted for substantive review in January 2024  having reported positive primary and secondary endpoint data from the North American pivotal POSEIDON study in recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis.Results of the Company's RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure support DSR's mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE  a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study  have been successfully treated with DSR  resulting in a dramatic improvement in diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements. The independent Data Safety Monitoring Board approved the start of the randomized MOJAVE cohort of up to a further 30 patients  which is planned after alfapump US PMA approval.Sequana Medical is listed on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels.Important Regulatory DisclaimersThe alfapump® system is currently not approved in the United States or Canada. In the United States and Canada  the alfapump system is currently under clinical investigation (POSEIDON Trial) and is being studied in adult patients with refractory or recurrent ascites due to liver cirrhosis. DSR® therapy is still in development and it should be noted that any statements regarding safety and efficacy arise from ongoing pre-clinical and clinical investigations which have yet to be completed. There is no link between DSR therapy and ongoing investigations with the alfapump system in Europe  the United States or Canada.Note: alfapump® and DSR® are registered trademarks.Forward-looking statementsThis press release may contain predictions  estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking statements.Such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance.
