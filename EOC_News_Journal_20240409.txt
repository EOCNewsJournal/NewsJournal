The resolutions under items (a) and(b) are proposed to be conditional upon each other and for that reason it is proposed that such resolutions are passed as one resolution.The terms and conditions of this resolution to amend LTIP 2021-2026 shall replace the terms and conditions of the resolution approved at the annual general meeting held on 25 May 2023 and shall apply to grants made after the date of this resolution. In the event this resolution is not passed  the current terms and conditions of LTIP 2021-2026 will remain in force in accordance with the resolution passed at the annual general meeting held on 25 May 2023.(a) - Proposal on amendment of LTIP 2021-2026The board of directors proposes that the AGM resolves to amend LTIP 2021-2026.

The participants have for this reason been divided into the below five categories  which may each comprise current and future employees or long-term consultants of the Oatly group.The right to be granted stock options or RSUs out of LTIP 2021-2026 shall be reserved for participants in Categories A  B  C  D and E. Stock options and RSUs may be granted on one or more occasionsduring each financial year  but grants may not be made to a greater number of participants per Category and financial year than the maximum number set out below:Category A: CEO (not more than one participant per financial year)Category B: Other members of the executive management team and top key personnel (not more than 25 participants per financial year)Category C: Selected senior key personnel (not more than 975 participants per financial year)Category D: Selected mid-level key personnel (not more than 999 participants per financial year)Category E: Other personnel (not more than 2 000 participants per financial year)The below allocation principles shall apply to the grant of stock options and RSUs within  respectively  Categories A  B  C  D and E. The maximum numbers listed below shall apply for each financial year irrespective of whether grants are made on one or more occasions and the board of directors shall not be prevented from allocating less Awards than the maximum numbers set out in the tables below. The board of directors intend to apply the allocation principles with an aim to achieve an appropriate allocation size on an annual basis. The size of annual allocations may vary depending on  among other things  individual seniority  total compensation mix  personnel changes and fluctuations in the market price of the Company's ADSs. Further  the total number of Awards granted may never exceed the number of Treasury Warrants available to secure the settlement of Awards. Thus  the number of Awards available to be granted during individual years for the duration of LTIP 2021-2026 may vary depending on the outcome of such factors. The development of such factors may entail that the number of Treasury Warrants available for grants during later years of LTIP 2021-2026 are insufficient to achieve a proportional annual allocation.Maximum allocation per participant and year within each CategoryThe below table outlines the maximum number of each type of Awards that may be allocated per participant and year within each Category.

If additional Treasury Warrants become available for grants  inter alia due to the expiration  lapsing or termination of grants made prior to or following this resolution proposal  due to the maximum number of Awards not having been allocated during any year  and/or the 2024 Option Exchange Program  such additional available Treasury Warrants shall be applied to increase the number of stock options and RSUs available to be granted during the remaining years of LTIP 2021-2026 in accordance with the following principles:The number of additional Treasury Warrants having become available as hedging instruments during a year shall be divided by the number of years remaining up to and including 2026 (such calculation to include the year the hedging instruments have become available)  and the quotient shall then increase the maximum number of stock options and RSUs available to be granted in Categories A  B  C  D and E in proportion to the maximum number of Awards in each Category as stated in the table above. (i)The maximum number of participants per year in each Category and the maximum number of Awards per participant in each category may not be exceeded. (ii)Non-allocated AwardsIn the event all stock options or RSUs within Categories A  B  C  D and E are not granted  such non-granted stock options and RSUs may be offered to participants in another category with less stock options and/or RSUs available for allotment during the relevant financial year. The maximum number of stock options and/or RSUs per participant within each category as set out above may however not be exceeded for any individual.SettlementThe board of directors shall be entitled to decide that participants may  instead of delivery of Treasury Warrants  ADSs or shares in the Company  be offered cash settlement upon exercise of stock options or RSUs granted under LTIP 2021-2026 in accordance with the provisions of the Oatly Incentive Plan.(b) - Proposal on approval of transfer of Treasury InstrumentsOatly retains  and will in the future retain  the Treasury Warrants. Each Treasury Warrant gives a right to subscribe for one share in the Company at a price equal to the quota value of the Company's share (currently SEK 0.0015) before or on 31 December 2040.The board of directors proposes that the AGM approves that transfers of Treasury Warrants  shares or ADSs resulting from the exercise of the Treasury Warrants (jointly the ""Treasury Instruments"") may occur on the following terms and conditions:The right to acquire Treasury Instruments shall be granted to participants covered by the terms and conditions of LTIP 2021-2026 (as amended  including for the avoidance of doubt in relation to the 2024 Option Exchange Program). Transfers may be made against no consideration  against consideration corresponding to the quota value of shares in the Company or against consideration in another amount  in each case pursuant to the terms of Awards granted under LTIP 2021-2026. (i)Treasury Instruments may be transferred to third parties engaged or established for settlement of exercises of Awards within LTIP 2021-2026 and ancillary services  or otherwise sold or disposed of  for purposes of securing delivery of shares or ADSs or otherwise settling exercises of Awards under LTIP 2021-2026. Treasury Instruments may be transferred to and by such third parties against no consideration  against consideration corresponding to the quota value of shares in the Company or against consideration in another amount. (ii)Treasury Instruments may be transferred during such periods as may be necessary or appropriate for purposes of securing delivery of shares or ADSs or otherwise settling exercises of Awards under LTIP 2021-2026. (iii)The number of ADSs in the Company that may be transferred under LTIP 2021-2026 may be subject to recalculation in the event of a split  reverse split  ADS ratio change  etc. pursuant to the terms of the Oatly Incentive Plan. (iv)For the avoidance of doubt  the approval of transfers of Treasury Instruments under this Item 16(b) shall not be deemed to limit  restrict or prevent any assignment  transfer or other disposal of warrants in the Company approved by the extraordinary general meeting held on 6 May 2021 or the annual general meeting on 25 May 2023 with respect to grants of RSUs or stock options made prior to the approval of this resolution proposal  and transfer of such warrants may also occur on the terms and conditions of this Item 16(b).(c) - Proposal regarding 2024 Option Exchange ProgramBetween May 2021 and July 2023  the Company granted stock options on several occasions to approximately 38 senior key employees (the ""Exchange Holders""). As of the date of this proposal  a total of 18 964 730 stock options are outstanding and held by the Exchange Holders (the ""Relevant Options"").The Relevant Options have an exercise price between USD 17.00 and USD 1.56 (equal to 100% of the fair market value of an ADS at the time of grant of the relevant stock option). The exercise price for each Relevant Option is thus greater than the market value of an ADS in the Company as of the date of this proposal (often referred to as ""underwater"" or ""out-of-the-money"").Given the period of time that some Relevant Options have remained significantly underwater  and the need to retain and continuously incentivize our senior key employees  the remuneration committee and the board of directors consider that it is in the best interest of the Company to create the 2024 Option Exchange Program.The 2024 Option Exchange Program will provide a retention benefit for the senior key employees  while reducing the need to grant additional equity awards. Further  as a result of the Exchange RSUs (asdefined below) having a new vesting period compared to the Relevant Options  the senior key employees will be better retained for an additional period of time.The board of directors therefore proposes that the Company carries out the 2024 Option Exchange Program through which the Company will offer the Exchange Holders the opportunity to exchange the Relevant Options for new RSUs with special vesting conditions (the ""Exchange RSUs"")  as further set out below.The terms and conditions set out in this section (c) - Proposal regarding 2024 Option Exchange Program shall prevail and apply notwithstanding anything contrary set out otherwise in this proposal.The offer to exchange the Relevant Options against Exchange RSUs (the ""Exchange Offer"") shall be made to all Exchange Holders. Notwithstanding the foregoing  the board of directors shall  provided that this is allowed under the Oatly Incentive Plan and applicable rules and laws  have the right to exclude individual Exchange Holders from the Exchange Offer if this is deemed to be in the best interest of the Company and/or if the Exchange Offer cannot be directed to certain Exchange Holder(s) due to applicable rules and laws.The Exchange Offer shall be made no later than 31 December 2024.The Exchange Holders shall be offered the opportunity to receive such number of Exchange RSUs as is equal in value to the Relevant Options being exchanged by the Exchange Holder  provided  however  that one Relevant Option shall never entitle to more than one Exchange RSU. The total number of Exchange RSUs that can be granted under the Option Exchange Program will accordingly be limited to 18 964 730 (equal to the number of Relevant Options).The value of each Relevant Option and each Exchange RSU shall be calculated using the Black-Scholes formula  and be based on the weighted average price of the Company's ADS for a period of at least twenty trading days prior to the Exchange Offer. Assuming a weighted average price of the Company's ADS for the relevant period of USD 1.00  one Relevant Option would entitle the Exchange Holder to approximately 0.04 to 0.48 Exchange RSUs (depending on the exercise price for the Relevant Option). Assuming a weighted average price of the Company's ADS for the relevant period of USD 1.50  one Relevant Option would entitle the Exchange Holder to approximately 0.07 to 0.59 Exchange RSUs (depending on the exercise price for the Relevant Option). The total number of Exchange RSUs that an Exchange Holder shall receive will be rounded down to the nearest whole number.The terms and conditions for RSUs set out in the section (a) - Proposal on amendment of LTIP 2021-2026 above shall apply to the Exchange RSUs  subject to the following:Exchange RSUs may be granted without consideration no later than 31 December 2024.Exchange RSUs may only be granted to Exchange Holders that accept the Exchange Offer and exchange Relevant Options.The allocation principles and maximum allocation restrictions set out in the section Allocation principles  etc. above shall not apply to the Exchange RSUs  and the Exchange RSUs shall not be counted towards such maximum allocation restrictions.Exchange RSUs granted will be subject to time-based vesting requirements. The granted Exchange RSUs will vest and become exercisable in equal instalments on eachof the first two annual vesting dates falling after the grant date. The first annual vesting date shall not fall earlier than six months following the date of grant  and the second annual vesting date shall fall no earlier than the first anniversary of the first annual vesting date. Vesting is conditional upon the participant remaining employed or engaged by the Oatly group at the applicable vesting date. If the participant has ceased to be employed or engaged by the Oatly group due to the group's termination without Cause or due to death  Disability or Qualifying Retirement (as such terms are defined in the Oatly Incentive Plan)  any unvested Exchange RSUs may become immediately vested and exercisable.The terms and conditions for the Exchange RSUs may differ between countries due to differences in local legislation  however the terms and conditions may not be more favourable for participants than the terms and conditions of this resolution proposal.- Resolution regarding (a) amendment of resolution on issue of share awards to certain members of the board of directors of Oatly Group AB (publ) and (b) approval of transfer of treasury warrants issued in connection with the share award programBackground and reasonOatly has in 2021 adopted an incentive award plan (the ""Oatly Incentive Plan"") under which the Company may  subject to approval by the shareholders at a general meeting  issue different types of awards  including stock options  restricted stock units and other incentive awards.Pursuant to the Oatly Incentive Plan  an extraordinary general meeting held on 6 May 2021 resolved to implement an incentive program for members of the board of directors who are not employed by the Oatly group  or by Verlinvest  China Resources  Blackstone or Östersjöstiftelsen  under the Oatly Incentive Plan (the ""Board LTIP""). The Board LTIP was amended through a resolution at the annual general meeting on 25 May 2023.In order to secure delivery of shares under the Board LTIP  the general meeting held on 6 May 2021 resolved on issue and approval of transfer of 1 389 933 warrants of series 2021-B  each exercisable into one share in the Company.Equity-based awards are a central part of an attractive and competitive remuneration package in order to attract  retain and motivate internationally competent members of the board of directors  and to focus the participants on delivering exceptional performance which contributes to value creation for all shareholders. Granting equity-based awards to certain members of the board of directors will increase and strengthen the participants' dedication to Oatly's operations  improve company loyalty and be beneficial to both the shareholders and Oatly.The Company's remuneration committee has identified a need to adjust the allocation principles set forth in the Board LTIP in order to achieve a competitive allocation of share awards (""Share Awards"") under the Board LTIP. In order to achieve competitive individual allocations based on the current market value of the Company's ADS  the maximum number of Share Awards that may be granted to each participant is proposed to be increased from 35 000 to 140 000 Share Awards annually. However  the limitation on the total value of Share Awards that may be granted to each participant will remain unchanged at USD 140 000 annually.It is therefore proposed that the AGM resolves to approve an amendment of the Board LTIP and the transfer of warrants of series 2021-B in accordance with items (a) and (b) below. The resolutions under items (a) and (b) are proposed to be conditional upon each other and for that reason it is proposed that both resolutions are passed as one resolution.The terms and conditions of this resolution to amend the Board LTIP shall replace the terms and conditions of the resolution approved by the annual general meeting held on 25 May 2023 and shall apply to awards made after the date of this resolution. In the event this resolution is not passed  the current terms and conditions of LTIP 2021-2026 will remain in force in accordance with the resolution passed by the annual general meeting held on 25 May 2023.(a) - Proposal on amendment of the Board LTIPIt is proposed that the AGM resolves to amend the Board LTIP. The Board LTIP was implemented  and is amended  under and pursuant to the Oatly Incentive Plan.In addition to the 251 140 Share Awards granted to members of the board of directors under the Board LTIP which have vested or remain outstanding as of the date of this resolution proposal  1 138 793 Share Awards remain to be granted following the amendment proposed under this resolution proposal.Below is a description of the main terms and conditions for the Share Awards following the amendment pursuant to this resolution proposal.The Share Awards shall be granted to members of the board of directors who are not employed by the Oatly group  or by Verlinvest  China Resources or Blackstone.Each participant may each year be granted a number of Share Awards equivalent to USD 140 000  as determined by the closing price of the Company's ADS on Nasdaq Global Select Market on the last trading day immediately preceding the date of grant of the Share Award  provided however that in no event shall a participant be awarded more than 140 000 Share Awards per year  and the total number of Share Awards awarded to all participants  excluding Share Awards that have lapsed  been terminated or forfeited  shall in no event exceed 1 389 933.The Share Awards shall be granted free of charge to the participants no later than 31 December 2026.The Share Awards shall vest on the date of the next annual general meeting after the date of grant  provided that the participant is still a board member of Oatly on such date.Each vested Share Award entitles the holder to receive one share  warrant of series 2021-B or ADS in the Company without any compensation being payable (or at a price equal to the quota value of the Company's shares)  provided that the holder is still a board member of Oatly at the relevant time of vesting.The Share Awards may not be transferred or pledged.The number of shares  warrants of series 2021-B or ADSs in the Company that each Share Award entitles to subscription for will be adjusted in the event of a split  reverse split  ADS ratio change  etc. in accordance with customary re-calculation terms.(b) - Proposal transfer of warrants of series 2021-BIn order to fulfill the commitments arising from the Share Awards  it is proposed that the AGM authorizes that the Company may assign the warrants of series 2021-B to a third party  or in another way dispose of the warrants of series 2021-B  in accordance with the above.Majority requirementsApproval of the proposals according to item 16 and 17 requires that the AGM's resolutions are supported by shareholders representing at least nine tenths of the votes cast and shares represented at the AGM.DocumentsDocuments that shall be made available prior to the AGM pursuant to the Swedish Companies Act will be made available at Oatly  Ångfärjekajen 8  Malmö  and on Oatly's website at https://investors.oatly.com/corporate-governance/2024agm no later than from and including 24 April 2024. The documents will be sent to shareholders who so request and provide their postal address.Shareholders' right to receive informationThe board of directors and the CEO shall  if any shareholder so requests and the board of directors believes that it can be done without material harm to the Company  provide information regarding circumstances that may affect the assessment of an item on the agenda and the Company's relation to other companies within the group.Processing of personal dataFor information on how your personal data is processed  see https://www.euroclear.com/dam/ESwithLegal/Privacy-notice-bolagsstammor-engelska.pdf.________________________Malmö  April 2024Oatly Group AB (publ)Board of directors",neutral,0.05,0.93,0.01,negative,0.01,0.22,0.77,True,English,"['annual general meeting', 'Elite Hotel Savoy', 'Oatly Group AB', 'Norra Vallgatan', 'Wednesday 15 May', 'shareholders', 'Company', 'AGM', 'Malmö', 'Form', '14.', 'Elite Hotel Savoy', 'other authorized depositary', 'other authorization document', 'organization ID number', 'consolidated income statement', 'consolidated balance sheet', 'annual general meeting', 'consolidated annual report', 'Oatly Group AB', 'voting rights registration', 'Euroclear Sweden AB', 'postal voting forms', 'registration certificate', 'voting list', 'postal vote', 'Norra Vallgatan', 'web link', 'share register', 'Record Date', 'custody account', 'business days', 'special form', 'Swedish BankID', 'alternative answers', 'legal entity', 'financial year', 'attorney forms', 'natural persons', 'two persons', 'phone number', 'completed form', 'Nominee-registered shares', 'special instructions', 'Further instructions', 'dated power', 'Wednesday 15 May', 'anmalan.vpc', 'company name', '6 May', '8 May', 'shareholders', 'AGM', 'Malmö', 'clause', 'articles', 'association', 'board', 'directors', 'proxy', 'notice', 'intention', 'heading', 'Notification', 'attendance', 'addition', 'Re-registration', 'advance', 'accordance', 'routines', 'preparation', 'writing', 'Box', 'Stockholm', 'investors', 'corporate-governance', 'personal', 'address', 'representative', 'website', 'mail', 'GeneralMeetingService', 'verification', 'conditions', 'amendments', 'text', 'written', 'secretariat', 'agenda', 'Opening', 'Election', 'chairperson', 'approval', 'minutes', 'Determination', 'Submission', 'auditor', 'Resolution', 'adoption', '09']",2024-04-08,2024-04-09,marketscreener.com
38939,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rferl.org/a/eu-russian-money-arm-ukraine/32895978.html,Wider Europe Briefing: The EU Initiative To Send Russian Money To Ukraine,This week I'm drilling down on two big issues: how the EU could transfer profits from frozen Russian assets to Ukraine -- perhaps as soon as July -- and the challenges NATO faces as it turns 75.,"Welcome to Wider Europe  RFE/RL's newsletter focusing on the key issues concerning the European Union  NATO  and other institutions and their relationships with the Western Balkans and Europe's Eastern neighborhoods.I'm RFE/RL Europe Editor Rikard Jozwiak  and this week I'm drilling down on two big issues: how the EU could transfer profits from frozen Russian assets to Ukraine -- perhaps as soon as July -- and the challenges NATO faces as it turns 75.Brief #1: Will Ukraine Benefit From Russian Assets?What You Need To Know: The European Union is inching closer to a historic decision on using profits from Russian assets frozen by the bloc to help Ukraine. The Russian central bank's assets were frozen shortly after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and have remained so ever since. The securities and cash frozen in the G7  the EU  and Australia are estimated to be worth roughly 260 billion euros ($282 billion). Assets worth an estimated 210 billion euros are in the EU  mostly in Belgium  the home of Euroclear  a user-owned financial services company specializing in securities transactions.In February  the first step by Brussels was completed by setting aside the profits accumulated from the frozen assets. On March 20  the European Commission proposed the initiation of the second and final step -- sending the actual cash to Ukraine. This comes after EU foreign ministers  two days before  tasked EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell with coming up with a proposal for making this happen.None of the 27 member states have objected so far  although it's far from a done deal. Leaders and officials from EU member states still have to study the European Commission's proposal and give it a unanimous green light. Diplomats and officials are expected to start studying the fine print of the text today.Deep Background: The proposal  seen by RFE/RL  notes that the first step of the process  the setting aside of profits  started on February 15 this year: ""the central securities depositories (CSDs) are prohibited from disposing of these profits  or distributing them to shareholders  until the [European] Council decides on the financial contribution to be raised on them to support Ukraine.""CSDs are institutions  such as Euroclear  that hold and administer securities and enable their transactions. The step is thought to have raised something between 2.5 billion and 3 billion euros. The European Commission hopes that this money can be sent to Ukraine by July  provided that member states approve. There are also hopes in Brussels that comparable sums can be sent to Kyiv each year after that  depending on annual interest rates.There are a number of ""assurances"" in Borrell's proposal for member states worried that this move could amount to a seizure of private property -- with private ownership being a fundamental EU right -- or could damage the bloc's common currency  the euro. The document notes that ""the generation of unexpected and extraordinary revenues...are not the property of the Russian central bank as there is no legal or contractual provision for interest to be paid to the owners of the principal.Since these revenues only exist as a result of the restrictive measures  there can also be no legitimate expectation that they should remain with the central securities depositories and their shareholders."" The proposal also added that any retroactive claims by Moscow won't be accepted: ""Unexpected and extraordinary revenues do not have to be made available to the central bank of Russia under applicable rules  even after the discontinuation of the transaction prohibition. Thus  they do not constitute sovereign assets. Therefore  the rules protecting sovereign assets are not applicable to these revenues.""Drilling DownThere are other ""goodies"" to entice member states to quickly come on board with the proposal: an expected 3 percent of the profits from the frozen assets will remain with the CSDs ""to ensure the efficiency of their work."" In the future  the financial services companies will also be able to provisionally retain 10 percent of the profits to cover potential legal fees  as it's highly likely that Russia will take them to court.Several EU officials I have spoken to on background have played down the possibility of damaging the euro's position as the second reserve currency in the world. The fact that Brussels has pondered this move for several months already without any impact on the common currency in terms of trading or value is being cited in support of that argument. Another argument in support of the move is that other G7 countries are also mulling similar moves  so it might not be just the euro that is potentially exposed.Then there is the European Commission's proposal of how the money should be spent  which gives member states even more potential oversight -- and even veto opportunities. Initially  it was thought that the money generated from the profits would go to the reconstruction of Ukraine. But as the war drags on and no one expects widespread reconstruction to start anytime soon  the EU proposal states that 90 percent of the money should go to the supply of military equipment for Kyiv and the remaining 10 percent to regular financial aid.That proposed 10 percent would be channeled via the regular EU budget  so it doesn't need an explicit green light from any member states. But the 90 percent should go via the European Peace Facility (EPF)  an off-EU-budget mechanism that has allowed Brussels to send money to Ukraine for arms purchases. The EU has so far sent 5.6 billion euros ($6.1 billion) for the purchase of arms and artillery to Kyiv over the last two years via EPF but has  for the last 10 months  failed to sign off on a 500 million-euro EPF tranche after a long-standing Hungarian veto. The veto stems from Budapest's dispute with Kyiv over a blacklist produced by Ukraine's National Agency on Corruption Prevention. The Hungarian bank  OTP  is on that blacklist and labeled an ""international sponsor of war"" as it continues to do business in Russia.While the bank was de-listed in the fall  Budapest has sought assurances that it won't happen again in the future  something that so far has not occurred. Recently  the EPF ceiling was raised by 5 billion euros specifically for Ukraine  paving the way for even more EU cash for weapons for Ukraine.But the rules of the game have not changed. This means that national vetoes  such as the Hungarian one  will be a crucial factor for future tranches. And that means the windfall may not end up in Ukraine by the summer after all.Brief #2: NATO at 75 -- Aging But Still Agile?What You Need To Know: On April 4  NATO celebrated 75 years. Manneken Pis  Brussels' iconic fountain statue of a little boy peeing  was decked out in a NATO costume  and the original Washington treaty  which established the military alliance in 1949  was flown to Brussels from the U.S. capital under tight security for the foreign ministers of the 32 NATO allies to admire.But that was about as much fun as the aging military organization could manage for now. The foreign ministers were gathering on April 3-4  about three months before a crucial NATO summit in Washington on July 9-11. And  at their meeting  they dealt with the same issues that member-state leaders will in the summer -- the war in Ukraine and how NATO can shore up its support for Kyiv; Ukraine's prospects of NATO membership; and  finally  who should replace Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg as he bows out after a decade at the helm later this year.No decisions were made by the ministers on any of these issues last week -- a luxury that their bosses  at the July summit  can ill afford.Deep Background: The most pressing issue is military support for Ukraine. With the U.S aid for Ukraine  worth nearly $60 billion  still stuck in Congress  Kyiv's European friends are scrambling to get whatever they can to their outgunned partner amid fears of a Russian offensive in the coming months penetrating Ukrainian defensive lines.Still  the mood is slightly less grim than when I spoke to NATO officials earlier this year. ""It's gloomy at the moment but not catastrophic. Russia is advancing a bit  albeit slowly "" said one diplomat  who was not authorized to speak on the record. Earlier this year  the main issue was how to get artillery shells to Ukraine. While that issue is far from being resolved  NATO members are at least starting to churn them out domestically and procure them around the globe.The glaring problem now is air defenses  especially missiles to protect Ukrainian cities and infrastructure. Unlike shells  missiles are not something that can be easily sourced outside the alliance or produced quickly in member countries. Before the meeting of the foreign ministers  Stoltenberg suggested a solution to the funding issue for the war effort in which NATO would give Ukraine a five-year military-aid package worth up to $100 billion.Under Stoltenberg's plan  the money would be provided by all member states  with contributions based on the countries' gross national income (GNI)  which is used to fund NATO's common budget. The question is whether all members will be on board by July  in time for the summit.Drilling DownThe secretary-general's proposal is very much part of what NATO officials refer to as the ""institutionalization of Ukraine aid."" In essence  this is NATO's attempt to take over various ad hoc initiatives to aid Ukraine. Consider the 50-country Ukraine Defense Contact Group (also known as the Ramstein format)  which is now under U.S. leadership and meets almost monthly to provide Ukraine with arms. Or the F-16 coalition  a group of about a dozen NATO allies training Ukrainian pilots to handle the fighter jet.The military alliance is already facing obstacles  however  with one of them being Hungary. Budapest is against any move that would suggest that NATO is involved in a war  including the military alliance taking over the training of Ukrainian soldiers. There was an aim inside the organization to finalize a draft mandate for a Ukraine mission -- which would take over the various efforts to provide military aid -- at last week's meeting of foreign ministers  but the proposal is far from ready.There has also been little movement on Ukraine's potential membership in NATO. At the alliance's summit in Vilnius last year  it was agreed to do away with the Membership Action Plan (MAP) for Ukraine. The MAP is basically all the necessary political and military reforms that new members have to undertake before joining.But since then  Ukraine's path to possible membership has not been clearer  and there is no timeline. Eastern member states  such as those in the Baltic region  want to go beyond the ""Vilnius language "" but others  such as the United States and Germany  don't. Even if Ukraine did fulfill conditions for membership  such as anti-corruption and security-sector reforms  the elephant in the room is still the war. With almost no appetite for a direct war with Russia  membership is extremely unlikely as long as the fighting continues.That raises many questions: What can NATO offer  if anything  in Washington in July? Some sort of partial membership that only covers the territories that Kyiv has under its political control? Can or even should Kyiv accept such a deal that would de facto partition the country? And will all 32 members of the alliance agree to offer such a thing?And finally  there is the issue of replacing Stoltenberg. This was supposed to be wrapped up in early April with the big four -- France  Germany  the United Kingdom  and the United States -- officially backing outgoing Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte. In fact  most other members also appear to support Rutte's candidacy  including several eastern-flank countries such as Estonia and Poland.Hungary  however  is ardently against the Dutchman while Turkey  for now  is sitting on the fence. Some ministers raised it in Brussels last week and backed Rutte but there is no consensus yet -- plus there is another candidate  Romanian President Klaus Iohannis  who hasn't given up yet. Expect a lot of wheeling and dealing  which will likely drag on well into the summer.Looking AheadThere is expected to be a ruling on April 10 in the European Court of Justice on whether the sanctions against Russian businessmen Petr Aven and Mikhail Fridman should remain in place. In March  the Russian racing driver Nikita Mazepin  son of oligarch Dmitry Mazepin  won his case in the Luxembourg-based court  even though he remains listed for now. The EU can also still challenge the court's decision and present potential new evidence for the sanctions to remain in place.That same day  the European Parliament will debate the recent Russian presidential election  which was without opposition and marred by fraud. Expect the revelation from last week that several European politicians  including some members of the European Parliament  were promoted or even paid by the pro-Russian news portal Voice of Europe to be brought up as well.That's all for this week.

The Russian central bank's assets were frozen shortly after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and have remained so ever since. The securities and cash frozen in the G7  the EU  and Australia are estimated to be worth roughly 260 billion euros ($282 billion). Assets worth an estimated 210 billion euros are in the EU  mostly in Belgium  the home of Euroclear  a user-owned financial services company specializing in securities transactions.In February  the first step by Brussels was completed by setting aside the profits accumulated from the frozen assets. On March 20  the European Commission proposed the initiation of the second and final step -- sending the actual cash to Ukraine. This comes after EU foreign ministers  two days before  tasked EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell with coming up with a proposal for making this happen.None of the 27 member states have objected so far  although it's far from a done deal. Leaders and officials from EU member states still have to study the European Commission's proposal and give it a unanimous green light. Diplomats and officials are expected to start studying the fine print of the text today.Deep Background: The proposal  seen by RFE/RL  notes that the first step of the process  the setting aside of profits  started on February 15 this year: ""the central securities depositories (CSDs) are prohibited from disposing of these profits  or distributing them to shareholders  until the [European] Council decides on the financial contribution to be raised on them to support Ukraine.""CSDs are institutions  such as Euroclear  that hold and administer securities and enable their transactions. The step is thought to have raised something between 2.5 billion and 3 billion euros. The European Commission hopes that this money can be sent to Ukraine by July  provided that member states approve. There are also hopes in Brussels that comparable sums can be sent to Kyiv each year after that  depending on annual interest rates.There are a number of ""assurances"" in Borrell's proposal for member states worried that this move could amount to a seizure of private property -- with private ownership being a fundamental EU right -- or could damage the bloc's common currency  the euro. The document notes that ""the generation of unexpected and extraordinary revenues...are not the property of the Russian central bank as there is no legal or contractual provision for interest to be paid to the owners of the principal.Since these revenues only exist as a result of the restrictive measures  there can also be no legitimate expectation that they should remain with the central securities depositories and their shareholders."" The proposal also added that any retroactive claims by Moscow won't be accepted: ""Unexpected and extraordinary revenues do not have to be made available to the central bank of Russia under applicable rules  even after the discontinuation of the transaction prohibition. Thus  they do not constitute sovereign assets. Therefore  the rules protecting sovereign assets are not applicable to these revenues.""Drilling DownThere are other ""goodies"" to entice member states to quickly come on board with the proposal: an expected 3 percent of the profits from the frozen assets will remain with the CSDs ""to ensure the efficiency of their work."" In the future  the financial services companies will also be able to provisionally retain 10 percent of the profits to cover potential legal fees  as it's highly likely that Russia will take them to court.Several EU officials I have spoken to on background have played down the possibility of damaging the euro's position as the second reserve currency in the world. The fact that Brussels has pondered this move for several months already without any impact on the common currency in terms of trading or value is being cited in support of that argument. Another argument in support of the move is that other G7 countries are also mulling similar moves  so it might not be just the euro that is potentially exposed.Then there is the European Commission's proposal of how the money should be spent  which gives member states even more potential oversight -- and even veto opportunities. Initially  it was thought that the money generated from the profits would go to the reconstruction of Ukraine. But as the war drags on and no one expects widespread reconstruction to start anytime soon  the EU proposal states that 90 percent of the money should go to the supply of military equipment for Kyiv and the remaining 10 percent to regular financial aid.That proposed 10 percent would be channeled via the regular EU budget  so it doesn't need an explicit green light from any member states. But the 90 percent should go via the European Peace Facility (EPF)  an off-EU-budget mechanism that has allowed Brussels to send money to Ukraine for arms purchases. The EU has so far sent 5.6 billion euros ($6.1 billion) for the purchase of arms and artillery to Kyiv over the last two years via EPF but has  for the last 10 months  failed to sign off on a 500 million-euro EPF tranche after a long-standing Hungarian veto. The veto stems from Budapest's dispute with Kyiv over a blacklist produced by Ukraine's National Agency on Corruption Prevention. The Hungarian bank  OTP  is on that blacklist and labeled an ""international sponsor of war"" as it continues to do business in Russia.While the bank was de-listed in the fall  Budapest has sought assurances that it won't happen again in the future  something that so far has not occurred. Recently  the EPF ceiling was raised by 5 billion euros specifically for Ukraine  paving the way for even more EU cash for weapons for Ukraine.But the rules of the game have not changed. This means that national vetoes  such as the Hungarian one  will be a crucial factor for future tranches. And that means the windfall may not end up in Ukraine by the summer after all.By RFE/RLADVERTISEMENTMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",neutral,0.04,0.83,0.14,mixed,0.07,0.3,0.63,True,English,"['Frozen Russian Assets', 'War Effort', 'Ukraine', 'Boost', 'EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell', 'user-owned financial services company', 'The Russian central bank', 'EU foreign ministers', 'financial services companies', 'unanimous green light', 'regular financial aid', 'explicit green light', 'fundamental EU right', 'The European Union', 'other G7 countries', 'European Peace Facility', 'regular EU budget', 'central securities depositories', 'annual interest rates', 'The European Commission', 'potential legal fees', 'second reserve currency', 'EU member states', 'Several EU officials', 'financial contribution', 'Russian assets', 'other ""goodies', 'several months', 'potential oversight', 'budget mechanism', 'common currency', '27 member states', 'historic decision', 'full-scale invasion', 'fine print', 'comparable sums', 'private ownership', 'contractual provision', 'restrictive measures', 'legitimate expectation', 'retroactive claims', 'transaction prohibition', 'similar moves', 'veto opportunities', 'military equipment', 'arms purchases', '260 billion euros', '210 billion euros', '3 billion euros', '5.6 billion euros', 'first step', 'final step', 'EU proposal', 'sovereign assets', 'frozen assets', 'securities transactions', 'actual cash', 'Deep Background', 'private property', 'extraordinary revenues', 'applicable rules', 'widespread reconstruction', 'remaining 10 percent', '2.5 billion', '3 percent', '90 percent', 'profits', 'bloc', 'Ukraine', 'February', 'Australia', 'Belgium', 'home', 'Euroclear', 'Brussels', 'March', 'initiation', 'None', 'deal', 'Leaders', 'Diplomats', 'text', 'RFE/RL', 'process', 'CSDs', 'shareholders', 'institutions', 'something', 'money', 'July', 'hopes', 'Kyiv', 'number', 'assurances', 'seizure', 'document', 'generation', 'unexpected', 'principal', 'result', 'Moscow', 'discontinuation', 'Drilling', 'board', 'efficiency', 'work', 'future', 'court', 'possibility', 'position', 'world', 'fact', 'impact', 'terms', 'trading', 'value', 'support', 'argument', 'war', 'supply', 'EPF']",2024-04-09,2024-04-09,oilprice.com

38945,Deutsche Boerse,NewsApi.org,https://fortune.com/2024/04/08/jpmorgan-ceo-jamie-dimon-compares-ai-electricity-steam-engine-tech-augment-every-job/,JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon compares AI’s potential impact to electricity and the steam engine,The CEO devoted a chunk of his annual shareholder letter to the importance of AI for the Wall Street giant’s business and for society at large.,JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said artificial intelligence may be the biggest issue his bank is grappling with  likened its potential impact to that of the steam engine and said the technology could “augment virtually every job.”The CEO devoted a chunk of his annual shareholder letter to the importance of AI for the Wall Street giant’s business and for society at large. The bank has identified more than 400 use cases for the technology across marketing  fraud and risk  amassed thousands of AI experts and data scientists and begun exploring deploying generative AI  Dimon said.“We are completely convinced the consequences will be extraordinary and possibly as transformational as some of the major technological inventions of the past several hundred years ” Dimon said in the letter. “Think the printing press  the steam engine  electricity  computing and the Internet  among others.”Dimon delivered his verdict on AI’s importance in an expansive dispatch that also lambasted a set of regulatory proposals  sounded a stark warning on geopolitics  took aim at shareholder advisory firms and offered a spirited defense of the role of market making in the financial system. And as expected  the 68-year-old weighed in on the economy  reiterating his concern that risks of persistent inflation  quantitative tightening and the ongoing wars in Ukraine and the Middle East loom large even as the US economy remains robust.“These markets seem to be pricing in at a 70% to 80% chance of a soft landing — modest growth along with declining inflation and interest rates ” Dimon wrote. “I believe the odds are a lot lower than that.”Profit RecordDimon released his letter after JPMorgan notched the highest annual profit in the history of American banking last year. The lender  which reports first-quarter earnings on Friday  benefited from turmoil among regional lenders that began just over a year ago  sending depositors seeking the safety of larger financial institutions. JPMorgan played a major part as those events unfolded  ultimately staging a rescue of First Republic after it failed.The deal “was not something that we would have done just for ourselves ” Dimon wrote. At the time  JPMorgan said the acquisition would add more than $500 million to earnings annually  acknowledging that was probably conservative. In his letter  Dimon said that figure would likely be “closer to $2 billion.”The regional banking turmoil unfolded as regulators put the finishing touches on proposals expected to saddle US banks with tougher capital requirements  known as Basel III Endgame. Dimon  an outspoken critic of the proposals  devoted an entire section of his shareholder letter to what he said was the need for a serious review of the bank regulatory and supervisory process. He also reiterated earlier criticisms about the potential for the proposals to cause economic harm.Market MakingThe proposed rules could also damage market making  where banks help investors buy and sell securities  according to the CEO. Dimon dedicated multiple pages defending the role banks play in that business  which he said some regulators seem to view as speculative  hedge-fund like activity.“This thinking is what might be leading them to constantly increase capital requirements ” he wrote.JPMorgan earns about $100 million in daily revenue from the business  which has only lost money on 30 trading days over the last decade  according to Dimon. The proposed rules  which Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell signaled last month will be scaled back  could harm market stability  Dimon wrote.Proxy VotesDimon also used his letter to take aim at proxy advisers — firms which investors like state pension funds and other big asset managers pay for recommendations on how they should vote their stock on contentious topics such as executive compensation.Dimon has long chided shareholders for casting votes solely based on recommendations from those firms as lazy and irresponsible. But he went a step further on Monday  calling out the two main US advisers  Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis & Co.  for having what he deemed too much sway determining the outcome of shareholder elections.“While asset managers and institutional investors have a fiduciary responsibility to make their own decisions  it is increasingly clear that proxy advisors have undue influence ” Dimon wrote.Dimon over the years has had to fend off a number of resolutions the two firms backed. He noted Monday that ISS is owed by German firm Deutsche Boerse AG  while Canadian private equity firm Peloton Capital owns Glass Lewis  and questioned if American corporate governance should be determined by for-profit institutions with “their own strong feelings about what constitutes good corporate governance.”Dimon also said the bank is taking steps to diminish the role of proxy adviser recommendations. By the end of this year  JPMorgan Asset Management will have largely eliminated third-party proxy adviser voting recommendations from its voting systems  he said. The firm will also work with third-party proxy voting advisers to remove their voting recommendations from research reports they provide to the division by the 2025 proxy season.Other highlights from the letter:,neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,negative,0.03,0.24,0.74,True,English,"['JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon', 'potential impact', 'steam engine', 'AI', 'electricity', 'Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell', 'Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon', 'third-party proxy adviser voting recommendations', 'persistent inflation, quantitative tightening', 'past several hundred years', 'Canadian private equity firm', 'other big asset managers', 'two main US advisers', 'proxy adviser recommendations', 'Wall Street giant', 'Basel III Endgame', 'state pension funds', 'Deutsche Boerse AG', 'good corporate governance', 'highest annual profit', 'major technological inventions', 'American corporate governance', 'Institutional Shareholder Services', 'larger financial institutions', 'tougher capital requirements', 'JPMorgan Asset Management', 'shareholder advisory firms', 'Profit Record Dimon', 'annual shareholder letter', 'regional banking turmoil', 'Proxy Votes Dimon', 'proxy advisers', 'executive compensation', 'voting systems', 'profit institutions', 'declining inflation', 'American banking', 'proxy advisors', 'two firms', 'shareholder elections', 'financial system', 'regional lenders', 'major part', 'German firm', 'Peloton Capital', 'US economy', 'artificial intelligence', 'biggest issue', 'steam engine', '400 use cases', 'data scientists', 'printing press', 'expansive dispatch', 'stark warning', 'spirited defense', 'market making', 'ongoing wars', 'Middle East', '70% to 80% chance', 'soft landing', 'modest growth', 'interest rates', 'First Republic', 'finishing touches', 'US banks', 'outspoken critic', 'entire section', 'serious review', 'supervisory process', 'earlier criticisms', 'economic harm', 'multiple pages', 'daily revenue', '30 trading days', 'last decade', 'market stability', 'contentious topics', 'Glass Lewis', 'fiduciary responsibility', 'undue influence', 'strong feelings', 'institutional investors', 'JPMorgan Chase', 'potential impact', 'AI experts', 'generative AI', 'first-quarter earnings', 'regulatory proposals', 'bank regulatory', 'Co.', 'technology', 'job', 'CEO', 'chunk', 'importance', 'business', 'society', 'marketing', 'fraud', 'risk', 'thousands', 'consequences', 'electricity', 'computing', 'Internet', 'others', 'verdict', 'geopolitics', 'aim', 'role', 'concern', 'Ukraine', 'markets', 'odds', 'history', 'Friday', 'depositors', 'safety', 'events', 'rescue', 'deal', 'something', 'time', 'acquisition', 'figure', 'regulators', 'need', 'rules', 'securities', 'speculative', 'hedge-fund', 'activity', 'thinking', 'money', 'stock', 'shareholders', 'Monday', 'outcome', 'decisions', 'number', 'resolutions', 'steps']",2024-04-08,2024-04-09,fortune.com

38948,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/09/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html,The stock market is shrinking and Jamie Dimon is worried,The number of publicly traded companies in the US is shrinking. Jamie Dimon  one of the world’s most influential business leaders  is worried.,A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business’ Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link.New York CNN —The number of publicly traded companies in the United States is shrinking. Jamie Dimon  one of the world’s most influential business leaders  is worried.At their peak in 1996  there were 7 300 publicly traded companies in the US. Today there are about 4 300.It’s not that America has 40% fewer companies than it did 30 years ago  it’s that companies are increasingly staying private  largely outside the scrutiny of the public eye.“The total should have grown dramatically  not shrunk ” wrote Dimon  CEO of JPMorgan Chase  in his annual shareholder letter on Monday.The PE boom: The shrinking public market has private equity to blame — funds that pool money from investors to acquire or invest in companies.When a PE fund buys a public company  it takes that company private. When it buys a company that isn’t yet public  it is kept that way. That means these funds have complete control over their companies and can encourage them to boost their profits as quickly as possible for a quick sale later down the line.The number of private companies in the US backed by PE firms has grown from 1 900 to 11 200 over the last two decades  according to JPMorgan data.Publicly listed companies are subject to regulatory oversight and disclosure requirements  which help ensure transparency and maintain investor confidence. With fewer companies listed  there may be a decrease in overall transparency and investor trust in the market  said Matthew Kennedy  head of data and content at Renaissance Capital.Additionally  a company owned by PE can obfuscate ownership  what the company actually does and its profit the public and from regulators.Dimon’s company  of course  makes a huge amount of money from taking companies public  so he’s not exactly an impartial observer. But Dimon said his concerns are broader than JPMorgan’s bottom line: If this trend continues  our understanding of the US economy could become hazier  he argued.“This trend is serious ” warned Dimon on Monday. “We really need to consider: Is this the outcome we want?”Intensified reporting requirements  higher litigation expenses  costly regulations  overbearing board governance  shareholder activism  heightened public scrutiny and “the relentless pressure of quarterly earnings ” could be driving companies away from public markets  Dimon said Monday.About those quarterly reports: Earnings season begins in earnest this Friday when JPMorgan Chase reports its results from the first quarter of the year. Dimon doesn’t care for the fanfare.Rarely  however  do we get a behind the scenes of these operations.“There is something very positive about detailed and disciplined quarterly financial and operating reporting ” he said in his note on Monday. “But company CEOs and boards of directors should resist the undue pressure of quarterly earnings  and it is clearly somewhat their fault when they don’t.”Companies that “disappoint” during quarterly earnings face criticism  and new or young CEOs can especially come under pressure after a bad report  said Dimon. This can lead to companies resorting to accounting tricks or disregarding what’s best for a company in the long run to boost their quarterly numbers  he said.Companies might “take short-term actions to increase earnings  such as selling more product cheaply at the end of a quarter  cutting certain investments that may be terrific but can show accounting losses in the first year or two  or just deploying more aggressive accounting methods at times ” he wrote.“Once shortcuts like this begin  people all over the company understand that it is okay to ‘stretch’ to meet your numbers. This could put you on a treadmill to ruin ” he said.Shareholder meetings: Dimon had strong words for activist investors who use shareholder meetings to engage in a campaign to influence corporate actions.He cited “spiraling frivolousness” of the annual shareholder meeting as one of the reasons it’s become less desirable to be a publicly traded company. The event  he said  has “devolved into mostly a showcase of grandstanding and competing special interest groups.”Shareholder activism has been a controversial topic in corporate governance for some time  but has increased in recent years. In 2023  982 companies were subject to activist campaigns globally. That’s a 4% rise compared to a year prior and the highest level since 2019  according to the Harvard Law School Forum on Corporate Governance.An increasing number of US companies are identifying activism as a risk in corporate disclosures  the Forum found. In 2023  more than 23% of Russell 3000 companies (an index that is often used as a stand-in for the entire US market) disclosed shareholder activism as a risk in their annual reporting  up from about 21% a year prior.The rise of proxy advisers: Institutional investors  who have stakes in many companies  rely on proxy advisers — firms that review company data — to guide their voting on corporate decisions due to the challenge of assessing each company themselves.But there are essentially “two main proxy advisers in the United States. One is called Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS)  and the second is called Glass Lewis ” wrote Dimon. ISS is owned by Deutsche Börse  a German company  and Glass Lewis is owned by Peloton Capital  a Canadian private equity firm.“I question whether American corporate governance should be determined by for-profit international institutions that may have their own strong feelings about what constitutes good corporate governance ” wrote Dimon. “While asset managers and institutional investors have a fiduciary responsibility to make their own decisions  it is increasingly clear that proxy advisers have undue influence.”In a statement to CNN  a spokesman for ISS said that its benchmark policy recommended against roughly 13% of all say-on-pay proposals at the top 3 000 US companies but just 2% failed to receive majority support. “Clearly  investors decide themselves how to vote ” he said.“With regard to our independence  ISS and Deutsche Börse in 2021 adopted a Policy on Non-Interference ” he added.Glass Lewis did not immediately respond to CNN’s requests for comment.TL;DR: It’s easier to remain private than to go public  and can also be more lucrative.Over the past 25 years  private equity investments have consistently outperformed global equities  fixed income and small-cap equities by a wide margin  according to a recent Wells Fargo analysis.Now  Dimon is ringing the alarm. If changes aren’t made soon  he warned on Monday  the problem will only get worse.Trump’s net worth has tumbled by $2 billion since Truth Social stock peaked last monthShares of Trump Media & Technology Group continue to rapidly fall back to Earth  reports my colleague Matt Egan.The Truth Social owner dropped by another 8% on Monday  adding to a brutal week that wiped out one-third of the stock’s value.The selloff has shrunk former President Donald Trump’s stake in the controversial company to about $2.9 billion. That’s down sharply from a peak of $5.2 billion  based on the closing high of $66.22 on March 27  the day after it went public.Trump owns a dominant stake of 78.8 million shares in Trump Media  which launched in 2021. Its plan to go public by merging with a shell company was delayed for years by regulatory and legal scrutiny.When Trump Media finally went public late last month  experts immediately warned that Wall Street was drastically overvaluing the company  based on traditional fundamental metrics like revenue and users.Last week  Trump Media disclosed losing $58 million last year on very light revenue of just $4.1 million. By comparison  Twitter (now known as X) generated more than 100 times as much revenue — $665 million — in 2013 ahead of its initial public offering in November of that year.After its first day of trading  Trump Media was valued at as much as $11 billion. That’s almost twice the valuation that Reddit achieved after its IPO in March — even though Reddit generated roughly 200 times as much revenue.Despite the recent losses  shares of Trump Media and the blank check company it merged with have more than doubled this year.Read more here.Biden to give Taiwan’s TSMC $6.6 billion to ramp up US chip productionThe US government plans to give $6.6 billion to the world’s biggest manufacturer of semiconductor chips to help it build three factories in Arizona as part of President Joe Biden’s efforts to secure the supply of advanced chips  report my colleagues Sam Fossum and Anna Cooban.The White House announced Monday that it had signed a non-binding agreement with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) to provide it with the funds for the Phoenix-based fabrication plants  or “fabs ” in addition to roughly $5 billion in government loans.“America invented these chips  but over time  we went from producing nearly 40% of the world’s capacity to close to 10%  and none of the most advanced chips ” Biden said in a statement. “(That exposes) us to significant economic and national security vulnerabilities.”In addition to two previously announced US plants  the Taiwanese chipmaker  which manufactures an estimated 90% of the world’s most advanced chip  said Monday that it would build a third plant  bringing its total investment in Arizona to more than $65 billion.Shares of TSMC closed more than 1% higher on Monday.Read more here.,negative,0.03,0.27,0.7,mixed,0.09,0.33,0.58,True,English,"['stock market', 'Jamie Dimon', 'competing special interest groups', 'Harvard Law School Forum', 'last two decades', 'higher litigation expenses', 'influential business leaders', 'aggressive accounting methods', 'overbearing board governance', 'annual shareholder letter', 'annual shareholder meeting', 'Intensified reporting requirements', 'New York CNN', '7,300 publicly traded companies', 'shrinking public market', 'entire US market', 'CNN Business', 'annual reporting', 'disclosure requirements', 'accounting losses', 'operating reporting', 'corporate governance', 'Shareholder meetings', 'shareholder activism', 'same link', 'United States', 'public eye', 'private equity', 'complete control', 'quick sale', 'regulatory oversight', 'investor confidence', 'investor trust', 'Matthew Kennedy', 'Renaissance Capital', 'huge amount', 'impartial observer', 'costly regulations', 'public markets', 'quarterly reports', 'quarterly financial', 'young CEOs', 'bad report', 'long run', 'short-term actions', 'strong words', 'corporate actions', 'spiraling frivolousness', 'controversial topic', 'recent years', 'activist campaigns', 'highest level', 'corporate disclosures', 'proxy advisers', 'US economy', 'quarterly earnings', 'Earnings season', 'JPMorgan Chase', 'PE boom', 'PE fund', 'PE firms', 'relentless pressure', 'undue pressure', 'activist investors', 'Institutional investors', 'Bell newsletter', 'audio version', 'overall transparency', 'bottom line', 'public scrutiny', 'first quarter', 'quarterly numbers', 'first year', '40% fewer companies', 'private companies', 'Russell 3000 companies', 'many companies', 'increasing number', 'JPMorgan data', 'US companies', 'public company', 'company CEOs', 'Jamie Dimon', '982 companies', 'story', 'subscriber', 'world', 'peak', 'America', 'total', 'Monday', 'funds', 'money', 'profits', 'decrease', 'head', 'content', 'ownership', 'regulators', 'concerns', 'trend', 'understanding', 'outcome', 'earnest', 'results', 'fanfare', 'scenes', 'operations', 'something', 'detailed', 'note', 'boards', 'directors', 'fault', 'criticism', 'tricks', 'investments', 'times', 'shortcuts', 'people', 'treadmill', 'reasons', 'event', 'showcase', 'grandstanding', '4% rise', 'risk', 'index', 'stakes']",2024-04-09,2024-04-09,cnn.com

The MET-C platform enables MaaT Pharma to produce microbiome therapies at a large-scale to meet the needs of larger market indications. The first-in-human study is expected to be initiated in 2025.The data published represents significant advancements in understanding the mechanism of action (MoA) of co-cultured microbiome therapies developed by MaaT Pharma  marking a major step towards clinical evaluation. The results demonstrate that MaaT034 produced key metabolites  recognized as promoting gut barrier restoration and modulating immune responses  such as Short-Chain Fatty Acids (SCFA)  secondary bile acids  and tryptophan derivatives.

(the ""Company""  or ""New Amsterdam Invest""  or ""NAI"")  a commercial real estate company listed on Euronext Amsterdam  announces it rescheduled publication of its audited annual report 2023 to 29 April 2024 and AGM to 21 June 2024.Audited annual report and full results 2023 to be published 29 April 2024Until 2 June 2023 the Company operated as a SPAC and only per that date acquired its operating companies. As a result  it is the first time the Company publishes consolidated annual accounts. It recently appears all parties involved require more time than originally anticipated to finalize the 2023 accounts. The Board of NAI is strongly committed to deliver the market and its investors a comprehensive set of audited accounts and hence rescheduled publication of the 2023 annual report  originally due today  to 29 April 2024.Annual General Meeting scheduled for 21 June 2024Given publication of the AGM agenda and all relevant agenda items are due at least 42 days before an AGM  postponement of the audited annual accounts to 29 April implies that the AGM originally scheduled for 31 May has to be rescheduled. The AGM agenda will be published on 29 April and the new AGM date has been set at 21 June 2024.Outline 2023 resultsNet Rental Income for full year 2023 is consistent with outlook as provided at Half Year 2023 and the Net Result from Operations over 2023 is positive in accordance with written expectations. Given accounting requirements  one-off costs (in connection with the transition from SPAC to operational company) and (non-cash) revaluations of investment property were required  resulting in a 2023 net loss.Outlook 2024For 2024 NAI expects to be profitable and well on track to realize the financial objectives the Company has set out at listing. More specific NAI reiterates that its current portfolio should enable it to realize a 2024 net rental income of approximately €6.9 million and a result before tax of €2.6 million excluding potential impact of revaluation of investment property and or the acquisition of new investment property.Financial Calendar8 April 2024   full year 2023 results update  full year 2023 results update 29 April 2024   D.V.

The MET-C platform enables MaaT Pharma to produce microbiome therapies at a large-scale to meet the needs of larger market indications. The first-in-human study is expected to be initiated in 2025.The data published represents significant advancements in understanding the mechanism of action (MoA) of co-cultured microbiome therapies developed by MaaT Pharma  marking a major step towards clinical evaluation. The results demonstrate that MaaT034 produced key metabolites  recognized as promoting gut barrier restoration and modulating immune responses  such as Short-Chain Fatty Acids (SCFA)  secondary bile acids  and tryptophan derivatives. These findings support the role of MaaT034 in gut barrier repair and in T cell reactivation either in combination with Nivolumab (anti-PD1) or with Atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1). By enhancing gut barrier repair and modulating immune responses  MaaT034 is expected to complement the action of these immunotherapeutic agents  potentially improving their efficacy in treating solid tumors cancer.Data are currently being shared in a poster format at the conference titled  “Evaluation of a new co-cultured microbiome ecosystem therapy candidate (MaaT034) for clinical testing as adjuvant/neoadjuvant to immune checkpoint inhibitors in solid tumors.”About MaaT PharmaMaaT Pharma  a clinical-stage biotechnology company  has established a complete approach to restoring patient-microbiome symbiosis in oncology.

The study randomized a total of 66 postmenopausal women to receive either E4 or placebo over a duration of 6 months.The primary endpoints of the study are skin elasticity and skin roughness  while key secondary endpoints included collagen content  skin hydration  skin thickness  skin dryness  and quality of life. In addition to dermatological efficacy endpoints  the study also collected gynecological/general safety data  such as treatment-emergent adverse events.Collection of top-line results is expected to be completed by the end of 2024  with the final clinical study report (CSR) expected by Q2 2025.""We are excited to have achieved this crucial milestone in our skin study "" said Graham Dixon  Chief Scientific Officer of Mithra. ""The completion of patient randomization signifies a significant step forward in our quest to evaluate the effects of estetrol on skin parameters in postmenopausal women with VMS. While no unexpected safety events have been reported thus far  we continue to prioritize the safety and well-being of our study participants  working closely with our medical monitor to ensure thorough oversight.

(“Pharming” or “the Company”) (EURONEXT Amsterdam: PHARM/Nasdaq: PHAR) announces the completion of patient enrollment in its Phase III clinical trial ( NCT05438407 ) evaluating the investigational drug leniolisib  an oral  selective phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kδ) inhibitor  in children aged 4 to 11 years with activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta syndrome (APDS).Leniolisib  marketed under the brand name Joenja® in the U.S.  received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of APDS in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older in March 2023. Pharming plans to include data from this 4–11-year-old trial in regulatory filings worldwide for the approval of leniolisib for pediatric patients with APDS  beginning in 2025.Anurag Relan  MD  MPH  Chief Medical Officer of Pharming  commented:“This is the first clinical trial for younger pediatric patients with APDS  who have a significant unmet need for a disease modifying treatment. I am pleased with the progress made in our Phase III pediatric clinical program evaluating leniolisib in children with APDS. By intervening at a younger age  we may help prevent patients from developing immune-related complications that are likely to progress throughout their lives.”The study enrolled 21 children with APDS ages 4 to 11 years at sites in the United States  Europe  and Japan. The single-arm  open-label clinical trial is evaluating the safety  tolerability  and efficacy of leniolisib. The study’s primary efficacy endpoints are a reduction in index lymph node size and an increased proportion of naïve B cells out of total B cells from baseline at 12 weeks. Secondary endpoints include an assessment of the ability of leniolisib to modify health-related quality of life based on measures of physical  social  emotional  and school functioning using a validated patient questionnaire. These endpoints mirror those used to evaluate the clinical outcomes in previous leniolisib Phase II/III APDS trials for patients aged 12 and older.The first patient was dosed in November 2023 in a separate Phase III clinical trial that includes children aged 1 to 6 years with APDS to evaluate a new pediatric formulation of leniolisib. Eligible patients enrolled in either of the pediatric trials will continue to receive leniolisib for a year after the initial 12-week treatment period through an open-label extension trial.About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase δ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that was first characterized in 2013. APDS is caused by variants in either one of two identified genes known as PIK3CD or PIK3R1  which are vital to the development and function of immune cells in the body. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3Kδ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway  which causes immune cells to fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation.1 2 3 APDS is characterized by a variety of symptoms  including severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.4 5 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  it has been reported that people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.6 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.4-7 A definitive diagnosis can be made through genetic testing. APDS affects approximately 1 to 2 people per million worldwide.About leniolisibLeniolisib is an oral small molecule phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kẟ) inhibitor approved in the US as the first and only targeted treatment of activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kδ) syndrome (APDS) in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older. Leniolisib inhibits the production of phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate  which serves as an important cellular messenger and regulates a multitude of cell functions such as proliferation  differentiation  cytokine production  cell survival  angiogenesis  and metabolism. Results from a randomized  placebo-controlled Phase II/III clinical trial demonstrated clinical efficacy of leniolisib in the coprimary endpoints; demonstrating statistically significant impact on immune dysregulation and normalization of immunophenotype within these patients  and interim open label extension data has supported the safety and tolerability of long-term leniolisib administration.8 9 Leniolisib is currently under regulatory review in the European Economic Area  Canada  Australia and Israel and a regulatory submission has been made in the U.K.  with plans to pursue regulatory approval in Japan. Leniolisib is also being evaluated in two Phase III clinical trials in children with APDS.About Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V.

These purchase intentions represent annual revenue of over €70 million.Commercial aspect:This plant  mainly dedicated to cosmetics  will be commissioned during 2027 and will market Isonaturane™ 12 and 16  the first natural-origin equivalents to petroleum-based isododecane and isohexadecane. This new industrial facility has been resized to 2 500 tons of isobutene derivatives per year in order to focus on the most profitable markets: make-up and prestige skincare products.Marc Delcourt  Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of Global Bioenergies  explains:""Initially  we aimed at increasing the plant's capacity to 10 000 tons  which required targeting markets such as make-up removers or deodorants. These mass markets demand large volumes at low costs  which would have inevitably driven down our selling prices. By limiting the size of the plant  we are reducing the amount of CAPEX required to build it  and we are targeting markets willing to pay full price for naturalness. The plant's economic profile maintains its margin prospects while reducing the investment required  with purchasing intentions now exceeding the plant's capacity and projected annual sales of over €70 million.In addition to cosmetics  the plant is intended to initiate the Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) market  since the same technology can be used to produce a formulation perfectly usable as aviation fuel  in blends of up to 50% with fossil kerosene. As a reminder  the Company's process is one of the few technologies in the world to benefit from the necessary AS™1 certification  and the Company plans to deploy its process on a large scale in the aviation sector starting from the market opening in 2030  when the threshold for incorporating SAF into kerosene will rise to 6% in the European Union.Industrial aspect:Concurrently with commercial development and under the supervision of Roland Desvignes  Industrial Director of Global Bioenergies  the engineering teams have finalised the first plant layouts. The plant will be divided into five zones: isobutene production by fermentation  purification of isobutene  conversion into isododecane and isohexadecane  effluent management and energy management. Based on these layouts  the total construction cost of the plant (including hazards) has been estimated at nearly €80 million. As a reminder  the French government had already announced its support for the project at the end of 2023 with the allocation of €16.4 million in public aid via the ""First Plant"" call for projects conducted by Bpifrance as part of the France 2030 plan2.The timetable for the design and construction of the plant has also been specified. The so-called ""basic engineering"" phase will be completed at the end of May 2024  and will be followed by a ""front end engineering design"" phase in the second half of 2024. This phase will define all the facilities to be integrated on the selected site. A phase of detailed studies and appraisal of permit applications will begin in early 2025. This will be followed by the construction phase of the plant itself  which will involve the main CAPEX outflows  and will be completed in 2027.About GLOBAL BIOENERGIESGlobal Bioenergies substitutes products of fossil origin with products of natural origin. In their quest for naturalness without compromising on performance  the cosmetics players are the Company's first customers. By 2027  the Company will be operating its innovative process in a large-scale plant. By 2030  the Company plans to become a leader in the huge emerging market for sustainable aviation fuels  in order to fight against global warming.

Recognised as the beating heart of Ireland's social scene  where stories and conversations resound within their walls. Heineken (AS: ) wants to shine a light on their importance by opening virtual Pub Museums across Ireland.This innovative campaign from Heineken ® aims to safeguard historical Irish pubs  advocating for their transformation into museums. Heineken ® has partnered with three distinguished Irish pubs to pioneer the virtual Pub Museum experience. Patrons can now embark on a digital journey through time  exploring the rich history and stories told within these beloved establishments. By scanning a QR code on historical artefacts within the pubs  visitors can unlock a trove of historical facts and stories. Beginning with Toners Pub in Dublin on 5th April  followed by the oldest pub in the world; Sean's Bar in Athlone on 11th April and Mother Macs in Limerick on 18th April.Heineken ® is exploring how these pubs can apply for official Museum accreditation via The Heritage Council in a bid to have them formally recognised as museums. This would offer more opportunities and resources for Irish pubs. By supporting pubs in a bid to become an official museum  Heineken ® aims to preserve pub culture and the future of socialising. The Pub Museum campaign complements the Vintners' Federation of Ireland bid for UNESCO to formally recognise traditional pubs as key elements of Ireland's intangible cultural heritage  highlighting the pub's role in social interaction  music  storytelling and as custodians of local traditions and history.Rachael Crawley  Heineken Ireland commented: Pubs in Ireland play a pivotal role in Irish society and culture  and have done for generations. As a partner of pubs across the country  we've launched the Pub Museums initiative as a way to highlight the historical importance of Irish pubs  and act as a reminder of the importance of these establishments in the fabric of Irish society.Speaking about the initiative  Dublin-based Historian Gerry Farrell commented: Few buildings or businesses maintain the same function over the span of centuries. A visit to a historic public house is a connection back to our own past where generations before  people gathered to talk  drink  eat  sing and play  to flirt and romance  to discuss the great events of the day and set the world to right  to cheer sporting triumph or to drown their sorrows. Irish pubs have been the site for rebellion and betrayal  settings for great literature and places of very real drama. It's important to protect and preserve our historic pubs so that they can continue to be enjoyed for generations to come.Gina O'Kelly  Director  Irish Museums Association added: One of the most interesting aspects of collections is the stories they tell. Objects found within commercial environments  such as our heritage bars and shops  often provide fascinating insights into the daily lives of those from our recent past and their environment: they can reveal information around societal norms  trade activities  the socioeconomic landscape and development of an area  as well as local rituals and cultural practices.Within the Irish Museums Association  we work with many community or volunteer-led organisations that hold collections of this nature and have a deep appreciation of the significance of the objects they hold  particularly within their communities. These serve as tangible reflections of our social history and  through them  we can ground and interconnect our everyday experiences with the layered history of our surroundings  the local communities that inhabit them  and their heritage. Efforts to enhance their preservation  interpretation and display “ thereby making them more publicly accessible “ acknowledge their importance and are warmly welcomed.Editorial information:Please find the high-resolution campaign images and video hereFor more information  please contact: HNKNBrand@edelman.comAbout HEINEKEN:HEINEKEN is the world's most international brewer.

Recognised as the beating heart of Ireland's social scene  where stories and conversations resound within their walls. Heineken wants to shine a light on their importance by opening virtual “Pub Museums” across Ireland.This innovative campaign from Heineken® aims to safeguard historical Irish pubs  advocating for their transformation into museums. Heineken® has partnered with three distinguished Irish pubs to pioneer the virtual Pub Museum experience. Patrons can now embark on a digital journey through time  exploring the rich history and stories told within these beloved establishments. By scanning a QR code on historical artefacts within the pubs  visitors can unlock a trove of historical facts and stories. Beginning with Toners Pub in Dublin on 5th April  followed by the oldest pub in the world; Sean’s Bar in Athlone on 11th April and Mother Macs in Limerick on 18th April.Heineken® is exploring how these pubs can apply for official Museum accreditation via The Heritage Council in a bid to have them formally recognised as museums. This would offer more opportunities and resources for Irish pubs. By supporting pubs in a bid to become an official museum  Heineken® aims to preserve pub culture and the future of socialising. The Pub Museum campaign complements the Vintners’ Federation of Ireland bid for UNESCO to formally recognise traditional pubs as key elements of Ireland's intangible cultural heritage  highlighting the pub's role in social interaction  music  storytelling and as custodians of local traditions and history.Rachael Crawley  Heineken Ireland commented: “Pubs in Ireland play a pivotal role in Irish society and culture  and have done for generations. As a partner of pubs across the country  we’ve launched the Pub Museums initiative as a way to highlight the historical importance of Irish pubs  and act as a reminder of the importance of these establishments in the fabric of Irish society.”Speaking about the initiative  Dublin-based Historian Gerry Farrell commented: “Few buildings or businesses maintain the same function over the span of centuries. A visit to a historic public house is a connection back to our own past where generations before  people gathered to talk  drink  eat  sing and play  to flirt and romance  to discuss the great events of the day and set the world to right  to cheer sporting triumph or to drown their sorrows. Irish pubs have been the site for rebellion and betrayal  settings for great literature and places of very real drama. It’s important to protect and preserve our historic pubs so that they can continue to be enjoyed for generations to come.”Gina O’Kelly  Director  Irish Museums Association added: “One of the most interesting aspects of collections is the stories they tell. Objects found within commercial environments  such as our heritage bars and shops  often provide fascinating insights into the daily lives of those from our recent past and their environment: they can reveal information around societal norms  trade activities  the socioeconomic landscape and development of an area  as well as local rituals and cultural practices.Within the Irish Museums Association  we work with many community or volunteer-led organisations that hold collections of this nature and have a deep appreciation of the significance of the objects they hold  particularly within their communities. These serve as tangible reflections of our social history and  through them  we can ground and interconnect our everyday experiences with the layered history of our surroundings  the local communities that inhabit them  and their heritage. Efforts to enhance their preservation  interpretation and display – thereby making them more publicly accessible – acknowledge their importance and are warmly welcomed.”Editorial information:Please find the high-resolution campaign images and video hereFor more information  please contact: HNKNBrand@edelman.comAbout HEINEKEN:HEINEKEN is the world's most international brewer.

These purchase intentions represent annual revenue of over €70 million.Commercial aspect :This plant  mainly dedicated to cosmetics  will be commissioned during 2027 and will market Isonaturane™ 12 and 16  the first natural-origin equivalents to petroleum-based isododecane and isohexadecane. This new industrial facility has been resized to 2 500 tons of isobutene derivatives per year in order to focus on the most profitable markets: make-up and prestige skincare products.Marc Delcourt  Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of Global Bioenergies  explains:""Initially  we aimed at increasing the plant's capacity to 10 000 tons  which required targeting markets such as make-up removers or deodorants. These mass markets demand large volumes at low costs  which would have inevitably driven down our selling prices. By limiting the size of the plant  we are reducing the amount of CAPEX required to build it  and we are targeting markets willing to pay full price for naturalness. The plant's economic profile maintains its margin prospects while reducing the investment required  with purchasing intentions now exceeding the plant's capacity and projected annual sales of over €70 million.”In addition to cosmetics  the plant is intended to initiate the Sustainable Aviation Fuels (SAF) market  since the same technology can be used to produce a formulation perfectly usable as aviation fuel  in blends of up to 50% with fossil kerosene. As a reminder  the Company's process is one of the few technologies in the world to benefit from the necessary ASTM1 certification  and the Company plans to deploy its process on a large scale in the aviation sector starting from the market opening in 2030  when the threshold for incorporating SAF into kerosene will rise to 6% in the European Union.Industrial aspect :Concurrently with commercial development and under the supervision of Roland Desvignes  Industrial Director of Global Bioenergies  the engineering teams have finalised the first plant layouts. The plant will be divided into five zones: isobutene production by fermentation  purification of isobutene  conversion into isododecane and isohexadecane  effluent management and energy management. Based on these layouts  the total construction cost of the plant (including hazards) has been estimated at nearly €80 million. As a reminder  the French government had already announced its support for the project at the end of 2023 with the allocation of €16.4 million in public aid via the ""First Plant"" call for projects conducted by Bpifrance as part of the France 2030 plan2.The timetable for the design and construction of the plant has also been specified. The so-called ""basic engineering"" phase will be completed at the end of May 2024  and will be followed by a ""front end engineering design"" phase in the second half of 2024. This phase will define all the facilities to be integrated on the selected site. A phase of detailed studies and appraisal of permit applications will begin in early 2025. This will be followed by the construction phase of the plant itself  which will involve the main CAPEX outflows  and will be completed in 2027.About GLOBAL BIOENERGIESGlobal Bioenergies substitutes products of fossil origin with products of natural origin. In their quest for naturalness without compromising on performance  the cosmetics players are the Company's first customers. By 2027  the Company will be operating its innovative process in a large-scale plant. By 2030  the Company plans to become a leader in the huge emerging market for sustainable aviation fuels  in order to fight against global warming.

Amendments to the Articles of Association Proposal to amend the Articles of Association of the Company I It is proposed to amend the Articles of Association of the Company in accordance with the ""proposal for amendment of the Articles of Association I"" that is added to the meeting documents as Annex 4.A in English and Annex 4.B in Dutch. The proposed amendments mainly relate to the implementation of the large company regime (structuurregime) (as referred to in Sections 2:152 up to and including 2:162 and Section 2:164 of the Dutch Civil Code) at the level of the Company. The proposal of the Management Board to amend the Articles of Association in accordance with the ""proposal for amendment of the Articles of Association I"" has been approved by the Supervisory Board. The positive advice of the Works Council with regard to the intended amendment of the Articles of Association in accordance with the ""proposal for amendment of the Articles of Association I"" is available at the Company's website and as Annex 4.Cas part of the meeting documents). It is proposed to the General Meeting of Shareholders to amend the articles of association of the Company in accordance with the ""proposal for amendment of the Articles of Association I"" prepared by Allen & Overy LLP (Amsterdam office)  attorneys-at-law  civil law notaries and tax advisors. The proposal also includes the authorization of the General Counsel of the Company  as well as each civil law notary  deputy civil law notary and notarial assistant of Allen & Overy LLP  each of them severally  to execute the deed of amendment of the articles of association. Proposal to amend the Articles of Association of the Company II The proposed amendment under agenda item 9.B to the articles of association II mainly concerns the introduction of the option to hold a virtual only shareholders' meeting. It is proposed to amend the Articles of Association of the Company in accordance with the ""proposal for amendment of the Articles of Association II"" that is added to the meeting documents as Annex 4.A in English and Annex 4.B in Dutch. The proposed amendments mainly relate to the legislative proposal on the Virtual General Meeting of legal entities under private law (Wet digitale algemene vergadering privaatrechtelijke rechtspersonen). The proposal for the amendment of the Articles of Association entails  in anticipation of the entry into force of the aforementioned legislative proposal and in line with the contents thereof  to include in the Articles of Association of the Company a basis for a virtual general meeting of shareholders. Under current legislation  a fully virtual general meeting is not possible. This means that there must always be a physical place where persons entitled to attend meetings can physically participate in the meeting. However  it is possible to provide in the articles of association that persons entitled to attend the meeting can speak at the general meeting and exercise voting rights by electronic means of communication (e.g. video call). This is a hybrid general meeting  where it is possible both to appear at the physical meeting place and to participate remotely. The Proposal to amend the articles of association of the Company II makes it possible to hold a fully 4virtual general meeting. The Proposal provides for an extra possibility (in addition to the physical and hybrid meeting) for holding a general meeting: the fully virtual meeting. It is only possible to hold fully virtual meetings if the law enters into force and the articles of association provide for this. For now  the principle remains for Alfen that general meetings will be held physically. However for emergency situations or other extreme situations  the Company wants to include this completely virtual format. The virtual-only format may also be chosen for extraordinary general meetings with only a limited number of non-controversial agenda items. However  persons entitled to attend meetings must always have the opportunity to ask questions at a fully virtual general meeting and the board will have to answer these questions to the best of its knowledge. To achieve this  meeting attendees must be able to participate in the general meeting with sound and vision. The use of a ""two-way audiovisual means of communication""  such as video calling  will be mandatory. As is the case under current legislation  those entitled to attend meetings must still be identifiable and able to exercise their voting rights via the electronic means of communication. The proposal of the Management Board to amend the Articles of Association in accordance with the ""proposal for amendment of the Articles of Association II"" has been approved by the Supervisory Board. It is proposed to the General Meeting of Shareholders to amend the articles of association of the Company in accordance with the ""proposal for amendment of the Articles of Association II"" prepared by Allen & Overy LLP (Amsterdam office)  attorneys-at-law  civil law notaries and tax advisors. The proposal also includes the authorization of the General Counsel of the Company  as well as each civil law notary  deputy civil law notary and notarial assistant of Allen & Overy LLP  each of them severally  to execute the deed of amendment of the articles of association. If Proposals 9.A and 9.B are both adopted by the General Meeting of Shareholders  the Company will ask Allen & Overy LLP (Amsterdam office) to execute a notarial deed containing both proposals for amendment of the Articles of Association I and II. 10. Authorities of the Management Board Proposal to extend the designation of the Management Board to issue shares and/or grant rights to subscribe for shares and to limit or exclude pre-emptive rights for a period of 18 months It is proposed to extend the Management Board's authorities for a period of 18 months following the date of this Annual General Meeting of Shareholders  i.e. until and including 9 October 2025  subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board  to issue shares and/or grant rights to subscribe for shares  and to limit or exclude pre-emptive rights of existing shareholders up to a maximum of 10% of the issued share capital on the date of this Annual General Meeting of Shareholders. Consequently  the resolution of last year's Annual General Meeting of Shareholders will lapse. Proposal to authorize the Management Board to cause the Company to acquire own shares for a period of 18 months It is proposed to authorize the Management Board subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board  for a period of 18 months following the date of this Annual General Meeting  i.e. until and including 9 October 2025  to cause the Company to acquire its own shares up to a maximum of 10% of the issued share capital on the date of this Annual General Meeting of Shareholders  either through a purchase on a stock exchange or otherwise at a net price not lower than the nominal value of the shares and not higher than 110% of the stock price. The stock price is defined as the volume-weighted average market price at which shares in the capital of the Company trade on Euronext Amsterdam over the five trading days immediately preceding the day of the purchase or  if higher  on the day of public announcement of the purchase. The proposed authorization will replace the authorization granted to the Management Board on 6 April 2023. 5",neutral,0.01,0.98,0.01,neutral,0.04,0.91,0.05,True,English,"['Alfen N', 'April', '01:06', 'Van der Valk Hotel Almere', 'Mr W.M.

Matthieu Guesné  who launched the green hydrogen business in 2017 ","The founder of French hydrogen firm Lhyfe says his firm has ""bet a lot"" on a promising UK market  having launched North East headquarters.Matthieu Guesné  who launched the green hydrogen business in 2017  says that with the North East as its UK headquarters  the firm is hopeful it can crack a promising market that is already ahead of some European neighbours in terms of subsidies. Lhyfe chose Newcastle as its home in the UK following its €110m IPO on the Euronext Paris exchange in 2022.It has since opened an outpost in Sheffield in a bid to capitalise on the region's research and supply chain prowess. Colin Brown  who leads the UK arm  has previously said the firm is looking at a number of North East sites to host a future green hydrogen production plant.Read more: Shipbuilder A&P Group to close North East yard impacting jobsRead more: North East battery maker plots significant job creation amid growth planResponding to questions from BusinessLive at its latest briefing  Mr Guesné said: ""With our headquarters in Newcastle  we have projects that are really strategic for us. I'm seeing something that is a little bit different in the UK to what I see within the European Union. I see support mechanisms that want to replace natural gas with hydrogen  so we're not talking about replacing grey hydrogen with green hydrogen but replacing natural gas. The ambition there is really big and I think it's really positive because it's really doing the energy transition by replacing a gas with another  which is a nice strategy.""I also see people like Northern Gas Networks who are really believers in green hydrogen and willing to change their assets for hydrogen. And I see people who are working in natural gas  like Centrica  who are willing to develop hydrogen.""Mr Guesné also said he thinks UK regulation is aligned enough with European neighbours such that hydrogen trading could take place. In outlining his hopes for the UK he pointed to the 20GW of offshore wind projects in Scotland which have been granted licences and compared the opportunity to that which Brent oil posed in the 1970s. He said he would like to see depleted wealth in the wake of oil decline replaced with green hydrogen.Lhyfe is already under way with onshore production in Europe but eventually wants to set up offshore production close to wind farms which can provide the renewable electricity to drive the electrolysis process. For that  it has developed the world’s first offshore electrolysis demonstrator - ‘Sealhyfe’ - to show how it can work. That has helped it attract €33m of subsidies from the Belgian Government to create a 10MW project in the North Sea.Overall the firm has a 10GW pipeline across 75 projects and a 1GW deal in the offing with as yet unnamed blue chip partner. It has three production sites in France with eight more either in construction or extension  mainly in France and Germany. The firm has talked of its ambitions to build production in the North East  and the wider UK.Mr Guesné added that he hopes other players similar to Lhyfe enter the market and that his firm is targeting 5% market share. By 2026 the business expects to reach revenues of €100m from a position of €1.3m last year.",neutral,0.32,0.66,0.01,mixed,0.6,0.18,0.22,True,English,"['hydrogen firm', 'promising market', 'Founder', 'Lhyfe', 'UK', 'future green hydrogen production plant', 'Shipbuilder A&P Group', 'first offshore electrolysis demonstrator', 'North East battery maker', 'Euronext Paris exchange', 'supply chain prowess', 'significant job creation', 'blue chip partner', 'three production sites', 'North East sites', 'North East yard', 'Northern Gas Networks', 'North East headquarters', 'offshore wind projects', 'green hydrogen business', 'French hydrogen firm', 'promising UK market', 'offshore production', 'electrolysis process', 'North Sea', 'onshore production', 'promising market', 'wind farms', 'grey hydrogen', 'hydrogen trading', 'Matthieu Guesné', 'European neighbours', '€110m IPO', 'Colin Brown', 'growth plan', 'latest briefing', 'Mr Guesné', 'European Union', 'natural gas', 'energy transition', 'nice strategy', 'Brent oil', 'depleted wealth', 'oil decline', 'renewable electricity', 'Belgian Government', '10MW project', '10GW pipeline', '1GW deal', 'other players', '5% market share', 'UK headquarters', 'UK arm', 'UK regulation', 'wider UK', '75 projects', 'founder', 'Lhyfe', 'lot', 'terms', 'subsidies', 'Newcastle', 'home', 'outpost', 'Sheffield', 'bid', 'region', 'research', 'number', 'jobs', 'questions', 'BusinessLive', 'something', 'support', 'mechanisms', 'ambition', 'people', 'believers', 'assets', 'Centrica', 'place', 'hopes', '20GW', 'Scotland', 'licences', 'opportunity', '1970s', 'wake', 'way', 'world', 'offing', 'unnamed', 'France', 'construction', 'extension', 'Germany', 'revenues', 'position']",2024-04-09,2024-04-09,business-live.co.uk
