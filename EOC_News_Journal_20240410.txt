The Russian central bank's assets were frozen shortly after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and have remained so ever since. The securities and cash frozen in the G7  the EU  and Australia are estimated to be worth roughly 260 billion euros ($282 billion). Assets worth an estimated 210 billion euros are in the EU  mostly in Belgium  the home of Euroclear  a user-owned financial services company specializing in securities transactions.In February  the first step by Brussels was completed by setting aside the profits accumulated from the frozen assets. On March 20  the European Commission proposed the initiation of the second and final step -- sending the actual cash to Ukraine. This comes after EU foreign ministers  two days before  tasked EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell with coming up with a proposal for making this happen.None of the 27 member states have objected so far  although it's far from a done deal. Leaders and officials from EU member states still have to study the European Commission's proposal and give it a unanimous green light. Diplomats and officials are expected to start studying the fine print of the text today.Deep Background: The proposal  seen by RFE/RL  notes that the first step of the process  the setting aside of profits  started on February 15 this year: ""the central securities depositories (CSDs) are prohibited from disposing of these profits  or distributing them to shareholders  until the [European] Council decides on the financial contribution to be raised on them to support Ukraine.""CSDs are institutions  such as Euroclear  that hold and administer securities and enable their transactions. The step is thought to have raised something between 2.5 billion and 3 billion euros. The European Commission hopes that this money can be sent to Ukraine by July  provided that member states approve. There are also hopes in Brussels that comparable sums can be sent to Kyiv each year after that  depending on annual interest rates.There are a number of ""assurances"" in Borrell's proposal for member states worried that this move could amount to a seizure of private property -- with private ownership being a fundamental EU right -- or could damage the bloc's common currency  the euro. The document notes that ""the generation of unexpected and extraordinary revenues...are not the property of the Russian central bank as there is no legal or contractual provision for interest to be paid to the owners of the principal.Since these revenues only exist as a result of the restrictive measures  there can also be no legitimate expectation that they should remain with the central securities depositories and their shareholders."" The proposal also added that any retroactive claims by Moscow won't be accepted: ""Unexpected and extraordinary revenues do not have to be made available to the central bank of Russia under applicable rules  even after the discontinuation of the transaction prohibition. Thus  they do not constitute sovereign assets. Therefore  the rules protecting sovereign assets are not applicable to these revenues.""Drilling DownThere are other ""goodies"" to entice member states to quickly come on board with the proposal: an expected 3 percent of the profits from the frozen assets will remain with the CSDs ""to ensure the efficiency of their work."" In the future  the financial services companies will also be able to provisionally retain 10 percent of the profits to cover potential legal fees  as it's highly likely that Russia will take them to court.Several EU officials I have spoken to on background have played down the possibility of damaging the euro's position as the second reserve currency in the world. The fact that Brussels has pondered this move for several months already without any impact on the common currency in terms of trading or value is being cited in support of that argument. Another argument in support of the move is that other G7 countries are also mulling similar moves  so it might not be just the euro that is potentially exposed.Then there is the European Commission's proposal of how the money should be spent  which gives member states even more potential oversight -- and even veto opportunities. Initially  it was thought that the money generated from the profits would go to the reconstruction of Ukraine. But as the war drags on and no one expects widespread reconstruction to start anytime soon  the EU proposal states that 90 percent of the money should go to the supply of military equipment for Kyiv and the remaining 10 percent to regular financial aid.That proposed 10 percent would be channeled via the regular EU budget  so it doesn't need an explicit green light from any member states. But the 90 percent should go via the European Peace Facility (EPF)  an off-EU-budget mechanism that has allowed Brussels to send money to Ukraine for arms purchases. The EU has so far sent 5.6 billion euros ($6.1 billion) for the purchase of arms and artillery to Kyiv over the last two years via EPF but has  for the last 10 months  failed to sign off on a 500 million-euro EPF tranche after a long-standing Hungarian veto. The veto stems from Budapest's dispute with Kyiv over a blacklist produced by Ukraine's National Agency on Corruption Prevention. The Hungarian bank  OTP  is on that blacklist and labeled an ""international sponsor of war"" as it continues to do business in Russia.While the bank was de-listed in the fall  Budapest has sought assurances that it won't happen again in the future  something that so far has not occurred. Recently  the EPF ceiling was raised by 5 billion euros specifically for Ukraine  paving the way for even more EU cash for weapons for Ukraine.But the rules of the game have not changed. This means that national vetoes  such as the Hungarian one  will be a crucial factor for future tranches. And that means the windfall may not end up in Ukraine by the summer after all.By RFE/RLADVERTISEMENTMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",neutral,0.04,0.83,0.14,mixed,0.07,0.3,0.63,True,English,"['Frozen Russian Assets', 'War Effort', 'Ukraine', 'Boost', 'EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell', 'user-owned financial services company', 'The Russian central bank', 'EU foreign ministers', 'financial services companies', 'unanimous green light', 'regular financial aid', 'explicit green light', 'fundamental EU right', 'The European Union', 'other G7 countries', 'European Peace Facility', 'regular EU budget', 'central securities depositories', 'annual interest rates', 'The European Commission', 'potential legal fees', 'second reserve currency', 'EU member states', 'Several EU officials', 'financial contribution', 'Russian assets', 'other ""goodies', 'several months', 'potential oversight', 'budget mechanism', 'common currency', '27 member states', 'historic decision', 'full-scale invasion', 'fine print', 'comparable sums', 'private ownership', 'contractual provision', 'restrictive measures', 'legitimate expectation', 'retroactive claims', 'transaction prohibition', 'similar moves', 'veto opportunities', 'military equipment', 'arms purchases', '260 billion euros', '210 billion euros', '3 billion euros', '5.6 billion euros', 'first step', 'final step', 'EU proposal', 'sovereign assets', 'frozen assets', 'securities transactions', 'actual cash', 'Deep Background', 'private property', 'extraordinary revenues', 'applicable rules', 'widespread reconstruction', 'remaining 10 percent', '2.5 billion', '3 percent', '90 percent', 'profits', 'bloc', 'Ukraine', 'February', 'Australia', 'Belgium', 'home', 'Euroclear', 'Brussels', 'March', 'initiation', 'None', 'deal', 'Leaders', 'Diplomats', 'text', 'RFE/RL', 'process', 'CSDs', 'shareholders', 'institutions', 'something', 'money', 'July', 'hopes', 'Kyiv', 'number', 'assurances', 'seizure', 'document', 'generation', 'unexpected', 'principal', 'result', 'Moscow', 'discontinuation', 'Drilling', 'board', 'efficiency', 'work', 'future', 'court', 'possibility', 'position', 'world', 'fact', 'impact', 'terms', 'trading', 'value', 'support', 'argument', 'war', 'supply', 'EPF']",2024-04-09,2024-04-10,oilprice.com

Item 15 - The proposal by the board of directors regarding share split and automatic share redemption program  including (a) share split 2:1  (b) reduction of the share capital through redemption of shares  and (c) increase of the share capital through a bonus issue without issuance of new shares The board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves on a so-called automatic share redemption program  encompassing a distribution to the shareholders of a total of SEK 3 per existing share according to items 15(a) - 15(c) below. The resolutions of the annual general meeting according to items 15(a) - 15(c) shall be taken together as one resolution. (a) Resolution on share split 2:1: The board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves on a share split  whereby one (1) existing share in the company is split into two (2) shares  of which one will be a so-called redemption share. The board proposes that the board be authorized to determine the record date for the split of shares  which at the time of the notice is estimated to be Tuesday  May 28  2024. Based on such estimated record date for the split of shares  the last day for trading in the Björn Borg share including the right to receive redemption shares to fall on Friday 24 May 2024 and the first day of trading in the Björn Borg share excluding the right to redemption shares to fall on Monday 27 May 2024. (b) Resolution on reduction of the share capital through redemption of shares: The board proposes that the annual general meeting decide that the share capital should be reduced for repayment to the shareholders by SEK 75 445 152 through the withdrawal of 25 148 384 shares. The shares that are withdrawn must consist of the shares that  after the share split has been carried out as above  are called redemption shares. Payment for each redemption share shall be SEK 3 (of which approximately SEK 2.84 exceeds the share's quota value after the share split as above). The total redemption proceeds therefore amount to SEK 75 445 152. The board further proposes that the board be authorized to determine the record date for the right to receive the redemption proceeds  which at the time of the notice is estimated to be Monday  June 17  2024. Payment of the redemption proceeds is expected to be executed by Euroclear Sweden AB on Thursday  June 20  2024. The company's share capital will be completed reduction of the share capital to amount to SEK 3 929 435  distributed over 25 148 384 shares  each with a quota value of SEK 0.15625. In addition to the reduction of the share capital  the company's own restricted capital will not be affected. Statements and reports from the board and the auditor will be provided and presented at the annual general meeting  see under Documents below. (c) Resolution on increase of the share capital through a bonus issue without issuance of new shares: In order to achieve a time-efficient redemption procedure  without having to obtain permission from the Swedish Companies Registration Office (Sw. Bolagsverket) or a court  the board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to  through a bonus issue  restore the company's share capital to its original level  SEK 7 858 870 by increasing the company's share capital with SEK 3 929 435 through a transfer from the company's unrestricted equity to the company's share capital. No new shares will be issued in connection with the share capital increase. The quota value of the share will  after the bonus issue  amount to its original level  SEK 0.3125. The board of directors further proposes that the board of directors  or other person appointed by the board of directors  shall be authorized to make such minor amendments in the resolutions of the annual general meeting in (a)-(c) that may be necessary in order to effect the registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office. A special information brochure on the automatic procedure  which contains information on trading in redemption shares  etc.  will be provided  see under Documents below. Item 16 - The proposal by the board of directors to authorize the board of directors to resolve on new issues of shares  warrants and/or convertibles The board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting authorizes the board of directors  until the next annual general meeting  on one or several occasions  with or without deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  to resolve on new issues of shares  warrants and/or convertibles. Resolutions that are passed under the authorization may not  in the aggregate  involve an increase of the share capital by more than SEK 390 625 (distributed on not more than 1 250 000 new shares). The authorization shall also include the right to resolve on new issues where the shares are to be paid for with non-cash consideration or through set-off of a claim  or otherwise with terms and conditions pursuant to the Swedish Companies Act (2005:551) Chapter 13 Section 7  Chapter 14 Section 9  or Chapter 15 Section 9. The reasons for deviating from the shareholders' preferential right may be that possible targeted issues for the implementation of acquisitions of all or parts of other companies or operations  alternatively for the acquisition of capital to be used for such acquisitions. When using the authorization  the assessment made in connection with deviation from the shareholders' preferential right must be reported. The basis for the issue price shall be the share's market value. When using the authorization  the assessment made in this regard must also be reported. The board of directors further proposes that the board of directors  or other person appointed by the board of directors  shall be authorized to make such minor amendments in the resolution of the annual general meeting that may be necessary in order to effect the registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office. Item 17 - The board's proposal for authorization regarding the acquisition and transfer of own shares The board proposes that the annual general meeting decide that the board is authorized to decide on the acquisition of the company's own shares as follows: 1. Acquisitions may take place during the period until the next annual general meeting  on one or more occasions. 2. Acquisitions may be made of a maximum of so many shares that the company's holding of own shares at any time does not exceed 10 percent of all shares in the company. 3. Acquisitions must take place on Nasdaq Stockholm within the price range applicable at any given time. 4. The board must be able to decide that the buyback of own shares must take place within the framework of a buyback program in accordance with Article 5 of the EU's market abuse regulation and the Commission's delegated regulation (EU) 2016/1052 (the so-called safe harbor regulation). The board further proposes that the annual general meeting authorizes the board to  in the period until the next annual general meeting  transfer own shares held by the company as liquid in connection with the acquisition of a company or business or to finance such an acquisition  whereby sales may also take place on Nasdaq Stockholm. Otherwise  the following conditions shall apply: 1. The authorization may be used during the period until the next annual general meeting  on one or more occasions. 2. Transfer may take place of all own shares in the company that the company holds at the time of the board's decision. 3. The authorization includes the right to decide on a deviation from the shareholders' preferential right. 4. Transfers on Nasdaq Stockholm must take place within the price range applicable at any given time. In the case of transfers outside Nasdaq Stockholm  payment for the shares must be made in cash  with property in kind or by set-off and the price must correspond to an assessed market value at the time of the transfer. The purpose of the authorizations for the repurchase and transfer of own shares  and the reason for the deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive right  is to give the company the opportunity to use own shares to finance or pay acquisitions of companies or businesses without delay and in a flexible and cost-effective way. The purpose of the authorization to buy back own shares is also to give the board the opportunity to adjust the company's capital structure in order to thereby create increased value for the shareholder. Item 18 - The board's proposal regarding guidelines for remuneration to the executive management The incentive programme in brief GeneralThe board of directors proposes the following guidelines for remuneration to the executive management. With the exception of certain changes in wording due to the equity-based incentive program that was introduced after the 2023 Annual General Meeting  as well as an adjustment to the cap on fee-based pension  the Board's proposal is essentially unchanged from the guidelines that were adopted at the 2020 Annual General Meeting. There have been no comments from shareholders on the previous guidelines. The term executive management refers to the managing director and the other members of the group management team. The guidelines shall apply to remuneration as agreed upon  and changes made to agreed remuneration  after the guidelines have been adopted by the annual general meeting 2024. These guidelines do not include remuneration that has been decided by the annual general meeting. The company's business strategy in brief is to create a sports fashion brand while expanding the underwear business and thereby achieve the company's financial goals. For further information on the company's business strategy  see https://corporate.bjornborg.com/en/vision-business-concept-and-strategy/. The successful implementation of the company's business strategy and safeguarding of the company's long-term interests  including with regard to sustainability  requires the company to be able to recruit and retain a highly competent management with the capacity to achieve the stated goals. The forms of remuneration shall therefore be competitive and incentivize the group management team to do their utmost to ensure the company's positive financial development. With regard to the long-term incentive program for the company's management (LTIP 2023/2026) that was adopted at the 2023 Annual General Meeting  and which is therefore not covered by these guidelines  more information is available at https://corporate.bjornborg.com/en/ersattningar/. LTIP 2023/2026 is an equity-based program through which senior executives and other key personnel have acquired warrants issued by Björn Borg. For employment relationships subject to rules other than those in Sweden  the necessary adjustments may be made to comply with mandatory rules or local practices while fulfilling the overarching purpose of these guidelines as far as possible. Forms of remuneration  etc.Compensation for the CEO and the other members of the Group Management Team may consist of fixed salary  variable compensation  pension  and other benefits. The total compensation should be market-based and competitive and be in relation to responsibility and authority. The Annual General Meeting may  in addition and independently of these guidelines  decide on stock- and stock-price-related compensation (such as the aforementioned LTIP 2023/2026). The fulfilment of the criteria for payment of variable remuneration is measured over a period of one or more years (normally one year). The variable remuneration may not exceed 50 per cent of the fixed salary during the measurement period. Additional variable remuneration may be paid in extraordinary circumstances  provided that such extraordinary arrangements are limited in time and only made on an individual level either to recruit or retain senior executives  or as remuneration for extraordinary efforts over and above the person's ordinary duties. Such remuneration may not exceed the equivalent of 20 per cent of the fixed annual salary and may not be paid out more than once per year per individual. Decisions on such remuneration shall be made by the board of directors based on the proposal of the remuneration committee. Pension benefits for the managing director  including medical insurance  shall be defined-contribution. Variable remuneration shall not be pensionable. The pension premiums for the defined-contribution pension shall not exceed 30 per cent of the fixed annual salary. For other members of executive management  pension benefits  including medical insurance  shall be defined-contribution unless the executive is entitled to a defined-benefit pension according to the provisions of a mandatory collective agreement. Variable remuneration shall be pensionable to the extent required by the provisions of any mandatory collective agreement that applies to the executive. The pension premiums for the defined-contribution pension shall not exceed 30 per cent of the fixed annual salary. Other benefits may include life insurance  medical insurance and a company car. Premiums and other costs associated with such benefits in total may not exceed 20 per cent of the fixed annual salary. Criteria for payment of variable remunerationThe variable remuneration shall be based on the result  measured in relation to defined and measurable targets  tailored to contribute to the company's business strategy and long-term value  including sustainability  e.g. by having a clear connection to the business strategy or promoting the executive's long-term development.The criteria for payment of variable remuneration within the Björn Borg Group are mainly the fulfilment of defined targets related to the company's total sales and EBIT  which shall be the base for 60-70 per cent of the total variable remuneration. The remaining criteria relate to fulfilment of individual goals for each executive  such as for example function specific project goals and goals related to margin and growth determined by applying Björn Borg's business strategy  long-term interest and/or sustainability initiatives to each executive's area of responsibility. When the current measurement period for fulfilling the criteria for variable remuneration has concluded  the remuneration committee  as regards remuneration to the managing director  and the managing director together with the remuneration committee  as regards remuneration to other members of executive management  shall evaluate to what degree the criteria have been fulfilled. The board of directors shall  based on the proposal by the managing director and the remuneration committee  decide on payment of variable remuneration. The board of directors shall  when determining the variable remuneration to the executive management  also consider whether to introduce restrictions which (i) make it a condition for part of the variable remuneration that the performance on which the remuneration is based proves to be sustainable over time  and (ii) entitle the company to recover remuneration which has been paid out due to information that later proves to be obviously incorrect. The board of directors shall also periodically determine whether there is reason to cite such conditions or exercise the option  by law or agreement  to recover paid-out remuneration. Termination of employmentIn the event of termination of employment initiated by the company  the notice period shall not be longer than six months. Upon termination on the executive's initiative  the notice period shall not be longer than six months. Severance pay shall not be applied. Remuneration may be paid for non-compete undertakings. Such remuneration shall only compensate for loss of income due to the non-compete undertaking and shall be based on the fixed compensation of the executive at the time of termination of employment. Such compensation shall only be paid in so far as the previously employed executive is not entitled to severance pay.Salary and terms of employmentIn preparing the board of directors' proposal of these remuneration guidelines  the salary and employment terms for the company's employees have been taken into account by making information on employees' total remuneration  the remuneration's components and the remuneration's increase and rate of increase over time  part of the remuneration committee's and the board of directors' decision support for evaluating the fairness of the guidelines and the limitations thereof. Decision-making process to determine  review and implement the guidelinesThe board of directors has established a remuneration committee to among other things prepare the board of directors' decision on the proposed guidelines for remuneration to executive management. The board of directors shall prepare a proposal for new guidelines at least every four years and present proposals for the decision at the annual general meeting. The guidelines shall apply until new guidelines have been adopted by the annual general meeting. The remuneration committee shall also monitor and evaluate variable remuneration programmes for the company's management  the application of the remuneration guidelines for executive management  and current remuneration structures and remuneration levels in the company. It is also the remuneration committee's responsibility to prepare the board of directors' decision on any exceptions from these guidelines. The managing director or other individuals in the company's management shall not be present during the board of directors' evaluation of and decision on remuneration related questions to the extent they are affected by the questions. Deviations from the guidelinesThe board of directors may deviate from these guidelines in individual cases where there are specific reasons for this and where an exception is necessary to serve the company's long-term interests  including sustainability  or to ensure the company's economic viability. Item 19 - Presentation and approval of the remuneration report The board of directors has prepared a remuneration report for 2024 and proposes that the annual general meeting approves the report.

The guidelines shall apply to remuneration already agreed upon  and changes to already agreed remuneration  after the guidelines have been adopted. The guidelines do not cover remuneration resolved by the general meeting.The guidelines' promotion of the Company's business strategy  long-term interests and sustainabilityThe Company's business strategy is to use its experience  expertise and a widespread network to identify and invest in assets with considerable potential for value appreciation. The sector mandate is broad and the proposition is to create shareholder value by investing in assets that are associated with risks which VNV Global is well-equipped to manage. Such typical risks include corporate governance risks  liquidity risks and operational risks.For more information regarding the Company's business strategy  please see www.vnv.global.A prerequisite for the successful implementation of the Company's business strategy and safeguarding of its long-term interests  including its sustainability  is the Company's ability to recruit and retain qualified personnel. To this end  it is necessary that the Company offers competitive remuneration. These guidelines enable the Company to offer the management team a competitive total remuneration.Long-term share-related incentive programs have been implemented in the Company. Such programs have been resolved by the general meeting and are therefore excluded from these guidelines. The long-term share incentive plan proposed by the board of directors and submitted to the annual general meeting 2024 for approval is excluded for the same reason. The proposed plan is based on the structure of the long-term share incentive plan from 2023  specifically the Class C 2023 Shares  with some changes  mainly in the criteria for measuring performance and the payout structure. The programs include all permanent employees of the Company. The performance criteria used to assess the outcome of the programs are distinctly linked lo the business strategy and thereby to the Company's long-term value creation  including its sustainability. At present  these performance criteria comprise i) average annual development of VNV Global's net asset value  and ii) total return of VNV Global's share over the lifetime of the programs  subject to market-based adjustments. The programs are further conditional upon the participant's own investment and holding periods of several years. For more information regarding the programs  including the criteria on which the outcome depends  please see VNV Global's annual report for the financial year 2023  note 19 to the financial statements.Variable cash remuneration covered by these guidelines shall aim at promoting the Company's business strategy and long-term interests  including its sustainability.Remuneration to the members of the management teamTypes of remuneration  etc.The remuneration shall be on market terms and may consist of the following components: fixed cash salary  variable cash remuneration  pension benefits and other benefits.

As set out above  the remuneration committee's tasks include preparing the board of directors' resolutions in remuneration-related matters. This includes any resolutions to derogate from the guidelines.Description of material changes to the guidelinesThe amendments to the guidelines proposed above mainly concern that any relevant ESG matters shall be taken into account when determining outcomes of variable cash remuneration.Resolution regarding amendment of the Company's articles of association (item 16)The Board of Directors proposes that the Meeting resolves to amend the Articles of Association  entailing that provisions regarding shares of Class C 2019  Class C 2020 and Class C 2021 are removed  due to the fact that all shares of such share classes have been redeemed. The Board's complete proposal regarding articles of association after these amendments as well as the amendments in accordance with item 17(b) is set out in Appendix A to this notice.Resolution on LTIP  LTIP 2024 (item 17)The Board proposes a long-term share incentive plan (""LTIP 2024"") in the Company in accordance with the below. LTIP 2024 is a five-year performance-based incentive program and is based on the structure of the long-term share incentive plan from 2023  specifically the Class C 2023 Shares  with some changes  mainly in the criteria for measuring performance and the payout structure as set out in the detailed description of the program below.The objective of LTIP 2024 is to encourage the employees to financially commit to the long-term value growth of VNV Global  and thereby align their interests with those of the shareholders. LTIP 2024 will be an important tool for VNV Global to retain the best talent for the Company  which is vital for the ability to provide long-term value growth for its shareholders.LTIP 2024 requires that the Meeting  in addition to adopting the new LTIP 2024  resolves (i) to adopt certain amendments to the articles of association of the Company (the ""New Articles"") and (ii) on an issuance of Class C 2024 Shares (defined below) to the participants in LTIP 2024  in accordance with the Board's proposals for the Meeting in items 17(b) and 17(c) below.Adoption of LTIP 2024 (item 17(a))Summary of LTIP 2024Management and certain key employees of VNV Global will be invited to participate in LTIP 2024. Participation requires a personal investment in VNV Global's ordinary shares (""Investment Shares""). The size of the personal investment  i.e. the number of Investment Shares that the participant is required to buy  is dependent on the participation allocation of each participant  as determined by the Board.Based on the participation allocation  the participant will receive reclassifiable  sub-ordinated  incentive shares  Class C 2024 Shares (""Incentive Shares""). At the end of the program period  such Incentive Shares will be reclassified into ordinary shares in the Company (""Ordinary Shares"") or redeemed  depending on to what extent the performance condition has been met. Incentive Shares may also be redeemed in other situations  such as termination of the participant's employment  as set out in the detailed terms below.Detailed terms and description of LTIP 2024Participants in LTIP 2024Seven (7) employees in VNV Global will be entitled to participate in LTIP 2024.Personal investment conditionIn order to participate in LTIP 2024  the participants are required to make a personal investment in Investment Shares  directly or indirectly  when giving notice of their participation in LTIP 2024. The Investment Shares may be either Ordinary Shares acquired specifically for LTIP 2024 or Ordinary Shares the employee already own (which are not already allocated to other incentive programs of the Company).The Investment Shares shall be acquired no later than 31 December 2024. The Investment Shares must be retained during the Measurement Period (defined below).Performance condition and Measurement PeriodThe number of Incentive Shares that shall be reclassified into Ordinary Shares is based on the level of fulfilment of the performance condition measured over 1 April 2024 - 31 March 2029  where the start value shall be based on the average closing price for the Ordinary Shares during February and March 2024 and the end value shall be based on the average closing price for Ordinary Shares during February and March 2029 (the ""Measurement Period"").The performance condition is based on the measurement of VNV Global's average annual total shareholder return (""TSR"") during the Measurement Period. The performance condition has a minimum performance level of 10 percent TSR (""Entry Level"") and a maximum performance level of 25 percent TSR (""Stretch Level"").• If the Entry Level is reached at the end of the Measurement Period  20 percent of the Incentive Shares will be reclassified into Ordinary Shares.• If the Stretch Level is reached at the end of the Measurement Period  100 percent of the Incentive Shares will be reclassified into Ordinary Shares.• If the TSR at the end of the Measurement Period is between the Entry Level and Stretch Level  between 20-100 percent of the Incentive Shares will be reclassified into Ordinary Shares on a linear basis.The Incentive Shares that are not reclassified into Ordinary Shares will be redeemed by VNV Global after the Measurement Period.See the New Articles for more information regarding the performance condition.Vesting period - employment conditionReclassification of the Incentive Shares into Ordinary Shares requires that the participant is employed by the VNV Global group (or any associated company as decided by the Board from time to time)  throughout a five-year vesting period  ending after release of VNV Global's interim financial report for the period January-March 2029 (the ""Vesting Period"")  whereby (i) 60 percent of the Investment Shares shall vest after the disclosure of VNV Global's interim financial report for the period January - March 2027  (ii) 20 percent of the Investment Shares shall vest after the disclosure of VNV Global's interim financial report for the period January - March 2028  and (iii) 20 percent of the investment Shares shall vest after the disclosure of VNV Global's interim financial report for the period January - March 2029.General terms and conditions for LTIP 2024The Incentive Shares shall be governed by the New Articles. Allocation of Incentive Shares is also conditional upon the participants entering into agreements regarding LTIP 2024 (the ""Participation Agreement"").The main terms and conditions for LTIP 2024 are the following:• The participants  directly or indirectly  will be entitled to subscribe for Incentive Shares for SEK 0.1016 per Incentive Share (i.e. the quota value of the Company's shares).• If and to the extent the performance condition for reclassification of the Incentive Shares has been fulfilled  the Incentive Shares will be reclassified into Ordinary Shares after the Measurement Period. Upon reclassification  one (1) Incentive Share will be reclassified to one (1) Ordinary Share.• To the extent that the performance condition for reclassification of the Incentive Share has not been fulfilled  the Incentive Shares will be redeemed by VNV Global after the Measurement Period. In addition  the Board has the right to redeem Incentive Shares at any time if redemption is requested by the participant.• In order to align the participants' and shareholders' interests  the participants will be compensated for dividends and other value transfers to the shareholders during the Measurement Period. However  such compensation will be paid only if and to the extent the performance condition for reclassification of the Incentive Shares have been fulfilled. In order for such compensation to be linked to the long-term value growth in the VNV Global share  the Board believes that the compensation in LTIP 2024 shall in the first instance be paid with own VNV Global ordinary shares  if possible. The TSR shall also be adjusted for cash dividends  dividends in kind and mandatory share redemption proceeds and corrected for dilutive effects of any share issues. Further  the number of Incentive Shares may change during the Measurement Period due to intervening bonus issues  reverse splits  splits  rights issues and/or other similar events.• The Participation Agreements will include an irrevocable request from the participant to redeem the participant's Incentive Shares (all or a portion as the case may be):a) all if the participant has not allocated the committed Investment Shares at the latest on 31 December 2024;b) all if the participant transfers  sells  pledges  lends or otherwise disposes of the Investment Shares during the Measurement Period;c) all if the participant transfers  sells  pledges  lends or otherwise disposes of the Incentive Shares at any time prior to reclassification to Ordinary Shares;d) all or a portion  as the case may be  if the participant ceases to be employed by the VNV Global group  during the Vesting Period  other than in the event of death  disability or retirement; ore) in case a redemption is necessary to ensure that LTIP 2024 is compliant with laws and regulations.The Board may decide to waive the redemption requirement in any particular case.• VNV Global has a right to reclaim the subsidy (see below)  if the participant transfers the Incentive Shares prior to reclassification or redemption of the Incentive Shares.Participation AllocationFor each Investment Share allocated to LTIP 2024  the participant will be allocated 50 Incentive Shares. LTIP 2024 is proposed to comprise up to 26 000 Investment Shares entitling participants to subscribe for  in aggregate  up to 1 300 000 Incentive Shares  divided between the following categories of participants:Participant Investment Shares Incentive Shares CEO 13 000 650 000 Other members of management team and key employees 13 000 650 000The Board will determine the final allocation to each participant based on competence and area of responsibility. The Board may decide to decrease the allocation to the CEO and direct a portion of his allocation to other members of management and key employees.Class C 2024 Shares and reclassification into Ordinary SharesA new share class in VNV Global. Class C 2024 Shares (i.e. the Incentive Shares)  is proposed to be introduced in accordance with the New Articles.According to the New Articles  the Incentive Shares  under certain conditions  will be reclassified into Ordinary Shares  which following registration will be admitted to trading on the marketplace where the Ordinary Shares are admitted to trading.Reclassification of the Incentive Shares into Ordinary Shares will be made after the Measurement Period. The maximum number of Incentive Shares that can be reclassified amounts to 1 300 000. Maximum outcome assumes full participation in LTIP 2024  no personnel turn-over during the Vesting Period  and that the performance condition has been fully met during the Measurement Period (i.e. that the Stretch Level has been achieved).See the New Articles for more information regarding reclassification conditions.Information about the outcome of LTIP 2024 will be presented in the Annual Report for 2029.Subsidy of tax impactVNV Global will grant a cash subsidy to the participants in LTIP 2024 to compensate for the tax impact arising due to the fact that the subscription price for the Incentive Shares is below fair market value of the Incentive Shares (see below under the heading ""Cost  scope and effects on key ratios""). The cash subsidy will correspond to  and cover  the tax impact for the participant and may also cover the subscription price for the Incentive Shares.Costs  scope and effects on key ratiosThe Incentive Shares are valued using the Monte Carlo method. The valuation has been made by the Company  using its own input parameters in a model provided by an independent valuation institute (PwC). Based on a price for the Ordinary Share of SEK 20.40 and the market conditions that prevailed on 2 April 2024  the value per Incentive Share has been estimated to be SEK 4.83.Based on the assumption of full participation in LTIP 2024 (i.e. 1 300 000 Incentive Shares) and a total fair market value of the Incentive Shares of SEK 6.28 million (based on an estimated value per Incentive Share of SEK 4.83)  the total cost for LTIP 2024  including social security costs  is estimated to amount to approximately SEK 15.93 million.Given that the actual cost for VNV Global will be based on the prevailing price of the Ordinary Shares in connection with subscription of the Incentive Shares  VNV Global's costs may deviate from the estimates set out above.The maximum dilution due to LTIP 2024 is no more than 1.0 percent in terms of outstanding Ordinary Shares at the time of issuance. The number of Incentive Shares may change during the Measurement Period due to intervening bonus issues  reverse splits  splits  rights issues and/or other similar events.The costs and dilution are expected to have a marginal effect on VNV Global's key ratios.Preparation and administrationThe Board has prepared LTIP 2024 in consultation with external advisors during the first quarter 2024.The Board shall be responsible for preparing the detailed terms and conditions of the Participation Agreements  in accordance with the abovementioned terms and the New Articles. To this end  the Board shall be entitled to make adjustments to meet regulatory and tax requirements or market conditions and other minor adjustments. The Board may also make other adjustments  including deciding to amend the number of Incentive Shares that shall be reclassified for all participants  or for certain categories of participants  covered by the LTIP 2024  if significant changes in the VNV Global group or its operating environment would result in a situation where the decided terms and conditions of LTIP 2024 no longer serve their purpose  however  always observing the provisions of the New Articles and any adjustments shall only be made in order to fulfil the main objectives of LTIP 2024.Information regarding other incentive plans in VNV GlobalPlease refer to VNV Global's Corporate Governance Report 2023  available on VNV Global's website at www.vnv.global under the heading ""Corporate Governance"" for information regarding VNV Global's ongoing share or share-price related incentive plans.Amendment of the Company's articles of association relating to LTIP 2024 (item 17(b))The Board of Directors proposes that the Meeting resolves to amend the Company's articles of association in order to implement LTIP 2024 and enable the issue of the Class C 2024 Shares under LTIP 2024 under items 17(a) and 17(c). The Board's complete proposal regarding articles of association after these amendments as well as the amendments in accordance with item 16 is set out in Appendix A to this notice.Issue of Class C 2024 Shares to the participants (item 17(c))The Board of Directors proposes that the Meeting resolves on a directed new share issue of Class C 2024 Shares (as defined in the New Articles) to the participants in LTIP 2024. The new share issue of Class C 2024 Shares to the participants in LTIP 2024 is conditional upon the Meeting resolving to amend the articles of association in accordance with item 17(b). The following terms shall apply:• The issue of new Class C 2024 Shares will increase the share capital of the Company by no more than SEK 132 080 through the issue of no more than 1 300 000 Class C 2024 Shares.• The subscription price for each Class C 2024 Share is SEK 0.1016.• The participants in LTIP 2024 shall be entitled to subscribe for the Class C 2024 Shares. The allocation shall be determined by the Board of Directors in accordance with LTIP 2024.• The subscription of the Class C 2024 Shares shall be made by payment in cash  and according to the Company's instructions  after registration of the new Articles  but no later than on 31 October 2024. Oversubscription shall not be permitted.• The Class C 2024 Shares are subject to the reclassification and redemption clauses in the New Articles.• The reason for the proposed deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  and the basis for setting the subscription price of the Class C 2024 Shares to SEK 0.1016  is that the new share issue of the Class C 2024 Shares is an integral part of the implementation of LTIP 2024. The Board considers that LTIP 2024 will benefit the Company's shareholders as set out in the proposal for LTIP 2024 in item 17(a) above.• Any share premium shall be transferred to the unrestricted premium reserve.• The new shares entitle the holder to a dividend as from the date on which the shares are entered in the share register maintained by Euroclear Sweden AB.The managing director  or the person appointed by the managing director  is proposed to be authorized to make minor adjustments to the resolution mentioned above  as may be required in connection with the registration of the resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office (Sw. Bolagsverket).Authorisation for the Board of Directors to resolve to issue new shares (item 18)The Board of Directors proposes that the Meeting authorises the Board of Directors to  on one or several occasions  prior to the next Annual General Meeting  with or without deviating from the shareholders' preferential rights  resolve to issue new shares. The Board of Directors shall have the right to resolve that shares shall be paid for with cash  in kind or on conditions set out in Chapter 2 Section 5 Paragraph 1 - 3 and 5 of the Swedish Companies Act (Sw. aktiebolagslagen) or that shares shall be subscribed for by way of set-off. The Board of Directors' resolution to issue new shares may increase the Company's share capital to the extent that it corresponds to an increase of the number of ordinary shares outstanding  at the time of the resolution on the authorisation  of not more than 20 percent. The Board of Directors shall have the right to resolve on further conditions that may be suitable and/or necessary in order to perform the share issues.The reason for authorising the Board to deviate from shareholders' preferential rights is to enable the Company to finance the operations in a fast and efficient way  acquire companies  businesses or parts thereof and to enable a broadening of the ownership of the Company.A resolution in accordance with the Board of Directors' proposal shall only be valid where supported by not less than two-thirds (2/3) of the votes cast as well as of the shares represented at the Meeting.Authorisation for the Board of Directors to resolve to repurchase shares (item 19)The Board of Directors proposes that the Meeting resolves to authorise the Board to decide on the acquisition of the Company's own ordinary shares where  principally  the following shall apply:1. Acquisition of own ordinary shares shall take place on Nasdaq Stockholm.2. The authorisation may be utilised on one or several occasions  however not longer than until the next Annual General Meeting.3. Ordinary shares may be acquired to the extent that the Company's holding of its own shares  on any occasion  does not exceed ten (10) per cent of the Company's total shares.4. Acquisition of shares may only take place at a price within the price interval  on any occasion  recorded on Nasdaq Stockholm  which refers to the interval between the highest buying price and the lowest selling price.The purpose of the proposed authorisation is to provide flexibility in relation to the Company's possibilities to return capital to its shareholders  to improve the capital efficiency in the Company  and to enable the Board of Directors to prevent an excessively wide NAV/share price discount in relation to the Company's shares  which altogether is deemed to be susceptible to have a positive impact on the Company's share price and thereby contribute to an increased shareholder value.A resolution in accordance with the Board of Directors' proposal shall only be valid where supported by not less than two-thirds (2/3) of the votes cast as well as of the shares represented at the Meeting.The Board of Directors' statement in accordance with Chapter 19 Section 22 of the Swedish Companies Act will be held available together with the proposal and on the Company's website no later than three weeks prior to the Meeting.Majority requirementsA resolution in accordance with the Board of Directors' proposal in item 16  18  and 19 above shall only be valid where supported by not less than two-thirds (2/3) of both votes cast  and the shares represented at the Meeting.

It comes down to the dollar's strategic status as a reserve currency and  eventually  to America's ability to finance its national debt.,"Opinion editor's note: Star Tribune Opinion publishes a mix of national and local commentaries online and in print each day. To contribute  click here.•••The Republican House speaker  Mike Johnson  has brought a glimmer of hope to supporters of the Ukrainian war effort. He suggested to Fox News on March 31 that he would try to rally his divided party behind the so-called REPO Act. That piece of legislation would allow President Joe Biden  working with European allies  to seize Russian currency reserves frozen in the West and use them to aid Ukraine.Grabbing these reserves would be politically convenient. Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022  the U.S. and its allies have thrown more than a quarter-trillion dollars into the war  to little ultimate effect. Ukraine has lately suffered a string of battlefield defeats. Prolonging the war is a project that Americans of all political leanings have been steadily less willing to fund through taxes.Johnson backs Ukraine's war effort  and sees supporting it as a responsibility of American leadership. But his caucus — more in tune with the Republican voter base — has stymied him. The REPO Act might offer both Johnson and Biden a way to duck controversy.Thus far  the idea of supplying Ukraine through a spending bill has brought scorn from congressional Republicans who wonder whether Americans' taxes wouldn't be better spent on defending the U.S.-Mexico border. The REPO Act  by contrast  could make ""Russia foot the bill for its own aggression "" as a group of Brookings Institution scholars puts it. Johnson himself calls it ""pure poetry."" It is a tempting idea.But it is a bad one. In any free country there is a constitutional wariness of allowing the government to do anything without levying taxes  for good reason. Taxes and accountability go together. Generally  if citizens aren't paying for a government program through taxes  they are paying for it in some less straightforward way — by taking on debt  for instance  or permitting an outsize governmental role for some corporation or other private interest.The REPO Act carries additional risks. The very act of seizing Russian assets would pose dangers to the U.S. economy  because other countries  not just Russia  would view it as an act of brigandage. This could weaken the dollar's status as the main global reserve currency.The dollar is probably the most valuable strategic asset the U.S. has. We exercise a degree of control over the world economy because the world  for trading purposes  allows its transactions to pass through our currency. This leaves us with cheaper transaction costs and lighter financial burdens. It gives us leeway to run up debt ($34 trillion of it so far) that other countries lack.If Russia  China and other diplomatic rivals were to decide that their dollar assets were vulnerable and that they could no longer trust the dollar as a means of exchange  we would feel the pain of that $34 trillion in debt in a way that we don't now. Retaining the advantages of a reserve currency depends on our behaving as a trustworthy and neutral custodian of others' assets. If we start stealing people's money  that could change.At the start of the war  Russia had about $600 billion in reserves. That means securities denominated in euros  dollars  British pounds  yen and various other stable  convertible currencies  along with gold. In normal times  Russia  like other countries  holds those currencies to facilitate trade and stabilize its own currency. Little of that money — a few billion dollars — is in the United States. Most talk of seizing Russian assets concerns the roughly $300 billion held in Europe  the bulk of it at a depository in Belgium called Euroclear.Although Europeans regulate this money  they have mostly followed America's lead on diplomatic and strategic matters since the start of the war. Individual European countries  above all Germany  have urged caution before laying hands on Russia's reserves  fearing that such a move would jeopardize the euro's own status as a (lesser) reserve currency. The REPO Act could goad them to act more aggressively.The European Union has proposed a compromise between leaving the money alone and seizing it all. It has asked Euroclear to hold in separate accounts the profits generated by its Russian assets. These profits could then be taxed at a high rate  and the proceeds delivered to Ukraine  an accounting maneuver expected to yield about $3 billion a year.Other Europeans have proposed a more reckless course. They argue that Russia's hundreds of billions of dollars should be used as collateral for a large Western war loan to Ukraine  to be repaid out of anticipated reparations  for which the European Union could replace Ukraine as the claimant.These debates come down to the difference between freezing assets and seizing them. For the last few months Biden and his administration have called for seizing the Russian reserves outright and using them to fund the war against Russia — a move that would be  if not entirely unprecedented  then at least radical. Freezing reserves happens. Actually seizing them has been done only in drastic circumstances  and then only in a limited way.The U.S. froze Iranian assets in the opening days of the hostage crisis of 1979 — but most of these were unfrozen two years later. Frozen assets were used to pay war reparations to Kuwaiti victims of Iraq's 1990 invasion — but that was according to a plan approved by the U.N. Security Council the following year. The U.S. seized about $1.7 billion from Iraq in 2003 — but that was in the midst of war. And last September  Biden himself returned a few billion dollars of frozen assets to Iran as part of a deal that saw the repatriation of Americans imprisoned there. Freezing has generally not meant seizing.Things started changing  though  with the disorderly withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan in the summer of 2021. In the aftermath  the Biden administration froze the country's $7 billion in reserves  earmarking half of it for a compensation fund for the families of victims of the Sept. 11 attacks. Even though it was arguably a wartime measure  this kind of seizure was irregular and surprising. Few viewed it as a precedent: Russia's central bank was not hiding its reserves through shell companies or other trickery on the eve of its Ukraine invasion. No one seems to have considered the possibility that a foreign banking authority might simply take the money.Biden and Johnson  in their different ways  are each claiming the mantle of moral leadership for their respective parties. ""American leadership is what holds the world together "" Biden said last fall  and walking away from Ukraine  he contends  would put that leadership at risk. Johnson has accused Biden of ""projecting weakness"" in his foreign policy  and is presenting an alternative.The larger worry is not moral but practical. If the REPO Act is enacted  then currency seizures  now seen as a tool of last resort  might turn into standard operating procedure  to America's detriment. Any foreign government liable to having an American voting bloc riled up against it — China  for starters — would think twice before parking its assets in the U.S. or with one of its NATO allies.That is not yet a probability  but it is a possibility that no politician of either party should lose sight of. For decades now  the U.S  has been deferring hard decisions at home and abroad and papering over partisan divisions with the tens of trillions of dollars that our advantageous international position has allowed us to borrow.

To the extent a board member performs work for the NIBE Group or any of the NIBE Group’s associated companies in addition to the board assignment  these guidelines shall also apply to any remuneration (e.g. consultancy fees) for such work. Unless otherwise stated below  the guidelines do not cover board fees  which are decided by the general meeting.The guidelines’ promotion of the company’s business strategy  long-term interests and sustainabilityIn short  NIBE’s business strategy is to deliver world-class sustainable energy solutions. For more information regarding the company’s business strategy  see www.nibe.com. The successful implementation of the com­pany’s business strategy and the safeguarding of NIBE’s long-term interests  including its sustainability  re­quires that NIBE can attract and retain a highly qualified management team with the capacity to achieve set goals. This requires that the company can offer competitive remuneration conditions. These guidelines enable senior executives to be offered remuneration on market terms and to be competitive in order to attract and retain personnel.The forms of remunerationRemuneration can be paid as fixed salary  variable salary  pension and other benefits such as car benefit.Board fees shall not be paid to senior executives  who are employed by the group.All senior executives  who have not reached the age of 65  shall have retirement benefits corresponding to the defined benefit ITP-plan (supplementary pensions for salaried employees) (SW: ITP-planen)  section 2  up to 30 income base amounts (SW: inkomstbasbelopp). For salary parts in excess of this  a premium at a fixed percentage of 30% shall be paid. The total pension premiums may amount to a maximum of 35% of the total remuneration. Senior executives  who have reached the age of 65  are not entitled to retirement benefits.Other benefits may include medical insurance  life insurance and car benefits  among others  and may not exceed 5% of the total remuneration.Criteria for payment of variable remunerationAs an incentive  senior executives should be able to have a variable salary part  which is paid if set goals are met. These goals are set by the board of directors and shall be measurable and predetermined  e.g. percentage growth  operating margin and working capital reduction. The goals are set for one financial year at a time. By rewarding clear and measurable achievements linked to the company’s financial and operational development  the goals set should contribute to motivate the senior executives to achieve the company’s goals regarding business strategies  long-term perspective and sustainability.The variable salary part shall be limited to four months’ salary. In addition thereto  an extra month’s salary may be paid as remuneration  provided that the senior executive uses this extra remuneration and an addi­tional month’s salary of his/her variable remuneration for acquisition of NIBE-shares. A condition for the extra remuneration is that the senior executive keeps the annually acquired NIBE-shares for at least three years. If this condition is not met  the company is entitled to recover this part of the remuneration. The extra remuner­ation that can be paid for acquiring NIBE-shares aims to increase the senior executives’ long-term commitment to the company and thereby favour the company’s business strategy  long-term interests and sustainability. Normally  the senior executives’ acquisition of NIBE-shares will take place once a year in February/March  by applying the applicable rules against market abuse. The managing director shall not be subject to any incentive programme.Termination of employmentSenior executives shall be employed on a permanent or fixed term basis.The period of notice given by the company to the managing director shall be six months. The managing director shall be entitled to severance payment corresponding to 12 months’ salary.Other senior executives shall receive a salary during a period of notice varying between 6-12 months.There shall be no special agreement stating that a senior executive can leave his/her employment before a certain retirement age and receive a certain part of his/her salary until then.Consideration of salary and terms of employment when preparing the guidelinesWhen preparing the board of directors’ proposal for these guidelines  the average salary and terms of employ­ment for the employees at the Swedish companies in the NIBE group have been taken into account by obtain­ing information regarding the average salary and terms of employment as well as the rate of increase of re­muneration over the period of employment at NIBE. A very important additional factor has been the group’s growth  both in terms of turnover and result. Moreover  a comparison has been made with other Swedish listed companies of the same size. The aforementioned information has been part of the board of directors’ decision-making basis for evaluating the reasonableness of the guidelines.Fees for consultancy services performed by board membersThe company’s board members elected by the general meeting may  in special cases  be remunerated for con­sultancy services within their respective field of competence  which does not constitute board work  for a limited period of time. For these services  a market-based fee shall be paid.How these guidelines have been preparedThese guidelines have been prepared by the board of directors. The managing director and other senior execu­tives have not participated in the board of directors’ preparations and decisions regarding the guidelines.The guidelines are subject to annual review through personal contact by the chairman of the board with the major shareholders.Deviation from the guidelinesThe board of directors may deviate from the guidelines as regards pension  bonus and other benefits if there are special reasons for doing so in an individual case and a deviation is necessary in order to meet the com­pany’s long-term interests and sustainability or to ensure the company’s financial viability.The presence of significant changesThe proposal for guidelines is consistent with the guidelines approved by the Annual General Meeting in 2023. The annual review of the guidelines has not resulted in any significant changes.Available documentsThe annual report and the auditor’s report  complete proposals for decisions concerning items 16 and 17  the auditor’s statement according to Chapter 8 Section 54 of the Swedish Companies Act and other documents will be made available to shareholders at the company’s premises in Markaryd and on the company’s web site  www.nibe.com  no later than 25 April 2024 and will be sent to shareholders requesting it and stating their address.InformationThe shareholders are informed of their right to request information at the Annual General Meeting concerning circumstances that may affect the assessment of an item on the agenda and circumstances that may affect the assessment of the company’s financial situation.Shares and votesAt the time of issuance of this notice  the total number of shares in the company amounts to 2 016 066 488  of which 233 130 360 shares are of class A and 1 782 936 128 shares are of class B.

Orange's operations and customer service teams will benefit from those AI models by getting the answers they need faster  while customers will experience a faster time-to-resolution and improved quality of service. Improved Customer Experience: Beyond the contact center  Orange has leveraged AI and Google Cloud technology to deliver personalized recommendations for relevant phones  plans  and services“improving customer lifetime value. GDC also allows gen AI-based speech recognition to occur in each Orange country  bringing these powerful AI technologies even to countries without a Google Cloud region.""We have a mission to accelerate value creation for Orange with every job  every network  and every customer experience super-powered by responsible AI. Orange sees enormous value in AI across every dimension of our business "" said Christel Heydemann   CEO of Orange Group. ""This partnership with Google Cloud and the cutting-edge solutions announced today are foundational to Orange achieving AI at scale and is a major step towards unlocking significant value from all of our data.""To achieve its goals of bringing AI capabilities into each of the regions it serves  Orange required a secure solution to enhance cloud services at a local level  while still meeting local regulatory requirements around security and data residency.

Communications and internet connectivity in Antarctica is currently limited to solutions offering at most 1-5 Mbps in both uplink and downlink  despite the significant number of crucial scientific research outposts in the region. Eutelsat OneWeb's services will deliver significantly increased reliability and data-rates up to 120 Mbps.In order to deliver services to the Antarctic region  Eutelsat OneWeb developed a proprietary system named TALARIA after the Latin word used to describe the 'winged sandals' of Mercury  God of communication. The innovative system includes a ground station in Chile along with a user terminal installed in Rothera Research Station 1 000 miles away. The technology will match the high data use needs of the scientific activities at the research outposts in Antarctica  along with the connectivity needs of the staff based at the stations.The design of the TALARIA system was made possible thanks to the support of the European Space Agency (ESA) Sunrise Partnership Project as well as Comtech Telecommunications Corp. and Cobham Satcom  our partners for the development and implementation of the ground infrastructure solution.Consistent high-speed  low latency connectivity has the potential to totally transform the activity at the stations and in the wider Antarctic region  for example by allowing scientists to better conduct their day-to-day activities by facilitating real-time support from scientific  technical or health teams around the world. It will also provide vital connectivity to help improve the welfare of the scientists  outside of working hours  as they are often deployed for 18 months at a time in one of the remotest and geographically challenging areas of the world.Julius Rix  Head of Engineering at British Antarctic Survey  said  ""We're excited to see how using Eutelsat OneWeb will change the connectivity for living and working at Rothera Research Station. Knowing we have such an increase in bandwidth is a gamechanger for our communications connectivity  allowing transfer of big data files and giving us the opportunity to do live broadcast interviews from one of the remotest places on Earth. This has the potential to change the way we work and the type of science we can carry out.Maurizio Vanotti  VP for Commercial Strategy and Innovation Eutelsat OneWeb  said ""With communications and internet connectivity limited in Antarctica  this trial in the region is a testament to our commitment to facilitating global connectivity in the most unconnected regions of the world. We look forward to continuing our work with the British Antarctic Survey and expanding our coverage of Antarctica  to demonstrate LEO's power to extend beyond the geographical constraints of traditional connectivity and unlock new opportunities.""""The TALARIA system is an innovation to deliver dramatically increased bandwidth using LEO connectivity for the very hardest to reach parts of the world. Valery Gineste  VP of Technology & Innovation at Eutelsat OneWeb said  "" This has been an exciting opportunity to create an entirely new remote connectivity system for Antarctica from concept to delivery inside 18 months.""Stephane Lascar Head of Satellite Programmes Department in Connectivity and Secure Communications Directorate at ESA said: ""We are delighted to be part of this unique demonstration of connectivity in a remote area such as Antarctica. At ESA  in collaboration with Eutelsat OneWeb through the Sunrise Partnership Project  we aim to offer connectivity and beyond not only to businesses but also to scientific communities and other users  to benefit from the best of the technologies. As ever  innovation is vital  and we support European space companies to succeed in the highly competitive global market for telecommunications satellites.""""We are thrilled to work with Eutelsat OneWeb to deliver connectivity in some of the world's most challenging geographic regions like the Antarctic "" said John Ratigan  Interim CEO  Comtech. ""To enable this first-ever demonstration  Comtech delivered its market leading ELEVATE baseband and RF solution to support resilient  high-speed connectivity over OneWeb's LEO satellite constellation. Comtech's ELEVATE solution is a transportable  software defined VSAT system  which is proven to provide commercial and government customers with access high-speed connectivity across diverse satellite constellations in multiple orbits.""""We are proud to support the TALARIA project  and to play a part in helping Eutelsat OneWeb to adapt and demonstrate the value of its network""  noted Chris Schram  Cobham Senior Director of Business Development.""Our compact  radome-protected 2.4m TRACKER Gateways performed flawlessly in challenging conditions  and exemplary collaboration by the Eutelsat OneWeb team with their TALARIA technology partners enabled this fast-track project to bring reliable  high-speed connectivity to Antarctica.""",neutral,0.02,0.97,0.01,positive,0.66,0.33,0.02,True,English,"['British Antarctic Survey', 'Eutelsat Communications', 'trial services', 'OneWeb', 'April', '05', 'transportable, software defined VSAT system', 'Consistent high-speed, low latency connectivity', 'high data use needs', 'market leading ELEVATE baseband', 'low Earth orbit services', 'ESA) Sunrise Partnership Project', 'crucial scientific research outposts', 'new remote connectivity system', 'big data files', 'European Space Agency', 'geographically challenging areas', 'Satellite Programmes Department', 'European space companies', 'competitive global market', 'diverse satellite constellations', 'British Antarctic Survey', 'live broadcast interviews', 'challenging geographic regions', 'resilient, high-speed connectivity', 'Rothera Research Station', 'London Stock Exchange', 'Stephane Lascar Head', 'LEO satellite constellation', 'ground infrastructure solution', 'Secure Communications Directorate', 'wider Antarctic region', 'Comtech Telecommunications Corp.', 'ELEVATE solution', 'ground station', 'new opportunities', 'remote area', 'connectivity needs', 'proprietary system', 'innovative system', 'TALARIA system', 'live broadcasting', 'scientific activities', 'unconnected regions', 'scientific communities', 'telecommunications satellites', 'global connectivity', 'RF solution', 'far south', 'Eutelsat Group', 'Euronext Paris', 'world-leading centre', 'polar operations', 'significant number', 'Latin word', 'winged sandals', 'user terminal', 'Cobham Satcom', 'health teams', 'working hours', 'Julius Rix', 'Maurizio Vanotti', 'geographical constraints', 'Valery Gineste', 'other users', 'John Ratigan', 'Interim CEO', 'government customers', 'multiple orbits', 'internet connectivity', 'vital connectivity', 'traditional connectivity', 'LEO connectivity', 'Eutelsat OneWeb', 'communications connectivity', 'polar science', '1-5 Mbps', 'day activities', 'real-time support', 'remotest places', 'Commercial Strategy', 'exciting opportunity', 'unique demonstration', '120 Mbps', 'way', 'Antarctica', 'potential', 'UK', '9 April', 'ISIN', 'ETL', 'January', 'solutions', 'uplink', 'downlink', 'reliability', 'data-rates', 'order', 'Mercury', 'God', 'Chile', 'technology', 'staff', 'stations', 'design', 'development', 'implementation', 'activity', 'example', 'scientists', 'technical', 'welfare', '18 months', 'Engineering', 'increase', 'bandwidth', 'gamechanger', 'transfer', 'type', 'VP', 'Innovation', 'trial', 'testament', 'commitment', 'coverage', 'power', 'parts', 'concept', 'collaboration', 'businesses', 'technologies', 'first-ever', 'access']",2024-04-09,2024-04-10,marketscreener.com

The lead cancer vaccine candidate UV1 is an off-the-shelf vaccine directed against human telomerase (hTERT)  an antigen present in 85-90% of cancers in all stages of tumor growth. A broad clinical program  with Phase II trials in five cancer indications enrolling more than 670 patients  aims to investigate UV1’s impact in combination with other immunotherapies in multiple cancer types. UV1 is a patented technology owned by Ultimovacs. In addition  Ultimovacs’ adjuvant platform  based on the proprietary Tetanus-Epitope-Targeting (TET) technology  combines tumor-specific antigens and adjuvant in the same molecule and is in Phase I clinical development.The Company is listed on Euronext Oslo Stock Exchange (ULTI).About the UV1 Phase II programThe immunotherapeutic cancer vaccine UV1 is investigated in combination with checkpoint inhibitors in patients with various cancer indications with diverse tumor biology. The clinical strategy behind the UV1 Phase II program’s diversity is to evaluate the potential broad applicability of the cancer vaccine when combined with other immunotherapies:INITIUM: Evaluating UV1 in combination with ipilimumab and nivolumab as first-line treatment for patients with malignant melanoma. Enrollment of 156 patients completed in July 2022. Sponsored by Ultimovacs. With the 18 months minimum follow-up of the patients in the INITIUM trial  the trial did not meet the primary or secondary endpoints. Median PFS was not reached in either arm. UV1 maintained its positive safety profile with similar safety and tolerability as observed in the control arm.NIPU: Evaluating UV1 in combination with ipilimumab and nivolumab as second-line treatment for patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma. Enrollment of 118 patients completed in January 2023. Data presented at the ESMO Congress in October 2023  showed that UV1 as add-on to ipilimumab and nivolumab  demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement of overall survival versus ipilimumab and nivolumab alone. 31% of the patients receiving UV1 vaccine experienced an objective response  compared to 16% in the control arm.

The investigator-initiated study is led by Vestre Viken (Drammen Hospital) and supported by Ultimovacs.About UV1UV1 is a universal cancer vaccine designed to induce a specific T-cell response against telomerase. UV1 consists of long  synthetic peptides representing a sequence in the reverse transcriptase subunit of telomerase (hTERT)  shown to induce CD4+ T-cells. These CD4+ T-cells have the potential to provide inflammatory signals  and T-cell support is believed to be critical for triggering a strong anti-tumor immune response. Following intradermal injection  antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in the skin are exposed to the vaccine peptides. These APCs will process the peptides and present vaccine epitopes on Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) molecules to naïve T-cells in the lymph nodes. Activated vaccine-specific T-cells will then enter the circulation and search for cells displaying their cognate antigen in the context of HLA molecules.The UV1 peptides contain several epitopes  shown to be non-restrictive in terms of (HLA) alleles for presentation. It is  therefore not required to perform HLA pre-screening of patients  which potentially enables broad population utilization of the vaccine. UV1 is administered over three months as eight intradermal injections together with the immune-modulator GM-CSF.For further information  please contact:Carlos de Sousa  CEOEmail: carlos.desousa@ultimovacs.comPhone: +47 908 92507Anne Worsøe  Head of Investor RelationsEmail: anne.worsoe@ultimovacs.comPhone: +47 90686815This stock exchange announcement was published by Anne Worsøe  Head of Investor Relations at Ultimovacs ASA  on April 9  2024 at 20:00CET.",neutral,0.03,0.96,0.01,mixed,0.41,0.21,0.38,True,English,"['Business Update', 'Ultimovacs', 'Invitation', 'April', 'small cell lung cancer patients', 'proprietary Tetanus-Epitope-Targeting (TET) technology', 'strong anti-tumor immune response', 'Euronext Oslo Stock Exchange', 'Phase I clinical development', 'lead cancer vaccine candidate', 'UV1 Phase II program', 'immunotherapeutic cancer vaccine UV1', 'Phase II trials', 'immunotherapeutic cancer vaccines', 'five cancer indications', 'multiple cancer types', 'various cancer indications', 'advanced ovarian cancer', 'NON-REGULATORY PRESS RELEASE', 'Q&A session', 'broad clinical program', '18 months minimum follow-up', 'reverse transcriptase subunit', 'universal cancer vaccine', 'diverse tumor biology', 'positive safety profile', 'malignant pleural mesothelioma', 'specific T-cell response', 'clinical-stage biotechnology company', 'potential broad applicability', 'long, synthetic peptides', 'Oslo University Hospital', 'BRCA mutated patients', 'Human Leukocyte Antigen', 'Ultimovacs’ adjuvant platform', 'neck cancer', 'patented technology', 'objective response', 'clinical strategy', 'shelf vaccine', 'vaccine peptides', 'vaccine epitopes', 'tumor growth', 'malignant melanoma', 'similar safety', 'Halle University', 'Drammen Hospital', 'T-cell support', 'company update', 'The Company', 'UV1 vaccine', 'recent developments', 'future potential', 'other immunotherapies', 'tumor-specific antigens', 'same molecule', 'checkpoint inhibitors', 'first-line treatment', 'secondary endpoints', 'Median PFS', 'second-line treatment', 'ESMO Congress', 'meaningful improvement', 'overall survival', 'investigator-initiated study', 'Bristol-Myers Squibb', 'maintenance therapy', 'Q4 2023 reporting', 'Vestre Viken', 'CD4+ T-cells', 'inflammatory signals', 'intradermal injection', 'antigen-presenting cells', 'HLA) molecules', 'human telomerase', 'OSE ULTI', 'control arm', 'Ultimovacs ASA', 'INITIUM trial', 'Ultimovacs’ management', '670 patients', '156 patients', '118 patients', '75 patients', '184 patients', '138 patients', 'April', 'webcast', 'presentation', 'Wednesday', 'Time', 'Link', 'royalcast', 'landingpage', 'hegnarmedia', 'replay', 'Questions', 'ENDS', 'hTERT', 'cancers', 'stages', 'impact', 'combination', 'addition', 'diversity', 'ipilimumab', 'nivolumab', 'Enrollment', 'July', 'primary', 'tolerability', 'NIPU', 'January', 'Data', 'October', 'significant', 'FOCUS', 'pembrolizumab', 'head', 'August', 'Germany', 'DOVACC', 'olaparib', 'durvalumab', 'NSGO-CTU', 'ENGOT', 'AstraZeneca', 'H1', 'LUNGVAC', 'cemiplimab', 'sequence', 'APCs', 'skin']",2024-04-09,2024-04-10,marketscreener.com

These data are highlighted in the AACR press conference being held today and in a poster presentation which will take place tomorrow  April 10  at 9:00 a.m. PDT.TG4050 is based on Transgene’s myvac® platform and powered by NEC’s cutting-edge AI capabilities designed to optimize antigen selection.Key findings of the poster include:All 16 patients who received TG4050 are disease free after a median 18.6-month follow-up. Out of the 16 patients in the control observation arm  3 patients have relapsed. For this head and neck cancer patient population and with current standard of care  approximately 40% of patients are expected to relapse within 24 months following surgery and adjuvant therapy (chemoradiotherapy). Also  the tumor immune contexture  expression of immune factors  mutational burden  and tumor infiltrates are associated with challenging prognoses.and with current standard of care  approximately 40% of patients are expected to relapse within 24 months following surgery and adjuvant therapy (chemoradiotherapy). Also  the tumor immune contexture  expression of immune factors  mutational burden  and tumor infiltrates are associated with challenging prognoses. Specific cellular immune responses were detected in the 16/17 patients who received TG4050 (16 patients in the treatment arm and one patient from the observation arm treated after relapse) using stringent testing criteria . Immunogenicity or the capacity of treatment to induce immune responses are key to prevent relapses.(16 patients in the treatment arm and one patient from the observation arm treated after relapse) using stringent testing criteria Immunogenicity or the capacity of treatment to induce immune responses are key to prevent relapses. TG4050 induced persistent immune responses against multiple targets in several patients. T cell responses were maintained beyond 211 days (7 months) after the initiation of the treatment. The duration of the immune response is also a key factor to fight disease over time.Alessandro Riva  Chairman and CEO of Transgene  commented: “We are honored by AACR’s interest in the Phase I data generated from our individualized cancer vaccine TG4050. It is exciting to note that all patients who received TG4050 are in remission still and remain disease-free after a median follow-up of 18.6 months  which compares favorably to the observational arm which saw 3 out of 16 patients relapse during the same period.”“More importantly  almost all treated patients developed a specific immune response against the antigen targets we selected  providing robust proof of principle for our lead candidate. TG4050 is now starting to show a potential benefit for head and neck cancer patients at high risk of relapse. We look forward to starting the Phase II part of the trial in the adjuvant setting for head and neck cancer.”Dr. Oliver Lantz  Head of the clinical immunology laboratory at Institut Curie  added: “The immunological data generated by TG4050 demonstrate a robust and specific cellular immune response  even under stringent measurement criteria. The diversity  depth and duration of these responses were most certainly a key factor in preventing relapse in the patients treated with TG4050.”Masamitsu Kitase  Corporate SVP and Head of the Healthcare and Life Sciences Division at NEC  concluded: “Our state-of-the-art proprietary artificial intelligence and machine learning models have allowed us to identify immunogenic and clinically relevant mutations in all head and neck cancer patients for this TG4050 randomized Phase I trial. These tumors were characterized by a low tumor mutation burden  which presents an obstacle to designing a relevant vaccine. Our powerful platform enables us to identify mutations for individualized treatments which have now shown the first signs of clinical benefit for patients. Together with Transgene  we look forward to continuing to build on these promising data through our planned Phase II trial in the adjuvant treatment of head and neck cancer.”TG4050 is being evaluated in a randomized multicenter Phase I/II trial as a single agent in the adjuvant treatment of HPV-negative head and neck cancers ( NCT04183166 ) .

Through the use of Google Distributed Cloud  Orange can meet local requirements for cloud environments  accelerate AI adoption and benefits for customers  and foster an open and value-driven approach.Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) is a fully managed hardware and software solution that brings the power of Google's AI services to the Edge  air-gapped environments  and Cross-Cloud. Designed with AI and data-intensive workloads in mind  GDC will enable Orange to take a pivotal step towards accelerating AI adoption into its operations across the 26 countries it serves. The company is focusing on three areas with AI:Smarter Networks: With GDC  Orange will get an environment to run sensitive network data and AI workloads that some country regulators may require to be local or on-premise. From capacity planning to root cause analysis  Orange can benefit from significant improvements in network planning and design through the automation of reporting  classification  and analysis.With GDC  Orange will get an environment to run sensitive network data and AI workloads that some country regulators may require to be local or on-premise. From capacity planning to root cause analysis  Orange can benefit from significant improvements in network planning and design through the automation of reporting  classification  and analysis. Operational Efficiency: Orange will be able to run gen AI models on-premise in an environment that is very elegantly integrated into similar Vertex AI services on Google Cloud. Orange's operations and customer service teams will benefit from those AI models by getting the answers they need faster  while customers will experience a faster time-to-resolution and improved quality of service.Orange will be able to run gen AI models on-premise in an environment that is very elegantly integrated into similar Vertex AI services on Google Cloud. Orange's operations and customer service teams will benefit from those AI models by getting the answers they need faster  while customers will experience a faster time-to-resolution and improved quality of service. Improved Customer Experience: Beyond the contact center  Orange has leveraged AI and Google Cloud technology to deliver personalized recommendations for relevant phones  plans  and services–improving customer lifetime value. GDC also allows gen AI-based speech recognition to occur in each Orange country  bringing these powerful AI technologies even to countries without a Google Cloud region.""We have a mission to accelerate value creation for Orange with every job  every network  and every customer experience super-powered by responsible AI. Orange sees enormous value in AI across every dimension of our business "" said Christel Heydemann  CEO of Orange Group. ""This partnership with Google Cloud and the cutting-edge solutions announced today are foundational to Orange achieving AI at scale and is a major step towards unlocking significant value from all of our data.""To achieve its goals of bringing AI capabilities into each of the regions it serves  Orange required a secure solution to enhance cloud services at a local level  while still meeting local regulatory requirements around security and data residency. Google Cloud worked with Orange from the concept stage onwards to co-design its Google Distributed Cloud (GDC) deployment  which allows Orange to establish a local cloud that delivers heightened resilience  particularly in challenging environments  while optimizing performance and reducing latency for critical workloads.This collaboration will bring the cloud to Orange's own data centers  protecting sensitive workloads that must stay on-premises and also enabling Orange to filter extremely high-volume data  such as over one petabyte a day of network telemetry. By bringing the cloud into the data center via GDC  Orange is enabling faster deployment of AI applications for local teams  and fostering agility and responsiveness. Moreover  this collaboration opens up avenues for new business opportunities  as it makes it possible for use cases to be delivered across many Orange countries.""Businesses are increasingly bringing gen AI solutions to the edge of the network to ensure better agility  responsiveness  and resilience "" said Thomas Kurian  CEO of Google Cloud. ""Our partnership with Orange addresses that need  combining data  reliable infrastructure  and leading AI technologies to create new solutions to meet Orange's global needs""Orange and Google Cloud have collaborated since 2020 to fuel Orange's digital transformation through data and AI. Over the last three years  Orange has migrated 13 petabytes of data to Google Cloud and has many strategic use cases in production across ten countries running on Google Cloud. The two companies' shared passion for innovation has resulted in a collaboration that has brought secure  customizable  best-in-class solutions to customers across geographies and industries.About Google CloudGoogle Cloud is the new way to the cloud  providing AI  infrastructure  developer  data  security  and collaboration tools built for today and tomorrow.

The campaign captures the iconic and refreshing ˜first sip' feeling you get from a crisp  uniquely balanced Heineken ® when finishing your day and starting your evening “ no matter where you are in the world.Nabil Nasser  Global Head  Heineken ® Brand  says: As a brand rooted in more than 150 years of brewing heritage  our perfectly balanced  refreshing taste has become known across the world as a great beer to have with friends. ˜The First Ahhh!' embodies that feeling at the end of the day when you can grab a beer with a group of friends.

We're excited to bottle up that unique ˜First Ahhh!' feeling and share it with the world.Heineken ® has delivered its consistent taste and perfectly balanced taste to the world with its unique recipe for more than 150 years. Ever wondered what makes the perfect serve? Heineken ® Master Brewer Willem van Waesberghe recommends looking out for the following six signs:The glass should be held at the base “ this keeps the beer as cool and crisp as possible. The tap should be opened in one firm motion “ your server needs to be confident “ if opened slowly  they risk squeezing the line  resulting in excess foam falling into the glass before the tap is fully opened. The glass should be tilted precisely at a 45-degree angle with the beer pouring down the inside of the glass “ this creates that mesmerising whirlpool effect that whips up the foam underneath. Remember “ the nozzle should never touch the beer  as this breaks the surface tension which impacts the crisp  refreshing taste. The head of foam should be solid and perfectly balanced on the arms of the iconic Red Star  all the way to the rim of the glass “ in scientific terms  the perfect pint should consist of 95% beer  5% foam  as this best brings out the beer's aroma  whilst preventing oxidation and your beer going flat. Your server should start skimming the moment the beer overflows  using a wet skimmer at a 45-degree angle “ this removes excess foam and creates an unbroken seal. Skimming removes large bubbles on top of the foam that protects it from oxygen and maintains the head for longer. Wherever you enjoy a Heineken ®  the ˜first sip' feeling is best enjoyed in a glass “ no matter where you are in the world  pour your Heineken ® from the bottle and into a lager glass to unlock the full flavour experience.Willem van Waesberghe  Master Brewer at Heineken ® says: It's easy to take for granted the refreshment and uniquely balanced taste a Heineken ® always provides “ whether Original  Silver or 0.0 “ as it is so consistent wherever in the world you enjoy it. However  there is a true science behind the sip  driven by our Five-Star Brewing Principles  including Heineken ®'s famous A-yeast  quality Pure Malt  100% natural ingredients  a horizontal brewing method and our verified Star Brewers  a title that takes 10 years to attain - that provide you with the ˜First Ahhh!' feeling.Heineken ® has worked with renowned UK chef Lee Tiernan of London's ˜F.K.A.

The end goal of a beer and food pairing is that when combined  you end up with a more balanced flavour than each would be alone. That's why Heineken ® is the perfect accompaniment for most dishes “ its moderate body  light  fruity taste with a lingering fruit and balanced bitterness finish complements a huge range of flavours.

Current operating income rose by 20.4% to €38.4 million  resulting in a current operating margin of 3.7%  compared with 3.3% in 2022.All the group's businesses contributed to this strong performance. Their contribution to revenue and operating income is as follows:Results by business Revenue Current operating income € million € million % of revenue Home Building 875.6 29.9 3.4% Renovation 54.3 3.9 7.2% Real Estate Development 69.1 1.6 2.3% Land Development 25.4 3.1 12.2% Total 1.024.4 38.4 3.7%The Home Building business posted record revenue of €875.6 million  up by 8.1%. Current operating income rose by 36.5% to €29.9 million. As a result  the current operating margin is up 0.7 points to 3.4% of revenue  compared with 2.7% in 2022. This improvement is attributed to a recovery in the net margin on variable costs during the latter half of the year  along with the initial impacts of actions taken to adjust the fixed cost structure to market conditions.Renovation revenue rose by 2.6% to €54.3 million. Current operating income increased by 62% to €3.9 million  resulting in a normative margin of 7.2% of revenue  up from 4.5% the previous year. This strong performance highlights the effectiveness of a business model that partly relies on franchising. It also reflects the impact of measure taken to align selling prices with increased production costs.Real Estate Development revenue is up 2.2% to €69.1 million. Current operating income amounted to €1.6 million  resulting in a margin of 2.3% compared to 3.8% in 2022. Considering the challenging market conditions  this downturn is primarily due to unmet sales targets  which directly affected 2023 revenue for this business.The Land Development business follows trends in the property market and posted revenue of €25.4 million  compared with €33.7 million in 2022. Current operating income amounted to €3.1 million  representing a margin of 12.2% compared to 15.1% the previous year.After taking into account a €3.7 million charge for non-current operating items corresponding to goodwill impairment for the “Home Building” network's optimisation  operating income for the year rose by 7.1% to €34.7 million.Net income from continuing operations includes financial income of -€1.1 million and a positive impact from deferred tax. At €33.4 million  this represents an increase of 40.9% compared to last year and 3.3% of revenue (2.5% in 2022).The group's financial structure has been strengthened even further. The group share of equity at 31 December 2023 amounted to €212.5 millionand its cash position stood at €159.2 million. Net cash was €81.0 million  compared with €42.2 million at the end of 2022.Dividend for 2023The board of directors will submit a no dividend resolution for 2023 earnings at the annual general meeting on June 5th.This decision does not affect Hexaom's earnings distribution policy in the long run.However  the group wishes to safeguard its fundamentals  its cash and also ensure that the burden of efforts is shared fairly among all stakeholders during this unprecedented crisis.Order intake : a reflection of an unprecedented market contextAs anticipated  the order intake at the end of February 2024 indicates that the market remains challenging for the entire industry  with new housing orders declining by more than 40% in 2023. This unprecedented situation has emerged from a mix of several adverse factors over the past two years:- tighter financing conditions - a sharp rise in interest rates - an inflationary environment that penalises household purchasing power - regulatory and administrative hurdles (standards  deadlines for issuing building permits  zoning  a surge in the number of appeals  etc.).In response to these challenges and to safeguard its profitability  Hexaom implemented measures starting in 2022 to adjust to decreasing volumes and to maintain its margins in each of its businesses.Home BuildingThe order intake in 2023 represents revenue of €559.4 million  down 40.6% compared with 2022.Sales in the first two months of 2024 remained in line with this trend and represent revenue of €51.9 million  down 44.3% in value. Sales performance in the first quarter of 2024 continued to be adversely affected by an unfavourable base effect  with the deterioration in 2023 sales worsening from the second quarter onwards.After more than 2 years of steadily increasing selling prices to absorb sharp rises in construction costs  the average selling price has stabilised at €166.2k excluding VAT.To cope with the decline in production volumes in 2024 and guarantee the operational profitability of this business:- the group relies on its business model based on a high degree of variability in production costs due to the use of subcontractors (100%) - in addition  the group quickly rolled out measures to calibrate its fixed cost structure to the market environment. These measures mainly involved reducing the workforce  optimising the regional network and drastically cutting overheads.RenovationPositioned in a more buoyant market but still impacted by inflation  the Renovation business continues to expand  thanks in particular to the growing Camif Habitat and Illico Travaux national franchise networks and the gradual expansion of the “renovation/extension” offering in the group's home building branches.At 31 December 2023  order intake from the intermediated business (franchises) was up 22.8% to €103.9 million  and the general contractor business posted revenue of €39.7 million.In January and February 2024  general contractor orders totalled €3.4 million  while intermediated orders rose by 43.5% to €23.6 million.To date  the Renovation franchise network has 170 Illico Travaux franchisees and 55 Camif Habitat franchisees.Real Estate DevelopmentAt the end of February 2024  the Real Estate Development business backlog was €128.7 million and the total potential inventory to be delivered (including projects where a preliminary land deal has been signed) represented revenue of €324.2 million  i.e. 1 484 housing units. In the current market context  the group's strategy is to focus on small  mid-range to high-end developments  mainly outside of Paris  with a secure customer mix (predominantly social housing and institutional investors).Land DevelopmentThe order book (reserved inventory not yet signed) for the Land Development business at the end of February reflects the market environment. It totals €8.5 million and represents 128 lots. With the gradual introduction of the new Zan legislation (zero soil sealing)  this business is becoming more strategic than ever for the group and could benefit from opportunities arising from industry consolidation in the coming months.A solid foundation for weathering the current crisisIn 2024  the market remains sluggish but has begun to show early signs of recovery  including stabilising construction costs  a minor decrease in interest rates and a gradual easing of lending conditions. In this context  the group possesses strong advantages:1. A proven  cash-generating business model for its Home Building activity  with 20-month visibility and a high variability of costs.2. Diversified revenue streams (renovation  real estate development  land development) with generally higher margins  whose contribution to group revenue could represent around 30% within 3 years  and eventually reach the goal of 50%.3. An extremely sound financial structure allowing the group to preserve the trust of all its stakeholders (including customers  suppliers  subcontractors  guarantors and bankers) and to seize opportunities within a rapidly concentrating sector.Maintaining operational performance in 2024Against this backdrop  and after taking into account orders at the end of February  Hexaom expects its 2024 production to fall by around 25% to 30% compared with 2023.Measures to adjust the cost structure to market conditions  which have already been widely implemented  will continue. Their impact will fully materialise in the second half of 2024. Consequently  the group is expected to sustain a satisfactory operating profit margin  ranging from 3% to 4% of its annual revenue.Information Meeting: 25 March 2024  10:00 am at the Edouard VII Business Centre – Paris 9thTo register  contact comfi@hexaom.frNext press release: 2024 Q1 Revenue  7 May 2024  after market close.ABOUT THE GROUPSince 1919  five generations of the same family have successively taken over the helm of HEXAOM  a group that drives and federates an ecosystem of 45 brands and subsidiaries with complementary expertise.

Please refer to the disclaimer in this press release.Parameters of Atos’ refinancing frameworkAs indicated in its press release of March 26th  2024  Atos SE has entered into an amicable conciliation procedure in order to frame discussions with its financial creditors. This is to facilitate the emergence of a global agreement regarding the restructuring of its financial debt within a short and limited timeframe of four months  which could be further extended by one month if needed.In this context  Atos SE presented on Monday April 8  2024 to its financial creditors the Company’s key parameters of its refinancing framework  which included:€600 million of cash needed to fund the business over the 2024-25 period. Funds to be provided in the form of debt and/or equity by existing stakeholders or third party investors;€300m revolving credit facility  and €300m of guarantee lines;Targeting a BB credit profile by 2026  which implies a financial leverage 7 below 3x by year-end 2025 and below 2x by year-end 2026 and a gross debt reduction of €2.4 billion;below 3x by year-end 2025 and below 2x by year-end 2026 and a gross debt reduction of €2.4 billion; A 5-year maturity extension for the residual financial debt.These parameters are based on the Group’s current perimeter  which includes the assets of Eviden and Tech Foundations without taking into account the impact of any potential asset disposals.These parameters act as guidelines for all interested parties who will ultimately present their proposals to the company and the conciliator.The Group’s refinancing framework aims to achieve the following objectives:To protect the social interest of the Company  including its employees  clients  suppliers  shareholders  and other stakeholders and preserve the strategic interests of the French StateSecure operational stability: Ensure business continuity of the Group and its long-term sustainability; Reassure clients  employees and suppliers on Atos’ counterparty credit worthiness;Ensure ample liquidity to execute the Group’s business plan: Provide adequate time to implement Atos’ strategic plan and deliver results; Have a fully funded business plan over the 2024-2027 period;Establish a sustainable capital structure: Align capital structure with Company’s future cash flow generation; Implement a debt structure that will support future successful refinancing;Regain a BB credit rating profile by 2026: Consistent with Atos’ quality of assets; Enhance access to capital markets.The main figures of Atos’ financial debt and the coming maturities of Atos SE’s borrowings are detailed in Appendix 1 of this press release and in the presentation.Interim financingAtos has reached an agreement in principle with a group of banks and a group of bondholders regarding an interim financing in the amount of €400 million  consisting of:€300 million factoring facility provided by the banks;€100 million revolving credit facility provided by the bondholders.In addition  provided the Group’s financing banks grant a waiver  the French State has agreed in principle to extend a €50 million loan through the FDES (Fonds de Développement Economique et Social) to a subsidiary of Atos  Bull SA  which controls sovereign sensitive activities. This loan shall be reimbursed in full at the closing of the refinancing.Atos will commit  in return  to sign an agreement at the level of Bull SA for the benefit of the French State which together with the issuance of a preferred share (action de préférence) by Bull SA will give the French State protection rights on such sovereign sensitive activities  under a legal documentation to be finalized. This agreement in principle provides for a right for the French State to purchase sovereign sensitive activities if a third-party has acquired 10% or a multiple of 10% of Atos’ share capital or voting rights and Atos and the French State have not reached a reasonable agreement on how to protect national interests in relation to these sovereign sensitive activities (without prejudice to the application of the French FDI regime).

This means that a public tender will still have to be filed if the threshold of 30% of the share capital or voting rights is exceeded. At the end of this period  McPhy will be subject to the regulation applicable to companies listed on Euronext Growth Paris  and the obligation to file a public offer will apply if the threshold of 50% of the Company's capital or voting rights is upward crossed.Periodic informationMcPhy will publish  within 4 months of the year-end  a report including its annual statutory and consolidated financial statements  a management report (simplified content) and the Statutory auditors' reports.

The mandatory rules on parity within the Board of Directors set out in Articles L. 225-18-1 and L. 22-10-3 of the French Commercial Code will no longer apply.
