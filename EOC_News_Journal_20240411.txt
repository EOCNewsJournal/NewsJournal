To the extent a board member performs work for the NIBE Group or any of the NIBE Group’s associated companies in addition to the board assignment  these guidelines shall also apply to any remuneration (e.g. consultancy fees) for such work. Unless otherwise stated below  the guidelines do not cover board fees  which are decided by the general meeting.The guidelines’ promotion of the company’s business strategy  long-term interests and sustainabilityIn short  NIBE’s business strategy is to deliver world-class sustainable energy solutions. For more information regarding the company’s business strategy  see www.nibe.com. The successful implementation of the com­pany’s business strategy and the safeguarding of NIBE’s long-term interests  including its sustainability  re­quires that NIBE can attract and retain a highly qualified management team with the capacity to achieve set goals. This requires that the company can offer competitive remuneration conditions. These guidelines enable senior executives to be offered remuneration on market terms and to be competitive in order to attract and retain personnel.The forms of remunerationRemuneration can be paid as fixed salary  variable salary  pension and other benefits such as car benefit.Board fees shall not be paid to senior executives  who are employed by the group.All senior executives  who have not reached the age of 65  shall have retirement benefits corresponding to the defined benefit ITP-plan (supplementary pensions for salaried employees) (SW: ITP-planen)  section 2  up to 30 income base amounts (SW: inkomstbasbelopp). For salary parts in excess of this  a premium at a fixed percentage of 30% shall be paid. The total pension premiums may amount to a maximum of 35% of the total remuneration. Senior executives  who have reached the age of 65  are not entitled to retirement benefits.Other benefits may include medical insurance  life insurance and car benefits  among others  and may not exceed 5% of the total remuneration.Criteria for payment of variable remunerationAs an incentive  senior executives should be able to have a variable salary part  which is paid if set goals are met. These goals are set by the board of directors and shall be measurable and predetermined  e.g. percentage growth  operating margin and working capital reduction. The goals are set for one financial year at a time. By rewarding clear and measurable achievements linked to the company’s financial and operational development  the goals set should contribute to motivate the senior executives to achieve the company’s goals regarding business strategies  long-term perspective and sustainability.The variable salary part shall be limited to four months’ salary. In addition thereto  an extra month’s salary may be paid as remuneration  provided that the senior executive uses this extra remuneration and an addi­tional month’s salary of his/her variable remuneration for acquisition of NIBE-shares. A condition for the extra remuneration is that the senior executive keeps the annually acquired NIBE-shares for at least three years. If this condition is not met  the company is entitled to recover this part of the remuneration. The extra remuner­ation that can be paid for acquiring NIBE-shares aims to increase the senior executives’ long-term commitment to the company and thereby favour the company’s business strategy  long-term interests and sustainability. Normally  the senior executives’ acquisition of NIBE-shares will take place once a year in February/March  by applying the applicable rules against market abuse. The managing director shall not be subject to any incentive programme.Termination of employmentSenior executives shall be employed on a permanent or fixed term basis.The period of notice given by the company to the managing director shall be six months. The managing director shall be entitled to severance payment corresponding to 12 months’ salary.Other senior executives shall receive a salary during a period of notice varying between 6-12 months.There shall be no special agreement stating that a senior executive can leave his/her employment before a certain retirement age and receive a certain part of his/her salary until then.Consideration of salary and terms of employment when preparing the guidelinesWhen preparing the board of directors’ proposal for these guidelines  the average salary and terms of employ­ment for the employees at the Swedish companies in the NIBE group have been taken into account by obtain­ing information regarding the average salary and terms of employment as well as the rate of increase of re­muneration over the period of employment at NIBE. A very important additional factor has been the group’s growth  both in terms of turnover and result. Moreover  a comparison has been made with other Swedish listed companies of the same size. The aforementioned information has been part of the board of directors’ decision-making basis for evaluating the reasonableness of the guidelines.Fees for consultancy services performed by board membersThe company’s board members elected by the general meeting may  in special cases  be remunerated for con­sultancy services within their respective field of competence  which does not constitute board work  for a limited period of time. For these services  a market-based fee shall be paid.How these guidelines have been preparedThese guidelines have been prepared by the board of directors. The managing director and other senior execu­tives have not participated in the board of directors’ preparations and decisions regarding the guidelines.The guidelines are subject to annual review through personal contact by the chairman of the board with the major shareholders.Deviation from the guidelinesThe board of directors may deviate from the guidelines as regards pension  bonus and other benefits if there are special reasons for doing so in an individual case and a deviation is necessary in order to meet the com­pany’s long-term interests and sustainability or to ensure the company’s financial viability.The presence of significant changesThe proposal for guidelines is consistent with the guidelines approved by the Annual General Meeting in 2023. The annual review of the guidelines has not resulted in any significant changes.Available documentsThe annual report and the auditor’s report  complete proposals for decisions concerning items 16 and 17  the auditor’s statement according to Chapter 8 Section 54 of the Swedish Companies Act and other documents will be made available to shareholders at the company’s premises in Markaryd and on the company’s web site  www.nibe.com  no later than 25 April 2024 and will be sent to shareholders requesting it and stating their address.InformationThe shareholders are informed of their right to request information at the Annual General Meeting concerning circumstances that may affect the assessment of an item on the agenda and circumstances that may affect the assessment of the company’s financial situation.Shares and votesAt the time of issuance of this notice  the total number of shares in the company amounts to 2 016 066 488  of which 233 130 360 shares are of class A and 1 782 936 128 shares are of class B.

These conditions will also have been met on the day of the transfer request.Main consequences of the proposed transfer (non-exhaustive list)In accordance with current regulations  McPhy wishes to inform its shareholders of certain possible consequences of this transfer:Protection of minority shareholdersObligation to file the crossing of thresholds. For a period of 3 years from the listing of McPhy shares on Euronext Growth Paris  the obligation to file to the Autorité des Marchés Financiers (""AMF"") and to McPhy the crossing of thresholds of 5%  10%  15%  20%  25%  30%  1/3  50%  2/3  90% and 95% of McPhy's capital or voting rights will be maintained  in accordance with article 223-15-2 of the AMF's General Regulation. At the end of this period  only the crossing of the thresholds of 50% and 90% of McPhy's capital or voting rights will have to be reported to the AMF and the Company  in accordance with Article 223-15-1 of the AMF's General Regulation  subject  where applicable  to the crossing of statutory thresholds to be reported to McPhy.Public tenders. In accordance with the provisions of article 231-1 4° of the AMF's General Regulation  the provisions governing public tenders for shares admitted to trading on Euronext Paris will remain applicable for a period of 3 years from the effective date of their admission to trading on Euronext Growth Paris. This means that a public tender will still have to be filed if the threshold of 30% of the share capital or voting rights is exceeded. At the end of this period  McPhy will be subject to the regulation applicable to companies listed on Euronext Growth Paris  and the obligation to file a public offer will apply if the threshold of 50% of the Company's capital or voting rights is upward crossed.Periodic informationMcPhy will publish  within 4 months of the year-end  a report including its annual statutory and consolidated financial statements  a management report (simplified content) and the Statutory auditors' reports. The Company will also publish a corporate governance report (simplified content).McPhy will also publish  within 4 months of the end of the first semester  a half-year report including its consolidated financial statements and the related activity report.McPhy confirms that it will maintain the same level of quality in its financial information as today and will continue to prepare its consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS standards.Permanent informationMcPhy will continue to be subject to the provisions governing permanent information  which also apply to companies listed on Euronext Growth Paris.McPhy will continue to effectively disseminate regulated information and deliver accurate  precise and truthful information  bringing to the public's attention any information likely to have a significant influence on the share price (inside information)  in accordance with the provisions of Regulation (EU) No. 596-2014 of April 16  2014 on market abuse.In addition  the Company's executives (and persons related to them) will remain subject to the obligation to file any transactions they carry out involving the Company's securities.GovernanceBoard composition. The mandatory rules on parity within the Board of Directors set out in Articles L. 225-18-1 and L. 22-10-3 of the French Commercial Code will no longer apply. It should be noted that McPhy could be subject to these parity rules if it exceeds certain thresholds  which is not currently the case.Compensation of corporate officers. The rules governing the compensation of corporate officers (Say On Pay) set out in Articles L. 22-10-8 et seq. of the French Commercial Code will no longer be mandatory.Audit committee. The Company will no longer be subject to the provisions of Articles L. 821-67 and seq. of the French Commercial Code (previously codified in L. 821-19 and seq. of the French Commercial Code) concerning audit committee.Offices of the Statutory AuditorsThe rules specific to public-interest entities  particularly those relating to seniority limitations  the selection of Statutory Auditors and tendering for their appointment  as set out in Article L. 823-1 II-al. 1 of the French Commercial Code and the provisions of Regulation (EU) n°537/2014 of April 16  2014  will no longer be applicable.Liquidity of the shareAs this is a non-regulated market  the Company draws attention to the fact that the transfer to Euronext Growth Paris could result in a different trend in the liquidity of the shares than the one observed on the Euronext Paris regulated market. The said transfer could also lead certain investors  who give preference to shares of issuers listed on a regulated market  to sell their McPhy shares.Indicative timetable for the proposed transfer (subject to approval by the Combined General Meeting of the Company's shareholders and by Euronext Paris SA):Avril 9  2024 Meeting of the Board of Directors to convene the Combined Shareholders’ Meeting and submit to it  among other things  the proposed transfer of the Company's shares to Euronext Growth Paris Avril 10  2024 Publication of this press release outlining reasons  conditions and consequences of the proposed transfer to Euronext Growth Paris (first press release) May 30  2024 Combined Shareholders’ Meeting to vote on the proposed transfer of listingIn the event of a favorable vote by the Combined Shareholders’ Meeting  meeting of the Board of Directors called to implement the transfer of listing and issue of a second press release June 10  2024 Application filed with Euronext Paris to delist the shares from Euronext Paris and list them on Euronext Growth Paris Starting July 24  2024 Transfer authorization by Euronext Paris SATransfer information document available onlineThird press release from the Company announcing the effective transfer datesPublication by Euronext of a notice of delisting of McPhy shares from Euronext Paris (before trading)Publication by Euronext of a notice of listing of McPhy shares on Euronext Growth Paris (at opening) Earliest on July 30  2024 First listing of McPhy shares on Euronext Growth ParisListing on Euronext Growth Paris would take place at the earliest after the expiration of a period of 2 months from the Combined Shareholders’ Meeting that approved it  i.e. at the earliest on July 30  2024.Next financial event:Combined Shareholders’ Meeting on May 30  2024ABOUT MCPHYSpecialized in hydrogen production and distribution equipment  McPhy is contributing to the global deployment of low-carbon hydrogen as a solution for energy transition.

This approach could unlock new therapeutic avenues for the treatment of inborn metabolic diseases as well as neurological diseases that require delivery of therapeutics to the brain.About HSPCsGene editing in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) has enabled the treatment of multiple previously uncurable genetic diseases. Edited therapeutic HSPCs can engraft in the patient’s bone marrow  self-replicate  differentiate and populate other organs  propagating the therapeutic effects systemically and indefinitely after a single intervention.In this paper  Cellectis developed an intron-specific gene insertion strategy for HSPC  that restricts the expression of a therapeutic protein named IDUA to the myeloid lineage. Edited myeloid cells then act as a Trojan horse to vectorize IDUA across the blood brain barrier and thus  its delivery to the brain. This gene insertion strategy displays minimal genomic footprint and prevents the expression of IDUA by stem cells or other non-myeloid differentiated cells. It could potentially enable the development of efficient therapies for both metabolic and neurological disorders.“This novel TALEN® mediated-intron editing approach rewires the natural ability of myeloid cells to cross the blood brain barrier to efficiently vectorize a genetically encoded-therapeutic protein to the brain. In addition  by inserting the therapeutic transgene in an intronic region of the targeted gene  this approach preserves endogenous gene expression and thus  mitigates the common adverse events observed after gene insertion. This approach is  by essence  versatile and could be used to vectorize an array of therapeutic proteins to the brain and potentially address multiple neurological disorders ” commented Julien Valton  Ph.D.  Vice President of Gene Therapy at Cellectis.Research data showed that:The CD11b intron-specific gene insertion approach efficiently restricts the expression of a desired transgene to the myeloid lineage  preventing its overexpression by stem cells or by other differentiated lineages.The insertion of an IDUA transgene in the first intron of the CD11b gene enables to express IDUA (the enzyme missing in Mucopolysaccharidosis type I patients)  in a myeloid-specific manner without affecting CD11b endogenous expression.Edited HSPC exhibited robust engraftment in the bone marrow of immunodeficient mice  displayed multi-lineage differentiation in various hematopoietic tissues and showed significant presence in the brain as myeloid cells.The article is available on Molecular Therapy website by clicking on this link:https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymthe.2024.04.001About CellectisCellectis is a clinical-stage biotechnology company using its pioneering gene-editing platform to develop life-saving cell and gene therapies.

Stellantis CEO announced an additional €100 million investment today to boost the potential of the iconic Fiat 500e. Mirafiori Automotive Park 2030 is the physical embodiment of Stellantis’ vision of transforming into a sustainable mobility tech company. The site  one of three primary global hubs for Stellantis  has operations that include the entire automotive cycle from design to recycling.Mirafiori is also part of the grEEn-campus transformation program underway at Stellantis and will help save 36 000 tonnes of CO 2 equivalent emissions. The grEEn-campus is a place for exchanging and sharing ideas that promote creativity and efficiency  and ultimately create a highly desirable work environment. The reimagined spaces directly support Stellantis’ carbon net zero by 2038 target outlined in its Dare Forward 2030 strategy.“Stellantis draws on its origins in Italy  France and the United States to drive its worldwide operations ” said Carlos Tavares  Stellantis CEO. “But Mirafiori is unique among Stellantis’ roots as it is becoming a fully-fledged center gathering central functions  technology development  manufacturing and circular economy activities. This is why its deep transformation  with eight new activities in Turin since we created Stellantis  requires a lot of attention  training and investment to continue delivering vehicles  technology and services that win the hearts and minds of our customers worldwide. In parallel to the launch of eDCT production  today’s announcement of an additional €100 million investment serves the ambition to further enhance the attractiveness and affordability of the Fiat 500e to enlarge the customer base  thus enlarging the Mirafiori manufacturing activity. As demonstrated today  we intend to defend our leadership position in Italy against all competition  including Chinese manufacturers  whatever support they may benefit from in the country. Every day our Italian employees are demonstrating their skills  their fighting spirit and their resilience. I want to thank them warmly and sincerely for their support of Stellantis. Stakeholders can expect that we’ll continue to protect and nurture our roots in new and sometimes surprising ways.”Mirafiori Automotive Park 2030 is the next chapter in the historic site’s rich  80-year history. Today it is the production location for the Abarth 500e  Fiat 500e  Maserati GranTurismo  and Maserati GranCabrio and more than 90% of the vehicles built there are exported  contributing to Italy’s trade balance.In 2023  FIAT increased its global sales volume by 12%  registering a total of 1.35 million units sold worldwide and confirming it as the leading Stellantis brand in terms of sales volume. The brand is leading in four markets with a share of 21.8% in Brazil  12.8% in Italy  15.7% in Turkey and 78.6% in Algeria. FIAT is the leader in the A-segment in Europe with a 42% market share and the newly announced investment in the 500e aims to strengthen the model’s leadership by offering a more enhanced customer experience with a more affordable option featuring an all-new battery and electric engine.Along with the onsite vehicle production  for FIAT and Maserati brands  the Mirafiori Automotive Park 2030 includes:Transmission/Gearbox Production: In addition to the existing production of the C514 manual gearbox for the Fiat Panda built in Pomigliano  Italy  the eTransmissions Assembly joint venture today launched eDCT production for Stellantis-brand hybrid powertrains in less than two years.

These represented total sales of around €6m for the year.Excluding perimeter effects linked to acquisitions and non-recurring items  proforma growth in the core business was 12%.The integration of GenDx over a full year led to a sharp increase in the share of proprietary products to 30% of 2023 revenues  compared with 18% in 2022.Another effect of the integration of GenDx combined with the other acquisitions  the most recent of which are BMD (Belgium  2022) and DID (Italy  2023)  is that the share of international revenues has risen from 25% of core business in 2022 to 38% in 2023.The gross operating margin  before the non-recurring effect of the sale of GenDx inventories allocated as part of the PPA (purchase price allocation)  rose to 47.6% in 2023  compared to 46.7% in 2022.Resilient results against a background of increased R&D and inflationThe integration of GenDx's development activities has created a leading-edge team in molecular biology and bioinformatics  resulting in a 70% increase in R&D expenditure to €5.9m. Marketing and selling expenses remained stable (-2%) at €19.2m  while general and administrative expenses rose by 25%  mainly due to the integration of GenDx and BMD on a full-year basis and of DID from July 3  2023.As a result  EBITDA adjusted for the effects of the inventories allocated to PPA came to €27.3m (21% of revenues)  down 33% compared with 2022  which still included a very significant proportion of COVID business.Operating profit adjusted for the effects of the PPA and goodwill amortization came to €22.5m  down 39% on the previous year.With financial debt linked to the loans used to finance external growth  and cash remunerated at an interest rate lower than the debt rate  financial income was negative at €1.7m.Exceptional items totalled €1.4m  mainly as a result of write-downs on GenDx balance sheet items.Net profit for 2023 was therefore €4.8m.Free cash flow of €26.4mWith an €18.4m cash flow from operations  combined with an €8.4m reduction in working capital mainly due to the end of the COVID business  Eurobio Scientific generated an operating cash flow of €26.8m in 2023 (€43.1m in 2022).Cash flow from investment activities included -€2.2m from net acquisitions of fixed assets  and -€4.5m from the inclusion of DID in the scope of consolidation. These flows were largely offset by the repayment of guarantee deposits of €6.3m made in connection with foreign exchange transactions. As a result  with a net cash outflow of -€0.3m linked to investments  free cash flow amounted to €26.4m.At the end of December 2023  Eurobio Scientific had an €89m cash position and a financial debt (excluding finance leases) of €94.5m  leading to a net financial debt of €5.5m  compared with €22m a year earlier.Continued strategic deploymentWith a good resilience of its results despite the end of the COVID business and a background of integration of strategic acquisitions  Eurobio Scientific is continuing to deploy its three strategic priorities: development of proprietary products  internationalization  and opening up of new markets. Their aim is to enable the Group to continue its development  with both growth in sales and increase in margins.Next financial meetingAnnual General Meeting: June 13  2024About Eurobio ScientificEurobio Scientific is a key player in the field of specialty in vitro diagnostics.

BONE SURGERY RTU 31cc and OSTEOSARCOMA RTU 212cc have significantly contributed to these figures with 49% of the total units sold. BIOCERA-VET ® COMBO CLEAN launched in Europe in May 2023 and in the United States in October 2023 already accounted for 5% of a total units sold in 2023. BIOCERA-VET ® OSTEOSARCOMA RTU and BONE SURGERY RTU sales increased respectively by 68% and by 50% in 2023 as compared to 2022. In 2023  173 units were sold in North America (USA and Canada) for 23% of total sold units  representing a 6-fold increase compared to 2022.First quarter of 2024 BIOCERA-VET ® sales were flat at 206 units compared to first quarter of 2023 and decreased by 9% compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. While the number of BIOCERA-VET ® BONE SURGERY units sold increased (vs. year ago and quarter over quarter)  the product range sale was impacted by BIOCERA-VET ® OSTEOSARCOMA. In the United States  the designation of the University of Florida  previously a customer  as the site of the clinical study2 measuring the efficacy of cementoplasty with BIOCERA-VET ® OSTEOSARCOMA  weighed on the volume of business generated by this product. In Europe  sales of BIOCERA-VET ® OSTEOSARCOMA were affected by the reduction in the number of patients treated  but a marked increase in requests from owners (+18%) should result in purchases by veterinary surgeons in the 2nd quarter  pointing to a rebound by the end of the half-year.The 36% increase in indirect sales recorded (compared with fourth quarter of 2023) was mainly due to the significant growth in United Kingdom (+60%) since the third and fourth quarters of 2023.First sales of BIOCERA-VET Equine  launched on March 13  2024  was registered during this 2024 first quarter.About TheraVet SATheraVet is a veterinary biotechnology company specializing in osteoarticular treatments for companion animals.

People with HS also experience stigma: worrying about or directly experiencing negative attitudes and reactions from society in response to their symptoms.4 These feelings can lead to embarrassment  social isolation  low self-esteem  and sexual life impairment  and impact all areas of life  including interpersonal relationships  education  and work.3For further information  contact UCB:U.S. CommunicationsNicole HergaT +1.773.960.5349email Nicole.Herga@ucb.comAbout UCBUCB  Brussels  Belgium (www.ucb.com) is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of innovative medicines and solutions to transform the lives of people living with severe diseases of the immune system or of the central nervous system.

By their nature  such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and assumptions which might cause the actual results  financial condition  performance or achievements of UCB  or industry results  to differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Important factors that could result in such differences include: changes in general economic  business and competitive conditions  the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing  costs associated with research and development  changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB  effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations  safety  quality  data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches  or disruptions of our information technology systems  product liability claims  challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates  competition from other products including biosimilars  changes in laws or regulations  exchange rate fluctuations  changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws  and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline  will progress to product approval or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far  the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models  cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products  which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to differences disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB's efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also  UCB or others could discover safety  side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB's products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover  sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment  including pricing pressure  political and public scrutiny  customer and prescriber patterns or practices  and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes. Finally  a breakdown  cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality  integrity and availability of UCB's data and systems.Given these uncertainties  you should not place undue reliance on any of such forward-looking statements. There can be no guarantee that the investigational or approved products described in this press release will be submitted or approved for sale or for any additional indications or labelling in any market  or at any particular time  nor can there be any guarantee that such products will be or will continue to be commercially successful in the future.UCB is providing this information  including forward-looking statements  only as of the date of this press release. UCB expressly disclaims any duty to update any information contained in this press release  either to confirm the actual results or to report or reflect any change in its forward-looking statements with regard thereto or any change in events  conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based  unless such statement is required pursuant to applicable laws and regulations.Additionally  information contained in this document shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities  nor shall there be any offer  solicitation or sale of securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer  solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to the registration or qualification under the securities laws of such jurisdiction.References_ _ _ _ _1 Jemec GBE.

Photograph: Luke MacGregor/BloombergSmurfit Kappa’s decision to postpone the retirement of chairman Irial Finan  who has already served beyond corporate governance norms  has been accepted by a leading investor advisory firm as the paper packaging giant proceeds with a plan to merge with US peer WestRock.Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS)  which advises large investors globally on how to vote at annual general meetings (agms)  said in a report that Smurfit Kappa’s explanation for Mr Finan remaining at the helm “is acknowledged”. It recommends that shareholders support his re-election at the company’s upcoming agm on April 26th.Mr Finan has been a director of Smurfit Kappa for the past 12 years. The UK Corporate Governance Code  recognised by Euronext Dublin as a standard for good governance  says non-executive directors should serve no longer than nine years.Smurfit Kappa carried out a comprehensive review of the chairman’s tenure in 2021 as it reached the nine-year mark  concluding it was in the best interests of the company and shareholders that it be extended by up to three years to early 2025.READ MOREHowever  the cardboard box maker said in its latest annual report that it has postponed the succession process as “continuity of the chair position during this time of significant change for the company was critical”.Smurfit Kappa announced last September that it plans to merge with WestRock to create the world’s biggest packaging group with $34 billion (€31.2 billion) of sales. The deal  effectively a takeover  is expected to be completed in early July  subject to approval by shareholders in both companies. Smurfit Kappa has yet to say when it will hold an extraordinary general meeting on the matter.The deal was unveiled as the cardboard box industry was in the middle of a cyclical downturn  following unprecedented activity during the Covid pandemic when demand for physical goods – from giant TVs to patio furniture – spiked amid lockdowns. Smurfit Kappa’s full-year box sales volumes fell by 3.5 per cent last year  though it returned to growth in the fourth quarter.Industry consolidation is gathering pace. US packaging giant International Paper (IP)  which mounted an unwanted Smurfit Kappa bid in 2018 that was ultimately abandoned  is reportedly closing in on a £5.72 billion (€6.68 billion) formal offer this week for UK-based DS Smith.[ Smurfit Kappa executives get €10m in share awards under bonus schemes ]IP made an approach after another London-listed packaging group Mondi had agreed a £5.14 billion takeover of DS Smith. The door remains open for Mondi to improve its offer.The tie-up agreement between Smurfit Kappa and WestRock sees the Irish company’s chief executive  Tony Smurfit  and chief financial officer  Ken Bowles  remain as the top two executives of combined group. It also envisages a delisting in Dublin as the enlarged group takes on a primary US listing.Mr Smurfit’s total remuneration fell by 15 per cent last year to €4.72 million  while Mr Bowles’s declined 12 per cent to €2.69 million as the company’s earnings declined.,neutral,0.02,0.6,0.38,mixed,0.2,0.29,0.51,True,English,"['Smurfit Kappa', 'shareholder adviser', 'chairman', 'The UK Corporate Governance Code', 'US packaging giant International Paper', 'leading investor advisory firm', 'up to three years', 'full-year box sales volumes', 'London-listed packaging group Mondi', 'unwanted Smurfit Kappa bid', 'paper packaging giant', 'corporate governance norms', 'primary US listing', 'cardboard box maker', 'biggest packaging group', 'Institutional Shareholder Services', 'annual general meetings', 'extraordinary general meeting', 'top two executives', 'cardboard box industry', 'US rival WestRock', 'US peer WestRock', 'chief financial officer', 'latest annual report', 'UK-based DS Smith', 'chairman Irial Finan', 'Smurfit Kappa executives', 'good governance', 'giant TVs', 'past 12 years', 'nine years', 'Mr Finan', 'Industry consolidation', 'chief executive', 'combined group', 'Tony Smurfit', 'Mr Smurfit', 'Luke MacGregor', 'large investors', 'upcoming agm', 'April 26th', 'non-executive directors', 'comprehensive review', 'nine-year mark', 'best interests', 'READ MORE', 'succession process', 'chair position', 'significant change', 'early July', 'cyclical downturn', 'unprecedented activity', 'Covid pandemic', 'physical goods', 'patio furniture', '3.5 per cent', 'fourth quarter', 'share awards', 'bonus schemes', 'tie-up agreement', 'Ken Bowles', 'total remuneration', '15 per cent', 'Mr Bowles', 'Euronext Dublin', 'formal offer', 'Irish company', '£5.14 billion takeover', 'exit', 'continuity', 'time', 'Photograph', 'Bloomberg', 'decision', 'retirement', 'plan', 'ISS', 'agms', 'helm', 'shareholders', 'election', 'standard', 'tenure', 'world', 'deal', 'approval', 'companies', 'matter', 'middle', 'demand', 'lockdowns', 'growth', 'pace', 'IP', 'approach', 'door', 'delisting', 'earnings']",2024-04-10,2024-04-11,irishtimes.com

This causes major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care  they become ineffective  untolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing ""diuretic-resistant"" patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  delivering major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients and reducing costs for healthcare systems.The Company's Premarket Approval (PMA) application for the alfapump was submitted to the US FDA in December 2023 and accepted for substantive review in January 2024  having reported positive primary and secondary endpoint data from the North American pivotal POSEIDON study in recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis.Results of the Company's RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure support DSR's mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE  a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study  have been successfully treated with DSR  resulting in a dramatic improvement in diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements. The independent Data Safety Monitoring Board approved the start of the randomized MOJAVE cohort of up to a further 30 patients  which is planned after alfapump US PMA approval.Sequana Medical is listed on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent  Belgium. For further information  please visit www.sequanamedical.com.Important Regulatory DisclaimersThe alfapump® system is currently not approved in the United States or Canada. In the United States and Canada  the alfapump system is currently under clinical investigation (POSEIDON Trial) and is being studied in adult patients with refractory or recurrent ascites due to liver cirrhosis. DSR® therapy is still in development and it should be noted that any statements regarding safety and efficacy arise from ongoing pre-clinical and clinical investigations which have yet to be completed. There is no link between DSR therapy and ongoing investigations with the alfapump system in Europe  the United States or Canada.Note: alfapump® and DSR® are registered trademarks.Forward-looking statementsThis press release may contain predictions  estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking statements.Such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance.

This causes major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care  they become ineffective  untolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing ""diuretic-resistant"" patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  delivering major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients and reducing costs for healthcare systems.The Company's Premarket Approval (PMA) application for the alfapump was submitted to the US FDA in December 2023 and accepted for substantive review in January 2024  having reported positive primary and secondary endpoint data from the North American pivotal POSEIDON study in recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis.Results of the Company's RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure support DSR's mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE  a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study  have been successfully treated with DSR  resulting in a dramatic improvement in diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements. The independent Data Safety Monitoring Board approved the start of the randomized MOJAVE cohort of up to a further 30 patients  which is planned after alfapump US PMA approval.Sequana Medical is listed on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels.Important Regulatory DisclaimersThe alfapump® system is currently not approved in the United States or Canada. In the United States and Canada  the alfapump system is currently under clinical investigation (POSEIDON Trial) and is being studied in adult patients with refractory or recurrent ascites due to liver cirrhosis. DSR® therapy is still in development and it should be noted that any statements regarding safety and efficacy arise from ongoing pre-clinical and clinical investigations which have yet to be completed. There is no link between DSR therapy and ongoing investigations with the alfapump system in Europe  the United States or Canada.Note: alfapump® and DSR® are registered trademarks.Forward-looking statementsThis press release may contain predictions  estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking statements.Such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance.
