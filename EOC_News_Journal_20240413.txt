European allies have resisted Washington’s initial plan to simply confiscate Moscow’s frozen funds.Western nations have blocked some $300 billion of Russian sovereign assets  most of them in the Belgium-based central securities depository Euroclear. The US government has advocated for the money to be expropriated and given to Ukraine – a step that Russia has said would amount to theft. Officials in the EU are concerned about the legality of the proposed move  as well as its potentially devastating effect on the Western financial system.European nations are considering whether to take profits from frozen Russian assets and use them to fund weapons and reconstruction projects for Ukraine. However  the same proceeds could be better used as collateral for loans  US Deputy National Security Adviser for International Economics Daleep Singh reportedly argued during a visit to Kiev on Wednesday.“Instead of just transferring the yearly profits from the reserves… it’s conceptually possible to transfer the ten years of profits or 30 years of profits ” the official said  as quoted by the FT. “The present value of those profits adds up to a very large number.”Leveraging future profits to receive credit now would allow the West to “supersize the value of these income flows over time ” Singh claimed.A European official told the newspaper that based on an expected revenue of €50 billion to €60 billion ($53 billion-$64 billion)  a bond could generate up to €40 billion today  but warned that this was heavily dependent on future interest rates.Creditors would also likely have concerns that the Ukraine conflict would be resolved within several years in a deal entailing the return of Russian assets  the report added. State guarantees may address that  but such loan terms could be challenged in some Western jurisdictions  the FT said.The US has insisted that Moscow’s funds will not be returned until Kiev is satisfied. “Russia must pay for the damage it has caused in Ukraine. And it is not for Russia to decide if or when that happens ” Singh said during his trip to Kiev.Moscow has warned that it will retaliate if its assets are confiscated by the West.,neutral,0.12,0.73,0.16,negative,0.02,0.29,0.69,True,English,"['softer alternative', 'US', 'Moscow', 'reserves', 'Belgium-based central securities depository Euroclear', 'US Deputy National Security Adviser', 'Russian central bank assets', 'senior White House official', 'future interest rates', 'Russian sovereign assets', 'frozen Russian assets', 'Western financial system', 'Leveraging future profits', 'senior official', 'Financial Times', 'US government', 'The US', 'Western nations', 'Western jurisdictions', 'European official', 'European allies', 'initial plan', 'devastating effect', 'European nations', 'reconstruction projects', 'same proceeds', 'International Economics', 'large number', 'income flows', 'State guarantees', 'loan terms', 'ten years', 'several years', 'yearly profits', 'present value', 'The West', 'Daleep Singh', 'Ukraine conflict', '30 years', 'debt', 'behalf', 'Washington', 'Moscow', 'funds', 'money', 'step', 'theft', 'Officials', 'legality', 'move', 'weapons', 'collateral', 'loans', 'visit', 'Kiev', 'Wednesday', 'reserves', 'credit', 'newspaper', 'revenue', 'bond', 'concerns', 'deal', 'return', 'report', 'damage', 'trip']",2024-04-12,2024-04-13,rt.com

In quest'ambito  il consiglio d'amministrazione può emettere nuove azioni per mezzo di una assunzione a fermo (""Festübernahme"") attraverso un istituto bancario  un sindacato di banche o un'altra terza parte con una conseguente offerta di queste azioni agli azionisti. Il consiglio d'amministrazione può far scadere diritti d'opzione che non sono ancora stati esercitati. Esso può inoltre allocare tali diritti e/o azioni - per cui sono stati accordati diritti d'opzione ma non sono stati esercitati - a condizioni di mercato o utilizzarli per altri scopi nell'interesse della Società.3Il consiglio d'amministrazione è inoltre autorizzato a limitare o negare i diritti d'opzione degli azionisti e conferire tali diritti a parti terze  qualora le azioni debbano essere utilizzate:a) per l'acquisizione di un'impresa  di parti di un'impresa  o partecipazioni  o per nuovi investimenti  oppure  nel caso di un piazzamento di azioni  per finanziare o rifinanziare tali transazioni; oppureb) con l'obiettivo di ampliare la cerchia degli azionisti in relazione ad una quotazione di azioni ad una borsa nazionale o estera o con l'obiettivo di permettere la partecipazione di partner strategici; oppurec) per l'emissione di azioni in favore di dipendenti o di membri del consiglio d'amministrazione della Società o delle società del gruppo sulla base di piani di incentivazione azionari approvati dal consiglio d'amministrazione.1The Board of Directors shall be authorized to increase the share capital in an amount not to exceed CHF 6'597'024.00 through the issuance of up to 9'424'320 fully paid registered shares with a par value of CHF 0.70 per share by not later than June 2  2024.

Il consiglio di amministrazione può emettere nuove azioni sottoscritte da una banca o da altri terzi con una conseguente offerta di queste azioni agli azionisti esistenti. Il consiglio di amministrazione è autorizzato a limitare o vietare la negoziazione dei diritti di opzione delle nuove azioni. In caso di mancato esercizio dei diritti di opzione  il consiglio di amministrazione può  a sua discrezione  lasciare che tali diritti scadano senza valore  oppure allocare tali diritti o le azioni a cui danno diritto ai titolari  al prezzo di mercato o in altro modo nell'interesse della Società.3Il consiglio di amministrazione è autorizzato a negare o limitare i diritti d'opzione degli azionisti e allocare tali diritti a determinati azionisti o parti terze:a) nella misura in cui le azioni vengono utilizzate per l'acquisizione di società  divisioni aziendali o partecipazioni o per il finanziamento o il rifinanziamento di tali transazioni  in relazione a operazioni di partenariato e cooperazione strategica  per una raccolta rapida e flessibile di fondi tramite piazzamento di azioni  la conversione di prestiti o titoli in azioni  il finanziamento di nuovi progetti di investimento della società  l'acquisizione o il finanziamento di prodotti  proprietà intellettuali o licenze o il finanziamento di iniziative strategiche;b) con l'obiettivo di ampliare la cerchia degli azionisti in relazione ad una quotazione di azioni ad una borsa nazionale o estera o con l'obiettivo di permettere la partecipazione di partner strategici;c) per l'emissione di azioni in favore di dipendenti o di membri del consiglio d'amministrazione della Società o delle società del gruppo sulla base di piani di incentivazione azionari approvati dal consiglio d'amministrazione; oppured) in caso di piazzamento nazionale o internazionale (anche privato) di azioni a condizioni di mercato.4Se il capitale azionario aumento a seguito di un aumento tramite capitale condizionale ai sensi degli art. 4quater  4quinquies  4sexies  4 septies  4octies  il limite massimo del margine di variazione del capitale e il numero massimo di nuove azioni che possono essere emesse dal margine di variazione del capitale aumenterà in misura corrispondente.1The Board of Directors is authorised  to conduct one or more increases of the share capital at any time until 4 June 2026 up to the upper limit of CHF 82'155'943.00  corresponding to 117'365'633 registered shares with a par value of CHF 0.70 each to be fully paid up.2In case of a capital increase  the following applies:The Board of Directors shall determine the amount of share capital to be issued  the type of contribution  the date of issue  the conditions governing the exercise of subscription rights and the commencement of dividend entitlement. The Board of Directors may issue new shares which are underwritten by a bank or other third party and subsequently offered to existing shareholders. The Board of Directors is authorised to restrict or to prohibit trading in the subscription rights to the new shares. In the event of subscription rights not being exercised  the Board of Directors may  at its discretion  either allow such rights to expire worthless  or place them or the shares to which they entitle their holders either at market prices or in some other manner commensurate with the interests of the Company.3The Board of Directors is authorized to withdraw or limit the subscription rights of shareholders and to allocate subscription rights to individual shareholders or third parties:a) of the new shares being used to acquire companies  parts there-of or participations  or for the financing or refinancing of such transactions  in connection with strategic partnering and co-operation transactions  for quick and flexible raising of funds by way of share placement  for the conversion of loans or securities into shares  for the financing of new investment projects undertaken  the acquisition or financing of products  intellectual property or licenses  or the financing of strategic initiatives undertaken by the Company;b) of the new shares being used either to extend the shareholder base in conjunction with the listing of the shares on any stock exchange to increase the free float or for investment by strategic partners;c) for the issuance of shares to employees or directors of the Company or of the group companies pursuant to share based incentive plans approved by the Board of Directors; ord) of the new shares being placed nationally or internationally (including by way of private placement) at market conditions.4If the share capital increases as a result of an increase from contingent share capital pursuant to art. 4quater  4quinquies  4sexies  4 septies  4octies  the upper limit of the capital band as well as the maximum number of new shares that can be issued out of the capital band shall increase in an amount corresponding to such increase in the share capital. Explanation The revision of Swiss Corporate Law introduced the so-called capital band  which from a practical perspective corresponds to the previous authorized capital that shall be eliminated. Under the capital band  the general meeting can authorize the Board of Directors to increase or decrease the share capital within a certain range - 150% (ceiling) to 50% (floor) are legally permitted - of the share capital registered in the commercial register upon the introduction of the capital band. The authorization is limited by law to five years. The general meeting has the right to directly cancel the subscription rights of the shareholders or can delegate this right to the Board of Directors  provided that the general meeting expressly nominates the reasons for the cancellation of the subscription rights in the Articles of Association. To replace the authorized capital of Cavotec SA  which expires in June 2024  and is no longer renewable under the new Swiss Corporate Law  the Board of Directors proposes therefore the introduction of a capital band for a maximum of two years in the Articles of Association. In line with the previously existing authorized capital  the proposed ceiling of the capital band is to be set at 110% of the share capital currently registered in the commercial register. The maximum number of shares that can be issued will be regularly adjusted by the Board of Directors after a capital increase within the capital band. As with the previous authorized capital  the Board of Directors are also to be given the right under the capital band to cancel shareholders' subscription rights in connection with capital increases. 7.

(NASDAQ: VEON  Euronext Amsterdam: VEON)  a global digital operator that provides converged connectivity and online services  today announces an increase in management’s ownership of VEON shares through awards under its existing equity incentive-based compensation plans. VEON is utilising certain of the 92 459 532 common shares issued to VEON Holdings BV  announced on 1 March 2024  to satisfy the awards made.Augie Fabela  Chair of the Remuneration and Governance Committee  commented on the awards set out in the table below  saying  ""The equity awards are a testament to our belief in aligning management's incentives with value creation and shareholder returns. These awards recognize the contributions and key roles of our top three executives in successfully driving future success for the VEON Group.”Figures represent the ADS equivalents of VEON common shares awarded Short-Term Incentive 20231 Project Award2 Special Award3 Long-Term Incentive 2024 Award4 Kaan Terzioglu 57 248 240 169 Joop Brakenhoff 10 515 8 778 2 102 95 913 Omiyinka Doris 5 832 7 524 82 211In connection with these above mentioned share awards  VEON’s Group Executive Committee (“GEC”) received a total of 2 299 995 VEON common shares (equal to 91 999 VEON American Depositary Shares (“ADSs”)) within the scope of the VEON’s Deferred Share plans  and the GEC were granted a total of 10 457 359 VEON common shares (equal to 418 294 ADSs) as a part of the LTI plans. The grant amounts set out in the table above reflect the net award amounts transferred to each of the GEC members after deducting shares to cover withholding taxes (as applicable)  save for the LTI 2024 awards which are unvested and reflect the gross award amounts.As previously announced  GEC members are required to accrue and maintain a minimum level of VEON shares. This will be equivalent to 6.0x the annual base salary for the Group CEO and 2.0x the annual base salary for the other GEC members.1 The STI 2023 share awards were granted as part of VEON’s Deferred Share Plan. The Deferred Share grant  which represents 50% of the Short-Term Incentives (“STI”) scheme  relates to the period from 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2023 and is deferred into shares under the Deferred Share grant rules. The shares vested immediately and are required to be held for period of two years from 16 February 2024.2 A ‘Project Award’ was granted as part of VEON’s Deferred Share Plan to Joop Brakenhoff and Omiyinka Doris for their contributions to successfully completing a key project. The shares vested immediately and are required to be held for one year from 5 March 2024.3 A ‘Special Award’ was granted to GEC member  Joop Brakenhoff  as part of VEON’s Deferred Share Plan granted in December 2021 and is now fully vested.4 The Long-Term Incentive (“LTI”) 2024 share grant is awarded in relation to the three-year period from 1 January 2024 to 31 December 2026. The vesting of these shares is linked to the relative TSR performance to VEON’s peer group which will be assessed at the end of the plan period.About VEONVEON is a digital operator that provides converged connectivity and digital services to nearly 160 million customers.

39208,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2024/04/12/real-iseq-20-market-value-is-more-than-double-official-lists-100bn/,‘Real’ Iseq 20 market value is more than double official list’s €100bn,Exits of heavyweights from Dublin stock market have triggered concern in the industry as to its future viability,The total market capitalisation of Iseq 20 is now just over €100 billion  having shrunk dramatically in the past six months following the exits of the two largest groups on the market – CRH and Flutter Entertainment. Illustration: Paul ScottMalin Corporation  the life sciences investment firm cofounded by former Elan chief executive Kelly Martin after overseeing the pharma group’s $8.6 billion (€8 billion) sale to US peer Perrigo in 2013  floated on the Irish stock market nine years ago with great hopes.The premise was simple: invest in a small portfolio of promising companies  keep its own costs down to a minimum and wait to reap the profits.While the stock would jump 50 per cent over the first 15 months after its IPO  it didn’t take long for the market to become concerned about the ragbag of investments in start-ups across various fields of life sciences and Malin’s high head-office costs.Martin’s contract was terminated in late 2017 and a strategic review the following year – after a wider management and board overhaul – saw it focus on less than a handful of priority investments.READ MORESince late 2021  Malin has returned €236 million of cash to shareholders as it has sold down investments – including stakes Immunocore  which is focused on developing cancer treatments  and eczema-targeting Kymab. It values its remaining portfolio at €124 million.Malin  with a market value of just €113 million  is today the smallest component of the Iseq 20  an index established 19 years ago this week for the largest Dublin-listed companies.Its days on the index are numbered as it continues to eye “realisation” opportunities for its remaining investments and further cash returns to shareholders. But the Iseq 20 has bigger problems.The total market capitalisation of Iseq 20 is now just over €100 billion  having shrunk dramatically in the past six months following the exits of the two largest groups on the market – CRH and Flutter Entertainment.[ Irish stock market trading turnover slumps 30% in February after CRH and Flutter exits ]Between them  CRH and Flutter have a market capitalisation equivalent to about €85 billion  with each having increased in value since they took on listings on Wall Street  where stocks typically trade at a premium to European shares  relative to earnings.US-listed stocks trade on an average of 21 times’ company earnings  compared to a ratio of 14 for European equities and 12 for the UK.The moves are also down to the fact that North America now accounts for three-quarters of CRH’s earnings  while Flutter’s fast-growing US fantasy sports website  FanDuel  is increasingly pulling the group’s centre of gravity across the Atlantic.The Iseq 20 will be further hollowed out over the summer as Smurfit Kappa  with a market value of about €11 billion  prepares to drop its Irish listing under a planned merger with US cardboard box-making peer WestRock.[ Smurfit Kappa's Irish stock market exit compounds existential crisis ]“Right now  you have a G1 world in capital markets where the US accounts for over 70 per cent of the MSCI World Index ” said Noel O’Halloran  chief investment officer with KBI Global Investors in Dublin. G1 refers to group of one.“Wall Street is acting like a magnet for companies that believe they’ll be rewarded more for listing there. Whether that’s an illusion or not remains to be seen.”Barry Glavin  head of equity investment platform at Amundi in Dublin  said the recent heavyweight exits “seem to be primarily driven by the scale of their existing US activities  their future growth opportunities in that market and their assessment that a US listing is important to capturing those opportunities”.The number of listed companies in London has shrunk by more than 25 per cent over the past 10 years... This has been driven by private equity-fuelled buyouts of public companies and the growing attraction  particularly in the wake of Brexit  of the US and other markets‘Real’ ISEQ 20As it stands  the market cap of the official Iseq 20 is now less than half the €220 billion combined value of the 20 largest Irish public companies listed on stock exchanges on both sides of the Atlantic  according to Irish Times calculations.This alternative  or “real”  Iseq 20 would be led by CRH  Flutter  Ryanair and clinical trials group Icon  which ditched its Irish listing in 2012 for a fully fledged one on the Nasdaq.It would also include fuel-to-technology supplying conglomerate DCC and Woodie’s and Chadwicks owner Grafton Group  both of which are listed in London.New York-quoted Dole plc  formed in 2021 through the merger of Fyffes spin-out Total Produce with Dole Foods  would also make the list.It also takes in companies such as Zurich-listed bakery group Aryzta and New York-quoted drink cans group Ardagh Metal Packaging  which are domiciled in Switzerland and Luxembourg respectively but have Irish roots and retain some significant functions in Dublin.However  it excludes companies that moved their registered headquarters to the Republic for tax reasons in recent decades or are the product of tax inversion deals that were all the rage in the early 2010s. Examples include Perrigo’s purchase of Elan or the world’s largest medical devices business  Medtronic  which is now a Dublin-domiciled business following its 2015 takeover of Covidien.Current Iseq 20 components Uniphar  Glenveagh Properties  Ires Reit  FBD  FD Technologies  Kenmare Resources  Origin Enterprises and Malin  wouldn’t make the cut.London woesThe recent Irish exits for New York come a decade after a slew of companies – including DCC  sandwich maker Greencore  and Grafton Group – ditched their local listings for the then bright lights of London.The more recent shrinking of the Irish market  however  is more a reflection of a crisis at the London Stock Exchange. The number of listed companies in London has shrunk by more than 25 per cent over the past 10 years  according to research from trading platform XTB. This has been driven by private equity-fuelled buyouts of public companies and the growing attraction  particularly in the wake of Brexit  of the US and other markets.O’Halloran said the exodus by a number of Irish companies to London a decade ago had not paid off for them.“The companies would be no better or worse off today had they retained their main listings in Dublin. Of course  Brexit – and its impact on the UK economy and capital market – has had a major impact ” he said. “We’ve seen a derating of the UK market since Brexit.”Plumbing supplier Ferguson quit the FTSE 100 in 2022 for a primary listings in New York. And UK computer chip designer Arm shunned London last year to pursue an initial public offering and flotation on the Nasdaq.While there had been speculation that Swedish buy-now-pay-later group Klarna was gearing towards a London IPO after it set up a UK holding company in November  its chief executive Sebastian Siemiatkowski has since indicated that a US flotation was more likely. UK pollster YouGov has also threatened to shift its listing from London to New York.CRH is among the companies to move its main quotation from London to New York as part of its listings rejig  resulting in its exit from the blue-chip FTSE 100 as it eyes access to the S&P 500  the index most followed by investors worldwide. Flutter plans to follow suit  subject to shareholder approval at its annual general meeting in May.The move will “give greater access to much deeper capital markets” and provide “greater overall liquidity in Flutter shares”  the company said in an agm notice to shareholders.Back in Dublin  the average daily value of shares traded on Euronext  which operates the Irish stock market  plunged by 30 per cent in the year to February  following the departures of CRH and Flutter in September and January  respectively.The departures contributed to the Republic’s two largest securities firms  Davy and Goodbody Stockbrokers  each shedding jobs in their capital businesses over the past six months.Dublin and London have company in their misery. In the past six months  the likes of Finnish sports-brand group Amer Sports  which owns Wilson tennis racquets and Salomon skis  and German sandal maker Birkenstock also listed in New York.IPO droughtTo make matters worse  flotations in Dublin have been few and far between in recent times.Only three companies have floated on the Irish exchange in the past five years: Uniphar  the healthcare group; Corre Energy  a developer of underground storage solutions for renewable energy; and medtech firm HealthBeacon  which succumbed to examinership last October and ended up being taken over by US home appliances group Hamilton Beach.The Republic doesn’t have a natural group of large institutional investors these days for IPO prospects to target to anchor share sales.A coterie of Irish pensions and investment groups – such as Irish Life Investment Managers  AIB Investment Managers  Hibernian Investment Managers and Ulster Bank Investment Managers – typically acted “cornerstone investors” in IPOs in the 1980s and 1990s  taking large chunks of the new shares on offer.However  a triple whammy since then of Irish pension funds being pressed by advisory firms to lower their exposure to Irish equities  foreign takeovers of the main local players and a general shift by the industry from active stock-picking to passive investment – where funds track stock market benchmarks – has all but killed off this old port of call.Companies listed on the Irish exchange contributed €12.4 billion to the domestic economy in 2022 and employed or supported almost 90 000 jobs across the State  the Grant Thornton report saidOfficials from Euronext Dublin and the wider Irish capital markets ecosystem are developing a detailed pitch for the Government to help reboot the IPO market  sources familiar with the project said last month.They are seeking to flesh out proposals submitted last year but which met resistance in the Department of Finance  as they were not developed enough. That report  written by Grant Thornton  called for the establishment of type of cornerstone fund to participate in IPOs  tax incentives for retail investors to put money into public companies and tax breaks for founders or owners of companies that join the market. The hope is that that pitch will be ready for submission by the end of this month  according to sources.The Grant Thornton report said a domestic exchange was “critical to supporting local enterprise”. Companies listed on the Irish exchange contributed €12.4 billion to the domestic economy in 2022 and employed or supported almost 90 000 jobs across the State  it said.“Enterprise Ireland has backed about 6 000 companies in the past decade as part of Government strategy to support and grow indigenous Irish business. Having a viable stock exchange is a logical extension of that strategy  to secure further growth capital for companies that choose to stay independent and base themselves in Ireland ” said Joe Gill  director of origination and corporate broking with Goodbody Stockbrokers.But there are bigger  global forces at play. Most western markets – including the US – have seen their lists of investible public companies shrink in recent decades as many public companies and would-be IPO prospects succumbed to the attractions of private equity money and trade sales in an era – until recently – of ultra-low interest rates.The number of listed companies in the US has fallen from more than 7 000 to fewer than 4 000 since 2000  the Financial Times reported last week  citing figures from Wilshire  the investment services company. A similar trend has unfolded in Europe and Britain.The so-called de-equitisation phenomenon has been compounded by companies using spare cash and borrowings to buy back chunks of their own shares. US investment banking giant JP Morgan estimates that about $1.2 trillion will be spent by companies globally buying back shares this year – broadly in line with each of the past three years.A host of Iseq 20 companies  from AIB to Origin  have participated in that game  too.Iseq All-Share breaches 10 000 for first time since 2007The Iseq All-Share index  comprised of all companies listed in Dublin  has breached the 10 000-point level this month for the first time since early 2007  when the then-high-flying banking stocks began to teeter at the tail end of the Celtic Tiger.The rebound lagged by more than a decade that of most other western markets from the great financial crisis. The FTSE 100 in London and Wall Street’s S&P 500 had each breached to their pre-crash levels by late 2013  while the pan-European Stoxx 600 index had rebounded by 2015.“While the composition of the Iseq is very different from 2007  it is a significant milestone for the index to have broken the 10 000 [level] after such a long period of time ” said Damian Roddy  head of capital markets at stockbrokers Davy.The Iseq All-Share has risen 16 per cent so far this year amid a wider advance by global markets  and hit a record high of almost 10 191 on Wednesday. It briefly rose above 10 000 during intraday trading on February 20th  2007  but hadn’t closed above that level again until Wednesday of last week.Still  the number of companies on the Iseq has fallen by more than 50 per cent over the period to just 26 today. Housebuilder Abbey  Aer Lingus and AGI Therapeutics  the first three in 2007 by alphabetical order  and final three  UTV  Veris and Waterford Wedgwood  are among those to have long exited the market.While the exits of former market heavyweights CRH and Flutter have hit the market values of the Iseq All-Share and Iseq 20 this year  they have not affected the actual calculations of the indices as adjustments are made to the so-called index devisors.,neutral,0.15,0.83,0.02,negative,0.01,0.26,0.72,True,English,"['Real’ Iseq 20 market value', 'double official list', 'former Elan chief executive Kelly Martin', 'US cardboard box-making peer WestRock', 'growing US fantasy sports website', 'New York-quoted drink cans group', 'Irish stock market trading turnover', 'Chadwicks owner Grafton Group', 'Paul Scott Malin Corporation', 'life sciences investment firm', 'Irish stock market exit', '20 largest Irish public companies', 'chief investment officer', 'US peer Perrigo', 'equity investment platform', 'two largest groups', 'Irish Times calculations', 'Noel O’Halloran', 'KBI Global Investors', 'private equity-fuelled buyouts', 'technology supplying conglomerate', 'Ardagh Metal Packaging', 'clinical trials group', 'Zurich-listed bakery group', 'past six months', 'largest Dublin-listed companies', 'high head-office costs', 'future growth opportunities', '21 times’ company earnings', 'total market capitalisation', 'MSCI World Index', 'recent heavyweight exits', '€220 billion combined value', 'growing attraction', 'Irish roots', 'stock exchanges', 'Irish listing', 'pharma group', 'US activities', 'first 15 months', 'past 10 years', 'Total Produce', 'recent decades', 'US listing', 'market value', 'billion) sale', 'great hopes', 'small portfolio', 'promising companies', 'various fields', 'strategic review', 'wider management', 'board overhaul', 'READ MORE', 'cancer treatments', 'remaining portfolio', 'smallest component', 'realisation” opportunities', 'bigger problems', 'Wall Street', 'European shares', 'European equities', 'North America', 'Smurfit Kappa', 'existential crisis', 'G1 world', 'capital markets', '70 per cent', 'Barry Glavin', '25 per cent', 'other markets', 'Dole plc', 'Dole Foods', 'significant functions', 'tax reasons', 'priority investments', 'remaining investments', 'cash returns', 'US-listed stocks', 'The Iseq', 'Real’ ISEQ', 'official Iseq', 'Flutter Entertainment', '$8.6 billion', 'Iseq 20', 'CRH', 'Illustration', 'premise', 'minimum', 'profits', 'IPO', 'ragbag', 'start-ups', 'contract', 'late', 'less', 'handful', 'shareholders', 'stakes', 'Immunocore', 'eczema-targeting', 'Kymab', 'days', 'February', 'listings', 'premium', 'average', 'UK', 'moves', 'fact', 'three-quarters', 'FanDuel', 'centre', 'gravity', 'Atlantic', 'summer', 'planned', 'merger', 'magnet', 'illusion', 'Amundi', 'scale', 'existi', 'assessment', 'number', 'London', 'wake', 'Brexit', 'sides', 'alternative', 'Ryanair', 'Icon', 'Nasdaq', 'DCC', 'Woodie', 'Fyffes', 'Aryzta', 'Switzerland', 'Luxembourg', 'headquarters', 'Republic']",2024-04-12,2024-04-13,irishtimes.com

At the beginning of the year  we saw growth  but needed to focus on profitability. Effective and swift measures were needed  and the organisation executed on a margin-improvement programme that reduced and improved our cost structure significantly while ensuring that we maintained the elements driving growth. That effort yielded results and in 2023 we reported 12% growth over 2022  and we increased our EBITDA margin to 15% compared to 1% for the previous year. In absolute numbers  that equals income of NOK 415 million and EBITDA of NOK 63 million. Net profit for the year was NOK 104 million. With the significant revenue growth  Omda exceeded the target of breaking the NOK 400 million mark in 2023  which gives us a solid platform to continue towards our long-term growth ambition. The fact that our recurring revenue reached NOK 321 million for the year  78% of total sales  is a testament to the value of our long-lasting customer realtionships and multi-year contracts. We expect further margin growth through 2024  and expect to deliver at our average target of 30% EBITDA on a run-rate basis during 2024. While the macro environment still is challenging  with sustained high interest rates and continued global uncertainty  Omda has made vital adjustments to operate in the 'new normal'. We are continuing our geographic diversification  and the share of revenue from the non-Nordic markets reached 17% when we exited 2023 compared to 1% in 2020 when the company was listed. We see this combination of geographic and domain diversification as a strategy to reduce risks  but also as an opportunity to capitalise on segmented growth opportunities. Towards the end of 2023  Omda successfully refinanced our existing bond loan of NOK 500 million  with an additional tap-issue of up to NOK 500 million. As we also have a cash reserve of NOK 120 million  as well as expected cash flow from operations  the Group is in a position to make both small and large acquisitions when the opportunity is right.

Key target indications for the autoimmune platform include graft-versus-host-disease (GvHD)  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  and now systemic sclerosis (SSc).Following the merger in October 2022  BioSenic combined the strategic positionings and strengths of Medsenic and Bone Therapeutics. The merger specifically enables Medsenic/Biosenic to develop an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/oral ATO (OATO).BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About the main Medsenic/BioSenic technology platformThe ATO platform provides derived active products with immunomodulatory properties and fundamental effects on the activated cells of the immune system. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. cGvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT).Medsenic has been successful in a phase 2 trial with its intravenous formulation  Arscimed®  which has orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA. The company is heading towards an international phase 3 confirmatory study  with its new  IP-protected  OATO formulation. Another selected target is moderate-to-severe forms of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae  and the gastrointestinal tract). Systemic sclerosis is now full part of the clinical pipeline of Medsenic/BioSenic. This serious chronic disease badly affects skin  lungs  or vascularization  and has no current effective treatment. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive  giving good grounds to launch a phase 2 clinical protocol  using new immunomodulatory formulations of APIs recognized to be active on the immune system.The company is currently focusing its present R&D and clinical activities on a selective  accelerated development of its autoimmune platform.Note: The allogeneic cell therapy platform-originating from the previous listed company Bone Therapeutics company  may be of renewed interest by using isolated and purified differentiated bone marrow Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) as a starting material for further isolation of passive or active biological subcellular elements. Indeed  these cells may provide new subcellular vesicles potentially able to deliver a unique and proprietary approach to organ repair. BioSenic is now involved in determining new patentable approaches in this complex area of cell therapy.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAFrançois Rieger  PhD  CEOTel: +33 (0)671 73 31 59investorrelations@biosenic.comInternational Media Enquiries:IB CommunicationsMichelle BoxallTel: +44 (0)20 8943 4685michelle@ibcomms.agencyFrench Investor Enquiries:Seitosei ActifinGhislaine GasparettoTel: +33 (0)1 56 88 11 22ghislaine.gasparetto@seitosei-actifin.comMichael Scholzemichael.scholze@seitosei-actifin.comCertain statements  beliefs and opinions in this press release are forward-looking  which reflect the company or  as appropriate  the company directors’ current expectations and projections about future events.

This will allow quick identification of new safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions.Brussels (Belgium)  12 April 2024 - UCB  a global biopharmaceutical company  today announced key findings from the first retrospective patient cohort study in Denmark to observe the characteristics of patients selected for romosozumab treatment in routine clinical practice. The data were presented as a poster presentation at the World Congress on Osteoporosis  Osteoarthritis and Musculoskeletal Diseases (WCO-IOF-ESCEO) 2024 in London  UK  11-14 April.The observational  retrospective cohort study included female patients aged 50 years or older receiving osteoporosis medication during September 2020 to October 2023  identified by prescription and hospital registry data. Overall  149 395 patients were included in the analysis; of these  622 with a fracture in the three years before the date of cohort entry were treated with romsozumab.1The study observed that  of patients who had sustained a fracture at any skeletal site in the three years before the date of cohort entry and were treated with romosozumab  fracture history included hip fractures (n=79/N=622 (12.7%)) and spine fractures (n=64/N=622 (10.3%))  in addition to non-hip  non-spine (n=303/N=622 (48.7%)) and osteoporosis with pathological fracture not related to malignancy or other bone diseases (n=335/N=622 (53.9%)). The study also highlighted that of the 622 female patients treated with romosozumab  44.5% (n=277) had not received any prior treatment for osteoporosis.1""It is vital that patients with osteoporosis at high risk of fracture receive timely and appropriate care from the offset to reduce the risk of future fractures and improve outcomes "" said lead study investigator Prof Bente Langdahl (Clinical Professor  Aarhus University Hospital  Denmark). ""By offering critical insights into the treatment patterns of romosozumab and other osteoporosis treatments in a real-world setting  this study allows us to further investigate prescription patterns and the profile of patients who may benefit the most from the use of romosozumab as a first-line treatment. This knowledge will help us improve treatment of patients with severe osteoporosis at high risk of fracture.""The global impact of osteoporosis is profound  with one in three women over the age of 50 likely to experience a fracture caused by osteoporosis.2 In Europe alone  the economic cost is estimated at 37.5 billion EUR - a number predicted to increase by 27% by 2030.3 Despite this  data in Europe has demonstrated that up to 85% of women are not treated for underlying osteoporosis following a fragility fracture.4""This cohort patient study provides an invaluable blueprint to inform future treatment decision-making and support optimal use of romosozumab in clinical practice  both in Denmark and across Europe "" said Emmanuel Caeymaex  Executive Vice President  Immunology and U.S. Solutions at UCB. ""The study findings enable us to understand the use of romosozumab as a treatment option in the real world and demonstrate its potential in closing the treatment gap for patients at high risk of fracture.""Romosozumab was approved in the European Union in December 2019 for the treatment of severe osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at high risk of fracture.5WCO - World Congress on Osteoporosis  Osteoarthritis and Musculoskeletal Diseases; IOF - International Osteoporosis Foundation  ESCEO - European Society for Clinical and Economic Aspects of Osteoporosis and Osteoarthritis.For further information  contact UCB:Investor RelationsAntje WitteT +32 2 559 9414Antje.witte@ucb.comGlobal CommunicationsAdriaan SnauwaertT+32 497 70 23 46Adriaan.snauwaert@ucb.comDate of preparation: April 2024 | GL-RM-2400001© UCB Biopharma SRL  2024. All rights reserved.About the European retrospective cohort studyA retrospective cohort study was conducted using data recorded from Danish administrative registries. The study population comprised female patients aged ≥50 receiving osteoporosis medication during the period from September 2020 to October 2023. The objective of the study is to observe patterns and influencing factors of romosozumab use in routine clinical practice in Denmark. The study included three cohorts: i) patients with severe osteoporosis treated with romosozumab  ii) patients with severe osteoporosis not treated with romosozumab  and iii) patients who did not have severe osteoporosis and were not treated with romosozumab. Patients were considered as having severe osteoporosis if they had sustained a fracture at any skeletal site in the three years before the index date (BMD data were not available in the dataset). The characteristics investigated in the three cohorts included: age  index treatment  comorbidities  osteoporosis treatment history  dispensing of drugs that increase risk of falling and fracture  fracture history  and use of glucocorticoids.About EVENITY® (romosozumab)Romosozumab is a bone-forming monoclonal antibody. It is designed to work by inhibiting the activity of sclerostin  which simultaneously results in increased bone formation and to a lesser extent decreased bone resorption. The romosozumab development program includes 19 clinical studies that enrolled approximately 14 000 patients. EVENITY has been studied for its potential to reduce the risk of fractures in an extensive global phase 3 program that included two large fracture trials comparing romosozumab to either placebo or active comparator in over 11 000 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Amgen and UCB are co-developing romosozumab.Important Safety Information about EVENITY® (romosozumab) in the EU/EEAIn the EU  romosozumab is indicated for treatment of severe osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at high risk of fracture.Contraindications: Romosozumab is contraindicated in patients who are allergic to romosozumab or any of the excipients  who have low levels of calcium in the blood (hypocalcaemia)  or who have a history of myocardial infarction (heart attack) or stroke. Myocardial infarction or stroke: Heart attack and stroke have been reported in patients receiving romosozumab in randomised controlled trials (uncommon). Treatment with romosozumab should not be initiated in patients with a history of heart attack or stroke. When determining whether to use romosozumab for an individual patient  the presence of risk factors for cardiovascular problems  including established cardiovascular disease  high blood pressure  high blood fat levels  diabetes  smoking or kidney problems  should be evaluated. romosozumab should only be used if the prescriber and patient agree that the benefit outweighs the risk. If a patient experiences a myocardial infarction or stroke during therapy  treatment with romosozumab should be discontinued. Hypocalcaemia: Transient hypocalcaemia has been observed in patients receiving romosozumab. Hypocalcaemia should be corrected prior to initiating therapy with romosozumab and patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of hypocalcaemia. If any patient presents with suspected symptoms of hypocalcaemia during treatment  calcium levels should be measured. Patients should be adequately supplemented with calcium and vitamin D. Patients with severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] 15 to 29ml/min/1.73m2) or receiving dialysis are at greater risk of developing hypocalcaemia and the safety data for these patients are limited. Calcium levels should be monitored in these patients. Hypersensitivity: Clinically significant hypersensitivity reactions  including angioedema  erythema multiforme  and urticaria occurred in the romosozumab group in clinical trials. If an anaphylactic or other clinically significant allergic reaction occurs  appropriate therapy should be initiated and use of romosozumab should be discontinued. Osteonecrosis of the Jaw: Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported rarely in patients receiving romosozumab. The following risk factors should be considered when evaluating a patient's risk of developing ONJ: (1) potency of the medicinal product that inhibits bone resorption (the risk increases with the antiresorptive potency of the compound)  and cumulative dose of bone resorption therapy  (2) cancer  co-morbid conditions (e.g. anaemia  coagulopathies  infection)  smoking  (3) concomitant therapies: corticosteroids  chemotherapy  angiogenesis inhibitors  radiotherapy to head and neck  (4) poor oral hygiene  periodontal disease  poorly fitting dentures  history of dental disease  invasive dental procedures e.g. tooth extractions. All patients should be encouraged to maintain good oral hygiene and receive routine dental check-ups. Dentures should fit correctly. Patients under dental treatment  or who will undergo dental surgery (e.g. tooth extractions) whilst being treated with romosozumab should inform their doctor about their dental treatment and inform their dentist that they are receiving romosozumab. Patients should immediately report any oral symptoms such as dental mobility  pain or swelling or non-healing of sores or pus discharge during treatment with romosozumab. Patients who are suspected of having or who develop ONJ while receiving romosozumab should receive care by a dentist or an oral surgeon with expertise in ONJ. Discontinuation of romosozumab therapy should be considered until the condition resolves and contributing risk factors are mitigated where possible. Atypical Femoral Fractures: Atypical low-energy or low trauma fracture of the femoral shaft  which can occur spontaneously  has been reported rarely in patients receiving romosozumab. Any patient who presents with new or unusual thigh  hip  or groin pain should be suspected of having an atypical fracture and should be evaluated to rule out an incomplete femur fracture. Patient presenting with an atypical femur fracture should also be assessed for symptoms and signs of fracture in the contralateral limb. Interruption of romosozumab therapy should be considered  based on an individual benefit-risk assessment. Adverse Reactions: The most common adverse reactions were nasopharyngitis (13.6%) and arthralgia (12.4%). Common adverse reactions included hypersensitivity  sinusitis  rash  dermatitis  headache  neck pain  muscle spasms and injection site reactions (most frequent injection site reactions were pain and erythema). Uncommon adverse reactions were urticaria  hypocalcaemia  stroke  myocardial infarction and cataract. Finally  rare side effects were serious allergic reactions which caused swelling of the face  throat  hands  feet  ankles or lower legs (angioedema) and acute skin eruption (erythema multiforme).Refer to the European Summary of Product Characteristics for other adverse reactions and full prescribing information.

In upside scenarios of the CFFO compared to the amount foreseen in the Plan  up to 60% of incremental cashflows will be applied to buyback.In line with the Plan  Eni therefore intends to launch the new buyback Program in 2024 for an amount of €1.1 billion. This amount may be increased up to a total maximum of €3.5 billion  in case of upside scenarios of the CFFO as described above.The maximum amount of shares that can be purchased under the program is no. 328 millions of shares (approximately 10% of Eni's share capital).Authorization for the purchase of treasury shares under the new buyback Program is requested for the following purposes:- up to no. 321.6 millions of shares  to remunerate shareholders;- up to no. 6.4 millions of shares  to be used for the implementation of the PAD  also submitted for approval by the same Shareholders' Meeting.Purchases made under the new buyback Program will be made at a price identified in compliance with regulatory requirements and accepted market practices in force from time to time. This price may not deviate downward or upward by more than 10% from the official price recorded by Eni S.p.A. stock in the session of the Euronext Milan market  organized and managed by Borsa Italiana S.p.A.  on the day preceding each individual transaction.Purchases may be made:- on regulated markets in accordance with operating procedures established in the regulations for the organization and management of those markets;- in the way established by the market practices permitted by Consob pursuant to Article 13 of Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014 (if applicable);- under the conditions set forth in Article 5 of Regulation (EU) No. 596/2014.The Board of Directors has also resolved to submit a proposal to the Shareholders' Meeting  called in extraordinary session  to cancel the treasury shares to be purchased under the new buyback Program for the purpose of remunerating shareholders (maximum no. 321.6 millions of treasury shares). This cancellation will be carried out by the Board of Directors without reducing the share capital  in view of the absence of the par value of Eni's shares  by July 2025  in one or more acts  even before the maximum number of shares authorized by the Shareholders' Meeting has been purchased.For shares purchased for the implementation of the PAD  the Shareholders' Meeting is called upon to authorize the Board of Directors to dispose such shares in accordance with methods and timing defined by the PAD and  for any potential surplus  in the way deemed most appropriate and in accordance with the interest of the Company and  in any case  in compliance with applicable regulations and any applicable market practices.The documentation relating to the Shareholders' Meeting will be made available to the public within the terms and in the way provided for by current regulations  including through publication on the Company's website.As of today's date  Eni holds no. 90 221 072 treasury shares equal to approximately 2.7% of the share capital.

In particular  as well as the buyback programme pursuant to item 6 on the agenda of this Shareholders' Meeting  the Shareholders Remuneration Policy envisages  for 2024  a dividend of € 1 per share  to be paid in four tranches.This dividend is consistent with the 2024-2027 Plan  which provides for a significant cash generation capacity and is also sustainable in economic-financial and capital terms. In addition  with specific reference to Eni S.p.A  the capital and financial sustainability is further reflected in its high capitalisation and financial strength resulting  among other things  from the financial statements for the year ended on 31 December 2023.The dividend for financial year 2024 of € 1 per share corresponds to a total distribution of approx. € 3.2 billion considering the shares outstanding at 31 December 2023  the payment of which is provided for according to the following schedule:· September 2024: € 0.25 per share;· November 2024: € 0.25 per share;· March 2025: € 0.25 per share;· May 2025: € 0.25 per share.In line with what was done for the distribution of the dividend of financial year 2023  in order to ensure the payment of the dividend envisaged for 2024  before the approval of the related financial statements  the Board of Directors proposes that the Shareholders' Meeting resolve to distribute Eni S.p.A.'s available reserves  including the portion of the revaluation reserve ex Lege 342/2000  released from legal restrictions in 2023 and not used for the purposes of dividend distribution in 2023. In particular  the Shareholders' Meeting of 10 May 2023 had resolved to reduce the ""Revaluation reserve pursuant to Law 342/2000"" by € 2 300 million to allow for its use  if applicable  for the purposes of distribution for and in place of the payment of the dividend relating to financial year 2023. The aforesaid reserve will be used for the distribution of the fourth tranche of the 2023 dividend (for approx. € 735 million) and  therefore  will be available for the residual amount (equal to approx. € 1 565 million) for the purposes of payment for and in place of the 2024 dividend.In this regard  the Board of Directors proposes that the Shareholders' Meeting resolve to use Eni S.p.A.'s available reserves for and in place of the payment of the dividend relating to financial year 2024  including  if appropriate and in the interest of the shareholders  any use of the portion of the revaluation reserve ex Lege 342/2000 already released from legal restrictions and not yet used.The amount of the distribution provided for in the 2024 Remuneration Policy of approx. € 3.2 billion is amply covered by the amount of Eni S.p.A.'s available reserves. In this regard  it should be noted that as at 31 December 2023  Eni S.p.A.'s available reserves amount to a total of approx. € 37 billion  in addition to the profit for financial year 2023 (approx. € 3.3 billion) to be carried forward (see item 2 of this agenda above).13The Shareholders' Meeting is also requested to delegate to the Board of Directors the execution of the aforementioned resolution and the ascertainment that there are no obstacles to the distribution of the above dividend in terms of the capital and financial sustainability of the use of reserves for that distribution  having regard to the overall context in which the Company operates  as well as the performance and financial situation of the Company and the Eni Group emerging from the accounting data and forecasts for the whole year referable to: (i) June 30  2024  for the distribution of September 2024; (ii) September 30  2024  for the distribution of November 2024; (iii) the 2024 annual preliminary results  for the distribution of March 2025 and (iv) 2024 draft annual financial statements  for the distribution planned in May 2025.In regards of the above  the adoption of the following resolution is proposed:""Dear Shareholders  in accordance with the Shareholders Remuneration Policy approved by the Board of Directors of Eni S.p.A. on 13 March 2024  which sets a dividend of € 1 per share for 2024 and distribution in four tranches of equal amount (€ 0.25 per share)  in the months of: (i) September 2024; (ii) November 2024; (iii) March 2025  and (iv) May 2025  we ask that you approve the following resolution:1) to approve the distribution  for and in place of the payment of the dividend relating to financial year 2024  of a sum of € 1 (one) per share  in tranches of an equal amount (€ 0.25 per share) in the months of (i) September 2024; (ii) November 2024; (iii) March 2025  and (iv) May 2025;2) to approve the use of available reserves for and in place of the payment of the dividend relating to financial year 2024  making use  if appropriate and in the interest of the Shareholders  of the residual amount of the revaluation reserve ex Lege 342/2000  use of which was subject to resolution by the Shareholders' Meeting of 10 May 2023;3) to delegate the Board of Directors to implement the above resolutions  verifying from time to time the existence of the legal conditions for the purposes of distributing the reserve.""14ITEM 8CANCELLATION OF ANY TREASURY SHARES TO BE PURCHASED UNDER THE TERMS OF THE AUTHORISATION PURSUANT TO ITEM 6 ON THE AGENDA OF THE ORDINARY PART  WITHOUT REDUCTION OF THE SHARE CAPITAL  AND CONSEQUENT AMENDMENTS TO ARTICLE 5 OF THE BY-LAWS; RELATED AND CONSEQUENT RESOLUTIONS(EXTRAORDINARY PART)Dear Shareholders with reference to the purchase of Eni's ordinary shares submitted for your authorisation pursuant to item 6 on the agenda of the present Shareholders' Meeting in ordinary session  the Board of Directors has called you to an extraordinary session to resolve on the proposal to cancel any treasury shares that will be purchased on the basis of the aforesaid authorisation for the purpose of paying to its Shareholders further remuneration for the distribution of dividends  for a maximum number of 321 600 000 treasury shares  representing approximately 9.8% of the Company's share capital.The cancellation proposal is in line with the purposes of the purchase  as already stated in the Report containing an explanation of the aforementioned authorisation pursuant to item 6 on the agenda of the present Shareholders' Meeting in ordinary session.The cancellation - the execution of which is entrusted to the Board of Directors  with the option of delegation to the Chief Executive Officer and sub-delegation by the same - may be made also through several actions  even before the purchase of the maximum number of shares authorised today by the Shareholders' Meeting in ordinary session under the terms of item 6 on the agenda and by and no later than July 2025.The cancellation of treasury shares will not have effect on the Company's economic performance and will not modify the value of Shareholders' equity.The cancellation will be followed by the amendment of Art. 5.1 of the By-laws in the part in which they indicate the number of shares into which the share capital is divided.It is proposed  therefore  to add a last paragraph to the current Art. 5 of the By-laws as shown in the table presented below.

Currently the voting rights attaching to Eni's treasury shares are suspended in accordance with art. 2357-ter  paragraph 2  of the Italian Civil Code; once granted to the Beneficiaries  these Eni Shares will give voting rights to their owners. The grant of Eni Shares to Beneficiaries can give rise to a maximum dilution of voting rights of 0.3%.page 8 of 94.14 Any limits envisaged for the exercise of voting rights and the attribution of economic rightsEni Shares granted will enjoy ordinary rights  there being no limits envisaged on the exercising of the inherent voting rights or economic rights  except as provided in paragraph 4.6.4.15 If shares are not traded on regulated markets  all information that will help fully assess the value that can be assigned to themNot applicable.4.16- 4.22 Not applicable.4.23 Criteria for the adjustments necessary following extraordinary capital operations and other operations entailing the change in the number of underlying instruments (capital increases  extraordinary dividends  groupings and splitting of the underlying shares  mergers and spinoffs  conversions into other share categories  etc.)Eni's Board of Directors  where the conditions exist  may adapt the terms and conditions of the Plan as a result of the following operations:a) grouping or splitting of shares representing Eni's capital stock;b) increase of Eni's capital stock free of charge;c) increase of Eni's capital stock against payment  also through the issue of shares with warrants attached  bonds convertible into Eni shares and bonds with warrants to subscribe Eni shares; the sale of treasury shares that are not at the service of Share Incentive Plans is equated with a capital stock increase;d) reduction of Eni's capital stock;e) distribution of extraordinary dividends with withdrawals from Eni reserves;f) merger  if this entails changes to Eni's capital stock;g) spin-off of Eni;h) granting of assets in the Eni portfolio to shareholders;i) public purchase offers or public purchase and exchange offers involving Eni shares.4.24 Share Issuers will add the attached table 1 to the Informative DocumentThe table containing information on the Plan will be provided  in accordance with Art. 84-bis of the Issuers' Regulation  at the time the Shares are granted during the implementation of the Plan to be approved by Eni's Board of Directors.

This will allow quick identification of new safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions.Rystiggo is indicated as an add-on to standard therapy for the treatment of generalised myasthenia gravis (gMG) in adult patients who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) or anti-muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) antibody positive.1The most commonly reported adverse reactions were headache (48.4 %)  diarrhea (25.0 %) and pyrexia (12.5 %). The adverse reactions from the placebo-controlled study in gMG are as follow: Very common ( ‰¥ 1/10) headache  diarrhea and pyrexia; Common ( ‰¥ 1/100 to < 1/10) rash  angioedema  arthralgia and injection site reactions. Headache was the most common reaction reported in 31 (48.4 %) and 13 (19.4 %) of the patients treated with rozanolixizumab and placebo  respectively. All headaches  except 1 (1.6 %) severe headache  were either mild (28.1 % [n=18]) or moderate (18.8 % [n=12]) and there was no increase in incidences of headache with repeated cyclic treatment.Rozanolixizumab is contra-indicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.Treatment with rozanolixizumab in patients with impending or manifest myasthenic crisis has not been studied. The sequence of therapy initiation between established therapies for MG crisis and rozanolixizumab  and their potential interactions  should be considered.Aseptic meningitis (drug induced aseptic meningitis) has been reported following rozanolixizumab treatment at a higher dose with subsequent recovery without sequelae after discontinuation. If symptoms consistent with aseptic meningitis occur  diagnostic workup and treatment should be initiated as per standard of care.Due to its mechanism of action  the use of rozanolixizumab may increase the patient's susceptibility to infections. Treatment with rozanolixizumab should not be initiated in patients with a clinically important active infection until the infection is resolved or is adequately treated. During treatment with rozanolixizumab  clinical signs and symptoms of infections should be monitored. If a clinically important active infection occurs  withholding rozanolixizumab until the infection has resolved should be considered.Hypersensitivity reactions including mild to moderate rash or angioedema were observed in patients treated with rozanolixizumab. Patients should be monitored during treatment with rozanolixizumab and for 15 minutes after the administration is complete for clinical signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions. If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs during administration  rozanolixizumab infusion should be discontinued and appropriate measures should be initiated if needed. Once resolved  administration may be resumedImmunization with vaccines during rozanolixizumab therapy has not been studied. The safety of immunization with live or live-attenuated vaccines and the response to immunization with vaccines are unknown. All vaccines should be administered according to immunization guidelines and at least 4 weeks before initiation of treatment. For patients that are on treatment  vaccination with live or live attenuated vaccines is not recommended. For all other vaccines  they should take place at least 2 weeks after the last infusion of a treatment cycle and 4 weeks before initiating the next cycle.Refer to the European Summary of Product Characteristics for other adverse reactions and full prescribing information. https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/product-information/rystiggo-epar-product-information_en.pdf.Important Safety Information about ZILBRYSQ ® –¼ (zilucoplan) in the EU 2–¼This medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions.Zilbrysq is indicated as an add-on to standard therapy for the treatment of generalised myasthenia gravis (gMG) in adult patients who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive.2The most frequently reported adverse reactions were injection site reactions (injection site bruising (13.9%) and injection site pain (7.0%) and upper respiratory tract infections (nasopharyngitis (5.2%)  upper respiratory tract infection (3.5%) and sinusitis (3.5%). The adverse reactions from the pooled placebo controlled (n=115) and open-label extension (n=213) studies in gMG are as follows: Very common adverse reactions: ( ‰¥ 1/10): Upper respiratory tract infections and Injection site reactions; Common adverse reactions ( ‰¥ 1/100 to < 1/10) Diarrhea  Lipase increased  Amylase increased and Morphea; Uncommon adverse reaction ( ‰¥ 1/1000 to < 1/100) blood eosinophils increased. Zilucoplan is contra-indicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients  in patients who are not currently vaccinated against Neisseria meningitidis and in patients with unresolved Neisseria meningitidis infection. Due to its mechanism of action  the use of zilucoplan may increase the patient's susceptibility to infections with Neisseria meningitidis. As a precautionary measure  all patients must be vaccinated against meningococcal infections  at least 2 weeks prior to the start of treatment. If treatment needs to start less than 2 weeks after vaccination against meningococcal infections  the patient must receive appropriate prophylactic antibiotic treatment until 2 weeks after the first vaccination dose. Meningococcal vaccines reduce but do not completely eliminate the risk of meningococcal infections. Vaccines against serogroups A  C  Y  W  and where available  serogroup B  are recommended for preventing the commonly pathogenic meningococcal serogroups. Vaccination and prophylactic antibiotic treatment should occur according to most current relevant guidelines. During treatment  patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of meningococcal infection and evaluated immediately if infection is suspected. In case of a suspected meningococcal infection  appropriate measures such as treatment with antibiotics and discontinuation of treatment  should be taken until the meningococcal infection can be ruled out. Patients should be instructed to seek immediate medical advice if signs or symptoms of meningococcal infections occur. Prescribers should be familiar with the educational materials for the management of meningococcal infections and provide a patient alert card and patient/carer guide to patients treated with zilucoplan. In addition to Neisseria meningitidis  patients treated with zilucoplan may also be susceptible to infections with other Neisseria species  such as gonococcal infections. Patients should be informed on the importance of gonorrhea prevention and treatment. Prior to initiating zilucoplan therapy  it is recommended that patients initiate immunizations according to current immunization guidelines.

EC Date of approval 01 Dec 2023 .Important Safety Information about FINTEPLA ® –¼ (fenfluramine) in the EU 3–¼This medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions.Indications: Treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome as an add-on therapy to other anti-epileptic medicines for patients 2 years of age and older.Dosage and Administration: Please refer to SmPC for full information. Should be initiated and supervised by physicians with experience in the treatment of epilepsy. Fintepla is prescribed and dispensed according to the Fintepla controlled access programme. Dravet syndrome: Patients who are not taking stiripentol: Starting dose is 0.1 mg/kg twice daily (0.2 mg/kg/day). After 7 days  if tolerated  can increase dose to 0.2 mg/kg twice daily (0.4 mg/kg/day). After an additional 7 days  if tolerated and further seizure reduction required  can increase dose to a maximum of 0.35 mg/kg twice daily (0.7 mg/kg/day)  which is the recommended maintenance dose. Patients requiring more rapid titration may increase the dose every 4 days. Do not exceed maximum daily dose of 26 mg (13 mg twice daily). Patients who are taking stiripentol: Starting dose is 0.1 mg/kg twice daily (0.2 mg/kg/day). After 7 days  if tolerated  can increase dose to 0.2 mg/kg twice daily (0.4 mg/kg/day)  which is the recommended maintenance dose. Patients requiring more rapid titration may increase the dose every 4 days. Do not exceed a total dose of 17 mg (8.6 mg twice daily). Lennox-Gastaut syndrome: Starting dose is 0.1 mg/kg twice daily (0.2 mg/kg/day). After 7 days  the dose should be increased to 0.2 mg/kg twice daily (0.4 mg/kg/day)  if tolerated. After an additional 7 days  if tolerated  dose should be increased to 0.35 mg/kg twice daily (0.7 mg/kg/day)  which is the recommended maintenance dose. Do not exceed maximum daily dose of 26 mg (13 mg twice daily). Discontinuation: When discontinuing treatment  decrease the dose gradually. As with all anti-epileptic medicines  avoid abrupt discontinuation when possible to minimize the risk of increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus. A final echocardiogram should be conducted 3-6 months after the last dose of treatment with fenfluramine. Renal impairment: Generally  no dose adjustment is recommended when administered to patients with mild to severe renal impairment  however  a slower titration may be considered. If adverse reactions are reported  a dose reduction may be needed. Has not been studied in patients with end-stage renal disease. Not known if fenfluramine or its active metabolite  norfenfluramine  is dialyzable. Hepatic impairment: Hepatic impairment: Generally  no dose adjustment is recommended when Fintepla is administered without concomitant stiripentol to patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A and B). In patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) not receiving concomitant stiripentol  the maximum dosage is 0.2mg/kg twice daily  and the maximal total daily dose is 17 mg. There are limited clinical data on the use of Fintepla with stiripentol in patients with mild impaired hepatic function. A slower titration may be considered in patients with hepatic impairment and a dose reduction may be needed if adverse reactions are reported. No clinical data is available on the use of Fintepla with stiripentol in moderate and severe hepatic impairment  therefore not recommended for use. Elderly: No data available. Pediatric population: Safety and efficacy in children below 2 years of age not yet established. No data available. Contraindications: Hypersensitivity to active substance or any excipients. Aortic or mitral valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension. Within 14 days of the administration of monoamine oxidase inhibitors due to an increased risk of serotonin syndrome.Warnings and Precautions: Aortic or mitral valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension: Prior to starting treatment  patients must undergo an echocardiogram to establish a baseline and exclude any pre-existing valvular heart disease or pulmonary hypertension. Conduct echocardiogram monitoring every 6 months for the first 2 years and annually thereafter. If an echocardiogram indicates pathological valvular changes  consider follow-up earlier to evaluate whether the abnormality is persistent. If pathological abnormalities seen on echocardiogram  evaluate the benefit versus risk of continuing fenfluramine treatment with the prescriber  caregiver and cardiologist. Once treatment is discontinued for any reasons  a final echocardiogram should be conducted 3-6 months after the last dose of treatment with fenfluramine. If echocardiogram findings suggestive of pulmonary arterial hypertension  perform a repeat echocardiogram as soon as possible and within 3 months to confirm these findings. If echocardiogram finding is confirmed suggestive of an increased probability of pulmonary arterial hypertension defined as intermediate probability  conduct a benefit-risk evaluation of continuation of Fintepla by the prescriber  carer and cardiologist. If echocardiogram suggests a high probability  it is recommended fenfluramine treatment should be stopped. Decreased appetite and weight loss: Fenfluramine can cause decreased appetite and weight loss - an additive effect can occur in combination with other anti-epileptic medicines such as stiripentol. Monitor the patient's weight. Undertake risk-benefit evaluation before starting treatment if history of anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa. Fintepla controlled access programme: A controlled access programme has been created to 1) prevent off-label use in weight management in obese patients and 2) confirm that prescribing physicians have been informed of the need for periodic cardiac monitoring in patients taking Fintepla. Somnolence: Fenfluramine can cause somnolence which could be potentiated by other central nervous system depressants. Suicidal behaviour and ideation: Suicidal behaviour and ideation have been reported in patients treated with anti-epileptic medicines in several indications. Advise patients and caregivers to seek medical advice should any signs of suicidal behaviour and ideation emerge. Serotonin syndrome: Serotonin syndrome  a potentially life-threatening condition  may occur with fenfluramine treatment  particularly with concomitant use of other serotonergic agents; with agents that impair metabolism of serotonin such as MAOIs; or with antipsychotics that may affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems. Carefully observe the patient  particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases. Increased seizure frequency: A clinically relevant increase in seizure frequency may occur during treatment  which may require adjustment in the dose of fenfluramine and/or concomitant anti-epileptic medicines  or discontinuation of fenfluramine  should the benefit-risk be negative. Cyproheptadine: Cyproheptadine is a potent serotonin receptor antagonist and may therefore decrease the efficacy of fenfluramine. If cyproheptadine is added to treatment with fenfluramine  monitor patient for worsening of seizures. If fenfluramine treatment is initiated in a patient taking cyproheptadine  fenfluramine's efficacy may be reduced. Glaucoma: Fenfluramine can cause mydriasis and can precipitate angle closure glaucoma. Discontinue therapy in patients with acute decreases in visual acuity. Consider discontinuation if ocular pain of unknown origin. Effect of CYP1A2 or CYP2B6 inducers: Co-administration with strong CYP1A2 inducers or CYP2B6 inducers will decrease fenfluramine plasma concentrations  which may lower the efficacy of fenfluramine. If co-administration is considered necessary  the patient should be monitored for reduced efficacy and a dose increase of fenfluramine could be considered provided that it does not exceed twice the maximum daily dose (52 mg/day). If a strong CYP1A2 or CYP2B6 inducer is discontinued during maintenance treatment with fenfluramine  consider gradual reduction of the fenfluramine dosage to the dose administered prior to initiating the inducer. Effect of CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitors: Initiation of concomitant treatment with a strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitor may result in higher exposure and  therefore  adverse events should be monitored  and a dose reduction may be needed in some patients. Excipients: Contains sodium ethyl para-hydroxybenzoate (E 215) and sodium methyl para-hydroxybenzoate (E 219) - may cause allergic reactions (possibly delayed). It also contains sulfur dioxide (E 220) which may rarely cause severe hypersensitivity reactions and bronchospasm. Patients with rare glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. The product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per the maximum daily dose of 12 mL; essentially 'sodium-free'. Contains glucose - may be harmful to teeth. Interactions: Pharmacodynamic interactions with other CNS depressants increase the risk of aggravated central nervous system depression. An increase in dose may be necessary when coadministered with rifampicin or a strong CYP1A2 or CYP2B6 inducer. In in vitro studies co-administration with a strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitor may result in higher exposure (see section 4.4 of the SmPC). Co-administration with CYP2D6 substrates or MATE1 substrates may increase their plasma concentrations. Co-administration with CYP2B6 or CYP3A4 substrates may decrease their plasma concentrations. Pregnancy and lactation: Limited data in pregnant women. As a precaution  avoid use of Fintepla in pregnancy. It is unknown whether fenfluramine/metabolites are excreted in human milk. Animal data have shown excretion of fenfluramine/metabolites in milk. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from Fintepla taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. Drive and use machines.: Fintepla has moderate influence on the ability to drive/ use machines as it may cause somnolence and fatigue. Advise patients not to drive or operate machinery until they have sufficient experience to gauge whether it adversely affects their abilities.Adverse effects: Dravet syndrome: Very common ( ‰¥1/10): Upper respiratory tract infection  decreased appetite  somnolence  diarrhoea  pyrexia  fatigue  blood glucose decreased  echocardiogram abnormal (Consisted of trace and mild mitral regurgitation  and trace aortic regurgitation  which are considered physiologic). Common ( ‰¥1/100 to <1/10): Bronchitis  abnormal behaviour  aggression  agitation  insomnia  mood swings  ataxia  hypotonia  lethargy  seizure  status epilepticus  tremor  constipation  salivary hypersecretion  weight decreased and blood prolactin increased. Not known (cannot be estimated from the available data): Pulmonary arterial hypertension. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome: Very common ( ‰¥1/10): Upper respiratory tract infection  decreased appetite  somnolence  diarrhoea  vomiting  fatigue. Common ( ‰¥1/100 to <1/10): Bronchitis  influenza  pneumonia  aggression  seizure  status epilepticus  lethargy  tremor  constipation  salivary hypersecretion  blood prolactin increased  weight decreased  fall. Refer to SmPC for other adverse reactions.Refer to the European Summary of Product Characteristics for other adverse reactions and full prescribing information.https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/product-information/fintepla-epar-product-information_en.pdfImportant Safety Information about BRIVIACT ® (brivaracetam) in the EU 4Therapeutic indications: BRIVIACT is indicated as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalisation in adults  adolescents and children from 2 years of age with epilepsy.Posology and method of administration: The physician should prescribe the most appropriate formulation and strength according to weight and dose. It is recommended to parent and care giver to administer BRIVIACT oral solution with the measuring device (10 ml or 5 ml oral dosing syringe) provided in the carton box. BRIVIACT solution for injection/infusion is an alternative route of administration for patients when oral administration is temporarily not feasible. There is no experience with twice daily intravenous administration of brivaracetam for a period longer than 4 days. Adults: The recommended starting dose is 50 or 100 mg/day based on physician's assessment of required for seizure reduction versus potential side effects. Brivaracetam can be taken with or without food. Based on individual patient response and tolerability  the dose may be adjusted in the effective dose range of 50 mg/day to 200 mg/day. Children and adolescents weighing 50 kg or more: The recommended starting dose is 50 mg/day. Brivaracetam may also be initiated at 100 mg/day based on physician's assessment of need for seizure control. The recommended maintenance dose is 100 mg/day. Based on individual patient response  the dose may be adjusted in the effective dose range of 50 mg/day to 200 mg/day. Children and adolescents weighing from 20 kg to less than 50 kg: The recommended starting dose is 1 mg/kg/day. Brivaracetam may also be initiated at doses up to 2 mg/kg/day based on physician's assessment of need for seizure control. The recommended maintenance dose is 2 mg/kg/day. Based on individual patient response  the dose may be adjusted in the effective dose range of 1 mg/kg/day to 4 mg/kg/day. Children weighing from 10 kg to less than 20 kg: The recommended starting dose is 1 mg/kg/day. Brivaracetam may also be initiated at doses up to 2.5 mg/kg/day based on physician's assessment of need for seizure control. The recommended maintenance dose is 2.5 mg/kg/day. Based on individual patient response  the dose may be adjusted in the effective dose range of 1 mg/kg/day to 5 mg/kg/day. For adults  adolescents and children from 2 years of age  the dose should be administered in two equally divided doses  approximately 12 hours apart.If patients miss one dose or more  it is recommended that they take a single dose as soon as they remember and take the following dose at the usual morning or evening time. Brivaracetam oral solution can be diluted in water or juice shortly before swallowing; a nasogastric tube or a gastrostomy tube may also be used. Brivaracetam may be initiated with either intravenous or oral administration. When converting from oral to intravenous administration or vice versa  the total daily dose and frequency of administration should be maintained. Brivaracetam may be administered as an intravenous bolus without dilution or diluted in a compatible diluent and administered as a 15-minute intravenous infusion. This medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal products. Brivaracetam bolus injection or intravenous infusion has not been studied in acute conditions  e.g. status epilepticus  and is therefore not recommended for such conditions For patients from 16 years of age  if brivaracetam has to be discontinued  it is recommended that the dose is reduced gradually by 50 mg/day on a weekly basis. For patients below the age of 16 years  if brivaracetam has to be discontinued  it is recommended that the dose is reduced by a maximum of half the dose every week until a dose of 1 mg/kg/day (for patients with a body weight less than 50 kg) or 50 mg/day (for patients with body weight of 50 kg or more) is reached. After 1 week of treatment at 50 mg/day  a final week of treatment at 20 mg/day is recommended. No dose adjustment is needed for elderly patients ( ‰¥65 years of age) or for those with renal impairment. Based on data in adults  no dose adjustment is necessary in pediatric patients with impaired renal function. No clinical data are available on pediatric patients with renal impairment. Brivaracetam is not recommended for patients with end-stage renal disease undergoing dialysis due to lack of data. Exposure to brivaracetam was increased in patients with chronic liver disease. In patients with hepatic impairment  the following adjusted doses  administered in 2 divided doses  approximately 12 hours apart  are recommended for all stages of hepatic impairment: In adults  adolescents and children weighing ‰¥50 kg  a 50 mg/day starting dose is recommended  with a maximum daily dose of 150 mg/day. For adolescents and children weighing from 20 kg to <50 kg  a 1 mg/kg/day is recommended  with a maximum daily dose of 3 mg/kg/day. For children weighing from 10 kg to <20 kg  a 1 mg/kg/day is recommended  with a maximum daily dose of 4 mg/kg/day. No clinical data are available in pediatric patients with hepatic impairment. The efficacy of brivaracetam in pediatric patients aged less than 2 years has not yet been established.Contraindications: Hypersensitivity to the active substance  other pyrrolidone derivatives or any of the excipients. Special warnings and precautions for use: Suicidal ideation and behavior have been reported in patients treated with anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) in several indications  including brivaracetam. Patients should be monitored for signs of suicidal ideation and behaviors and appropriate treatment should be considered. Patients (and caregivers) should be advised to seek medical advice should any signs of suicidal ideation or behavior emerge. Clinical data on the use of brivaracetam in patients with pre-existing hepatic impairment are limited. Dose adjustments are recommended for patients with hepatic impairment. Brivaracetam film-coated tablets contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance  total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take brivaracetam. Brivaracetam film-coated tablets  solution for injection/infusion and oral solution contain less than 1 mmol sodium (23mg) per tablet/vial/ml respectively  that is to say essentially 'sodium free'. Brivaracetam oral solution contains 168 mg sorbitol (E420) in each ml. Patients with hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) should not take this medicinal product. The oral solution contains methyl parahydroxybenzoate (E218)  which may cause allergic reactions (possibly delayed). Brivaracetam oral solution contains propylene glycol (E1520). Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction: In clinical studies  although patient numbers were limited  brivaracetam had no observed benefit over placebo among patients taking concomitant levetiracetam. No additional safety or tolerability concern was observed. In an interaction study between brivaracetam 200 mg single dose and ethanol 0.6 g/L continuous infusion in healthy volunteers  there was no pharmacokinetic interaction  but the effect of alcohol on psychomotor function  attention and memory was approximately doubled with the intake of brivaracetam. Intake of brivaracetam with alcohol is not recommended. In vitro data suggest that brivaracetam has a low interaction potential. The main disposition pathway of brivaracetam ® is by CYP-independent hydrolysis; a second pathway involves hydroxylation mediated by CYP2C19. Brivaracetam plasma concentrations may increase when co-administered with CYP2C19 strong inhibitors (e.g. fluconazole  fluvoxamine)  but the risk of a clinically relevant CYP2C19 mediated interaction is considered to be low. Limited clinical data are available implying that coadministration of cannabidiol may increase the plasma exposure of brivaracetam  possibly through CYP2C19 inhibition  but the clinical relevance is uncertain. In healthy subjects  co-administration with the strong enzyme inducer rifampicin (600 mg/day for 5 days)  decreased brivaracetam area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) by 45%. Prescribers should consider adjusting the dose of brivaracetam in patients starting or ending treatment with rifampicin. Brivaracetam plasma concentrations are decreased when co-administered with strong enzyme-inducing AEDs (carbamazepine  phenobarbital  phenytoin) but no dose adjustment is required. Other strong enzyme inducers such as St John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) may decrease the systemic exposure of brivaracetam. Starting or ending treatment with St John's wort should be done with caution. Brivaracetam at 50 or 150 mg/day did not affect the AUC of midazolam (metabolised by CYP3A4). The risk of clinically relevant CYP3A4 interactions is considered low. In vitro studies have shown that brivaracetam exhibits little or no inhibition of CYP450 isoforms except for CYP2C19 and may therefore increase plasma concentrations of medicinal products metabolised by CYP2C19 (e.g. lansoprazole  omeprazole  diazepam). Brivaracetam did not induce CYP1A1/2 but induced CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 in vitro. No CYP3A4 induction was found in vivo. CYP2B6 induction has not been investigated in vivo and brivaracetam may decrease plasma concentrations of medicinal products metabolised by CYP2B6 (e.g. efavirenz). In vitro interaction studies to determine the potential inhibitory effects on transporters concluded that there were no clinically relevant effects  except for OAT3. In vitro  brivaracetam inhibits OAT3 with a half maximal inhibitory concentration 42-fold higher than the C max at the highest clinical dose. Brivaracetam 200 mg/day may increase plasma concentrations of medicinal products transported by OAT3. Brivaracetam is a moderate reversible inhibitor of epoxide hydrolase  resulting in an increased concentration of carbamazepine epoxide  an active metabolite of carbamazepine. In controlled clinical studies  carbamazepine epoxide plasma concentration increased by a mean of 37%  62% and 98% with little variability at Brivaracetam doses of 50 mg/day  100 mg/day and 200 mg/day  respectively. No safety risks were observed. There was no additive effect of brivaracetam and valproate on the AUC of carbamazepine epoxide. No dose adjustment is needed when brivaracetam is co-administered with carbamazepine  phenobarbital or phenytoin. Brivaracetam had no clinically relevant effect on the plasma concentrations of clobazam  clonazepam  lacosamide  lamotrigine  levetiracetam  oxcarbazepine  phenobarbital  phenytoin  pregabalin  topiramate  valproic acid or zonisamide. There are no data available on the effects of clobazam  clonazepam  lacosamide  pregabalin or zonisamide on brivaracetam plasma concentrations. Co-administration of brivaracetam (100 mg/day) with an oral contraceptive containing ethinylestradiol (0.03 mg) and levonorgestrel (0.15 mg) did not influence the pharmacokinetics of either substance. However  when brivaracetam was co-administered at a dose of 400 mg/day (twice the recommended maximum daily dose)  a reduction in estrogen and progestin AUCs of 27% and 23%  respectively  was observed without impact on suppression of ovulation. Pregnancy: Data on the use of brivaracetam in pregnant women are limited. There are no data on placental transfer in humans  but brivaracetam was shown to readily cross the placenta in rats. The potential risk for humans is unknown. Animal studies did not detect any teratogenic potential of brivaracetam. In clinical studies  adjunctive brivaracetam used concomitantly with carbamazepine induced a dose-related increase in the concentration of the active metabolite  carbamazepine-epoxide. There are insufficient data to determine the clinical significance of this effect in pregnancy. Brivaracetam should not be used during pregnancy unless clinically necessary. Breast-feeding: Brivaracetam is excreted in human breast milk. The decision to discontinue either breastfeeding or brivaracetam should be made based on the benefit of the medicinal product to the mother. In case of co-administration of brivaracetam and carbamazepine  the amount of carbamazepine-epoxide excreted in breast milk could increase. The clinical significance remains unknown. Fertility: No human data on the effect of brivaracetam on fertility are available. There was no effect on fertility in rats. Effects on ability to drive and use machines: Brivaracetam has minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be advised not to drive a car or to operate other potentially hazardous machines until they are familiar with the effects of brivaracetam on their ability to perform such activities. Undesirable effects: The most frequently reported adverse reactions with brivaracetam were somnolence (14.3%) and dizziness (11.0%); they were usually mild-to-moderate in intensity. Somnolence and fatigue were reported at a higher incidence with increasing dose. Very common adverse reactions ( ‰¥1%-<10%) were influenza  decreased appetite  depression  anxiety  insomnia  irritability  convulsion  vertigo  upper respiratory tract infections  cough  nausea  vomiting  constipation and fatigue. Neutropenia was reported in 6/1099 (0.5%) of brivaracetam and none (0/459) of the placebo-treated patients. Four of these subjects had decreased neutrophil counts at baseline. None of the neutropenia cases were severe  required any specific treatment or led to discontinuation of brivaracetam and none had associated infections. Suicidal ideation was reported in 0.3% (3/1099) of brivaracetam and 0.7% (3/459) of placebo-treated patients. In short-term clinical studies of brivaracetam in patients with epilepsy  there were no cases of completed suicide and suicide attempt; however  both were reported in open-label extension studies. The safety profile of brivaracetam observed in children from 1 month of age was consistent with the safety profile observed in adults. In the open label  uncontrolled  long-term studies suicidal ideation was reported in 4.7 % of pediatric patients (assessed from 6 years onwards  more common in adolescents) compared with 2.4 % of adults and behavioral disorders were reported in 24.8 % of pediatric patients compared with 15.1 % of adults. The majority of events were mild or moderate in intensity  were non-serious  and did not lead to discontinuation of study drug. An additional adverse reaction reported in children was psychomotor hyperactivity (4.7 %). No specific pattern of adverse event (AE) was identified in children from 1 month to < 4 years of age when compared to older pediatric age groups. No significant safety information was identified indicating the increasing incidence of a particular AE in this age group. As data available in children younger than 2 years of age are limited  brivaracetam is not indicated in this age range. Limited clinical data are available in neonates. Reactions suggestive of immediate (Type I) hypersensitivity have been reported in a small number of brivaracetam patients (9/3022) during clinical development. Overdose: There is limited clinical experience with brivaracetam overdose in humans. Somnolence and dizziness have been reported in a healthy subject taking a single dose of 1 400 mg of brivaracetam. The following adverse reactions were reported with brivaracetam overdose: nausea  vertigo  balance disorder  anxiety  fatigue  irritability  aggression  insomnia  depression  and suicidal ideation in the post-marketing experience. In general  the adverse reactions associated with brivaracetam overdose were consistent with the known adverse reactions. There is no specific antidote for overdose with brivaracetam. Treatment of an overdose should include general supportive measures. Since <10% of brivaracetam is excreted in urine  haemodialysis is not expected to significantly enhance brivaracetam clearance.Refer to the European Summary of Product Characteristics for other adverse reactions and full prescribing information.https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/product-information/briviact-epar-product-information_en.pdfImportant Safety Information about VIMPAT ® (lacosamide) in the EU 5Therapeutic indications: VIMPAT ® is indicated as monotherapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalization in adults  adolescents and children from 2 years of age with epilepsy. VIMPAT ® is indicated as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalization in adults  adolescents and children from 2 years of age with epilepsy and in the treatment of primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures in adults  adolescents and children from 4 years of age with idiopathic generalized epilepsy.Posology and method of administration: Lacosamide therapy can be initiated with either oral administration (either tablets or syrup) or IV administration (solution for infusion). The physician should prescribe the most appropriate formulation and strength according to weight and dose. A loading dose may be initiated in patients in situations when the physician determines that rapid attainment of lacosamide steady state plasma concentration and therapeutic effect is warranted. It should be administered under medical supervision with consideration of the potential for increased incidence of serious cardiac arrhythmia and Central Nervous System (CNS) adverse reactions. Administration of a loading dose has not been studied in acute conditions such as status epilepticus. Administration of a loading dose has not been studied in children. Use of a loading dose is not recommended in adolescents and children weighing less than 50 kg. No dose adjustment is necessary in mildly and moderately renally impaired adult and pediatric patients (CLCR > 30 ml/min). In pediatric patients weighing 50 kg or more and in adult patients with mild or moderate renal impairment  a loading dose of 200 mg may be considered  but further dose titration (>200 mg daily) should be performed with caution. In pediatric patients weighing 50 kg or more and in adult patients with severe renal impairment (CLCR ‰¤ 30 ml/min) or with end-stage renal disease  a maximum dose of 250 mg/day is recommended and the dose titration should be performed with caution. In pediatric patients weighing less than 50 kg with severe renal impairment (CLCR ‰¤ 30 ml/min) and in those with end-stage renal disease  a reduction of 25 % of the maximum dose is recommended. A maximum dose of 300 mg/day is recommended for pediatric patients weighing 50 kg or more and for adult patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. Based on data in adults  in pediatric patients weighing less than 50 kg with mild to moderate hepatic impairment  a reduction of 25 % of the maximum dose should be applied. Lacosamide should be administered to adult and pediatric patients with severe hepatic impairment only when the expected therapeutic benefits are anticipated to outweigh the possible risks. The dose may need to be adjusted while carefully observing disease activity and potential side effects in the patient. In adolescents and adults weighing 50 kg or more with mild to moderate hepatic impairment a loading dose of 200mg may be considered  but further dose titration (>200 mg daily) should be performed with caution. Lacosamide is not recommended for use in children below the age of 4 years in the treatment of primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures and below the age of 2 years in the treatment of partial-onset seizures as there are limited data on safety and efficacy in these age groups. Contraindications: Hypersensitivity to the active substance or any of the excipients; known second- or third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block. Special warnings and precautions for use: Suicidal ideation and behavior have been reported in patients treated with antiepileptic medicinal products in several indications. Therefore  patients should be monitored for signs of suicidal ideation and behavior and appropriate treatment should be considered. Patients (and caregivers of patients) should be advised to seek medical advice should signs of suicidal ideation or behavior emerge. Dose-related prolongations in PR interval with lacosamide have been observed in clinical studies. Lacosamide should be used with caution in patients with underlying proarrhythmic conditions such as known cardiac conduction problems or severe cardiac diseases (e.g. myocardial ischemia/infarction  heart failure  structural heart disease or cardiac sodium channelopathies) or patients treated with medicinal products affecting cardiac conduction  including antiarrhythmics and sodium channel blocking antiepileptic medicinal products  as well as in elderly patients. In these patients it should be considered to perform an electrocardiogram (ECG) before a lacosamide dose increase above 400mg/day and after lacosamide is titrated to steady-state. In the placebo-controlled clinical studies of lacosamide in epilepsy patients  atrial fibrillation or flutter were not reported; however both have been reported in open-label epilepsy studies and in post-marketing experience. In post-marketing experience  AV block (including second degree or higher AV block) has been reported. In patients with proarrhythmic conditions  ventricular tachyarrhythmia has been reported. In rare cases  these events have led to asystole  cardiac arrest and death in patients with underlying proarrhythmic conditions. Patients should be made aware of the symptoms of cardiac arrhythmia (e.g. slow  rapid or irregular pulse  palpitations  shortness of breath  feeling lightheaded  fainting). Patients should be counselled to seek immediate medical advice if these symptoms occur. Treatment with lacosamide has been associated with dizziness which could increase the occurrence of accidental injury or falls. Therefore  patients should be advised to exercise caution until they are familiar with the potential effects of the medicine. New onset or worsening of myoclonic seizures has been reported in both adult and pediatric patients with primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures (PGTCS)  in particular during titration. In patients with more than one seizure type  the observed benefit of control for one seizure type should be weighed against any observed worsening in another seizure type. The safety and efficacy of lacosamide in pediatric patients with epilepsy syndromes in which focal and generalized seizures may coexist have not been determined. VIMPAT ® syrup contains sodium methyl parahydroxybenzoate (E219) which may cause allergic reactions (possibly delayed). Vimpat Syrup contains sorbitol (E420). Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance should not take this medicine. Sorbitol may cause gastrointestinal discomfort and mild laxative effect. The syrup contains aspartame (E951)  a source of phenylalanine  which may be harmful for people with phenylketonuria. Neither non-clinical nor clinical data are available to assess aspartame use in infants below 12 weeks of age. Vimpat syrup contains propylene glycol (E1520). VIMPAT ® syrup contains 1.42 mg sodium per ml  equivalent to 0.07 % of the WHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. VIMPAT ® solution for infusion contains 59.8 mg sodium per vial  equivalent to 3% of the WHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. Effects on ability to drive and use machines: Lacosamide may have minor to moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Lacosamide treatment has been associated with dizziness or blurred vision. Accordingly  patients should be advised not to drive a car or to operate other potentially hazardous machinery until they are familiar with the effects of lacosamide on their ability to perform such activities. Undesirable effects: The most frequently reported adverse reactions ( ‰¥10%) are dizziness  headache  nausea and diplopia. They were usually mild to moderate in intensity. Some were dose-related and could be alleviated by reducing the dose. Incidence and severity of CNS and gastrointestinal (GI) adverse reactions usually decreased over time. Incidence of CNS adverse reactions such as dizziness may be higher after a loading dose. Other common adverse reactions ( ‰¥1% - <10%) are depression  confusional state  insomnia  balance disorder  myoclonic seizures  ataxia  memory impairment  cognitive disorder  somnolence  tremor  nystagmus  hypoesthesia  dysarthria  disturbance in attention  paresthesia  vision blurred  vertigo  tinnitus  vomiting  constipation  flatulence  dyspepsia  dry mouth  diarrhea  pruritus  rash  muscle spasms  gait disturbance  asthenia  fatigue  irritability  feeling drunk  injection site pain or discomfort (local adverse events associated with intravenous administration)  irritation (local adverse events associated with intravenous administration)  fall  and skin laceration and contusion. The use of lacosamide is associated with dose-related increase in the PR interval. Adverse reactions associated with PR interval prolongation (e.g. atrioventricular block  syncope  bradycardia) may occur. Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Reactions: Multiorgan hypersensitivity reactions (also known as Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms  DRESS) have been reported in patients treated with some antiepileptic medicinal products. These reactions are variable in expression but typically present with fever and rash and can be associated with involvement of different organ systems. If multiorgan hypersensitivity reaction is suspected  lacosamide should be discontinued. The safety profile of lacosamide in adjunctive therapy in pediatric patients with partial-onset seizures was consistent with the safety profile observed in adults. The additional adverse reactions observed in the pediatric population were pyrexia  nasopharyngitis  pharyngitis  decreased appetite  abnormal behavior and lethargy. Somnolence was reported more frequently in the pediatric population ( ‰¥ 1/10) compared to the adult population ( ‰¥ 1/100 to < 1/10).Refer to the European Summary of Product Characteristics for other adverse reactions and full prescribing information.https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/product-information/vimpat-epar-product-information_en.pdfImportant Safety Information about RYSTIGGO ® (rozanolixizumab-noli) in the US 6RYSTIGGO (rozanolixizumab-noli) is a neonatal Fc receptor blocker indicated for the treatment of generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) in adult patients who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) or antimuscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) antibody positive.6WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONSInfections: RYSTIGGO may increase the risk of infection. Delay RYSTIGGO administration in patients with an active infection until the infection is resolved. During treatment with RYSTIGGO  monitor for clinical signs and symptoms of infection. If serious infection occurs  administer appropriate treatment and consider withholding RYSTIGGO until the infection has resolved.ImmunizationImmunization with vaccines during RYSTIGGO treatment has not been studied. The safety of immunization with live or live-attenuated vaccines and the response to immunization with any vaccine are unknown. Because RYSTIGGO causes a reduction in IgG levels  vaccination with live-attenuated or live vaccines is not recommended during treatment with RYSTIGGO. Evaluate the need to administer age-appropriate vaccines according to immunization guidelines before initiation of a new treatment cycle with RYSTIGGO.Aseptic Meningitis: Serious adverse reactions of aseptic meningitis (also called drug-induced aseptic meningitis) have been reported in patients treated with RYSTIGGO. If symptoms consistent with aseptic meningitis develop  diagnostic workup and treatment should be initiated according to the standard of care.Hypersensitivity Reactions: Hypersensitivity reactions  including angioedema and rash  were observed in patients treated with RYSTIGGO. Management of hypersensitivity reactions depends on the type and severity of the reaction. Monitor patients during treatment with RYSTIGGO and for 15 minutes after for clinical signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions. If a reaction occurs  institute appropriate measures if needed.ADVERSE REACTIONSIn a placebo-controlled study  the most common adverse reactions (reported in at least 10% of RYSTIGGO-treated patients) were headache  infections  diarrhea  pyrexia  hypersensitivity reactions  and nausea. Serious infections were reported in 4% of patients treated with RYSTIGGO. Three fatal cases of pneumonia were identified  caused by COVID-19 infection in two patients and an unknown pathogen in one patient. Six cases of infections led to discontinuation of RYSTIGGO.Please see the full Prescribing Information for additional safety information.Important Safety Information about ZILBRYSQ ® (zilucoplan) in the US 7IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION INCLUDING BOXED WARNINGZILBRYSQ is a complement inhibitor indicated for the treatment of generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) in adult patients who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive.7INDICATIONZILBRYSQ (zilucoplan) is indicated for the treatment of generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) in adult patients who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION INCLUDING BOXED WARNINGWARNING: SERIOUS MENINGOCOCCAL INFECTIONSLife-threatening and fatal meningococcal infections have occurred in patients treated with complement inhibitors; ZILBRYSQ is a complement inhibitor. Meningococcal infection may become rapidly life-threatening or fatal if not recognized and treated early.Complete or update meningococcal vaccination (for serogroups A  C  W  and Y  and serogroup B) at least 2 weeks prior to administering the first dose of ZILBRYSQ  unless the risk of delaying therapy outweighs the risk of developing a meningococcal infection. Comply with the most current Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendations for meningococcal vaccinations in patients receiving a complement inhibitor.Persons receiving ZILBRYSQ are at increased risk for invasive disease caused by N. meningitidis  even if they develop antibodies following vaccination. Monitor patients for signs of meningococcal infections and evaluate immediately if infection is suspected.Because of the risk of serious meningococcal infections  ZILBRYSQ is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called ZILBRYSQ REMS.CONTRAINDICATIONSZILBRYSQ is contraindicated in patients with unresolved Neisseria meningitidis infection.WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONSSerious Meningococcal InfectionsLife-threatening and fatal meningococcal infections have occurred in both vaccinated and unvaccinated patients treated with complement inhibitors; ZILBRYSQ is a complement inhibitor. The use of ZILBRYSQ increases a patient's susceptibility to serious and life-threatening meningococcal infections (septicemia and/or meningitis) caused by any serogroup  including non-groupable strains.Complete or update meningococcal vaccination (for both serogroups A  C  W  and Y [MenACWY] and serogroup B [MenB]) at least 2 weeks prior to administering the first dose of ZILBRYSQ  according to current ACIP recommendations for meningococcal vaccinations in patients receiving a complement inhibitor.If urgent ZILBRYSQ therapy is indicated in a patient who is not up to date with both MenACWY and MenB vaccines according to ACIP recommendations  administer meningococcal vaccine(s) as soon as possible and provide the patient with antibacterial drug prophylaxis.Closely monitor patients for early signs and symptoms of meningococcal infection and evaluate patients immediately if infection is suspected. Withhold administration of ZILBRYSQ in patients who are undergoing treatment for meningococcal infection until the infection is resolved.ZILBRYSQ REMSDue to the risk of meningococcal infections  ZILBRYSQ is available only through a restricted program under a REMS called ZILBRYSQ REMS.Under the ZILBRYSQ REMS  prescribers must enroll in the program. Prescribers must counsel patients about the risk of meningococcal infection  provide the patients with the REMS educational materials  and ensure patients are vaccinated with meningococcal vaccines. Additional information on the REMS requirements is available at www.ZILBRYSQREMS.com or 1-877-414-8353.Other InfectionsZILBRYSQ blocks terminal complement activation; therefore  patients may have increased susceptibility to infections  especially with encapsulated bacteria  such as infections caused by Neisseria meningitidis but also Streptococcus pneumoniae  Haemophilus influenzae  and to a lesser extent  Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Administer vaccinations for the prevention of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) infections according to ACIP guidelines. Persons receiving ZILBRYSQ are at increased risk for infections due to these bacteria  even after vaccination.Pancreatitis And Other Pancreatic ConditionsPancreatitis and pancreatic cysts have been reported in patients treated with ZILBRYSQ. Patients should be informed of this risk before starting ZILBRYSQ. Obtain lipase and amylase levels at baseline before starting treatment with ZILBRYSQ. Discontinue ZILBRYSQ in patients with suspected pancreatitis and initiate appropriate management until pancreatitis is ruled out or has resolved.ADVERSE REACTIONSIn a placebo-controlled study  the most common adverse reactions (reported in at least 10% of gMG patients treated with ZILBRYSQ) were injection site reactions  upper respiratory tract infections  and diarrhea.Please see the full Prescribing Information for additional Important Safety Information.Important Safety Information about FINTEPLA ® (fenfluramine) in the US 8INDICATIONS AND USAGEFINTEPLA is indicated for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome (DS) and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) in patients 2 years of age and older.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONBOXED WARNING: VALVULAR HEART DISEASE and PULMONARY ARTERIAL HYPERTENSIONThere is an association between serotonergic drugs with 5-HT2B receptor agonist activity  including fenfluramine (the active ingredient in FINTEPLA)  and valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension.Echocardiogram assessments are required before  during  and after treatment with FINTEPLA.FINTEPLA is available only through a restricted program called the FINTEPLA REMS.CONTRAINDICATIONSFINTEPLA is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to fenfluramine or any of the excipients in FINTEPLA and with concomitant use  or within 14 days of the administration  of monoamine oxidase inhibitors because of an increased risk of serotonin syndrome.WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONSValvular Heart Disease and Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (see Boxed Warning): Because of the association between serotonergic drugs with 5“HT2B receptor agonist activity  including fenfluramine (the active ingredient in FINTEPLA)  and valvular heart disease (VHD) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)  cardiac monitoring via echocardiogram is required prior to starting treatment  during treatment  and after treatment with FINTEPLA concludes. Cardiac monitoring via echocardiogram can aid in early detection of these conditions. In clinical trials for DS and LGS of up to 3 years in duration  no patient receiving FINTEPLA developed VHD or PAH.Monitoring: Prior to starting treatment  patients must undergo an echocardiogram to evaluate for VHD and PAH. Echocardiograms should be repeated every 6 months  and once at 3-6 months post treatment with FINTEPLA.The prescriber must consider the benefits versus the risks of initiating or continuing treatment with FINTEPLA if any of the following signs are observed via echocardiogram: valvular abnormality or new abnormality; VHD indicated by mild or greater aortic regurgitation or moderate or greater mitral regurgitation  with additional characteristics of VHD (eg  valve thickening or restrictive valve motion); PAH indicated by elevated right heart/pulmonary artery pressure (PASP >35 mmHg).FINTEPLA REMS Program (see Boxed Warning): FINTEPLA is available only through a restricted distribution program called the FINTEPLA Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Program. Prescribers must be certified by enrolling in the FINTEPLA REMS. Prescribers must counsel patients receiving FINTEPLA about the risk of VHD and PAH  how to recognize signs and symptoms of VHD and PAH  the need for baseline (pretreatment) and periodic cardiac monitoring via echocardiogram during FINTEPLA treatment  and cardiac monitoring after FINTEPLA treatment. Patients must enroll in the FINTEPLA REMS and comply with ongoing monitoring requirements. The pharmacy must be certified by enrolling in the FINTEPLA REMS and must only dispense to patients who are authorized to receive FINTEPLA. Wholesalers and distributors must only distribute to certified pharmacies. Further information is available at www.FinteplaREMS.com or by telephone at 1-877-964-3649.Decreased Appetite and Decreased Weight: FINTEPLA can cause decreases in appetite and weight. Decreases in weight appear to be dose related. Approximately half of the patients with LGS and most patients with DS resumed the expected measured increases in weight during the open-label extension studies. Weight should be monitored regularly during treatment with FINTEPLA  and dose modifications should be considered if a decrease in weight is observed.Somnolence  Sedation  and Lethargy: FINTEPLA can cause somnolence  sedation  and lethargy. Other central nervous system (CNS) depressants  including alcohol  could potentiate these effects of FINTEPLA. Prescribers should monitor patients for somnolence and sedation and should advise patients not to drive or operate machinery until they have gained sufficient experience on FINTEPLA to gauge whether it adversely affects their ability to drive or operate machinery.Suicidal Behavior and Ideation: Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs)  including FINTEPLA  increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behaviors in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with an AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression  suicidal thoughts or behaviors  or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.Anyone considering prescribing FINTEPLA or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behaviors with the risks of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Should suicidal thoughts and behaviors emerge during treatment  consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs: As with most AEDs  FINTEPLA should generally be withdrawn gradually because of the risk of increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus. If withdrawal is needed because of a serious adverse reaction  rapid discontinuation can be considered.Serotonin Syndrome: Serotonin syndrome  a potentially life-threatening condition  may occur with FINTEPLA  particularly during concomitant administration of FINTEPLA with other serotonergic drugs  including  but not limited to  selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)  tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)  bupropion  triptans  dietary supplements (eg  St. John's Wort  tryptophan)  drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including monoamine oxidase inhibitors [MAOIs]  which are contraindicated with FINTEPLA)  dextromethorphan  lithium  tramadol  and antipsychotics with serotonergic agonist activity. Patients should be monitored for the emergence of signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome  which include mental status changes (eg  agitation  hallucinations  coma)  autonomic instability (eg  tachycardia  labile blood pressure  hyperthermia)  neuromuscular signs (eg  hyperreflexia  incoordination)  and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (eg  nausea  vomiting  diarrhea). If serotonin syndrome is suspected  treatment with FINTEPLA should be stopped immediately and symptomatic treatment should be started.Increase in Blood Pressure: FINTEPLA can cause an increase in blood pressure. Rare cases of significant elevation in blood pressure  including hypertensive crisis  has been reported in adult patients treated with fenfluramine  including patients without a history of hypertension. In clinical trials for DS and LGS of up to 3 years in duration  no pediatric or adult patient receiving FINTEPLA developed hypertensive crisis. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with FINTEPLA.Glaucoma: Fenfluramine can cause mydriasis and can precipitate angle closure glaucoma. Consider discontinuing treatment with FINTEPLA in patients with acute decreases in visual acuity or ocular pain.ADVERSE REACTIONSThe most common adverse reactions observed in DS studies (incidence at least 10% and greater than placebo) were decreased appetite; somnolence  sedation  lethargy; diarrhea; constipation; abnormal echocardiogram; fatigue  malaise  asthenia; ataxia  balance disorder  gait disturbance; blood pressure increased; drooling  salivary hypersecretion; pyrexia; upper respiratory tract infection; vomiting; decreased weight; fall; status epilepticus.The most common adverse reactions observed in the LGS study (incidence at least 10% and greater than placebo) were diarrhea; decreased appetite; fatigue; somnolence; vomiting.DRUG INTERACTIONSStrong CYP1A2  CYP2B6  or CYP3A Inducers: Coadministration with strong CYP1A2  CYP2B6  or CYP3A inducers will decrease fenfluramine plasma concentrations. If coadministration of a strong CYP1A2  CYP2B6  or CYP3A inducer with FINTEPLA is necessary  monitor the patient for reduced efficacy and consider increasing the dosage of FINTEPLA as needed. If a strong CYP1A2  CYP2B6  or CYP3A inducer is discontinued during maintenance treatment with FINTEPLA  consider gradual reduction in the FINTEPLA dosage to the dose administered prior to initiating the inducer.Strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 Inhibitors: Coadministration with strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitors will increase fenfluramine plasma concentrations. If FINTEPLA is coadministered with strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitors  the maximum daily dosage of FINTEPLA is 20 mg. If a strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is discontinued during maintenance treatment with FINTEPLA  consider gradual increase in the FINTEPLA dosage to the dose recommended without CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitors. If FINTEPLA is coadministered with stiripentol and a strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitor  the maximum daily dosage of FINTEPLA is 17 mg.USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONSIn patients with severe impairment of kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]) 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m2  dosage adjustments are recommended. FINTEPLA has not been studied in patients with kidney failure (eGFR <15 mL/min/1.73m2).Combined molar exposures of fenfluramine and norfenfluramine were increased in subjects with various degrees of hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A  B  and C)  necessitating a dosage adjustment in these patients.To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS  contact UCB  Inc. at 1“844-599-2273 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.Please see [directional] full Prescribing Information  including Boxed Warning  for additional Important Safety Information.Important Safety Information about BRIVIACT ® (brivaracetam) CV in the US 9INDICATIONBRIVIACT ® (brivaracetam) CV is indicated for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in patients 1 month of age and older.11IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONSSuicidal Behavior and Ideation: Antiepileptic drugs  including BRIVIACT  increase the risk of suicidal behavior and ideation. Monitor patients taking BRIVIACT for the emergence or worsening of depression; unusual changes in mood or behavior; or suicidal thoughts  behavior  or self-harm. Advise patients  their caregivers  and/or families to be alert for these behavioral changes and report them immediately to a healthcare provider.Neurological Adverse Reactions: BRIVIACT causes somnolence  fatigue  dizziness  and disturbance in coordination. Monitor patients for these signs and symptoms and advise them not to drive or operate machinery until they have gained sufficient experience on BRIVIACT.Psychiatric Adverse Reactions: BRIVIACT causes psychiatric adverse reactions  including non-psychotic and psychotic symptoms in adult and pediatric patients. Advise patients to report these symptoms immediately to a healthcare provider.Hypersensitivity: BRIVIACT can cause hypersensitivity reactions. Bronchospasm and angioedema have been reported. Discontinue BRIVIACT if a patient develops a hypersensitivity reaction after treatment. BRIVIACT is contraindicated in patients with a prior hypersensitivity reaction to brivaracetam or any of the inactive ingredients.Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs: As with all antiepileptic drugs  BRIVIACT should generally be withdrawn gradually because of the risk of increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus.DOSING CONSIDERATIONSDose adjustments are recommended for patients with all stages of hepatic impairment.When BRIVIACT is co-administered with rifampin  an increase in the BRIVIACT dose is recommended.ADVERSE REACTIONSIn adult adjunctive therapy placebo-controlled clinical trials  the most common adverse reactions (at least 5% for BRIVIACT and at least 2% more frequently than placebo) were somnolence and sedation  dizziness  fatigue  and nausea and vomiting symptoms. Adverse reactions reported in clinical studies of pediatric patients were generally similar to those in adult patients. Adverse reactions with BRIVIACT injection in adult and pediatric patients were generally similar to those observed with BRIVIACT tablets. Other adverse events that occurred in adult patients who received BRIVIACT injection included dysgeusia  euphoric mood  feeling drunk  and infusion site pain.BRIVIACT is a Schedule V controlled substance.Please refer to the full Prescribing Information.Important Safety Information about VIMPAT ® (lacosamide) CV in the US 10INDICATIONVIMPAT ® is indicated for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in patients 1 month of age and older.

This will allow quick identification of new safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions.Rystiggo is indicated as an add-on to standard therapy for the treatment of generalised myastheniagravis (gMG) in adult patients who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) or anti-muscle-specifictyrosine kinase (MuSK) antibody positive.1The most commonly reported adverse reactions were headache (48.4 %)  diarrhea (25.0 %) and pyrexia (12.5 %). The adverse reactions from the placebo-controlled study in gMG are as follow: Very common (≥ 1/10) headache  diarrhea and pyrexia; Common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10) rash  angioedema  arthralgia and injection site reactions. Headache was the most common reaction reported in 31 (48.4 %) and 13 (19.4 %) of the patients treated with rozanolixizumab and placebo  respectively. All headaches  except 1 (1.6 %) severe headache  were either mild (28.1 % [n=18]) or moderate (18.8 % [n=12]) and there was no increase in incidences of headache with repeated cyclic treatment.Rozanolixizumab is contra-indicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients.Treatment with rozanolixizumab in patients with impending or manifest myasthenic crisis has not been studied. The sequence of therapy initiation between established therapies for MG crisis and rozanolixizumab  and their potential interactions  should be considered.Aseptic meningitis (drug induced aseptic meningitis) has been reported following rozanolixizumab treatment at a higher dose with subsequent recovery without sequelae after discontinuation. If symptoms consistent with aseptic meningitis occur  diagnostic workup and treatment should be initiated as per standard of care.Due to its mechanism of action  the use of rozanolixizumab may increase the patient's susceptibility to infections. Treatment with rozanolixizumab should not be initiated in patients with a clinically important active infection until the infection is resolved or is adequately treated. During treatment with rozanolixizumab  clinical signs and symptoms of infections should be monitored. If a clinically important active infection occurs  withholding rozanolixizumab until the infection has resolved should be considered.Hypersensitivity reactions including mild to moderate rash or angioedema were observed in patients treated with rozanolixizumab. Patients should be monitored during treatment with rozanolixizumab and for 15 minutes after the administration is complete for clinical signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions. If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs during administration  rozanolixizumab infusion should be discontinued and appropriate measures should be initiated if needed. Once resolved  administration may be resumedImmunization with vaccines during rozanolixizumab therapy has not been studied. The safety of immunization with live or live-attenuated vaccines and the response to immunization with vaccines are unknown. All vaccines should be administered according to immunization guidelines and at least 4 weeks before initiation of treatment. For patients that are on treatment  vaccination with live or live attenuated vaccines is not recommended. For all other vaccines  they should take place at least 2 weeks after the last infusion of a treatment cycle and 4 weeks before initiating the next cycle.Refer to the European Summary of Product Characteristics for other adverse reactions and full prescribing information. https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/product-information/rystiggo-epar-product-information_en.pdf.Important Safety Information about ZILBRYSQ®▼ (zilucoplan) in the EU2▼This medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions.Zilbrysq is indicated as an add-on to standard therapy for the treatment of generalised myastheniagravis (gMG) in adult patients who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive.2The most frequently reported adverse reactions were injection site reactions (injection site bruising (13.9%) and injection site pain (7.0%) and upper respiratory tract infections (nasopharyngitis (5.2%)  upper respiratory tract infection (3.5%) and sinusitis (3.5%). The adverse reactions from the pooled placebo controlled (n=115) and open-label extension (n=213) studies in gMG are as follows: Very common adverse reactions: (≥ 1/10): Upper respiratory tract infections and Injection site reactions; Common adverse reactions (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10) Diarrhea  Lipase increased  Amylase increased and Morphea; Uncommon adverse reaction (≥ 1/1000 to < 1/100) blood eosinophils increased. Zilucoplan is contra-indicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients  in patients who are not currently vaccinated against Neisseria meningitidis and in patients with unresolved Neisseria meningitidis infection. Due to its mechanism of action  the use of zilucoplan may increase the patient's susceptibility to infections with Neisseria meningitidis. As a precautionary measure  all patients must be vaccinated against meningococcal infections  at least 2 weeks prior to the start of treatment. If treatment needs to start less than 2 weeks after vaccination against meningococcal infections  the patient must receive appropriate prophylactic antibiotic treatment until 2 weeks after the first vaccination dose. Meningococcal vaccines reduce but do not completely eliminate the risk of meningococcal infections. Vaccines against serogroups A  C  Y  W  and where available  serogroup B  are recommended for preventing the commonly pathogenic meningococcal serogroups. Vaccination and prophylactic antibiotic treatment should occur according to most current relevant guidelines. During treatment  patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of meningococcal infection and evaluated immediately if infection is suspected. In case of a suspected meningococcal infection  appropriate measures such as treatment with antibiotics and discontinuation of treatment  should be taken until the meningococcal infection can be ruled out. Patients should be instructed to seek immediate medical advice if signs or symptoms of meningococcal infections occur. Prescribers should be familiar with the educational materials for the management of meningococcal infections and provide a patient alert card and patient/carer guide to patients treated with zilucoplan. In addition to Neisseria meningitidis  patients treated with zilucoplan may also be susceptible to infections with other Neisseria species  such as gonococcal infections. Patients should be informed on the importance of gonorrhea prevention and treatment. Prior to initiating zilucoplan therapy  it is recommended that patients initiate immunizations according to current immunization guidelines.

EC Date of approval 01 Dec 2023.Important Safety Information about FINTEPLA®▼ (fenfluramine) in the EU3▼This medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring. This will allow quick identification of new safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions.Indications: Treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome as an add-on therapy to other anti-epileptic medicines for patients 2 years of age and older.Dosage and Administration: Please refer to SmPC for full information. Should be initiated and supervised by physicians with experience in the treatment of epilepsy. Fintepla is prescribed and dispensed according to the Fintepla controlled access programme. Dravet syndrome: Patients who are not taking stiripentol: Starting dose is 0.1 mg/kg twice daily (0.2 mg/kg/day). After 7 days  if tolerated  can increase dose to 0.2 mg/kg twice daily (0.4 mg/kg/day). After an additional 7 days  if tolerated and further seizure reduction required  can increase dose to a maximum of 0.35 mg/kg twice daily (0.7 mg/kg/day)  which is the recommended maintenance dose. Patients requiring more rapid titration may increase the dose every 4 days. Do not exceed maximum daily dose of 26 mg (13 mg twice daily). Patients who are taking stiripentol: Starting dose is 0.1 mg/kg twice daily (0.2 mg/kg/day). After 7 days  if tolerated  can increase dose to 0.2 mg/kg twice daily (0.4 mg/kg/day)  which is the recommended maintenance dose. Patients requiring more rapid titration may increase the dose every 4 days. Do not exceed a total dose of 17 mg (8.6 mg twice daily). Lennox-Gastaut syndrome: Starting dose is 0.1 mg/kg twice daily (0.2 mg/kg/day). After 7 days  the dose should be increased to 0.2 mg/kg twice daily (0.4 mg/kg/day)  if tolerated. After an additional 7 days  if tolerated  dose should be increased to 0.35 mg/kg twice daily (0.7 mg/kg/day)  which is the recommended maintenance dose. Do not exceed maximum daily dose of 26 mg (13 mg twice daily). Discontinuation: When discontinuing treatment  decrease the dose gradually. As with all anti-epileptic medicines  avoid abrupt discontinuation when possible to minimize the risk of increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus. A final echocardiogram should be conducted 3-6 months after the last dose of treatment with fenfluramine. Renal impairment: Generally  no dose adjustment is recommended when administered to patients with mild to severe renal impairment  however  a slower titration may be considered. If adverse reactions are reported  a dose reduction may be needed. Has not been studied in patients with end-stage renal disease. Not known if fenfluramine or its active metabolite  norfenfluramine  is dialyzable. Hepatic impairment: Hepatic impairment: Generally  no dose adjustment is recommended when Fintepla is administered without concomitant stiripentol to patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A and B). In patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) not receiving concomitant stiripentol  the maximum dosage is 0.2mg/kg twice daily  and the maximal total daily dose is 17 mg. There are limited clinical data on the use of Fintepla with stiripentol in patients with mild impaired hepatic function. A slower titration may be considered in patients with hepatic impairment and a dose reduction may be needed if adverse reactions are reported. No clinical data is available on the use of Fintepla with stiripentol in moderate and severe hepatic impairment  therefore not recommended for use. Elderly: No data available. Pediatric population: Safety and efficacy in children below 2 years of age not yet established. No data available. Contraindications: Hypersensitivity to active substance or any excipients. Aortic or mitral valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension. Within 14 days of the administration of monoamine oxidase inhibitors due to an increased risk of serotonin syndrome.Warnings and Precautions: Aortic or mitral valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension: Prior to starting treatment  patients must undergo an echocardiogram to establish a baseline and exclude any pre-existing valvular heart disease or pulmonary hypertension. Conduct echocardiogram monitoring every 6 months for the first 2 years and annually thereafter. If an echocardiogram indicates pathological valvular changes  consider follow-up earlier to evaluate whether the abnormality is persistent. If pathological abnormalities seen on echocardiogram  evaluate the benefit versus risk of continuing fenfluramine treatment with the prescriber  caregiver and cardiologist. Once treatment is discontinued for any reasons  a final echocardiogram should be conducted 3-6 months after the last dose of treatment with fenfluramine. If echocardiogram findings suggestive of pulmonary arterial hypertension  perform a repeat echocardiogram as soon as possible and within 3 months to confirm these findings. If echocardiogram finding is confirmed suggestive of an increased probability of pulmonary arterial hypertension defined as intermediate probability  conduct a benefit-risk evaluation of continuation of Fintepla by the prescriber  carer and cardiologist. If echocardiogram suggests a high probability  it is recommended fenfluramine treatment should be stopped. Decreased appetite and weight loss: Fenfluramine can cause decreased appetite and weight loss - an additive effect can occur in combination with other anti-epileptic medicines such as stiripentol. Monitor the patient's weight. Undertake risk-benefit evaluation before starting treatment if history of anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa. Fintepla controlled access programme: A controlled access programme has been created to 1) prevent off-label use in weight management in obese patients and 2) confirm that prescribing physicians have been informed of the need for periodic cardiac monitoring in patients taking Fintepla. Somnolence: Fenfluramine can cause somnolence which could be potentiated by other central nervous system depressants. Suicidal behaviour and ideation: Suicidal behaviour and ideation have been reported in patients treated with anti-epileptic medicines in several indications. Advise patients and caregivers to seek medical advice should any signs of suicidal behaviour and ideation emerge. Serotonin syndrome: Serotonin syndrome  a potentially life-threatening condition  may occur with fenfluramine treatment  particularly with concomitant use of other serotonergic agents; with agents that impair metabolism of serotonin such as MAOIs; or with antipsychotics that may affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems. Carefully observe the patient  particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases. Increased seizure frequency: A clinically relevant increase in seizure frequency may occur during treatment  which may require adjustment in the dose of fenfluramine and/or concomitant anti-epileptic medicines  or discontinuation of fenfluramine  should the benefit-risk be negative. Cyproheptadine: Cyproheptadine is a potent serotonin receptor antagonist and may therefore decrease the efficacy of fenfluramine. If cyproheptadine is added to treatment with fenfluramine  monitor patient for worsening of seizures. If fenfluramine treatment is initiated in a patient taking cyproheptadine  fenfluramine's efficacy may be reduced. Glaucoma: Fenfluramine can cause mydriasis and can precipitate angle closure glaucoma. Discontinue therapy in patients with acute decreases in visual acuity. Consider discontinuation if ocular pain of unknown origin. Effect of CYP1A2 or CYP2B6 inducers: Co-administration with strong CYP1A2 inducers or CYP2B6 inducers will decrease fenfluramine plasma concentrations  which may lower the efficacy of fenfluramine. If co-administration is considered necessary  the patient should be monitored for reduced efficacy and a dose increase of fenfluramine could be considered provided that it does not exceed twice the maximum daily dose (52 mg/day). If a strong CYP1A2 or CYP2B6 inducer is discontinued during maintenance treatment with fenfluramine  consider gradual reduction of the fenfluramine dosage to the dose administered prior to initiating the inducer. Effect of CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitors: Initiation of concomitant treatment with a strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitor may result in higher exposure and  therefore  adverse events should be monitored  and a dose reduction may be needed in some patients. Excipients: Contains sodium ethyl para-hydroxybenzoate (E 215) and sodium methyl para-hydroxybenzoate (E 219) - may cause allergic reactions (possibly delayed). It also contains sulfur dioxide (E 220) which may rarely cause severe hypersensitivity reactions and bronchospasm. Patients with rare glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. The product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per the maximum daily dose of 12 mL; essentially 'sodium-free'. Contains glucose - may be harmful to teeth. Interactions: Pharmacodynamic interactions with other CNS depressants increase the risk of aggravated central nervous system depression. An increase in dose may be necessary when coadministered with rifampicin or a strong CYP1A2 or CYP2B6 inducer. In in vitro studies co-administration with a strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitor may result in higher exposure (see section 4.4 of the SmPC). Co-administration with CYP2D6 substrates or MATE1 substrates may increase their plasma concentrations. Co-administration with CYP2B6 or CYP3A4 substrates may decrease their plasma concentrations. Pregnancy and lactation: Limited data in pregnant women. As a precaution  avoid use of Fintepla in pregnancy. It is unknown whether fenfluramine/metabolites are excreted in human milk. Animal data have shown excretion of fenfluramine/metabolites in milk. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from Fintepla taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. Drive and use machines.: Fintepla has moderate influence on the ability to drive/ use machines as it may cause somnolence and fatigue. Advise patients not to drive or operate machinery until they have sufficient experience to gauge whether it adversely affects their abilities.Adverse effects: Dravet syndrome: Very common (≥1/10): Upper respiratory tract infection  decreased appetite  somnolence  diarrhoea  pyrexia  fatigue  blood glucose decreased  echocardiogram abnormal (Consisted of trace and mild mitral regurgitation  and trace aortic regurgitation  which are considered physiologic). Common (≥1/100 to <1/10): Bronchitis  abnormal behaviour  aggression  agitation  insomnia  mood swings  ataxia  hypotonia  lethargy  seizure  status epilepticus  tremor  constipation  salivary hypersecretion  weight decreased and blood prolactin increased. Not known (cannot be estimated from the available data): Pulmonary arterial hypertension. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome: Very common (≥1/10): Upper respiratory tract infection  decreased appetite  somnolence  diarrhoea  vomiting  fatigue. Common (≥1/100 to <1/10): Bronchitis  influenza  pneumonia  aggression  seizure  status epilepticus  lethargy  tremor  constipation  salivary hypersecretion  blood prolactin increased  weight decreased  fall.

It is recommended to parent and care giver to administer BRIVIACT oral solution with the measuring device (10 ml or 5 ml oral dosing syringe) provided in the carton box. BRIVIACT solution for injection/infusion is an alternative route of administration for patients when oral administration is temporarily not feasible. There is no experience with twice daily intravenous administration of brivaracetam for a period longer than 4 days. Adults: The recommended starting dose is 50 or 100 mg/day based on physician's assessment of required for seizure reduction versus potential side effects. Brivaracetam can be taken with or without food. Based on individual patient response and tolerability  the dose may be adjusted in the effective dose range of 50 mg/day to 200 mg/day. Children and adolescents weighing 50 kg or more: The recommended starting dose is 50 mg/day. Brivaracetam may also be initiated at 100 mg/day based on physician's assessment of need for seizure control. The recommended maintenance dose is 100 mg/day. Based on individual patient response  the dose may be adjusted in the effective dose range of 50 mg/day to 200 mg/day. Children and adolescents weighing from 20 kg to less than 50 kg: The recommended starting dose is 1 mg/kg/day. Brivaracetam may also be initiated at doses up to 2 mg/kg/day based on physician's assessment of need for seizure control. The recommended maintenance dose is 2 mg/kg/day. Based on individual patient response  the dose may be adjusted in the effective dose range of 1 mg/kg/day to 4 mg/kg/day. Children weighing from 10 kg to less than 20 kg: The recommended starting dose is 1 mg/kg/day. Brivaracetam may also be initiated at doses up to 2.5 mg/kg/day based on physician's assessment of need for seizure control. The recommended maintenance dose is 2.5 mg/kg/day. Based on individual patient response  the dose may be adjusted in the effective dose range of 1 mg/kg/day to 5 mg/kg/day. For adults  adolescents and children from 2 years of age  the dose should be administered in two equally divided doses  approximately 12 hours apart.If patients miss one dose or more  it is recommended that they take a single dose as soon as they remember and take the following dose at the usual morning or evening time. Brivaracetam oral solution can be diluted in water or juice shortly before swallowing; a nasogastric tube or a gastrostomy tube may also be used. Brivaracetam may be initiated with either intravenous or oral administration. When converting from oral to intravenous administration or vice versa  the total daily dose and frequency of administration should be maintained. Brivaracetam may be administered as an intravenous bolus without dilution or diluted in a compatible diluent and administered as a 15-minute intravenous infusion. This medicinal product must not be mixed with other medicinal products. Brivaracetam bolus injection or intravenous infusion has not been studied in acute conditions  e.g. status epilepticus  and is therefore not recommended for such conditions For patients from 16 years of age  if brivaracetam has to be discontinued  it is recommended that the dose is reduced gradually by 50 mg/day on a weekly basis. For patients below the age of 16 years  if brivaracetam has to be discontinued  it is recommended that the dose is reduced by a maximum of half the dose every week until a dose of 1 mg/kg/day (for patients with a body weight less than 50 kg) or 50 mg/day (for patients with body weight of 50 kg or more) is reached. After 1 week of treatment at 50 mg/day  a final week of treatment at 20 mg/day is recommended. No dose adjustment is needed for elderly patients (≥65 years of age) or for those with renal impairment. Based on data in adults  no dose adjustment is necessary in pediatric patients with impaired renal function. No clinical data are available on pediatric patients with renal impairment. Brivaracetam is not recommended for patients with end-stage renal disease undergoing dialysis due to lack of data. Exposure to brivaracetam was increased in patients with chronic liver disease. In patients with hepatic impairment  the following adjusted doses  administered in 2 divided doses  approximately 12 hours apart  are recommended for all stages of hepatic impairment: In adults  adolescents and children weighing ≥50 kg  a 50 mg/day starting dose is recommended  with a maximum daily dose of 150 mg/day. For adolescents and children weighing from 20 kg to <50 kg  a 1 mg/kg/day is recommended  with a maximum daily dose of 3 mg/kg/day. For children weighing from 10 kg to <20 kg  a 1 mg/kg/day is recommended  with a maximum daily dose of 4 mg/kg/day. No clinical data are available in pediatric patients with hepatic impairment. The efficacy of brivaracetam in pediatric patients aged less than 2 years has not yet been established.Contraindications: Hypersensitivity to the active substance  other pyrrolidone derivatives or any of the excipients. Special warnings and precautions for use: Suicidal ideation and behavior have been reported in patients treated with anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) in several indications  including brivaracetam. Patients should be monitored for signs of suicidal ideation and behaviors and appropriate treatment should be considered. Patients (and caregivers) should be advised to seek medical advice should any signs of suicidal ideation or behavior emerge. Clinical data on the use of brivaracetam in patients with pre-existing hepatic impairment are limited. Dose adjustments are recommended for patients with hepatic impairment. Brivaracetam film-coated tablets contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance  total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take brivaracetam. Brivaracetam film-coated tablets  solution for injection/infusion and oral solution contain less than 1 mmol sodium (23mg) per tablet/vial/ml respectively  that is to say essentially 'sodium free'. Brivaracetam oral solution contains 168 mg sorbitol (E420) in each ml. Patients with hereditary fructose intolerance (HFI) should not take this medicinal product. The oral solution contains methyl parahydroxybenzoate (E218)  which may cause allergic reactions (possibly delayed). Brivaracetam oral solution contains propylene glycol (E1520). Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction: In clinical studies  although patient numbers were limited  brivaracetam had no observed benefit over placebo among patients taking concomitant levetiracetam. No additional safety or tolerability concern was observed. In an interaction study between brivaracetam 200 mg single dose and ethanol 0.6 g/L continuous infusion in healthy volunteers  there was no pharmacokinetic interaction  but the effect of alcohol on psychomotor function  attention and memory was approximately doubled with the intake of brivaracetam. Intake of brivaracetam with alcohol is not recommended. In vitro data suggest that brivaracetam has a low interaction potential. The main disposition pathway of brivaracetam® is by CYP-independent hydrolysis; a second pathway involves hydroxylation mediated by CYP2C19. Brivaracetam plasma concentrations may increase when co-administered with CYP2C19 strong inhibitors (e.g. fluconazole  fluvoxamine)  but the risk of a clinically relevant CYP2C19 mediated interaction is considered to be low. Limited clinical data are available implying that coadministration of cannabidiol may increase the plasma exposure of brivaracetam  possibly through CYP2C19 inhibition  but the clinical relevance is uncertain. In healthy subjects  co-administration with the strong enzyme inducer rifampicin (600 mg/day for 5 days)  decreased brivaracetam area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) by 45%. Prescribers should consider adjusting the dose of brivaracetam in patients starting or ending treatment with rifampicin. Brivaracetam plasma concentrations are decreased when co-administered with strong enzyme-inducing AEDs (carbamazepine  phenobarbital  phenytoin) but no dose adjustment is required. Other strong enzyme inducers such as St John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) may decrease the systemic exposure of brivaracetam. Starting or ending treatment with St John's wort should be done with caution. Brivaracetam at 50 or 150 mg/day did not affect the AUC of midazolam (metabolised by CYP3A4). The risk of clinically relevant CYP3A4 interactions is considered low. In vitro studies have shown that brivaracetam exhibits little or no inhibition of CYP450 isoforms except for CYP2C19 and may therefore increase plasma concentrations of medicinal products metabolised by CYP2C19 (e.g. lansoprazole  omeprazole  diazepam). Brivaracetam did not induce CYP1A1/2 but induced CYP3A4 and CYP2B6 in vitro. No CYP3A4 induction was found in vivo. CYP2B6 induction has not been investigated in vivo and brivaracetam may decrease plasma concentrations of medicinal products metabolised by CYP2B6 (e.g. efavirenz). In vitro interaction studies to determine the potential inhibitory effects on transporters concluded that there were no clinically relevant effects  except for OAT3. In vitro  brivaracetam inhibits OAT3 with a half maximal inhibitory concentration 42-fold higher than the Cmax at the highest clinical dose. Brivaracetam 200 mg/day may increase plasma concentrations of medicinal products transported by OAT3. Brivaracetam is a moderate reversible inhibitor of epoxide hydrolase  resulting in an increased concentration of carbamazepine epoxide  an active metabolite of carbamazepine. In controlled clinical studies  carbamazepine epoxide plasma concentration increased by a mean of 37%  62% and 98% with little variability at Brivaracetam doses of 50 mg/day  100 mg/day and 200 mg/day  respectively. No safety risks were observed. There was no additive effect of brivaracetam and valproate on the AUC of carbamazepine epoxide. No dose adjustment is needed when brivaracetam is co-administered with carbamazepine  phenobarbital or phenytoin. Brivaracetam had no clinically relevant effect on the plasma concentrations of clobazam  clonazepam  lacosamide  lamotrigine  levetiracetam  oxcarbazepine  phenobarbital  phenytoin  pregabalin  topiramate  valproic acid or zonisamide. There are no data available on the effects of clobazam  clonazepam  lacosamide  pregabalin or zonisamide on brivaracetam plasma concentrations. Co-administration of brivaracetam (100 mg/day) with an oral contraceptive containing ethinylestradiol (0.03 mg) and levonorgestrel (0.15 mg) did not influence the pharmacokinetics of either substance. However  when brivaracetam was co-administered at a dose of 400 mg/day (twice the recommended maximum daily dose)  a reduction in estrogen and progestin AUCs of 27% and 23%  respectively  was observed without impact on suppression of ovulation. Pregnancy: Data on the use of brivaracetam in pregnant women are limited. There are no data on placental transfer in humans  but brivaracetam was shown to readily cross the placenta in rats. The potential risk for humans is unknown. Animal studies did not detect any teratogenic potential of brivaracetam. In clinical studies  adjunctive brivaracetam used concomitantly with carbamazepine induced a dose-related increase in the concentration of the active metabolite  carbamazepine-epoxide. There are insufficient data to determine the clinical significance of this effect in pregnancy. Brivaracetam should not be used during pregnancy unless clinically necessary. Breast-feeding: Brivaracetam is excreted in human breast milk. The decision to discontinue either breastfeeding or brivaracetam should be made based on the benefit of the medicinal product to the mother. In case of co-administration of brivaracetam and carbamazepine  the amount of carbamazepine-epoxide excreted in breast milk could increase. The clinical significance remains unknown. Fertility: No human data on the effect of brivaracetam on fertility are available. There was no effect on fertility in rats. Effects on ability to drive and use machines: Brivaracetam has minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be advised not to drive a car or to operate other potentially hazardous machines until they are familiar with the effects of brivaracetam on their ability to perform such activities. Undesirable effects: The most frequently reported adverse reactions with brivaracetam were somnolence (14.3%) and dizziness (11.0%); they were usually mild-to-moderate in intensity. Somnolence and fatigue were reported at a higher incidence with increasing dose. Very common adverse reactions (≥1%-<10%) were influenza  decreased appetite  depression  anxiety  insomnia  irritability  convulsion  vertigo  upper respiratory tract infections  cough  nausea  vomiting  constipation and fatigue. Neutropenia was reported in 6/1099 (0.5%) of brivaracetam and none (0/459) of the placebo-treated patients. Four of these subjects had decreased neutrophil counts at baseline. None of the neutropenia cases were severe  required any specific treatment or led to discontinuation of brivaracetam and none had associated infections. Suicidal ideation was reported in 0.3% (3/1099) of brivaracetam and 0.7% (3/459) of placebo-treated patients. In short-term clinical studies of brivaracetam in patients with epilepsy  there were no cases of completed suicide and suicide attempt; however  both were reported in open-label extension studies. The safety profile of brivaracetam observed in children from 1 month of age was consistent with the safety profile observed in adults. In the open label  uncontrolled  long-term studies suicidal ideation was reported in 4.7 % of pediatric patients (assessed from 6 years onwards  more common in adolescents) compared with 2.4 % of adults and behavioral disorders were reported in 24.8 % of pediatric patients compared with 15.1 % of adults. The majority of events were mild or moderate in intensity  were non-serious  and did not lead to discontinuation of study drug. An additional adverse reaction reported in children was psychomotor hyperactivity (4.7 %). No specific pattern of adverse event (AE) was identified in children from 1 month to < 4 years of age when compared to older pediatric age groups. No significant safety information was identified indicating the increasing incidence of a particular AE in this age group. As data available in children younger than 2 years of age are limited  brivaracetam is not indicated in this age range. Limited clinical data are available in neonates. Reactions suggestive of immediate (Type I) hypersensitivity have been reported in a small number of brivaracetam patients (9/3022) during clinical development. Overdose: There is limited clinical experience with brivaracetam overdose in humans. Somnolence and dizziness have been reported in a healthy subject taking a single dose of 1 400 mg of brivaracetam. The following adverse reactions were reported with brivaracetam overdose: nausea  vertigo  balance disorder  anxiety  fatigue  irritability  aggression  insomnia  depression  and suicidal ideation in the post-marketing experience. In general  the adverse reactions associated with brivaracetam overdose were consistent with the known adverse reactions. There is no specific antidote for overdose with brivaracetam. Treatment of an overdose should include general supportive measures. Since <10% of brivaracetam is excreted in urine  haemodialysis is not expected to significantly enhance brivaracetam clearance.Refer to the European Summary of Product Characteristics for other adverse reactions and full prescribing information.https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/product-information/briviact-epar-product-information_en.pdfImportant Safety Information about VIMPAT® (lacosamide) in the EU5Therapeutic indications: VIMPAT® is indicated as monotherapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalization in adults  adolescents and children from 2 years of age with epilepsy. VIMPAT® is indicated as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalization in adults  adolescents and children from 2 years of age with epilepsy and in the treatment of primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures in adults  adolescents and children from 4 years of age with idiopathic generalized epilepsy.Posology and method of administration: Lacosamide therapy can be initiated with either oral administration (either tablets or syrup) or IV administration (solution for infusion). The physician should prescribe the most appropriate formulation and strength according to weight and dose. A loading dose may be initiated in patients in situations when the physician determines that rapid attainment of lacosamide steady state plasma concentration and therapeutic effect is warranted. It should be administered under medical supervision with consideration of the potential for increased incidence of serious cardiac arrhythmia and Central Nervous System (CNS) adverse reactions. Administration of a loading dose has not been studied in acute conditions such as status epilepticus. Administration of a loading dose has not been studied in children. Use of a loading dose is not recommended in adolescents and children weighing less than 50 kg. No dose adjustment is necessary in mildly and moderately renally impaired adult and pediatric patients (CLCR > 30 ml/min). In pediatric patients weighing 50 kg or more and in adult patients with mild or moderate renal impairment  a loading dose of 200 mg may be considered  but further dose titration (>200 mg daily) should be performed with caution. In pediatric patients weighing 50 kg or more and in adult patients with severe renal impairment (CLCR ≤ 30 ml/min) or with end-stage renal disease  a maximum dose of 250 mg/day is recommended and the dose titration should be performed with caution. In pediatric patients weighing less than 50 kg with severe renal impairment (CLCR ≤ 30 ml/min) and in those with end-stage renal disease  a reduction of 25 % of the maximum dose is recommended. A maximum dose of 300 mg/day is recommended for pediatric patients weighing 50 kg or more and for adult patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. Based on data in adults  in pediatric patients weighing less than 50 kg with mild to moderate hepatic impairment  a reduction of 25 % of the maximum dose should be applied. Lacosamide should be administered to adult and pediatric patients with severe hepatic impairment only when the expected therapeutic benefits are anticipated to outweigh the possible risks. The dose may need to be adjusted while carefully observing disease activity and potential side effects in the patient. In adolescents and adults weighing 50 kg or more with mild to moderate hepatic impairment a loading dose of 200mg may be considered  but further dose titration (>200 mg daily) should be performed with caution. Lacosamide is not recommended for use in children below the age of 4 years in the treatment of primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures and below the age of 2 years in the treatment of partial-onset seizures as there are limited data on safety and efficacy in these age groups. Contraindications: Hypersensitivity to the active substance or any of the excipients; known second- or third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block. Special warnings and precautions for use: Suicidal ideation and behavior have been reported in patients treated with antiepileptic medicinal products in several indications. Therefore  patients should be monitored for signs of suicidal ideation and behavior and appropriate treatment should be considered. Patients (and caregivers of patients) should be advised to seek medical advice should signs of suicidal ideation or behavior emerge. Dose-related prolongations in PR interval with lacosamide have been observed in clinical studies. Lacosamide should be used with caution in patients with underlying proarrhythmic conditions such as known cardiac conduction problems or severe cardiac diseases (e.g. myocardial ischemia/infarction  heart failure  structural heart disease or cardiac sodium channelopathies) or patients treated with medicinal products affecting cardiac conduction  including antiarrhythmics and sodium channel blocking antiepileptic medicinal products  as well as in elderly patients. In these patients it should be considered to perform an electrocardiogram (ECG) before a lacosamide dose increase above 400mg/day and after lacosamide is titrated to steady-state. In the placebo-controlled clinical studies of lacosamide in epilepsy patients  atrial fibrillation or flutter were not reported; however both have been reported in open-label epilepsy studies and in post-marketing experience. In post-marketing experience  AV block (including second degree or higher AV block) has been reported. In patients with proarrhythmic conditions  ventricular tachyarrhythmia has been reported. In rare cases  these events have led to asystole  cardiac arrest and death in patients with underlying proarrhythmic conditions. Patients should be made aware of the symptoms of cardiac arrhythmia (e.g. slow  rapid or irregular pulse  palpitations  shortness of breath  feeling lightheaded  fainting). Patients should be counselled to seek immediate medical advice if these symptoms occur. Treatment with lacosamide has been associated with dizziness which could increase the occurrence of accidental injury or falls. Therefore  patients should be advised to exercise caution until they are familiar with the potential effects of the medicine. New onset or worsening of myoclonic seizures has been reported in both adult and pediatric patients with primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures (PGTCS)  in particular during titration. In patients with more than one seizure type  the observed benefit of control for one seizure type should be weighed against any observed worsening in another seizure type. The safety and efficacy of lacosamide in pediatric patients with epilepsy syndromes in which focal and generalized seizures may coexist have not been determined. VIMPAT® syrup contains sodium methyl parahydroxybenzoate (E219) which may cause allergic reactions (possibly delayed). Vimpat Syrup contains sorbitol (E420). Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance should not take this medicine. Sorbitol may cause gastrointestinal discomfort and mild laxative effect. The syrup contains aspartame (E951)  a source of phenylalanine  which may be harmful for people with phenylketonuria. Neither non-clinical nor clinical data are available to assess aspartame use in infants below 12 weeks of age. Vimpat syrup contains propylene glycol (E1520). VIMPAT® syrup contains 1.42 mg sodium per ml  equivalent to 0.07 % of the WHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. VIMPAT® solution for infusion contains 59.8 mg sodium per vial  equivalent to 3% of the WHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. Effects on ability to drive and use machines: Lacosamide may have minor to moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Lacosamide treatment has been associated with dizziness or blurred vision. Accordingly  patients should be advised not to drive a car or to operate other potentially hazardous machinery until they are familiar with the effects of lacosamide on their ability to perform such activities. Undesirable effects: The most frequently reported adverse reactions (≥10%) are dizziness  headache  nausea and diplopia. They were usually mild to moderate in intensity. Some were dose-related and could be alleviated by reducing the dose. Incidence and severity of CNS and gastrointestinal (GI) adverse reactions usually decreased over time. Incidence of CNS adverse reactions such as dizziness may be higher after a loading dose. Other common adverse reactions (≥1% - <10%) are depression  confusional state  insomnia  balance disorder  myoclonic seizures  ataxia  memory impairment  cognitive disorder  somnolence  tremor  nystagmus  hypoesthesia  dysarthria  disturbance in attention  paresthesia  vision blurred  vertigo  tinnitus  vomiting  constipation  flatulence  dyspepsia  dry mouth  diarrhea  pruritus  rash  muscle spasms  gait disturbance  asthenia  fatigue  irritability  feeling drunk  injection site pain or discomfort (local adverse events associated with intravenous administration)  irritation (local adverse events associated with intravenous administration)  fall  and skin laceration and contusion. The use of lacosamide is associated with dose-related increase in the PR interval. Adverse reactions associated with PR interval prolongation (e.g. atrioventricular block  syncope  bradycardia) may occur. Multiorgan Hypersensitivity Reactions: Multiorgan hypersensitivity reactions (also known as Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms  DRESS) have been reported in patients treated with some antiepileptic medicinal products. These reactions are variable in expression but typically present with fever and rash and can be associated with involvement of different organ systems. If multiorgan hypersensitivity reaction is suspected  lacosamide should be discontinued. The safety profile of lacosamide in adjunctive therapy in pediatric patients with partial-onset seizures was consistent with the safety profile observed in adults. The additional adverse reactions observed in the pediatric population were pyrexia  nasopharyngitis  pharyngitis  decreased appetite  abnormal behavior and lethargy. Somnolence was reported more frequently in the pediatric population (≥ 1/10) compared to the adult population (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10).Refer to the European Summary of Product Characteristics for other adverse reactions and full prescribing information.https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/product-information/vimpat-epar-product-information_en.pdfImportant Safety Information about RYSTIGGO® (rozanolixizumab-noli) in the US6RYSTIGGO (rozanolixizumab-noli) is a neonatal Fc receptor blocker indicated for the treatment of generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) in adult patients who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) or antimuscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK) antibody positive.6WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONSInfections: RYSTIGGO may increase the risk of infection. Delay RYSTIGGO administration in patients with an active infection until the infection is resolved. During treatment with RYSTIGGO  monitor for clinical signs and symptoms of infection. If serious infection occurs  administer appropriate treatment and consider withholding RYSTIGGO until the infection has resolved.ImmunizationImmunization with vaccines during RYSTIGGO treatment has not been studied. The safety of immunization with live or live-attenuated vaccines and the response to immunization with any vaccine are unknown. Because RYSTIGGO causes a reduction in IgG levels  vaccination with live-attenuated or live vaccines is not recommended during treatment with RYSTIGGO. Evaluate the need to administer age-appropriate vaccines according to immunization guidelines before initiation of a new treatment cycle with RYSTIGGO.Aseptic Meningitis: Serious adverse reactions of aseptic meningitis (also called drug-induced aseptic meningitis) have been reported in patients treated with RYSTIGGO. If symptoms consistent with aseptic meningitis develop  diagnostic workup and treatment should be initiated according to the standard of care.Hypersensitivity Reactions: Hypersensitivity reactions  including angioedema and rash  were observed in patients treated with RYSTIGGO. Management of hypersensitivity reactions depends on the type and severity of the reaction. Monitor patients during treatment with RYSTIGGO and for 15 minutes after for clinical signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions. If a reaction occurs  institute appropriate measures if needed.ADVERSE REACTIONSIn a placebo-controlled study  the most common adverse reactions (reported in at least 10% of RYSTIGGO-treated patients) were headache  infections  diarrhea  pyrexia  hypersensitivity reactions  and nausea. Serious infections were reported in 4% of patients treated with RYSTIGGO. Three fatal cases of pneumonia were identified  caused by COVID-19 infection in two patients and an unknown pathogen in one patient. Six cases of infections led to discontinuation of RYSTIGGO.The full Prescribing Information is available at https://www.ucb-usa.com/RYSTIGGO-prescribing-information.pdfImportant Safety Information about ZILBRYSQ® (zilucoplan) in the US7IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION INCLUDING BOXED WARNINGZILBRYSQ is a complement inhibitor indicated for the treatment of generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) in adult patients who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive.7INDICATIONZILBRYSQ (zilucoplan) is indicated for the treatment of generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) in adult patients who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION INCLUDING BOXED WARNINGWARNING: SERIOUS MENINGOCOCCAL INFECTIONSLife-threatening and fatal meningococcal infections have occurred in patients treated with complement inhibitors; ZILBRYSQ is a complement inhibitor. Meningococcal infection may become rapidly life-threatening or fatal if not recognized and treated early.• Complete or update meningococcal vaccination (for serogroups A  C  W  and Y  and serogroup B) at least 2 weeks prior to administering the first dose of ZILBRYSQ  unless the risk of delaying therapy outweighs the risk of developing a meningococcal infection. Comply with the most current Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommendations for meningococcal vaccinations in patients receiving a complement inhibitor.• Persons receiving ZILBRYSQ are at increased risk for invasive disease caused by N. meningitidis  even if they develop antibodies following vaccination. Monitor patients for signs of meningococcal infections and evaluate immediately if infection is suspected.Because of the risk of serious meningococcal infections  ZILBRYSQ is available only through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called ZILBRYSQ REMS.CONTRAINDICATIONSZILBRYSQ is contraindicated in patients with unresolved Neisseria meningitidis infection.WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONSSerious Meningococcal InfectionsLife-threatening and fatal meningococcal infections have occurred in both vaccinated and unvaccinated patients treated with complement inhibitors; ZILBRYSQ is a complement inhibitor. The use of ZILBRYSQ increases a patient's susceptibility to serious and life-threatening meningococcal infections (septicemia and/or meningitis) caused by any serogroup  including non-groupable strains.Complete or update meningococcal vaccination (for both serogroups A  C  W  and Y [MenACWY] and serogroup B [MenB]) at least 2 weeks prior to administering the first dose of ZILBRYSQ  according to current ACIP recommendations for meningococcal vaccinations in patients receiving a complement inhibitor.If urgent ZILBRYSQ therapy is indicated in a patient who is not up to date with both MenACWY and MenB vaccines according to ACIP recommendations  administer meningococcal vaccine(s) as soon as possible and provide the patient with antibacterial drug prophylaxis.Closely monitor patients for early signs and symptoms of meningococcal infection and evaluate patients immediately if infection is suspected. Withhold administration of ZILBRYSQ in patients who are undergoing treatment for meningococcal infection until the infection is resolved.ZILBRYSQ REMSDue to the risk of meningococcal infections  ZILBRYSQ is available only through a restricted program under a REMS called ZILBRYSQ REMS.Under the ZILBRYSQ REMS  prescribers must enroll in the program. Prescribers must counsel patients about the risk of meningococcal infection  provide the patients with the REMS educational materials  and ensure patients are vaccinated with meningococcal vaccines. Additional information on the REMS requirements is available at www.ZILBRYSQREMS.com or 1-877-414-8353.Other InfectionsZILBRYSQ blocks terminal complement activation; therefore  patients may have increased susceptibility to infections  especially with encapsulated bacteria  such as infections caused by Neisseria meningitidis but also Streptococcus pneumoniae  Haemophilus influenzae  and to a lesser extent  Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Administer vaccinations for the prevention of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) infections according to ACIP guidelines. Persons receiving ZILBRYSQ are at increased risk for infections due to these bacteria  even after vaccination.Pancreatitis And Other Pancreatic ConditionsPancreatitis and pancreatic cysts have been reported in patients treated with ZILBRYSQ. Patients should be informed of this risk before starting ZILBRYSQ. Obtain lipase and amylase levels at baseline before starting treatment with ZILBRYSQ. Discontinue ZILBRYSQ in patients with suspected pancreatitis and initiate appropriate management until pancreatitis is ruled out or has resolved.ADVERSE REACTIONSIn a placebo-controlled study  the most common adverse reactions (reported in at least 10% of gMG patients treated with ZILBRYSQ) were injection site reactions  upper respiratory tract infections  and diarrhea.The full Prescribing Information is available at https://www.ucb-usa.com/zilbrysq-prescribing-information.pdfImportant Safety Information about FINTEPLA® (fenfluramine) in the US8INDICATIONS AND USAGEFINTEPLA is indicated for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome (DS) and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) in patients 2 years of age and older.8IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONBOXED WARNING: VALVULAR HEART DISEASE and PULMONARY ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION• There is an association between serotonergic drugs with 5-HT2B receptor agonist activity  including fenfluramine (the active ingredient in FINTEPLA)  and valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension.• Echocardiogram assessments are required before  during  and after treatment with FINTEPLA.• FINTEPLA is available only through a restricted program called the FINTEPLA REMS.CONTRAINDICATIONSFINTEPLA is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to fenfluramine or any of the excipients in FINTEPLA and with concomitant use  or within 14 days of the administration  of monoamine oxidase inhibitors because of an increased risk of serotonin syndrome.WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONSValvular Heart Disease and Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (see Boxed Warning): Because of the association between serotonergic drugs with 5 HT2B receptor agonist activity  including fenfluramine (the active ingredient in FINTEPLA)  and valvular heart disease (VHD) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH)  cardiac monitoring via echocardiogram is required prior to starting treatment  during treatment  and after treatment with FINTEPLA concludes. Cardiac monitoring via echocardiogram can aid in early detection of these conditions. In clinical trials for DS and LGS of up to 3 years in duration  no patient receiving FINTEPLA developed VHD or PAH.Monitoring : Prior to starting treatment  patients must undergo an echocardiogram to evaluate for VHD and PAH. Echocardiograms should be repeated every 6 months  and once at 3-6 months post treatment with FINTEPLA.The prescriber must consider the benefits versus the risks of initiating or continuing treatment with FINTEPLA if any of the following signs are observed via echocardiogram: valvular abnormality or new abnormality; VHD indicated by mild or greater aortic regurgitation or moderate or greater mitral regurgitation  with additional characteristics of VHD (eg  valve thickening or restrictive valve motion); PAH indicated by elevated right heart/pulmonary artery pressure (PASP >35 mmHg).FINTEPLA REMS Program (see Boxed Warning): FINTEPLA is available only through a restricted distribution program called the FINTEPLA Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) Program. Prescribers must be certified by enrolling in the FINTEPLA REMS. Prescribers must counsel patients receiving FINTEPLA about the risk of VHD and PAH  how to recognize signs and symptoms of VHD and PAH  the need for baseline (pretreatment) and periodic cardiac monitoring via echocardiogram during FINTEPLA treatment  and cardiac monitoring after FINTEPLA treatment. Patients must enroll in the FINTEPLA REMS and comply with ongoing monitoring requirements. The pharmacy must be certified by enrolling in the FINTEPLA REMS and must only dispense to patients who are authorized to receive FINTEPLA. Wholesalers and distributors must only distribute to certified pharmacies. Further information is available at www.FinteplaREMS.com or by telephone at 1-877-964-3649.Decreased Appetite and Decreased Weight: FINTEPLA can cause decreases in appetite and weight. Decreases in weight appear to be dose related. Approximately half of the patients with LGS and most patients with DS resumed the expected measured increases in weight during the open-label extension studies. Weight should be monitored regularly during treatment with FINTEPLA  and dose modifications should be considered if a decrease in weight is observed.Somnolence  Sedation  and Lethargy: FINTEPLA can cause somnolence  sedation  and lethargy. Other central nervous system (CNS) depressants  including alcohol  could potentiate these effects of FINTEPLA. Prescribers should monitor patients for somnolence and sedation and should advise patients not to drive or operate machinery until they have gained sufficient experience on FINTEPLA to gauge whether it adversely affects their ability to drive or operate machinery.Suicidal Behavior and Ideation: Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs)  including FINTEPLA  increase the risk of suicidal thoughts or behaviors in patients taking these drugs for any indication. Patients treated with an AED for any indication should be monitored for the emergence or worsening of depression  suicidal thoughts or behaviors  or any unusual changes in mood or behavior.Anyone considering prescribing FINTEPLA or any other AED must balance the risk of suicidal thoughts or behaviors with the risks of untreated illness. Epilepsy and many other illnesses for which AEDs are prescribed are themselves associated with morbidity and mortality and an increased risk of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. Should suicidal thoughts and behaviors emerge during treatment  consider whether the emergence of these symptoms in any given patient may be related to the illness being treated.Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs: As with most AEDs  FINTEPLA should generally be withdrawn gradually because of the risk of increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus. If withdrawal is needed because of a serious adverse reaction  rapid discontinuation can be considered.Serotonin Syndrome: Serotonin syndrome  a potentially life-threatening condition  may occur with FINTEPLA  particularly during concomitant administration of FINTEPLA with other serotonergic drugs  including  but not limited to  selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)  tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)  bupropion  triptans  dietary supplements (eg  St. John's Wort  tryptophan)  drugs that impair metabolism of serotonin (including monoamine oxidase inhibitors [MAOIs]  which are contraindicated with FINTEPLA)  dextromethorphan  lithium  tramadol  and antipsychotics with serotonergic agonist activity. Patients should be monitored for the emergence of signs and symptoms of serotonin syndrome  which include mental status changes (eg  agitation  hallucinations  coma)  autonomic instability (eg  tachycardia  labile blood pressure  hyperthermia)  neuromuscular signs (eg  hyperreflexia  incoordination)  and/or gastrointestinal symptoms (eg  nausea  vomiting  diarrhea). If serotonin syndrome is suspected  treatment with FINTEPLA should be stopped immediately and symptomatic treatment should be started.Increase in Blood Pressure: FINTEPLA can cause an increase in blood pressure. Rare cases of significant elevation in blood pressure  including hypertensive crisis  has been reported in adult patients treated with fenfluramine  including patients without a history of hypertension. In clinical trials for DS and LGS of up to 3 years in duration  no pediatric or adult patient receiving FINTEPLA developed hypertensive crisis. Monitor blood pressure in patients treated with FINTEPLA.Glaucoma: Fenfluramine can cause mydriasis and can precipitate angle closure glaucoma. Consider discontinuing treatment with FINTEPLA in patients with acute decreases in visual acuity or ocular pain.ADVERSE REACTIONSThe most common adverse reactions observed in DS studies (incidence at least 10% and greater than placebo) were decreased appetite; somnolence  sedation  lethargy; diarrhea; constipation; abnormal echocardiogram; fatigue  malaise  asthenia; ataxia  balance disorder  gait disturbance; blood pressure increased; drooling  salivary hypersecretion; pyrexia; upper respiratory tract infection; vomiting; decreased weight; fall; status epilepticus.The most common adverse reactions observed in the LGS study (incidence at least 10% and greater than placebo) were diarrhea; decreased appetite; fatigue; somnolence; vomiting.DRUG INTERACTIONSStrong CYP1A2  CYP2B6  or CYP3A Inducers: Coadministration with strong CYP1A2  CYP2B6  or CYP3A inducers will decrease fenfluramine plasma concentrations. If coadministration of a strong CYP1A2  CYP2B6  or CYP3A inducer with FINTEPLA is necessary  monitor the patient for reduced efficacy and consider increasing the dosage of FINTEPLA as needed. If a strong CYP1A2  CYP2B6  or CYP3A inducer is discontinued during maintenance treatment with FINTEPLA  consider gradual reduction in the FINTEPLA dosage to the dose administered prior to initiating the inducer.Strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 Inhibitors: Coadministration with strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitors will increase fenfluramine plasma concentrations. If FINTEPLA is coadministered with strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitors  the maximum daily dosage of FINTEPLA is 20 mg. If a strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitor is discontinued during maintenance treatment with FINTEPLA  consider gradual increase in the FINTEPLA dosage to the dose recommended without CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitors. If FINTEPLA is coadministered with stiripentol and a strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitor  the maximum daily dosage of FINTEPLA is 17 mg.USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONSIn patients with severe impairment of kidney function (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]) 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m2  dosage adjustments are recommended. FINTEPLA has not been studied in patients with kidney failure (eGFR <15 mL/min/1.73m2).Combined molar exposures of fenfluramine and norfenfluramine were increased in subjects with various degrees of hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A  B  and C)  necessitating a dosage adjustment in these patients.To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS  contact UCB  Inc. at 1 844-599-2273 or FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.The full Prescribing Information is available at https://www.ucb.com/sites/default/files/2023-12/Fintepla_Current_COL_12_2023.pdfImportant Safety Information about BRIVIACT® (brivaracetam) CV in the US9INDICATIONBRIVIACT® (brivaracetam) CV is indicated for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in patients 1 month of age and older.11IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONWARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONSSuicidal Behavior and Ideation: Antiepileptic drugs  including BRIVIACT  increase the risk of suicidal behavior and ideation. Monitor patients taking BRIVIACT for the emergence or worsening of depression; unusual changes in mood or behavior; or suicidal thoughts  behavior  or self-harm. Advise patients  their caregivers  and/or families to be alert for these behavioral changes and report them immediately to a healthcare provider.Neurological Adverse Reactions: BRIVIACT causes somnolence  fatigue  dizziness  and disturbance in coordination. Monitor patients for these signs and symptoms and advise them not to drive or operate machinery until they have gained sufficient experience on BRIVIACT.Psychiatric Adverse Reactions: BRIVIACT causes psychiatric adverse reactions  including non-psychotic and psychotic symptoms in adult and pediatric patients. Advise patients to report these symptoms immediately to a healthcare provider.Hypersensitivity: BRIVIACT can cause hypersensitivity reactions. Bronchospasm and angioedema have been reported. Discontinue BRIVIACT if a patient develops a hypersensitivity reaction after treatment. BRIVIACT is contraindicated in patients with a prior hypersensitivity reaction to brivaracetam or any of the inactive ingredients.Withdrawal of Antiepileptic Drugs: As with all antiepileptic drugs  BRIVIACT should generally be withdrawn gradually because of the risk of increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus.DOSING CONSIDERATIONSDose adjustments are recommended for patients with all stages of hepatic impairment.When BRIVIACT is co-administered with rifampin  an increase in the BRIVIACT dose is recommended.ADVERSE REACTIONSIn adult adjunctive therapy placebo-controlled clinical trials  the most common adverse reactions (at least 5% for BRIVIACT and at least 2% more frequently than placebo) were somnolence and sedation  dizziness  fatigue  and nausea and vomiting symptoms. Adverse reactions reported in clinical studies of pediatric patients were generally similar to those in adult patients. Adverse reactions with BRIVIACT injection in adult and pediatric patients were generally similar to those observed with BRIVIACT tablets. Other adverse events that occurred in adult patients who received BRIVIACT injection included dysgeusia  euphoric mood  feeling drunk  and infusion site pain.BRIVIACT is a Schedule V controlled substance.The full Prescribing Information is available at: https://www.ucb.com/_up/ucb_com_products/documents/Briviact-Full-Prescribing-Information-Rev-8.2021.pdfImportant Safety Information about VIMPAT® (lacosamide) CV in the US10INDICATIONVIMPAT® is indicated for the treatment of partial-onset seizures in patients 1 month of age and older. VIMPAT is indicated as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures in patients 4 years of age and older.13VIMPAT IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONVIMPAT is associated with important warnings and precautions including suicidal behavior and ideation  dizziness and ataxia  cardiac rhythm and conduction abnormalities  syncope  and Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS)  also known as multi-organ hypersensitivity.Partial-Onset SeizuresIn the adult adjunctive placebo-controlled trials for partial-onset seizures  the most common adverse reactions (≥10% and greater than placebo) were dizziness  headache  nausea  and diplopia. In the adult monotherapy clinical trial  adverse reactions were generally similar to those observed and attributed to drug in adjunctive placebo-controlled trials  with the exception of insomnia (observed at a higher rate of ≥2%). Pediatric adverse reactions were similar to those seen in adult patients.Primary Generalized Tonic-Clonic SeizuresIn the adjunctive therapy placebo-controlled trial for primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures  the adverse reactions were generally similar to those that occurred in the partial-onset seizures trials. The adverse reactions most commonly reported were dizziness  somnolence  headache  and nausea.The adverse reactions associated with VIMPAT injection in adult patients with primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures are expected to be similar to those seen in adults with partial-onset seizures. The adverse reactions associated with VIMPAT injection in pediatric patients are expected to be similar to those noted in adults. Infusion times less than 30 minutes were not adequately studied in pediatric patients.VIMPAT contains lacosamide  a Schedule V controlled substance.Please refer to the full Prescribing Information.¬¬BRIVIACT®  FINTEPLA®  RYSTIGGO®  and ZILBRYSQ® are registered trademarks of the UCB Group of Companies.

Important factors that could result in such differences include: the global spread and impact of COVID-19  changes in general economic  business and competitive conditions  the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing  costs associated with research and development  changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB  effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations  safety  quality  data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches  or disruptions of our information technology systems  product liability claims  challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates  competition from other products including biosimilars  changes in laws or regulations  exchange rate fluctuations  changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws  and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline  will progress to product approval or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far  the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models  cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products  which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to differences disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB's efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also  UCB or others could discover safety  side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB's products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover  sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment  including pricing pressure  political and public scrutiny  customer and prescriber patterns or practices  and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes.
