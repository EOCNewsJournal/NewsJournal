According to BeinCrypto  the initiative by the bank developed in partnership with Bitpanda exchange indicates a growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies and digital assets by traditional banking institutions.,Landesbank Baden-Württemberg (LBBW)  Germany’s largest federal bank has responded to a rising demand by its clients for digital assets by planning to offer crypto custody services.According to BeinCrypto  the initiative by the bank developed in partnership with Bitpanda exchange indicates a growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies and digital assets by traditional banking institutions.LBBW boasts of about $355 billion in assets and its entrance into cryptocurrency is a significant event capable of launching a bull run.By the second half of 2024  LBBW and Bitpanda hope to offer Cryptocurrency custody services to their institutional and corporate clients.The announcement follows a rising demand for digital assets among such clients  as noted by Jürgen Harengel  managing director of corporate banking at LBBW.“The demand from our corporate customers for digital assets is increasing ” Harengel said.LBBW’s venture into Crypto custodial services is part of a broader trend in the German financial ecosystem. Banks and Asset managers are increasingly adopting crypto services in response to a growing demand for those services by their clients.A forthcoming European Union crypto regulation drives these efforts by banks and asset managers in the country. The regulations are expected to bring clarity and stability to the handling of digital assets fighting the unstable nature of digital assets.Other German Banks making a foray into cryptocurrency include Deutsche Bank with its digital-asset custody service  Crypto Finance  a subsidiary of Deutsche Borse with its license to provide comprehensive crypto trading  settlement  and custody services to institutional investors within Germany  and Commerzbank AG which has received approval from German regulators to establish a crypto custody business.Such initiatives indicate a wider interest by German banks to inculcate Crypto services into the general service they offer their clients signaling a gradual acceptance of cryptocurrency by traditional banking institutions.What To KnowGermany has proven to be a crypto-friendly country.

39236,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/deutsche-boerse-dboey-upgraded-buy-160010131.html,Deutsche Boerse (DBOEY) Upgraded to Buy: What Does It Mean for the Stock?,Deutsche Boerse (DBOEY) has been upgraded to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy)  reflecting growing optimism about the company's earnings prospects. This might drive the stock higher in the near term.,Deutsche Boerse AG (DBOEY) could be a solid addition to your portfolio given its recent upgrade to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). This upgrade is essentially a reflection of an upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.The sole determinant of the Zacks rating is a company's changing earnings picture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate -- the consensus of EPS estimates from the sell-side analysts covering the stock -- for the current and following years is tracked by the system.The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors  since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts. These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.Therefore  the Zacks rating upgrade for Deutsche Boerse basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.ADVERTISEMENTMost Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential  as reflected in earnings estimate revisions  and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship  as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock  and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.For Deutsche Boerse  rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.Story continuesHarnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements  so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role  as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.The Zacks Rank stock-rating system  which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups  ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell)  has an impressive externally-audited track record  with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>.Earnings Estimate Revisions for Deutsche BoerseThis company is expected to earn $1.06 per share for the fiscal year ending December 2024  which represents a year-over-year change of -1.9%.Analysts have been steadily raising their estimates for Deutsche Boerse. Over the past three months  the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 0.5%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations  the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions  only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating. So  the placement of a stock in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks indicates its superior earnings estimate revision feature  making it a solid candidate for producing market-beating returns in the near term.You can learn more about the Zacks Rank here >>>The upgrade of Deutsche Boerse to a Zacks Rank #2 positions it in the top 20% of the Zacks-covered stocks in terms of estimate revisions  implying that the stock might move higher in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Work on this new 18 000 sq.m platform has started in the Jardin d'Entreprises economic activity zone. Connected by the A11 motorway  the Chartres ring road and tomorrow by the future A154 motorway  this area is the economic heart of the Chartres Metropolitan area.This new state-of-the-art logistics site will be operated under a fixed-term ten-year lease in future state of completion.The future site will be made up of three cells: two with controlled temperatures (15°C/25°C) and one refrigerated (2°C/8°C). It will bring together all the future operator's logistics activities on a single platform and thus drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions by consolidating transport flows and eliminating shuttles between different sites.This Premium site will be labelled Aut0nom®. Equipped with a photovoltaic plant on the roof coupled with energy storage batteries  it will produce its own green energy for its own consumption. Heating and cooling of the site will be provided by electric heat pumps and lighting by intelligent LEDs with presence and brightness detectors. All this equipment will make it possible to drastically reduce the site's CO 2 emissions during the operational phase. The residual will be compensated through an ambitious reforestation plan carried out in France.Delivery of the site is expected at the beginning of 2025.2024 financial calendar (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)July 1: Net sales of 2 nd quarter 2024quarter 2024 July 24: Half-year results 2024October 1: Net sales of 3rd quarter 20242025 financial calendar (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)January 3: Net sales of 4 th quarter 2024quarter 2024 January 16: Annual results 2024March 20: General Assembly 2025About ARGANARGAN is the only French real estate company specializing in the DEVELOPMENT & RENTAL OF PREMIUM WAREHOUSES listed on EURONEXT and is the leading player of its market in France.
