The successful and sustainable implementation of the company's business mission  goals and strategy to safeguard the Company's long-term interests require the Company to recruit and retain qualified employees. The guidelines support this in that senior executives can be offered a market- based and competitive total compensation in relation to responsibility and authority. Forms of compensation etc. Compensation must be market-based and competitive and be related to individual performance as well as the Company's performance. Compensation may consist of the following components: fixed cash salary  short-term variable cash compensation  pension benefits and other benefits. Short-term variable cash compensation may amount to a maximum of 50 percent of fixed annual cash salary. Compensation must be linked to fulfillment of individual criteria which are determined annually and evaluated based on the executive's effort and performance. Criteria may be financial or non- financial  and consist of individually adapted quantitative or qualitative goals. Criteria must be designed so that they have a clear connection to value creation for the Company and promote the Company's business mission and a sustainable implementation of the Company's long-term interests. Fulfillment of criteria for payment of short-term variable cash compensation must be measured over a period of one year. The Compensation Committee is responsible for assessing to what extent criteria for payment of short-term variable cash compensation to the CEO have been met. The Board then determines the compensation for the CEO. The CEO is responsible for the assessment of fulfillment of the criteria for short-term variable cash compensation to other senior executives. Short-term variable cash compensation shall not be pensionable. The Board must have the opportunity  according to law or agreement  with the limitations that may follow therefrom  wholly or partially reclaim variable cash compensation paid on incorrect grounds. Pension benefits  including health insurance  must be defined contributions  unless the executive has a defined benefit pension according to mandatory collective bargaining provisions. Premiums and other costs due to defined contribution pension benefits are paid to the CEO and other senior executives in a total amount of up to 40 percent of fixed annual cash salary  depending on the senior executive's position.

The Chairman of the Nomination Committee may not be a Board member. If a member of the Nomination Committee resigns before the Nomination Committee's assignment is completed  the shareholder shall be entitled to appoint a new member. The Chairman of the Board shall convene the first meeting of the Nomination Committee. The composition and contact details of the Nomination Committee shall be made public no later than six months before the AGM on the Company's website. Changes in the composition of the Nomination Committee shall made public immediately. A majority of the members shall be independent in relation to the Company and its management. The CEO or any other person from the Company's management shall not be a member of the Nomination Committee.

No remuneration shall be paid to the members of the Nomination Committee with the exception of reasonable expenses to be reimbursed by the Company. The Nomination Committee is appointed for the period until the next Nomination Committee is appointed. If a nominating shareholder wishes to replace a member of the Nomination Committee appointed by the shareholder with another person  such a request (containing the two relevant names) shall be sent to the Chairman of the Nomination Committee (or in the event that it is the Chairman who is to be replaced  to another member of the Nomination Committee) and the receipt shall mean that the request has been executed.

The shareholder who has been added among the four largest shareholders shall be consulted and have the right to appoint a member. The members of the Nomination Committee shall not be replaced if there are only marginal changes in the number of votes or if most of the Nomination Committee's work by the Chairman of the Nomination Committee is deemed to be completed before the Annual General Meeting.

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS' PROPOSALS UNDER ITEMS 8B  15  16  17  18 AND 19 Item 8B - Resolution regarding allocation of the Company's profits or losses in accordance with the adopted balance sheet The Board of Directors proposes that the funds at the Annual General Meetings' disposal  SEK 5 939 258 162 shall be carried forward  and  thus  that no dividend shall be paid. Item 15 - Submission and approval of the Board's remuneration report The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to approve the Remuneration Report for the financial year 2023 that has been prepared by the Board of Directors. Item 16 - Resolution to adopt guidelines for remuneration to the executive management The Board of Directors of BICO proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves on the following guidelines for remuneration to Executives. Scope These guidelines cover the CEO and other individuals who  during the validity period of the guidelines  are included in the executive management of BICO and the Board of Directors  insofar directors are paid remuneration besides what has been decided by the General Meeting  below referred to as (""Executives""). Further  BICO will in principle apply these guidelines in respect of remuneration to senior executives of BICO's operational companies. These guidelines are forward-looking  i.e. they are applicable to remuneration agreed  and amendments to remuneration already agreed  after adoption of the guidelines by the Annual General Meeting 2024. These guidelines do not apply to any remuneration decided or approved by the General Meeting. For employments governed by rules other than Swedish  pension benefits and other benefits may be duly adjusted for compliance with mandatory rules or established local practice  taking into account  to the extent possible  the overall purpose of these guidelines. Promotion of BICO's business strategy  long-term interests and sustainability  etc. A prerequisite for successful implementation of BICO's business strategy and safeguarding the Company's long-term interests is that BICO is able to recruit and retain qualified personnel. The main principle is that remuneration and other employment conditions for Executives shall be in line with market terms and competitive on every market where BICO operates  to ensure that 6competent and skilled personnel can be attracted  motivated and retained. Individual levels of remuneration shall be based on experience  competence  level of responsibility and performance  and also the country where the Executive is employed. These guidelines promote BICO's business strategy  long-term interests and sustainability as described in the below section regarding criteria for variable remuneration  and contribute to the Company's ability to  on a long-term basis  retain qualified personnel. For further information about the BICO's business strategy  please see the Company's annual reports and the website  see www.bico.com. BICO currently has two long term share-based incentive programs in place aimed at all BICO group employees. The purpose of the incentive programs is to encourage broad share ownership among BICO's employees  facilitate recruitment  retain competent employees and increase motivation to achieve or exceed the Company's financial targets. As such  both of the programs have been free of charge and are conditional on that certain financial conditions are met during the vesting period. These programs have been resolved by the General Meeting in 2021 and 2022 and are therefore excluded from these guidelines. For the same reason  the long-termshare-related incentive program proposed by the Board of Directors and submitted to the Annual General Meeting 2024 for approval is excluded. The proposed programs deviate from the existing programs as they are based on the residence of the participants and thus consist of partly warrants and partly staff options to approx. 16 key people within the BICO group. The programs are further conditional on either the participant's own investment (warrants) or employment (staff options) and a holding period of at least three years. The programs are distinctly linked to the business strategy and thereby to the Company's long-term value creation  including its sustainability. For more information regarding these long-termshare-based incentive programs  see www.bico.com. Principles for various types of remuneration  etc The total remuneration to Executives shall be on market terms and may consist of the following components: fixed cash base salary  variable cash remuneration  pension benefits and other benefits. Additionally  the General Meeting may - irrespective of these guidelines - resolve on  among other things  share-related or share price-related remuneration. Fixed remuneration The fixed remuneration meaning cash base salary shall be determined with consideration of the Executive's individual area of responsibility  authority  competence  experience and performance. The fixed cash base salary shall be reviewed annually. Annual variable remuneration The satisfaction of criteria for awarding variable cash remuneration shall be possible to measure over a period of one year. The variable cash remuneration for the CEO may not amount to more than 100%  and for other members of the executive management 50%  of the total fixed annual cash base salary. An amount corresponding to 25% of the variable cash remuneration  received by the Executive  before deductions for income tax (i.e.  the gross amount) must be used to acquire shares in BICO. The shares that are acquired must  subject to certain customary exceptions  be kept for at least three years. The purpose of reserving part of the variable salary for the acquisition of shares in BICO is to increase the Executives' long-term commitment to the Company and thereby benefit its strategy and long-term value creation. Normally  the Executives' acquisition of BICO shares with the variable cash remuneration component must take place in May/June and then with the application of current rules on market abuse. Variable 7remuneration shall not be awarded  and can be reclaimed  if the Executives have acted contrary to BICO policies  instructions  and guidelines  and/or the Company's code of conduct. Further  the Company has the right to reclaim paid variable remuneration  if it has been calculated or paid out on incorrect grounds.

(NASDAQ:SMCI) and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) are also among the 10 unstoppable tech stocks to buy now.NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is making huge moves in AI and investors and analysts are bullish on the stock. Over the past 3 months  the stock has received 39 Buy ratings from Wall Street analysts. Its average price target of $989.5 represents an upside of 15% from current levels. As of April 5  the stock has returned over 215% over the past 12 months. Here is what Palm Valley Capital Fund said about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:Story continues“Such beguiling prognostications are indigenous to Wall Street—the biggest showcase of them all. The ferocious march higher of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s stock on expectations of its continued dominance in artificial intelligence (AI) chips might even confound the galley slavedriver in Ben-Hur. Ramming speed! Nvidia’s share price seems to imply the firm will soon control nearly the entire global semiconductor market (over half a trillion in sales vs. Nvidia’s current $60 billion) while maintaining an operating margin of 54%—unprecedented for a hardware company. Leading hardware firms rarely retain their supremacy forever: IBM  Hewlett Packard  Digital Equipment Corporation  Intel  and Cisco all fell from their storied perches…”Analysts are also bullish on Super Micro Computer  Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI). On March 25  Northland Capital Markets analyst Nehal Chokshi raised the price target on Super Micro Computer  Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) to $1 300 from $925 and maintained an Outperform rating. Over the past 3 months  the stock has received 7 Buy ratings from Wall Street analysts. Here is what ClearBridge Investments had to say about Super Micro Computer  Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:“While large cap benchmarks get a lot of attention for a handful of mega cap stocks driving the lion’s share of performance  we would highlight even more extreme and unprecedented concentration in small cap benchmarks. Year to date  one stock  Super Micro Computer  Inc.(NASDAQ:SMCI) has driven 37% of the return of the benchmark. Currently  SMCI is the largest constituent by weight in our benchmark  and it peaked at over 4.5%  representing the largest individual security weight in a monthly dataset going back to 1985. That represented a weighting 83% higher than the second-largest weight (from 1999). Moreover  MicroStrategy at its peak this past quarter would have represented the fourth-largest security in the 38 years of the monthly dataset. We are hard-pressed to recall another instance where the largest constituent of our benchmark was also added to the S&P 500  as SMCI was this March. We would note that SMCI currently is a $61 billion market capitalization company and MicroStrategy boasts a market capitalization of $28 billion  both well above the $6.8 billion weighted average market cap of the Strategy. Enthusiasm for AI and bitcoin have fueled this atypical concentration and performance distortion. Bitcoin rallied fast and furiously following the SEC’s approval of the first bitcoin ETF in early January  while the AI infrastructure build-out has had a narrow set of beneficiaries. Against this backdrop  the ClearBridge Small Cap Growth Strategy underperformed its benchmark. We are disappointed by this result  although 79% of the relative underperformance was due to not owning these two large benchmark holdings  which have fundamental and governance factors that have caused us  as long-term investors focused on quality sustainable growth stories  to avoid them.”You can also look at the 10 AI Stocks That Will Skyrocket and 11 Stocks That Will Profit From AI Evolution.European Stocks Tumble After Strong Q1On April 5  Reuters reported that the European market witnessed a significant decline after a strong first quarter  amid hawkish comments from a US Federal Reserve official  reversing the bullish sentiment that led to gains in the first quarter of 2024.On April 4  Minneapolis Fed President  Neel Kashkari appeared at a virtual LinkedIn event where he was asked about the expected rate cuts in 2024. The Federal Reserve official expressed his shock over the economy's resilience despite the rising interest rates. He further added that with significant growth in the job market  GDP  and consumer spending  we might not need to cut rates. He said:""Maybe the dynamics that we have right now are actually sustainable. But  you know  there are a lot of ifs underlying that question and that hypothesis or that scenario that I just articulated. So we need to see what ultimately happens with both the labor market and with inflation. Our dual mandate ultimately is what drives our rate path.""The idea floated by the Fed official doused hopes for interest rate cuts and led to the stumbling of European stocks on April 5. The STOXX Europe 600 (.STOXX) declined 1.2% and reached its lowest since mid-October 2023. Benchmark indices across the major European countries including DAX Performance Index  FTSE MIB Index (.FTMIB)  and IBEX 35 (.IBEX)  declined by over 1% each.The drop can also be attributed to the ongoing Middle East crisis. The increase in Brent crude prices and the suspicions regarding supply disruption  led to a 1.8% drop in the travel and leisure stocks  the STOXX 600 Travel & Leisure PR Index (.SXTP)  followed by a decline of around 1% and more in other indices and stocks.Increased Foreign Capital and Investments in Asian StocksThe impact of the Fed official's remarks about no rate cuts  led to major declines in the Asian stock market. However  the first quarter of 2024 presented a great outlook for the stock market in the region. On April 5  Reuters reported that Asian stocks surged in March  driven by the increased traction from foreign investors. The quarter was recorded as the best for foreign investments over the past three years  fueled by expectations of relaxed monetary policies and economic growth in the region  specifically China. According to the stock exchange data across India  South Korea  Indonesia  Taiwan  Philippines  Thailand  and Vietnam  foreign investors bought a total of $8.53 billion of regional equities in March. The total inflow for the quarter reached $18.57 billion  recording the highest investments since December 2020.Now that we have discussed the stock market outlook for 2024 and talked about the major markets  let's have a look at the 30 largest stock exchanges in the world.30 Largest Stock Exchanges in the WorldPhoto by Pascal Bernardon on UnsplashMethodologyTo compile our list of the 30 largest stock exchanges in the world  we utilized the World Federation of Exchanges (WFE) market statistics for stock exchanges.

As of the date of this Communication  the total number of exercisable voting rights  as resulting from the latest communication made by the Issuer pursuant to Article 85-bis  paragraph 4-bis  of the Issuers' Regulation  is no. 21 803 734. LEGAL REQUIREMENTS OF AND REASONS FOR THE OFFER Legal requirements of the Offer The Offer consists of a total voluntary tender offer promoted pursuant to and for the purposes of Article 102  paragraph 1  of the TUF and the relevant implementing provisions contained in the Issuers' Regulation. The Offer is subject to the fulfillment of the Conditions of the Offer (as defined below) set forth in Section 3.3 of this Communication. The decision to promote the Offer was taken today by resolution of the board of directors of the Offeror. 2.2. Reasons for the Offer 5Courtesy translation - for convenience only The Offer is aimed at acquiring the entirety of the Shares Subject to the Offer and  consequently  at achieving the Delisting. Therefore  upon the occurrence of the relevant prerequisites  the Offeror will not restore a sufficient free float to ensure the regular trading of SAES Shares. The Offeror  after the extraordinary transactions of SAES Getters that took place in 2023 and the significant downsizing of the business and in view of a generational transition  believes  also consistently with what the Issuer has communicated to the market  that an industrial reorganization of the Issuer is appropriate  an activity that is more easily pursued as an unlisted company  also in view of the timing and possible risks and complexities of such reorganization. Indeed  the Delisting would enable the Issuer to pursue its purposes in a context and legal framework characterized by greater managerial and organizational flexibility  with faster decision- making and performance times and also benefiting from a possible reduction in operating costs. Through the Offer  SAES Getters' shareholders are given the opportunity to monetize their investment at particularly advantageous terms  which are more favourable than those currently offered by the market and those provided by the Proposed Partial Tender Offer on Treasury Shares. The Consideration is also higher than the consideration for exiting the Offeror provided in favour of some historical shareholders of the Offeror following the success of the Offer  as better described in Section 1.2 above. The Offeror will also  upon completion of the Offer  resolve (and cause the Issuer to resolve) the Merger with the Issuer also in order to fully repay the Financing (as defined below) by using part of the Issuer's available resources. For more information about the Delisting  please refer to Section 3.6 of this Communication. 3. ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS OF THE OFFER 3.1 Categories and quantity of the Shares Subject to the Offer The Offer is promoted exclusively in Italy and concerns up to no. 11 731 762 SAES Shares  representing approximately 69.9% of SAES Getters' share capital and 53.8% of the voting rights exercisable at the Issuer's shareholders' meetings. The Shares Subject to the Offer correspond to the entirety of the Shares  less the Initial Holding  consisting of no. 5 053 486 Shares held by the Offeror  representing approximately 30.1% of the Issuer's share capital and approximately 46.2% of the voting rights exercisable at the Issuer's shareholders' meetings  taking into account the increased voting rights provided for in SAES Getters' by-laws pursuant to Article 127-quinquies of the TUF. Please note that the Shares Subject to Tender Commitment amount to no. 494 095 Shares  representing approximately 2.9% of the Issuer's share capital and approximately 4.2% of the Shares Subject to the Offer. The sum of the Initial Holding and the Shares Subject to Tender Commitment amounts to no. 5 547 581 Shares  representing approximately 33.1% of the Issuer's share capital. 6Courtesy translation - for convenience only Following the publication of this Communication  as well as during the Acceptance Period (as defined below)  as extended or reopened pursuant to applicable laws  the Offeror reserves the right to purchase Shares outside of the Offer  within the limits set forth by applicable laws. Such purchases will be communicated to the market in accordance with Article 41  paragraph 2(c) of the Issuers' Regulation. The number of Shares Subject to the Offer may be automatically reduced as a result of any purchases made by the Offeror and/or Persons Acting in Concert outside of the Offer. The Offer is addressed  indiscriminately and on equal terms  to all holders of Shares Subject to the Offer. The Shares tendered to the VTO must be freely transferable to the Offeror and free from constraints and encumbrances of every kind and nature  whether real  mandatory or personal. 3.2 Offered price per Share and total consideration of the Offer 3.2.1 Offered price per Share and its determination The Offeror will pay  on the Payment Date (as defined below)  the cash Consideration of Euro 26.3 (ex 2023 Dividend) for each of the Shares Subject to the Offer tendered to the VTO and purchased by the Offeror. The Consideration is net of stamp duty  registration tax and Italian financial transaction tax  if due  and fees  commissions and expenses that will be borne by the Offeror. Conversely  any income tax  withholding tax  or substitute tax  if due  on the income potentially realised  will be borne by the shareholders tendering the Shares to the Offer. Please note that the ordinary shareholders' meeting of SAES Getters convened for April 23  2024 for the approval of the financial statements as of December 31  2023  is also called to approve  among other things  the 2023 Dividend  equal to Euro 12.51 per Share  which will be paid on May 2  2024. The Consideration  therefore  is net of the amount per Share of the 2023 Dividend  on the assumption that the 2023 Dividend is approved by the ordinary shareholders' meeting of SAES Getters on April 23  2024  and is paid on May 2  2024.

This growth was driven by sales of premium ranges (especially VEOS - Distimp).Europe (58% of revenue) continued to grow  driven by sales of Distimp and Spine Innovations products  particularly in France. Quarterly revenue came to €1.8 million  compared with €1.4 million as of 2023 first quarter (up 28%)  demonstrating the continued strengthening of the Group’s sales in this area.Over the period  sales in Latin America (27% of total revenue) rose to €0.8 million from €0.3 million in the same period in 2023. This was driven by higher sales of the Spineway range and sales of Spine Innovations range in Mexico.The positive revenue trend for the first quarter of 2024 confirms Spineway’s ability to gain market share and grow in an increasingly demanding environment.

Tonner’s refocused strategy prioritizes: Maximizing the value of stakes in its holdings such as Doneclé and Elistair  broadening collaboration internally and externally  and bringing to market industry-changing products such as Countbot and Inhibitor.Tonner regularly receives inquiries from private companies about potential collaborations. While Tonner has long wanted to engage in actionable discussions with these companies  it was unable to do so until recently due to the company’s financial uncertainty. Following the capital increase  Tonner is now financially stable and embarking upon discussions with potential partners  targets  and collaborators.Tonner will carefully assess these opportunities with rigorous due diligence and stress-tests prior to formalizing any transactions. Candidates for consideration must be revenue generating  have exceptional management and technical teams  exhibit the potential to scale internationally  and add immediate synergistic value to Tonner.Tonner asks that its shareholders and investors recognize this fundamental repositioning as management develops this innovative organization. While Tonner is currently a smaller-cap organization  management sees an opportunity to increase the company’s market capitalization with this repositioning  particularly if Tonner can become a larger company in this fragmented industry. Leveraging its network across Europe and America  management is confident in this approach  and is priming the organization to evaluate numerous partnerships in the coming months. In case that an interesting RTO opportunity presented itself  TonnerDrones would also seriously consider this.“I would like to thank the historic shareholders and new investors in supporting our restructuring and strategic plans ” said Brad Taylor  CEO. “With cash reserves for the next twelve months  the company now has the stability and time to expand its business and intensify conversations with potential partners.”About Tonner Drones : Tonner Drones (formerly Delta Drone) develops UAVs and associated technologies for the defense and homeland security sectors.

First of all  the FDA's 510(k) certification of the customized version of our surgical planning software enabled us to receive a $3 million payment from our American partner  NuVasive. This demonstrates our expertise and paves the way for the upcoming release of a brand-new surgical planning platform incorporating artificial intelligence to model the spine and provide practitioners with an optimized simulation of the surgical outcomes to be achieved. In the second part of the year  we activated several major user centers of SMAIO solutions in the US  demonstrating the increasing adoption of our technology by surgeons and validating the relevance of the various training programs we have conducted in the US over the past months. Finally  we have strengthened our financial structure through non-dilutive funding of €2.5 million  providing us with the necessary resources to continue deploying our growth strategy focused on the North American market.""Full-year 2023 resultsSMAIO SASimplified income statement (SMAIO SA – parent Company - in €m) 2023 2022 Sales 7.6 2.4 Capitalized production 1.1 0.7 Operating income 8.9 3.2 Operating expenses (8.2) (7.2) Operating profit/(loss) 0.7 (4.0) Exceptional income/(expenses) - 6.6 Net profit/(loss) 1.1 2.8Taking into account intra-group sales of implants  which are strongly linked to the growth of SMAIO's U.S. subsidiary  SMAIO SA’s sales 2023 amounted to €7.6 million  up +212% compared to 2022. After neutralizing intra-group sales of implants between SMAIO SA and its U.S. subsidiary SMAIO USA and considering only the hospital implant sales conducted by the latter  SMAIO Group’s sales came to €5.4 million*  representing a +120% growth compared to 2022. Sales of the Kheiron system  consisting of customized implants and rods  were particularly strong in the last quarter of the year (+40% vs. Q4 2022) due to surgeries performed in the U.S.  initiated during the second half of 2023.Capitalized production reached €1.1 million compared with €0.7 million in 2022  reflecting SMAIO's R&D efforts and enabling to position the Company as a key differentiator in the spinal surgery sector.The margin on the purchase cost of implant sales has continued its upward trend  up from 63% in 2022 to 67% in 2023 (71% on a consolidated basis*). This trend is the direct result of the optimization of the Company's purchasing prices  coupled with the growth in international sales in high value-added markets. This margin should continue to increase significantly for SMAIO from 2024 with the ramp-up of the U.S. subsidiary  a market where margins have historically been higher.The increase in other operating expenses is the result of the efforts made by SMAIO in R&D  since its IPO in April 2022  with the strengthening of its software development teams integrating artificial intelligence (AI) and the promotion of its solutions through the ""Sagittal Alignment Academy"" training courses held in Europe and the United States.In view of the above  operating profit for 2023 stands at €0.7 million  compared with a loss of -€4.0 million in 2022.After considering a research tax credit of €0.4 million  net profit for 2023 stood at €1.1 million  compared with a profit of €2.8 million for the same period in 2022  which was the result of exceptional income following the cancellation of SMAIO's debts to its main shareholder  Sylorus Scientific  prior to the company's IPO.SMAIO Group (for information only)SMAIO does not exceed any of the 3 thresholds set by art. R233-17 of the French Commercial Code and did not produce consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31  2023. However  to provide accurate and comparable financial information  the Company is informing the public of the SMAIO Group's consolidated results after elimination of internal transactions and non-tax consolidation restatements.Simplified income statement (Consolidated statements - in €m) 2023 2022 Sales 5.4 2.4 of which France 1.1 1.1 of which US 0.3 - of which Rest of the World 1.2 1.3 of which milestone payment 2.8 - Operating profit/(loss) (1.1) (4.0) Exceptional income/(expenses) - 6.6 Net profit/(loss) (0.8) 2.8* Unaudited figuresThe SMAIO Group's operating result amounted to -€1.1 million  after restatement of sales of implants  instruments and services between the parent company SMAIO SA and its U.S. subsidiary SMAIO USA in order to give it the necessary resources to implement its strategy of entering the U.S. market  and after incorporating the margin on the purchase cost of implant sales to U.S. hospitals  at 91%.Solid financial structureThe cash position of SMAIO SA was €6.8 million at December 31  2023 (€6.9 million in consolidated statements* and €6.5 million after deduction of the portion of bank loans still to be repaid in 2024)  compared with €5.7 million at December 31  2022. This increase is due to a good control over cash burn levels  the milestone payment from NuVasive  and the receipt of a non-dilutive financing of €2.5 million in the form of a R&D loan from Bpifrance Innovation (€1 million  that includes a 3-year grace period) and two loans from a banking pool  including BNP Paribas and Société Générale (€1.5 million  4-year maturity).The equity of SMAIO SA stood at €10.8 million (€8.9 million in consolidated statements*) at Decembre 31  2023  compared with €9.8 million at December 31  2022.2023 highlightsFDA 510(k) clearance for customized version of surgical planning software co-developed with NuVasiveIn June 2023  SMAIO announced that it had obtained FDA 510(k) clearance for the customized version of its ""Balance Analyzer 3D"" surgical planning software  co-developed with NuVasive. The achievement of this first milestone  in line with the roadmap presented by SMAIO at the time of its IPO in April 2022  triggered the payment of $3 million by NuVasive to SMAIO. Following the acquisition of NuVasive by Globus Medical  a U.S. company specializing in spinal instruments and implants  SMAIO is continuing discussions with the latter on the next steps in the partnership  which includes an additional payment linked to the development of a future version of the Balance Analyzer 3D  the core technologies of which can be used by both companies. SMAIO will keep the market informed of the outcome of discussions with Globus Medical.Success of a new ""Sagittal Alignment Think Thank"" educational program in the United StatesAs a follow-up to the first four Sagittal Alignment Academy training programs for its European (Copenhagen  Madrid and Brussels in October 2022 and April 2023) and North American (Dallas in November 2022) customers  SMAIO has accelerated the dissemination of its holistic approach to spine surgery in the United States with the first Sagittal Alignment Think Tank in November 2023.SMAIO's goal is to develop a consensus with North American surgeons on a patient-specific method of spinal realignment  based on the extensive data in SMAIO's KEOPS database  from which it is developing several technologies using artificial intelligence2. These training courses provide an opportunity to understand how the i-kontrol platform can be used to accurately plan and perform spinal realignment surgery in daily practice.Strategy and outlookSMAIO is continuing to implement its strategic plan presented at the time of the IPO  and will continue to build its growth by investing its resources in 2 main areas:The development of highly innovative solutions based on the Kheiron system and the KEOPS Balance Analyzer 3D planning software  for its own use or through customized versions incorporating artificial intelligence.The development of its commercial activity in the United States via its complete i-kontrol package or its customized planning solutions using SMAIO's new AI platform  which is currently being rolled out  with the aim of reaching around ten i-kontrol surgeons and around forty users of the AI planning platform on a recurring basis by the end of 2025.Upcoming financial events:Annual General Meeting: June 18  2024June 18  2024 Sales for the first half of 2024: July 16  2024 (after market close)July 16  2024 (after market close) Half-year 2024 results: October 15  2024 (after market close)About SMAIOA precursor in the use of clinical data and imaging of the spine  SMAIO designs global solutions for spine surgery specialists.

When asked how GenAI could support decision making or improve interactions at the point-of-care:Four in five (81%) physicians say GenAI will improve care team interaction with patients.Over half believe GenAI will save them 20% or more time.Over two-thirds (68%) say it can save time by quickly searching medical literature.Three in five (59%) say it can save time by summarizing data about patients from the electronic health record (EHR).Only 3% do not believe GenAI will improve interactions with patients.Doctors and patients diverge on GenAI in careComparing results of this survey with a Wolters Kluwer survey of U.S. consumers conducted in late 2023 shows that consumers have different views on the integration of GenAI into the physician/patient interaction. Two-thirds of physicians say that patients would be confident in GenAI results to make clinical decisions while just over half of patients report they would be confident. When physicians were asked if they believe patients would be concerned about the use of GenAI in a diagnosis  only one out of five physicians said yes. Conversely  when asked directly  four out of five Americans reported they would be concerned  suggesting a wide gap in perceptions about GenAI readiness among health consumers.Doctors set high transparency and content source standards for GenAI guidelinesPhysicians’ responses reflect a landscape that is still developing clear guidance or policies on using GenAI. Over a third (37%) say there are currently no guidelines in place at their organizations about using GenAI while almost half (46%) say they don’t know of any guidelines.Still  physicians have concerns about the source of content and want transparency. For the majority of physicians (58%)  the number one most important factor when selecting a GenAI tool is knowing the content it is trained on was created by medical professionals.Nine out 10 (89%) report they would be more likely to use GenAI in clinical decisions if the vendor was transparent about where the information came from  who created it  and how it was resourced. Knowing that the technology is from a well-known  trusted company was also a priority: 76% would be more comfortable using GenAI knowing it came from established vendors in the healthcare sector.A responsible approach to Clinical GenAIWolters Kluwer Health recently expanded the beta of AI Labs  its collaborative solution to explore the experimental use of Clinical GenAI  to 100 U.S. hospitals.

Nearly half (49.6%) of all internet traffic came from bots in 2023—a 2% increase over the previous year  and the highest level Imperva has reported since it began monitoring automated traffic in 2013.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240416225637/en/©ThalesFor the fifth consecutive year  the proportion of web traffic associated with bad bots grew to 32% in 2023  up from 30.2% in 2022  while traffic from human users decreased to 50.4%. Automated traffic is costing organizations billions (USD) annually due to attacks on websites  APIs  and applications.“Bots are one of the most pervasive and growing threats facing every industry ” says Nanhi Singh  General Manager  Application Security at Imperva  a Thales company. “From simple web scraping to malicious account takeover  spam  and denial of service  bots negatively impact an organization’s bottom line by degrading online services and requiring more investment in infrastructure and customer support. Organizations must proactively address the threat of bad bots as attackers sharpen their focus on API-related abuses that can lead to account compromise or data exfiltration.”Key trends identified in the 2024 Imperva Bad Bot Report include:Global average of bad bot traffic reached 32%: Ireland (71%)  Germany (67.5%)  and Mexico (42.8%)  saw the highest levels of bad bot traffic in 2023. The US also saw a slightly higher ratio of bad bot traffic at 35.4% compared to 2022 (32.1%).Growing use of generative AI connected to the rise in simple bots: Rapid adoption of generative AI and large language models (LLMs) resulted in the volume of simple bots increasing to 39.6% in 2023  up from 33.4% in 2022. The technology uses web scraping bots and automated crawlers to feed training models  while enabling nontechnical users to write automated scripts for their own use.Account takeover is a persistent business risk: Account takeover (ATO) attacks increased 10% in 2023  compared to the same period in the prior year. Notably  44% of all ATO attacks targeted API endpoints  compared to 35% in 2022. Of all login attempts across the internet  11% were associated with account takeover. The industries that saw the highest volume of ATO attacks in 2023 were Financial Services (36.8%)  Travel (11.5%)  and Business Services (8%).APIs are a popular vector for attack: Automated threats caused a significant 30% of API attacks in 2023. Among them  17% were bad bots exploiting business logic vulnerabilities—a flaw within the API’s design and implementation that allows attackers to manipulate legitimate functionality and gain access to sensitive data or user accounts. Cybercriminals use automated bots to find and exploit APIs  which act as a direct pathway to sensitive data  making them a prime target for business logic abuse.Every industry has a bot problem: For a second consecutive year  Gaming (57.2%) saw the largest proportion of bad bot traffic. Meanwhile  Retail (24.4%)  Travel (20.7%)  and Financial Services (15.7%) experienced the highest volume of bot attacks. The proportion of advanced bad bots  those that closely mimic human behavior and evade defenses  was highest on Law & Government (75.8%)  Entertainment (70.8%)  and Financial Services (67.1%) websites.Bad bot traffic originating from residential ISPs grows to 25.8%: Early bad bot evasion techniques relied on masquerading as a user agent (browser) commonly used by legitimate human users. Bad bots masquerading as mobile user agents accounted for 44.8% of all bad bot traffic in the past year  up from 28.1% just five years ago. Sophisticated actors combine mobile user agents with the use of residential or mobile ISPs. Residential proxies allow bot operators to evade detection by making it appear as if the origin of the traffic is a legitimate  ISP-assigned residential IP address.“Automated bots will soon surpass the proportion of internet traffic coming from humans  changing the way that organizations approach building and protecting their websites and applications ” continued Singh. “As more AI-enabled tools are introduced  bots will become omnipresent. Organizations must invest in bot management and API security tools to manage the threat from malicious  automated traffic.”Additional Information:Download a copy of the 2024 Imperva Bad Bot Report for additional insights.a copy of the 2024 Imperva Bad Bot Report for additional insights.

The findings reflect a rapid acceptance of the new technology more broadly  with 68% saying they have changed their views over the last year  and are now more likely to think that GenAI would be beneficial to healthcare.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240416378499/en/Generative AI (GenAI) in healthcare: Growing physician enthusiasm. A survey commissioned by Wolters Kluwer Health found 40% of U.S. physicians would be comfortable using generative AI (GenAI) in interactions with patients at the point of care by the end of 2024. (Graphic: Business Wire)Physicians  however  are wary of which GenAI tools they would be comfortable using  with 91% of respondents saying they need to know the GenAI sourced materials were created by doctors and medical experts before using it in clinical decisions. Similarly  89% report they need vendors to be transparent about where information came from  who created it  and how it was sourced.Physicians are open to using generative AI in a clinical setting provided that applications are useful and trustworthy  said Dr. Peter Bonis  Chief Medical Officer  Wolters Kluwer Health. The source of content and transparency are key considerations.Transformative tech: GenAI viewed as helping to save time and optimize care teamsWith healthcare facing challenges with staffing shortages and burnout  physicians see many benefits to applying GenAI in the care continuum. When asked how GenAI could support decision making or improve interactions at the point-of-care:Four in five (81%) physicians say GenAI will improve care team interaction with patients.Over half believe GenAI will save them 20% or more time.Over two-thirds (68%) say it can save time by quickly searching medical literature.Three in five (59%) say it can save time by summarizing data about patients from the electronic health record (EHR).Only 3% do not believe GenAI will improve interactions with patients.Doctors and patients diverge on GenAI in careComparing results of this survey with a Wolters Kluwer survey of U.S. consumers conducted in late 2023 shows that consumers have different views on the integration of GenAI into the physician/patient interaction. Two-thirds of physicians say that patients would be confident in GenAI results to make clinical decisions while just over half of patients report they would be confident. When physicians were asked if they believe patients would be concerned about the use of GenAI in a diagnosis  only one out of five physicians said yes. Conversely  when asked directly  four out of five Americans reported they would be concerned  suggesting a wide gap in perceptions about GenAI readiness among health consumers.Doctors set high transparency and content source standards for GenAI guidelinesPhysicians' responses reflect a landscape that is still developing clear guidance or policies on using GenAI. Over a third (37%) say there are currently no guidelines in place at their organizations about using GenAI while almost half (46%) say they don't know of any guidelines.Still  physicians have concerns about the source of content and want transparency. For the majority of physicians (58%)  the number one most important factor when selecting a GenAI tool is knowing the content it is trained on was created by medical professionals.Nine out 10 (89%) report they would be more likely to use GenAI in clinical decisions if the vendor was transparent about where the information came from  who created it  and how it was resourced. Knowing that the technology is from a well-known  trusted company was also a priority: 76% would be more comfortable using GenAI knowing it came from established vendors in the healthcare sector.A responsible approach to Clinical GenAIWolters Kluwer Health recently expanded the beta of AI Labs  its collaborative solution to explore the experimental use of Clinical GenAI  to 100 U.S. hospitals.

TURNOVER FOR FIRST QUARTER 2024 DOWN -17.2%  ...https://www.marketscreener.…,"BUSINESSA number of factors lie behind the 17.2% fall in quarterly turnover:The business of subsidiaries involved in the energy renovation of buildings is at a low ebb  as a result of the delay in implementing the new organisation for awarding subsidies under the MaPrimeRénov' scheme.scheme. The heavy rainfall at the start of the year detrimentally affected our watering pump sales.Turnover for the first quarter of 2023 was 10.3% up on the same period in 2022  making comparisons more difficult  especially as the 2024 calendar has one business day fewer.The French market for new homes is at an all-time low. The DIY and swimming pool markets continue to decline.all-time low. The DIY and swimming pool markets continue to decline. The 9.6% rise in prices over the first three months of 2023 has reversed much more quickly than expected  and we are witnessing an average fall of 1.9% in our prices to the end of March 2024.On a positive note  sales in the industrial and water cycle sectors - and in international markets generally - are holding up well.PROSPECTSIn response to the drastic fall in the number of energy renovation projects in buildings since the start of the year  the public authorities have relaxed the new rules for awarding MaPrimeRénov' grants. Two decrees to this effect were published on March 22  2024 and will apply from May 15. We believe that these measures could quickly have a positive effect on the product ranges concerned. We are therefore reiterating our more optimistic business forecast for the second half of the year  and remain quietly confident for the medium term. We can rely on our decentralised organisation to give our teams the freedom to be commercially aggressive  control costs and manage working capital requirements. Consequently  our consolidated cash position has grown from €35m to €45m since 31/12/2023.In the water cycle sphere  our subsidiary Jetly is a contributor to the work of the French rainwater industries federation (IFEP) to raise awareness among public authorities as to the benefits of reusing non-drinking water. For example  we are promoting the use of rainwater for toilets and the re-use of treated wastewater for the watering of green spaces. Widespread use of this kind would not only result in substantial short-term savings in drinking water  but would also boost sales of some of our technical solutions.""PHYGITAL"" COMBINED GENERAL MEETING OF APRIL 2  2024Our Annual General Meeting was held in Lyon on April 2  2024. It was attended by 215 people  40 remote shareholders and 1 239 voters representing 77.11% of voting rights  compared with 76.29% in 2023. A new record was thereby set  thanks to your commitment and the widespread use of Votaccess.All the resolutions were passed with approval rates of between 89% and 100%. The texts of the resolutions can be found on pages 193 to 197 of our 2023 Universal Registration Document  and on our website. As a result  a dividend of €2.08 per share was detached on April 12 and paid on April 16. As in previous years  the entire AGMwas filmed and posted on the Thermador Groupe YouTube channel.Resolutions 17 and 18 allowing the allocation of free shares to our employees and directors were approved by 95.6% and 89.7% respectively. We thank you for your trust in these matters. However  the lukewarm support of our teams for this project will undoubtedly lead us not to use the possibility you have given us  and to propose a more consensual solution at a later date.Board of directorsPhilippe Bories (CEO of Mecafer) and Jérôme Chabaudie (CEO of Aello) have reached the end of their two-year terms as directors. We would like to thank them for their contribution.To replace them  Frank Bourgois (CEO of Jetly) has been appointed director for a one-year term. At the same time  we informed you that Peter Wartel (CEO of Sodeco) would regularly attend Board meetings over a period of one year. In 2025  we will be proposing that they switch roles. In this way  they will both be able to participate in the work of the Board of Directors for two years  exercising only one vote if necessary. By doing this  we can meet the wishes of investors  with independent directors holding the majority of seats.Furthermore  we informed you that Patricia Mavigner  who is also Secretary to the Board of Directors  has been reappointed as Deputy CEO for a further 4 years.PEA PMEThermador Groupe has confirmed its eligibility with Euronext.Yours faithfully The ChairmanGuillaume Robin",neutral,0.02,0.98,0.0,mixed,0.53,0.2,0.27,True,English,"['2024 1st quarter turnover', 'Thermador Groupe', 'Publication', 'Jérôme Chabaudie', 'Thermador Groupe YouTube channel', 'French rainwater industries federation', 'working capital requirements', 'consolidated cash position', 'substantial short-term savings', '2023 Universal Registration Document', 'swimming pool markets', 'first three months', 'water cycle sectors', 'water cycle sphere', 'energy renovation projects', 'optimistic business forecast', 'Annual General Meeting', 'one business day', ""MaPrimeRénov' scheme"", 'watering pump sales', 'French market', 'international markets', 'first quarter', 'drinking water', 'one vote', 'low ebb', 'new organisation', 'heavy rainfall', 'new homes', 'positive note', 'public authorities', 'new rules', 'Two decrees', 'product ranges', 'second half', 'medium term', 'decentralised organisation', 'green spaces', 'technical solutions', 'PHYGITAL"" COMBINED', '40 remote shareholders', 'voting rights', 'new record', 'approval rates', 'entire AGMwas', 'free shares', 'lukewarm support', 'consensual solution', 'later date', 'Philippe Bories', 'two-year terms', 'Frank Bourgois', 'one-year term', 'same time', 'Peter Wartel', 'Patricia Mavigner', 'PEA PME', 'The Chairman', 'Guillaume Robin', 'average fall', 'drastic fall', 'previous years', 'two years', 'one year', 'quarterly turnover', 'same period', 'positive effect', 'Widespread use', 'Board meetings', 'Deputy CEO', 'independent directors', '17.2% fall', '4 years', 'number', 'factors', 'subsidiaries', 'buildings', 'result', 'delay', 'subsidies', 'start', 'comparisons', '2024 calendar', 'DIY', '9.6% rise', 'prices', 'March', 'industrial', 'PROSPECTS', 'response', 'grants', 'May', 'measures', 'teams', 'freedom', 'costs', '31/12', 'subsidiary', 'Jetly', 'contributor', 'IFEP', 'awareness', 'benefits', 'example', 'toilets', 'wastewater', 'kind', 'APRIL', 'Lyon', '215 people', '1,239 voters', 'commitment', 'Votaccess', 'resolutions', 'texts', 'pages', 'website', 'dividend', 'allocation', 'employees', 'trust', 'matters', 'possibility', 'Mecafer', 'Aello', 'contribution', 'Sodeco', 'roles', 'way', 'wishes', 'investors', 'majority', 'seats', 'Secretary', 'eligibility', 'Euronext', '76']",2024-01-17,2024-04-17,marketscreener.com

We anticipate potential growth catalysts both in 2024 and 2025 ” said Carlos de Sousa  CEO at Ultimovacs. “Our objective is to create value for both patients and our shareholders while safeguarding the financial stability of the company. Aligning with this goal requires us to reduce the level of activity and make prioritization adjustments  including reducing our workforce. I wish to thank the departing employees for their incredible dedication to helping cancer patients and for their contribution to our mission.”The operational adjustments enable an extension of the financial runway to the fourth quarter of 2025  beyond the anticipated topline readout from the Phase II DOVACC trial. Based on current plans and forecasts  the cash burn rate is estimated to be approximately NOK 15 million per quarter towards the end of 2025  prior to the initiation of potential new activities towards new clinical trials or other projects.The company will host a webcast presentation and provide a business update on Wednesday  April 17  2024  at 11:00 (CET). The presentation is attached.Link to webcast: https://channel.royalcast.com/landingpage/hegnarmedia/20240417_1/==ENDS==About UltimovacsUltimovacs is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing immunotherapeutic cancer vaccines. The lead cancer vaccine candidate UV1 is an off-the-shelf vaccine directed against human telomerase (hTERT)  an antigen present in 85-90% of cancers in all stages of tumor growth. A broad clinical program  with Phase II trials in five cancer indications enrolling more than 670 patients  aims to investigate UV1’s impact in combination with other immunotherapies in multiple cancer types. UV1 is a patented technology owned by Ultimovacs. In addition  Ultimovacs’ adjuvant platform  based on the proprietary Tetanus-Epitope-Targeting (TET) technology  combines tumor-specific antigens and adjuvant in the same molecule and is in Phase I clinical development.The Company is listed on the Euronext Oslo Stock Exchange (ULTI).About the UV1 Phase II programThe immunotherapeutic cancer vaccine UV1 is investigated in combination with checkpoint inhibitors in patients with various cancer indications with diverse tumor biology. The clinical strategy behind the UV1 Phase II program’s diversity is to evaluate the potential broad applicability of the cancer vaccine when combined with other immunotherapies:INITIUM: Evaluating UV1 in combination with ipilimumab and nivolumab as first-line treatment for patients with malignant melanoma. Enrollment of 156 patients completed in July 2022. Sponsored by Ultimovacs. With the 18-month minimum follow-up of the patients in the INITIUM trial  the trial did not meet the primary or secondary endpoints. Median PFS was not reached in either arm. UV1 maintained its beneficial safety profile.NIPU: Evaluating UV1 in combination with ipilimumab and nivolumab as second-line treatment for patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma. Enrollment of 118 patients completed in January 2023. Data presented at the ESMO Congress in October 2023 showed that UV1  as an add-on to ipilimumab and nivolumab  demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in overall survival versus ipilimumab and nivolumab alone. 31% of the patients receiving the UV1 vaccine experienced an objective response  compared to 16% in the control arm. The investigator-initiated study is led by Oslo University Hospital and supported by Bristol-Myers Squibb and Ultimovacs.FOCUS: Evaluating UV1 in combination with pembrolizumab as first-line treatment for patients with head and neck cancer. Enrollment of 75 patients completed in August 2023  expected readout Q3 2024. The investigator-initiated study is led by Halle University in Germany  supported by Ultimovacs.DOVACC : Evaluating UV1 in combination with olaparib and durvalumab as maintenance therapy in non-BRCA mutated patients with advanced ovarian cancer. 75 of 184 patients enrolled as of Q4 2023 reporting  expected readout H1 2025. The investigator-initiated study is led by NSGO-CTU and supported by ENGOT  AstraZeneca  and Ultimovacs.: Evaluating UV1 in combination with olaparib and durvalumab as maintenance therapy in non-BRCA mutated patients with advanced ovarian cancer. 75 of 184 patients enrolled as of Q4 2023 reporting  expected readout H1 2025. The investigator-initiated study is led by NSGO-CTU and supported by ENGOT  AstraZeneca  and Ultimovacs. LUNGVAC: Evaluating UV1 combined with cemiplimab as first-line treatment of non-small cell lung cancer patients. 23 of 138 patients enrolled as of Q4 2023 reporting  expected readout H1 2026. The investigator-initiated study is led by Vestre Viken (Drammen Hospital) and supported by Ultimovacs.About UV1UV1 is a universal cancer vaccine designed to induce a specific T-cell response against telomerase. UV1 consists of long  synthetic peptides representing a sequence in the reverse transcriptase subunit of telomerase (hTERT)  shown to induce CD4+ T-cells. These CD4+ T-cells have the potential to provide inflammatory signals  and T-cell support is believed to be critical for triggering a strong anti-tumor immune response. Following intradermal injection  antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in the skin are exposed to the vaccine peptides. These APCs will process the peptides and present vaccine epitopes on Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) molecules to naïve T-cells in the lymph nodes. Activated vaccine-specific T-cells will then enter the circulation and search for cells displaying their cognate antigen in the context of HLA molecules.The UV1 peptides contain several epitopes  shown to be non-restrictive in terms of (HLA) alleles for presentation. It is  therefore  not required to perform HLA pre-screening of patients  which potentially enables broad population utilization of the vaccine. UV1 is administered over three months as eight intradermal injections together with the immune-modulator GM-CSF.For further information  please contact:Carlos de Sousa  CEOEmail: carlos.desousa@ultimovacs.comPhone: +47 908 92507Anne Worsøe  Head of Investor RelationsEmail: anne.worsoe@ultimovacs.comPhone: +47 90686815This information is considered inside information pursuant to the EU Market Abuse Regulation and is subject to the disclosure requirements pursuant to Section 5-12 in the Norwegian Securities Trading Act.This stock exchange announcement was published by Anne Worsøe  Head of Investor Relations at Ultimovacs ASA  on April 16  2024  at 22:10 CET.Attachment,neutral,0.02,0.98,0.01,positive,0.97,0.03,0.01,True,English,"['UV1 Vaccine Phase II Program', 'Operational Adjustments', 'Continuous Advancement', 'Ultimovacs', 'proprietary Tetanus-Epitope-Targeting (TET) technology', 'Euronext Oslo Stock Exchange', 'Phase I clinical development', 'next important data points', 'lead cancer vaccine candidate', 'UV1 Phase II program', 'Phase II DOVACC trial', 'immunotherapeutic cancer vaccine UV1', 'Phase II trials', 'broad clinical program', 'immunotherapeutic cancer vaccines', 'Carlos de Sousa', 'new clinical trials', '18-month minimum follow-up', 'beneficial safety profile', 'several cancer indications', 'five cancer indications', 'multiple cancer types', 'various cancer indications', 'advanced ovarian cancer', 'cash burn rate', 'diverse tumor biology', 'malignant pleural mesothelioma', 'potential new activities', 'Oslo University Hospital', 'potential growth catalysts', 'potential broad applicability', 'long-term business growth', 'previous UV1 trials', 'clinical-stage biotechnology company', 'operational adjustment plan', 'BRCA mutated patients', 'Activity level adjustments', 'Ultimovacs’ adjuvant platform', 'tumor growth', 'patented technology', 'clinical strategy', 'neck cancer', 'operational adjustments', 'shelf vaccine', 'UV1 vaccine', 'cash runway', 'malignant melanoma', 'Halle University', 'operational prioritization', 'business operations', 'prioritization adjustments', 'business update', 'DOVACC results', 'broad diversity', 'cancer patients', 'encouraging results', 'financial runway', 'continuous advancement', 'immunotherapy combinations', 'financial stability', 'departing employees', 'incredible dedication', 'current plans', 'other projects', 'human telomerase', 'other immunotherapies', 'tumor-specific antigens', 'same molecule', 'checkpoint inhibitors', 'first-line treatment', 'secondary endpoints', 'Median PFS', 'second-line treatment', 'ESMO Congress', 'meaningful improvement', 'overall survival', 'investigator-initiated study', 'Bristol-Myers Squibb', 'maintenance therapy', 'potential impact', 'The Company', 'INITIUM trial', 'fourth quarter', 'workforce reduction', 'OSE ULTI', 'objective response', 'control arm', 'topline readout', 'Ultimovacs ASA', 'webcast presentation', '670 patients', '156 patients', '118 patients', '75 patients', 'FOCUS', 'Q3', 'H1', 'investigation', 'challenges', 'accomplishments', 'CEO', 'value', 'shareholders', 'goal', 'contribution', 'mission', 'extension', 'forecasts', 'initiation', 'Wednesday', 'April', 'Link', 'royalcast', 'landingpage', 'hegnarmedia', 'ENDS', 'hTERT', 'cancers', 'stages', 'addition', 'ipilimumab', 'nivolumab', 'Enrollment', 'July', 'primary', 'NIPU', 'January', 'October', 'significant', 'pembrolizumab', 'head', 'August', 'Germany', 'olaparib', 'durvalumab', '184 pat', '2024', '11:00']",2024-04-16,2024-04-17,globenewswire.com

This quarter's commercial successes  particularly in the United States with global leaders in their field  fully validate our strategy to cement our leader position in artificial intelligence by hiring the best-in-class talent to grow our priority customer base of multinationals.Sidetrade delivered first quarter revenue in line with that of the 2023 fiscal year  posting 20% growth in revenue and subscriptions alike. These double-digit figures are driven both by the United States (+40%) and an increase in our subscription revenues with companies generating $1 billion-plus revenue (+24%). Looking at previous quarterly performance in 2023  we know that Q1 bookings have the greatest impact on revenue for the current year. Against this backdrop  now more than ever  we are confident we will achieve double-digit revenue growth for the fiscal year 2024.""Robust growth in bookings: ACV up 117%Sidetrade(€m) Q1 2024 Q1 2023 Change New SaaS subscriptions (New ARR) 1.85 0.89 +108% Services bookings 2.13 0.94 +127% New Annual Contract Value (ACV) 3.98 1.83 +117%2024 information is from consolidated  unaudited data.In Q1 2024  Sidetrade posted an outstanding performance  more than doubling its bookings. Over the period  the Group added €3.98 million in New Annual Contract Value (ACV) versus €1.83 million in Q1 2023  representing an increase of 117%. First-quarter bookings came in close to the Company’s all-time quarterly record - achieved in Q2 2023 - with €4.1 million in ACV.For the third consecutive quarter  the United States acted as a key growth driver  accounting for 60% of total bookings. In the first quarter of 2024  Sidetrade notably secured two major contracts in North America. The first of these was signed with a globally recognized player in hygiene  food safety and public healthcare  with revenue of $15 billion and a listing on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). This new customer will run wide-scale implementation of Sidetrade's e-invoicing solution  directly integrating its invoices in the information systems of their main customers in the United States. A key factor in this decision was the ability of Sidetrade's solution to process work orders and complex invoices within digital portals utilized by major buyers. This contract represents the most significant transaction for Sidetrade's e-invoicing solution  as a result of the Amalto acquisition (see press release of April 12  2021 ). The second major contract was agreed with the largest professional equipment rental provider the world over  posting revenue of $14 billion and listed on the NYSE. After being the main customer for a competing vendor  this giant chose Sidetrade because of its technological edge in AI  in addition to the excellence of its teams.New SaaS bookings (New ARR) totaled €1.85 million  up 108% from the same period in the 2023 fiscal year. In Q1 2024  Total Contract Value (TCV) increased to €6.49 million compared to €2.78 million in the same period  in the 2023 fiscal year  representing a surge of 134%. Parallel to this  services bookings  with almost all invoiced within twelve months of their signing  totaled €2.13 million  up 127% versus Q1 2023 (€0.94 million). This strong increase is mainly due to the growing number of deployment projects signed worldwide  as illustrated by the two new above mentioned American customers.Overall  the first-quarter 2024 performance reflects the upward trend in bookings observed during the 2023 fiscal year  further validating the relevance of the Company's strategic decisions  namely: 1/ a business strategy kick-started twenty-four months ago  with a focus on companies generating $1 billion-plus revenue  2/ an increased recognition by multinationals of Sidetrade's technological edge in AI  particularly in the United States  and 3/ the development of a comprehensive Order-to-Cash software suite  resulting from a strategy of continuous innovation.Strong revenue increase of 20%  with SaaS subscriptions up 20%Sidetrade(€m) Q1 2024 Q1 2023 Change 'Order-to-Cash' SaaS subscriptions 9.6 8.0 +20% Revenue 11.8 9.8 +20%2024 information is from consolidated  unaudited data. Reported basisIn Q1 2024  Sidetrade reported strong growth in revenue for 'Order-to-Cash' SaaS subscriptions  up 20%.The Company's revenue for the first quarter of 2024 totaled €11.8 million  also reporting an increase of 20%.On a Group-wide basis  this double-digit growth is attributable to:Robust revenue growth in the United States  up 40%Quarter after quarter  the United States is a growth driver for Sidetrade  posting revenues up 40% to €3.6 million in Q1 2024. Successful US expansion has meant that  for the first time  international markets account for 60% of the Company’s total revenue  with 31% coming from North America. Going forward  the United States will continue to be pivotal for Sidetrade's growth.Ever-increasing demand from multinational corporationsAnalysis of customer profiles for 'Order-to-Cash' activities is underpinned by growth of 24% in subscriptions with multinational corporations on annual recurring revenue (ARR) contracts in excess of €250 000. These subscriptions now account for 45% of Sidetrade's total subscriptions and are expected to remain an important growth driver in the quarters ahead.Consolidation of CreditPoint Software businessEffective July 1  2023  the consolidation of the CreditPoint Software business has positively contributed to Sidetrade's performance. In Q1 2024  CreditPoint generated revenue of €0.45 million  with a 4% impact on quarterly growth.It should be noted that all multi-year Sidetrade contracts are routinely indexed to inflation (the Syntec for Southern Europe  the UK CPI for Northern Europe and the US CPI for the United States). This measure alters the total price of SaaS subscriptions each year by reference to changes in these price indices  without anticipating contract renewals.Double-digit growth in sales confirmed for 2024Sidetrade looks ahead to the fiscal year 2024 with confidence and a clear vision and has the resources to fulfill its ambitions.Next financial announcementAnnual Shareholder General Meeting: June 20  2024  from 11:00 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. (France  Sidetrade headquarters)First Half Year Revenue for 2024: July 16  2024  after the stock market closes.Investor & Media relationsChristelle Dhrif 00 33 6 10 46 72 00 cdhrif@sidetrade.comAbout Sidetrade ( www.sidetrade.com )Sidetrade (Euronext Growth: ALBFR.PA) provides a SaaS platform dedicated to securing and accelerating cash flow.

The gMG and CIDP data presented at AAN reinforce that our pioneering approach to transforming autoimmunity is redefining what is possible for patients and their communities.Patients with CIDP face a number of diagnostic and treatment challenges said Jeffrey Allen  M.D.  Professor  Department of Neurology  University of Minnesota and Principal Investigator in the ADHERE trial. The results of the ADHERE trial show that VYVGART Hytrulo reduces the risk of clinical deterioration in patients with CIDP while minimizing side effects and reducing the treatment burden. These findings enhance our understanding of the role that IgG autoantibodies are likely to play in the disease  and open the door to new safe  effective and well-tolerated treatments that eliminate pathogenic IgGs.ADHERE Plenary Session (PL5) Highlights Rapid  Deep and Clinically Meaningful  and Durable Functional Improvements in CIDPIn the ADHERE study  a majority of patients treated with VYVGART Hytrulo  regardless of prior treatment  demonstrated evidence of rapid clinical improvement  and a reduced risk of relapse compared to those treated with placebo. As previously reported  ADHERE met its primary endpoint (p=0.000039) demonstrating a 61% reduction (HR: 0.39 95% CI: 0.25; 0.61) in the risk of relapse versus placebo. VYVGART Hytrulo was well-tolerated  and the observed safety and tolerability profile was consistent with previous clinical trials.Evidence of rapid onset and maintenance of clinical response: In the open-label Stage A of the ADHERE study  67% of patients treated with VYVGART Hytrulo demonstrated evidence of clinical improvement (ECI)  including 40% who had achieved ECI by the earliest possible measure at week 4. In Stage B  VYVGART Hytrulo-treated patients maintained a clinical response to treatment longer than those on placebo as evidenced by a statistically significant and clinically relevant reduction in risk of relapse. Results across both Stage A and B indicate IgG autoantibodies play a significant role in mediating the underlying biology of CIDP.In the open-label Stage A of the ADHERE study  67% of patients treated with VYVGART Hytrulo demonstrated evidence of clinical improvement (ECI)  including 40% who had achieved ECI by the earliest possible measure at week 4.

FDA decision on CIDP sBLA expected by June 21  2024: Data from the ADHERE trial were submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as part of a supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for VYVGART Hytrulo for the treatment of CIDP. The application was accepted for Priority Review in February 2024 and has been granted a PDUFA target action date of June 21  2024.AAN presentations highlight rapid  deep  and sustained improvements in gMG with ability to reduce steroid burdenClinical trial data and real-world evidence presented during AAN continue to highlight the differentiated efficacy and safety profile of VYVGART and VYVGART Hytrulo  driving rapid  deep  and sustained improvement across disease scales and with different dosing schedules  including the ability for patients to achieve minimal symptom expression (MSE).MSE results in ADAPT/ADAPT+: Poster Session 10ADAPT-SC+ interim results: Poster Session 10ADAPT-NXT interim results: Poster Session 10Cost-benefit analysis of efgartigimod to IVIG in Canada: Poster Session 4Side effects from long-term steroid use continue to be a significant burden associated with autoimmune disease  reinforcing the importance of the favorable safety profile of VYVGART. New data presented in an oral presentation (Scientific Platform Session 38) during AAN characterize how VVYGART treatment can significantly reduce concomitant steroid use.A substantial proportion of gMG patients (46%) were able to reduce steroid use over the first six months of initiating VYVGART treatment  including 34% of patients who tapered to <5mg/day and 18% who reduced completely to zero.Overview of efgartigimod safety profile across indications: Poster Session 4Analysis of serious infections and malignancies in MG: Poster Session 10About ADHERE Trial DesignThe ADHERE trial was a multicenter  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial evaluating VYVGART ® Hytrulo (efgartigimod alfa and hyaluronidase-qvfc) for the treatment of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). ADHERE enrolled 322 adult patients with CIDP who were treatment naÃ¯ve (not on active treatment within the past six months or newly diagnosed) or being treated with immunoglobulin therapy or corticosteroids. The trial consisted of an open-label Stage A followed by a randomized  placebo-controlled Stage B. In order to be eligible for the trial  the diagnosis of CIDP was confirmed by an independent panel of experts. Patients entered a run-in stage  where any ongoing CIDP treatment was stopped and in order to be eligible for Stage A had to demonstrate active disease  with clinically meaningful worsening on at least one CIDP clinical assessment tool  including INCAT  I-RODS  or mean grip strength. Treatment naÃ¯ve patients were able to skip the run-in period with proof of recent worsening. To advance to Stage B  patients needed to demonstrate evidence of clinical improvement (ECI) with VYVGART Hytrulo. ECI was achieved through improvement of the INCAT score  or improvement on I-RODS or mean grip strength if those scales had demonstrated worsening during the run-in period. In Stage B  patients were randomized to either VYVGART Hytrulo or placebo for up to 48 weeks. The primary endpoint was measured once 88 total relapses or events were achieved in Stage B and was based on the hazard ratio for the time to first adjusted INCAT deterioration (i.e. relapse). After Stage B  all patients had the option to roll-over to an open-label extension study to receive VYVGART Hytrulo.See Important Safety Information below  full United States Prescribing Information for VYVGART and full Prescribing Information for VYVGART Hytrulo for additional information.What is VYVGART ® (efgartigimod alfa-fcab) for intravenous (IV) infusion and what is VYVGART ® HYTRULO (efgartigimod alfa and hyaluronidase-qvfc) for subcutaneous injection?

Approximately 85% of people with MG progress to gMG within 24 months 1 where muscles throughout the body may be affected. Patients with confirmed AChR antibodies account for approximately 85% of the total gMG population.About Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP)Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) is a rare and serious autoimmune disease of the peripheral nervous system. Although confirmation of disease pathophysiology is still emerging  there is increasing evidence that IgG antibodies play a key role in the damage to the peripheral nerves. People with CIDP experience fatigue  muscle weakness and a loss of feeling in their arms and legs that can get worse over time or may come and go. These symptoms can significantly impair a person's ability to function in their daily lives. Without treatment  one-third of people living with CIDP will need a wheelchair.About VYVGART ®VYVGART is a human IgG1 antibody fragment that binds to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)  resulting in the reduction of circulating IgG autoantibodies. It is the first approved FcRn blocker in the United States  EU  China and Canada for the treatment of adults with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) who are anti- acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive and in Japan for the treatment of adults with gMG who do not have sufficient response to steroids or non-steroidal immunosuppressive therapies (ISTs).About VYVGART ® HytruloVYVGART Hytrulo is a subcutaneous combination of efgartigimod alfa  a human IgG1 antibody fragment marketed for intravenous use as VYVGART ®  and recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20)  Halozyme (NASDAQ: )'s ENHANZE ® drug delivery technology to facilitate subcutaneous injection delivery of biologics.

Approximately 85% of people with MG progress to gMG within 24 months 1 where muscles throughout the body may be affected. Patients with confirmed AChR antibodies account for approximately 85% of the total gMG population.About Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP)Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) is a rare and serious autoimmune disease of the peripheral nervous system. Although confirmation of disease pathophysiology is still emerging  there is increasing evidence that IgG antibodies play a key role in the damage to the peripheral nerves. People with CIDP experience fatigue  muscle weakness and a loss of feeling in their arms and legs that can get worse over time or may come and go. These symptoms can significantly impair a person's ability to function in their daily lives. Without treatment  one-third of people living with CIDP will need a wheelchair.About VYVGART®VYVGART is a human IgG1 antibody fragment that binds to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)  resulting in the reduction of circulating IgG autoantibodies.

These findings enhance our understanding of the role that IgG autoantibodies are likely to play in the disease  and open the door to new safe  effective and well-tolerated treatments that eliminate pathogenic IgGs.”ADHERE Plenary Session (PL5) Highlights Rapid  Deep and Clinically Meaningful  and Durable Functional Improvements in CIDPIn the ADHERE study  a majority of patients treated with VYVGART Hytrulo  regardless of prior treatment  demonstrated evidence of rapid clinical improvement  and a reduced risk of relapse compared to those treated with placebo. As previously reported  ADHERE met its primary endpoint (p=0.000039) demonstrating a 61% reduction (HR: 0.39 95% CI: 0.25; 0.61) in the risk of relapse versus placebo. VYVGART Hytrulo was well-tolerated  and the observed safety and tolerability profile was consistent with previous clinical trials.Evidence of rapid onset and maintenance of clinical response: In the open-label Stage A of the ADHERE study  67% of patients treated with VYVGART Hytrulo demonstrated evidence of clinical improvement (ECI)  including 40% who had achieved ECI by the earliest possible measure at week 4. In Stage B  VYVGART Hytrulo-treated patients maintained a clinical response to treatment longer than those on placebo as evidenced by a statistically significant and clinically relevant reduction in risk of relapse. Results across both Stage A and B indicate IgG autoantibodies play a significant role in mediating the underlying biology of CIDP.In the open-label Stage A of the ADHERE study  67% of patients treated with VYVGART Hytrulo demonstrated evidence of clinical improvement (ECI)  including 40% who had achieved ECI by the earliest possible measure at week 4.

Results across both Stage A and B indicate IgG autoantibodies play a significant role in mediating the underlying biology of CIDP. Deep and clinically meaningful functional improvements : 81% of VYVGART Hytrulo-treated patients demonstrated ≥1 point improvement on the aINCAT as compared to baseline Stage A scores in ADHERE  which includes 42% of patients with ≥2 point improvement  28% with ≥3 point improvement  and 12% with ≥4 point improvement.: 81% of VYVGART Hytrulo-treated patients demonstrated ≥1 point improvement on the aINCAT as compared to baseline Stage A scores in ADHERE  which includes 42% of patients with ≥2 point improvement  28% with ≥3 point improvement  and 12% with ≥4 point improvement. Clinical benefit demonstrated regardless of prior CIDP treatment: Clinical benefit was seen across all patient subtypes  including those who had previously received corticosteroids  intravenous or subcutaneous immunoglobulin  or were on no treatment prior to study entry.Clinical benefit was seen across all patient subtypes  including those who had previously received corticosteroids  intravenous or subcutaneous immunoglobulin  or were on no treatment prior to study entry. High rate of treatment continuation: 99% of eligible patients continued to the ADHERE-Plus open-label extension study.99% of eligible patients continued to the ADHERE-Plus open-label extension study. FDA decision on CIDP sBLA expected by June 21  2024: Data from the ADHERE trial were submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as part of a supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for VYVGART Hytrulo for the treatment of CIDP. The application was accepted for Priority Review in February 2024 and has been granted a PDUFA target action date of June 21  2024.AAN presentations highlight rapid  deep  and sustained improvements in gMG with ability to reduce steroid burdenClinical trial data and real-world evidence presented during AAN continue to highlight the differentiated efficacy and safety profile of VYVGART and VYVGART Hytrulo  driving rapid  deep  and sustained improvement across disease scales and with different dosing schedules  including the ability for patients to achieve minimal symptom expression (MSE).Side effects from long-term steroid use continue to be a significant burden associated with autoimmune disease  reinforcing the importance of the favorable safety profile of VYVGART. New data presented in an oral presentation (Scientific Platform Session 38) during AAN characterize how VVYGART treatment can significantly reduce concomitant steroid use.About ADHERE Trial DesignThe ADHERE trial was a multicenter  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial evaluating VYVGART® Hytrulo (efgartigimod alfa and hyaluronidase-qvfc) for the treatment of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). ADHERE enrolled 322 adult patients with CIDP who were treatment naïve (not on active treatment within the past six months or newly diagnosed) or being treated with immunoglobulin therapy or corticosteroids. The trial consisted of an open-label Stage A followed by a randomized  placebo-controlled Stage B. In order to be eligible for the trial  the diagnosis of CIDP was confirmed by an independent panel of experts. Patients entered a run-in stage  where any ongoing CIDP treatment was stopped and in order to be eligible for Stage A had to demonstrate active disease  with clinically meaningful worsening on at least one CIDP clinical assessment tool  including INCAT  I-RODS  or mean grip strength. Treatment naïve patients were able to skip the run-in period with proof of recent worsening. To advance to Stage B  patients needed to demonstrate evidence of clinical improvement (ECI) with VYVGART Hytrulo. ECI was achieved through improvement of the INCAT score  or improvement on I-RODS or mean grip strength if those scales had demonstrated worsening during the run-in period. In Stage B  patients were randomized to either VYVGART Hytrulo or placebo for up to 48 weeks. The primary endpoint was measured once 88 total relapses or events were achieved in Stage B and was based on the hazard ratio for the time to first adjusted INCAT deterioration (i.e. relapse). After Stage B  all patients had the option to roll-over to an open-label extension study to receive VYVGART Hytrulo.See Important Safety Information below  full United States Prescribing Information for VYVGART and full Prescribing Information for VYVGART Hytrulo for additional information.What is VYVGART® (efgartigimod alfa-fcab) for intravenous (IV) infusion and what is VYVGART® HYTRULO (efgartigimod alfa and hyaluronidase-qvfc) for subcutaneous injection?VYVGART and VYVGART HYTRULO are both prescription medicines  each used to treat a condition called generalized myasthenia gravis  which causes muscles to tire and weaken easily throughout the body  in adults who are positive for antibodies directed toward a protein called acetylcholine receptor (anti-AChR antibody positive).IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONDo not use VYVGART if you have a serious allergy to efgartigimod alfa or any of the other ingredients in VYVGART.

General The remuneration policy for the members of the Executive Board of Kendrion N.V. (""Kendrion"") has been developed by the Supervisory Board and proposed for adoption to the general meeting of shareholders (the ""General Meeting"") in April 2023 and - in accordance with the commitment made during the General Meeting in April 2023 - subsequently in April 2024 to update the share ownership guideline described below. Following adoption by the General Meeting in April 2023 the remuneration policy has become applicable to (i) remuneration granted in the years 2024 up to and including 2027 - irrespective whether pay-outs and vesting of performance shares become due  occur or are made after 2027; and (ii) remuneration of Executive Board members reappointed by the General Meeting in 2023 as of the date on which the new term of office of such reappointed Executive Board member commences  it being understood that the share ownership guideline in this remuneration policy becomes effective upon adoption by the General Meeting in April 2024. The Executive Board remuneration policy is evaluated at least once every four years by the Supervisory Board. The HR Committee of the Supervisory Board will continue to keep the Supervisory Board informed of relevant market and legislative developments in order to support the periodic evaluation of the remuneration policy and related decision-making. 2. Objectives The remuneration policy serves to recruit and retain diverse  qualified  and experienced executives to deliver Kendrion's sustainable long-term value creation strategy. In addition  the remuneration policy aims to maintain an adequate link between pay and performance and appropriately align the interests of the members of the Executive Board with the interests of shareholders - and the interests of other stakeholders - and focus on the sustainable delivery of high performance over the long-term by stimulating share ownership whilst adhering to the applicable standards of good corporate governance. Taking account of Kendrion's size (in terms of revenues  average market capitalisation  total assets  and number of FTE)  its industrial market position  geographical scope and labour market competition  the companies included in the AScX Index on Euronext Amsterdam are defined as relevant reference group. Financial services  real estate and movies and entertainment companies are excluded from the reference group. Within the defined reference group  Kendrion is positioned around the median in terms of the average of the abovementioned parameters revenues  average market capitalisation  total assets  and number of FTE. The remuneration structure and level for the Executive Board is set around the median level relative to the reference group. The remuneration policy does not contain variable incentives that may be detrimental to the responsibilities of the Executive Board in defining and achieving Kendrion's sustainable long-term value creation strategy. 3. Temporary deviations remuneration policy In exceptional circumstances  the Supervisory Board can decide to temporarily deviate from the remuneration policy for members of the Executive Board. Exceptional circumstances mean circumstances in which a deviation is considered necessary to serve the long-term interests and sustainability of Kendrion or to otherwise ensure its viability. Depending on the exceptional circumstances  the Supervisory Board can resolve to deviate from any or all of the four remuneration components included in the remuneration policy for members of the Executive Board. Page 2 of 9When considering a temporary deviation from the remuneration policy  the Supervisory Board shall consider Kendrion's sustainable long-term value creation strategy  ongoing business and operational requirements as well as the financial situation of Kendrion. In addition  the temporary deviation considered should be assessed in light of the principles of reasonableness and fairness. Upon having resolved a temporary deviation from the remuneration policy  the Supervisory Board will (i) cancel and withdraw all temporary deviations from the remuneration policy prior to the first annual General Meeting following the effective date of the deviation; or (ii) propose the necessary amendments to the remuneration policy for adoption during the first annual General Meeting following the effective date of the deviation. Deviations from the remuneration policy will be reported in Kendrion's remuneration report. 4. Remuneration components The remuneration policy for the members of the Executive Board consists of four components: a fixed base salary  a short-term variable remuneration  a long-term variable remuneration and other benefits such as a pension scheme and a car allowance or lease budget. The sum of the fixed base salary  the short-term variable remuneration and the long-term variable remuneration for members of the Executive Board are considered appropriate in relation to: (i) the identity  the purpose  and values of Kendrion  (ii) the pay-ratios within Kendrion  (iii) the (international) context in which Kendrion operates and (iv) reasonable views of relevant stakeholder groups. The variable remuneration components are subject to a maximum value determined in advance in accordance with the remuneration policy. The Supervisory Board will carry out scenario analyses to assess that the pay-out level of variable remuneration components appropriately reflect performance. 5. Fixed base salary Members of the Executive Board receive a fixed base salary  the amount of which is set around the median level relative to the relevant reference group referred to above in paragraph 2 (Objective) of this remuneration policy. The fixed base salary levels can be adjusted to be decided upon by the Supervisory Board  based on general market movement and inflation figures. In addition to the above  any increase of the annual fixed base salary up to and around the prevailing median level relative to the relevant reference group referred to above in paragraph 2 (Objective)  can be decided upon by the Supervisory Board and will not be regarded as an amendment to the remuneration policy. 6. Short-term variable remuneration The short-term variable remuneration is payable in cash  the amount of which is based on the achievement of predetermined  specific  and measurable financial and non-financial driven performance criteria. CEO The short-term variable remuneration ranges from 0% to 90% of the annual fixed gross base salary of the CEO  with 60% being the target amount CFO The short-term variable remuneration ranges from 0% to 67.5% of the annual fixed gross base salary of the CFO  with 45% being the target amount 6.a Performance criteria The performance criteria for the short-term variable remuneration are based on Kendrion's strategic intent to continuously grow revenue and profitability in a sustainable way  with a lean and Page 3 of 9focused organisation  and to provide a safe and high-quality work environment to its employees. Supportive to Kendrion's strategic intent  the performance criteria for the short-term variable remuneration include financial and non-financial criteria. The financially driven performance criteria determine 60% of the short-term variable remuneration and reflect the financial priorities of Kendrion. The remaining 40% of the short-term variable remuneration is determined by non-financially driven performance criteria and reflect sustainability/ESG ambitions and other priorities directly linked to Kendrion's strategic intent. 6.b Financial performance criteria Each year the Supervisory Board selects at least three financial driven performance criteria from the list below with a view to incentivise delivery of financial priorities that support Kendrion's strategic and operational spearheads. The Supervisory Board may allocate different weight percentages to the different financial performance criteria it selects for a particular year  provided a minimum weight of 10% shall apply to a financial performance criterion. Financial performance criteria1 Net profit Return on sales (ROS) Return on investment (ROI) Organic growth Free cash flow Revenue EBITA EBITDA The performance incentive zone (threshold  target and maximum) for each financial performance criterion will be determined in advance by the Supervisory Board by reference to the strategic and operational spearheads for the respective performance year. No pay-out will be made for below threshold performance. 6.c Non-financial performance criteria Each year the Supervisory Board selects a certain number of non-financial performance criteria derived from the strategic and operational spearheads for the respective performance year  which will in any event include performance criteria in the area of sustainability/ESG (i.e. environmental  social and/or governance criteria). Achievement of each individual non-financial performance criterion will be measured by applying binary scoring model. The amount of the pay-out for the achievement of non-financial performance criteria depends on the number of non-performance criteria achieved. A predefined step curve will be applied to calculate the pay-out between the achievement of the minimum threshold number of selected non-financial performance criteria and achievement of all selected non-financial performance criteria. No pay-out will be made for below threshold performance. 1 In each case excluding items that are generated outside the ordinary course of business and the amortization of intangibles arising on acquisitions or similar corporate events. Page 4 of 96.d Investment of part of the short-term remuneration earned Members of the Executive Board must invest at least 20% of the net amount of the pay-out of the short-term remuneration earned until the required ownership level has been reached as prescribed under the 'Share ownership guideline' described in paragraph 8 of this remuneration policy. 7. Long-term variable remuneration The long-term variable remuneration component incentivises members of the Executive Board to focus on long-term sustainable value for shareholders and other stakeholders and to align the interests of the members of the Executive Board with the long-term interests of shareholders and other stakeholder groups. The members of the Executive Board annually receive conditional performance shares. The conditional performance shares will vest upon achievement of performance measured over a performance period of three years  including the year in which the conditional performance shares are granted. Vested performance shares are restricted by a two-year holding period as of vesting. 7.a Target value - size of the award The size of the award is defined as a percentage of the annual fixed gross base salary of the concerned Executive Board member as per the year in which the conditional performance shares are granted. Target value as per the year in which conditional performance shares are granted CEO 60% of the annual fixed gross base salary of the CEO CFO 50% of the annual fixed gross base salary of the CFO The actual grant (i.e. the number of conditional performance shares) is determined by the percentage of the annual fixed gross base salary and calculated on the basis of the average share price during the fourth quarter of the year immediately preceding the year in which the conditional performance shares are granted. 7.b Performance incentive zone Performance incentive zone CEO Ranges from 0% to 90% of the annual fixed gross base salary of the CEO CFO The maximum opportunity for the long-term variable remuneration shall not exceed 150% of the target value of the CFO 7.c Performance measures The vesting percentage of the performance shares is conditional upon the achievement of performance measured as: Weight Performance measure 40% Relative total shareholder return (relative TSR) 40% Basic earnings per share (EPS) Page 5 of 920% Sustainability/ESG (i.e. environmental  social and/or governance) 7.d Relative TSR To determine achievement of this performance measure  the relative TSR is measured  which means share price movements  including dividends and assuming dividends are reinvested. For the calculation of the relative TSR position  the reinvestment of cash dividend in fixed-income securities and the reinvestment of stock dividend in the relevant share applies. The TSR performance of Kendrion is measured against the performance of 20 selected TSR peer companies included in Annex 1(TSR Performance Peer Group). The TSR group of companies including Kendrion comes out at 21. The position of Kendrion in the TSR performance peer group  upon expiry of the three-year performance period  determines the score for the relative TSR measure in accordance with the following performance incentive zone: Ranking 1-3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11-21 Vesting 150% 137.5% 125% 112.5% 100% 83% 67% 50% 0% The position of Kendrion in the ranking defines the vesting for this part of the conditional grant of shares. The calculation to determine Kendrion's ranking shall be conducted by an external independent and reputable specialised firm designated by the Supervisory Board. 7.e EPS EPS is disclosed in Kendrion's consolidated financial statements and is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to shareholders of Kendrion by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the relevant period  excluding ordinary shares purchased by Kendrion and held as treasury shares. Earnings are adjusted for changes in accounting principles during the performance period. The Supervisory Board sets the performance incentive zone (threshold  target and maximum) annually by reference to the mid-term plan as approved by the Supervisory Board in the year of the grant date. Given that these targets are considered commercially sensitive  EPS targets and the achieved performance are disclosed in the Annual Integrated Report after expiry of the relevant three-year performance period. The following performance incentive zone will be used to define the vesting for this part of the conditional grant of shares: EPS < Threshold Target Maximum Vesting 0% 100% 150% Vesting is linear between threshold performance and on-target performance and between on- target performance and maximum performance. Page 6 of 97.f Sustainability/ESG The Supervisory Board will annually set a sustainability/ESG target that is aligned with Kendrion's sustainability ambitions. The Supervisory Board sets the performance incentive zone (threshold  target and maximum) annually. The achieved performance will be disclosed in the Annual Integrated Report after expiry of the relevant three-year performance period. The following performance incentive zone will be used to define the vesting for this part of the conditional grant of shares: Sustainability/ESG Vesting Threshold0% Target Maximum 100%150% Vesting is linear between threshold performance and on-target performance and between on- target performance and maximum performance. 8. Share ownership guideline An objective of the remuneration policy is to appropriately align the interests of the members of the Executive Board with the interests of shareholders by encouraging share ownership. Kendrion applies a share ownership guideline for members of the Executive Board of 200% of the annual fixed gross base salary for the CEO and 100% of the annual fixed gross base salary for the CFO. This shareholding must be gradually built up with performance shares earned under the long-term incentive  although it is permitted to sell shares to finance taxes due at the date of vesting of the performance shares  and by purchasing shares with at least 50% of the net amount of the pay-out of the short-term incentive. 9. Policy in case of change of control Unvested performance shares awarded shall be deemed vested as per the date of the change of control assuming on target performance  subject to: (i) pro rating to reflect the proportion of the normal performance period that has elapsed as per the date of the change of control  and (ii) the discretionary authority of the Supervisory Board to determine otherwise  should such deemed vesting of performance shares result in unreasonable or unequitable remuneration. 10. Adjustment and claw back The Supervisory Board is authorised to adjust the amount of the short-term and long-term variable remuneration to an appropriate level should payment thereof result in unreasonable or unequitable remuneration. In addition  a so-calledclaw-back provision applies pursuant to which the Supervisory Board has the authority to recover in whole or in part short-term and long-term variable remuneration awarded to members of the Executive Board should it transpire that such variable remuneration was unjustifiably awarded on the basis of incorrect information. 11. Pension arrangement and other benefits Members of the Executive Board participate in the defined contribution pension scheme. Kendrion N.V. will pay: (i) the cost of contributions for participation in the defined contribution scheme; (ii) the risk premium for the surviving dependents' pension (nabestaandenpensioen) and (iii) the cost of contributions for participation in the occupational disability insurance (including WIA excedentverzekering) (collectively the ""Pension and Disability Insurance Contribution""). In addition  members of the Executive Board are entitled to an annual gross allowance to compensate for the loss of accrual of pension benefits as a result of the Dutch Wage Tax Act  Page 7 of 9provided that the sum of the Pension and Disability Insurance Contribution and such annual allowance shall annually not exceed an amount of EUR 75 000. This amount may be adjusted based on market developments. No schemes have been agreed for the voluntary early retirement of members of the Executive Board. Kendrion maintains a car lease policy for members of the Executive Board. The lease budget (including fuel) is EUR 2 000 per month. Alternatively  members of the Executive Board are entitled to a monthly gross car allowance of EUR 2 000. In addition  Kendrion pays a monthly expense allowance to members of the Executive Board of up to EUR 450  to cover costs that are not suitable for individual reimbursement. The amount of the car allowance and the expense allowance are not included as a basis for calculation of the Pension and Disability Insurance Contribution  or any other (variable) remuneration or allowance  severance amount or benefit. Kendrion has arranged for a directors' and officers' liability insurance. The costs for this insurance are for the account of Kendrion. 12. Other key elements management agreement 12.a Term and termination Management agreements with members of the Executive Board are entered for a definite period of four years. The management agreement may be terminated with due observance of a notice period of six months. Kendrion is entitled to terminate the management agreement with immediate effect for cause (i.e. seriously culpable or negligent behaviour on the part of the Executive Board member). 12.b Termination fee In the event of termination of the management agreement on Kendrion's initiative  the termination fee for members of the Executive Board shall not exceed 100% of the annual fixed gross base salary (i.e. excluding short-term and long-term incentive and other elements such as pension contributions). The members of the Executive Board are not entitled to a termination fee if the contract is terminated for cause (i.e. seriously culpable or negligent behaviour on the part of the Executive Board member) or if the contract is terminated at the initiative of the Executive Board member.

Dear Shareholders  with regard to the expiry of the Long-Term Incentive Plan for the 2021-2023 period  approved by the Shareholders' Meeting on 7 April 2021  the Board of Directors of Esprinet S.p.A. resolved to submit to the approval of the Shareholders' Meeting convened for 24 April 2024 the adoption of a new share- based Long-Term Incentive Plan for 2024-2026 (the ""Plan"")  drawn up on the basis of the guidelines and general criteria established by the Appointment and Remuneration Committee  as a tool to incentivise and increase the loyalty of the most crucial company management. The purpose of the new Plan is to develop a culture with a strong orientation to creating value for shareholders  and to achieving sustainable success  taking the interests of the Company's other significant stakeholders into account. 1In particular  the Plan aims: to ensure an appropriate degree of retention and loyalty among key managers  by incentivising them to stay within the Group; to align the behaviour and interests of shareholders and key managers  by directing the latter's efforts towards the Group's strategic objectives and  at the same time creating a close correlation between the economic returns achievable by high-standing managers  company results achieved and the value created for shareholders  from the point of view of the Group financial stability  also with reference to the performance of the Esprinet stock("" Economic and Financial Performance ""); to link the Group's Economic and Financial Performance with the Group's sustainability objectives at different levels  particularly with regard to the environment and Diversity  Equity and Inclusion (the "" ESG Performance ""); to enhance the appeal and competitiveness of the remuneration package offered by the Company compared with other companies  mainly listed companies  that make substantial use of share incentive programmes. Essentially  the Plan should help to establish a management remuneration structure that incorporates both a fixed and variable component and  as far as the latter is concerned  that it also has a balanced share of equity instruments  with a view to making the Issuer's business model more sustainable in the long term - identified as a period of five years  including the envisaged lock-up period - as well as guaranteeing that remuneration is based on results actually achieved in terms of value created for shareholders and the Company's other significant stakeholders. In this sense - at the time of renewal of corporate appointments - the Plan aims to comply with the principles and criteria contained in Article 5 of the Corporate Governance Code and has been drawn up in accordance with best practices and market trends. In particular  the Plan in question was identified as the most appropriate instrument for incentivising management to pursue long-term value creation objectives  especially if  as in the case in question  it is linked to the achievement of targets relating to Economic and Financial Performance  Share Performance and ESG Performance over an extended time period. The Plan envisages a three-year time horizon  in line with the term of the previous plans based on the Company's shares and consistent with the practices of listed companies with similar characteristics. A more detailed description of the purposes and characteristics of the Plan is contained in the Information Document (the ""Information Document"")  drawn up by the Board of Directors pursuant to Article 114-bis of the TUF (Consolidated 2Law on Finance) and Article 84-bis of the Issuers' Regulation  attached to this Report and available to the public in accordance with the terms envisaged by current legislation at the registered office  as well as on the website of the eMarket Storage facility at www.emarketstorage.comand on the Company's website at www.esprinet.com. *** Based on the above elements  the Board of Directors submits the following proposed resolution to the approval of the Shareholders' Meeting: ""Dear Shareholders  we hereby submit the following proposal to your attention: the approval  pursuant to Article 114-bis of Italian Legislative Decree 58/1998  of a compensation plan ("" Long-Term Incentive Plan "") addressed to members of the Board of Directors  general managers  senior managers  employees and contractors of the Company and of group companies  as illustrated in the information document and relating to the allocation of stock grant rights on the Company's ordinary shares ("" Performance Stock Grant "") to beneficiaries  who will be identified by theBoard of Directors  in the maximum amount of 690 000 Company shares; to award the Board of Directors  with the express authority to sub- delegate  all necessary and appropriate powers to ensure the full and complete implementation of the ""Long Term Incentive Plan""  in particular  by way of example and not limited to such  all powers to (a) purchase and dispose of  pursuant to Article 2357-ter  paragraph one of the Italian Civil Code  in accordance with that authorised pursuant to the resolution referred to in item 6 of the agenda  own shares of the Company  of the number of own shares of the Company effectively necessary to execute the compensation plan  (b) determine the quantity of ordinary shares to be allocated to each beneficiary  (c) to proceed with the allocations to beneficiaries  (d) to ensure that all necessary and appropriate documents relating to the ""Long Term Incentive Plan"" are drawn up and/or finalised  as well as (e) taking any action  fulfilling any obligation  formality  communication that are necessary or appropriate for the management and/or implementation of said plan  in accordance with the applicable 3legislative and regulatory provisions  as well as  in general  the execution of this resolution."" * * * Vimercate  12 March 2024 On behalf of the Board of Directors The Chairman Maurizio Rota 4INFORMATION DOCUMENT PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ARTICLE 114-BIS OF LEGISLATIVE DECREE 58/98 (THE ITALIAN CONSOLIDATED LAW ON FINANCE  OR TUF) AND ART. 84-BIS OF THE ISSUERS' REGULATION 11971/99 AS SUBSEQUENTLY AMENDED STOCK GRANT PLAN FOR ORDINARY SHARES OF ESPRINET S.P.A.

To further support that dynamic  and the leadership teams behind it  and in anticipation of the end of his mandate in 2025  Maurice Lévy  Chairman of the Supervisory Board  submitted to the Groupe's governing bodies a proposal to change the company's governance.
