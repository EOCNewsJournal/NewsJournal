Montreal  Quebec  April 22  2024 - 2CRSi Canada  a leader in the design and manufacture of high-performance  energy-efficient computer servers  is deploying a set of Edge-Computing servers in buildings open to the public to reuse wasted heat in place of fossil fuel heating. Since 2015  2CRSi has been working to design innovative solutions for reusing the energy wasted as heat by computer servers. This research and development is central to the challenges of integrating and deploying artificial intelligences in datacenters  where heat-intensive components are needed to deliver the required computing power. 2CRSi's teams have just deployed in Quebec its ""EDGE"" solution  whose heat is reused to heat a public building during the winter  and whose operation is also planned for the summer. Edge computing technology enables data processing to be decentralized to small sites  optimizing communication in areas where bandwidth is limited. The facility's cooling systems are connected to the heating system  which previously used fossil fuels such as gas or oil. From now on  the heat generated by the computer center will be used to heat the premises. This 2CRSi solution is powered by electricity with a very low carbon footprint. Together with its local partner  2CRSI has just opened up a new market worth over 300 million Canadian dollars in Quebec. About 2CRSi Founded in Strasbourg  France  the 2CRSi Group designs  produces and markets high-performance  customized  eco-responsible servers. In fiscal year 2022-2023  the Group generated sales of 184 million euros. The Group now markets its innovative solutions (computing  storage and networking) in over 50 countries. 2CRSi has been listed since June 2018 on the Euronext regulated market in Paris (ISIN Code: FR0013341781)  and its shares were transferred to Euronext Growth in November 2022.

Now this anomaly has changed  the Paris financial centre will be able to promote innovations on the French market.”Europe’s largest issuer of active ETFs  JP Morgan Asset Management  supported the rule change but did not confirm plans to launch its suite of products in France.JPMAM head of ETF distribution EMEA Travis Spence commented: ""With active ETFs continuing to be a key driver of ETF adoption in Europe  the evolution of AMF’s stance on active ETF listings in France is positive news for investors seeking new solutions. It should also be supportive of future market growth.”Story continuesHowever  as with any evolution  there are teething issues—in this case some French platforms “were not ready” to register active ETFs following the AMF rule change  Sereyjol-Garros warned.“It is new for them so they need to adapt. On platform  investors normally select an index than a product so they need to explain what is behind the products.“Maybe there will be some time to adapt  but in one or two years  they should be offered on all the platforms.”This article originally appeared in etf.com's sister publication ETF Stream at Active ETF issuers eye French listings following rule change (etfstream.com)Permalink | © Copyright 2024 etf.com.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen's future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words 'believes'  'anticipates' and 'expects' and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen's expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen's ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen's patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen's activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen's partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen's business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law. Ipsen's business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers. The risks and uncertainties set out are not exhaustive and the reader is advised to refer to Ipsen's latest Universal Registration Document  available on ipsen.com.References1 Drugging RNA  Nature article. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-023-01790-z2 Skyhawk Therapeutics. https://www.skyhawktx.com/platformAttachment",neutral,0.02,0.96,0.02,mixed,0.22,0.26,0.51,True,English,"['RNA targeting research collaboration', 'rare neurological diseases', 'Skyhawk Therapeutics', 'Ipsen Pharma', 'Sponsored Level I American Depositary Receipt program', 'small molecule drug candidates', 'proprietary drug discovery platform', 'highest unmet needs', 'Chief Scientific Officer', 'clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company', 'rare neurological diseases', 'debilitating neurological conditions', 'reasonable macroeconomic conditions', 'several therapeutic areas', 'global biopharmaceutical company', 'three therapeutic areas', 'RNA-targeting small molecules', 'promising platform technology', 'disease target landscape1', 'development candidate validation', 'successful development candidates', 'successful DC nomination', 'early development phase', 'exclusive global rights', 'novel small molecules', 'exclusive worldwide collaboration', 'existing neuroscience expertise', 'undruggable RNA targets', 'RNA splicing targets', 'potential future acquisitions', 'novel platform', 'two candidates', 'worldwide rights', 'unique platform', 'exclusive license', 'extraordinary company', 'global hubs', 'Rare Disease', 'promising medicine', 'discovery expertise', 'neurodegenerative disease', 'autoimmune disease', 'movement disorders', 'U.S.', 'RNA expression', 'Steve Glyman', 'class treatments', 'deep passion', 'innovative therapies', 'Sergey Paushkin', 'strategic partnership', 'commercial milestones', 'upfront payment', 'tiered royalties', 'external innovation', 'development experience', 'U.K.', 'Amy Wolf', 'Jess Smith', 'Forward-Looking Statements', 'management strategy', 'current views', 'Such statements', 'actual results', 'future ability', 'similar expressions', 'clinical trial', 'financial targets', 'transformative medicines', 'expert teams', 'Maura McMarthy', 'future events', 'regulatory filings', 'historical data', 'Skyhawk contacts', 'research collaboration', 'unknown risks', 'external-growth assumptions', 'Skyhawk Therapeutics', 'Ipsen contacts', 'Ipsen Disclaimers', 'option agreement', 'responsibility', 'commercialization', 'exploration', 'PARIS', 'FRANCE', 'BOSTON', '22 April', 'Euronext', 'IPN', 'ADR', 'IPSEY', 'signing', 'activities', 'forces', 'SVP', 'Head', 'focus', 'portfolio', 'best', 'cutting-edge', 'patients', 'pipeline', 'ambition', 'people', 'terms', 'ENDS', 'Oncology', '100 years', '40 countries', 'partnerships', '80 countries', 'information', 'variety', 'skyhawktx', 'Email', 'corporate', 'communications', 'objectives', 'uncertainties', 'performance', 'Use', 'words', 'believes', 'expects', 'expectations', 'determinations', 'document', 'account', 'parameters', 'facts', 'occurrence', 'market', '41']",2024-04-06,2024-04-22,finanznachrichten.de
