39618,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rt.com/news/596394-eu-close-agreement-seize-russian-profits/,EU close to agreement on using Russian assets to help Ukraine – minister,The EU is nearing an agreement to seize the earnings from frozen Russian assets to buy arms for Ukraine  the Belgian finance minister says Read Full Article at RT.com,Moscow has previously warned that such a move would undermine “the legal foundations of European and international law”The EU is “close to a political agreement” on seizing the profits generated by Russia’s central bank reserves that remain frozen in connection with Ukraine-related sanctions  Belgian Finance Minister Vincent Van Peteghem said on Sunday.The West immobilized around $300 billion in assets belonging to the Russian central bank following the start of hostilities in February 2022  a move denounced by Moscow as “theft.” Around $280 billion of this sum is held in the EU  primarily in the Belgium-based depositary and clearing house Euroclear.While the US and UK have called for outright seizure of those funds  numerous reports suggest that EU countries are taking a more cautious approach  citing the lack of a legal basis for such a drastic move as well as fears of Russian retaliation.Meanwhile  EU officials have been mulling a plan to apply a windfall tax on the profits generated by the assets. According to Eurostat  the reserves frozen in the EU generated €4.4 billion ($4.7 billion) in interest income in 2023 alone. In March  a senior EU official projected  as quoted by Reuters  that €15-20 billion ($16-21 billion) would be generated in after-tax profits by 2027.The same month  the EU’s top diplomat  Josep Borrell  proposed handing over 90% of those profits to the European Peace Facility to be used for procurement of arms for Ukraine. The rest would be transferred to EU budgets to support Kiev’s defense industry.Now  according to Peteghem  EU nations appear to be close to finding common ground on this plan. The minister said  as quoted by Bloomberg  that the first tax collection could take place as early as July 1.However  Politico reported last month that Hungary  Slovakia  Malta  and Luxembourg have challenged the idea of using the funds to aid Ukraine. While the first two countries are opposed to procuring weapons for Kiev altogether  the latter two have reportedly voiced misgivings about not being consulted on such a far-reaching plan.Moscow has vehemently denounced the West’s push to use its immobilized funds to support Ukraine. Commenting on Borrell’s proposal last month  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov warned that it could destroy “the legal foundations of European and international law.”He also noted that transferring the Russian funds to Kiev would tarnish the bloc’s image and cautioned that those advancing the EU’s plan “will be subject to legal prosecution for many decades to come.”,positive,0.66,0.32,0.01,negative,0.02,0.27,0.71,True,English,"['Russian assets', 'EU', 'agreement', 'Ukraine', 'minister', 'Belgian Finance Minister Vincent Van Peteghem', 'Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov', 'first two countries', 'Russian central bank', 'first tax collection', 'central bank reserves', 'European Peace Facility', 'senior EU official', 'Russian retaliation', 'windfall tax', 'EU countries', 'legal foundations', 'international law', 'political agreement', 'Ukraine-related sanctions', 'Belgium-based depositary', 'clearing house', 'outright seizure', 'numerous reports', 'cautious approach', 'legal basis', 'interest income', 'top diplomat', 'defense industry', 'common ground', 'legal prosecution', 'many decades', 'Russian funds', 'EU officials', 'EU budgets', 'EU nations', 'tax profits', 'The West', 'Josep Borrell', 'immobilized funds', 'drastic move', 'reaching plan', 'Moscow', 'connection', 'Sunday', 'assets', 'start', 'hostilities', 'February', 'sum', 'Euroclear', 'lack', 'fears', 'Eurostat', 'March', 'Reuters', 'procurement', 'arms', 'Kiev', 'Bloomberg', 'place', 'July', 'Politico', 'Hungary', 'Slovakia', 'Malta', 'Luxembourg', 'idea', 'weapons', 'latter', 'misgivings', 'push', 'proposal', 'bloc', 'image']",2024-04-22,2024-04-23,rt.com

Approval of remuneration report (item 14) The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to approve the Board of Directors' report on remuneration pursuant to Chapter 8  Section 53 a of the Swedish Companies Act. The Board of Directors' proposal regarding authorisation for the Board of Directors to acquire and sell treasury shares (item 15) Acquisitions of treasury shares The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorises the Board of Directors to resolve to acquire treasury shares in accordance with the following. Acquisitions may be made on Nasdaq Stockholm or in accordance with a tender offer to all Norva24 shareholders. Acquisitions of shares may not result in the total holding of treasury shares  at any time  exceeding ten (10) per cent of all shares in Norva24. Acquisitions of shares on Nasdaq Stockholm may only be affected at a price within the currently effective registered price interval on Nasdaq Stockholm  meaning the price interval between the highest bid price and the lowest ask price. Acquisitions in accordance with a tender offer according to 1 above shall be affected at a price corresponding to the lowest share price at the time of the offer with a maximum premium of twenty (20) per cent. The authorisation may be used on one or several occasions  but only until the 2025 Annual General Meeting. The Board of Director's report pursuant to Chapter 19 Section 22 of the Swedish Companies Act will be available at Norva24 and on Norva24's website  www.norva24.com  no later than three weeks prior to the Annual General Meeting and will be sent  free of charge  to shareholders who so request and inform the Company of their address. Sales of treasury shares The Board also proposes that the Annual General Meeting authorises the Board of Directors to resolve to sell treasury shares in accordance with the following. Sales of shares may take place on Nasdaq Stockholm at a price within the registered price range at any given time. Sales of shares may also take place outside Nasdaq Stockholm  with or without deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights and with or without payment in kind or payment by way of set-off. Such sales may be made at a price in SEK or value for obtained property corresponding to the price for the sold Norva24 shares at the time of the sale  with a divergence found reasonable by the Board of Directors. The number of shares that may be sold should not amount to more than ten (10) per cent of the total number of shares in Norva24. Sales in connection with company acquisitions may be made at a market value as decided by the Board of Directors. The authorisation may be used on one or more occasions  but only until the 2025 Annual General Meeting. The purpose of the abovementioned authorisations to acquire and sell treasury shares is to finance major acquisitions of operations through payment with treasury shares and to continuously be able to adapt Norva24's capital structure and thereby contribute to an increase in value for shareholders and enable the assurance of costs and delivery of shares in connection with Norva24's long-term incentive plans. The possibility to deviate from the shareholders' preferential rights at sales of treasury shares is justified by the fact that such sales may be made with greater speed  flexibility and are more cost-effective than a sale to all shareholders. The Company cannot provide shareholders the possibility to exercise any preferential right if the Company's treasury shares are used for the purpose of enabling financing of major acquisitions or as a part of the execution of Norva24's long-term incentive plans. The Board of Directors' proposal for resolution on authorisation for the Board of Directors to resolve on new issue of shares (item 16) The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to authorise the Board of Directors to  on one or several occasions until the Annual General Meeting 2025  resolve on a new issue of shares. The number of shares to be issued with the authorisation shall be no more than 10 percent of the registered share capital at the time of the new share issue resolution. The new issue of shares can be made with or without deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights and with or without provisions for contribution in kind  set-off or other conditions. The purpose of the authorisation is to increase the Company's financial flexibility and enable acquisitions by payment of shares. If the Board of Directors resolves on an issue with deviation from the shareholders' preferential right  the reason may be to add new capital and/or new company owners of strategic importance to the Company and/or the acquisition of other companies or businesses. At a deviation from the shareholders' preferential right  the issue rate shall be determined in accordance with market conditions. Other terms may be resolved by the Board of Directors. The proposal is subject to the support of shareholders representing at least two-thirds of the votes cast and the shares represented at the meeting. The Board of Directors' proposal regarding (A) resolution on adoption of a long-term incentive program for management and key personnel and (B) transfer of shares under the long-term incentive program (item 17) The board of directors (the ""Board of Directors"") of Norva24 Group AB (publ) (the ""Company"" and  together with its subsidiaries  the ""Group"") proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves on the adoption of a stock-option based long-term incentive program for the Group's management and key personnel (""LTIP 2024"") and on transfer of bought-back shares according to items (A) and (B) below. (A) - Adoption of a long-term incentive program for management and key personnel Overview and background LTIP 2024 is a program under which the participants  conditioned by an investment in the Company's shares  will be granted stock options to acquire additional shares in the Company for a pre-determined price (""Options"")  subject to vesting over a three-year period in accordance with the below. LTIP 2024 follows the same structure as the stock-option based long-term incentive program adopted at the Annual General Meeting 2023. LTIP 2024 encompasses up to 40 employees of the Group. LTIP 2024 is intended for members of management and key personnel. The Board of Directors believes that an equity-based incentive program in the form of stock options is a central part of an attractive and competitive remuneration package in order to attract  retain and motivate competent members of management and key personnel  and to focus the participants on delivering exceptional performance  which contributes to value creation for all shareholders. Investment in Qualification Shares Participation in the LTIP 2024 requires that participants  directly or indirectly through a company  with their own funds  acquire shares in the Company at market price on Nasdaq Stockholm (""Qualification Shares""). The Qualification Shares shall be acquired no later than 31 July 2024 (the ""Qualification End Date""). Subject to approval by the Board of Directors  the participants may also request to have shares that the participant already have acquired during 2024 to be designated as Qualification Shares. If the participant has inside information or otherwise is prevented from acquiring Qualification Shares before the Qualification End Date  the Qualification Shares must instead be acquired as soon as possible  and no later than 31 December 2024. Additional persons who have been recruited but who have not yet started their employment in the Group before the Qualification End Date  may be offered participation conditional on the employment being started and the relevant participant acquiring Qualification Shares no later than 31 December 2024. Conditions for the Options The following conditions shall apply for the Options. The Options shall be granted free of charge to the participants. For each Qualification Share acquired by a participant  the participant will be awarded 40 Options. The maximum number of Options that may be allocated to the participants under LTIP 2024 is 2 283 534. The maximum allocation per individual in each category shall be 246 622 Options for Category 1 (CEO)  164 414 Options for Category 2 (CFO)  109 609 Options for Category 3 (Country CEOs) and 82 207 Options for Category 4 (Key Resources) 54 805 Options for Category 5 (Branch managers and other key employees). The Board of Directors shall resolve upon the allocation of Options (on one or several occasions) as soon as possible after the Qualification End Date (the ""Grant Date""). Each Option entitles the holder to acquire one share in the Company at a pre-determined exercise price corresponding to 120 percent of the volume weighted average price for the Company's share on Nasdaq Stockholm during the twenty (20) trading days preceding the date of publication of the Group's interim financial report for January-March 2024. For participants who have been recruited but who have not yet started their employment in the Group before the Qualification End Date and that have been offered participation in LTIP 2024  the pre-determined exercise price will correspond to 120 percent of the volume weighted average price for the Company's share on Nasdaq Stockholm during the twenty (20) trading days preceding the relevant Grant Date. The Options shall vest over a three-year period  with one third of the Options vesting on the first anniversary of the Grant Date  one third of the Options vesting on the second anniversary of the Grant Date  and one third of the Options vesting on the third anniversary of the Grant Date (the ""Vesting End Date"")  and thereafter be exercisable  provided that the participant (i) has remained employed by the Group  and (ii) has retained and not sold or transferred any of its Qualification Shares prior to the Vesting End Date (subject to customary exceptions  as determined by the Board of Directors). In the event that a participant's employment is terminated before all Options have vested and been exercised  the participant will only be entitled to exercise the Options that have been vested before the participant's employment was terminated (subject to customary exceptions  as determined by the Board of Directors). The Options may be exercised during a period of three (3) months from the Vesting End Date. The Options are non-transferable and may not be pledged. The Options may be granted by the Company as well as any other company in the Group. In the event of a public take-over offer  a sale of the Group's business  a significant asset sale  liquidation  merger or any other such transaction affecting the Company  the Options will vest immediately. Scope The total amount of shares in the Company that can be allocated to the participants under LTIP 2024 amounts to 2 283 534 shares  which represents approximately 1.25 percent of the outstanding shares and votes in the Company as of the date of this proposal. Recalculations The number of Options  the number of shares each Option entitles the holder to acquire and the price per share shall be subject to customary re-calculation terms (as determined by the Board of Directors)  for example in the event that changes occur in the Company's equity capital structure (such as a bonus issue  merger  rights issue  share split or reverse share split or reduction of the share capital) and similar corporate actions  with regard to customary practice for similar incentive plans. Plan rules and adjustment of the LTIP 2024 terms The Board of Directors  or the Remuneration Committee  shall be responsible for preparing the detailed plan rules of LTIP 2024  in accordance with the above mentioned terms and guidelines. To this end  the Board of Directors shall be entitled to make adjustments to comply with foreign regulations or market practice  including resolving on cash or other settlement if deemed favourable for the Group based on foreign tax regulations. The Board of Directors may also make other adjustments if significant changes in the Group or its environment would result in a situation where the adopted terms and conditions of LTIP 2024 no longer serve their purpose. Delivery of shares under LTIP 2024 In order to secure the delivery of shares in the Company under LTIP 2024  the Board of Directors proposes that the Board of Directors shall be entitled to transfer bought-back shares in the Company to the participants (pursuant to item (B) below). Alternatively  if the applicable majority requirements are not met  the Board of Directors proposes that the Company shall enter into so-called equity swap agreements with a third party in order to fulfil its obligations under the LTIP 2024. The Board of Directors regards the first alternative  i.e. the transfer of bought-back shares to the participants  to be the most cost efficient and flexible arrangement for the delivery of shares. Estimated costs and effect of key performance indicators LTIP 2024 will be accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2 on share-based payments. Social security costs will be expensed in the income statement according to UFR 7 during the vesting period. Assuming a share price at the time of allocation of Options of SEK 30  a strike price for the Options at SEK 36  an annual increase in the share price of 20 percent and that all Options are allocated up-front  the average annual cost for the Company is estimated to approximately SEK 2.5 million per year before tax. The average annual social security costs over the vesting period are estimated to approximately a total of SEK 2.4 million  based on the above assumptions  that all Options are fully vested  a vesting period for all Options of three years and estimated social security costs of 20 percent. The social security costs associated with LTIP 2024 will be covered by the cash received from sale of treasury shares by the Company on Nasdaq Stockholm. The social security costs associated with LTIP 2024 will hence be fully covered and will not affect the Company's cash flow. The total cost of LTIP 2024  including all social security costs  is estimated to amount to approximately SEK 14.7 million under the above assumptions. The costs associated with LTIP 2024 are expected to have a marginal effect on the Company's key performance indicators. Preparation of this proposal LTIP 2024 has been initiated by the Board of Directors and prepared together with external advisors based on an evaluation of prior incentive programs and market practice for comparable companies. LTIP 2024 has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee and reviewed by the Board of Directors. Other incentive programs in the Group Information about existing incentive programs can be found in the Company's annual report 2023. Majority requirements A resolution to introduce LTIP 2024  in accordance with the Board of Directors' proposal pursuant to this item (A)  is valid where supported by shareholders holding more than half of the votes cast at the Annual General Meeting. (B) - Transfer of shares under LTIP 2024 Background In order to implement LTIP 2024 in a cost-efficient and flexible manner  the Board of Directors has considered different methods for ensuring the delivery of shares in the Company to participants upon exercise of the Options under LTIP 2024. Based on these considerations  the Board of Directors intends to ensure delivery by transferring shares held by the Company to the participants. A transfer of the Company's bought-back shares in this way requires a particularly high majority to be met at the Annual General Meeting. In the event that the Board of Directors' proposal regarding the transfer of bought-back shares to the participants does not receive the required majority  the Board of Directors intends to enter into an equity swap agreement with a third party to secure that delivery of shares in the Company can be made to the participants. The Board of Directors' proposal on resolution of transfer of bought-back shares to the participants The Board of Directors therefore proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves on the transfer of bought-back shares in accordance with the terms set out below: Transfer can be made of a maximum of 2 283 534 shares in the Company to participants in LTIP 2024 (or a higher number that may result from a recalculation in the event that changes occur in the Company's equity capital structure (such as a bonus issue  merger  rights issue  share split or reverse share split or reduction of the share capital) and similar corporate actions  with regard to customary practice for similar incentive plans). The transfer of shares shall be made against payment of a pre-determined exercise price corresponding to 120 percent of the volume weighted average price for the Company's share on Nasdaq Stockholm during the twenty (20) trading days preceding the date of publication of the Group's interim financial report for January-March 2024 (or  for participants who have been recruited but who have not yet started their employment in the Group before the Qualification End Date  120 percent of the volume weighted average price for the Company's share on Nasdaq Stockholm during the twenty (20) trading days preceding the relevant Grant Date)  and at the time according to the terms and conditions when the participants in LTIP 2024 are entitled to receive shares. The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights is that the transfer of the shares is part of executing and settling LTIP 2024. Therefore  and in light of the above  the Board of Directors considers beneficial for Company to transfer shares in accordance with the proposal. Majority requirement The Board of Directors' proposal above is valid if supported by shareholders holding no less than nine-tenths of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the Annual General Meeting. The Board of Directors' proposal pursuant to this item (B) is conditional upon that the Board of Directors' proposal on LTIP 2024 is approved by the Annual General Meeting (item (A) above). _______________________ Documents The Board of Directors' complete proposals are set out above.

Objectives and reasons for the proposal Truecaller has during a number of years resolved to implement long-term incentive programs. Following an evaluation  the board of directors has decided to propose to the Annual General Meeting the establishment of a new incentive program for current employees based on employee stock options. The purpose of employee stock option program 2024:1 is to reward long term commitments of certain senior executives  key employees and other employees in the Truecaller group  to ensure that the Company's long term value increase is reflected in the remuneration for the participants of the program  to contribute to the capability to retain competent co-workers and to otherwise increase shared incentives between the group's employees and the Company's shareholders. In view of the terms proposed below  the size of the allotment and other circumstances  the board of directors assesses that employee stock option program 2024:1 is well-balanced and that it will be beneficial for the Company and its shareholders. To secure the Company's commitments under the employee stock option program 2024:1  the board of directors also proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves on a directed issue of warrants and to approve the transfer of warrants in accordance with item B below. Proposed resolution regarding implementation of employee stock option program 2024:1 (Item 17 (A)) The board of directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to implement employee stock option program 2024:1  according to the following main principles: Employee stock option program 2024:1 shall include not more than 7 400 000 employee stock options. Each employee stock option shall initially entitle the holder to subscribe for one new ordinary share of series B in the Company at a subscription price of SEK 37.83  corresponding to 125 percent of the volume weighted average price of the ordinary share of series B according to the official share list of Nasdaq Stockholm during the 30 trading days preceding the day of the notice to the Annual General Meeting 2024. The subscription price and the number of shares for which each employee stock option entitles the holder to subscribe may be subject to recalculation pursuant to a bonus issue  share split  new issue with preferential rights and similar measures  whereby conventional terms and conditions for recalculation shall be applied.Employee stock option program 2024:1 shall comprise the following categories of employees  whereby no participant is entitled a minimum allotment. Category Maximum number of employee stock options per person A. Senior executives and key employees 550 000 (maximum 30 persons) B. Other employees (maximum 350 80 000 persons) The allotment per participant will depend on position within the Truecaller group. Employees who are also board members in Truecaller AB do not have the right to participate in employee stock option program 2024:1. Allotted employee stock options shall be offered free of charge. Such offer shall be made within 10 banking days from the date the resolution on allotment is made. Allotment may take place during the period until the end of the next Annual General Meeting. Over- allocation may not occur. For holders in category A the following shall apply: 1/3 of the employee stock options may be exercised to subscribe for new ordinary shares of series B during the period 15 June 2026 - 28 February 2027  1/3 of the employee stock options may be exercised to subscribe for new ordinary shares of series B during the period 15 June 2027 - 28 February 2028 and 1/3 of the employee stock options may be exercised to subscribe for new ordinary shares of series B during the period 15 June 2028 - 28 February 2029. For holders in category B the following shall apply: 1/2 of the employee stock options may be exercised to subscribe for new ordinary shares of series B during the period 15 June 2026 - 28 February 2027 and 1/2 of the employee stock options may be exercised to subscribe for new ordinary shares of series B during the period 15 June 2027 - 28 February 2028. The reason for the duration of 1/3 (for holders in category A) and 1/2 (for holders in category B) of the employee stock options being less than three years is that the board of directors has made the assessment that a longer duration than the proposed not sufficiently would contribute to the ability to retain key competence and increase motivation for the employees. The holder shall be entitled to exercise the employee stock options during the periods set out above  provided that the holder concerned at the time of exercise (i) is still employed by the Company or by any company within the group  (ii) has not received notice of dismissal (Sw. avsked ) or termination (Sw. uppsägning ) from his or her employment in the Company or in any company within the group for reasons other than scarcity of work (Sw. arbetsbrist ) and (iii) the Company achieves a combination of revenue growth rate(%) and adjusted EBITDA (%) of at least 25 percent annually  on average  during the two financial years preceding the respective exercise period. In the event that the performance target falls below 25 percent  the entitlement to exercise the employee stock options shall decrease linearly  and in the event that the performance target falls below 5 percent  no exercise of employee stock options can be made.Upon exercise  each employee stock option will entitle the holder to receive one warrant immediately exercisable for one ordinary share of series B against payment of the subscription price. For participation in employee stock option program 2024:1 it is required that such participation is legally possible  and that such participation in the board of directors' opinion is possible at reasonable administrative costs and with reasonable financial resources. Issued employee stock options do not constitute securities and may not be transferred  pledged or otherwise disposed of by the holder. In other respects  the board of directors shall establish the general terms for participation in the program and  in the event of company related events  market conditions  local legislation or other rules  regulatory changes  or other events  the board of directors shall be entitled to make deviations from and adjustments of the terms and conditions of employee stock option program 2024:1. Directed issue of warrants and approval of transfer of warrants to secure the Company's commitments under employee stock option program 2024:1 (Item 17 (B)) To enable the Company's delivery of shares pursuant to employee stock option program 2024:1 the board of directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves on a directed issue of warrants and to approve the transfer of warrants on the following terms: A maximum of 7 400 000 warrants shall be issued  entailing an increase in the share capital of a maximum of SEK 14 800. Right to subscribe shall  with deviation from the preferential right for existing shareholders  reside in the Company's wholly owned subsidiary True Software Scandinavia Incentive AB  reg. no. 559011-2073 (the "" Subsidiary ""). Subscription must be completed no later than three weeks after the resolution on issue of warrants. The board of directors shall be entitled to extend the subscription period. The warrants shall be issued free of charge. Each warrant shall entitle the holder to subscribe for one new ordinary share of series B in the Company. Each warrant shall entitle the holder to subscribe for one new ordinary share of series B in the Company at a subscription price of SEK 37.83  corresponding to 125 percent of the volume weighted average price of the ordinary share of series B according to the official share list of Nasdaq Stockholm during the 30 trading days preceding the day of the notice to the Annual General Meeting 2024. The subscription price and the number of shares for which each warrant entitles the holder to subscribe may be subject to recalculation pursuant to a bonus issue  share split  new issue with preferential rights and similar measures  whereby conventional terms and conditions for recalculation shall be applied. Subscription of ordinary shares of series B in the Company by virtue of the warrants may take place during the period from and including 15 June 2026 until and including 28 February 2029. The share premium shall be transferred to the unrestricted premium reserve. Shares issued following exercise of warrants during a certain financial year shall entitle to dividend for the first time on the record day for dividend which occurs following registration of the shares with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.The complete terms and conditions for the warrants are set out in "" Terms and conditions for warrants of series 2024:1 regarding subscription of shares in Truecaller AB "". The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential right is that the issue forms part of the implementation of employee stock option program 2024:1. In view of what is set forth under Objectives and reasons for the proposal above  the board of directors is of the opinion that it is of benefit to the Company and its shareholders that certain senior executives  key employees and other employees of the group are offered to participate in employee stock option program 2024:1. The board of directors further proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to approve that the Subsidiary transfers warrants to participants in employee stock option program 2024:1. Finally  the board of directors proposes that the board of directors  or anyone appointed by the board of directors  should be authorised to make such minor adjustments to the above proposal that may be necessary in connection with the registration procedures with the Swedish Companies Registration Office  and possible registration of the warrants with Euroclear. Costs and effects on important key ratios The costs of employee stock option program 2024:1  which are charged in the profit and loss account  are calculated in accordance with the accounting standard IFRS 2 and distributed over the duration of the employee stock option program 2024:1. The calculation has been made based on the following assumptions: (i) a market price of the Truecaller ordinary share of series B of SEK 30.26 based on the volume-weighted average price during the period 7 March 2024 to 19 April 2024  (ii) an expected dividend of 1.2 percent per year  and (iii) an employee turnover of 14 percent per year. In total  this can lead to maximum costs for the employee stock option program 2024:1 of approximately SEK 75.7 million  excluding social security costs. The costs for social security charges are estimated to approximately SEK 15.6 million assuming an annual share price increase of 25 percent during the duration of the employee stock option program 2024:1. The employee stock options do not have a market value since they are not transferable. However  the board of directors has calculated a theoretical value of the employee stock options using the Black & Scholes valuation model. The calculations have been based on the term of the employee stock options  the subscription price  an assumed share price of SEK 30.26 per ordinary share of series B  an average risk-free interest rate of 2.7 percent  an assumed average volatility of 60 percent  and an expected dividend of 1.2 percent per year. In accordance with this valuation  the average value of the employee stock options in the employee stock option program 2024:1 is approximately SEK 10.51 per option. The expected average annual costs of the employee stock option program 2024:1  including annualized social security charges of approximately SEK 3.2 million  would have corresponded to approximately 5.1 percent of Truecaller's total annual employee costs 2023. Given the above assumptions regarding scope and costs  and that the employee stock option program 2024:1 was introduced in 2022 instead  it is estimated that the key ratio earnings per share for the full year 2023 had decreased from SEK 1.49 to approximately SEK 1.42. The board of directors deems that the positive effects on earnings that are expected to result from increased share ownership among senior executives  key employees and other employees ",neutral,0.06,0.93,0.01,positive,0.81,0.17,0.02,True,English,"['employee stock option program', 'Board proposal', 'Truecaller', 'long term value increase', 'volume weighted average price', 'employee stock option program', 'next Annual General Meeting', 'one new ordinary share', 'person A.

Objectives and reasons fo…,"The board of directors' of Truecaller AB  reg. no. 559278-2774 (the ""Company"")  proposal for resolution regarding implementation of employee stock option program 2024:2  directed issue of warrants and approval of transfer of warrants to fulfil the Company's commitments under the employee stock option program (Item 19) The board of directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves on: implementation of employee stock option program for Alan Mamedi (Chief Executive Officer  board member and co-founder of the Company) and Nami Zarringhalam (Chief Strategy Officer  board member and co-founder of the Company) - employee stock option program 2024:2; and hedging arrangements in respect of the employee stock option program 2024:2  consisting of a directed issue of warrants and approval to transfer the warrants. Objectives and reasons for the proposal Truecaller has during a number of years resolved to implement long-term incentive programs. Following an evaluation  the board of directors has decided to propose to the Annual General Meeting the establishment of a new incentive program for Alan Mamedi and Nami Zarringhalam. The purpose of employee stock option program 2024:2 is to reward long term commitments of the participants and to ensure that the Company's long term value increase is reflected in the remuneration for the participants of the program. In view of the terms proposed below  the size of the allotment and other circumstances  the board of directors assesses that employee stock option program 2024:2 is well-balanced and that it will be beneficial for the Company and its shareholders. To secure the Company's commitments under the employee stock option program 2024:2  the board of directors also proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves on a directed issue of warrants and to approve the transfer of warrants in accordance with item B below. Proposed resolution regarding implementation of employee stock option program 2024:2 (Item 19 (A)) The board of directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to implement employee stock option program 2024:2  according to the following main principles: Employee stock option program 2024:2 shall include Alan Mamedi (maximum 550 000 employee stock options) and Nami Zarringhalam (maximum 550 000 employee stock options)  which means that a maximum of 1 100 000 employee stock options will be allotted in employee stock option program 2024:2. Each employee stock option shall initially entitle the holder to subscribe for one new ordinary share of series B in the Company at a subscription price of SEK 37.83  corresponding to 125 percent of the volume weighted average price of the ordinary share of series B according to the official share list of Nasdaq Stockholm during the 30 trading days preceding the day of the notice to the Annual General Meeting 2024. The subscription price and the number of shares for which each employee stock option entitles the holder to subscribe may be subject to recalculation pursuant to a bonus issue  share split  new issue with preferential rights and similar measures  whereby conventional terms and conditions for recalculation shall be applied.Allotted employee stock options shall be offered free of charge. Such offer shall be made within 10 banking days from the date the resolution on allotment is made. Allotment may take place during the period until the end of the next Annual General Meeting. Over- allocation may not occur. 1/3 of the employee stock options may be exercised to subscribe for new ordinary shares of series B during the period 15 June 2026 - 28 February 2027  1/3 of the employee stock options may be exercised to subscribe for new ordinary shares of series B during the period 15 June 2027 - 28 February 2028 and 1/3 of the employee stock options may be exercised to subscribe for new ordinary shares of series B during the period 15 June 2028 - 28 February 2029. The reason for the duration of 1/3 of the employee stock options being less than three years is that the board of directors has made the assessment that a longer duration than the proposed not sufficiently would contribute to the ability to reward the contribution of the participants. The holder shall be entitled to exercise the employee stock options during the periods set out above  provided that the holder concerned at the time of exercise (i) is still employed by the Company or by any company within the group  (ii) has not received notice of dismissal (Sw. avsked ) or termination (Sw. uppsägning ) from his or her employment in the Company or in any company within the group for reasons other than scarcity of work (Sw. arbetsbrist ) and (iii) the Company achieves a combination of revenue growth rate(%) and adjusted EBITDA (%) of at least 25 percent annually  on average  during the two financial years preceding the respective exercise period. In the event that the performance target falls below 25 percent  the entitlement to exercise the employee stock options shall decrease linearly  and in the event that the performance target falls below 5 percent  no exercise of employee stock options can be made. Upon exercise  each employee stock option will entitle the holder to receive one warrant immediately exercisable for one ordinary share of series B against payment of the subscription price. For participation in employee stock option program 2024:2 it is required that such participation is legally possible  and that such participation in the board of directors' opinion is possible at reasonable administrative costs and with reasonable financial resources. Issued employee stock options do not constitute securities and may not be transferred  pledged or otherwise disposed of by the holder. In other respects  the board of directors shall establish the general terms for participation in the program and  in the event of company related events  market conditions  local legislation or other rules  regulatory changes  or other events  the board of directors shall be entitled to make deviations from and adjustments of the terms and conditions of employee stock option program 2024:2. However  the participants shall not participate in the board of directors' establishment of the terms of employee stock option program 2024:2. Directed issue of warrants and approval of transfer of warrants to secure the Company's commitments under employee stock option program 2024:2 (Item 19 (B)) To enable the Company's delivery of shares pursuant to employee stock option program 2024:2 the board of directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves on a directed issue of warrants and to approve the transfer of warrants on the following terms: A maximum of 1 100 000 warrants shall be issued  entailing an increase in the share capital of a maximum of SEK 2 200.Right to subscribe shall  with deviation from the preferential right for existing shareholders  reside in the Company's wholly owned subsidiary True Software Scandinavia Incentive AB  reg. no. 559011-2073 (the "" Subsidiary ""). Subscription must be completed no later than three weeks after the resolution on issue of warrants. The board of directors shall be entitled to extend the subscription period. The warrants shall be issued free of charge. Each warrant shall entitle the holder to subscribe for one new ordinary share of series B in the Company. Each warrant shall entitle the holder to subscribe for one new ordinary share of series B in the Company at a subscription price of SEK 37.83  corresponding to to 125 percent of the volume weighted average price of the ordinary share of series B according to the official share list of Nasdaq Stockholm during the 30 trading days preceding the day of the notice to the Annual General Meeting 2024. The subscription price and the number of shares for which each warrant entitles the holder to subscribe may be subject to recalculation pursuant to a bonus issue  share split  new issue with preferential rights and similar measures  whereby conventional terms and conditions for recalculation shall be applied. Subscription of ordinary shares of series B in the Company by virtue of the warrants may take place during the period from and including 15 June 2026 until and including 28 February 2029. The share premium shall be transferred to the unrestricted premium reserve. Shares issued following exercise of warrants during a certain financial year shall entitle to dividend for the first time on the record day for dividend which occurs following registration of the shares with the Swedish Companies Registration Office. The complete terms and conditions for the warrants are set out in "" Terms and conditions for warrants of series 2024:2 regarding subscription of shares in Truecaller AB "". The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential right is that the issue forms part of the implementation of employee stock option program 2024:2. In view of what is set forth under Objectives and reasons for the proposal above  the board of directors is of the opinion that it is of benefit to the Company and its shareholders that Alan Mamedi and Nami Zarringhalam are offered to participate in employee stock option program 2024:2. The board of directors further proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves to approve that the Subsidiary transfers warrants to participants in employee stock option program 2024:2. Finally  the board of directors proposes that the board of directors  or anyone appointed by the board of directors  should be authorised to make such minor adjustments to the above proposal that may be necessary in connection with the registration procedures with the Swedish Companies Registration Office  and possible registration of the warrants with Euroclear. Costs and effects on important key ratios The costs of employee stock option program 2024:2  which are charged in the profit and loss account  are calculated in accordance with the accounting standard IFRS 2 and distributed over the duration of the employee stock option program 2024:2. The calculation has been made based on the following assumptions: (i) a market price of the Truecaller ordinary share of series B of SEK 30.26 based on the volume-weighted average price during the period 7 March 2024 to19 April 2024  (ii) an expected dividend of 1.2 percent per year  and (iii) an employee turnover of 0 percent per year. In total  this can lead to maximum costs for the employee stock option program 2024:2 of approximately SEK 11.6 million  excluding social security costs. The costs for social security charges are estimated to approximately SEK 2.3 million assuming an annual share price increase of 25 percent during the duration of the employee stock option program 2024:2. The employee stock options do not have a market value since they are not transferable. However  the board of directors has calculated a theoretical value of the employee stock options using the Black & Scholes valuation model. The calculations have been based on the term of the employee stock options  the subscription price  an assumed share price of SEK 30.26 per ordinary share of series B  an average risk-free interest rate of 2.7 percent  an assumed average volatility of 60 percent  and an expected dividend of 1.2 percent per year. In accordance with this valuation  the value of the employee stock options in the employee stock option program 2024:2 is approximately SEK 10.51 per option. The expected annual costs of the employee stock option program 2024:2  including annualized social security charges of approximately SEK 0.5 million  would have corresponded to approximately 0.8 percent of Truecaller's total annual employee costs 2023. Given the above assumptions regarding scope and costs  and that the employee stock option program 2024:2 was introduced in 2022 instead  it is estimated that the key ratio earnings per share for the full year 2023 had decreased from SEK 1.49 to approximately SEK 1.48. The board of directors deems that the positive effects on earnings that are expected to result from increased share ownership of Alan Mamedi and Nami Zarringhalam  which may be further increased through the employee stock option program 2024:2  outweighs the costs related to the employee stock option program 2024:2. Dilution Upon full exercise of all employee stock options  1 100 000 new ordinary shares of series B can be issued  which corresponds to a dilution of approximately 0.29 percent of the total number of shares and approximately 0.14 percent of the total number of votes in the Company  however  subject to any potential adjustment which may occur under the terms and conditions for the warrants. Accordingly  the program offers the employees the possibility to increase their shareholding in the Company to the corresponding figure.1 Preparation of the matter The proposal regarding employee stock option program 2024:2 has been prepared by the board of directors in consultation with external advisors. Alan Mamedi and Nami Zarringhalam have not participated in the preparation of the matter or the determination of the terms of employee stock option program 2024:2.

To meet even higher power requirements  up to four EFOY H 2 PowerPacks can be connected and enable an output of up to 200 kW in cluster configuration.Target applications therefore include emergency power supplies  e.g. for IT backup and in hospitals  as well as mobile power supplies for construction sites and events  and continuous power supplies for self-sufficient companies  for example. SFC Energy is responding to correspondingly high market demand with its push into higher power classes. The transition to series production and the official market introduction are planned for the beginning of 2025  with first pilot installations in the current year.Björn Ledergerber  Senior Vice President Hydrogen & Corporate Development at SFC Energy AG: ""The EFOY H 2 PowerPack X50 incorporates many years of expertise in the development and use of fuel cell technology. Following the series launch of the H 2 Genset(2) at the beginning of April  SFC is presenting the next product innovation with a range from 50 kW to a maximum of 200 kW. This means that we now also cover the power range requested by customers for applications that require a higher electrical output. As the new solution is based on hydrogen  the maintenance requirement for customers is reduced while there are no emissions(1) during operation.""SFC Energy displays broad portfolio of power generation solutions for worldwide useWith over 200 000 expected visitors from all over the world  HANNOVER MESSE is the most important fair for the German industry.

Across the ocean  Paris  the thrumming heart of the West  providing generations of inspiration for avant-garde culture and romance.Two soulful cities whose stories are inextricable from the iconic rivers that flow through their midst – in Paris  the Seine and in Shanghai  the Suzhou Creek that merges into the Huangpu River. These waterways were the genesis of each city  connecting people  travelers  and trade. The cities grew around them while their destinies  characters  and prosperity were shaped by the powerful rivers that inspired them.Two world-class cities that have also been intrinsic to the heritage and progress of Accor. Paris  the founding and global headquarters of Accor since the 1960s; and Shanghai  the head office of Accor Greater China since the 1980s.With so much history and significance  Accor was keen to participate in the Our Water 2023-2024 Dialogue  Shanghai x Paris. As part of a five-year  multi-city series led by the Information Office of the Municipality of Shanghai  the first season of Our Water focused on the relationship  commonalities  and opportunities between Shanghai and Paris  with emphasis on riverside governance and waterfront development along the Suzhou Creek and the Seine.The series of cross-cultural exchanges between Shanghai and Paris representatives began in September 2023  and recently culminated at the Palais Brongniart  Paris  on April 18 2024  with a theme of ""Our Water: To A Boundless Future”. Participants included government officials  artists  writers  scholars  and business leaders engaged in discussions around urban renewal  ecological governance  sustainable development  and cultural innovation.Our rivers and waterways provide connection – not only between places  but between cultures  civilizations  and people. As a global hospitality leader headquartered in Paris  with our Greater China team based in Shanghai  and an ever-growing presence of hotels welcoming visitors to both cities  Accor a vested interest in keeping our riverside communities healthy and flourishing. We have been especially pleased to take part in the Our Water – Shanghai x Paris series this year  as China and France celebrate our longstanding relationship together  embracing our shared values for a world enriched by diversity  peace  and sustainability. Gary Rosen  CEO  Accor Greater China  at the Paris ForumAs the leading French hospitality group in China  the Shanghai x Paris segment of Our Water comes at a particularly relevant time for Accor. 2024 marks the 60th anniversary of the formal establishment of diplomatic relations between China and France. It is also the China-France Year of Culture and Tourism  as well as the 60th anniversary of Sofitel Hotels & Resorts – the world’s first international luxury hotel brand originating from France  and Accor’s ambassador of modern French style and art-de-vivre around the world.Sofitel has a strong appeal among Chinese travelers  who appreciate its refined sense of modern luxury and its masterful blending of Chinese and French cultures in a beautiful and harmonious way. Sofitel destinations are hosting multiple Sino-French celebrations and engaging in unique partnerships throughout the year to bring authentic cultural and entertaining experiences to its guests  featuring the arts  food & wine  and more.The upcoming Olympic & Paralympic Games Paris 2024 presents yet another opportunity for meaningful Sino-French exchange this year. As an Official Sponsor  Accor’s presence at the Games reflects the company’s vision and commitment to experience-based hospitality. Across Paris  Accor’s hotel teams will be eagerly welcoming Chinese guests and enthusiastic ALL-Accor Live Limitless members for an unforgettable Olympic experience.The Our Water 2023-2024 Intercultural Dialogue  Shanghai x Paris perfectly aligns with Accor’s support for the preservation of natural resources and the environment in each of its destinations. As an industry leader and pioneer in sustainable hospitality  Accor hascommitted to achieving Net Zero carbon emissions by 2050 in line with the Paris Agreement and engaging in absolute reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Accor’s approach builds on its commitment to contribute to a “Nature Positive” world  acting to preserve and use natural resources more responsibly  continuing to anchor its hotels in their local ecosystems  and protecting natural ecosystems and biodiversity.For more than 40 years  Accor has based its Chinese team in Shanghai where it actively partners with China’s leading companies to further the development and sustainability of the hospitality industry. Over the years  several Sino-French collaborations have been supportive of these efforts. In 2019  Accor signed a strategic partnership with Alibaba at the China France Economic Summit; and in 2023  Accor and Jin Jiang signed a hospitality sustainability partnership at the fifth meeting of the Council of China-France Entrepreneurs. Both signing events were held in the presence of French President Emmanuel Macron and Chinese President Xi Jinping.It was clear to Accor even in 1985 that Shanghai would play a pivotal role among the Chinese tourism market and to this day it continues to be one of Accor’s top priority markets  said Mr. Rosen. Shanghai is an ideal home base for Accor in Greater China. Shanghai is where we test our ideas  pilot our initiatives  and gather our teams. Shanghai is also quite often the first point of entry for visitors to China  a gateway to all that the country has to offer. It is a great honor to welcome these guests to our hotels across Shanghai  giving them a warm first impression of the city.Accor’s presence in Shanghaicontinues to deepen  thanks to having one of the most diverse brand portfolios in the world. Presently  Accor has more than 50 Accor hotels in Shanghai  under world-renowned brands such as Fairmont  Sofitel  Pullman  Swissôtel  Grand Mercure  Handwritten  Novotel  Mercure  ibis  and ibis Styles. With a strong development pipeline  the next few years will bring many more Accor hotels to fruition  including more Sino-French collaborations such as Sofitel Shanghai North Bund (in May 2024) and Sofitel Shanghai South Hotel (in 2025).Accor continues to support Shanghai’s ambitious plans for growth  by further developing and growing our existing hospitality brands  by continuing to introduce new brands into this dynamic market  and by leveraging our Sino-French heritage  said Mr. Rosen. We will also continue to make hospitality experiences for Chinese travelers exciting and innovative with more digital capabilities  enhancements to our lifestyle loyalty program ALL – Accor Live Limitless  and leading the hospitality industry with our ESG commitments and sustainability initiatives. We like to say that hospitality is a blessed industry  and at Accor we feel especially fortunate to be rooted in both the French and Chinese cultures  it really is the best of both worlds.About Accor  a world-leading hospitality groupAccor is a world leading hospitality group offering experiences across more than 110 countries in 5 500 properties  10 000 food & beverage venues  wellness facilities or flexible workspaces.

This significant development provides protection to Mithra's activities from creditors and installs court-designated trustees to oversee negotiations with potential bidders. The objective is to select the best offer while safeguarding the interests of the company  its creditors  and its employees.Additionally  Mithra's application for judicial reorganization proceedings to restructure the debt of Novalon SA  its complex therapeutics business  has been approved by the Liege Company Court. This procedure involves reaching an amicable agreement with some creditors and implementing a court-sanctioned debt-restructuring plan therewith. The aim is to ensure the financial stability of Novalon SA  reach an agreement with those selected creditors  and maintain operational continuity for the business. The duration of the protection measures is two months  starting from the Court’s ruling date  until 19 June 2024. The target date for the monetization of the other Mithra subsidiaries (i.e.  Estetra SRL  Mithra R&D  Neuralis) and the Mithra Group remains unchanged with the committed bridge loan facility covering operations until 30 April 2024 with the option to extend into May.These court protection measures mark significant milestones in Mithra's on-going monetization process and underscore the company's commitment to maximizing value for all stakeholders. These protection measures apply to the two aforementioned Mithra subsidiary companies and not to the Mithra group. By securing these measures  Mithra can navigate the process effectively while prioritizing the interests of its employees  creditors  other stakeholders  and the company as a whole.Mithra will continue to work closely with the engaged investment banks  the appointed advisors  potential buyers  and the court-appointed experts to execute these protection measures effectively and achieve optimal outcomes for all stakeholders.About MithraMithra Pharmaceuticals SA (Euronext: MITRA) is a Belgian biopharmaceutical company dedicated to transforming women’s health by offering new choices through innovation  with a particular focus on contraception and menopause.

In detail  the Defence/Space segment remains the leading business segment  with revenues of €7.7m. Still buoyed by strong demand and multi-year contracts  the dynamic of this segment is not constant from one quarter to the next and marks a slight pause in Q1 (-1.8%) compared with Q1 2023.OEM manufacturing activities for the medical sector  previously included in the Industrial and Scientific segment  are growing in importance  notably because of the integration of Convergent. They are now isolated within a separate segment: revenues for the Medical Photonics segment amounted to €4.0m in Q1  compared with €0.7m in Q1 2023.The Industrial and Scientific segment  which has consequently been restated for OEM medical activities  posted sales of €5.5m in Q1  up 16%.The Lidar segment has now been renamed ""Environment  Topography  Security - ETS"" in order to provide a consistent breakdown by application market for all segments. Sales in this segment for Q1 came to €3.5m  down 33%. In addition to a high basis for comparison  this decline is explained by the postponement of customer budgets dependent on public funding. In a market where demand remains strong  driven in particular by investment in the ecological transition  these deferrals should be made up during 2024.The Medical division grew by 3.7% (+5.7% at constant exchange rates) to €23.3 million. The regulatory and administrative hurdles identified at the end of 2023 are gradually being overcome  but marketing authorisations for new products in the USA and Asia will be issued during the year. The expected catch-up on delayed sales at the end of 2023 will therefore be spread over 2024. The breakdown of sales in the 1st quarter is 21% for diagnostic equipment and 79% for treatment products.By GeographyThe breakdown of sales by geographical area is as follows:Q1 Revenues (€m) Photonics Change vs 2023 Medical Change vs 2023 EMEA 11.9 +22% 8.1 +8% Americas 2.9 -15% 6.5 +4% APAC 3.5 -12% 6.3 -5% Rest of the world 2.3 +82% 2.4 +14% Total 20.6 +12% 23.3 +4%Données non auditéesThe Photonics division's strong growth in Europe was driven in particular by the Swedish and Italian subsidiaries. The decline in the Photonics division in the Americas and Asia-Pacific is linked to the effect of overstocking  which should be absorbed in 2024. In China  the Medical division was still experiencing the last effects of administrative blockages  which have now been fully lifted.OutlookThanks to its diversified positioning in markets where its technological leadership is recognised  LUMIBIRD is in a position to seek growth in its most buoyant markets. With the gradual lifting of the few obstacles encountered at the end of 2023 and the ramp-up of new defence contracts  the Group is on a strong growth trajectory and has confirmed its target of organic growth of at least 8% for 2024.Next dates: Annual General Meeting  29/04/2024Capital Market Day  21/05/2024 (12:30-17:30)LUMIBIRD is one of the world's leading laser specialists.

Description of the main elements of the Group's internal control and risk management systems associated with the financial reporting processThe Board is responsible for ensuring financial reporting process is subject to adequate control and has laid down instructions and guidelines on its own works as well as for the executive personnel on day-to-day operations and ongoing financial monitoring. The Board carries out a review of the Group's most significant risk areas in every six months and performs an annual review of its internal control systems. The Audit Committee assists the Board relating to the efficiencies of the Group's internal control over the financial reporting process; the effectiveness of the Group's risk management policies; and the qualifications and independence of the external auditor.The Group adopts a uniform generally accepted accounting practice in the preparation of financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries. The internal control systems identified in the financial reporting process are primarily designed to mitigate the risks including financial reporting risk  compliance-related risk  fraud risk  and risk on financial-accounting-related IT systems. The control procedures mainly include authorizations  segregation of duties  reconciliations  management review and IT controls over financial- accounting-related IT systems. To ensure adequate and effective internal control on financial reporting process is adopted and implemented  key control procedures are ongoing monitored by the executive personnel  regularly assessed by the Board and the Audit Committee and annually reviewed by the external professionals. 2Jinhui Shipping and Transportation Company Limited Corporate Governance Report 2023 (Extracted from Annual Report 2023) Provision in the Company's Memorandum of Association governing general meetingsThe Company's Memorandum of Association and Bye-Laws laid down the shareholders' right proceedings at general meetings  voting rights  proxies  transfer of shares  and also the rules governing the alteration or amendment to bye-laws and memorandum of association.

Mandate that gives the Board the right to issue new shares and provision in the Company's Bye-Laws that gives the Board the right to decide on share repurchasesThere is an existing general mandate in place that gives the Board the power to issue  allot and dispose of shares of the Company not exceeding the aggregate of 30% of the issued share capital of the Company on the date of the resolution.

The provision in the Company's Bye-Law 2 giving the Board the right to issue new shares.The provision in the Company's Bye-Law 3 giving the Board the right to purchase its shares as the Board shall think fit. In view of the increasingly volatile nature of today's financial markets  the Board shall make timely decision on the purchase of its shares according to the then prevailing market conditions to generate the most value for shareholders of the Company. 4Jinhui Shipping and Transportation Company Limited Corporate Governance Report 2023 (Extracted from Annual Report 2023) NORWEGIAN CODE OF PRACTICE FOR CORPORATE GOVERNANCE The section numbers mentioned below refer to the fifteen sections under the Norwegian Code of Practice. Section 1 Implementation and reporting on corporate governance Jinhui Shipping has applied and followed the principles as set out in the Norwegian Code of Practice. The corporate governance report of 2023 covered every section of Norwegian Code of Practice with the description of our conformance throughout the year and the explanation of the reasons for the deviations. Section 2 Business The objectives of Jinhui Shipping are set out in its Memorandum of Association  which include the businesses of  inter alia: acting and performing all the functions of a holding company;acting as ship owners  managers  operators and agents; andacquiring  owning  selling  chartering  repairing or dealing in ships. The Group's main objectives  strategies and risk profiles for our businesses are discussed in ""Strategies and Business Profile"" on pages 5 to 7 and in the section of Risk Management in ""Directors' Report"" on pages 60 to 62 in JST 2023 Annual Report. 5Jinhui Shipping and Transportation Company Limited Corporate Governance Report 2023 (Extracted from Annual Report 2023) The Company has promulgated a set of Company Code  which sets out the corporate standards and practices used by the Group to direct and manage its business affairs. The Company Code also includes corporate social responsibility guidelines and ethical guidelines and is prepared and updated by referencing to the principles set out in the Norwegian Code of Practice and other applicable rules and regulations. In addition to formalizing existing corporate governance principles and practices  the Company Code also serves the purpose of assimilating existing practices with benchmarks prescribed by the Norwegian Code of Practice and ultimately ensuring high transparency and accountability to the Company's shareholders. The directors and employees of Jinhui Shipping are subject to a range of rules laid down by legislation and regulations  as well as the Company Code and rules and ethical values and guidelines described in the staff handbooks. Section 3-3c of the Norwegian Accounting Act is relevant for Norwegian companies and also for third country issuers that have taxable operations in Norway. The Company did not present social responsibility statement as required under Section 3-3c of the Norwegian Accounting Act as the Company is incorporated in Bermuda and does not have any taxable operations in Norway. Nevertheless  we include the Company's principles on material social responsibility matters related to external environment  working environment  and employees' right and equal treatment in the Directors' report. We also commit to conduct our business in a responsible  ethical and lawful manner and complied applicable rules and regulations in our business practices. Jinhui Shipping shall maximize shareholders' values in a sustainable manner by increasing the Company's equity value and distributing dividends to shareholders and the Board evaluates the objectives  strategies and risk profiles annually. Section 3 Equity and dividends Equity Jinhui Shipping's capital adequacy is kept under constant review in relation to its objectives  strategies and risk profile. As at 31 December 2023  the Group's total equity was US$349 930 000  accounting for 72% of its consolidated total assets. The Board considers the present equity structure to be satisfactory. 6Jinhui Shipping and Transportation Company Limited Corporate Governance Report 2023 (Extracted from Annual Report 2023) Dividend policy The Company may declare and distribute dividends to the shareholders of the Company. Our policy aims to provide stable and consistent dividends with steady growth when supported by our earnings whilst ensuring that sufficient financial resources can be maintained to fund our business growth. In addition  the amount and timing of any dividend distributions in the future will depend  among other things  on our compliance with covenants in our credit facilities  earnings  financial condition  cash position  Bermuda law affecting the dividend distributions  restrictions in our financing agreements and other factors. As dry bulk shipping market is cyclic and volatile  it's particularly challenging to establish a clear and predictable dividend policy. There can be no assurance that a dividend will be proposed or declared in any given year. The Board has resolved not to recommend the payment of any interim / final dividend for the year. The dividend policy will be regularly assessed by the Board and will depend  among other things  on the Group's financial obligations  leverage  liquidity and capital resources  and the market conditions. During the year  there was no proposal for the Board to be given any mandate to approve the distribution of dividends. Increase in share capital At the 2023 Annual General Meeting of the Company  a general mandate had been granted to the directors of the Company to increase not exceeding the aggregate of 30% of the issued share capital of the Company which would be valid until the earlier of the date of the next annual general meeting or otherwise revoked or determined by shareholders at a general meeting of the Company. No shares were being issued under this authorization in 2023. According to the Norwegian Code of Practice  the mandate granted to the board of directors to increase the company's share capital should be restricted to defined purposes. In view of the increasingly volatile nature of today's financial markets  the Board believes having a general mandate in place enables the Company to respond swiftly to the then prevailing market conditions should an equity fund raising exercise be determined to be the appropriate funding channel and proposes this general mandate at the forthcoming annual general meeting. 7Jinhui Shipping and Transportation Company Limited Corporate Governance Report 2023 (Extracted from Annual Report 2023) Purchase of own shares The provision in the Company's Bye-Law 3 giving the Board the right to purchase its shares as the Board shall think fit. In view of the increasingly volatile nature of today's financial markets  the Board shall make timely decision on the purchase of its shares according to the then prevailing market conditions to generate the most value for shareholders of the Company. Section 4 Equal treatment of shareholders Equal treatment of shareholders Jinhui Shipping has one class of shares in issue. All shares have equal voting rights. There are provisions in the Company's Bye-Law 4 in relation to shareholder's voting rights. Share issues According to the Company's Bye-Law 4.3  the shareholders shall have the first and preferential right to subscribe for and be allotted any shares of the Company proposed to be issued in proportion to the number of shares held by them  unless the Company by special resolution otherwise decides to waive the shareholders' preferential rights in respect of a particular issue of shares or generally for any period not exceeding five years. In the event of an increase in share capital where the Board resolves to carry out an increase in share capital on the basis of a mandate granted to the Board that waives the pre-emption rights of existing shareholders  the justification will be publicly disclosed in a stock exchange announcement issued in connection with the increase in share capital. No shares were being issued in 2023. Transactions in its own shares Jinhui Shipping's shares are liquid. In the event the Company carries out transactions in its own shares  it would only carry out such transactions either through the stock exchange or at prevailing stock exchange prices if carried out in any other way. If there is limited liquidity in the Company's shares  the Company would consider other ways to ensure equal treatment of all shareholders. No transactions in shares were being carried out by the Company in 2023. 8Jinhui Shipping and Transportation Company Limited Corporate Governance Report 2023 (Extracted from Annual Report 2023) Section 5 Shares and negotiability Jinhui Shipping's shares are freely traded in the Oslo Stock Exchange (Oslo Børs). The Company's shares are registered shares with its shareholders register located at Bermuda. Shareholders of the Company may transfer their shares by an instrument of transfer in the usual common form or in such form as decided by the Board. In general  all shares are freely negotiable. However  the Board may deny the transfer of shares according to the Bye-Law 11 of the Company. The Board has the option to decline to register the transfer of any share if the registration of such transfer would be likely to result in 50% or more of the aggregate issued share capital and the votes of the Company being held or owned directly or indirectly by a person or persons resident for tax purposes in Norway. The Board considers that it is appropriate to impose such restriction which protects the existing Norwegian shareholders from unexpected tax changes in Norway for the common interest of the Company and the shareholders. This type of restriction is common for Bermuda and other low-tax jurisdiction companies listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange (Oslo Børs). Section 6 General meetings Attendance by shareholders The Company provides detailed procedures and comprehensive information are distributed to shareholders to allow shareholders to form the view on all matters to be considered at the general meeting. Shareholders of the Company are entitled to attend shareholders' meeting in person or by proxy. Electronic meeting is not applicable as it would be contrary to the Bye-Laws of the Company.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance.

We show that circular single strand DNA templates can be efficiently delivered to HSPCs and enable unprecedented efficiency of gene insertion without compromising the viability  fitness and differentiation capacity of edited cells” commented Julien Valton  Ph.D.  Vice President of Gene Therapy at Cellectis.“We also illustrate a novel TALEN® mediated-DNA template insertion approach that rewires the natural ability of myeloid cells to cross the blood brain barrier to efficiently vectorize a genetically encoded-therapeutic protein to the brain. This approach is  by essence  versatile and could be used to vectorize an array of therapeutic proteins to the brain and potentially address multiple neurological disorders.”Poster presentation: Intron Editing of HSPC Enables Lineage-Specific Expression of TherapeuticsGene therapy using edited hematopoietic and progenitor stem cells (HSPCs) has the potential to provide a lifelong supply of genetically encoded therapeutics.Today  most therapies are impacted with the difficulty to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). The BBB is a continuous endothelial membrane that  along with pericytes and other components of the neurovascular unit  limits the entry of toxins  pathogens  protein and small molecules to the brain.Cellectis has developed a TALEN® mediated promoter-less intron editing technology that enables the expression of a therapeutic transgene exclusively by monocyte derived from edited HSPCs.The edited cells containing genetically encoded therapeutic proteins have the capacity to cross the blood-brain barrier and secrete the corresponding therapeutic within the brain.This novel editing approach is an important addition to the HSPC gene editing toolbox that might unlock new strategies for the treatment of metabolic and neurological diseases.Research data showed that:Intron editing can be performed within B-cell  T-cell  Monocyte-specific endogenous genes (CD20  CD4 and CD11b  respectively)Intron editing allows expression of transgenes in a lineage-specific manner without markedly impacting the expression of the endogenous gene targetedEditing of CD11b intron using a therapeutic transgene encoding IDUA (the enzyme missing in Type-1 Mucopolysaccharidosis patients) enables to restrict the expression of IDUA to the myeloid lineage.Edited HSPCs efficiently engraft in the bone-marrow of immunodeficient mice and differentiate into edited myeloid cells that can cross the BBB and populate the brain.The intron editing strategy described in this work is versatile and could be potentially used to vectorize multiple genetically encoded-therapeutic proteins to the brain and thus address multiple metabolic and neurological disorders.Title: Intron Editing of HSPC Enables Lineage-Specific Expression of TherapeuticsPresenter: Julien Valton  Ph.D.  Vice President Gene Therapy at CellectisSession Date/Time: May 5  2024 at 12PM ETSession Title: Gene Targeting and Gene Correction New TechnologiesPresentation Room: Exhibit HallFinal Abstract Number: 721Poster presentation: Circularization of Non-Viral Single-Strand DNA Template for Gene Correction and Gene Insertion Improves Editing Outcomes in HSPCsToday  most of the gene insertion approaches used to edit HSPCs ex vivo are hampered by the low efficiency of DNA template delivery into their nucleus.Cellectis has developed and optimized a novel gene editing process  leveraging the TALEN® technology and circular single strand DNA template delivery  enabling highly efficient gene insertion in HSPCs.Research data showed that:Non-viral single strand DNA delivery associated to TALEN® technology allows gene insertion in long-term repopulating hematopoietic stem cellsCircularization of the single strand DNA further increases the rates of gene insertion without impacting cellular viability and fitness of HSPCs  facilitating the development of next generation of ex vivo cell therapiesTitle: Circularization of Non-Viral Single-Strand DNA Template for Gene Correction and Gene Insertion Improves Editing Outcomes in HSPCsPresenter: Alex Boyne  Gene Editing Platform Manager at CellectisSession Date/Time: May 9  2024 at 12PM ETSession Title: Nonviral Therapeutic Gene Delivery and Synthetic/Molecular ConjugatesPresentation Room: Exhibit HallFinal Abstract Number: 1235Full abstracts and poster presentations will be available on Cellectis’ website following the event: https://www.cellectis.com/en/investors/scientific-presentations/About CellectisCellectis is a clinical-stage biotechnology company using its pioneering gene-editing platform to develop life-saving cell and gene therapies.

The survey covers a sample representing more than half of the world's population  distributed across five continents.The second edition provides a unique insight into the understanding of the consequences of climate change by people around the world. They express growing concern for their health and perceive a threat to their living conditions in the face of environmental challenges. Aware of these dangers  people worldwide are calling for action.To address these challenges  populations assert their readiness to accept necessary changes to scale up existing solutions to combat climate change and pollution. Their desire to act is motivated by the need to protect against environmental and climate crises. They consider that the cost of inaction will be much higher than that of action.Find the full results for France and Worldwide at this linkKey Global Results97% of the world's inhabitants believe that health is the primary concern when it comes to local decisions on water  waste  and energy  ahead of the final price.64% of the world's inhabitants feel vulnerable to health risks caused by climate change.

Faced with the climate challenge  radical action and ecological pause collide. Both present major social  economic  and ecological risks. Veolia offers a third way: ecology that transforms our economies to protect populations. Ecological transformation cannot  and must not  occur without the citizens of the world. Listening helps to understand the concerns and needs of everyone  to identify the levers of change that are not only acceptable but desirable  and to find meaning and motivation for change in building a sustainable future "" said Estelle Brachlianoff  CEO of Veolia. ""The results of the second edition of the Barometer of Ecological Transformation testify to a global public opinion firmly focused on action. There is a high level of expectation for the protection of our health through the elimination of pollution and the protection of our territories from extreme climatic phenomena. This is the lesson that will guide our actions in the years to come.""For Bernard SananÃ¨s  President of the research and consulting institute Elabe:""While voices are rising in many countries calling for an ecological pause  the second edition of the barometer of ecological transformation reveals a global public opinion mostly convinced that inaction will cost humanity more than the investments necessary for ecological transition. Across all continents  populations fear a deterioration of their living conditions and are afraid of falling ill due to pollution. In 18 months  the failure of ecological imagination and the perceived lack of concrete results have pushed many countries into fatalism. But everywhere  the protection of health has become a powerful lever to create a desire for ecology and to accept behavior changes or the additional costs of ecological solutions.""here or remove ads . 3rd party Ad.

The survey covers a sample representing more than half of the world's population  distributed across five continents.The second edition provides a unique insight into the understanding of the consequences of climate change by people around the world. They express growing concern for their health and perceive a threat to their living conditions in the face of environmental challenges. Aware of these dangers  people worldwide are calling for action.To address these challenges  populations assert their readiness to accept necessary changes to scale up existing solutions to combat climate change and pollution. Their desire to act is motivated by the need to protect against environmental and climate crises. They consider that the cost of inaction will be much higher than that of action.*** Find the full results for France and Worldwide at this link ***Key Global Results97% of the world's inhabitants believe that health is the primary concern when it comes to local decisions on water  waste  and energy  ahead of the final price.64% of the world’s inhabitants feel vulnerable to health risks caused by climate change. These health risks manifest in increased infectious diseases  pollution  decreased quality of food  and mental health issues.67% of the world’s inhabitants believe that a solution that promotes the preservation of their health would encourage them to change their habits or accept a slightly higher cost.66% of the world’s inhabitants are convinced that inaction will cost humanity more than ecological action.""We stand at a crossroads. Faced with the climate challenge  radical action and ecological pause collide. Both present major social  economic  and ecological risks. Veolia offers a third way: ecology that transforms our economies to protect populations. Ecological transformation cannot  and must not  occur without the citizens of the world. Listening helps to understand the concerns and needs of everyone  to identify the levers of change that are not only acceptable but desirable  and to find meaning and motivation for change in building a sustainable future "" said Estelle Brachlianoff  CEO of Veolia. ""The results of the second edition of the Barometer of Ecological Transformation testify to a global public opinion firmly focused on action. There is a high level of expectation for the protection of our health through the elimination of pollution and the protection of our territories from extreme climatic phenomena. This is the lesson that will guide our actions in the years to come.""For Bernard Sananès  President of the research and consulting institute Elabe:""While voices are rising in many countries calling for an ecological pause  the second edition of the barometer of ecological transformation reveals a global public opinion mostly convinced that inaction will cost humanity more than the investments necessary for ecological transition. Across all continents  populations fear a deterioration of their living conditions and are afraid of falling ill due to pollution. In 18 months  the failure of ecological imagination and the perceived lack of concrete results have pushed many countries into fatalism. But everywhere  the protection of health has become a powerful lever to create a desire for ecology and to accept behavior changes or the additional costs of ecological solutions.""▁▁▁ABOUT THE METHODOLOGYThe survey was conducted in 26 countries across 5 continents  reaching more than 29 500 individuals (between 1 000 and 2 000 per country). Countries were chosen for their demographic weight  their contribution to greenhouse gas emissions  and to ensure diversity in ecological political and cultural backgrounds. Overall  these countries represent nearly 60% of the world's population and 67% of global greenhouse gas emissions. The survey was conducted online from October 17 to December 6  2023. For each of the 26 countries  a representative sample of residents aged 18 and over was gathered. Frequency: the barometer is published every 18 months (allowing for long-term evolution of representations  opinions  and behaviors).▁▁▁ABOUT ELABEElabe is an independent research and consulting firm founded in 2015 by Bernard Sananès.

The financial charges of 1 674 652 euro in 2023 mainly relate to the debt related interest expenses. In 2022  the financial charges of 1 549 353 euro mainly relate to attributed interest charges on the subordinated loan agreements concluded at the end of July 2020 and amended in December 2021 and interest charges on the secured loan facility agreement with Kreos. The losses before taxes amount in 2023 to 29 341 977 euro. The Company has closed its annual accounts with respect to the financial year 2023 with a loss of 29 783 232 euro. Statutory and non-distributable reserves The Company has a share capital of 2 926 296 euro. The Company has 686 404 euro of non-distributable reserves. As the Company has closed its annual accounts with respect to the past financial year with a loss  the Company is not legally obliged to reserve additional amounts. Result allocation The Board of Directors proposes to carry forward the loss for the financial year to the next financial year. 2 | P a g e3 Principles of financial reporting and going concern The Company is still in the development phase for its alfapump® and DSR® programs  including the execution of clinical trials and submission / review of applications in order to achieve regulatory marketing approvals for these products. This entails various risks and uncertainties  including but not limited to the uncertainty of the development and regulatory review process and the timing of achieving profitability. The Company's ability to continue operations also depends on its ability to raise additional capital and to refinance existing debt  in order to fund operations and assure the solvency of the Company until revenues reach a level to sustain positive cash flows. The impact of macroeconomic conditions and geopolitical situation in Ukraine and the Middle East on the Company's ability to secure additional financing rounds or undertake capital market transactions remains unclear at this point in time and will remain under review by the Executive Management and the Board of Directors. The above conditions indicate the existence of material uncertainties  which may also cast significant doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The Statement of Financial Position as at 31 December 2023 shows a negative equity in the amount of EUR 3.83 million and ending cash balance of EUR 2.3 million. The Company will continue to require additional financing in the near future and in that respect already executed a EUR 3.0 million Investor Loan Agreement in February 2024 with Partners in Equity and Rosetta Capital and raised EUR 11.5 million gross proceeds in March 2024 in a private equity placement via an accelerated book-build offering disclosed in section 4 ""Significant events after the Reporting Period"" below. Together with existing cash resources  the net proceeds from these financing activities are expected to extend the current cash runway of the Company to the end of Q3 2024. Based on the above condition  the Executive Management and the Board of Directors made an assessment of the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. Several measures have already been carried out in order to reduce expenditures  including: alfapump program: The Board of Directors strongly believes that pre-market approval (""PMA"") approval of the alfapump is a key value inflection point for the Company and has decided to prioritize its resources on reaching this important milestone. A number of other alfapump-related activities have been delayed or halted  including termination of all commercial activities in Europe  which resulted in a significant reduction in personnel in all countries  andpre-market approval (""PMA"") approval of the alfapump is a key value inflection point for the Company and has decided to prioritize its resources on reaching this important milestone. A number of other alfapump-related activities have been delayed or halted  including termination of all commercial activities in Europe  which resulted in a significant reduction in personnel in all countries  and Heart Failure/DSR: Delaying the randomized phase of the MOJAVE clinical study until after the alfapump pre- market approval (""PMA"") approval. The Company is also assessing to what extent partnerships or licensing arrangements could be entered into regarding its alfapump and DSR programs in order to support development and commercialisation. While on the date hereof no concrete plans are on the table  the Company continuously engages with potential partners  which could also provide further funding to the Company's business. The Board of Directors believes that a combination of one or more of the foregoing measures will help in addressing the Company's liquidity and funding structure. It also believes that these may further help in finding additional equity and/or debt financing from existing and/or new investors  as well as to renegotiate and/or refinance existing debt financing arrangements. Efforts in that respect are ongoing continuously. The Company has also control over its spending  and management can timely and adequately reduce budgeted expenditures should this be necessary in the context of the Company's going concern and/or should it be necessary to have more time to obtain additional financing. The Executive Management and the Board of Directors remain confident about the strategic plan  which comprises additional financing measures including equity and/or other financing sources  and therefore consider the preparation of the present Consolidated Financial Statements on a going concern basis as appropriate. We also refer to section 4 Significant events after the reporting period below. Application of article 7:228 of the Belgian Companies and Associations Code The Board of Directors notes that at the occasion of the preparation of the statutory (non-consolidated) financial statements of the Company for the financial year ended 31 December 2023  it determined that the Company's (non- 3 | P a g econsolidated) accounting net assets (as defined in the Belgian Companies and Associations Code) were still below the thresholds of the articles 7:228 and 7:229 of the Belgian Companies and Associations Code. On 30 June 2023 the Company's (non-consolidated) accounting net assets had already fallen below the thresholds of the Articles 7:228 and 7:229 of the Belgian Companies and Associations Code. Based on the foregoing  the procedure set out in the article 7:228 of the Belgian Companies and Associations Code has been initiated with the extraordinary general shareholders' meeting of 10 November 2023 Consequently  the extraordinary general shareholders' meeting of the Company held on 10 November 2023 approved the proposal set out in the report prepared by the board of directors at the time in accordance with Article 7:228 of the Belgian Companies and Associations Code. Even with the March 2024 capital increase  the (non-consolidated) accounting net assets of the Company remain below the thresholds of Articles 7:228 and 7:229 of the Belgian Companies and Associations Code. For more information on the measures the Board of Directors has taken and proposes to take to redress the financial situation of the Company  and its proposal to continue the operations of the Company  reference is made to the relevant report of the Board of Directors submitted to the extraordinary general shareholders' meeting of 10 November 2023. Further measures were announced in a press release on 8 February 2024. 4 Significant events after the reporting period Restructuring program In February 2024  several additional measures have been carried out in order to reduce expenditures  including: alfapump program: The Board of Directors strongly believes that pre-market approval (""PMA"") approval of the alfapump is a key value inflection point for the Company and has decided to prioritize its resources on reaching this important milestone. A number of other alfapump-related activities have been delayed or halted  including termination of all commercial activities in Europe  which resulted in a significant reduction in personnel in all countries  andpre-market approval (""PMA"") approval of the alfapump is a key value inflection point for the Company and has decided to prioritize its resources on reaching this important milestone. A number of other alfapump-related activities have been delayed or halted  including termination of all commercial activities in Europe  which resulted in a significant reduction in personnel in all countries  and Heart Failure/DSR: Delaying the randomized phase of the MOJAVE clinical study until after the alfapump pre- market approval (""PMA"") approval. Additional secured investor financing of EUR 3.0 million In February 2024  the Company has obtained a Convertible Loan provided by major shareholders Partners in Equity and Rosetta Capital (each a ""Lender"") and is for an aggregate principal amount of EUR 3.0 million. The maturity date of the Convertible Loan is 30 September 2024. The principal amount and interest of the Convertible Loan can be converted by the Lenders for new shares of the Company at any time prior to the maturity date  at a conversion price equal to the lower of (i) arithmetic average of the daily volume weighted average trading price per share of the Company's shares traded on Euronext Brussels during the period of twenty (20) consecutive trading days ending on (and including) the third trading day before the date on which the Company has received the optional conversion exercise notice  minus a discount of 45%  and (ii) the issue price of the new shares issued by the Company at the occasion of the most recent future equity financing before receipt of the optional conversion exercise notice  minus a discount of 45%. The principal amount and interest of the Convertible Loans are mandatorily converted in the event of a future equity financing transaction by the Company for at least EUR 7.0 million. In case of a mandatory conversion  the conversion occurs at a conversion price equal to the issue price of the new shares in equity financing transaction  minus a discount of 45%. If the Company enters into a new convertible loan for a value of at least EUR 7.0 million and such new convertible loan includes conversion rights equivalent to the mandatory and optional equity conversion rights in the Convertible Loan (but with a discount of at least 25% instead of 45%)  all amounts outstanding under the Convertible Loan  plus a conversion fee of 33% of all amounts owed under the Convertible Loan  will be converted into the new convertible loan. In the event that the conditions for conversion for shares or for a new convertible loan have not been fulfilled by the maturity date  the loans will be repayable in cash (subject to certain subordination provisions). The loans bear interest of 15% per annum  which shall be compounded on a monthly basis. In case of conversion  the minimum amount to be converted for new shares or a new convertible loan will in any event be EUR 300 000. The proceeds from the loan will be used to finance general working capital requirements. 4 | P a g eAs a consequence of the equity placement on 25 March 2024 (see below for more details)  the aggregate principal amounts and interests under this loan agreement will be mandatorily converted at the date of the annual shareholders' meeting into new shares (through a contribution in kind of payables) at a conversion price per share equal to the issue price in said equity financing transaction  minus a discount of 45%. Amendments to the existing loan agreements The Company's lenders have also agreed to a number of measures to support the goal of obtaining PMA approval through enabling the focus of the Company's cash resources on alfapump PMA approval instead of debt service payments. These measures include the postponement of all repayments under the existing loan agreements and a new conversion feature for 30% of the outstanding loans of funds and accounts managed by BlackRock  Inc. and its affiliates (""BlackRock""). Amendment to the senior debt agreements with Kreos Capital VII (UK) Limited In February 2024  the Company also entered into an agreement in relation to the amendment of certain repayment and other terms of the EUR 10 000 000 loan with Kreos Capital VII (UK) Limited (together with its affiliates ""Kreos""  and the ""Kreos Loan"").1 Subject to finalization of definitive agreements  the main amendments to the Kreos Loan can be summarized as follows: Payment holiday: Suspension of the repayment of any principal or interest amounts under the Kreos Loan until the earlier of (i) three months following the date on which the Company has obtained a PMA decision for the alfapump by the US FDA (irrespective whether such decision is positive or otherwise)  (ii) date on which the Company has obtained a PMA approval for the alfapump by the US FDA and has completed an equity raise of at least EUR 20.0 million  and (iii) 31 December 2024.Maturity date extension: If the Company (i) completes an equity raise resulting in additional cash proceeds ofthe higher of: (x) EUR 30.0 million  and; (y) such amount as required to provide the Company with cash runway until 31 March 2026 determined by reference to a budget approved by the board at the time of such equity raise  and (ii) receives a PMA approval for alfapump before the payment resumption date  the maturity date of the Kreos Loan would be extended from 30 September 2025 to March 2026.the higher of: (x) EUR 30.0 million  and; (y) such amount as required to provide the Company with cash runway until 31 March 2026 determined by reference to a budget approved by the board at the time of such equity raise  and (ii) receives a PMA approval for alfapump before the payment resumption date  the maturity date of the Kreos Loan would be extended from 30 September 2025 to March 2026.

The amended exercise price would be equal to the lower of (i) the applicable loan conversion price under the Convertible Loan agreement with Partners in Equity and Rosetta Capital  and (ii) the issue price in any other future equity or equity linked investment in the Company completed prior to the exercise of the relevant warrants.Contractual restrictions: The amendments set out in the agreement with Kreos are conditional upon  among other things  the Company's plans to focus on the alfapump business and to pause the DSR product. Amendment to the subordinated debt agreements with PMV/z-leningen (currently known as PMV-Standaardleningen)  Belfius Insurance and Sensinnovat NV The Company also entered into amendments in relation to (i) the EUR 4 300 000 partially convertible loan with PMV Standaardleningen NV (formerly known as PMV/z Leningen NV) (the ""PMV Loan"")  (ii) the EUR 2 000 000 loan with Belfius Insurance NV (the ""Belfius Loan"")  and (iii) the EUR 400 000 loan with Sensinnovat BV (the ""Sensinnovat Loan"").

Equity placement The Company successfully raised an amount of EUR 11.5 million in gross proceeds by means of a private placement of new shares via an accelerated bookbuild offering of 7 666 667 new shares (being approximately 27.15% of the Company's current outstanding shares) at an issue price of EUR 1.50 per new share (the ""Offering""). As a consequence  the Company's share capital has increased on 25 March 2024 from EUR 2 926 295.90 to EUR 3 720 562.60 and the number of issued and outstanding shares has increased from 28 242 753 to 35 909 420 shares  through the issuance of a total of 7 666 667 new shares.

It is reminded that similar convertible bonds were issued by the Issuer to Advantech on October 13  2023 (see the press release of the Issuer dated October 16  2023).After the approval of the relevant resolution by the Issuer's shareholders' meeting  and simultaneously with the signing of the documentation pertaining to the Block Trade  Advantech and the Issuer would enter into a convertible bonds issuance agreement for the issuance of the two (2) tranches of convertible bonds  as follows:issuance of convertible bonds having an aggregate principal amount of €2 500 000  upon the closing of the Block Trade (the “First Tranche”);issuance of convertible bonds having an aggregate principal amount of €2 500 000  upon the completion of the Tender Offer or on an earlier date subject to Advantech's prior consent (the “Second Tranche”).Off-market acquisition of shares by AdvantechSimultaneously with the entry into the convertible bonds issuance agreement for the issuance of the two (2) tranches of convertible bonds  Advantech and Patrick Cathala would sign the documentation pertaining to the off-market acquisition by Advantech of all the 1 430 381 existing shares of the Issuer held by Patrick Cathala at a price per share of €6.31.As a result of the Block Trade  Advantech would hold at least 35.8% of the share capital of the Issuer.Upon completion of the Block Trade  Patrick Cathala would resign from his positions as Chairman of the board of directors and Chief Executive Officer of the Issuer and would be replaced by a representative of Advantech. However  Patrick Cathala would enter into a services agreement with the Issuer in order to perform a smooth transition with Advantech.Filing of the draft Tender OfferSubject to the completion of the Block Trade  Advantech would file the draft Tender Offer with the AMF for all remaining outstanding shares of the Issuer [2]  on the same financial terms as the Block Trade  i.e.  €6.31 per share (the “Tender Offer Price”).The Tender Offer Price of €6.31 per share represents a premium of approximately:63.05% of the closing price of the shares as at April 17  2024 (i.e.  €3.87);48.83 % of the volume weighted average price of the shares observed over the three months preceding April 17  2024 (i.e.  €4.24); and105.54% of the volume weighted average price of the shares observed over the six months preceding April 17  2024 (i.e.  €3.07).The opening of the Tender Offer shall be subject to the AMF's declaration of conformity (déclaration de conformité).Should the threshold of 90% of the share capital and voting rights be crossed at the end of the Tender Offer  Advantech would request the implementation of a squeeze-out procedure of the shares of the Issuer.Next steps of the proposed TransactionThe Parties will negotiate in good faith the terms and conditions of the Transaction and the definitive documentation to be entered into by the Parties.The board of directors of the Issuer will appoint an independent expert to draw up a report (including a fairness opinion) on the financial terms of the Tender Offer  including in the event of a squeeze-out procedure  in accordance with the provisions of the AMF general regulation. Since the Issuer will not be able to set up an ad hoc committee  it will submit to the AMF the identity of the independent expert it is considering appointing.The Issuer's shareholder's meeting is expected to be convened shortly in order to approve the issuance of the First Tranche and the Second Tranche  and to be held no later thanJune 15  2024 on first convening.The signature of the definitive documentation will only take place once the board of directors of Advantech shall have granted its approval to the Transaction  and once the information and consultation procedure of the Issuer's social and economic committee  which will be initiated as soon as possible  shall have been completed.The subscription to the First Tranche by Advantech and the completion of the Block Trade are expected to take place prior to the end of the second quarter of 2024  and the filing of the Tender Offer shortly thereafter.The completion of the Block Trade will not be subject to obtaining any regulatory approvals.The market will be kept informed of the progress of discussions between the Parties  and further announcements will be made in due course  as appropriate.AdvisorsThe Issuer's financial advisors for the Transaction are TP ICAP  with Hoche Avocats acting as legal advisor.Jeantet AARPI and LCS & Partners are acting as legal advisors of Advantech for the Transaction.About the AURES GroupFounded in 1989 and listed on Euronext Growth  AURES Technologies is an IT developer and manufacturer of hardware (POS  Mobile POS & KIOSK)  digital and application solutions for all segments of the POS market.The AURES Group has a global presence  with its headquarters in France and subsidiaries in the UK  Germany  Australia  the US and Tunisia  as well as a network of partners  distributors and resellers in over 60 other countries.ISIN: FR 0013183589Financial information : Sabine De Vuystwww.aures.com[1] Corresponding to 35.8% of the share capital of the Issuer as at April 17  2024.[2] Pursuant to the provisions of Article 234-2 of the AMF general regulation  as a result of the crossing of the threshold of 30% of the share capital and voting rights of the Issuer by Advantech in the framework of the completion of the Block Trade.This publication embed ""🔒 Actusnews SECURITY MASTER "".- SECURITY MASTER Key: ymhplchsZmyammpqk8mWl2hjmGZoxWLHl5LGx5ZuZJecaXFmnWxoaZ2eZnFmlm1q- Check this key: https://www.security-master-key.com .Regulated information:Inside Information:- Operations of the issuer (acquisitions  salesÃ¢Â€Â¦) Full and original press release in PDF: https://www.actusnews.com/news/85184-20240421-negociations-exclusives-uk.pdfReceive by email the next press releases of the company by registering on www.actusnews.com   it's free© 2024 ActusNews",neutral,0.05,0.95,0.01,positive,0.71,0.25,0.04,True,English,"['ENTRY INTO', 'EXCLUSIVE NEGOCIATIONS', 'Aures Technologies', 'Autorité des marchés financiers', 'mandatory cash tender offer', 'convertible bonds issuance agreement', 'other key stakeholders', 'Chief Executive Officer', 'global sales systems', 'Smart Retail Solutions', 'similar convertible bonds', 'global retail market', 'aggregate principal amount', 'new convertible bonds', 'Tender Offer documentation', 'services agreement', 'new level', 'market acquisition', 'exclusive negotiations', 'Patrick Cathala', 'main shareholder', 'exclusivity undertaking', 'good faith', 'sole benefit', 'two (2) tranches', 'favorable welcome', 'independent expert', 'new ambitions', 'international footprint', 'technical achievements', 'leadership team', 'best interest', 'AIoT technologies', 'MC Chiang', 'Vice President', 'Service-IoT Group', 'press release', 'First Tranche', 'earlier date', 'prior consent', 'Second Tranche', 'definitive documentation', ""shareholders' meeting"", 'Block Trade', 'same price', 'conversion price', 'relevant resolution', '1,430,381 existing shares', 'one (1) share', 'share capital', 'AURES Group', 'Advantech Group', 'Monday', 'April', 'Lisses', 'France', 'Entry', 'launch', 'Issuer', 'founder', 'terms', 'conditions', 'transaction', 'filing', 'AMF', 'phase', 'Parties', 'board', 'directors', 'prejudice', 'review', 'opinion', 'submission', 'report', 'case', 'completion', 'Rationale', 'proposed', 'resources', 'reputation', 'differentiation', 'design', 'strength', 'quality', 'culmination', 'process', 'value', 'work', 'employees', 'clients', 'Chairman', 'product', 'manufacturing', 'integration', 'competitiveness', 'companies', 'progression', 'Description', 'parallel', 'right', 'October', 'approval', 'signing', 'closing', 'result', 'positions', 'representative', 'order']",2024-04-22,2024-04-23,marketscreener.com

The EC approval was granted based on results from two Phase 3 studies  BE HEARD I and BE HEARD II  which evaluated the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab in the treatment of moderate to severe HS.""The European Commission's approval of bimekizumab marks a significant milestone for the EU hidradenitis suppurativa community  particularly considering the limited treatment options currently available "" said Prof. Dr. Christos C. Zouboulis  President of the European Hidradenitis Suppurativa Foundation (EHSF) e.V. and Director of the Departments of Dermatology  Venereology  Allergology and Immunology  Städtisches Klinikum Dessau  Brandenburg Medical School  Germany. ""As a community  we strive to improve the management of hidradenitis suppurativa. Bimekizumab offers a promising new therapeutic option for moderate to severe disease  supported by Phase 3 evidence that demonstrated clinically meaningful and sustained responses over 48 weeks.""HS is a chronic  relapsing inflammatory skin disease that manifests as nodules  abscesses and pus-discharging fistulas  i.e.  channels leading out of the skin  typically in the armpits  groin  and buttocks.2 3 HS typically starts in early adulthood and affects approximately one percent of the population in most studied countries.2 3 HS is associated with significant co-morbidities and can have a profound negative effect on patients' quality of life.2 3""Hidradenitis suppurativa can have a devastating impact on people  especially those with moderate to severe disease. In addition to the physical symptoms  there can also be a considerable psychological burden for many people  resulting in a reduced quality of life and missing out on important life events "" said Barry McGrath  Ph.D.  Co-Founder of HS Ireland  an association for all people affected by hidradenitis suppurativa in Ireland. ""The possibility of a new treatment option to help people living with this disease is most welcome.""""We are proud to bring the first and only approved medicine targeting IL-17A and IL-17F to the hidradenitis suppurativa community. We believe that bimekizumab has the potential to transform care for people living with moderate to severe disease "" said Emmanuel Caeymaex  Executive Vice President  Immunology Solutions and Head of U.S. ""Today's approval signifies the expansion of bimekizumab to its fourth approved indication within the European Union. This milestone achievement underscores our unwavering commitment to raising standards of care across a spectrum of IL-17 mediated diseases.""Notes to editors:About BE HEARD I and BE HEARD II1BE HEARD I and BE HEARD II were multicenter  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled Phase 3 studies designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab in adults with moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (HS). The two studies had a combined enrolment of 1 014 adult patients with a diagnosis of moderate to severe HS. The primary endpoint in both studies was HiSCR50 at Week 16. A key secondary endpoint was HiSCR75 at Week 16. HiSCR50 and HiSCR75 are defined as at least either a 50 or 75 percent reduction from baseline in the total abscess and inflammatory nodule count  with no increase from baseline in abscess or draining tunnel count.Results from BE HEARD I and BE HEARD II showed that a significantly higher proportion of patients treated with bimekizumab versus placebo achieved a 50 percent or greater improvement in HS signs and symptoms at Week 16  as measured by HiSCR50  the primary endpoint in both trials. Bimekizumab treatment also resulted in clinically meaningful improvements in the ranked key secondary endpoint  HiSCR75 versus placebo at Week 16. Responses were maintained to Week 48. The safety profile of bimekizumab was consistent with safety data seen in previous trials with no new observed safety signals.About BIMZELX® (bimekizumab)BIMZELX® (bimekizumab) is a humanized monoclonal IgG1 antibody designed to selectively inhibit both interleukin 17A (IL-17A) and interleukin 17F (IL-17F)  two key cytokines driving inflammatory processes.1 4 The therapeutic indications in the EU are:1Plaque psoriasis: Bimekizumab is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy.Psoriatic arthritis: Bimekizumab  alone or in combination with methotrexate  is indicated for the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis in adults who have had an inadequate response or who have been intolerant to one or more disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs).Axial Spondyloarthritis: Bimekizumab is indicated for the treatment of adults with active non radiographic axial spondyloarthritis with objective signs of inflammation as indicated by elevated C reactive protein (CRP)  and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) who have responded inadequately or are intolerant to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)  and for the treatment of adults with active ankylosing spondylitis who have responded inadequately or are intolerant to conventional therapy.Hidradenitis suppurativa: Bimekizumab is indicated for the treatment of active moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (HS; acne inversa) in adults with an inadequate response to conventional systemic HS therapy.BIMZELX® ▼ (bimekizumab) EU/EEA* Important Safety Information1The most frequently reported adverse reactions with bimekizumab were upper respiratory tract infections (14.5%  14.6%  16.3%  8.8% in plaque psoriasis  psoriatic arthritis  axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) and hidradenitis suppurativa  respectively) and oral candidiasis (7.3%  2.3%  3.7%  5.6% in PSO  PsA  axSpA and HS  respectively). Common adverse reactions (≥1/100 to <1/10) were oral candidiasis  tinea infections  ear infections  herpes simplex infections  oropharyngeal candidiasis  gastroenteritis  folliculitis  vulvovaginal mycotic infection (including vulvovaginal candidiasis)  headache  rash  dermatitis and eczema  acne  injection site reactions  fatigue. Elderly may be more likely to experience certain adverse reactions such as oral candidiasis  dermatitis and eczema when using bimekizumab.Bimekizumab is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients and in patients with clinically important active infections (e.g. active tuberculosis).Bimekizumab may increase the risk of infections. Treatment with bimekizumab must not be initiated in patients with any clinically important active infection. Patients treated with bimekizumab should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms suggestive of an infection occur. If a patient develops an infection the patient should be carefully monitored. If the infection becomes serious or is not responding to standard therapy  treatment should be discontinued until the infection resolves. Prior to initiating treatment with bimekizumab  patients should be evaluated for tuberculosis (TB) infection. Bimekizumab should not be given in patients with active TB. Patients receiving bimekizumab should be monitored for signs and symptoms of active TB.Cases of new or exacerbations of inflammatory bowel disease have been reported with bimekizumab. Bimekizumab is not recommended in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. If a patient develops signs and symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease or experiences an exacerbation of pre-existing inflammatory bowel disease  bimekizumab should be discontinued and appropriate medical management should be initiated.Serious hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylactic reactions have been observed with IL-17 inhibitors. If a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs  administration of bimekizumab should be discontinued immediately and appropriate therapy initiated.Live vaccines should not be given in patients treated with bimekizumab.Please consult the summary of product characteristics in relation to other side effects  full safety and prescribing information.European SmPC date of revision: April 2024. https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/product-information/bimzelx-epar-product- information_en.pdf*EU/EEA means European Union/European Economic Area▼ This medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring.

By their nature  such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and assumptions which might cause the actual results  financial condition  performance or achievements of UCB  or industry results  to differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Important factors that could result in such differences include: changes in general economic  business and competitive conditions  the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing  costs associated with research and development  changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB  effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations  safety  quality  data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches  or disruptions of our information technology systems  product liability claims  challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates  competition from other products including biosimilars  changes in laws or regulations  exchange rate fluctuations  changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws  and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline  will progress to product approval or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far  the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models  cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products  which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to differences disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB's efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also  UCB or others could discover safety  side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB's products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover  sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment  including pricing pressure  political and public scrutiny  customer and prescriber patterns or practices  and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes. Finally  a breakdown  cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality  integrity and availability of UCB's data and systems.Given these uncertainties  you should not place undue reliance on any of such forward-looking statements.

This increase includes in particular: the impact of leasing activity and index-linked rent reviews for +€1.5m;index-linked rent reviews for +€1.5m; additional rental income from the completion in 2023 of Jump in the Portes de Paris business park  the B034 hotel in Pont de Flandre and M Factory in Marseille  and the acquisition of the Ponant B building in the 15 th district of Paris;district of Paris; the loss of rental income due to the sale in 2023 of the Eko Active building in Marseille and the residential portfolio in the Paris region. On a like-for-like basis  gross rental income from Property Investment rose by +1.7%  driven by index-linked rent reviews6 (+5.1%) and partly offset by the net impact of tenant arrivals and departures in 2023 (-4.3%).In the well-positioned office and light industrial segments  like-for-like growth in gross rental income was more marked  at +5.1% and +7.1% respectively. Operational indicators supported by well-positioned offices and light industrial properties In a rental market subdued since the beginning of the year  Icade has signed or renewed 23 leases covering around 14 000 sq.m  worth €3.8m in annualised headline rental income (94.3% of which in the well-positionedoffice and light industrial segments) and with a WAULT to break of 6.9 years. New leases signed represent more than 11 000 sq.m: In Nanterre  Schneider Electric signed an additional 3 700 sq.m in the Edenn building   currently being developed  for 9 years with no break option  bringing total pre-let space in the building to 71%. In Rungis  R&O Seafood Gastronomy signed a lease for 1 500 sq.m in the Séville Venise building for 9 years with no break option .Lease renewals of almost 3 000 sq.m relate mainly to the Rungis area  with the renewal and extension of the lease with Semeru for 2 015 sq.m in the Amsterdam building for 12 years   of which 9 with no break option. The financial occupancy rate stood at 87.8% as of March 31  2024  a slight decrease of 0.1 pps compared to December 31  2023 (87.9%). The breakdown of occupancy rates by asset class shows very different dynamics and situations  with occupancy rates above 91% in the well- positioned office and light industrial segments  whereas the financial occupancy rate for offices to be repositioned fell  as expected  to 70.4% (-1.0 pp). 6 100% of leases are index-linked: c. 80% to the ILAT index and c. 20% to the ICC or ILC indices 2Weighted average unexpired Financial occupancy rate* (in %) lease term to first break* (in years) Asset classes 03/31/2024 12/31/2023 Change 03/31/2024 12/31/2023 Offices - well-positioned 91.3% 91.0% +0.3 pps 3.8 3.9 Offices - to be repositioned 70.4% 71.4% (1.0) pps 1.8 1.9 SUBTOTAL OFFICES 87.2% 87.1% +0.1 pps 3.5 3.5 Light industrial 91.2% 92.1% (0.9) pps 3.0 3.1 Other 90.2% 90.5% (0.3) pps 5.3 5.4 TOTAL PROPERTY INVESTMENT 87.8% 87.9% (0.1) pps 3.5 3.6 (*) On a full consolidation basis  except for equity-accounted assets which are included on a proportionate consolidation basis. The WAULT to first break stood at 3.5 years  relatively stable compared to the end of 2023. The resilience of operational indicators for well-positioned offices illustrates Icade's confidence in the continued commercial use of these buildings over the long term as they meet customers' requirements in terms of their central location  environmental quality  amenities and flexibility. 1.2 PROPERTY DEVELOPMENT DIVISION Revenue bolstered in Q1 by the backlog built up in 2023 Economic revenue amounted to €259.3m as of March 31  2024  up +14.4% compared to March 31  2023. This increase was mainly due to the sale of residential units from the backlog built up in 2023 and to historically low revenue in Q1 20237. Revenue from the residential segment was up +15.1% to €189m (vs. €165m as of March 31  2023).Revenue from the commercial segment was stable at €60m  reflecting in particular the progress of works at the Envergure complex in Romainville and the Audessa project in Lyon.Revenue in the ""Other"" segment related to land sales and amounted to €9.5m (compared with €1.9m as of March 31  2023)  mainly from the sale of a plot in Bondy.

Bulk sales to institutional investors  such as intermediate housing providers  social landlords and operators of serviced residences  partly offset the fall in demand from individual buyers  who have been affected by the less favourable credit conditions9 and the phasing out of the Pinel tax incentive scheme. Q1 2023 revenue accounted for just 17.5% of the Property Development Division's total annual revenue  compared with 23.2% in 2022 and 21.0% in 2021.

HIGHLIGHTS 2.1 SOLID CSR RESULTS RECOGNISED AND APPROVED BY THE SHAREHOLDERS AT THE GENERAL MEETING Say on Climate and Say on Biodiversity: 2023 results approved by the 2024 General Meeting At the General Meeting held on April 19  2024  Icade was the first company in France to submit two separate resolutions on climate and biodiversity  both of which are key to the low-carbon  rewilded city of 2050. In this light  the General Meeting approved: by 99.30% the Say on Climate resolution on the Group's 2023 results in terms of reducing carbon intensity (-35% for Property Investment and -12% for Property Development over the 2019-2023 period) and reducing the Group's emissions (-21% in absolute terms over the 2019-2023 period)  in line with the 1.5°C pathway approved by the SBTi;the resolution on the Group's 2023 results in terms of reducing carbon intensity (-35% for Property Investment and -12% for Property Development over the 2019-2023 period) and reducing the Group's emissions (-21% in absolute terms over the 2019-2023 period)  in line with the 1.5°C pathway approved by the SBTi; by 98.65% the Say on Biodiversity resolution on the progress made in preserving biodiversity  including the measurement of the proportion of development projects with a positive impact on nature upon completion (52% of projects launched in 2023) and the measurement of biodiversity indicators for business parks (impact on soil  fauna  flora  water  etc.). A strong and recognised commitment to promoting energy efficiency in buildings In October 2023  Icade confirmed its commitment to its energy efficiency programme by signing Part 2 of the Charter of Commitment at the French Ministry of Energy Transition. Thanks to the active involvement of Icade's customers  the measures implemented made it possible to reduce the energy consumption of the Property Investment portfolio by a further -5%over the winter 2023-2024 following a -20% reduction in the previous winter. In addition  in Q1 2024  Icade was awarded a Cube d'Or for its Hyfive building in La Défense by the French institute for energy performance in buildings.
