MEPs call to seize Russia’s hundreds of billions in frozen assetsEuronews ^ | 23 April 2024 | Jack SchicklerPosted on by MeganC(European Union) Lawmakers want to see more support for Ukraine as US and UK counterparts advance.EU lawmakers have called for Russian state assets to be seized to support Ukraine  saying existing plans worth billions of euros don’t go far enough.EU countries are already discussing plans to deliver an aid package worth around €3bn a year to Ukraine by using the interest from capital held within the bloc by the Russian central bank.But EU lawmakers want to go further  as US counterparts finalise a €57 billion aid package for the war-torn country.“Europe needs to seize all of Russia's underlying assets and it needs to do so now ” Włodzimierz Cimoszewicz (Poland/Socialists and Democrats) said at the final European Parliament session ahead of June elections  warning that otherwise Ukraine “may run simply out of money”.He’s joined from across the political divide by lawmakers who think existing measures  proposed by the European Commission in March and currently being mulled by EU members  don’t go far enough.“Every day brings new damages to Ukraine ” said Andrius Kubilius (Lithuania/European People’s Party)  adding: “Russia needs to pay.”After significant political wrangling  the US House of Representatives on Saturday agreed a significant support package for Ukraine  winning plaudits from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.But the lion’s share of Russian extraterritorial assets  some €210bn  are held within the EU  chiefly at the Euroclear depositary in Belgium.EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell has argued the bloc should be able to profit from Russia’s holdings so Ukraine can defend itself  rather than using expropriated assets only to fund reconstruction.(Excerpt) Read more at euronews.com ...TOPICS:Foreign AffairsNews/Current EventsRussiaUkraineKEYWORDS:assetseupsychomaximusrussiaukraineHey!

Their oft-stated reason for this war in Ukraine is that they attacked Ukraine as an indirect way of attacking NATO. In December 2021 the Russians demanded that NATO eject the former Warsaw Pact members from NATO membership and to allow Russia to re-establish their control of Eastern Europe. Russia made themselves an enemy of NATO and of Europe. The measure by the EU to use Russian assets to fund the destruction of Russia is then called for because in truth it is a defensive measure against overt Russian imperialism. “But I suppose it’s totally worth it to stick it to the ruzzzians.” Yes  it is. It is totally worth it to stop Russia in Ukraine rather than wait for them to move on a NATO member.by 13 posted onby MeganC (""Russians are subhuman"" - posted by Kazan 8 March 2024)To: RightOnTheBorderHaving any sort of discussion with a zeeper is pointless.

That will necessitate a move away from the dollar as the international reserve currency  and a strengthening of BRICS+. When the USD is subject to thievery and inflation  it becomes undesirable as a reserve currency. Its reliability and stability will be subject to how the political winds blow. Inflating the dollar helps to finance wars and stuff by devaluing the petrodollars abroad — it devalues our international debt. It also devalues the dollar in the United States. When other nations move out of petrodollars  a greater share of the inflation damage will be borne in the United States.To: woodpusherRead the title and article.

The Nomination Committee may also appoint an external compensation consultant to provide advice and benchmarking. The Chair of the Board of Millicom does not participate in discussions or decision-making regarding Director remuneration.Remuneration to Directors comprises cash-based and share-based components  weighted toward shares to align with the compensation philosophy and guidelines of the Company set out in item 22. Directors appointed to Board Committees receive cash-based compensation for each appointment.Share-based compensation is in the form of fully paid-up shares of Millicom common stock. There are no retention  vesting or other holding conditions attached to the shares. Such shares are provided from the Company’s treasury shares or alternatively issued within Millicom’s authorized share capital exclusively in exchange for allocation from the premium reserve (i.e.  for nil consideration from the relevant Directors). Share-based compensation is calculated by dividing the approved remuneration by the average Millicom closing share price on the Nasdaq Stock Market in the US for the three-month period ending on April 30  2024  provided that shares shall not be issued below par value.Notwithstanding the above  for any period where a Director is also an employee of Millicom  no remuneration is paid to that Director beyond any compensation received as an employee of Millicom.Directors’ RemunerationThe Nomination Committee proposes the compensation for the period from the date of the AGM to the date of the 2025 AGM  as follows:Cash2024/2025(USD) Shares2024/2025(USD) Chair of the Board (1)* 105 000 210 000 Board members (8)* 55 000 105 000 Audit and Compliance Committee chair (1)* 45 000 - Audit and Compliance Committee members (3)* 22 500 - Compensation and Talent Committee chair (1)* 25 000 - Compensation and Talent Committee members (2)* 12 500 - Total 707 500 1 050 000* Not payable while the Chair or a Board member receives compensation as an employee of Millicom.

At least one member of the Nomination Committee must be independent of the Company’s largest shareholder in terms of votes or any group of shareholders who act in concert in governance of the Company. The Chair of the Board shall act as the Nomination Committee’s convener  and the members of the Nomination Committee will appoint the Nomination Committee’s chair at their first meeting  provided that the Chair of the Board may not serve as the chair of the Nomination Committee. Before the assignment is accepted  a proposed member of the Nomination Committee shall carefully consider any conflict of interest or other circumstances that makes membership of the Nomination Committee inappropriate. The Chief Executive Officer or other members of the executive management may be invited by the chair of the Nomination Committee to participate in meetings of the Nomination Committee as considered appropriate.The Nomination Committee is appointed for a term of office commencing at the time of its formation  which must be no later than six months before the annual general meeting and ending when a new Nomination Committee is formed.

If that shareholder declines to appoint a new member  the Nomination Committee may choose to ask the next largest qualified shareholder to appoint a Nomination Committee member and so on.In the event of changes to the ownership structure of the Company  whereby a shareholder that has appointed a member to the Nomination Committee significantly reduces its shareholding  such member shall immediately resign from the Nomination Committee  unless the other members unanimously decide that such person shall remain until the end of their term. In addition  the Nomination Committee may decide to change its composition and invite the new larger shareholder(s) to appoint a member of the Nomination Committee. In its decision  the Nomination Committee shall inter alia take into account the status of its work  the time remaining to the annual general meeting and the nature of the change in ownership. If more than three months remain until the annual general meeting  however  a shareholder that has become amongst the three largest shareholders shall always  at its request  have the right to appoint a member of the Nomination Committee.The Nomination Committee shall have the right to receive  upon request  personnel resources  such as secretarial services from Millicom  and to charge Millicom with costs for recruitment consultants and related travel if deemed strictly necessary to discharge its duties.AGM – item 20 (Rectified): SHARE REPURCHASE PLANThe Board proposes that the meeting resolves to approve a share repurchase plan on the following terms:To authorize the Board  at any time between May 23  2024 and the date of the 2025 annual general meeting of shareholders  to repurchase Millicom's common shares and Swedish Depository Receipts (SDRs)  hereafter individually and collectively referred to as the “Shares”  in accordance with applicable laws and regulations in force  and in particular the Luxembourg law of 10 August 1915 on commercial companies  as amended from time to time (the ""Luxembourg Commercial Companies Law"") (the "" Share Repurchase Plan"")  and subject to the following conditions: The transactions under the Share Repurchase Plan may be carried out by any permitted means  including but not limited to entering into market  off-market  over-the-counter and mutual agreement transactions  through payment in cash or in kind  using distributable profits  available reserves  new shares issue  derivative financial instruments or any other financing mechanism.

Long Term Incentives (“LTI”): to align senior management long-term incentives with the long-term interests of shareholders  encouraging long-term value creation  retention and management focus on long-term value and commitment to the Company. Based on these key principles  the LTI design for 2024 is a balance of share price appreciation  retention and ESG targets approved by the Compensation & Talent Committee and the Board.

DISH Network Corporation  American Tower Corporation  Altice USA  Inc.  Sirius XM Holdings Inc.  Global Payments Inc.  Liberty Latin America Ltd.  Frontier Communications Parent  Inc.  Telephone and Data Systems  Inc.  United States Cellular Corporation  AMC Networks Inc.  SBA Communications Corporation and Cable One  Inc.Senior Management Remuneration Policy(i) Base salary and benefitsBase annual salaries shall be competitive and based on individual responsibilities and performance. The base salary and other benefits of the CEO are proposed by the Compensation and Talent Committee and approved by the Board  and the base salary and benefits of the EVPs are proposed by the CEO and approved by the Compensation and Talent Committee.(ii) Variable remunerationSenior management may receive variable remuneration in addition to base salary.

For the 2025 DSP grant  Corporate Directors  General Managers and senior in-country leadership teams are eligible for a Deferred Cash Plan (the “DCP”) instead of the DSP.STI measures  and relative weightings (shown below) are designed to reflect Millicom’s strategic goals of encouraging profitable operations  efficient use of capital  overall growth and customer focus:Service Revenue (25%)  Earnings Before Interest  Tax  Depreciation and Amortization (“EBITDA”) (25%)  Equity Free Cash Flow (“EFCF”) (25%)  Personal Performance* (25%).* Personal Performance is assessed on achievement of personalized qualitative and quantitative goals aligned to the overall strategy and objectives of the Company.The DSP seeks to attract and retain management employees  by rewarding for past performance and incentivizing longer-term service. It is part of Millicom’s short-term incentive program and as such the Board deems that pro rata vesting (30%/30%/40%) over a three-year period is reasonable in order to achieve the objectives of Millicom’s overall compensation and reward strategy.Modifications compared to the 2023 STI-DSP(i) 2024 STI paid in 2025The Compensation and Talent Committee implemented a redistribution of weights for both the 2025 DSP and 2025 DCP  reducing the personal performance from 30% to 25% and assigning equal weights to the three financial metrics totaling 75%. Additionally  the Committee also introduced EFCF as a new metric  in replacement of OFCFaL and Relational Net Promoter Score  to align with the principal financial target disclosed by the Company.(ii) 2025 DSP (based on 2024 performance)Eligibility for participation in the DSP component is limited to Millicom’s CEO  EVPs and Corporate Vice Presidents (“VPs”). Currently  16 individuals are included in this group. The metrics are the same as the 2024 STI metrics.(iii) 2025 DCP (based on 2024 performance)Corporate Directors and senior in-country leadership (excluding General Managers) are eligible for a Deferred Cash Plan instead of the DSP  with the same targets as the DSP and 2024 STI metrics. Currently  111 individuals are included in this group.For the General Managers  the DSP is also replaced with a Deferred Cash Plan (DCP)  with individual country targets:Service Revenue (50%)  and EFCF (50%). Long-term Incentive Plan (“LTI”)The LTI is a share-based plan whereby the awards granted vest at the end of a three-year period  subject to achievement against performance measures and fulfillment of conditions. These measures  and their relative weightings  are shown below:Stock Appreciation Rights (SARs) (60%)  Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) (30%)  and Performance Shares with ESG target achievement (10%)Modifications compared to the 2023 LTIFor 2024  we have moved towards an incentive plan focused on shareholder value creation  long-term incentive and retention using three equity vehicles: Stock Appreciation Rights (SARs)  Restricted Stock Units (RSUs)  and Performance Shares based on achievement of ESG metrics. For the ESG metric  the Compensation and Talent Committee has proposed to reduce from 5 metrics to 1  focusing on carbon emissions.EligibilityEligibility for participation in the LTI is limited to Millicom’s CEO  EVPs and VPs. Currently  16 individuals are included in this group.For General Managers  the LTI is merged into the DCP plan described above  including the same metrics.2024 LTI (based on 2024-2026 performance)Information on the 2024 LTI  including performance measures and payout scales (based on performance from 2024 to 2026)  and the number of share awards to be granted  is included in agenda item 23 below.(iii) Other benefitsOther benefits can include  for example  car allowance  medical coverage and  in limited cases  while on an expat assignment  housing allowance  school fees  and home leave.(iv) PensionThe Global Senior Management Team  which is comprised of Millicom’s CEO  EVPs  VPs and General Managers are eligible to participate in a global retirement saving plan which also covers death and disability insurance.

Company contributions to the global defined contribution retirement saving plan range between 10% and 15% of the executive’s base pay.Notice of termination and severance payIf the employment of Millicom’s most senior management is terminated  a notice period of up to 12 months could potentially apply.Other Policies and PracticesThe Board regularly reviews best practices in executive compensation and governance and revises policies and practices when appropriate.Deviations from the policy and guidelinesIn special circumstances  the Board may deviate from the above policy and guidelines  including additional variable remuneration in the case of exceptional performance.Where such deviation relates to the CEO’s remuneration  the Board may temporarily deviate from the above policy and guidelines until the 2025 AGM to ensure the long-term interest and continuity of Millicom or guarantee its viability.Independent AdvisorThe Board has retained Mercer as its independent compensation consultant. Mercer provides advice  executive benchmarking data and best practices and makes suggestions based on its knowledge of the market.– item 23: SHARE-BASED INCENTIVE PLANSoutlined in the proposed guidelines and policy for senior management remuneration in agenda item 22 above (and the corresponding guidelines approved at the 2023 AGM)  variable compensation includes the following share-based incentive plans:a short-term Deferred Share Plan (DSP)  and a three-year Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTI).is no legal requirement for Millicom (as a Luxembourg company) to obtain shareholder approval of share-based incentive plans. Nonetheless  following past practice and in alignment with the expectations of Millicom’s shareholders  the Board proposes that the meeting resolves to approve the 2024 DSP  the 2024 LTI and the granting of share awards under both plans  as further described below.of the PlansCompensation and Talent Committee of the Board monitors and evaluates programs for variable remuneration (both ongoing programs and those that have ended during the year)  the manner in which the guidelines for remuneration to senior management adopted at the AGM have been applied  and the current remuneration structure and levels of remuneration in Millicom. The design of each share-based plan is reviewed each year to ensure that:The programs are well aligned with the interests of shareholders;The programs are designed to help attract  motivate and retain the competencies needed in Millicom’s senior management; andThe programs have a positive effect on Millicom’s development and thus are beneficial for both Millicom and its shareholders.Compensation and Talent Committee determines when an offer for the grant of share awards shall be made  the eligible employees to whom such offer shall be made and the terms governing the offer for the grant of share awards  in accordance with the principles adopted by the AGM. The Compensation and Talent Committee shall also have the right to resolve on more detailed terms and conditions in accordance with the Senior Management Remuneration Policy. Compensation and Talent Committee approves the detailed terms and conditions of the share-based compensation plans  in accordance with the terms and guidelines set out herein. In connection therewith  the Compensation and Talent Committee is entitled to make adjustments to meet foreign regulations or market conditions  and  in connection with delivery of shares to participants  offer share settlement in order to cover the participant’s tax costs upon vesting. Compensation and Talent Committee may make certain other adjustments  including deciding to reduce the delivery of shares for all participants  or for certain categories of participants covered by the 2024 LTI and 2024 DSP  if material changes occur within Millicom or in the market that  in the Board's assessment  mean that the terms and conditions for the allotment of shares under the plans no longer fulfil the main objectives of the plans.of the Proposal's Compensation and Talent Committee has prepared the 2024 DSP and the 2024 LTI in consultation with external advisors. The plans have been reviewed at meetings of the Compensation and Talent Committee in 2023 and in the first months of 2024.Proposed 2024 DSP (based on 2023 performance)The proposed 2024 DSP is based on a target percentage of the annual base salary of each participant and the performance related to the 2023 financial year. Each share unit granted carries a non-transferable right to receive one share in Millicom on the relevant vesting date. Eligibility for participation in the 2024 DSP is described in item 22.CalculationSTI compensation is calculated as Base Salary X a pre-determined % of base salary X plan performance.Performance measures (based on 2023 performance) and payout scalePerformance is measured on the extent to which performance targets (group  regional  or country level as applicable to each individual) are achieved  as follows:Performance measure % of the DSP Service revenue (SR) 20% EBITDA (earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortization) 20% OFCFaL (Operating Free Cash Flow after Leases) 20% rNPS (relational net promoter score) 10% Personal performance 30%Payout is based on a linear scale with minimum  target and maximum achievement of performance measures (except personal performance) as follows:Achievement Payout Achievement less than 95% of target 0% Achievement at 100% of target 100% Achievement at or above 104% (SR)  106% (EBITDA)  107% (OFCFaL) and/or 110% (tNPS) of target 200%Personal performance is based on the rating scale below  whereby employees rated “does not meet” do not receive any STI compensation  and employees rated ‘partially meets’ are not eligible to participate in the 2024 DSP.Performance rating Does not meet Partially meets Meets Exceeds Exceptionally Exceeds Payout 0% 15% on cash component.0% on share component. 30% 45% 60%Payment / vestingIf the AGM approves the 2024 DSP  and thereby the granting of share awards to the DSP Participants  the STI is paid in cash and in DSP shares: for senior leaders 30% / 70% at the top and 40% / 60% at the lower end. For employees not participating in the DSP  or to the extent that the DSP is not approved by the AGM  the STI (including the portion that would have been provided as shares) will be a cash bonus. The share awards will vest (generally subject to the participant still being employed by Millicom) 30% in Q1 2025  30% in Q1 2026 and 40% in Q1 2027.Grant of share awards1 141 873 share units were granted  conditional on AGM approval as per the above  under the DSP plan in Q1 2024  representing approximately 0.67% of the outstanding shares and outstanding votes.(ii) Proposed 2024 LTIThe proposed 2024 LTI award is divided in three equity vehicles: Stock Appreciation Rights (SARs)  Restricted Stock Units (RSUs)  and Performance Shares based on achievement of the ESG performance measure between 2024 and 2026. Eligibility for participation in the 2024 LTI is described in item 22.CalculationThe award value per participant is based on seniority and ranges from 35% to 315% at target (for the CEO) of base annual salary (as of January 1  2024) as follows:Seniority % of base annual salary (range) VPs 35%-70% CEO and EVPs 85%-315%This award will be divided into:1. Stock Appreciation Rights (SARs) - (60% of the award)  calculated based on Black-Scholes valuation of the stock price at fair market value of the grant.2. Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) – (30% of the award).3. Performance Shares with ESG metric – (10% of the award).Stock Appreciation Rights will vest in number of units as defined by the Black-Scholes valuation. The participant will have the eligibility to exercise these units during the seven-year period following the vesting date. Upon exercising these units  the appreciation will be paid in Millicom stock.Each Restricted Stock Unit and Performance Share unit will vest as one Millicom share  subject to the achievement of the following performance measures for the performance shares:Performance measure % of the LTI ESG metric – 2024-2026 measurement based on Carbon Emissions reduction target. 10%Payout for the Performance conditions for ESG target:In the event the Company achieves less than 80% of the target  the corresponding portion of the grant will be reduced to zero.In the event the Company achieves between 80% and 100% of the target  the corresponding portion of the grant will be adjusted in linear pro rata of the achievement starting at a payout of 0% to 100%.Payout is capped at 100% achievement.In addition  participants who receive a ‘does not meet’ performance rating are not eligible to participate in the LTI in the following year.Payment / vestingThe equity awards vest after a three-year vesting period  in Q1 2027  subject to achievement of performance measures and the participant being employed by Millicom at the time of vesting.Grant of share awardsAt target 193 537 share units are granted under the 2024 LTI plan corresponding to RSUs and Performance Shares  representing approximately 0.11% of the outstanding shares and votes. The amount of SARs to be granted are subject to the share price valuation following approval of the LTI by the Compensation and Talent Committee  i.e.  April 4  2024.Share ownership requirementsParticipants in the LTI are subject to Millicom’s Share Ownership Policy  which requires them to maintain the minimum levels of share ownership based on the size of their annual share grants  or hold all shares vested (post tax) under either the LTI or the DSP until reaching those minimum levels. These levels currently range from 400% of base salary to 50% of base salary.Accounting  cost and maximum number of sharesBoth the DSP and LTI are accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2  which requires the cost of share awards to be recorded as employee costs in the income statement over the vesting period  based on the number of shares expected to vest and the fair value of those shares. Elements specific to each plan are as follows:(i) 2024 DSPNo expense is recognized for DSP share awards that do not ultimately vest. Vesting of the shares is not dependent on market conditions. The number of shares that may vest  approximate cost and percentage of outstanding shares (based on grant share price of USD 16.33) are as follows:Shares that may vest Approximate cumulative three-year cost (USD) % of outstanding shares At Maximum 1 141 873 18.65 million 0.67%The costs and dilution are expected to have only a marginal effect on key ratios of Millicom.Information on performance of the 2023 STI and on the 2024 DSP grant will be presented in Millicom’s 2024 Annual Report.(ii) 2024 LTINo expense is recognized for share awards that do not ultimately vest  except for the Stock Appreciation Rights (SARs) portion of the LTI where vesting is conditional upon a market condition  which are treated as vested regardless of whether or not the market conditions are satisfied  provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.

The formal Notice of AGM is set out on pages 5 and 6 of this document  detailing the Resolutions that the shareholders are being asked to vote on  with explanatory notes of the business to be conducted at the AGM on pages 9 to 11. Details of the arrangements for the AGM are set out on page 17. The AGM provides shareholders with an opportunity to communicate with the Directors and we welcome your participation. If the chair of the AGM is appointed as proxy he or she will  of course  vote in accordance with any instructions given. If he or she is given discretion as to how to vote  he or she will vote in favour of each of the Resolutions. At the conclusion of the AGM  it is proposed that a number of Board and Committee changes will take effect. As advised at the last AGM due to her length of service  Ms Bárbara Garza Lagüera will no longer be considered as an independent director under the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code  and therefore will be retiring from the Board. Mr Juan Bordes  who has also been a member of the Board as a Non-executive Director for more than 16 years will also be retiring. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Bárbara and Juan for their outstanding contribution to the Board over the past years. I am pleased to report that Mr Charlie Jacobs  who has also been a member of the Board for more than nine years  has agreed to remain on the Board  having stepped down as the Company's Senior Independent Director  and will be proposed for re-election as a Non-independentNon-executive Director  even though the Board continues to consider him to be independent in character and judgement. I am also pleased to note that the Board  on advice from the Nominations Committee  has recommended that Ms Luz Adriana Ramírez and Ms Rosa Vázquez be proposed for election as Independent Non-executive Directors of the Company at the AGM. Full biographical details of these two strong nominees are shown on page 16. I look forward  subject to shareholder approval  to welcoming these two new directors to the Board and I am pleased that the Company will still be able to benefit from Mr Jacobs' knowledge and expertise. The purpose of the Annual General Meeting is to seek shareholders' approval for the Resolutions. The following is a brief summary of the business of the 2024 AGM: Resolution 1 relates to the receiving of the report and accounts for the year ended 31 December 2023 (the '2023 Annual Report'). Resolution 2 relates to the approval of a final dividend. As set out in the Company's preliminary results announcement on 5 March 2024  the Directors recommend a final dividend of 4.20 US cents per Ordinary Share. If the recommended final dividend is approved  this will be paid on 29 May 2024 to all ordinary shareholders who are on the register of members at close of business on 19 April 2024. Resolution 3 is to approve the Annual Report on Remuneration (excluding the part containing the Directors' Remuneration Policy)  as set out on pages 226 to 237 of the 2023 Annual Report. Resolutions 4 to 15 relate to the election of two new independent Non-executive Directors in accordance with the Companies Act and the re-election of all of the continuing Directors  who are not retiring  in accordance with Provision 18 of the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code. Resolutions 9 to 15 relate to the election or re-election of the independent Directors  in accordance with the UK Listing Rules which are applicable to companies with a controlling shareholder. Resolutions 9 to 15 require approval by a majority of votes cast by independent shareholders as well as all shareholders of the Company. Biographies for all of the Directors can be found on pages 12 to 16 of this document  together with reasons why their contribution continues to be important to the Company's long-term sustainable success. The Board's annual board performance evaluation (as further detailed on pages 206 to 208 of the 2023 Annual Report) confirmed that each Director proposed for re-election continues to perform effectively and demonstrates commitment to their role. On the recommendation of the Nominations Committee  the Board believes that the considerable and wide-ranging experience of all the continuing Directors will continue to be invaluable to the Company and therefore recommends their re-election. At present  over 50% of the Board members are independent Non-executive Directors. Resolutions 16 and 17 relate to the re-appointment of auditors and the authorisation of the Audit Committee to set their fees. Resolutions 18 to 21 relate to the share capital of the Company: Resolution 18 seeks shareholder approval in order to authorise the Directors  for the purposes of Section 551 of Act  to allot shares or grant rights to subscribe for or convert any security into shares up to an aggregate nominal amount of US$122 815 598. This represents one third of the total issued Ordinary Share capital of the Company as at 11 April 2024  being the last practicable date before publication of this Notice. 3 - FRESNILLO PLC NOTICE OF ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING 2024Resolution 19 seeks shareholder approval that if Resolution 18 is passed  the Directors be authorised to allot equity securities for cash as if Section 561(1) and sub-sections (1) to (6) of Section 562 of the Act did not apply. Such authority is limited to (i) allotments for rights issues and other pre-emptive issues and (ii) the allotment of equity securities on a non pre-emptive basis up to an aggregate nominal amount of US$18 422 339  representing no more than 5% of the total issued Ordinary Share capital of the Company as at 11 April 2024  being the last practicable date before publication of this Notice. Resolution 20 seeks shareholder approval for the Directors to be authorised  in addition to any authority granted under Resolution 19  to allot equity securities for cash under the authority given by Resolution 18  as if Section 561(1) and sub-sections (1) to (6) of Section 562 of the Act did not apply. Such authority is limited to allotments for the purposes of financing a transaction which the Board determines to be an acquisition or specified capital investment of the kind contemplated by the Statement of Principles on Disapplying Pre-Emption Rights published by the Pre-Emption Group in November 2022  and the allotment of equity securities is limited to the nominal amount of US$18 422 339. This represents no more than 5% of the total issued Ordinary Share capital of the Company as at 11 April 2024  being the last practicable date before publication of this Notice. Resolution 21 seeks shareholder approval in order to authorise the Directors  for the purposes of Section 701 of the Act  to make market purchases of Ordinary Shares  up to a maximum number of 73 689 358 Ordinary Shares. This represents 10% of the total issued Ordinary Share capital of the Company as at 11 April 2024  being the last practicable date before publication of this Notice. Resolution 22 seeks shareholder approval to renew the authority passed at the AGM on 23 May 2023 for the purposes of the Companies (Shareholders' Rights) Regulations 2009 to call general meetings (other than an annual general meeting) on 14 clear days' notice  provided that facilities are available to shareholders to vote by electronic means for meetings called on such notice. The Company will not use such authority as a matter of routine  and only in circumstances where the flexibility is merited by the business of the meeting  the proposals are time- sensitive or where it would be to the advantage of the members as a whole and moreover where the proposals are not of a complexity that might require more time for consideration by members. The Board is always interested in the views of shareholders on the Company's activities and shareholders will be able to ask questions of the Board at the AGM. In line with best corporate governance  voting on the business of the meeting will be conducted on a poll. I would strongly encourage shareholders to exercise their right to vote in the following ways: You can cast your votes by proxy by completing the enclosed Form of Proxy and returning it to Equiniti Limited  FREEPOST RTHJ-CLLL-KBKU  Aspect House  Spencer Road  Lancing  West Sussex BN99 8LU  UK.

CREST Personal Members or other CREST sponsored members (and those CREST members who have appointed a voting service provider) should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider  who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf. In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made by means of CREST to be valid  the appropriate CREST message (a 'CREST Proxy Instruction') must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear's specifications and must contain the information required for such instructions  as described in the CREST Manual. The message (regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or an amendment to the instruction given to a previously appointed proxy) must  in order to be valid  be transmitted so as to be received by the issuer's agent (ID RA19) by the latest time(s) for receipt of proxy appointments specified in Note 3 above. For this purpose  the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST Applications Host) from which the issuer's agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. After this time any change of instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should be communicated to the appointee through other means. CREST members (and  where applicable  their CREST sponsors or voting service providers) should note that Euroclear does not make available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings and limitations will therefore apply in relation to the inputof CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or  if the CREST member is a CREST personal member or sponsored member or has appointed a voting service provider  to procure that their CREST sponsor or voting service provider takes) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection  CREST members (and  where applicable  their CREST sponsors or voting service providers) are referred  in particular  to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings. The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001 (as amended). Proxymity instructions 14. If you are an institutional investor  you may be able to appoint a proxy electronically via the Proxymity platform  a process which has been agreed by the Company and approved by the Registrar. For further information regarding Proxymity  please go to www.proxymity.io. Your proxy must be lodged by 12.00 noon (UK time) on Friday 17 May 2024. In order to be considered valid. Before you can appoint a proxy via this process you will need to have agreed to Proxymity's associated terms and conditions. It is important that you read these carefully as you will be bound by them  and they will govern the electronic appointment of your proxy. Automatic poll voting 15. Each of the resolutions to be put to the meeting will be voted on by poll and not by show of hands. A poll reflects the number of voting rights exercisable by each member and so the Board considers it a more democratic method of voting  which is also in line with best corporate governance practice. Proxies (and members  if permitted to attend) will be asked to complete a poll card to indicate how they wish to cast their votes. These cards will be collected at the end of the meeting. The results of the poll will be published on the Company's website and notified to the market once the votes have been counted and verified. Publication of audit concerns 16. Under Section 527 of the Act members meeting the threshold requirements set out in that section have the right to require the Company to publish on a website a statement setting out any matter relating to: (a) the audit of the Company's accounts (including the Auditors' Report and the conduct of the audit) that are to be laid before the Annual General Meeting; or (b) any circumstance connected with an auditor of the Company ceasing to hold office since the previous meeting at which annual accounts and reports were laid in accordance with Section 437 of the Act. The Company may not require the shareholders requesting any such website publication to pay its expenses in complying with Sections 527 or 528 of the Act. Where the Company is required to place a statement on a website under Section 527 of the Act  it must forward the statement to the Company's auditor not later than the time when it makes the statement available on the website. The business which may be dealt with at the Annual General Meeting includes any statement that the Company has been required under Section 527 of the Act to publish on a website. Questions 17. The Board is always interested in the views of shareholders on the Company's activities  and we remain as committed as always to engagement with our shareholders. Any shareholder attending the meeting has the right to ask questions. The Company must cause to be answered any such question relating to the business being dealt with at the meeting but no such answer need be given if (a) to do so would interfere unduly with the preparation for the meeting or involve the disclosure of confidential information  or (b) the answer has already been given on a website in the form of an answer to a question  or (c) it is undesirable in the interests of the Company or the good order of the meeting that the question be answered. Documents on display 18. Copies of the Letters of Appointment between the Company and its Non-executive Directors  will be available for inspection at the registered office of the Company during usual business hours on any weekday (Saturdays  Sundays and public holidays in England and Wales excluded) until the date of the AGM and also at the place of the AGM from 15 minutes prior to the commencement of the meeting until the conclusion thereof. Information available on the website 19. A copy of this Notice and other information required by Section 311A of the Act can be found at www.fresnilloplc.com. Electronic Addresses 20.

The formal Notice of AGM is set out on pages 5 and 6 of this document  detailing the Resolutions that the shareholders are being asked to vote on  with explanatory notes of the business to be conducted at the AGM on pages 9 to 11. Details of the arrangements for the AGM are set out on page 17. The AGM provides shareholders with an opportunity to communicate with the Directors and we welcome your participation. If the chair of the AGM is appointed as proxy he or she will  of course  vote in accordance with any instructions given. If he or she is given discretion as to how to vote  he or she will vote in favour of each of the Resolutions. At the conclusion of the AGM  it is proposed that a number of Board and Committee changes will take effect. As advised at the last AGM due to her length of service  Ms Bárbara Garza Lagüera will no longer be considered as an independent director under the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code  and therefore will be retiring from the Board. Mr Juan Bordes  who has also been a member of the Board as a Non-executive Director for more than 16 years will also be retiring. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Bárbara and Juan for their outstanding contribution to the Board over the past years. I am pleased to report that Mr Charlie Jacobs  who has also been a member of the Board for more than nine years  has agreed to remain on the Board  having stepped down as the Company's Senior Independent Director  and will be proposed for re-election as a Non-independentNon-executive Director  even though the Board continues to consider him to be independent in character and judgement. I am also pleased to note that the Board  on advice from the Nominations Committee  has recommended that Ms Luz Adriana Ramírez and Ms Rosa Vázquez be proposed for election as Independent Non-executive Directors of the Company at the AGM. Full biographical details of these two strong nominees are shown on page 16. I look forward  subject to shareholder approval  to welcoming these two new directors to the Board and I am pleased that the Company will still be able to benefit from Mr Jacobs' knowledge and expertise. The purpose of the Annual General Meeting is to seek shareholders' approval for the Resolutions. The following is a brief summary of the business of the 2024 AGM: Resolution 1 relates to the receiving of the report and accounts for the year ended 31 December 2023 (the '2023 Annual Report'). Resolution 2 relates to the approval of a final dividend. As set out in the Company's preliminary results announcement on 5 March 2024  the Directors recommend a final dividend of 4.20 US cents per Ordinary Share. If the recommended final dividend is approved  this will be paid on 29 May 2024 to all ordinary shareholders who are on the register of members at close of business on 19 April 2024. Resolution 3 is to approve the Annual Report on Remuneration (excluding the part containing the Directors' Remuneration Policy)  as set out on pages 226 to 237 of the 2023 Annual Report. Resolutions 4 to 15 relate to the election of two new independent Non-executive Directors in accordance with the Companies Act and the re-election of all of the continuing Directors  who are not retiring  in accordance with Provision 18 of the 2018 UK Corporate Governance Code. Resolutions 9 to 15 relate to the election or re-election of the independent Directors  in accordance with the UK Listing Rules which are applicable to companies with a controlling shareholder. Resolutions 9 to 15 require approval by a majority of votes cast by independent shareholders as well as all shareholders of the Company. Biographies for all of the Directors can be found on pages 12 to 16 of this document  together with reasons why their contribution continues to be important to the Company's long-term sustainable success. The Board's annual board performance evaluation (as further detailed on pages 206 to 208 of the 2023 Annual Report) confirmed that each Director proposed for re-election continues to perform effectively and demonstrates commitment to their role. On the recommendation of the Nominations Committee  the Board believes that the considerable and wide-ranging experience of all the continuing Directors will continue to be invaluable to the Company and therefore recommends their re-election. At present  over 50% of the Board members are independent Non-executive Directors. Resolutions 16 and 17 relate to the re-appointment of auditors and the authorisation of the Audit Committee to set their fees. Resolutions 18 to 21 relate to the share capital of the Company: Resolution 18 seeks shareholder approval in order to authorise the Directors  for the purposes of Section 551 of Act  to allot shares or grant rights to subscribe for or convert any security into shares up to an aggregate nominal amount of US$122 815 598. This represents one third of the total issued Ordinary Share capital of the Company as at 11 April 2024  being the last practicable date before publication of this Notice. 3 - FRESNILLO PLC NOTICE OF ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING 2024Resolution 19 seeks shareholder approval that if Resolution 18 is passed  the Directors be authorised to allot equity securities for cash as if Section 561(1) and sub-sections (1) to (6) of Section 562 of the Act did not apply. Such authority is limited to (i) allotments for rights issues and other pre-emptive issues and (ii) the allotment of equity securities on a non pre-emptive basis up to an aggregate nominal amount of US$18 422 339  representing no more than 5% of the total issued Ordinary Share capital of the Company as at 11 April 2024  being the last practicable date before publication of this Notice. Resolution 20 seeks shareholder approval for the Directors to be authorised  in addition to any authority granted under Resolution 19  to allot equity securities for cash under the authority given by Resolution 18  as if Section 561(1) and sub-sections (1) to (6) of Section 562 of the Act did not apply. Such authority is limited to allotments for the purposes of financing a transaction which the Board determines to be an acquisition or specified capital investment of the kind contemplated by the Statement of Principles on Disapplying Pre-Emption Rights published by the Pre-Emption Group in November 2022  and the allotment of equity securities is limited to the nominal amount of US$18 422 339. This represents no more than 5% of the total issued Ordinary Share capital of the Company as at 11 April 2024  being the last practicable date before publication of this Notice. Resolution 21 seeks shareholder approval in order to authorise the Directors  for the purposes of Section 701 of the Act  to make market purchases of Ordinary Shares  up to a maximum number of 73 689 358 Ordinary Shares. This represents 10% of the total issued Ordinary Share capital of the Company as at 11 April 2024  being the last practicable date before publication of this Notice. Resolution 22 seeks shareholder approval to renew the authority passed at the AGM on 23 May 2023 for the purposes of the Companies (Shareholders' Rights) Regulations 2009 to call general meetings (other than an annual general meeting) on 14 clear days' notice  provided that facilities are available to shareholders to vote by electronic means for meetings called on such notice. The Company will not use such authority as a matter of routine  and only in circumstances where the flexibility is merited by the business of the meeting  the proposals are time- sensitive or where it would be to the advantage of the members as a whole and moreover where the proposals are not of a complexity that might require more time for consideration by members. The Board is always interested in the views of shareholders on the Company's activities and shareholders will be able to ask questions of the Board at the AGM. In line with best corporate governance  voting on the business of the meeting will be conducted on a poll.

For security reasons  all hand luggage may be subject to examination prior to entry to the AGM. Photography and filming will not be permitted in the AGM meeting room  and we would be grateful if you would ensure you switch off any mobile devices before the start of the meeting. We ask all those present at the AGM to facilitate the orderly conduct of the meeting and the safety of those attending and reserve the right  if orderly conduct or the safety of attendees is threatened by a person's behaviour  to require that person to leave. 7 - FRESNILLO PLC NOTICE OF ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING 2024CREST proxy instructions CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so for themeeting (and any adjournment of the meeting) by following the procedures described in the CREST Manual (available via www.euroclear.com). CREST Personal Members or other CREST sponsored members (and those CREST members who have appointed a voting service provider) should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider  who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf. In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made by means of CREST to be valid  the appropriate CREST message (a 'CREST Proxy Instruction') must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear's specifications and must contain the information required for such instructions  as described in the CREST Manual. The message (regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or an amendment to the instruction given to a previously appointed proxy) must  in order to be valid  be transmitted so as to be received by the issuer's agent (ID RA19) by the latest time(s) for receipt of proxy appointments specified in Note 3 above. For this purpose  the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST Applications Host) from which the issuer's agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. After this time any change of instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should be communicated to the appointee through other means. CREST members (and  where applicable  their CREST sponsors or voting service providers) should note that Euroclear does not make available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings and limitations will therefore apply in relation to the inputof CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or  if the CREST member is a CREST personal member or sponsored member or has appointed a voting service provider  to procure that their CREST sponsor or voting service provider takes) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection  CREST members (and  where applicable  their CREST sponsors or voting service providers) are referred  in particular  to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings. The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001 (as amended). Proxymity instructions 14. If you are an institutional investor  you may be able to appoint a proxy electronically via the Proxymity platform  a process which has been agreed by the Company and approved by the Registrar. For further information regarding Proxymity  please go to www.proxymity.io. Your proxy must be lodged by 12.00 noon (UK time) on Friday 17 May 2024. In order to be considered valid. Before you can appoint a proxy via this process you will need to have agreed to Proxymity's associated terms and conditions. It is important that you read these carefully as you will be bound by them  and they will govern the electronic appointment of your proxy. Automatic poll voting 15. Each of the resolutions to be put to the meeting will be voted on by poll and not by show of hands. A poll reflects the number of voting rights exercisable by each member and so the Board considers it a more democratic method of voting  which is also in line with best corporate governance practice. Proxies (and members  if permitted to attend) will be asked to complete a poll card to indicate how they wish to cast their votes. These cards will be collected at the end of the meeting. The results of the poll will be published on the Company's website and notified to the market once the votes have been counted and verified. Publication of audit concerns 16. Under Section 527 of the Act members meeting the threshold requirements set out in that section have the right to require the Company to publish on a website a statement setting out any matter relating to: (a) the audit of the Company's accounts (including the Auditors' Report and the conduct of the audit) that are to be laid before the Annual General Meeting; or (b) any circumstance connected with an auditor of the Company ceasing to hold office since the previous meeting at which annual accounts and reports were laid in accordance with Section 437 of the Act. The Company may not require the shareholders requesting any such website publication to pay its expenses in complying with Sections 527 or 528 of the Act. Where the Company is required to place a statement on a website under Section 527 of the Act  it must forward the statement to the Company's auditor not later than the time when it makes the statement available on the website. The business which may be dealt with at the Annual General Meeting includes any statement that the Company has been required under Section 527 of the Act to publish on a website. Questions 17. The Board is always interested in the views of shareholders on the Company's activities  and we remain as committed as always to engagement with our shareholders. Any shareholder attending the meeting has the right to ask questions. The Company must cause to be answered any such question relating to the business being dealt with at the meeting but no such answer need be given if (a) to do so would interfere unduly with the preparation for the meeting or involve the disclosure of confidential information  or (b) the answer has already been given on a website in the form of an answer to a question  or (c) it is undesirable in the interests of the Company or the good order of the meeting that the question be answered. Documents on display 18. Copies of the Letters of Appointment between the Company and its Non-executive Directors  will be available for inspection at the registered office of the Company during usual business hours on any weekday (Saturdays  Sundays and public holidays in England and Wales excluded) until the date of the AGM and also at the place of the AGM from 15 minutes prior to the commencement of the meeting until the conclusion thereof.

It would also need to be addressed as Korean bonds move to the Euroclear settlement platform from July this year.No decisions have yet been made on the specific changes to the rules but could include reducing reporting requirements to once or twice a day  said the sources  which included a finance ministry official who declined to be named. A current 7pm local deadline for reporting would also need to be addressed.""Many foreign institutions have pointed out that the requirement to report transactions manually every 15 minutes is a restriction in carrying out transactions efficiently  and we're working to improve that "" a source directly involved in the government discussion said  who declined to be named due to sensitivity of the issue.""We're communicating with relevant authorities to ease them "" he said.The FSS  South Korea's market regulator  declined to comment.The changes would follow recent reforms Asia's fourth-largest economy has introduced as it looks to shake off its classification as an emerging market and gain acceptance to major global market benchmarks.here or remove ads . 3rd party Ad.

39703,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.investorsobserver.com/news/qm-pr/5389938466254973,BenevolentAI Provides an Update on Its Business Priorities,Regulatory News:     BenevolentAI (&#x201C;BenevolentAI&#x201D; or the &#x201C;Company&#x201D;) (Euronext Amsterdam: BAI)  a leader in applying advanced AI to accelerate biopharma drug discovery  today announces an update on its business priorities.   ...,"BenevolentAI Provides an Update on Its Business PrioritiesRegulatory News:BenevolentAI (“BenevolentAI” or the “Company”) (Euronext Amsterdam: BAI)  a leader in applying advanced AI to accelerate biopharma drug discovery  today announces an update on its business priorities.Going forward the Company will focus on its AI-driven drug discovery collaboration and proprietary pipeline revenue generating pillars  following recent successes in these areas. The Board believes this focus will likely bring the greatest potential return for shareholders.Following completion of the market assessment of its Knowledge Exploration Tools  as noted at the time of the Company’s full year results on 14 March 2024  work on the Knowledge Exploration Tools will cease  given the investment needed to fully commercialise this SaaS product and the estimated timeframe to see a potential meaningful financial return.The impact of these changes will be a reduction in headcount by c.30%  with cash burn reduced by c.20%  extending the Company’s cash runway to late Q3 25  even after partial reinvestment of the savings into Phase Ib/IIa enabling studies for lead asset BEN-8744  following positive results from the Phase Ia trial.Since September 2023  the Company has made significant operational progress on multiple fronts  including signing the collaboration with Merck KGaA with a potential $594m in revenue generation  and announcing positive top line Phase Ia data on its lead asset BEN-8744 for the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC)  as well as making significant changes to strengthen its Executive Leadership Team.The Company had communicated in March 2024 that a current market assessment was underway of its Knowledge Exploration Tools that would determine if  or how  this opportunity complemented its wider commercial strategy. Following completion of this assessment  which took into account the level of further investment needed to successfully commercialise these tools as well as the timeframe within which a meaningful financial return could be expected  the Company has concluded that resources allocated to the development of these tools would be better utilised focusing on the Company’s two other revenue pillars  following on from recent successes in its AI driven drug discovery collaboration and proprietary pipeline pillars.As part of this evaluation of business priorities the overall headcount of the Company has been reviewed and following the decisions announced today  it is proposed that headcount will be reduced by around 30% and headcount is expected to end the year at c.180. Importantly  key skills  experience and capabilities have been retained and these reductions maintain the Company’s ability to execute on existing  or sign new  collaborations and continue to develop its core pipeline programmes. Additionally  the Company will close its US office. It is imperative for the operational effectiveness of the Company to have strong integration between its technology and scientific teams  and management believes this can be best achieved over its two largest sites in London and Cambridge  UK.While investment will continue to be made into the Company’s pipeline programmes and development of the BenevolentAI Platform™  the amended business priorities outlined above will result in a reduced cash burn of c.20% which will extend the Company’s cash runway to late Q3 2025. The Company will continue to explore all opportunities to fund the cash runway gap to year end 2025  at which time further larger milestones are expected to be received from existing partner programmes. These opportunities include potentially signing new drug discovery collaborations and out-licensing of the Company’s proprietary pipeline assets  where ongoing discussions with third parties are making good progress. The Company remains committed to its previous guidance of signing at least one new collaboration and out-licensing at least one of its pipeline assets during 2024. The Company will also continue to investigate a broad range of options to expand its shareholder base and also improve liquidity in its shares.Dr. Joerg Moeller  Chief Executive Officer of BenevolentAI  said: “While these situations are always difficult  as a company we have a duty to our shareholders to optimise capital allocation in the areas where we believe the potential return is the greatest. BenevolentAI is an AI augmented drug discovery company uniting science and technology with the aim to develop life-changing medicines for patients. Therefore  I believe that focusing our organisation on furthering our drug discovery collaborations and progressing our proprietary pipeline is the best way to achieve both the goal  of delivering value creation for our shareholders and delivering innovative medicines to patients suffering from very serious medical conditions.”Public disclosure of inside information in accordance with article 17(1) of the Regulation (EU) No 596/2014 on market abuse (Market Abuse Regulation)About BenevolentAIAt BenevolentAI (AMS: BAI)  we serve patients by leveraging our proprietary and validated Benevolent Platform™ that integrates AI and science to uncover new biology  predict novel targets and develop first-in-class or best-in-class drugs for complex diseases.

Order collection in the quarter shows a significant high-single-digit growth  too.Compared to the previous fiscal year  the Group's sales mix in the first quarter of 2024 has been characterized by a different composition in terms of product categories. In detail  sales of Driver's Equipment registered an increase of €0.4 million (+2.6%) compared to 2023 first quarter  driven by the growth of racing suits under the OMP brand; turnover of Car Parts increased by €0.3 million (+6.9%)  primarily due to supplies linked to the production programs of some main car manufacturers in Europe; the Other segment recorded a decrease of €0.7 million (-33.1%) due to non technical Racing Spirit branded apparel sales made at the beginning of the previous fiscal year to two major clients for the entire season  which had a combined impact of over €1 million in Q1 2023.In terms of geographical areas  all the major countries in the APAC region (Australia  China  and Japan) have recorded significant double-digit growth compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year  totaling an overall increase of +28.1%; sales in the EMEA region are substantially aligned with Q1 2023 (+0.3%)  while there was a contraction in the Americas (-10.5%). The variations in EMEA and the Americas were influenced by the aforementioned orders related to non-technical Racing Spirit branded apparel. Excluding these impacts  growth stands at +2.9% in EMEA and +2.5% in the Americas (+3.7% at constant FX rates).Dealers continue to represent the primary sales channel for the Group  accounting for 63% of total revenue in the first quarter of the year  slightly down from Q1 2023 (-1.7%)  mainly due to the activation of a new distributor in the UK at the beginning of 2023  which generated non-recurring sales volumes related to the initial stock order. In the first three months of 2024  there was a significant increase in revenue towards Team & Car Manufacturers (+6.9% overall  +36.9% excluding the two Racing Spirit orders in Q1 2023)  following important technical partnership agreements signed by the Group in the major world championships and national competitions (including Nascar  in the United States)  while sales to customers classified as Other decreased by €0.1 million (5.3%).Roberto Ferroggiaro  Chief Financial Officer of Racing Force Group  commented: ""In the first quarter of 2024  Group's sales have increased compared to the previous year  except for non-technical Racing Spirit branded apparel  as in Q1 2023 they included supplies for two major clients to cover the entire season. Excluding this effect  sales have increased by 5% overall compared to the previous year. Racewear  particularly OMP-branded fire-resistant suits  has been the main driver of the growth worldwide. Despite a particularly strong first quarter in 2023  the high-single-digit growth in order collection at the start of 2024 inspires great confidence for the rest of the season  awaiting the completion of investments aimed at increasing production and logistics capacity  to support both the growth in motorsports and the diversification projects in the defense helmets sector”.This publication embed ""🔒 Actusnews SECURITY MASTER "".- SECURITY MASTER Key: lG9sk8qblGuYm2qcYshonJdnmG9nxWXFapeWlGKdap+Ym3GSyZxibMmXZnFml2dq- Check this key: https://www.security-master-key.com .Regulated information:Inside Information:- News release on accounts  results Full and original press release in PDF: https://www.actusnews.com/news/85224-rfg-sales-q1-24.pdfReceive by email the next press releases of the company by registering on www.actusnews.com   it's free© 2024 ActusNews",positive,0.97,0.03,0.0,negative,0.02,0.44,0.55,True,English,"['Racing Force S.', 'Racing Force Group', 'positive order collection', 'core business', 'global scale', 'revenue', 'Q1', 'quarter', 'Racing Force S.p.A.', 'important technical partnership agreements', 'technical Racing Spirit branded', 'two Racing Spirit orders', 'current FX rates', 'constant FX rates', 'two major clients', 'Chief Financial Officer', 'defense helmets sector', 'next press releases', 'two seasonal orders', 'major world championships', 'Racing Force Group', 'OMP-branded fire-resistant suits', 'original press release', 'initial stock order', 'first three months', 'previous fiscal year', 'consolidated sales figures', 'primary sales channel', 'recurring sales volumes', 'significant double-digit growth', 'Euronext Growth segment', 'main car manufacturers', 'strong first quarter', 'significant high-single-digit growth', 'SECURITY MASTER Key', 'Actusnews SECURITY MASTER', 'racing suits', 'previous year', 'major countries', 'Other segment', 'Order collection', 'Car Parts', 'significant increase', '2024 first quarter', '2023 first quarter', 'safety components', 'same period', 'different composition', 'product categories', 'OMP brand', 'combined impact', 'geographical areas', 'APAC region', 'new distributor', 'national competitions', 'United States', 'Roberto Ferroggiaro', 'main driver', 'great confidence', 'logistics capacity', 'diversification projects', 'Regulated information', 'Inside Information', 'News release', 'sales mix', 'entire season', 'overall increase', 'parent company', 'total revenue', 'production programs', 'EMEA region', 'apparel sales', 'Q1 2024 sales', 'development', 'marketing', 'motorsports', 'Milan', 'RFG', 'Paris', 'line', 'terms', 'detail', 'Equipment', 'turnover', 'supplies', 'Europe', 'decrease', 'beginning', 'Australia', 'China', 'Japan', 'contraction', 'Americas', 'variations', 'impacts', 'Dealers', 'activation', 'UK', 'Team', 'Nascar', 'customers', 'effect', 'Racewear', 'start', 'rest', 'completion', 'investments', 'publication', 'lG9sk8qblGuYm2qcYshonJdnmG9nxWXFapeWlGKdap', 'Ym3GSyZxibMmXZnFml2dq', 'accounts', 'results', 'Full', 'PDF', 'email']",2024-04-23,2024-04-24,marketscreener.com

Conducted by the agency Utopies  it extends a pilot study carried out in 2019 on the French territory.Since 1964  JCDecaux has championed its virtuous model to design  install and maintain infrastructure (bus shelters  self-cleaning public toilets  self-service bikes  etc.) in public spaces and transport areas  with their useful and innovative services  financed by brand communication.True to its mission to sustainably improve the quality of life for all citizens through proximity and mobility  JCDecaux sought to accurately measure its contribution to the economic and social development of its operating environments by conducting an independent study using concrete and audited data.Present in more than 80 countries and with over 11 000 employees worldwide  JCDecaux commissioned the French agency Utopies to assess the contribution of its model  products  services and business lines on a global scale.JCDecaux  a sustainable media with a business model that is virtuous in three waysSocially  the study illustrates JCDecaux's significant contribution to supporting job creation and protection  both worldwide and in France.Conducted on an unprecedented global scale  the Utopies study demonstrates JCDecaux's positive socioeconomic footprint in all its operating locations: in 2022  the Group's business activities supported almost 120 000 jobs around the world (41% of this figure in Europe).For each direct job created by JCDecaux  9.7 additional jobs are supported in the global economy.In France  JCDecaux's business activities supported nearly 14 700 jobs on the national territory in 2022  including more than 3 100 direct jobs. More than 3 200 indirect jobs have also been supported in JCDecaux’s French value chain  represented by 1 700 suppliers including 70% VSEs and SMEs. For each job created by JCDecaux  3.6 additional jobs are supported in the national economy.Economically  JCDecaux Group shares nearly 50% of the resources it develops to finance living spaces and transport facilities (value redistributed to cities  transport companies  airports  shopping centres and private landlords  as well as States and local communities). Through its investments  innovations  street furniture and communication systems that provides useful information to citizens  consumers and users  JCDecaux contributes towards developing and boosting local areas without burdening public finances.Environmentally  JCDecaux's three key activities – namely  bus shelters  land transport and self-service bikes – meet the challenge of climate change mitigation by promoting sustainable mobility across the globe. For this reason  nearly 50% of the Group's revenue is now aligned with the European Green Taxonomy.JCDecaux  a responsible and committed playerSince the company’s foundation in 1964  JCDecaux has been strongly committed to a sustainable business model  that respects the environment and is also socially responsible. In June 2023  the Company unveiled its new Climate Strategy  ""committed SBTi""  including targets to continue reducing its carbon footprint across its entire value chain. Based on three principles – Measure  Reduce and Contribute beyond the Group's value chain –  the strategy aims for Net Zero Carbon by 2050 (scopes 1  2 and 3). It serves to complement the Company's ambitious 2030 ESG Strategy.JCDecaux's long-term expanded commitment to the environment and the public interest  has come to the fore at a time when  all over the world  public procurement with its new criteria for sustainability is accelerating both the ecological transition and the economic rebound. The recent evolution of legislation in France - Climate and Resilience Law  new Public Procurement Code  Green Industry Law - makes it possible to progress towards more responsible public procurement.JCDecaux's ESG performance is recognised by global-leading extra-financial rating agencies such as CDP  with the Group reaching Leadership level and securing a place on its A list. Day in  day out  whether in public spaces  transport or retail areas  JCDecaux highlights its determination to respond to the challenges of climate change  making outdoor advertising into a media that accelerates the ecological transition and street furniture a driver of regional transformation. This commitment is central to the Company's partnership with the United Nations Joint Sustainable Development Goals Fund (Joint SDG Fund) signed in January 2023  which seeks to mobilise public and private stakeholders in their initiatives for human progress that is at once economic  environmental and societal.Jean-François Decaux  Chairman of the Executive Board and Co-CEO of JCDecaux  said: “Since our company was founded  JCDecaux has adopted a responsible approach  placing sustainable development at the heart of its company strategy. Through our products and services  and culture of innovation  we are transforming the company from an ecological  economic and social standpoint  and the same ambition applies to our stakeholders and supply partners. The ecological and social transition will accelerate the potential for innovation  growth and employment  by activating the decisive lever of sustainable public procurement - following the example of the advances contained in the recent French Climate & Resilience and Green Industry laws. In France and in the world and for the economy as a whole  extra-financial criteria  whether social or environmental  must be more systematically evaluated in public procurement so that  in a qualitative approach  the value of a product or service is not reduced to price alone. By renewing this study to measure our socioeconomic footprint  we are reiterating our commitment to transparency and further demonstrating our contribution to the development of services for cities and transport partners that benefit citizens and stakeholders everywhere we operate. The results of this latest study underline the utility and public service provided by JCDecaux worldwide and in France.

(Euronext Paris: CNV; ISIN: NL0010949392) (“Cnova” or the “Company”) has published its annual financial report for the year ended December 31  2023 (the “report”). The report was filed with the Dutch Authority for the Financial Markets (Autoriteit Financiële Markten) and is available on the Company’s website  www.cnova.com.KPMG Accountants N.V. have issued an unqualified audit opinion in relation to the report. In the report  the Company notes that its capital structure in relation to its debts could compromise the Company's mid-term business plan  particularly after 2025  when certain debts (all as identified in the report in more detail) become unsecured. The Company has initiated discussions with Casino  Guichard-Perrachon about a potential conversion of (part of) the Company's debt vis-à-vis Casino into equity. Because no decision has been made about the implementation of this debt-to-equity conversion  there is currently a material uncertainty on Cnova’s ability to continue as a going concern after 2025.Despite the identified material uncertainty  the Board of Directors expects a positive outcome of discussions with its main shareholder about the recapitalization  although the outcome remains uncertain. Therefore  the Board of Directors of Cnova considered it appropriate to have prepared the 2023 year-end consolidated financial statements under the going concern assumption.***About Cnova N.V.Cnova N.V.  the French ecommerce leader  serves 7.2 million active customers via its state-of-the-art website  Cdiscount.

The financial statements  approved by the Board of Directors on 17 April 2024  have been audited and the reports are currently being prepared. Airwell delivered excellent results in the 2023 financial year with record revenue of €65.0m  up 17%  and an EBITDA margin of 4.8%  generally in line with the announced target[1]. The Group's financial position remains solid and strong.French standards(€m) – unaudited 2022 2023 Change (%) Revenue 55.7 65.0 +16.7% EBITDA[2] 1.8 3.1 +71.4% EBITDA margin 3.3% 4.8% +1.5 points EBIT[3] 1.5 2.2 +50.9% Net profit 1.0 1.4 +37.2%Laurent Roegel  Airwell CEO  commented: “Our full-year 2023 results were significantly up  in line with our expectations. This performance recognises the outstanding efforts of our teams  confirming our status as a player committed to the challenges of energy renovation  implementing solutions that fully cater to our markets. In 2024  despite a less favourable market environment  we expect double-digit revenue growth  and a much improved second-half versus the first. What's more  we will step up our investments  particularly in Airwell Industrie  to bolster our portfolio of directly owned products while continuing our trajectory aimed at transforming Airwell into an established European leader in the years ahead.”Strong increase in operating performance indicatorsAt end 2023 financial year  the Airwell Group generated consolidated revenue of €65.0m  representing a strong year-on-year increase of 16.7%. This progress was driven by the excellent performance in the residential market  with sustained demand in Air-Water Heat Pumps  most notably in France which was the Group's leading market in 2023.Gross margin totalled €21.3m  up considerably by 22.8% from the previous financial year. It came out to 32.7%  versus 31.1% a year ago  representing a 1.6-point increase owing to the regional mix (with France as the top contributor).Overall  current operating expenses were still kept under control  increasing 16.8% to €18.0m vs. €15.4m the previous year. Supply and distribution costs returned to more normal levels (€3.0m vs. €3.9m last year) to offset rising marketing/R&D and sales costs in line with the business growth observed over the year.EBITDA[4] stood at €3.1m (vs. €1.8m in 2022)  a substantial increase of 71.4%. EBITDA margin came out to 4.8%  generally aligning with the announced target of 5%[5]. It includes a post-audit accounting impact of €0.2m for inventories changes within Airwell Industrie  reclassified as goodwill. Excluding this non-cash accounting impact  the EBITDA margin would amount to 5.1%.After depreciation and amortisation  EBIT[6] surged 50.9% to €2.2m vs. €1.5m in H1 2022.Net financial loss increased to -€0.9m (vs. -€0.4m for FY 2022)  including interest on the €5.0m bond issue with Delta AM in January 2023.After accounting corporate income tax (€0.2m)  net profit totalled €1.4m (vs. €1.0m a year earlier)  with a net margin of 37.2%.Sound financial structureAt 31 December 2023  Airwell's equity amounted to €10.7m versus €3.9m at 31 December 2022  notably strengthened by the capital increase of €6.1m issued in June as part of the transfer of Group shares to Euronext Growth® Paris.Cash flow from operating activities of integrated companies totalled €2.2m  representing brisk year-on-year growth of 77.2%.Cash flow from operating activities totalled €(6.1)m at end-December 2023  compared to €0.9m on 31 December 2022. This included a one-off €8.3m increase in WCR (working capital requirement)  owing to a €2.8m change in finished products (including €0.5m from Airwell Industrie) and a one-off decrease in trade payables (exceptionally early payments to a number of suppliers).Cash flow from investing activities amounted to €(1.6)m. It was mainly geared towards R&D investments  with a focus on the Air Home application  fittings and IT expenditure for the head office premises as well as a new showroom in Guadeloupe. This compares with a net inflow of €0.4m on 31 December 2022 (including exceptional income from the disposal of the Johnson brand).Cash flow from financing activities totalled €9.2m (vs. €(1.1)m at 31 December 2022)  including the capital increase (€6.1m gross)  the €5.0m bond issue  and the repayment of a €1.3m bank loan over the period.Gross financial debt was €7.6m (vs. €3.8m at 31 December 2022). At end-2023  net debt remained under full control at €4.2m  representing gearing[7] of 39%.2024: double-digit revenue growth and continued investmentsFactoring in a less buoyant heat pump market worldwide  due to the crisis in new construction  the Airwell Group aims to continue outperforming the market through its positioning in global renovation segment and its standout solutions.The Group targets double-digit growth in full-year 2024 revenue compared with 2023  propelled by the good momentum in France.However  in the 2024 financial year  growth will not be linear. On the back of a 15% decline in the first quarter resulting from particularly high comparatives and delayed export sales in connection with distributor stock adjustments and extended international shipping times  the trend will gradually improve in the quarters ahead  with significant acceleration expected in the second half.Airwell's steady sales momentum in France will be underpinned by a growing sales force  the contribution of Airwell Industrie  the launch of new offerings including a servicing solution for smart  connected homes (“Ma Maison Hybride”) and a financing package for energy-related renovations in the residential sector.Parallel to this  2024 will see the Group sustain a high level of investment (around €2.5m to €3m) with a particular focus on Airwell Industrie to prepare for new offerings and being part of the key challenges involved in Made in France.Lastly  Airwell restates its ambitions for 2025 to generate revenue of more than €100m  with an EBITDA margin in excess of 5%.Next release: Revenue for the first quarter of 2024  Tuesday 14 May 2024About AirwellFounded in 1947 in France  Airwell is France's leading designer of heat pumps in the field of climatic and thermal engineering.

Portfolio performance and fair value movements: Portfolio companies continue to maintain revenue growth momentum  demonstrating the underlying resilience of these businesses and the structural demand for their products across their respective end-markets.Total fair value movements in the second half of £55 million arose mainly from the Forward Partners and Seedcamp Fund III portfolio acquisitions  offset by adverse FX movements of £19m. These aside  valuations across both our Core and Emerging portfolio assets have held essentially flat in aggregate in the second half.Our portfolio remains well funded with over 90% of the Core projecting more than 12 months of cash runway  and over 50% projecting greater than 24 months. Outlook for FY25 (year to 31 March 2025): We have continued to make strategic progress in enhancing our platform and believe Molten is well-positioned to generate returns for our investors. We have the skillset  market positioning and the firepower available to capture opportunities while market valuations remain subdued.FY25 showing promise of delivering a more normalised realisations market with divestment proceeds expected to be meaningfully higher than the last two years.A continued focus on our third-party capital strategy to be spearheaded by a newly hired head of third-party funds.

The annual report for the financial year 2023 has been published on Sequana Medical's website and can be accessed here.The items on the agendas of the meetings include (among other) the proposed approval of a number of resolutions relating to the financial year ended 31 December 2023  the proposed approval of the revised remuneration policy  the proposed reappointment of the statutory auditor  the application of Article 7:151 of the Belgian Companies and Associations Code  the proposed contribution in kind of certain receivables pursuant to the unsecured and subordinated convertible loan agreement entered into on 7 February 2024 between the Company and Partners in Equity and Rosetta Capital (the ""Lenders"") in the principal amount of EUR 3 041 507.59 (the ""Convertible Loan Agreement"") and the resulting proposed share capital increase  as well as the renewal of the authorization to the Board of Directors to increase the share capital within the framework of the authorised capital.The Annual and Extraordinary General Meetings of Shareholders will take place at the Company's registered offices in Ghent and will start at 09:00 am CET. The full convening notice with the agenda and proposed resolutions can be accessed on the Sequana Medical website: www.sequanamedical.com/investors/shareholder-information.The Company recommends the holders of its securities to use e-mail for all communications with the Company regarding the Annual and Extraordinary General Meetings of Shareholders. The Company's e-mail address for such communications is: IR@sequanamedical.com.Disclosures in accordance with Article 7:97  §4/1 of the Belgian Companies and Associations CodeThe following information is provided  in as far as needed and applicable  pursuant to Article 7:97  §4/1 of the Belgian Companies and Associations Code in connection with the proposed contribution in kind to the share capital of the Company of the receivables that are or will be due by the Company under the Convertible Loan Agreement to the Lenders (the ""Convertible Receivables"") (the ""Transaction"").Partners in Equity and Rosetta Capital are both shareholders of the Company and are represented on the board of directors of the Company. As a result  Partners in Equity and Rosetta Capital could each be considered as a ""related party"" in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards  as adopted by the European Union (IFRS)  as referred to in Article 7:97 of the Belgian Companies and Associations Code. In view hereof  and in accordance with paragraph 2  1° of Article 7:97 of the Belgian Companies and Associations Code  the board of directors of the Company has applied the procedure of Article 7:97 of the Belgian Companies and Associations Code in connection with the contemplated proposal of the board of directors to the extraordinary general meeting to contribute in kind the Convertible Receivables to the share capital of the Company. Ids van der Weij (a director of the Company representing Partners in Equity) and Kenneth Macleod (a director of the Company representing Rosetta Capital) did not participate in the deliberation and voting by the board of directors of the Company in relation to the approval of the Transaction.Consequently  a committee of three independent directors of the Company (the ""Committee"") issued an advice to the board of directors in which the Committee has assessed the proposal to the extraordinary general meeting to contribute in kind the Convertible Receivables. In its advice to the board of directors  the Committee concluded the following:""The Committee believes that (i) under the then existing circumstances and taking into account the then existing immediate working capital needs of the Company as well as the then available financing options  the provisions of the Convertible Loan Agreement  including the agreed provisions relating to the (mandatory) contribution in kind of Convertible Receivables  were in the interest of the Company  its shareholders and other stakeholders  given that without the Convertible Loan Agreement  the Company may not have been able to meet its short-term financing needs and the going concern of the Company could no longer be guaranteed; (ii) the proposed contribution in kind is in the interest of the Company  its shareholders and creditors  given that via the proposed contribution in kind the Company (x) can meet its obligation to settle the Convertible Receivables without having to use existing or new funds (in cash)  which it can use to finance working capital needs and  in particular  the further development of its products and clinical trials  (y) reduce its indebtedness  and (z) improve its net equity position (as the amount of the share capital is strengthened); (iii) while an additional and significant potential dilution will be incurred by the holders of shares and share options of the Company as a result of the Transaction (in particular because of the agreed conversion price representing a high discount compared to the price of the Company's existing shares as they are currently traded at the date of this advice)  the Transaction does not seem to be unreasonable and seems to be commensurate to the risks of investing in the Company and  in particular  the risks and opportunity costs of the Lenders to agree to the Convertible Loan Agreement).After consideration  the Committee is therefore of the opinion that the expected benefits of the proposed contribution in kind  taking into account the context in which this obligation had arisen  are in balance with the expected risks and disadvantages thereof. Accordingly  the Committee is of the opinion that the Transaction is in the interest of the Company  and in any event is not manifestly unlawful.In light of this  the Committee provides a favourable and approving advice to the board of directors of the Company.""The board of directors of the Company did not deviate from the Committee's favourable and approving conclusion. The assessment by the Company's statutory auditor of the Committee's advice and the minutes of the meeting of the board of directors of the Company relating to the Transaction  is as follows:""Based on our assessment  nothing has come to our attention that leads us to believe that the financial and accounting information mentioned in the advice of the Ad Hoc Committee of independent directors dated 19 April 2024 and in the minutes of the board meeting dated 19 April 2024  which justify the intended transaction in writing and substantially  are not  in all material respects  fair and sufficient with the information available to us within the scope of our engagement. Our engagement was solely conducted within the framework of Article 7:97 of the Belgian Companies and Associations Code  and therefore our report cannot be used in any other context.""For more information  please contact:Sequana MedicalIan CrosbieChief Executive OfficerE: IR@sequanamedical.comT: +44 7973 42 99 17About Sequana MedicalSequana Medical NV is a pioneer in treating fluid overload  a serious and frequent clinical complication in patients with liver disease  heart failure and cancer. This causes major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care  they become ineffective  untolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing ""diuretic-resistant"" patient population.alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  delivering major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients and reducing costs for healthcare systems.The Company's Premarket Approval (PMA) application for the alfapump was submitted to the US FDA in December 2023 and accepted for substantive review in January 2024  having reported positive primary and secondary endpoint data from the North American pivotal POSEIDON study in recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis. US market approval of the alfapump is anticipated by the end of Q3 2024.Results of the Company's RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure support DSR's mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE  a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study  have been successfully treated with DSR  resulting in a dramatic improvement in diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements. The independent Data Safety Monitoring Board approved the start of the randomized MOJAVE cohort of up to a further 30 patients  which is planned after alfapump US PMA approval.Sequana Medical is listed on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent  Belgium.

Refer to Annex 3 for a reconciliation of non-IFRS performance measures.New orders of €698 million in Q1 2024 increased by 10% at constant currencies (increased by 8% as reported)  supported by healthy GAA 2nm orders  and a strong increase in memory orders  mainly for HBM-related DRAM applications.Revenue of €639 million decreased by 8% at constant currencies (decreased by 10% as reported) from Q1 of last year but came in at the high end of guidance (€600-640 million).Adjusted gross profit margin increased to 52.9%  up from 51.1% in Q1 of last year  on the back of a generally positive mix  and in particular a continued strong contribution from China sales  which increased to a quarterly record.Adjusted operating result margin decreased to 30.0%  compared to 31.2% in Q1 last year. This was mainly explained by the decrease in revenue and partly offset by the increase in gross profit margin  while the increase in operating expenses was relatively moderate in Q1.Revenue for Q2 2024 is projected to increase to €660-700 million. Revenue in H2 is expected to increase by 10% or more compared to H1 2024. Full year 2024 is expected to be another year of growth for ASM.Comment“ASM started the year on a solid footing”  said Benjamin Loh  CEO of ASM. “Revenue in the first quarter came in at €639 million  which was a decrease of 8% compared to the same quarter of last year. Revenue was at the top end of our guidance of €600-640 million.Bookings increased to €698 million  up 10% at constant currencies from the first quarter 2023. Bookings again included a healthy level of tool orders related to the gate-all-around (GAA) 2nm technology node. Current traction confirms our expectation that the GAA migration is going to be a strong driver for ASM. Memory bookings showed a solid increase compared to a lower level of last year  for the larger part driven by HBM-related demand for high-performance DRAM applications. In addition  bookings from the Chinese market remained at a strong level in the first quarter. Order intake in power/analog/wafer (excluding silicon carbide Epi) continued to be relatively low  reflecting the soft conditions in this market segment.Gross margin increased to 52.9% compared to 51.1% in the first quarter of last year  on the back of a generally positive mix  and in particular continued strong sales from China with above-average profitability. The operating profit margin decreased slightly from 31.2% to 30.0%. Operating expenses increased by a moderate 3% compared to the first quarter of last year.”OutlookWhile market conditions are still mixed in the first part of the year  we expect the recovery in wafer fab equipment (WFE) spending to gradually pick up speed in the remainder of the year. We expect revenue in the second quarter of 2024  at constant currencies  to increase to a range of €660-700 million  which is higher than we indicated with our Q4 report.We now project ASM’s revenue in the second half to increase 10% or more compared to the first half  at constant currencies. With that  we expect 2024 to be another growth year for ASM. We still expect sales from the Chinese market in the second half to be lower  but the decrease will be more moderate than we previously anticipated. Sales in advanced logic/foundry  mainly for GAA  and in the memory segment are expected to be higher in the second half.In part supported by previously announced new customer wins we still expect our silicon carbide (SiC) Epi sales to increase by a meaningful double-digit percentage in 2024. However  this growth will be somewhat slower than we expected at the start of the year  as some SiC customers have recently been pushing out new investments.We reiterate our revenue target for 2025 (range of €3.0-3.6 billion)  driven by an expected rebound in the WFE market  including the move of GAA 2nm technology into high-volume manufacturing in 2025  and a further recovery in the memory markets.Annual General MeetingOn March 26  2024  ASM published the agenda  convocation  and other materials for the 2024 Annual General Meeting (AGM)  to be held on May 13  2024  in Almere  which as also earlier announced  includes  amongst other things  approvals of:the annual accounts of 2023;the proposal to declare a regular dividend of €2.75 per common share;the reappointment of Mr. Lamouche and the appointment of Ms. Micki and Mr. Van den Brink as members of the Supervisory Board;the appointment of Ernst & Young Accountants LLP as auditor for the financial year 2025;a change of the remuneration policy for  and remuneration of  the Supervisory Board;a proposal to withdraw common shares; and an amendment to ASM’s articles of association.Please refer to the AGM documents available on our website for more detailed information.About ASMASM International N.V.  headquartered in Almere  the Netherlands  and its subsidiaries design and manufacture equipment and process solutions to produce semiconductor devices for wafer processing  and have facilities in the United States  Europe  and Asia.

(Anellotech) today announced they have signed a global joint development agreement to work cooperatively to further develop and then license Anellotech's Plas-TCat™ process  a one-step thermal-catalytic recycling technology that converts mixed plastic wastes back into its constituent basic chemicals  with a specific focus to benzene  toluene  and xylene (BTX) that can be used to make most virgin plastics.The companies will bring their combined process technology expertise and know-how to complete comprehensive performance trials at Anellotech's 100 tonnes/year nameplate feed rate demonstration plant in Silsbee  Texas. It will incorporate Technip Energies' downstream processing units  leading to a process design for use by Technip Energies in its role as the global Plas-TCat™ licensor.The Plas-TCat™ process can feed all major plastics with predictable end-product yields. This process can reduce CO2 emission up to 50% compared to the production of virgin monomers in naphtha crackers.Bhaskar Patel  SVP Sustainable Fuels  Chemicals and Circularity at Technip Energies said: Technip Energies is delighted to work with Anellotech to advance the Plas-TCat™ process. Anellotech's technology brings a new pathway towards solving the plastic waste problem  converting the mixed plastic wastes into useful end products. For us  this is another opportunity to contribute to the circular economy  including now in Japan.David Sudolsky  Founder  President and CEO of Anellotech  stated Anellotech looks forward to engaging with Technip Energies  a global leader in petrochemical  fluid catalytic cracking  refining and steam cracker technologies. This collaboration will provide the scalable  cost-efficient  attractive LCA solution needed to address plastic sustainability. Together with our strategic funding partner R Plus Japan Ltd.  we will work towards accelerating the global licensing and commercialization of the Plas-TCat™ process.here or remove ads . 3rd party Ad.

Sales totalled €693.6 million  up 39.5% compared with €497.3 in 2022  as a result of the low level of departures at the start of 2022 (effect of Covid in the first quarter of 2022)  the integration of acquisitions made in June 2022 and very high demand for travel in 2023. However  the economic and geopolitical climate – with the war in Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East – remains uncertain.On an historical basis (excluding acquisitions made in 2022)  sales were 16.5% higher than in 2019  which remains the benchmark. Tailor-made travel saw growth of 19.3%  while adventure travel was up 10.8%. In addition  foreign customers now account for 35% of total sales.The new cycling holidays business enjoyed strong growth  accounting for 16% of the Group’s total sales and around 38% of customers. A large number of travellers are now using alternative means of transport to air travel. The Group has rolled out a major awareness campaign with the aim of cutting CO2 emissions  suggesting train travel  direct flights or use of the latest planes whenever possible.RESULTSEBITDA totalled €64.7 million in 2023  up 25.7% relative to 2022 (up 92.6% relative to 2019). Net income attributable to owners of the parent was €44.1 million  up 47.6% relative to 2022 (up 117.8% relative to 2019).These results attest to tight control of costs and the Group’s ability to maintain its gross margin. During this period of inflation  this was achieved thanks to the high level of added value and the many services offered to customers of all the Group’s companies  with its well-known brands benefiting from a solid reputation and excellent image.CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITYFollowing two years impacted by the public health crisis  in 2023 the Group managed to pass on more of its earnings to employees than in 2019. A total of 21% of wealth created by the Group  or €18 million  was paid out to employees in the form of profit sharing  incentive schemes and bonuses.As regards the environment  the Group continued with the efforts initiated more than 10 years ago focusing on two main priorities: using all possible ways of reducing the carbon impact of its operations  and offsetting any residual emissions through reforestation projects. The additional and long-term features of these projects have been certified by international organisations and enable the Group to offset all carbon emissions associated with travel and most of its operations.OUTLOOKAs at 22 April 2024  2024 booked departures (change expressed relative to 2023 booked departures as of the same date) were up 8.2%. At the same date in 2023  the booked departures represented 72% of the total 2023 departures. Growth has waned since the start of the year as a result of a particularly strong performance in 2023  creating a significant base effect for 2024.In France  the Group will continue to improve its service offerings across all its brands. All adventure travel brands will continue to incorporate cycling holidays as an additional business following the acquisition of Eurofun Group.Outside France  the Group is still looking into opportunities for acquisitions in its historical business lines.The Board of Directors approved the 2023 financial statements at 3:45 p.m. on 23 April 2024.Reminder:The Group is market leader in France in tailor-made travel (56% of 2023 sales)  with the Voyageurs du Monde  Comptoir des Voyages  Bynativ and Original Travel brands  and in adventure travel (28% of 2023 sales)  with the Terres d'Aventure  Allibert Trekking  Nomade Aventure and KE Adventure Travel brands  as well as in cycling holidays (16% of 2023 sales) with the main brands EuroFun Touristik  Loire Valley Travel  Radweg Raisen  SE Tours and Ruckenwind Reisen.The shares (ALVDM FR0004045847) are admitted to trading on the Euronext Growth market and eligible for PEA PME savings plans.Contacts:Voyageurs du Monde Lionel Habasque  Deputy CEO  T: 01 53 73 77 09Email: lhabasque@terdav.comAlain Capestan  Deputy CEO  T: 01 42 86 16 57Email: acapestan@voyageursdumonde.fr,positive,0.87,0.12,0.01,mixed,0.47,0.14,0.38,True,English,"['Voyageurs du Monde', 'Excellent 2023 results', 'line', 'estimates', 'PEA PME savings plans', 'new cycling holidays business', 'KE Adventure Travel brands', 'Voyageurs du Monde group', 'major awareness campaign', 'CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY', 'public health crisis', 'historical business lines', 'Loire Valley Travel', 'two main priorities', 'significant base effect', 'Original Travel brands', 'Euronext Growth market', 'main brands', 'historical basis', 'two years', 'market leader', 'BUSINESS ACTIVITY', 'Tailor-made travel', 'air travel', 'train travel', 'additional business', 'Press release', 'Consolidated figures', 'Operating expenses', 'Net income', 'sharp upturn', 'low level', 'first quarter', 'high demand', 'geopolitical climate', 'Middle East', 'large number', 'alternative means', 'CO2 emissions', 'direct flights', 'latest planes', 'tight control', 'gross margin', 'high level', 'added value', 'many services', 'solid reputation', 'excellent image', 'profit sharing', 'incentive schemes', 'possible ways', 'carbon impact', 'residual emissions', 'long-term features', 'international organisations', 'carbon emissions', 'same date', 'strong performance', 'service offerings', 'The Board', '2023 financial statements', 'Comptoir des', 'Allibert Trekking', 'EuroFun Touristik', 'Radweg Raisen', 'SE Tours', 'Ruckenwind Reisen', 'Lionel Habasque', 'Deputy CEO', 'Alain Capestan', 'strong growth', 'reforestation projects', 'Nomade Aventure', 'The Group', 'Eurofun Group', 'Excellent 2023 results', 'foreign customers', 'total sales', 'total 2023 departures', '19 Sales', '2023 sales', 'Paris', '23 April', 'estimates', 'Change', 'EBITDA', 'owners', 'parent', 'earnings', 'interest', 'taxes', 'depreciation', 'amortisation', 'backdrop', 'start', 'Covid', 'integration', 'acquisitions', 'June', 'economic', 'Ukraine', 'conflict', 'benchmark', 'travellers', 'transport', 'aim', 'use', 'costs', 'ability', 'period', 'inflation', 'companies', 'employees', 'wealth', 'environment', 'efforts', 'operations', 'OUTLOOK', '22 April', 'France', 'opportunities', 'Directors', 'Reminder', 'Voyages', 'Bynativ', 'Terres', 'shares', 'ALVDM', 'Contacts', 'Email', 'lhabasque', 'terdav', 'acapestan', 'voyageursdumonde', '2022', '2024', '3:45', '01']",2024-04-23,2024-04-24,marketscreener.com

However  the Americas and the APAC region remain resilient  bringing the backlog to €19 million in Q1 2024  representing an increase by +35%. Now looking ahead  BALYO will focus on further implementing its commercial ambitions to get back to growth  with emphasis on direct sales in order to ensure its commercial autonomy. Thanks to the shareholder loan obtained from its majority shareholder earlier this year  BALYO now has the financial means to pursue its activity and will maintain very tight control over its costs to preserve its cash position.”In thousands of euros Q1 2023 Q1 2024 Change EMEA Region 5 736 3 235 -44% Region Americas 1 388 1 591 +15% APAC Region 104 422 +307% Sales revenue* 7 228 5 247 -27%* Unaudited dataQ1 2024 sales and activityIn the first quarter of 2024  BALYO recorded sales at €5.2 million  compared to €7.2 million in Q1 2023  down -27%. This decrease is due to an unfavorable effect on the base comparison. For the record  first quarter 2023 sales had benefited from the commitment order contract with Linde Material Handling. By region  a lower activity is thus observed in the EMEA region over the first quarter 2024  where BALYO generated sales of €3.2 million  a decrease by -44%. Sales in the United States and the APAC region grew by +15% and +307% respectively.In the first quarter of 2024  order intake declined by -79%  reaching €1.9 million  compared to €8.9 million in Q1 2023. After integrating new orders  the backlog sets at €19 million as of March 31  2024  up +35% over March 31  2023. The geographical breakdown shows substantial growth both in the United States (+132%) and the APAC region (+239%).Financial position and outlookOn March 31  2024  BALYO’s cash position stood at €3.5 million  compared to €8.6 million as of December 31  2023. This cash position corresponds to the cash and cash equivalents item in the consolidated financial statements.Over the course of the first quarter  BALYO successfully secured a Shareholder Loan with SoftBank Group  its indirect majority shareholder  for a total amount of up to €12 million  which has been signed on March 21  2024. This loan  which may be repaid by offsetting of receivables as part of a capital increase  is subject to covenants on revenue and operating cash-flow that will be audited every quarter.Regarding its cash position and after taking into account the remaining convertible bonds issuances with SoftBank Group (of €2 million)  the postponement of payment deadlines to end of 2024 granted to BALYO by one of its main suppliers (a time period depending on orders received during the financial year which may be postponed beyond this deadline)  the record of a $7.8 million order intake  which generated a down payment of 50% of this amount end of 2023  and the shareholder loan granted by SoftBank Group  BALYO has now the necessary financial means to fund its activities until at least the end of 2024.Given these factors  BALYO will focus on working in the rebound of its commercial momentum in 2024  by leveraging on its model based on direct sales  while maintaining very tight control over its costs to preserve its cash position.Annual General Meeting: June 13  2024Next BALYO financial announcement: first half 2024 sales revenue  on July 18  2024 after market closing.About BALYOHumans around the World deserve enriching and creative jobs.

Indeed  last year Q1 sales were spurred by Linde (NYSE: ) Material's commitment  which explains in part the decline of the activity in Europe. However  the Americas and the APAC region remain resilient  bringing the backlog to €19 million in Q1 2024  representing an increase by +35%. Now looking ahead  BALYO will focus on further implementing its commercial ambitions to get back to growth  with emphasis on direct sales in order to ensure its commercial autonomy. Thanks to the shareholder loan obtained from its majority shareholder earlier this year  BALYO now has the financial means to pursue its activity and will maintain very tight control over its costs to preserve its cash position.In thousands of euros Q1 2023 Q1 2024 Change EMEA Region 5 736 3 235 -44% Region Americas 1 388 1 591 +15% APAC Region 104 422 +307% Sales revenue 7 228 5 247 -27%Unaudited dataQ1 2024 sales and activityIn the first quarter of 2024  BALYO recorded sales at €5.2 million  compared to €7.2 million in Q1 2023  down -27%. This decrease is due to an unfavorable effect on the base comparison. For the record  first quarter 2023 sales had benefited from the commitment order contract with Linde Material Handling. By region  a lower activity is thus observed in the EMEA region over the first quarter 2024  where BALYO generated sales of €3.2 million  a decrease by -44%. Sales in the United States and the APAC region grew by +15% and +307% respectively.here or remove ads . 3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com. See disclosureorIn the first quarter of 2024  order intake declined by -79%  reaching €1.9 million  compared to €8.9 million in Q1 2023. After integrating new orders  the backlog sets at €19 million as of March 31  2024  up +35% over March 31  2023. The geographical breakdown shows substantial growth both in the United States (+132%) and the APAC region (+239%).Financial position and outlookOn March 31  2024  BALYO's cash position stood at €3.5 million  compared to €8.6 million as of December 31  2023. This cash position corresponds to the cash and cash equivalents item in the consolidated financial statements.Over the course of the first quarter  BALYO successfully secured a Shareholder Loan with SoftBank (TYO: ) Group  its indirect majority shareholder  for a total amount of up to €12 million  which has been signed on March 21  2024. This loan  which may be repaid by offsetting of receivables as part of a capital increase  is subject to covenants on revenue and operating cash-flow that will be audited every quarter.Regarding its cash position and after taking into account the remaining convertible bonds issuances with SoftBank Group (of €2 million)  the postponement of payment deadlines to end of 2024 granted to BALYO by one of its main suppliers (a time period depending on orders received during the financial year which may be postponed beyond this deadline)  the record of a $7.8 million order intake  which generated a down payment of 50% of this amount end of 2023  and the shareholder loan granted by SoftBank Group  BALYO has now the necessary financial means to fund its activities until at least the end of 2024.here or remove ads . 3rd party Ad.

As the MMSD's long standing operating partner  Veolia is designating Milwaukee as its first Ecofactory in America and will use its successes to inspire similar transformation in other cities across the country.Karine RougÃ©  CEO of Veolia North America's Municipal Water division  said  ""Veolia is thrilled to partner with MMSD to launch the Ecofactory initiative in Milwaukee  a city that has long exemplified how to treat the environment responsibly and find creative ways to turn waste into resources. This collaboration represents a significant step forward in our shared commitment to sustainability and community engagement. By combining our expertise and resources  we can continue to create a more resilient and resourceful water infrastructure for Milwaukee and its residents  helping them cut carbon emissions  find value in wastewater and build stronger communities.here or remove ads . 3rd party Ad.

I am pleased Veolia is building on the work of MMSD as it advances the Ecofactory concept. And  I look forward to additional partnerships to advance our common goals.Kevin Shafer  Executive Director of the MMSD  said  I could not be more humbled or proud to gather on this Earth Day to honor decades of innovation and the forward thinking that's created a highly successful agency to protect public health and our source of drinking water  Lake Michigan.Ecofactory approach creates new environmental opportunitiesDesignating Milwaukee's wastewater treatment system as an Ecofactory marks a significant achievement for the MMSD and a new approach in America for Veolia  which is working across the country to reimagine how wastewater treatment can benefit communities. As the top-ranked company for environmental services  Veolia intends to make the most of its global expertise to help America meet its need for sustainable growth. Last week  the group announced its ambition to double its size in the country by 2030.An Ecofactory maximizes the value of the materials produced at a wastewater treatment system  such as reclaimed water used for agriculture or irrigation; waste heat or biogas used for energy; biosolids used for fertilizer; and even energy produced from on-site solar panels. An Ecofactory also optimizes those processes to operate as efficiently as possible  reducing greenhouse gas emissions  energy use and waste. And an Ecofactory consciously incorporates environmental and community stewardship from the start: Protecting biodiversity  strengthening climate resilience and creating new opportunities for green jobs and economic sustainability.here or remove ads . 3rd party Ad.

See disclosureorVeolia has pioneered the Ecofactory approach in other operating markets  working with existing systems to boost their benefits and transform their roles within communities. In Santiago  Chile  Veolia's Ecofactory recovers 310 gigawatt-hours of energy from wastewater to eliminate waste  fossil energy and pollution from its treatment process. In Granada  Spain  all 4.8 billion gallons of wastewater treated at Veolia's Ecofactory are reused for irrigation. With people across the planet demanding action to preserve the world's resources and counter a changing climate  the Ecofactory framework is bringing practical solutions to the common challenges that communities face everywhere.Milwaukee leads in treating wastewater as a resourceThe MMSD has taken an innovative approach to wastewater treatment for nearly a century  adopting a then-novel European treatment process in 1925 that used microorganisms to feed on organic materials in wastewater and transformed them into Milorganite ® fertilizer. Building on this impressive track record  Veolia and MMSD are exploring new opportunities to enhance Milwaukee's water infrastructure through the Ecofactory approach. Focusing on technical initiatives such as increased beneficial reuse  solar energy production and biogas generation  the Ecofactory partnership aims to maximize the regenerative and decarbonizing potential of wastewater treatment  such as expanding solar resources to help operate with 100 percent renewable energy by 2035.Veolia and MMSD support community infrastructureThe Ecofactory initiative goes beyond technical advancements to recognize how the MMSD and Veolia have engaged deeply with Milwaukee's communities  neighborhoods and needs. Together they have focused on recruiting local workers from underrepresented areas of Milwaukee and are increasing efforts to support workforce grant initiatives  offer formal apprenticeships and increase access to Veolia's internal workforce development program.here or remove ads . 3rd party Ad.

It includes the Lynyrd Skymmr boat that cruises Milwaukee's waterways to skim floating debris from the surface and improve water quality in the rivers and harbor.The Ecofactory in Milwaukee is set to become a model for sustainable water management and community involvement.

The Board believes this focus will likely bring the greatest potential return for shareholders.Following completion of the market assessment of its Knowledge Exploration Tools  as noted at the time of the Company's full year results on 14 March 2024  work on the Knowledge Exploration Tools will cease  given the investment needed to fully commercialise this SaaS product and the estimated timeframe to see a potential meaningful financial return.The impact of these changes will be a reduction in headcount by c.30%  with cash burn reduced by c.20%  extending the Company's cash runway to late Q3 25  even after partial reinvestment of the savings into Phase Ib/IIa enabling studies for lead asset BEN-8744  following positive results from the Phase Ia trial.Since September 2023  the Company has made significant operational progress on multiple fronts  including signing the collaboration with Merck KGaA with a potential $594m in revenue generation  and announcing positive top line Phase Ia data on its lead asset BEN-8744 for the treatment of ulcerative colitis (UC)  as well as making significant changes to strengthen its Executive Leadership Team.The Company had communicated in March 2024 that a current market assessment was underway of its Knowledge Exploration Tools that would determine if  or how  this opportunity complemented its wider commercial strategy. Following completion of this assessment  which took into account the level of further investment needed to successfully commercialise these tools as well as the timeframe within which a meaningful financial return could be expected  the Company has concluded that resources allocated to the development of these tools would be better utilised focusing on the Company's two other revenue pillars  following on from recent successes in its AI driven drug discovery collaboration and proprietary pipeline pillars.here or remove ads . 3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com. See disclosureorAs part of this evaluation of business priorities the overall headcount of the Company has been reviewed and following the decisions announced today  it is proposed that headcount will be reduced by around 30% and headcount is expected to end the year at c.180. Importantly  key skills  experience and capabilities have been retained and these reductions maintain the Company's ability to execute on existing  or sign new  collaborations and continue to develop its core pipeline programmes. Additionally  the Company will close its US office. It is imperative for the operational effectiveness of the Company to have strong integration between its technology and scientific teams  and management believes this can be best achieved over its two largest sites in London and Cambridge  UK.While investment will continue to be made into the Company's pipeline programmes and development of the BenevolentAI Platform™  the amended business priorities outlined above will result in a reduced cash burn of c.20% which will extend the Company's cash runway to late Q3 2025. The Company will continue to explore all opportunities to fund the cash runway gap to year end 2025  at which time further larger milestones are expected to be received from existing partner programmes. These opportunities include potentially signing new drug discovery collaborations and out-licensing of the Company's proprietary pipeline assets  where ongoing discussions with third parties are making good progress. The Company remains committed to its previous guidance of signing at least one new collaboration and out-licensing at least one of its pipeline assets during 2024.

As the MMSD’s long standing operating partner  Veolia is designating Milwaukee as its first Ecofactory in America and will use its successes to inspire similar transformation in other cities across the country.Karine Rougé  CEO of Veolia North America’s Municipal Water division  said  ""Veolia is thrilled to partner with MMSD to launch the Ecofactory initiative in Milwaukee  a city that has long exemplified how to treat the environment responsibly and find creative ways to turn waste into resources. This collaboration represents a significant step forward in our shared commitment to sustainability and community engagement. By combining our expertise and resources  we can continue to create a more resilient and resourceful water infrastructure for Milwaukee and its residents  helping them cut carbon emissions  find value in wastewater and build stronger communities.”“Forward-thinking actions are so important to meet the environmental and climate challenges we face ” Mayor Johnson said. “I am pleased Veolia is building on the work of MMSD as it advances the Ecofactory concept. And  I look forward to additional partnerships to advance our common goals.”Kevin Shafer  Executive Director of the MMSD  said  “I could not be more humbled or proud to gather on this Earth Day to honor decades of innovation and the forward thinking that’s created a highly successful agency to protect public health and our source of drinking water  Lake Michigan.”Ecofactory approach creates new environmental opportunitiesDesignating Milwaukee’s wastewater treatment system as an Ecofactory marks a significant achievement for the MMSD and a new approach in America for Veolia  which is working across the country to reimagine how wastewater treatment can benefit communities. As the top-ranked company for environmental services  Veolia intends to make the most of its global expertise to help America meet its need for sustainable growth. Last week  the group announced its ambition to double its size in the country by 2030.An Ecofactory maximizes the value of the materials produced at a wastewater treatment system  such as reclaimed water used for agriculture or irrigation; waste heat or biogas used for energy; biosolids used for fertilizer; and even energy produced from on-site solar panels. An Ecofactory also optimizes those processes to operate as efficiently as possible  reducing greenhouse gas emissions  energy use and waste. And an Ecofactory consciously incorporates environmental and community stewardship from the start: Protecting biodiversity  strengthening climate resilience and creating new opportunities for green jobs and economic sustainability.Veolia has pioneered the Ecofactory approach in other operating markets  working with existing systems to boost their benefits and transform their roles within communities. In Santiago  Chile  Veolia’s Ecofactory recovers 310 gigawatt-hours of energy from wastewater to eliminate waste  fossil energy and pollution from its treatment process. In Granada  Spain  all 4.8 billion gallons of wastewater treated at Veolia’s Ecofactory are reused for irrigation. With people across the planet demanding action to preserve the world’s resources and counter a changing climate  the Ecofactory framework is bringing practical solutions to the common challenges that communities face everywhere.Milwaukee leads in treating wastewater as a resourceThe MMSD has taken an innovative approach to wastewater treatment for nearly a century  adopting a then-novel European treatment process in 1925 that used microorganisms to feed on organic materials in wastewater and transformed them into Milorganite® fertilizer. Building on this impressive track record  Veolia and MMSD are exploring new opportunities to enhance Milwaukee's water infrastructure through the Ecofactory approach. Focusing on technical initiatives such as increased beneficial reuse  solar energy production and biogas generation  the Ecofactory partnership aims to maximize the regenerative and decarbonizing potential of wastewater treatment  such as expanding solar resources to help operate with 100 percent renewable energy by 2035.Veolia and MMSD support community infrastructureThe Ecofactory initiative goes beyond technical advancements to recognize how the MMSD and Veolia have engaged deeply with Milwaukee's communities  neighborhoods and needs. Together they have focused on recruiting local workers from underrepresented areas of Milwaukee and are increasing efforts to support workforce grant initiatives  offer formal apprenticeships and increase access to Veolia’s internal workforce development program.The environmental benefits of the partnership are also visible through initiatives that celebrate sustainability and biodiversity in the greater Milwaukee region  from its green infrastructure development to its aggressive goals to mitigate the effects of a changing climate. It includes the Lynyrd Skymmr boat that cruises Milwaukee’s waterways to skim floating debris from the surface and improve water quality in the rivers and harbor.The Ecofactory in Milwaukee is set to become a model for sustainable water management and community involvement. Through this partnership  the city of Milwaukee  Veolia and MMSD aim to inspire other cities and organizations to adopt similar approaches  driving positive change and contributing to a more sustainable future.ABOUT VEOLIA NORTH AMERICAA subsidiary of Veolia Group  Veolia North America (VNA) offers a full spectrum of water  waste and energy management services  including water and wastewater treatment  commercial and hazardous waste collection and disposal  energy consulting and resource recovery.

A large number of travellers are now using alternative means of transport to air travel. The Group has rolled out a major awareness campaign with the aim of cutting CO2 emissions  suggesting train travel  direct flights or use of the latest planes whenever possible.On an historical basis (excluding acquisitions made in 2022)  sales were 16.5% higher than in 2019  which remains the benchmark. Tailor-made travel saw growth of 19.3%  while adventure travel was up 10.8%. In addition  foreign customers now account for 35% of total sales.Against the backdrop of a sharp upturn in activity  the Voyageurs du Monde group (the ""Group"") achieved extremely strong growth in 2023. Sales totalled €693.6 million  up 39.5% compared with €497.3 in 2022  as a result of the low level of departures at the start of 2022 (effect of Covid in the first quarter of 2022)  the integration of acquisitions made in June 2022 and very high demand for travel in 2023. However  the economic and geopolitical climate - with the war in Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East - remains uncertain.EBITDA or earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortisation. (**) EBIT or earnings before interest and taxes.EBITDA totalled €64.7 million in 2023  up 25.7% relative to 2022 (up 92.6% relative to 2019). Net income attributable to owners of the parent was €44.1 million  up 47.6% relative to 2022 (up 117.8% relative to 2019).These results attest to tight control of costs and the Group's ability to maintain its gross margin. During this periodof inflation  this was achieved thanks to the high level of added value and the many services offered to customers of all the Group's companies  with its well-known brands benefiting from a solid reputation and excellent image.CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITYFollowing two years impacted by the public health crisis  in 2023 the Group managed to pass on more of its earnings to employees than in 2019. A total of 21% of wealth created by the Group  or €18 million  was paid out to employees in the form of profit sharing  incentive schemes and bonuses.As regards the environment  the Group continued with the efforts initiated more than 10 years ago focusing on two main priorities: using all possible ways of reducing the carbon impact of its operations  and offsetting any residual emissions through reforestation projects. The additional and long-term features of these projects have been certified by international organisations and enable the Group to offset all carbon emissions associated with travel and most of its operations.OUTLOOKAs at 22 April 2024  2024 booked departures (change expressed relative to 2023 booked departures as of the same date) were up 8.2%. At the same date in 2023  the booked departures represented 72% of the total 2023 departures. Growth has waned since the start of the year as a result of a particularly strong performance in 2023  creating a significant base effect for 2024.In France  the Group will continue to improve its service offerings across all its brands. All adventure travel brands will continue to incorporate cycling holidays as an additional business following the acquisition of Eurofun Group.Outside France  the Group is still looking into opportunities for acquisitions in its historical business lines.The Board of Directors approved the 2023 financial statements at 3:45 p.m. on 23 April 2024.Reminder:The Group is market leader in France in tailor-made travel (56% of 2023 sales)  with the Voyageurs du Monde  Comptoir des Voyages  Bynativ and Original Travel brands  and in adventure travel (28% of 2023 sales)  with the Terres d'Aventure  Allibert Trekking  Nomade Aventure and KE Adventure Travel brands  as well as in cycling holidays (16% of 2023 sales) with the main brands EuroFun Touristik  Loire Valley Travel  Radweg Raisen  SE Tours and Ruckenwind Reisen.The shares (ALVDM FR0004045847) are admitted to trading on the Euronext Growth market and eligible for PEA PME savings plans.Contacts:Voyageurs du Monde Lionel Habasque  Deputy CEO  T: 01 53 73 77 09Email:lhabasque@terdav.comAlain Capestan  Deputy CEO  T: 01 42 86 16 57Email:acapestan@voyageursdumonde.fr2",neutral,0.02,0.98,0.01,mixed,0.32,0.27,0.42,True,English,"['Press release', 'Y2023 results', 'Voyageurs', 'Monde', 'PEA PME savings plans', 'new cycling holidays business', 'KE Adventure Travel brands', 'Voyageurs du Monde group', 'major awareness campaign', 'CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY', 'public health crisis', 'historical business lines', 'Loire Valley Travel', 'two main priorities', 'significant base effect', 'Original Travel brands', 'Euronext Growth market', 'main brands', 'historical basis', 'two years', 'additional business', 'market leader', 'air travel', 'train travel', 'Tailor-made travel', 'large number', 'alternative means', 'CO2 emissions', 'direct flights', 'latest planes', 'sharp upturn', 'low level', 'first quarter', 'high demand', 'geopolitical climate', 'Middle East', 'Net income', 'tight control', 'gross margin', 'high level', 'added value', 'many services', 'solid reputation', 'excellent image', 'profit sharing', 'incentive schemes', 'possible ways', 'carbon impact', 'residual emissions', 'long-term features', 'international organisations', 'carbon emissions', 'same date', 'strong performance', 'service offerings', 'The Board', '2023 financial statements', 'Comptoir des', 'Allibert Trekking', 'EuroFun Touristik', 'Radweg Raisen', 'SE Tours', 'Ruckenwind Reisen', 'Lionel Habasque', 'Deputy CEO', 'Alain Capestan', 'strong growth', 'reforestation projects', 'Nomade Aventure', 'The Group', 'Eurofun Group', 'foreign customers', 'total sales', 'total 2023 departures', '2023 sales', 'travellers', 'transport', 'aim', 'use', 'acquisitions', 'benchmark', 'backdrop', 'activity', 'result', 'start', 'Covid', 'integration', 'June', 'economic', 'Ukraine', 'conflict', 'EBITDA', 'earnings', 'interest', 'taxes', 'depreciation', 'amortisation', 'owners', 'parent', 'costs', 'ability', 'period', 'inflation', 'companies', 'known', 'employees', 'wealth', 'environment', 'efforts', 'operations', 'OUTLOOK', '22 April', 'change', 'France', 'opportunities', 'Directors', '23 April', 'Reminder', 'Voyages', 'Bynativ', 'Terres', 'shares', 'ALVDM', 'Contacts', 'Email', 'lhabasque', 'terdav', 'acapestan', 'voyageursdumonde', '2022', '2024', '3:45', '01']",2024-04-23,2024-04-24,marketscreener.com

Paris 315 459 016Press release Paris  23 April 2024Voyageurs du Monde announces plans for treasury share buyback offerProposed €130 million public share buyback offer (OPRA) for 20% of the company’s share capitalPrice of €150 per share  representing a premium of 16.3% to the closing share price on 22 April 2024About the proposed OPRAOn 23 April 2024  the Board of Directors of Voyageurs du Monde (“Voyageurs du Monde” or the “Company”) gave its approval in principle to a proposed public share buyback offer (offre publique de rachat d’actions or “OPRA”)  proposing to shareholders the buyback of a maximum of 866 666 of the Company’s shares at a price of €150 per share  which will then be cancelled as part of a capital reduction not due to losses. These 866 666 shares make up around 20% of Voyageurs du Monde’s share capital.The price of €150 per share represents a premium of 16.3% to the closing share price on 22 April 2024 (last day of trading before the announcement of the terms of the proposed OPRA).Background to the OPRALike all companies in the tourism industry  Voyageurs du Monde was affected by the Covid-19 crisis and in 2021 took the precautionary measure of strengthening its cash position by issuing €130 million of convertible bonds in two tranches.In view of the speed with which the Company has returned to or even exceeded the business levels achieved in 2019  the size of this issue proved to be excessive.In the light of this situation  the Company plans to submit to the Autorité des Marchés Financiers (the “AMF”) a €130 million treasury share buyback offer to be financed entirely by means of available cash. Following the share buyback  Voyageurs du Monde will still have the necessary resources to finance its operations and growth  with its equity remaining positive.Advantages of the OPRAThe aim of the planned OPRA is to reduce the Company's surplus cash  pay some of the value created over the last two years back to shareholders and offer a significant liquidity window for shareholders wanting to monetise all or part of their holding in the Company’s share capital in a situation of low share liquidity.Intentions of the majority shareholder and management teamAvantage SA  which owns 69% of the Company’s share capital and 80% of voting rights[1]  has informed the Company of its intention to tender some of its shares to the OPRA in the amount of €27.8 million.Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jean-François Rial and Deputy Chief Executive Officers Alain Capestan and Lionel Habasque have also informed the Company of their intention to tender some of their shares to the OPRA.Proposed timetableAt its meeting of 8 April 2024  in accordance with Article 261-1 I  3° of the AMF’s general regulations  the Company’s Board of Directors appointed Crowe HAF  represented by Olivier Grivillers (16 rue Camille Pelletan  92300 Levallois-Perret  + 33 (0)1 41 05 98 48 - olivier.grivillers@crowe-haf.fr) as independent appraiser to prepare a report on the financial terms of the proposed OPRA. The Board of Directors has decided to put together an “Offer Committee” to oversee the independent appraiser’s work and draft a reasoned opinion for the Board of Directors. Alain Capestan (director and Deputy Chief Executive Officer of the Company)  Emeline Bordier (permanent representative of Avantage SA) and Caroline Giral-Deppen (permanent representative of Crédit Mutuel Equity SCR) have been appointed as members of the Offer Committee due to their legal and financial expertise.In accordance with Articles 261-1 and 261-1-1 of its general regulations  the AMF has not opposed the appointment of Crowe HAF as independent appraiser.At its meeting of 23 April 2024  the Board of Directors approved the 2023 financial statements and decided to submit a resolution to the general shareholders’ meeting of 3 June 2024 authorising a reduction in the Company’s share capital and the buyback of treasury shares  which will then be cancelled as part of the OPRA.The proposed OPRA as described above is subject to certain conditions precedent  in particular the delivery of the independent appraiser’s report on the fairness of the price offered under the OPRA  obtaining authorisation from shareholders at the general meeting of 3 June 2024 to reduce the Company's share capital as part of the OPRA  and the delivery of a decision from the AMF confirming that the OPRA meets requirements.Voyageurs du Monde’s Board of Directors is due to meet again on 6 June 2024 to give a reasoned opinion on the proposed OPRA and authorise the filing of the proposed OPRA with the AMF  having familiarised itself in particular with (i) the assessment of the proposed OPRA by Portzamparc BNP Paribas as financial advisor and presenting bank and guarantor on behalf of the Company  (ii) the report by independent appraiser Crowe HAF  and (iii) the draft offer document (note d’information). The filing of the proposed OPRA with the AMF remains subject to the authorisation of Voyageurs du Monde’s Board of Directors. The proposed OPRA and the draft offer document will still need to be reviewed by the AMF.In line with the AMF’s recommended practices  the liquidity agreement with broker Gilbert Dupont is temporarily suspended as of today.The Voyageurs du Monde shares (ISIN: FR0004045847) and convertible bonds (ISIN: FR0014003UV2) will have their listing restored at start of trading on 24 April 2024.About Voyageurs du MondeThe tailor-made and adventure travel specialist.The shares are listed on Euronext Growth.ISIN code: FR0004045847 – Ticker: ALVDMLEI (Legal Entity Identifier): 9695005BNQGNY0ND5S19More information at www.voyageursdumonde.fr (investor relations)Contacts,neutral,0.03,0.96,0.01,mixed,0.12,0.31,0.57,True,English,"['OPRA Announcement', 'Voyageurs', 'Monde', 'Autorité des Marchés Financiers', 'Crédit Mutuel Equity SCR', '€130 million public share buyback offer', '€130 million treasury share buyback offer', 'offre publique de rachat', 'Deputy Chief Executive Officers', '317 790 euros Siège social', 'R.C.S.

(Euronext Growth Paris: ALTME)  a biotechnology company focused on developing novel therapies for treatment of cancer by targeting the tumor microenvironment (TME)  announces a positive update on survival at two years for newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients receiving NOX-A12  TME Pharma's CXCL12 inhibitor  with the VEGF inhibitor bevacizumab and radiotherapy.Two out of the six glioblastoma patients in this expansion arm of the GLORIA Phase 1/2 trial have survived for more than 24 months since the start of therapy. These two patients had tumors which  at one point during treatment  either disappeared completely or reached near-complete reduction (>99%) in size. The first patient to cross the two-year survival milestone had maintained a physical and cognitive condition within the norm  displaying only minimal disease-specific symptoms at this timepoint. This translates to a preserved quality of life  as evidenced by the patient’s continued ability to engage in hobbies  leisure activities  and social interaction. The second patient’s clinical status at the last assessment at 23 months was stable  although certain neurological functions had been partially affected. This patient’s course is also remarkable in that they received no therapy expected to prolong survival in the last 18 months since they decided to end treatment with the NOX-A12 combination following a near-complete reduction of tumor as assessed by MRI.In February  TME Pharma announced the final median overall survival (mOS) for this NOX-A12 cohort had reached an unprecedented 19.9 months. This survival rate compares very favorably to a matched standard of care reference cohort 1 which achieved an mOS of approximately 10 months  and exceeds what TME Pharma believes to be all relevant competitor therapy trials in newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients resistant to standard chemotherapy.2""This positive update from the GLORIA trial underlines the exceptional survival achieved by this cohort of patients with measurable tumors after surgery that are resistant to standard of care chemotherapy and gives more support for the potential of this NOX-A12 treatment regimen to prolong survival while preserving quality of life in patients suffering from this aggressive adult brain cancer "" said Aram Mangasarian  CEO of TME Pharma. ""This latest announcement adds to the significant clinical and regulatory progress we have made in recent months with our lead asset  putting us in an excellent position for our upcoming Phase 2 evaluation and our discussions with potential pharmaceutical and financial partners  as we endeavor to deliver NOX-A12 for the benefit of glioblastoma patients as quickly and efficiently as we can.""TME Pharma recently announced two key regulatory milestones with the clearance by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in March of the company's Investigational New Drug (IND) application for NOX-A12 in glioblastoma  allowing TME Pharma to proceed with the continued clinical development of NOX-A12 in a new Phase 2 study. This was followed by the FDA's award of Fast Track designation to NOX-A12 in glioblastoma in April. Fast Track designation aims to facilitate the development of therapies intended to treat serious conditions and address unmet medical needs  and could support an accelerated pathway to US regulatory approval. Preparatory steps for the NOX-A12 Phase 2 in glioblastoma are ongoing  and TME Pharma is aiming to initiate the new study as soon as the necessary resources from financial and industrial partners have been secured.About TME PharmaTME Pharma is a clinical-stage company focused on developing novel therapies for treatment of the most aggressive cancers. The company’s oncology-focused pipeline is designed to act on the tumor microenvironment (TME) and the cancer immunity cycle by breaking tumor protection barriers against the immune system and blocking tumor repair. By neutralizing chemokines in the TME  TME Pharma’s approach works in combination with other forms of treatment to weaken tumor defenses and enable greater therapeutic impact. In the GLORIA clinical trial  TME Pharma is studying its lead drug candidate NOX-A12 in newly diagnosed brain cancer patients who will not benefit clinically from standard chemotherapy. TME Pharma has delivered top-line data from the NOX-A12 three dose-escalation cohorts combined with radiotherapy of the GLORIA clinical trial  observing consistent tumor reductions and objective tumor responses. Additionally  GLORIA expansion arms evaluate safety and efficacy of NOX-A12 in other combinations where the interim results from the triple combination of NOX-A12  radiotherapy and bevacizumab suggest even deeper and more durable responses  and improved survival. NOX-A12 in combination with radiotherapy has received orphan drug designation for glioblastoma in the United States and glioma in Europe. TME Pharma was also awarded fast track designation by the FDA for NOX-A12 in combination with radiotherapy and bevacizumab for use in the treatment of the aggressive adult brain cancer  glioblastoma. TME Pharma has delivered final top-line data with encouraging overall survival and safety profile from its NOX-A12 combination trial with Keytruda® in metastatic colorectal and pancreatic cancer patients  which was published in the Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer in October 2021. The company has entered in its second collaboration with MSD/Merck for its Phase 2 study  OPTIMUS  to further evaluate safety and efficacy of NOX-A12 in combination with Merck’s Keytruda® and two different chemotherapy regimens as second-line therapy in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. The design of the trial has been approved in France  Spain and the United States. The company’s second clinical-stage drug candidate  NOX-E36  is designed to target the innate immune system.

The €4.7 M  3-year funding package is attributed by the French government and operated by Bpifrance and breaks down into grants and repayable advances. With this funding Theranexus will handle development (up to entry into clinical development) of an antisense oligonucleotide  an innovative drug candidate targeting TFEB[1]  the protein identified as the autophagy[2] regulator. The project draws on Theranexus' capabilities in the areas of molecular biology  neuroscience and drug development and ARNA and Diverchim's expertise in RNA chemistry and industrial active ingredient synthesis  respectively.“We sincerely thank the French governement for it financial support via France 2030 for the PickASO project. In line with our major strategic shift to rare neurological diseases initiated two years ago  via this collaboration with two leading players  Theranexus will be the first company to develop and bring to clinical trials an antisense oligonucleotide targeting a central autophagy pathway – the TFEB pathway – for patients with rare neurological diseases”  explained Theranexus Chairman and CEO  Mathieu Charvériat.“The PickASO project is an opportunity for Inserm (ARNA unit) to showcase its expertise in the area of oligonucleotides for therapeutic applications and give international visibility to its Optoligo platform. Moreover  this project will allow Inserm to validate and illustrate the value of its innovations in the fields of bioconjugation and modification of nucleic acids  notably in the development of therapies targeting rare neurological diseases. In terms of commercialization  the transfer of patents developed at Inserm to French industries and biotech firms will foster the development of new technologies essential for the drug candidates of tomorrow”  said Philippe Barthélémy  Director of the Inserm ARNA unit.“At Diverchim  we are very excited to collaborate on the PickASO project with such prestigious players as Theranexus and Inserm. Diverchim will be the first French company to offer ASO production capability that meets Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) requirements to manufacture clinical and commercial batches. We see this collaboration as a unique opportunity to apply our expertise to a novel therapy. The combination of our expertise in the chemistry of active pharmaceutical ingredients and the cutting-edge capabilities of our partners promises significant advances in biotherapies. We are looking forward to tackling this challenge together and to helping provide innovative solutions to patients in need”  continued Diverchim CEO  François Macarez.“The PickASO project embodies the collective commitment to offer new hope to patients with lysosomal diseases and boost the excellence of research and innovation in innovative therapies in France. Over and above this development  the PickASO project aims to structure a production sector for antisense oligonucleotides as there is currently none available in France for this very promising molecule that has great potential for the booming international market. This project is completely in the spirit of what the State is pursuing with France 2030  and in particular the health aspect: supporting and supporting health innovation to strengthen our sectors and our production capacities  and thus regain our sovereignty in health » specifies Bruno Bonnell  general secretary for investment in charge of France 2030.TFEB  an autophagy regulatorAutophagy is a cellular process involving small intracellular vesicles known as lysosomes used by cells to recycle part of their own material and destroy certain residues which accumulate and may become toxic for them. This process  which earned the Japanese scientist Yoshinori Ohsumi the Nobel Prize in 2016  is essential for cell and particularly neuron function  and is disrupted in a group of rare diseases called lysosomal diseases. Niemann-Pick type C  Sanfilippo and Batten diseases are examples of lysosomal diseases. But beyond these rare diseases  autophagy generally decreases with age and an autophagy deficiency is now identified as a determinant of diseases such as Parkinson's  amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The protein TFEB is the recognized molecular switch for autophagy[3]; its activation has been reported as an effective therapeutic remedy for numerous diseases  as shown in various in vitro or in vivo models.Overview of the PickASO projectFirstly  Theranexus had already identified an ASO promoting autophagy via direct action on TFEB. The first step in the PickASO project will involve assessing Inserm's lipid conjugation technology for improving the pharmacokinetic profile of ASOs and their ability to penetrate cells. Meanwhile Diverchim and Inserm will work together to implement semi-automated GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice)-compliant production of this ASO; and this will be a big first for France. Theranexus will also handle regulatory preclinical characterization. On project completion  the drug candidate's formulation will be approved  paving the way for clinical development.About TheranexusTheranexus is an innovative biopharmaceutical company that emerged from the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA). It specializes in the treatment of rare neurological diseases.

Positive results from the LUNA 3 phase 3 study demonstrated that rilzabrutinib 400 mg twice daily orally achieved the primary endpoint of durable platelet response in adult patients with persistent or chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). The safety profile of rilzabrutinib was consistent with that reported in previous studies.LUNA 3 study met its primary endpoint demonstrating a significantly higher proportion of patients receiving rilzabrutinib achieved the primary endpoint of durable platelet response versus placebo. This clinically and statistically significant result was achieved in a population of patients with primary ITP that had been refractory to prior therapy. Overall  study participants had a median of four prior ITP therapies and a median baseline platelet count of 15 000/μL (normal platelet count levels typically range from 150 000-450 000/μL). Positive results on key secondary endpoints also underscore the potential for rilzabrutinib to deliver clinically meaningful benefits for patients living with persistent and chronic ITP.Rilzabrutinib was granted Fast Track Designation by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of ITP in November 2020 and was previously granted Orphan Drug Designation.Houman AshrafianExecutive Vice President  Head of Research and Development  Sanofi“The results of this study reinforce rilzabrutinib’s potential to be a first-in-class oral  reversible BTK inhibitor that can provide clinically meaningful improvements for people living with severe immune-mediated diseases like ITP. These pivotal results are a testament to our commitment and expertise in rare blood diseases and ability to build a portfolio of next-generation small-molecule inhibitors that are both more selective and optimized to deliver robust efficacy and safety outcomes as compared to existing therapies.”ITP is a serious  acquired autoimmune blood disorder characterized by autoantibody-mediated platelet destruction and impaired platelet production  leading to thrombocytopenia (low platelet counts of less than 100 000/μL) and an increased risk of life-threatening bleeding episodes (like intracranial hemorrhage). In addition  patients with ITP often experience significant quality-of-life impairments such as fatigue and cognitive dysfunction. With its dual mechanisms of action that reduce production of pathogenic autoantibodies and decrease macrophage mediated platelet destruction  rilzabrutinib could address the underlying mechanisms responsible for a wide range of ITP complications.About LUNA 3LUNA 3 (NCT04562766) is a randomized  multicenter  phase 3 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of rilzabrutinib vs placebo in adult and adolescent patients with persistent or chronic ITP. Patients received either oral rilzabrutinib 400 mg twice a day or placebo through a 12- to 24-week double-blind treatment period  followed by a 28-week open-label treatment  and then a 4-week safety follow-up or long-term extension period. The adolescent part of the study is ongoing and still recruiting.The primary endpoint is durable platelet response defined as the proportion of participants able to achieve platelet counts at or above 50 000/μL for for at least 8 out of the last 12 weeks of the 24-week blinded treatment period in the absence of rescue therapy. Secondary endpoints include the number of weeks with and time to platelet responses  rescue therapy use  and physical fatigue and bleeding score.Detailed results of the LUNA 3 phase 3 study will be presented at a medical congress later this year.Rilzabrutinib is currently under clinical investigation  and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.About RilzabrutinibRilzabrutinib is an oral  reversible  covalent BTK inhibitor that has the potential to be a first- or best-in-class treatment of several immune-mediated diseases. BTK  expressed in B cells  mast cells and other cells from the innate immune system  plays a critical role in inflammatory pathways and multiple immune-mediated disease processes. With the application of Sanofi’s TAILORED COVALENCY® technology  rilzabrutinib can selectively inhibit the BTK target.Rilzabrutinib is being studied across a variety of immune-mediated diseases  including immune thrombocytopenia (regulatory submission in H2 2024)  asthma (phase 2)  chronic spontaneous urticaria (phase 3 start in 2024)  prurigo nodularis (phase 3 start in 2024)  IgG4-related disease (phase 2b results in H2 2024)  and warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia (phase 2b results in H2 2024).About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people’s lives.

The quarter’s activity was driven by momentum in film with the number of cinema admissions reaching 5 million over the period  against 1.2 million in the first quarter of 2023. Two films recorded more than one million admissions – Cocorico (1.9 million) and One Life (1.4 million) – whilst other films  such as Breaking Point (0.5 million) and Bolero (0.3 million)  also performed well.DiversificationDiversification revenue stood at €6.6 million for the three months to 31 March 2024  down €3.1 million  €2.4 million of which related to the deconsolidation of M6 Digital Services’ special interest media and services division  sold on 30 September 2023. The remainder of the change was primarily due to the slowdown in the property market which impacted Stéphane Plaza Immobilier’s business.Financial positionThe Group had shareholders’ equity of €1 347.4 million at 31 March 2024  compared with €1 305.1 million at 31 December 2023.The net cash position increased by €38.9 million  standing at €355.6 million8  compared with €316.7 million at 31 March 2023 (€320.8 million at 31 December 2023).DividendThe Combined General Meeting held today has approved the payment of a dividend of €1.25 per share in respect of the 2023 financial year  providing a yield of 9.7% calculated based on the 2023 closing price.

Adjusted for these factors  like-for-like revenue would have risen slightly by +2.9%  illustrating the strength of Séché’s main markets.Outside France  revenue came to €75.3 million vs. €64.1 million a year earlier  up 17.5% on a reported basis  but down 10.6% on a like-for-like basis. Excluding the impact of soil remediation spot business  revenue would have risen by -2.0% over the period  mainly due to a lower contribution from the ""Europe"" zone.After this Q1 characterized by the relative decline in its ""spot"" soil remediation activities  Séché is confident that its main markets in France and abroad will continue to perform well over the coming months.The Group confirms its organic growth target of +5% over 2024  to aim for contributed revenue of around €1 100 million (including the contribution of acquisitions made at the end of 2023  estimated at +€60 million).Comments on Q1 20024 revenueAt March 31  2024  Séché Environnement reported consolidated revenue of €262.9 million  compared with €263.9 million a year earlier.Reported revenue include non-contributed revenue  which break down as follows:In M€ - At March 31 2023 2024 Investments IFRIC 12 2 2 0 8 General Tax on Polluting Activities (TGAP) 14 2 14 9 Non-contributed revenue 16 4 15 7Contributed revenue came to €247.2 million  virtually unchanged from March 31  2023 (€247.2 million).Over the period  revenue recorded a scope effect of +€20.0 million  reflecting the robust contribution of the acquisitions made in 2023:Séché Assainissement Rhône-Isère -ARI- (consolidated at July 1st  2023): +€0.3 millionFuria (consolidated at October 1st  2023): +€16.8 millionEssac (consolidated at October 1st  2023): €1.1 millionRent-A-Drum (consolidated at January 1st  2024): €1.8 millionThe negative currency effect came to (€1.9) million vs. (€2.4) million a year earlier  mainly due to the South African Rand's parity against the Euro.On a like-for-like basis  revenue amounted to €227.2 million  down -7.4% at constant exchange rates compared with March 31  2023.Analysis by geographic scopeConsolidated data in € millionAt March 31 2023 2024 Gross change Organic change Subsidiaries in France 183 4 171 9 -6 3% -6 4% of which scope effect 0 3 International subsidiaries 64 1 75 3 +17 5% -10 6% of which scope effect 19 7 Contributed revenue 247 5 247 2 -0 1% -7 4%At March 31  2023  revenue at constant exchange rates would have been 245.6  with a negative currency effect of €1.9 million over the period.Business trends over the period reflect the solidity of the main markets  apart from soil remediation activities (decontamination and environmental emergencies) and energy revenue  which had made a strong contribution to performance in Q1 2023. The period also saw the one-off impact of early maintenance on a treatment facility in France.In France  revenue amounted to €171.9 million  down -6.3% on March 31  2023.The consolidation of Séché ARI had a perimeter effect of +€0.3 million.In the context of solid  long-term markets with industry and local authorities  this change mainly reflects the lower contribution of spot activities in environmental remediation and emergency services (-€8.7 million)  and to a lesser extent  of energy recovery activities  penalized  as expected  by the decline in energy revenue prices impacting revenue by €3.9 million.Growth in France was also hampered by maintenance work on the Salaise incinerator  which was anticipated as early as this first quarter (instead of third quarter last year)  with an impact of around -€3.8 million.Adjusted for these items  which penalize the comparison with Q1 2023  organic growth for the scope of consolidation would be +2.9%  driven by the Circular Economy (materials recovery) and Hazard Management businesses.Outside France  revenue reached €75.3 million  up +17.5% on a reported basis. The scope of consolidation effect was +€19.7 million  while exchange rates had a negative impact of -€1.9 million.On a like-for-like basis  revenue was down 10.6% compared with March 31  2023  significantly penalized by the one-off decline in soil remediation spot business in Peru and South Africa (down €6.2 million).Excluding these ""spot"" activities  revenue was down slightly (-2.0% at constant exchange rates)  with most subsidiaries reporting positive business trends  except for certain European subsidiaries.Analysis by activityConsolidated data in € millionAt March 31 2023 2024 Gross change Organic change Services 120 7 114 7 -5 0% -17 1% of which scope effect 16 2 Circular economy 77 6 84 5 +8 8% +4 1% of which scope effect 3 7 Hazard management 49 2 48 0 -2 5% -2 6% of which scope effect - 0 1 Contributed revenue 247 5 247 2 -0 1% -7 4%Services activities were down -5.0% compared with Q1 2023 on a reported basis. They include a scope effect linked to Séché ARI  Furia  Essac and Rent-A-Drum.On a like-for-like basis  their significant contraction (-17.1%) mainly reflects the lower contribution of ""spot"" environmental clean-up and emergency activities in France and abroad (down €14.9 million).Circular Economy activities recorded significant growth on a reported basis (+8.8%). The scope effect includes contributions from Furia and Rent-A-Drum.On a like-for-like basis  growth was up +4.1%  driven by materials recovery activities (notably chemical purification)  which offset the decline in ""Energy"" revenue in France (-€3.9 million vs. Q1 2023)  steam and electricity revenue prices for which were down sharply on the same period last year.Hazard Management activities were down slightly on a reported basis (-2.5%). The scope effect reflects the contribution of Rent-A-Drum.At constant scope and exchange rates  and against a backdrop of industrial and public authority markets that remain solid  particularly in France  the 2.6% decline in revenue essentially reflects the impact (€3.8 million) of a maintenance operation brought forward to the first quarter (instead of the third quarter in previous years) on the Salaise incinerator.Analysis by sectorConsolidated data in € millionAt March 31 2023 2024 Gross change Organic change Hazardous waste 164 7 166 5 +1 1% -6 9% of which scope effect 13 8 Non-hazardous waste 82 8 80 7 -2 6% -8 6% of which scope effect 6 2 Contributed revenue 247 5 247 2 -0 1% -7 4%In markets that have remained buoyant over the long term  the growth of our sectors  particularly the Hazardous Waste sector  was mainly penalized by the decline in construction site activities and energy revenue. As a result :The Hazardous Waste division generated revenue of €166.5 million  up +1.1% on Q1 2023 on a reported basis. It includes a scope effect linked to the contributions of Furia and Essac.On a like-for-like basis  the sector's revenue fell by 6.9%  reflecting the decline in the environmental emergency and remediation business (-14.9 M€)  the contraction in steam revenue prices (impacting revenue by -2.2 M€)  and the impact of early maintenance at Salaise (-3.8 M€).The Non-Hazardous Waste division reported revenue of €80.7 million  down 2.6% on the period on a reported basis. The scope effect reflects the contributions of Séché ARI  Furia and Rent-A-Drum.On a like-for-like basis  the sector's decline was -8.6%  as the impact of lower energy revenue (mainly electricity) in France (-€2.2 million) was not offset by the dynamic performance of other activities in other geographical areas.Growth prospects confirmedSéché Environnement is positioned in the sustainable growth markets of the circular economy  ecological transition  and environmental protection.On the strength of its offering  which meets the main challenges faced by its customers in terms of decarbonization and industrial and environmental risk management  the Group is confident in its ability to achieve better growth in the coming months in its main markets.Séché assumes a sharp fall in energy revenue prices in 2024 compared with 2023.After the strong base of Q1 2023  particularly in construction activities in France and internationally  and given the good availability of hazardous waste incineration facilities  particularly in the 2nd half-year compared with last year  growth should gradually accelerate over the course of the year  enabling the Group to achieve its organic growth target of 5% for the 2024 financial year  compared with adjusted revenue for 2023 (€985 million1 ).Considering the contribution of subsidiaries acquired at the end of 2023 (around €60 million for the year in respect of acquisitions made at the end of 2023)  revenue should reach a level close to €1 100 million in 2024.Conference callA conference call for financial analysts and investors will be held to comment on business for the Q1 2024  in French only  on April 23  2024 at 6:00 pm (CET).To attend the conference  dial +33 (0)1 70 99 53 53 / Code: 514 340 665 #A presentation is available from 5.45pm on the Séché website: www.groupe-seche.comA replay of the conference will be available from April 24  2024 on the Séché website at the same address.Upcoming eventsAnnual General Meeting April 26  2024Consolidated results to June 30  2024 September 4  2024 after market closeAbout Séché EnvironnementSéché Environnement is a leading player in waste management  including the most complex and hazardous waste  and in environmental services  particularly in the event of an environmental emergency.

It currently contains 15 products (including 4 added since January 2023) to meet the preferences (synthetic vs. biological) and indications (volume of products  strengthening action or bone filling) that orthopedic veterinarians are faced with.The Company generated €0.12 million of revenue  of which approximately 75% in Europe.A total of 741 units from the BIOCERA-VET® range were sold. While the BIOCERA-VET® BONE SURGERY line still accounts for 80% of total sales  a 50% increase compared to 2022  BIOCERA-VET® OSTEOSARCOMA displayed strong growth in 2023  with an increase of almost 70% compared with 2022  underlining the interest aroused by this unique solution for the management of osteosarcoma in dogs. In the United States  sales  which only came from direct sales  gained momentum in 2023  with 173 units sold  representing a 5.7 -fold increase.The Company also generated €0.96 million of “produced fixed asset” as a result of the activation of R&D expenses related to the BIOCERA-VET® and VISCO-VET® programs.The development of preclinical and clinical programs as well as the marketing plan of BIOCERA-VET® products are in accordance with the Company development plan and are reflected by the “Purchases and expenses"" globally aligned with last year expenses :COGS decreased by €0.14 million as compared to 2022 due to anticipated inventory stocking of products in 2022 to cover a large share of product sales in 2023;decreased by €0.14 million as compared to 2022 due to anticipated inventory stocking of products in 2022 to cover a large share of product sales in 2023; R&D expenses decreased by €0.22 million as compared to 2022  reaching €0.37 million. The decrease is driven by the shift in focus in 2023 to the commercialization of its recently developed product portfolio;decreased by €0.22 million as compared to 2022  reaching €0.37 million. The decrease is driven by the shift in focus in 2023 to the commercialization of its recently developed product portfolio; Corporate and listed company related expenses decreased by €0.07 million as compared to 2022  driven by a focus of the company on cost efficiency measures throughout 2023;decreased by €0.07 million as compared to 2022  driven by a focus of the company on cost efficiency measures throughout 2023; Marketing & Sales expenses decreased by €0.05 million as compared to 2022  with a limited impact of cost efficiency measures in this cost category  driven by the active focus of the Company on marketing and sales of its product portfolio;decreased by €0.05 million as compared to 2022  with a limited impact of cost efficiency measures in this cost category  driven by the active focus of the Company on marketing and sales of its product portfolio; G&A expenses decreased by €0.47 milllion as compared to 2022  a significant reduction of 35%  reflecting the Company’s focus on cost and organizational efficiency throughout 2023;decreased by €0.47 milllion as compared to 2022  a significant reduction of 35%  reflecting the Company’s focus on cost and organizational efficiency throughout 2023; Staff expenses decreased by €0.35 million as compared to 2022  an equally significant reduction of 32%  as a result of the Company’s ongoing organizational efficiency initiatives.Finally  the amortization of development expenses related to the BIOCERA-VET® and VISCO-VET® programs results in an operating loss of €2.2 million and a net loss of €1.6 million.The Company’s cash and cash equivalents at December 31  2023 amounted at €1.15 million  enabling it to fund operations to November 2024.Post-closing Operational HighlightsOn January 09  2024  the Company began distributing its BIOCERA-VET® product range in Italy  Europe's fourth largest pet market. This distribution agreement comes after market evaluation and the start of several clinical trials in Italy with key opinion leaders.On January 17  2024  the Company announced the official launch of its BIOCERA-VET® product range in Germany. With a total population of 27 million pets (including 10.3 million dogs and 16.7 million cats)  corresponding to 47% of owner households  Germany is the largest pet market in Europe.On February 20  2024  the Company announced the recruitment of Brakke Consulting to help it develop its growth strategy for the US market. Brakke is one of the leading consultancies specialising in the veterinary sector and has extensive experience in developing companies in this sector in the US market. Brakke's objective will be to help develop TheraVet's presence and recognition as a major player in the US orthopaedic market. He will also assist the Company in identifying potential M&A opportunities.On March 13  2024  the Company announced the launch of its equine business with the marketing of 2 new BIOCERA-VET® products for orthopaedic and dental surgery in horses. This launch marks the Company's entry into the high added-value equine market.On March 20  2024  the Company's Board of Directors decided to co-opt as a director the limited liability company FATAKI BV  whose permanent representative is Johan Dreesen  to replace Ms Julie Winand  who left her position within the Company and her directorship during the 2023 financial year. Confirmation of the appointment of FATAKI BV will be proposed at the next Ordinary General Meeting of the Company  scheduled for June 06  2024.On April 22 2024  after 18 months of unfruitful attempts due to factors beyond its control to start the distribution operations with its partner in the United States  the Company has decided to terminate the agreement and to focus on other distributors for which advanced discussions are underway.Full-Year Report 2023The 2023 Full-Year report for the year ended December 31  2023 will be published today  2024 and is available on the Company’s website  www.theravet-finances.com.The statutory auditor has issued an unmodified report dated April 22  2024 on the Company’s Full-Year accounts as of and for the year ended December 31  2023  and has confirmed that the accounting data reported in the accompanying press release is consistent  in all material respects  with the accounts from which it has been derived.Going concernThe financial statements were prepared on a going concern basis in accordance with the significant accounting policies set out below.During 2023  the Company's equity remained above the share capital.In addition  as the value of intangible assets and property  plant and equipment calculated on the basis of our discounted cash flow analysis was higher than their accounting value at December 31  2023  these assets were not subject to any additional exceptional depreciation.As the Company's balance sheet shows a loss carried forward of €-5 843 003 and a loss for more than two consecutive years  we are required to justify the application of the going concern accounting rules (article 3:6§6 of the Companies and Associations Code).The current accounting loss is due to the fixed costs of running the Company  and to the development costs of the VISCO-VET® and BIOCERA-VET® projects  which are not covered by a grant. Cash flow has been sufficient to cover these costs.Based on the current scope of its activities and best estimates of annual cash consumption  revenue and grants  as well as the absence of any significant impact of the political situation on its activities  the Company estimates that its cash and cash equivalents at December 31  2023 should be sufficient to finance its operations until November 2024. On the other hand  cash and cash equivalents may not be sufficient to meet the Company's working capital requirements for the twelve months following the date of release of the financial statements for fiscal year 2023. These circumstances indicate the existence of a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.The Board of Directors nevertheless considers it appropriate to prepare the Company's financial statements on a going concern basis  while implementing a plan to secure a new financial contribution to the Company.The Company is currently considering several options for raising additional funds  whether through equity financing  collaboration  or a strategic tie-up with another player in the animal healthcare market. Based on its operating budgets  the management believes that the Company will be able to meet its financial obligations for the 7 months following the date of these financial statements. The management therefore believes that the going concern assumption is justified.Financial calendar 2024Ordinary General Assembly: June 06  2024Half-year business update: July 11  2024Half-year financial results: September 12  2024About TheraVet SATheraVet is a veterinary biotechnology company specialising in osteoarticular treatments for companion animals.

[4] Starting from Q2 2023  the Online Capacity KPI is expressed in MWh and not in MW. [5] Q1 2024 as of 30 Mar Utilization Rate is computed weighting past periods and quarterly utilization rates. [6] This performance indicator includes AC PoC  mainly coming from the KLC and Ressolar acquired networks.Notes to the Q1 2024 Trading and Operational Update(1) Delta Net Working Capital indicator has been added in Q4 2023 and at each Quarter is calculated as (A) delta in short-term commercial liabilities over the three-month period less (B) delta in short-term commercial assets over the three-month period.(2) Net Cash indicator has been introduced in Q3 2023 and it represents the sum of the amount of (i) the bank accounts balances and readily available cash investments of the NHOA Group (Cash and Deposits)  (ii) the amount of cash deposited with banks as collateral (and thus excluded from (i)) for the guarantees they issue for NHOA Group’s projects (Cash Collateralized)  after deduction of (iii) amounts drawn under credit facilities and other financial indebtedness  plus accrued interest.(3) the Cash and Credit Lines available indicator has been amended in Q3 2023 and it represents the bank accounts balances and readily available cash investments of the NHOA Group (Cash and Deposits) plus amounts available for draw down as of the relevant reporting date under approved credit lines and banks guarantees that can be issued.(4) EU Grants and Financing to be received indicator has been introduced in Q3 2023 and it represents the total amount of grants and financing approved and available for drawdown on agreed future dates.(5) Outstanding Bonds and Guarantees indicator has been introduced in Q3 2023 and it represents the amount of bank guarantee securities (i.e. advance payment bonds  performance bonds  warranty bonds and other guarantees) issued as financial security for the fulfillment of the NHOA Group’s obligations in accordance with the terms of the agreed project and commercial contracts.(6) Backlog means the estimated revenues and other income attributable to (i) purchase orders received  contracts signed and projects awarded (representing 100% of Backlog as of the date hereof)  and (ii) Project Development contracts associated with a Power Purchase Agreement  where the agreed value is a price per kWh of electricity and an amount of MW to be installed (nil at the date hereof). When any contract or project has started its execution  the amount recognized as Backlog is computed as (A) the transaction price of the relevant purchase order  contract or project under (i) and (ii) above  less (B) the amount of revenues recognized  as of the relevant reporting date  in accordance with IFRS 15 (representing the amount of transaction price allocated to the performance obligations carried out at the reporting date).(7) 12-month order intake represents the cumulated value of new purchase orders received  contracts signed and projects awarded in the 12 months preceding the relevant reporting date.(8) Projects Under Construction is an indicator representing the capacity equivalent of Backlog  in terms of signed turnkey supply or EPC contracts and therefore excluding Project Development contracts associated with a Power Purchase Agreement  (please see Note (5) above).(9) Pipeline means the estimate  as of the release date  of the amount of potential projects  tenders and requests for proposal for which NHOA Energy has decided to participate or respond.(10) Sales include the data coming from the recent acquisition of the e-mobility business unit of Ressolar S.r.l. (“Ressolar”) and the recent acquisition of the majority stake in Kilometer Low Cost S.A. (“KLC”).(11) Utilization Rate indicator first published in Q2 2023  applies to Italy  France and Spain only and is calculated first at station level as the ratio of (a) kWh sold divided to (b) the maximum available power (i.e. the available grid connection) multiplied by 18 hours (being the assumed daily maximum charging hours) per number of days in the relevant period. The ratios are then aggregated  weighted by the stations' available power. Note that stations' utilization data is only included in the calculation after a phase-in period of six months and for sites with at least one DC fastcharging EVSE.(12) Occupancy Rate indicator applies to Portugal only where  due to the different local market regulations  as Charge Point Operator (CPO) Atlante is remunerated for the usage of its infrastructure ""by minute"". Occupancy rate is therefore calculated on a 24-hour basis  at a charger level considering 1 PoC per EVSE as the ratio of (a) minutes of charging sessions sold divided to (b) total number of minutes in the relevant period. The ratios are then aggregated  weighted by the stations' available power. Note that stations' occupancy data is only included in the calculation after a phase-in period of six months.(13) Sites Online and Under Construction  includes  as of the relevant reporting date  the number of sites already operational  already installed but waiting for grid connection  secured and under construction. Please note that this performance indicator includes sites with AC points of charge  mainly coming from the KLC and Ressolar acquired networks.(14) PoC Online and Under Construction  includes the points of charge already operational  as of the relevant reporting date  already installed but waiting for grid connection  secured and under construction. Please note that this performance indicator includes AC points of charge  mainly coming from the KLC and Ressolar acquired networks.(15) Of the PoC Online and Under Construction performance indicator the geographical and construction phase split are provided  including the AC points of charge  mainly coming from the KLC and Ressolar acquired networks.(16) Sites Under Assessment includes the total number of sites  as of the relevant reporting date  which are actively pursued after prospecting activity and following a first internal screening for high level feasibility. At this point  the full contractual documentation remains to be finalized and signed  all the required permits have not yet been awarded and construction has not started.(17) Sites Under Development  includes sites for which a more detailed feasibility activity commences  including detailed discussions with site owners and exchange of documentation. For the sites included in the “under development” performance indicator there would be a reasonable degree of confidence that they can be converted into stations within the next six months (subject to interconnection and timely delivery of hardware).* * *The Q1 2024 Trading and Operational Update will be illustrated in the investor conference call scheduled on 24 April at 9:00am CEST.

With a total population of 27 million pets (including 10.3 million dogs and 16.7 million cats)  corresponding to 47% of owner households  Germany is the largest pet market in Europe.On February 20  2024  the Company announced the recruitment of Brakke Consulting to help it develop its growth strategy for the US market.

See disclosureorOn April 22 2024  after 18 months of unfruitful attempts due to factors beyond its control to start the distribution operations with its partner in the United States  the Company has decided to terminate the agreement and to focus on other distributors for which advanced discussions are underway.Full-Year Report 2023The 2023 Full-Year report for the year ended December 31  2023 will be published today  2024 and is available on the Company's website  www.theravet-finances.com.The statutory auditor has issued an unmodified report dated April 22  2024 on the Company's Full-Year accounts as of and for the year ended December 31  2023  and has confirmed that the accounting data reported in the accompanying press release is consistent  in all material respects  with the accounts from which it has been derived.Going concernThe financial statements were prepared on a going concern basis in accordance with the significant accounting policies set out below.During 2023  the Company's equity remained above the share capital.In addition  as the value of intangible assets and property  plant and equipment calculated on the basis of our discounted cash flow analysis was higher than their accounting value at December 31  2023  these assets were not subject to any additional exceptional depreciation.As the Company's balance sheet shows a loss carried forward of €-5 843 003 and a loss for more than two consecutive years  we are required to justify the application of the going concern accounting rules (article 3:6 §6 of the Companies and Associations Code).The current accounting loss is due to the fixed costs of running the Company  and to the development costs of the VISCO-VET ® and BIOCERA-VET ® projects  which are not covered by a grant. Cash flow has been sufficient to cover these costs.here or remove ads . 3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com. See disclosureorBased on the current scope of its activities and best estimates of annual cash consumption  revenue and grants  as well as the absence of any significant impact of the political situation on its activities  the Company estimates that its cash and cash equivalents at December 31  2023 should be sufficient to finance its operations until November 2024. On the other hand  cash and cash equivalents may not be sufficient to meet the Company's working capital requirements for the twelve months following the date of release of the financial statements for fiscal year 2023. These circumstances indicate the existence of a material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.The Board of Directors nevertheless considers it appropriate to prepare the Company's financial statements on a going concern basis  while implementing a plan to secure a new financial contribution to the Company.The Company is currently considering several options for raising additional funds  whether through equity financing  collaboration  or a strategic tie-up with another player in the animal healthcare market. Based on its operating budgets  the management believes that the Company will be able to meet its financial obligations for the 7 months following the date of these financial statements. The management therefore believes that the going concern assumption is justified.Financial calendar 2024Ordinary General Assembly: June 06  2024Half-year business update: July 11  2024Half-year financial results: September 12  2024About TheraVet SATheraVet is a veterinary biotechnology company specialising in osteoarticular treatments for companion animals.

Challenges did persist in the Flame for Life segment due to Asian imports in the US market  but a gradual recovery is anticipated from Q2. BIC's strong commercial focus  compelling value proposition and brand loyalty enable us to win share in key markets.Our relentless focus on the execution of Horizon plan remains as strong as ever. BIC’s successful omni-channel commercial strategy is bearing fruit  with e-commerce sales growing double-digit in the first quarter. We boosted and supported our innovation pipeline with strong marketing activity delivering high levels of engagement with a new campaign led by DJ Khaled adding to international activity with Snoop Dogg  Martha Stewart  and Willie Nelson. We also continued to progress on our ESG goals by launching an educational campaign in South Africa during the Back-to-School season. We doubled down on our efforts on Revenue Growth Management  resulting in Net Sales per SKU growth of +13% and a -11% reduction of total SKU count versus last year. Finally  in March  we inaugurated our plant extension dedicated to Blade Excellence and Human Expression in Saltillo  Mexico  highlighting our efforts to maximize operational excellence globally.Our solid operating cash flow combined with our disciplined cash control contributed to generate a robust Free Cash Flow generation of €24 million during the first quarter 2024.For the balance of the year  as our Horizon initiatives continue to mature  we remain confident in delivering our objectives for 2024 and beyond.”2024 Outlook confirmed (based on current market assumptions3)Full Year 2024 Net Sales are expected to grow between +5% and +7% at constant currency4  driven by volumes  price  and mix.
