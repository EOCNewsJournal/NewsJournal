The leaders have asked us to give them a range of options "" Yellen said in an interview with Reuters  when asked if the leading option was pulling forward the interest on those assets to issue bonds or loans for Ukraine.""The Europeans have taken a very constructive step and that is most of Russian assets held in Belgium ... have now converted to cash and Euroclear earns interest on those assets. The European Union has agreed to segregate that interest and essentially move forward on a program in which it can be transferred to Ukraine. That is an approach that could be broadly supported by countries that are concerned about seizure of assets ... there are a range of options.""",neutral,0.01,0.96,0.03,positive,0.5,0.39,0.11,True,English,"['frozen Russian assets', 'Yellen', 'range', 'options', 'Reuters', 'U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen', 'The European Union', 'The Europeans', 'one possibility', 'constructive step', 'outright seizure', 'leading option', 'Russian assets', 'WASHINGTON', 'Reuters', 'Thursday', 'collateral', 'borrowing', 'market', 'Ukraine', 'leaders', 'range', 'options', 'interview', 'interest', 'bonds', 'loans', 'Belgium', 'cash', 'Euroclear', 'program', 'approach', 'countries']",2024-04-25,2024-04-26,investing.com

G7 officials say the assets could generate around $5 billion a year in interest.Yellen said Washington remained convinced that outright seizure of the Russian assets was justifiable under international law  but said other approaches would likely be more acceptable to some of its G7 partners.G7 members are still arguing about certain ""holdbacks"" that would whittle down those expected windfall profits to just $2.5 billion to $3.0 billion  one of the G7 officials said  pointing to Belgium's 25% tax rate  a ""convenience fee"" applied by depository Euroclear  and a proposed litigation reserve.Finance ministers from the G7 members will revisit the issue at a meeting in late May  with an eye to arriving at a consensus proposal to present to leaders for the June summit  the officials said.""We feel a sense of urgency to build international consensus "" the official said. ""Everyone acknowledges that we need to do more.""A second G7 official echoed that view  underscoring the need to ensure a longer-term stream of funding for Ukraine.A senior U.S. official said congressional approval of some $61 billion in long-delayed U.S. aid for Ukraine and a separate 50 billion euro package from the European Union would help Kyiv  but it still faced financing gaps in 2025 and 2026.CONSENSUSWashington is eager to build consensus around an idea that could help Ukraine now  the official said.Proceeding with a loan  instead of a bond  made sense since it wouldn't require formal issuance with a prospectus and would allow sovereign countries to act quickly  the U.S. official added. It would also allow G7 countries to provide additional support to Ukraine at relatively low cost.The G7 comprises the U.S.  Canada  Japan  Britain  France  Germany and Italy.Washington's shift towards focusing on interest from the assets comes after its push to confiscate the assets ran into massive resistance from France  Germany and the European Central Bank  who worry that the euro could be affected if other countries such as China start repatriating their reserves as a precaution against their possible confiscation in the future.""One big advantage of the loan idea from the European perspective is that it's entirely focused on the windfall proceeds "" the first G7 official said. ""You're just taking the proceeds that Europe has already determined are not owned by Russia  and you're bringing them forward. Not only is there no direct seizure  but there's also no threat of seizure.""Brad Setser  a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations  said Washington was clearly looking for a deal  and the proposal to bring forward the anticipated interest income could provide a good basis for an agreement in June.""It's a very reasonable approach and has limited legal risks "" he said  noting that G7 countries had pledged to keep the Russian assets frozen until Moscow pulled its forces out of Ukraine and paid for the damages caused by the invasion.""There's no evidence that Russia is leaving  so that means the income stream will be available for a long period of time.""

The report also showed a worrisome surge in inflation  with the personal (PCE) consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy rising at a 3.7% annual rate after a 2.0% pace in the fourth quarter of 2023.Yellen downplayed the inflation jump and said she did not see that as indicating that unemployment needed to increase or other areas of the economy needed to cool to return inflation to the Fed's 2% target.""The fundamentals here are in line with inflation continuing back down to normal levels "" Yellen said.Fighting inflation remained President Joe Biden's top priority  Yellen said  highlighting his administration's efforts to reduce healthcare  energy and housing costs. But Biden  a Democrat  has struggled to translate U.S. economic strength into voter support ahead of the November presidential election.Republican challenger Donald Trump led Biden by seven percentage points in a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll when voters were asked which candidate would be better for the economy.""What I focus on most is the strength of consumer spending and investment spending "" Yellen said. ""Those two elements of final demand came in in line with last year's growth rate ... so this is the underlying strength of the U.S. economy that showed continuing robust strength.""""The headline figure was off a little bit but for reasons that are peculiar and not really indicative of underlying strength "" she added.Indeed  a number of private economists said the GDP data likely overstated any weakness in an economy that had grown at above the rate most see as its potential for nearly two years  despite aggressive interest rate hikes over that span by the U.S. Federal Reserve aimed at quashing inflation.CHINA OVERCAPACITYYellen told Reuters no option was ""off the table' for dealing with one threat to the U.S. economy - overproduction in China  which was hurting manufacturers in numerous countries.She said that while Chinese policymakers have acknowledged they have a problem withexcess industrial capacityfor electric vehicles  solar panels and other clean energy goods  they need to address it  with the issue ""discussed intensively"" again last week.Asked about potential for new tariffs or other actions to protect U.S. producers from an expected flood of Chinese exports  Yellen said she would not eliminate any options as a possible response.She said Chinese overproduction threatens the viability of manufacturers in the U.S.  Europe  Japan  Mexico and India but the problem won't be resolved ""in a day or a week.""""So it's important that China recognize the concern and begin to act to address it "" Yellen said. ""But we don't want our industry wiped out in the meantime  so I wouldn't want to take anything off the table.""The Biden administration is completing a review of the ""Section 301"" unfair trade tariffs on Chinese imports imposed by former President Donald Trump in 2018  which U.S. officials have said could lead to higher tariffs on some products. Biden last week called for the review to triple the Section 301duties on Chinese steelto 25%.U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai also told senators that the U.S. needed to take ""early action  decisive action"" to protect the fledgling American EV sector from Chinese imports. U.S. tariffs on Chinese vehicle imports are now about 27.5%  and few Chinese EVs are sold in the U.S. at the moment.RUSSIAN ASSET PLANSYellen said that aproposal under discussionby finance ministers from the Group of Seven (G7) industrial democracies to harness earnings from frozen Russian central bank assets to aid Ukraine can be achieved without an outright confiscation of those assets  allaying the concerns of some countries.Yellen welcomed what she called a ""very constructive step"" taken by the European Union to segregate the proceeds from assets held by Brussels-based Euroclear and transfer them to Ukraine  noting future interest could also be pulled forward to back loans to Ukraine.""This is an approach that could be broadly supported by countries that are concerned about the seizure of assets  and some of the interest could be brought forward through  for example  a loan "" Yellen said.Yellen said the approach was among several options being discussed by G7 countries ahead of a leaders summit in June  adding  ""it certainly belongs on the list.""The U.S. approach  led by deputy national security adviser Daleep Singh  is gaining momentum among the G7 nations  two officials from the group told Reuters earlier on Thursday.Most of the Russian assets held by Euroclear have now been converted to cash  Yellen told Reuters.

Natural gas derivatives volumes also increased compared to the same quarter last year.""We are looking optimistically to hopefully another record year in 2024 "" said EEX Chief Executive Peter Reitz.Even though wholesale power prices have fallen since the energy crisis in 2022  trading volumes have risen.The stabilisation and decrease in power and gas prices has led to lower margin requirements which has freed up capital by participants for new trading activities  Reitz told journalists.Annual revenue from European power derivatives rose by more than 50% to 122.8 million euros while spot market revenue was up 17% at 86.7 million euros.Natural gas derivatives revenue in Europe increased 37% to 29.2 million euros.EEX said it has observed a continued shift from over-the-counter trading to cleared exchange markets due to the security and delivery of payments.Another factor behind trading volume growth last year was the entry of new trading participants. EEX admitted more than 80 new trading participants last year across all asset classes  it said.Separately  EEX's parent company Deutsche Boerse announced on Thursday a partnership with U.S.-based Nodal Exchange  which is already part of EEX Group.The partnership will provide Deutsche Boerse access to market data from Nodal Exchange so its clients will benefit from U.S. power and environmental market data.

During the hearing  the Court indicated that it may find elements of these claims valid in a later ruling.While Deutsche Bank continues to disagree stronglywith this assessment  the court's statements will impact Deutsche Bank's estimation of the probability of a future outflow  resulting in a legal provision in the second quarter of 2024. This provision will impact Deutsche Bank’s second quarter and full-year profitability and capital ratios.The estimate of the full amount of all claims  including cumulative interest  is approximately 1.3 billion euros.On a pro forma basisas of March 31  2024  the impact of the full provision on the bank’s Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio is estimated to be approximately 20 basis points  with a resulting pro-forma CET1 ratioof 13.25%. On the same basis  the Leverage Ratio would be 4.42% as of March 31  2024.Given the complexity of the legal issues and recency of the court's statements  Deutsche Bank's management will continue its analysis of the legal arguments and the potential financial statement impact. Generally  management does not expect a significant impact on the bank's strategic plans or financial targets.,neutral,0.02,0.82,0.17,negative,0.02,0.34,0.64,True,English,"['Postbank takeover litigation matter', 'Deutsche Bank AG', 'EQS-Adhoc', 'updates', 'resulting pro-forma CET1 ratioof', 'Postbank takeover litigation matter', 'potential financial statement impact', 'former Postbank shareholders', 'voluntary takeover offer', 'higher offer price', 'pro forma basisas', 'Common Equity Tier 1', 'EQS Group AG', 'Higher Regional Court', 'Deutsche Bank AG', 'Deutsche Bank updates', 'Legal Matter', 'CET1) ratio', 'financial targets', 'EQS News', 'significant impact', 'Key word', 'inside information', 'later ruling', 'future outflow', 'second quarter', 'full-year profitability', 'capital ratios', 'full amount', 'cumulative interest', '1.3 billion euros', '20 basis points', 'same basis', 'Leverage Ratio', 'legal issues', 'legal arguments', 'strategic plans', 'legal provision', 'full provision', 'CEST', 'Disclosure', 'Article', 'MAR', 'Regulation', 'service', 'issuer', 'content', 'announcement', 'hearing', 'April', 'Cologne', 'claims', 'connection', 'October', 'elements', 'assessment', 'statements', 'estimation', 'probability', 'estimate', 'complexity', 'recency', 'management', 'analysis']",2024-04-26,2024-04-26,stock-world.de

While volumes improved slightly compared to last quarter and the same period a year ago  volatility declined slightly in the period vs. last quarter despite a slight bounce back from the lows seen in December and remains significantly below the level seen in the same period a year ago.Fixed income trading volumes improved both on a quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year basis. However  volatility levels were down both on a quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year basis.Crypto saw a significant jump in trading volumes and volatility compared to last quarter and the same period a year ago given the U.S. spot Bitcoin ETF approval in January this year.Share Buyback€4.3m worth of shares were repurchased in Q124 as part of the €15m share buyback program announced in October 2022  with €7.6m of the program remaining. A portion of the shares to be repurchased under this program could be allocated to employee incentive plans as needed.OutlookFixed operating expenses guidance for the year remains unchanged and is expected to be in the same range as FY23 as headcount is expected to be flat to down for the year  offset by continued technology investments and inflationary pressures. The firm remains fully focused on operational and cost efficiencies across the business while implementing its growth and diversification strategies and bolstering trading capital.CEO StatementMike Kuehnel  CEO“Flow Traders achieved a strong result in Q1 on the back of elevated trading activity in the digital assets space in the quarter  despite the relatively subdued market trading environment in other asset classes. This quarter serves as further validation of our growth and diversification strategy  given our initial investment in the digital assets space more than seven years ago and our continued investment in the asset class when others quickly left during the downturn merely a year ago. Our steadfast belief in the asset class  and the opportunities it can bring to traditional financial markets is unwavering. We were well prepared for the highly anticipated regulatory approval in the U.S. for spot Bitcoin ETFs that came through at the beginning in the quarter as institutional interest in digital assets continues to grow around the world.Coming to the other areas of our trading capabilities  we have seen a slight increase in activity since the lows seen last December  although volatility is still down significantly when compared to a year ago. Regardless of the environment  we have been enhancing our trading capabilities and counterparty network in existing areas as well as exploring new potential opportunities. In terms of our strategic investments  we are well on track with our Euro-denominated stablecoin joint venture AllUnity with our partners DWS and Galaxy Digital  and in Q1 announced a strategic investment in ClearToken  further underpinning our strategy of investing in connectivity and financial market infrastructure.Looking at our operations  as we continue to focus on cost and operational efficiencies while balancing our key growth initiatives  fixed operating expenses in the quarter came in-line with our expectations. As we continue to execute our growth and diversification strategy and invest in trading capabilities in different asset classes and regions  we believe we can accelerate the growth of the firm with additional trading capital and will look to bolster our trading capital.In addition  we are thrilled to have Owain Lloyd join Flow Traders on 1 May as Chief Technology Officer. Owain brings with him over 20 years of senior leadership experience across traditional finance  market making  and digital assets trading technology and we look forward to his nomination as an Executive Director of the Board at our AGM on 13 June.”Preliminary Financial Calendar13 June 2024 AGM17 June 2024 FY23 final dividend proposed ex-dividend date18 June 2024 FY23 final dividend proposed record date20 June 2024 FY23 final dividend proposed payment date30 June 2024 Start of silent period ahead of H124 results25 July 2024 Release of H123 resultsAnalyst Conference Call and WebcastThe Q124 trading update analyst conference call will be held at 10:00 am CEST on Thursday 25 April 2024.

DBV is currently focused on investigating the use of its proprietary technology platform  Viaskin™  to address food allergies  which are caused by a hypersensitive immune reaction and characterized by a range of symptoms varying in severity from mild to life-threatening anaphylaxis. Millions of people live with food allergies  including young children. Through epicutaneous immunotherapy (EPIT™)  the Viaskin platform is designed to introduce microgram amounts of a biologically active compound to the immune system through intact skin. EPIT is a new class of non-invasive treatment that seeks to modify an individual’s underlying allergy by re-educating the immune system to become desensitized to allergen by leveraging the skin’s immune tolerizing properties.

CB 1 -SSi have been developed by Aelis Farma based on the discovery of a natural regulatory mechanism of CB 1 hyperactivity made by the team led by Dr. Pier Vincenzo Piazza  the Company’s CEO  when he was the director of the Neurocentre Magendie of the INSERM in Bordeaux. By mimicking this natural mechanism  CB 1 -SSi appear to selectively inhibit the disease-related activity of the CB 1 receptor without disrupting its normal physiological activity. CB 1 -SSi have consequently the potential to provide new safe treatments for several brain diseases.Aelis Farma is currently developing two first-in-class clinical-stage drug candidates: AEF0117 for the treatment of cannabis use disorder (CUD)  currently being tested in a phase 2b study in the United States; and AEF0217 for cognitive disorders  including those of Down Syndrome (Trisomy 21)  currently in a phase 1/2 study in Spain in people with Down syndrome. The Company also has a portfolio of new innovative CB 1 -SSi for the treatment of other disorders associated with a dysregulation of the activity of the CB 1 receptor.Aelis Farma draws on the talents of more than 25 highly qualified employees.For more information  visit www.aelisfarma.com and follow us on LinkedIn and Twitter.ISIN: FR0014007ZB4Ticker: AELISB Compartment of Euronext ParisDisclaimerForward-looking statementsSome information contained in this press release are forward-looking statements  not historical data.

The Whiptail project is located in the Stabroek Block  a 26 800 km2 strategic basin located off Guyana’s continental shelf  where several important discoveries have been made since 2015.The Group will deliver over 180km of line pipe  including X80 grade (following the lots previously booked for the Uaru order). X80 is a differentiated solution developed and qualified by Vallourec’s R&D teams. The X80 grade combines high strength with resistance to service conditions  making it a valuable contributor to future deeper-water developments.Following the Yellowtail  Gas-to-Energy and Uaru orders  signed under the same LTA  the Whiptail order further strengthens Vallourec’s strategic supplier relationship with ExxonMobil Guyana. With the Whiptail order  Vallourec has now secured orders for approximately 700 km of line pipe for installation offshore Guyana since December 2021.Vallourec will serve ExxonMobil Guyana from its state-of-the-art Jeceaba (Minas Gerais) mill which combines large production capacities and premium capabilities.Philippe Guillemot  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Vallourec  commented: “This significant new contract represents the fourth under the 10-year frame agreement signed three years ago with ExxonMobil Guyana. This is also the second order to include our grade X80  demonstrating Vallourec’s ability to deliver solutions to the industry that are both technological and efficiency enablers. This is a new milestone in Vallourec's long history with ExxonMobil  and I would like to thank ExxonMobil once again for its confidence in Vallourec and our team for this great work”.About VallourecVallourec is a world leader in premium tubular solutions for the energy markets and for demanding industrial applications such as oil & gas wells in harsh environments  new generation power plants  challenging architectural projects  and high-performance mechanical equipment.

But the Marie Brizard brand enjoyed a bump in sales thanks to new product listings; On-Trade Sales rose 7.9% in Q1 2024  up from an already strong basis for comparison in Q1 2023.International sales fell 12.3% during the quarter versus Q1 2023  with contrasting operating performances by region:a decline in sales at European subsidiaries  particularly Lithuania  Bulgaria and Spain  as a number of customers ran down their inventories and the Industrial Services segment contracted  including the bulk market. William Peel  however  posted a strong quarter with growing revenues; first quarter of recovery in the United States  with Sobieski doing better following a dismal Q1 2023  and growing revenues in Brazil as 2023 price rises fed through; declining export markets  particularly in Asia Pacific  with significant decreases in Australia  Korea and Europe  where strong growth in Benelux  Italy and Germany were unable to offset declining sales in Poland.NB: All figures for changes in revenues reported herein are at constant exchange rates and consolidation scope  unless otherwise stated.Marie Brizard Wine & Spirits (Euronext: MBWS) today announces its unaudited revenues for the first quarter of 2024  covering the period from 1 January to 31 March 2024.Q1 2024 revenues€m Q12023 LFL change Currency impact Q12024 LFL change (excl. currency impact) Reported growth (incl. currency impact) France 19.4 0.1 - 19.5 0.5% 0.5% International 27.1 -3.3 0.0 23.8 -12.3% -12.2% TOTAL MBWS GROUP 46.5 -3.2 0.0 43.3 -6.9% -6.9%France clusterFrance cluster revenues edged up by 0.5% in Q1 2024 versus Q1 2023  to €19.5m. Volume sales of spirits in the Off-Trade continued to decline  however this was offset by market share gains for William Peel  San José and Sobieski  by price rises introduced on 1 March 2023 that fed through  and by strong performances in the On-Trade which were up 7.9% as the portfolio of premium Agency brands arrived on the shelves.Overall  the market for spirits sold through major retailers shrank by 5.9%1  with a particularly sharp decline in the 12-year blended scotch whisky market  where volumes were down 6.5%1. This weighed on revenues for international strategic brands over the quarter  though Marie Brizard bucked the trend  growing strongly as new listings came onstream in 2024.International clusterThe International cluster posted Q1 2024 revenues of €23.8m  down 12.3% versus Q1 2023 at constant exchange rates.Spain saw a 12.8% drop in sales in Q1 2024 after a production line was forced to shut down for retooling during the month of March  some products were delisted in 2023 and a number of customers ran down inventories.In the export markets of Western Europe  the Middle East and Africa  Q1 revenues fell by 11.2%. This reflected poor sales in a number of markets  notably Africa  the Middle East and the French overseas departments and territories  which were only partly mitigated by strong performances in Benelux  Germany and Italy  led by rising sales of the William Peel  Sobieski and Marie Brizard brands.Revenues in Lithuania fell by 16.5%  mainly due to a drop-off in Industrial Services  which faced falling market prices for bulk sales and a reduction in the bottling of private label products. Exports also contributed to the decline  as bottlenecks at the Ukrainian border caused logistical problems. International Strategic and Flagship Regional Brands like Sobieski and Bajoru held up well in the local market  and export sales of William Peel continue to progress apace.In Bulgaria  Q1 sales were down 20.5%  resulting from two contrasting factors:a decline in Industrial Services after a strong quarter in Q4 2023 as customers ran down their existing inventories;an expanding domestic market driven by the International Strategic Brands William Peel and Sobieski and Flagship Regional brands  particularly wine  whose sales rose during the quarter.Revenues in Scandinavia fell 3.7% in Q1 2024  although there was a mild pick-up late in the quarter  with declines for Agency Brands and for the International Strategic Brands  except Gautier.In Eastern Europe export markets  Q1 sales fell sharply after our Polish distributor decided to massively reduce inventories.In the United States  Q1 2024 revenues rose 51.0%  up from a weak basis for comparison in Q1 2023. Growth was led by Sobieski  whose inventory at our local distributor now seems to have stabilised.Export sales in the Americas recorded modest growth of 1.7%  with solid performances by international Strategic Brands  particularly in Canada  including Cognac Gautier.In Brazil  Q1 2024 revenues were up 5.9% on Q1 2023  primarily thanks to strong performances by Flagship Regional and Agency Brands. Revenues were also helped by the continuing impact of price hikes in 2023.Finally  Asia Pacific saw a sharp decline in sales of 40.5% in Q1 2024 versus the previous year  particularly in Korea where the distributor cut down inventories over the quarter  and in Australia  where sales of Marie Brizard declined  though this was partly offset by a strong brand performance in Japan.OutlookFollowing a generally positive dynamic in the end of 2023  the downward trend in the wines and spirits markets hit sales in the first quarter of 2024  affecting the Group's main operating regions.As indicated in the last Press Release of 17 April and looking ahead to full-year 2024  the Group sees a climate of price pressure from retailers  coupled with declining consumption. It anticipates a gradual normalisation of the market in terms of inflation over the first half of 2024.Given the current slowdown in the wines and spirits sector  amid an increasingly tense and fast-changing international and geopolitical environment  the Group is standing by its policy of wise operational management.The Group is determined to continue rolling out its development strategies  namely organic growth through the international expansion of Strategic Brands  local development of Flagship Regional Brands  growth in the Agency Brands business and development of the Industrial Services offering  while at the same time seeking out complementary growth opportunities. Its key strength remains its capacity to offer consumers quality products at affordable prices  despite declining purchasing power.Financial calendarGeneral Meeting: 27 June 2024H1 2024 revenues: 25 July 2024Investor and shareholder relations contactMBWS GroupEmilie Drexlerrelations.actionnaires@mbws.comTel.: +33 1 43 91 62 21 Press contactImage SeptClaire Doligez - Laurent Poinsotcdoligez@image7.fr – lpoinsot@image7.frTel.: +33 1 53 70 74 70About Marie Brizard Wine & SpiritsMarie Brizard Wine & Spirits is a wine and spirits group based in Europe and the United States.

Revenue for the first quarter 2024Net revenue of the Group amounted to €668 million  down -4.3% compared to the first quarter of 2023  and organic growth was -2.7% (or -2.2% including sales price changes in the CIS region(1) ). Sales prices remained stable over the financial year  i.e.  -0.3% compared to the first quarter of 2023.The EMEA segment achieved a net revenue of €221 million  down -3.9% compared to the first quarter of 2023  including a favourable exchange effect of +0.5% and a scope effect of +1.9% (integration of activities in Ukraine previously included in CIS)  i.e.  organic growth of -6.3%. The macroeconomic environment  inflation and high interest rates continue to penalise demand in the eurozone regardless of product categories and distribution channels. Some sales prices were selectively adjusted downwards in the Residential segment  where the decline in volume and competition from Asian players are more pronounced.The North America segment generated a net revenue of €199 million  down -7.1% compared to the first quarter of 2023  reflecting like-for-like growth of -6.0% at constant scope and exchange rates as well as a negative currency effect linked to the depreciation of the dollar against the euro (-1.1%). The Residential market is still heavily penalised by inflation and rising bank loan rates  which have led to a very sharp reduction in new construction and renovation projects. The Commercial segments are less impacted and only show a slight decline. Tarkett continued to grow in the Workplace segment despite a challenging market environment. Sales prices remained stable in the first quarter.Net revenue in the CIS  APAC and Latin America segment amounted to €107 million  down -12.3% compared to the first quarter of 2023  with organic sales falling by -1.3% (excluding sales price effects in CIS countries)  a negative currency effect (-7.3%) mainly linked to the depreciation of the rouble and a scope effect of -3.7% (integration of activities in Ukraine in the EMEA segment). In Russia  which represents around 7% of the Group’s total sales  the market is stable in volume terms compared to 2023. Asia is buoyed by good momentum in Australia. In Latin America  demand remained low and lagged behind considerably compared to the previous year  especially in Brazil.Activity in the Sports segment continued to grow in the first quarter despite an already high baseline. Net sales amounted to €141 million  up +6.7%  including +7.9% organic growth compared to the first quarter of 2023  and a negative currency effect linked to the depreciation of the dollar against the euro (-1.2%). Demand remains strong for artificial turf and athletics tracks in North America  with a solid order book.2. OutlookAs expected  the beginning of 2024 was marked by a decline in activity in the flooring sector. High interest rates and persistent inflation have led to the cancellation or postponement of many new construction and renovation projects. The Group does not expect a rapid improvement in the environment  although situations may differ between regions and Residential or Commercial segments.As the European market is experiencing the most severe slowdown  the Group recently announced measures to reorganise and reduce costs in this area. It implements a more agile  customer-centric operating model and continues to optimise the industrial organisation to better respond to the challenging environment and generate profitable and sustainable growth.In North America  the Residential market remains depressed and leading indicators do not predict a rapid recovery. However  the Group’s exposure to this segment is limited (15% of sales)  and the Commercial segments are in better shape. The recovery measures taken by the Group in this area continue to pay off and should allow further market share gains and margin growth.The Sports segment has a solid order book in all its activities and is expected to continue to grow in 2024 at a less sustained pace than in the last two financial years (+33.4% organic growth in 2022 and +20.1% in 2023)In this context  the Group continues to adapt its production level and cost structure while investing in the launch of new products in particular ranges that include more recycled products  and the renewal of existing collections.Tarkett is continuing its operational and financial turnaround initiated in 2023. After the very strong cash generation in 2023  the Group continues to aim for positive cash generation and deleveraging through rigorous control of working capital requirements and costs  as well as control of investments which will be allocated as a priority to innovative  growth  productivity and decarbonization projects.1) Selling price adjustments in the CIS countries are historically intended to offset currency fluctuations and are therefore excluded from the “organic growth” indicator (see Appendix 1)This press release may contain forward-looking statements.

Since 1974  this energy industry’s leading supplier of fluid transfer systems has been providing marine loading arms for onshore and offshore use with different applications.On the occasion of its 50th anniversary  Loading Systems announces the launch of the eMAX series  an advanced suite of electric and automatic loading arm products. In addition  Loading Systems has signed a strategic partnership agreement with Cascade Drives AB  a developer and manufacturer of electric linear actuators  to develop a series of electric actuators to be embedded in the new eMAX loading arms technology.The eMAX series will leverage the partnership with Cascade Drives AB  by transitioning from hydraulic to electric actuators in loading arm solutions.The new eMAX series offers the following features:electric: Electric drives replace the conventional hydraulic system to operate the loading arms  offering new possibilities for automation and monitoring  as well as reducing maintenance needs and hydraulic oil leakage risks.Monitoring: By integrating a data acquisition and processing architecture which can gather data during the operations  maintenance scheduling can be optimized  shifting from preventive or corrective maintenance to predictive maintenance.Automatic: Automation minimizes human intervention usually needed to connect and disconnect the marine loading arm by integrating fully automated sequences  resulting in safer and faster operations with less intensive training requirements.X – Cross Applications: the eMAX series is suitable for any kind of application such as petrochemicals  LNG  ammonia or liquid CO 2 in various loading configurations.Eric Morilhat  Managing Director of Technip Energies Loading Systems  commented: “Innovation has always been part of Loading Systems DNA  and I would like to thank our teams for their continuous engagement as we celebrate today our 50th anniversary. Our new eMAX series sets a new standard for the loading arms industry by automating the process  incorporating monitoring instruments for easier maintenance  and using electric actuators ready for future enhancements.

The study was deployed in the United States  Europe (8 countries)  Israel and the United Kingdom.Yannick PLETAN  General Manager & Chief Medical Officer  comments: ""These results obtained with glenzocimab in combination with the reference stroke treatment are extremely disappointing and in contradiction with the results of the previous phase 1b/2a ACTIMIS study and pharmacological studies. The ACTISAVE study included 438 patients  of whom 421 were treated  including 211 in the glenzocimab arm. Treatment was systematically combined with thrombolysis  and for just over 30% of patients with mechanical thrombectomy. The study population proved to be significantly less severe than that of ACTIMIS  with a very high percentage of patients returning to near-normal life. This negative result for Acticor is also negative for the medical community awaiting new treatments. It contradicts the results of previous pharmacological studies and clinical data. Main quality aspects of the study were analysed and found to be compliant. ACTICOR is currently investigating any influencing factors that may have accounted for these results. We're also assessing the potential impact on the 2 other clinical studies currently underway: GREEN in stroke patients undergoing mechanical thrombectomy and LIBERATE in myocardial infarction (STEMI).

Founded in 2022  the start-up drew its inspiration from rammed earth  an ancient building method  to develop an industrial approach aimed at mainstreaming the use of compressed earth in construction. Terrio's compressed earth blocks provide thermal comfort and act as an effective sound insulator. In addition  they are made using local and recyclable materials  significantlyIcade  via its Urban Odyssey start-up studio  and Spurgin  the French leader in double walls  have made an operational and financial commitment to Terrio  a fast-growingstart-up specialised in compressed earth building materials.

For Icade  this collaboration is part of its new ReShapE strategic plan which aims to include more renewable bio-based and natural mineral materials in its new builds by 2030. For its part  Spurgin provides operational support and industrial feedback for low-carbonoff-site construction.This alliance marks a milestone in shaping the natural mineral materials sector for the construction industry by promoting the widespread use of compressed earth in new builds. It also illustrates the Urban Odyssey method for developing innovative entrepreneurial solutions in a small  pragmatic industrial ecosystem.Promising first stepsTo date  Terrio has been involved in a number of major projects  including the construction of France's highest compressed earth façade for a social landlord in Boulogne in 2023. In partnership with Icade  Terrio is also involved in projects such as the construction of a commercial building in Lyon and  more recently  the renovation of the Guillot-Bourdeix tower in Lyon.

In May 2023  Nature published on the progress of a participant from a 2021 clinical feasibility study in which the Company’s ARC-IM ® Therapy was paired with an implanted brain-computer interface (BCI) for the first time  resulting in that individual gaining augmented control over when and how he moved his paralyzed legs. In August 2023  the Company also completed the successful first-in-human use of an implanted BCI paired with the ARC-IM System to help a person with SCI recover thought-driven movement in his arms and hands. The Company calls this combined platform that enables thought-driven movement the “ARC-BCI™ System.”Therapy was paired with an implanted brain-computer interface (BCI) for the first time  resulting in that individual gaining augmented control over when and how he moved his paralyzed legs. In August 2023  the Company also completed the successful first-in-human use of an implanted BCI paired with the ARC-IM System to help a person with SCI recover thought-driven movement in his arms and hands. The Company calls this combined platform that enables thought-driven movement the “ARC-BCI™ System.” Also in May 2023  the Company completed the successful first-in-human use of the ARC-IM Lead  designed to deliver ARC Therapy to areas of the spinal cord responsible for a specific function  such as mobility or blood pressure regulation. The Company is developing a portfolio of ARC-IM Leads  each optimized for placement on a different area of the spinal cord.In September 2023  the Company expanded its HemON clinical feasibility study to explore use of the ARC-IM System to improve blood pressure regulation after SCI with the addition of Sint Maartenskliniek in the Netherlands. This additional research site prepares the Company for expected Q4 2024 initiation of a global pivotal trial called Empower BP to assess the safety and efficacy of ARC-IM Therapy to improve blood pressure regulation.In November 2023  the Company announced a publication in Nature Medicine highlighting the potential for ARC-IM Therapy to address gait challenges related to Parkinson’s disease. Also in November  ONWARD Medical research partner .NeuroRestore was awarded a $1 million grant from The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research (MJFF) to implant the Company’s ARC-IM System and investigate the impact of ARC-IM Therapy in six additional participants with Parkinson’s disease.In 2023  the Company was awarded five new Breakthrough Device Designations (BDDs) by the US Food & Drug Administration (FDA) for its ARC Therapy platforms  bringing the Company’s total number of BDDs to 9. A 10th BDD was added for ARC-BCI in February 2024.In March 2024  ONWARD was only the second BCI company admitted into the FDA’s new Total Product Lifecycle Advisory Program (TAP) for its brain-computer interface technology.In April 2024  the Company announced it had submitted a De Novo application to the US FDA to obtain regulatory clearance to begin marketing its non-invasive ARC-EX System in the United States. Clearance is expected Q4 2024.Intellectual Property:The Company was issued more than 50 new patents during 2023  bringing its total number of issued patents to more than 240  further strengthening its first-mover advantage.Commercial:In September  the Company announced a partnership with Lovell Government Services (Lovell)  a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB).

The two-year distribution agreement gives the Company contract access to the United States Veterans Health Administration  the world’s largest healthcare system providing SCI care  and the US Department of Defense Military Health System  the world’s largest military healthcare provider.Corporate:In Q1  the Company strengthened its leadership team  appointing Erika Ross Ellison as Vice President  Global Clinical  Regulatory  and Quality  and Sarah Moore as Vice President  Global Marketing.In Q2  Bryan  Garnier & Co reinitiated research coverage of ONWARD Medical following the appointment of a new equity research analyst. In 2024  KBC Securities and Stifel both initiated research coverage of the Company. Equity research analysts from 5 investment banks now cover ONWARD  each with a Buy rating and target price at a substantial premium to the current share price.In Q3  Robert Odell joined the Company as Vice President of Operations.

CARBIOS (Euronext Growth Paris: ALCRB)  a pioneer in the development and industrialization of biological technologies to reinvent the life cycle of plastic and textiles  today celebrated the groundbreaking ceremony for the world's first PET biorecycling plant in the presence of representatives of local authorities  partner brands and industrial partners who all make up CARBIOS’ ecosystem. Located in Longlaville  in the Grand-Est region of France  CARBIOS' first commercial plant will play a key role in the fight against plastic pollution  offering an industrial-scale solution for the enzymatic depolymerization of PET waste in order to accelerate a circular economy for plastic and textiles. The plant will have a processing capacity of 50kt/year of prepared waste when operating at full capacity. Work is progressing on schedule with significant quantities delivered to customers in 2026.PET  the second most widely used plastic in the world  is mainly manufactured from oil. Thanks to CARBIOS’ enzymatic biorecycling technology  PET will no longer be made from oil  but from its own waste. This technological breakthrough opens up new recycling streams for multilayered  coloured and opaque trays made from packaging waste and polyester textile waste  which until now have been little or not recycled at all  giving them value. In addition  this breakthrough positions France as a pioneer in green innovation  contributing to its reindustrialisation and leadership in the transition to a sustainable economy.In a LinkedIn post published on 24 April 2024  Emmanuel Macron  President of France  said: “A technological revolution is taking shape tomorrow with the groundbreaking ceremony of CARBIOS’ plant in Longlaville: the world's first biorecycling plant. French pride! Ecological transition and growth  made in France and innovation go hand in hand.”Christophe Béchu  Minister for Ecological Transition and Territorial Cohesion: “At a time when governments are negotiating an international treaty against plastic pollution in Ottowa  the groundbreaking of CARBIOS’ biorecycling plant is particularly significant. It illustrates France's commitment to the ecological transition  and demonstrates our ability to turn challenges into opportunities for a more sustainable future. This plant  a world first  embodies French innovation in responding to complex environmental challenges  offering a sustainable solution for a future where plastic and textile waste will be transformed into valuable resources for a truly circular economy.”Roland Lescure  Minister Delegate in charge of Industry: “This inauguration is emblematic of the green industrial revolution that we have been implementing for the past year: French technology that is sustainable  innovative and creates jobs. It is also emblematic of the method I am applying with all industrial sectors: the ecology of the contract. With the financial and administrative support of the French government  the new CARBIOS plant in Longlaville will remove a major technological barrier to the development of the textile recycling industry in France.”Franck Leroy  President of Région Grand-Est : « I'm proud to support the deployment of the world's first plant dedicated to the biorecycling of PET. CARBIOS is a perfect illustration of our vision of modern  responsible re-industrialisation  placing the Grand Est region at the heart of the ecological transition. This key innovation in the fight against plastic pollution will also create 150 jobs in the Longlaville area. »Emmanuel Ladent  CEO  CARBIOS : “At CARBIOS  we have turned a vision into reality with the groundbreaking of the world's first PET biorecycling plant. Our revolutionary enzymatic depolymerization technology marks the beginning of a new era in plastic recycling  moving away from dependence on oil to a circular economy fuelled by PET waste itself. CARBIOS continues its mission by collaborating with strategic partners around the world and embarking on a promising commercial and international deployment. I would like to thank our partner brands and industrial partners present  particularly L'Oréal Groupe  L'Occitane en Provence  PUMA  Suntory Beverage & Food Europe  Salomon  On  CITEO and Novonesis for their contribution to the success of this historic event.”Philippe Pouletty  Founder and Chairman of the Board of Directors of CARBIOS: “We can help save the planet thanks to science  passionate teams  private and public funding to meet industrial and commercial stakes  and loyal partners. This groundbreaking ceremony for the Longlaville plant marks the start of our industrial and commercial roll-out to make CARBIOS a world leader in plastic recycling in the coming years.”Antoine Vanlaeys  Chief Operating Officer  L'Oréal Groupe: “We are delighted to be a long-standing partner of CARBIOS: an adventure that began nearly seven years ago with the co-founding of a consortium to industrialize the biorecycling of plastic  then in 2019 with our participation in the capital increase carried out by CARBIOS through our private equity fund BOLD  Business Opportunities for L'Oréal Development. The groundbreaking ceremony for CARBIOS’ PET biorecycling plant is another key milestone. It confirms the scaling up of this pioneering technology  which contributes to the sustainable management of the plastic life cycle. We believe in the power of collaboration to build solutions for the future with our partners and get closer every day to reaching our sustainable development objectives. The partnership between L'Oréal Groupe and CARBIOS is testament to this.”The world's first PET biorecycling plantCARBIOS' technology enables PET circularity and provides an alternative raw material to fossil-based monomers  giving PET producers  waste management companies  public bodies and brands an effective solution to meet regulatory requirements and their own commitments to sustainable development. The plant will have the capacity to process 50 000 tons of prepared PET waste per year (equivalent to 2 billion colored bottles  2.5 billion food trays or 300 million T-shirts). The plant will create 150 direct and indirect jobs in the region. In October 2023  CARBIOS obtained the building and operating permits for the site.

Recyclate prices were largely stable through the second half.Delivery against strategic objectivesFurther optimisation of portfolioMineralz & Water continued its recovery  with overall performance being slightly ahead of the original recovery plan. Waterside operations demonstrated strong performance. On the soil side  the ramp-up initiated in Q2 continued to progress in line with expectations throughout the second half of the financial year. In Q4  end-of-waste status was granted for filler  in addition to the existing end-of-waste status for gravel. End-of-waste status for sand is currently under review by the authorities.The strategic review of UK Municipal remains on track for announcement by 30 June 2024.Stronger platformAs set out at the CMD  cost reduction and efficiency in both the short and longer term  remains a key focus for the Group. Renewi launched its Simplify programme in Q3  with the full targeted run-rate impact of €15m in SG&A costs reached in Q4  contributing to our medium term objective of delivering high single digit EBIT margins.Additionally  during FY24  Renewi embarked on its Future Fit digital programme  a strategic initiative expected to increase operational efficiency  asset utilisation and customer satisfaction  also supporting the Group in achieving its medium-term margin ambitions.In order to accelerate growth and increase efficiency  as of 1 May 2024 Renewi will streamline its senior leadership structure[2] and merge Commercial Waste Netherlands and Belgium under a single leader focused on delivering our strategic growth agenda. Mineralz & Water will become a part of our Specialities division[3].Organic growthTrading conditions for the Commercial Waste division remain mixed  with volumes stable in H2 versus H1. The Belgian operations benefitted from resilient demand and regulatory tailwinds  including the Vlarema8 enforcement in Flanders. In the Construction and Demolition sector of Commercial Waste Netherlands  volumes picked up slightly versus H1 but results remained impacted by the broader regional weakness. Against this backdrop  Renewi intensified its sales approach to small-to-medium sized enterprises and targeted sectors  showing promising initial results. During the period  the Group also announced its partnership with Vattenfall  a Swedish energy company. Vattenfall will purchase more than 7.5m m3 of green gas annually from Renewi organics.Renewi is expected to start supplying green gas in Q1 of FY25. The new hard plastics advanced sorting line in Acht  Netherlands was officially opened in Q4 and is expected to operate at 24 000 tonnes per year throughput as of FY25.Within Specialities  Maltha demonstrated strong performance over the year. Coolrec also performed well with increased volumes over Q4  but continued to be impacted by low plastics prices. Following a successful contractwin leveraging its refrigerator recycling expertise  Coolrec added a new and innovative waste stream to its recycling offering – electric boilers. An existing Coolrec site in the North of France will be expanded for the new line  with first volumes expected in Q4 FY25.FY24 financial summaryGroup revenue for FY24 will be slightly lower year-on-year  as expected  reflecting the mixed market backdrop and lower recyclate pricing. The benefit of ongoing cost reduction  digitisation  execution of strategic initiatives and strong momentum in several of the Group’s businesses is expected to result in an improved underlying EBIT margin performance in H2 versus H1. As a result  the Group is anticipated to report FY24 results in line with current market expectations.1Cash performance was stronger in H2 as a result of working capital management actions  the sale of the Hemweg site in Amsterdam[4] and the postponement of the commissioning of an advanced sorting line in Puurs.Core net debt[5] was €367m at 31 March 2024.A modest dividend is expected to be paid out for FY24.Notice of FY24 resultsOn 30 May 2024  Renewi will announce its full-year results and publish its annual report for FY24. https://brrmedia.news/RWI_FYFor further information: Renewi plc Anne Metz  Director of Investor Relations +31 6 4167 9233 investor.relations@renewi.com FTI Consulting Richard Mountain / Ben Fletcher +44 203 727 1340 FTI_RWI@FTIconsulting.comAbout RenewiRenewi is a pure-play recycling company with a focus on extracting value from waste and used materials rather than disposal through incineration or landfill.

The new partnership will save almost $2 million a year  reduce energy and chemical consumption  reduce carbon emissions and install new technology for better environmental performance.Karine Rougé  CEO of Veolia North America’s Municipal Water division  said  ""Veolia has been proud to support New Orleans’ dedicated efforts to modernize its wastewater treatment infrastructure since 1992  and our partnership is now focused on implementing a new generation of physical and process improvements that reimagine this vital city service. We are glad to partner with SWBNO to envision a forward-thinking plan that is a major step toward delivering newer infrastructure and better public service.”Veolia and the Sewerage and Water Board have worked together more than 30 years and have dramatically improved the environmental and financial performance of one of the city’s most vital services. The partnership has rebuilt and expanded treatment processes at the city’s two wastewater treatment plants  improving water quality and operational efficiency  while also providing extraordinary operational support during hurricanes and natural disasters. A new five-year agreement finalized this month will set the partnership on a new path toward reimagining what wastewater treatment can do for the future of the city.Ghassan Korban  Executive Director  Sewerage and Water Board of New Orleans  said  “As part of our utility’s commitment to infrastructure reliability and resiliency  as well as technology modernization  this investment will make our East Bank and West Bank wastewater treatment plants far more efficient and effective.”Digital upgrades to optimize future operationThe comprehensive investment and upgrade program supports New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell’s goal of remaking the city’s infrastructure as a source of strength and a framework for growth and renewal. Veolia will install its cutting-edge digital monitoring and analysis tools to continually optimize the performance of New Orleans’ wastewater system  allowing it to perform better  use less energy  generate less waste  emit fewer greenhouse gases  and reduce the potential generation of unpleasant odors:New digital monitoring systems will make it easier for plant operators to manage changing conditions and optimize the treatment process  providing real-time monitoring of wastewater treatment for the first time.A new system for receiving  storing and treating sludge at the East Bank facility will improve efficiency  provide more odor control and help generate additional revenue in the future.New pumps  bar screens and other equipment will help both East Bank and West Bank plants improve operations  while new bleach storage capacity at the West Bank facility will upgrade its disinfection capability.Veolia will also install a new system to dissolve oxygen into the aerobic digestion process of wastewater treatment  eliminating the need for three truckloads a week of costly liquid oxygen supplies delivered to the plant. The new system will save almost $2 million a year  reduce chemical costs and power use by at least an estimated 10%  and eliminate an estimated 12 metric tons per month of carbon emissions.Veolia actively supports community needs and improvementsThese upgrades will continue the renewal of New Orleans’ wastewater infrastructure that has been a hallmark of Veolia’s partnership with the Sewerage and Water Board of New Orleans. Veolia has steadily improved daily operations of the wastewater treatment system since 1992  while strengthening its long-term capacity  functioning and resilience. When New Orleans’ wastewater treatment system was devastated by Hurricane Katrina and later by Hurricane Ida  flooding the wastewater treatment plants  Veolia drew on its global resources to restore service for residents and recover from the damage without waiting for federal assistance. As the top-ranked company for environmental services  Veolia intends to make the most of its global expertise to help America meet its need for sustainable growth. Last week  the group announced its ambition to double its size in the country by 2030.The renewal also provides Veolia the opportunity to continue its support of community  educational and environmental initiatives across New Orleans. Veolia has donated $35 000 to community groups in the last two years to support initiatives including producing the New Orleans East Festival  rejuvenating Joe W. Brown Memorial Park  and establishing the Sankofa Wetland Park and Nature Trail in the Lower Ninth Ward. Veolia employees volunteer with the Sankofa organization to support its community events  in alignment with Veolia’s corporate mission of ecological transformation to address the changing climate.Veolia has also established teaming agreements with Delgado Community College and the Southern University System  one of the largest historically Black college and university systems in the nation  to create mutually beneficial partnerships that drive innovation  develop talent and maintain a network within the academic community. Veolia also partners with neighboring high schools to create STEM educational opportunities for students  and students in Veolia’s internship and apprenticeship program have used that experience to join Veolia’s New Orleans team. More than 27% of Veolia’s contract spending in New Orleans is disbursed to local disadvantaged business enterprises.ABOUT VEOLIA NORTH AMERICAA subsidiary of Veolia Group  Veolia North America (VNA) offers a full spectrum of water  waste and energy management services  including water and wastewater treatment  commercial and hazardous waste collection and disposal  energy consulting and resource recovery.

Shareholders are welcome to attend the meeting in person or participate in the AGM electronically using the link below.At the AGM  John Hennessy  Chair of Dalata  will make the following statement:“In March this year we celebrated ten years since Dalata’s flotation on the stock exchange. Reaching this milestone encourages us to reflect on the strong progress and growth we have achieved during that time. In the year prior to flotation  the Group’s revenue was just over €60 million with hotel assets of €5 million. Ten years on  Dalata has become the leading hotel operator in Ireland and has significantly expanded its footprint  with 53 hotels across Ireland  the UK and Continental Europe  delivering over €600 million revenue in 2023 with hotels assets of €1.7 billion at the end of last year. We remain committed to our belief that hospitality is all about people and Dalata’s success would not have been possible without the dedication and talent of our people who continue to deliver for our customers  our shareholders  and our other stakeholders.2023 marked another record performance for the Group in terms of revenue and free cashflow generation together with strong execution of our growth strategy. We added a hotel in Amsterdam  two hotels in London and secured a building conversion opportunity in Edinburgh  representing three very commercially attractive cities in our target markets. We have embraced a culture of innovation in our determination to increase efficiency and sustainability across our business. In 2023  we successfully protected margins despite the cost inflationary environment and reduced carbon emissions per room sold whilst maintaining strong customer and employee feedback scores.2024 has commenced with good performance for our UK portfolio which is expected to achieve modest RevPARi growth on January to April 2023. We also continue to see healthy levels of corporate demand across all regions. As reported during our full year results in February  there has been lower levels of trade in Ireland. While the Dublin market continues to digest the impact of new supply  trade improved during March compared to January and February. The timing and nature of events compared to 2023 (such as the visit of US President in April 2023) in addition to the increased VAT rate from September 2023 has had an impact during the first four months. RevPAR[i]for the Group is expected to be 4% behind 2023 for the period of January to April on a ‘like for like’ basis. As we look ahead  we remain optimistic in our outlook for the remainder of the year where trade typically is driven by stronger seasonal factors  supported by a strong events calendar  flight schedules and forward bookings for May and June. We also look forward to the greater contribution from the ten hotels added to the portfolio since 2022 as they mature and the additional contribution from the four new hotels opening this year.Earlier this week we launched our refreshed Clayton and Maldron brands. Our new brands reflect our commitment to delivering value while fostering meaningful connections with our people and customers and provide an exciting platform for continued growth. We are also excited that this year will see the opening of four new Maldron hotels across the UK  all centrally located in our target cities of Liverpool  Brighton  Manchester and London. The Group has considerable firepower available for further growth in line with our ambitious and disciplined growth strategy. We remain focussed on growing in 11 key cities in the UK and establishing a presence in targeted large European cities with a strong mix of corporate and leisure demand.I feel a great sense of pride as I reflect on the growth  performance and operational enhancements we have achieved as a Group over the past ten years. The business continues to be extremely well served today  by talented and experienced people who embody the Dalata culture and vision  which together with our financial strength  positions us well as we look to the future  respond to challenges and take advantage of opportunities as they arise.”AGM detailsShareholders can access the AGM  ask questions and vote  via a virtual meeting platform.

39972,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/IRISH-RESIDENTIAL-PROPERT-16290109/news/Strategic-Review-Update-46524319/,Strategic Review Update,(marketscreener.com) Irish Residential Properties REIT plc Strategic Review Update 25-Apr-2024 / 07:00 GMT/BSTFor immediate release25 April 2024    Irish Residential Properties REIT plcStrategic Review Update On 8 J…,For immediate release25 April 2024Irish Residential Properties REIT plc(the “Company or “I-RES”)Strategic Review UpdateOn 8 January 2024  the Board of I-RES announced that it would be conducting a review to consider and evaluate all strategic options available to maximise and unlock value for shareholders in the Company (“the Strategic Review”) and would provide an initial update ahead of the Company’s AGM in May 2024. The Strategic Review commenced following the release of the Company’s Full Year Financial Results on 23 February 2024.The Strategic Review is being undertaken with specialist retained advisers and overseen by a Board sub-Committee  led by Chair Hugh Scott-Barrett with CEO designate Eddie Byrne and non-executive directors Denise Turner and Phillip Burns. A comprehensive framework has been outlined and a rigorous and extensive analysis of the potential strategic options available to maximise value for shareholders is underway.The analysis completed to date confirms the Board’s view that the Company’s investment case is underpinned by a modern portfolio of high-quality residential assets in attractive growth locations and that it has a market-leading platform which continues to deliver a strong operational performance. Moreover  the Board believes the medium-term outlook for its market and its assets is positive  with expected population growth continuing to drive increased PRS demand considerably above the current level of supply. Against these attractive longer-term dynamics  the sector has recently been characterised by shorter-term headwinds including higher interest rates  widening yields  restrictive regulation including in particular a cap on rental growth  a notable lack of liquidity in the direct market  and an upcoming election  which present challenges for delivering shareholder returns and have impacted growth.Levels of liquidity in European real estate assets  including Irish residential assets  remains at historically low levels. Savills have advised that Irish residential sector investment volumes in 2023 amounted to only c. €240 million  c. 73% below historical 10-year average volumes. Independent analysis from the Company’s advisers has also observed that  based on current market dynamics  a strategy that requires an accelerated sale of all the Company’s assets in the direct market  including to occupiers and social providers such as the government  would be challenging to maximise value for shareholders in the short-term. These options  alongside a potential sale of the Company  will continue to be explored in detail as the Strategic Review continues. Shareholders should note that the Company confirms that it has not received any proposals to acquire the assets  in whole or in part  or the entirety of the share capital of the Company to date.The Strategic Review has identified several initiatives with the potential to unlock the inherent value contained within the I-RES operating platform including  for example  further potential of revenue generation from car parking. Additionally  the Strategic Review continues to explore value maximisation through selective asset recycling including  where appropriate  achieving value through the sale of individual units which are accretive to value.The Company has conducted extensive tax analysis as part of the Strategic Review  including a review of the REIT structure. The Irish REIT structure provides liquidity and tax efficiency to shareholders within a regulatory framework and has significant advantages over non-REIT structures. However  the Board notes that certain elements of the Irish REIT framework remain restrictive when compared to other European jurisdictions. As part of a consultation process underway by the Department of Finance on the Irish Funds sector  the Company has raised several observations seeking to bring the Irish REIT framework in line with European peers and provide significant flexibility to the Company both operationally and strategically. The outcome of this Funds Review is expected to be published in the second half of 2024.As the Strategic Review continues  the Board’s focus remains on operational efficiency initiatives and recycling capital by way of value enhancing opportunistic sales. I-RES is unique in the Irish market by virtue of its scale  its fully integrated operating platform  and its public market listing. In seeking to further leverage these advantages  the Board is also exploring potential consolidation opportunities in the Irish market as part of the Strategic Review. The Board remains open minded to all value maximising options  as well as future growth opportunities should the macroeconomic and sector backdrop continue to evolve favourably.The Company looks forward to further engagement with shareholders  including at the forthcoming AGM on 10 May 2024 and will publish further updates as appropriate but no later than the release of the Company’s 2024 Interim Results in August.ENDFor further information please contact:For Investor Relations at Irish Residential Properties REIT plc:Luke Ferriter  Investor Relations investors@iresreit.ie Tel: +353 (0) 1 563 4000Eddie Byrne  Chief Executive Officer Designate Tel: +353 (0) 1 563 4000For Media Queries:Padraig McKeon  I-RES PR and Communications Tel: + 353 (0) 87 231 2632Jonathan Neilan  FTI Consulting ires@fticonsulting.com Tel: +353 (0) 86 231 4135About Irish Residential Properties REIT plcIrish Residential Properties REIT plc (“I-RES”) is a growth oriented Real Estate Investment Trust providing quality professionally managed homes in sustainable communities in Ireland.

At the end of the period  the market resumed a less turbulent rhythm  reflected in the fall in rates  which nevertheless remained significantly higher than in 2023.The air freight market benefited both from the transfer of certain sea freight shipments to air due to the disruption in the Red Sea and from the boom in e-commerce exports from China (70 to 80% of airline load capacity)  masking the sluggish demand for general cargo.Against this backdrop  the Group saw strong growth in its business (up 10.7% in the number of shipments on a like-for-like basis) and in volumes shipped  particularly by air (tonnage: up 26.5%).Gross profit rose by 15.4%  benefiting from the acquisition of the Timar group on 01/04/23 (Impact +14.9%) and from the development of the Group’s key accounts.Despite sustained growth in the sea freight business (number of shipments up 9.0%)  Q1 was marked by a fall in the unit margin (down 15.3%)  which nonetheless remained well above the level of the pre-Covid period (> +50%). Overall  gross profit for sea freight was down 7.7%.The extremely buoyant air freight business in Q1 2024 (number of shipments up 15.9%) also saw a fall in unit margins (down 7.0%)  which  as with sea freight  remained well above the pre-Covid period (>30%)  leading to a 10.3% increase in gross profit for air freight.At constant scope  the road brokerage business grew by 5.3% in Q1 2024 in terms of number of shipments  with gross profit remaining stable.The contribution from the Timar group acquisition boosted gross profit in this business line by 79.9%.BREAKDOWN BY BUSINESS LINENUMBER OF SHIPMENTS GROSS PROFIT (€m) At current scope and exchange rates Q1 2024 Q1 2023 ChangeQ1 2024/Q1 2023 Q1 2024 Q1 2023 ChangeQ1 2024/ Q1 2023 Sea freight 33 917 31 125 +9.0% 15.5 16.6 -6.6% Air freight 23 096 19 932 +15.9% 9.5 8.6 +10.3% Road Brokerage 19 391 18 416 +5.3% 7.0 3.9 +79.9% Other* 9 662 8 297 +16.5% 2.7 1.0 +168.8% TOTAL CONSOLIDATED 86 066 77 770 +10.7% 34.7 30.1 +15.4%*: Other businesses: Rail/Customs/LogisticsVOLUMES At current scope and exchange rates Q1 2024 Q1 2023 Q1 2024/ Q1 2023 Sea freight 59 087 TEUs* 58 925 TEUs* +0.3% Air freight 20 217T** 15 986T** +26.5%*: Twenty-foot equivalent units**: TonsQ1 2024 HIGHLIGHTSSigning of the sale agreement for the acquisition of 42.06% of the share capital of Clasquin by SAS Shipping Agencies Services Sàrl (“SAS”)Following the press releases dated 4 December 2023 and 21 March 2024 and after completion of the information and consultation procedures with the relevant employee representative bodies of Clasquin  which issued a favourable opinion  on 28 March 2024  Yves Revol  OLYMP and SAS Shipping Agencies Services Sàrl (“SAS”)  a subsidiary of MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company SA  signed a sale agreement for the acquisition of 42.06% of the share capital of Clasquin by SAS  at a price of EUR 142.03 per share.Note that:completion of the transaction  which will be subject to obtaining clearances from the competent regulatory authorities  is expected to happen by year end.Upon completion of the transaction  SAS will file a tender offer with the Autorité des Marchés Financiers (AMF) for the remaining shares in the capital of Clasquin  at the same price of EUR 142.03 per share.

This reflects an exceptional base effect in the First Quarter of 2023  due to a large one-off project.

Data may be subject to rounding.Organic Growth for named markets excludes Travel Retail.This press release is also available from our website: www.pernod-ricard.comDefinitions and reconciliation of non-IFRS measures to IFRS measuresPernod Ricard’s management process is based on the following non-IFRS measures which are chosen for planning and reporting. The Group’s management believes these measures provide valuable additional information for users of the financial statements in understanding the Group’s performance. These non-IFRS measures should be considered as complementary to the comparable IFRS measures and reported movements therein.Organic growth- Organic growth is calculated after excluding the impacts of exchange rate movements  acquisitions and disposals and changes in applicable accounting principles and hyperinflation.- Exchange rates impact is calculated by translating the current year results at the prior year’s exchange rates.- For acquisitions in the current year  the post-acquisition results are excluded from the organic movement calculations. For acquisitions in the prior year  post-acquisition results are included in the prior year but are included in the organic movement calculation from the anniversary of the acquisition date in the current year.- Where a business  brand  brand distribution right or agency agreement was disposed of  or terminated  in the prior year  the Group  in the organic movement calculations  excludes the results for that business from the prior year. For disposals or terminations in the current year  the Group excludes the results for that business from the prior year from the date of the disposal or termination.- The impact of hyperinflation on Net Sales and PRO in Turkey is excluded from P&L organic growth calculations by capping unit local price/cost increases to a maximum of +26% per year  equivalent to +100% over 3 years.- This measure enables to focus on the performance of the business which is common to both years and which represents those measures that local managers are most directly able to influence.Profit from recurring operationsProfit from recurring operations corresponds to the operating profit excluding other non-current operating income and expenses.About Pernod RicardPernod Ricard is a worldwide leader in the spirits and wine industry  blending traditional craftsmanship  state-of-the-art brand-building  and global distribution technologies.

At 31 March 2024  the Group’s sales totalled €194.3m  up 7.6% compared with the same period in 2023. Given an unfavourable foreign exchange effect of €2.2m  largely linked to Asian currencies  revenue at CER1 was up 8.8% over the period.Geographical breakdown of consolidated Group revenue (IFRS)In millions of euros at 31 March 2024 Q1 2023*Q1 2024% changeQ1 2024At CER1% changeSales in EMEA 89.0 83.9 -5.8% 83.6 -6.2% Sales in the Americas 47.5 57.4 +21% 57.0 +20.1% Sales in Asia 44.1 52.9 +20% 55.9 +26.8% Total 180.6 194.3 +7.6% 196.5 +8.8%*Revenue for Q1 2023 has been restated to include Intrasense  which has been consolidated since 1 January 2023.In the EMEA region  the Group generated revenue of €83.9m in the first quarter  down 5.8% (-6.2% at CER) mainly owing to the dip in sales volumes in France. This trend stems directly from the implementation on 1 March 2024 of the reform of the supply circuit for contrast products  which caused difficulties in order intakes with radiologists. The Group expects to largely catch up on the resulting delays in sales in the second quarter of 2024.In the Americas  sales totalled €57.4m  up 21.0% over the period (+20.1% at CER). Sales caught up strongly for the second consecutive quarter following the return to historic production levels at the Raleigh site in North Carolina.Group revenue in Asia was €52.9m  with continued strong growth momentum (+20%) driven by the performances of China  South Korea and Japan. The total includes a negative currency effect (-€3.0m) linked in particular to the further depreciation of the yen. At CER  sales in Asia rose 26.8% in first-quarter 2024  confirming the Group’s ambitions in this region.Breakdown of consolidated Group revenue (IFRS) by activityIn millions of euros at 31 March 2024 Q1 2023*Q1 2024% changeQ1 2024At CER1% changeDiagnostic Imaging 160.8 173.6 +7.9% 175.5 +9.1% MRI 60.7 58.2 -4.1% 58.4 -3.7% X-ray 100.2 115.4 +15.2% 117.1 +16.9% Interventional Imaging 19.8 20.7 +4.4% 21.0 +6.1% Total 180.6 194.3 +7.6% 196.5 +8.8%1 Constant exchange rates: the exchange rate impact was eliminated by recalculating sales for the period on the basis of the exchange rates used for the previous financial year.*Revenue for Q1 2023 has been restated to include Intrasense  which has been consolidated since 1 January 2023.Diagnostic Imaging revenue increased 7.9% in Q1 2024 (+9.1% at CER) to €173.6m.MRI activity was down 3.7% at CER. This decline resulted from the postponement of several substantial orders in the MRI franchise (Dotarem ® / Elucirem TM ) in France  all of which will be booked in the second quarter of 2024.activity was down 3.7% at CER. This decline resulted from the postponement of several substantial orders in the MRI franchise (Dotarem / Elucirem ) in France  all of which will be booked in the second quarter of 2024. X-ray revenue increased 16.9% at CER over the period  a remarkable increase driven by all the division’s products  particularly Xenetix®.In Interventional Imaging  revenue rose 6.1% at CER in Q1 2024 on continued favourable momentum for Lipiodol®  fuelled by volumes and prices alike.All financial targets confirmed for 2024The highly positive trend overall at the start of the year boosts Guerbet’s confidence for the full year. In a buoyant contrast products market  Group business will be bolstered by the ramp-up of the MRI franchise  growth in Optiray® sales  and continued favourable momentum for Lipiodol®. At the same time  operating profitability will benefit from the change in the product mix and the continued rise in prices  while cash generation will improve considerably  particularly as inventory levels return to normal.Given these circumstances  Guerbet is confirming its forecast of sales growth of over 8% in 2024 like-for-like and at CER and expects its adjusted EBITDA margin rate to exceed that of 2021 (14.4%). Free cash flow is expected to be in positive territory for the full year.Next events :Annual Shareholders' Meeting for fiscal year 202324 May 2024Publication of 1st half 2024 revenue25 July 2024 after market closeAbout GuerbetAt Guerbet  we build lasting relationships so that we enable people to live better.

In March 2024  the occupancy rate in this segment was 90.2%.1.2 - Specialized Care:The Specialized Care segment generated €337 million of revenue in the first quarter of 2024  25.8% of the Group total  equating to growth of 4.8% as reported and +5.1% in organic terms.In particular  this performance was driven by:The medical and rehabilitation care sub-segment: new technical platforms came into service and new areas of specialist care were developed  particularly in oncology and neurology;The mental health sub-segment: the integration of Grupo 5 in Spain in 2023 has significantly strengthened the Group’s business in this sector.Revenue from outpatient activities (consultations and partial hospitalisation) rose by more than 7.1% (around 7.3% on an organic basis).1.3 - Community CareRevenue in the Community Care segment  whose brands include Petits-fils and Ages & Vie in France  amounted to €169 million in the first quarter of 2024 (12.9% of the Group total)  representing growth of 22.3% as reported or 14.4% on an organic basis.2 - Performance by geographical zone2.1 - FranceIn millions of euros First quarter 2023 First quarter 2024 Reported growth Organic growth Revenue 535 579 +8.2% +7.0%In the first quarter  revenue growth in France was strong (7.0% in organic terms) in all business segments.Organic revenue growth in the Long-Term Care segment was 6.4%.

Operating conditions continued to be affected by the very high inflation of the last two years  and price increases negotiated in 2023 did not fully make up for that inflation. However  the time lag between the impact of inflation and price increases should be gradually eliminated in 2024 and 2025 by new pricing measures currently being negotiated.Looking at individual business segments:The Long-Term Care segment posted organic growth of 7.2%  supported by price rises and an occupancy rate that rose from 86.9% in the first quarter of 2023 to 88.8% in the first quarter of 2024.

These risks are described in the notes to the 2023 financial statements  which are available on the company’s website www.clariane.com.As part of the Refinancing Plan announced on 14 November 2023  the Company completed its first two stages in December 2023:Formation of the Gingko real-estate partnership  raising €140 million (see press release of 15 December 2023) followed by the Juniper real-estate partnership  which raised €90 million (see press release of 28 December 2023);Arrangement of a €200 million real-estate-backed bridge term loan with Crédit Agricole Mutuel de Paris et d’Ile de France (CADIF)  LCL and Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank (CACIB).As regards the capital increase  the process is continuing:The AMF has granted Predica  a subsidiary of the Crédit Agricole Assurances Group and Clariane’s largest shareholder  exemption from the requirement to file a draft tender offer (in the event that Predica crosses the 30% threshold as a result of the capital increase) based on Articles 234-8  234-9(2) and 234-10 of the AMF’s General Regulation (AMF decision no. 224C0227 of 8 February 2024).Crédit Agricole Assurances  which holds 24.7% of the share capital and voting rights via Predica  has undertaken to subscribe  subject to the fulfilment of the Conditions Precedent and market standard conditions for this type of transaction  (i) by irrevocable entitlement in proportion to its equity stake by exercising all the preferential subscription rights it will receive and (ii) by using its entitlement subject to reduction in a cash subscription amount equal to the difference between €200 million and the total amount of its subscription by irrevocable entitlement.The Company has also received expressions of interest from banks to underwrite  subject to conditions precedent  the remainder of the capital increase  i.e. up to a maximum of €100 million.The adoption by Clariane’s shareholders of the resolutions relating to the €300 million capital increase in the 26 March 2024 Combined General Meeting of Shareholders is a further step towards its completion  scheduled for late June 2024 or September 2024.The transaction remains subject to the fulfilment of the following conditions precedent:Authorisation from the relevant competition authorities for Crédit Agricole Assurances’ possible acquisition of control over Clariane in the event that Crédit Agricole Assurances’ subscription to the Capital Increase leads to such an acquisition of control;An amendment to the terms and conditions of the OCEANE bonds maturing in 2027 (0.875% – FR0013489739) in order to prevent early redemption from being triggered in the event that Crédit Agricole Assurances acquires control over Clariane through the capital increase;Submission by the independent appraiser appointed by the Company’s Board of Directors of a fairness opinion confirming the fairness of the terms and conditions of the capital increase and the related agreements  including the underwriting commitments;Approval of the prospectus for the capital increase by the AMF.It should be noted that the capital increase will provide for shareholders’ preferential subscription rights to be maintained so that shareholders can subscribe to it in order to maintain their stake while taking advantage of the discount. Otherwise  shareholders who do not wish to exercise their preferential subscription rights will be subject to significant dilution  which may be offset in whole or in part by the sale of their preferential subscription rights.Lastly  the Company points out that the capital increase is an essential condition of its plan to strengthen its financial position and that if it is not carried out  the Company would be obliged to place itself under appropriate protection in order to renegotiate its debt with its creditors.As regards the asset disposal programme  intended in particular to refocus the Group’s business geographically and to raise around €1 billion of gross disposal proceeds  the Group has so far sold:Its 50% stake in a real-estate portfolio in the Netherlands to its partner Aedifica for a total agreed sale value of around €25 million;All of its business activities and assets in the United Kingdom  via an OpCo/PropCo deal  to Elevation Specialized Care Property  a UK real-estate investment fund specialising in retirement homes and Specialized Care facilities and managed by Elevation Advisors LLP  resulting in gross disposal proceeds of £207 million (around €243 million). The assets sold were part of the Juniper real-estate partnership signed with Predica (see press release of 28 December 2023). Details of this transaction  and particularly the Group’s plans for using the proceeds  are described in the press release relating to the disposal  published on 28 February 2024. It should be noted that the net proceeds from the disposal of this business will contribute to the repayment of approximately €150 million of the Group’s outstanding debt  but will not have a significant impact on leverage.With the sale of its business in the United Kingdom and six real-estate assets in the Netherlands announced on 5 February 2024  the Group has already completed over a quarter of the asset disposal programme in the first three months of 2024. It is actively pursuing that programme and several deals are in the pipeline  particularly in Benelux.On 4 April  Clariane also confirmed that it had held an information meeting with members of the Central Workforce Relations and Economic Committee  in accordance with applicable French regulations  about the possible disposal of its hospital home care and home nursing services business in France. The Group currently has eight specialist hospital home care facilities and three home nursing services agencies in France  which employ 309 people (full-time equivalent). In 2023  this business generated just over €46 million of revenue. As of the date of the present press release  the Group had not received any firm offer to acquire this business.4 - Outlook for 2024In 2024  the Group will continue to focus on improving its performance in a balanced way and on maintaining a high level of quality in all its activities  in line with its “At your side” corporate project.Clariane expects organic revenue growth to remain above 5%  supported by a steady increase in business volumes and ongoing price adjustments.Given the expected absence of any contribution from real-estate development activities in 2024  EBITDA excluding IFRS 16 and excluding expected disposals should remain stable in value.As regards non-financial indicators and adjusted for changes in scope resulting from the disposal plan  Clariane has set quantitative targets for the 19 indicators on its new CSR roadmap. In particular  it is aiming to:Maintain a net promoter score (NPS) of at least 40 among residents/patients and families;Continue having more than 7 000 staff members undertaking training courses leading to qualifications  in line with its purpose-driven commitments;Reduce its lost-time accident frequency rate by at least a further 8 points;Implement a low-carbon energy trajectory compatible with the Paris Agreements and validated by the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi).These targets will be adjusted to take into account changes in scope resulting from the disposal plan.In line with the refinancing plan presented on 14 November  the Group has prioritised improving cash flow generation and controlling debt levels. In terms of expenditure  the Group will maintain its maintenance spending at a normal level  which should be around €100 million. Growth investments are expected to average around €200 million in 2024 and 2025  much less than in 2023.Finally  the Group is aiming to reduce its leverage ratio to below 3.0x and its LTV to 55% by the end of 2025. The speed with which the Group reduces its debt and gearing in 2024 will be closely related to pace at which the Refinancing Plan announced on 14 November 2023 is implemented  through the €1 billion disposal programme and the completion of the planned capital increase.As the leverage ratio was greater than 3.5x at 31 December 2023  the Group reiterates that it will not pay a dividend in respect of 2023  in accordance with the terms of its unsecured syndicated loan agreement.Finally  the Group will present its medium-term plan to the market on 21 May 2024.5 - In relation to the present press release  the Group will hold:A conference call in English at 3.00pm CEST on 26 April 2024You can take part in the conference call bycalling one of the following numbers: Paris: +33 (0)1 70 37 71 66 UK: +44 (0)33 0551 0200 US: +1 786 697 3501You can watch the live webcast here .A playback of the conference call will be available here.The presentation used in the conference call will be available on Clariane’s website (www.clariane.com) from 12pm (CET).6 - Forthcoming eventsThe Group will present its medium-term plan to the market on 21 May 2024About ClarianeClariane is the leading European community for care in times of vulnerability.

Postponed delivery of tablets for nurses also impacted Q1 revenue growth  although the shortfall should be made up in the coming quarters. The favorable scope effect is due to the integration of Visiodent from March 1  2024.Other French subsidiaries posted growth of 3.6%  buoyed by continued expansion of HR activities  which is being driven notably by their new partner networks. The insurance segment made a smaller contribution to the division’s growth. The pharmacy segment was impacted by an unfavorable comparison basis for its equipment installation and updating activities  both of which experienced strong growth in 2023 as clients prepared to integrate functionalities related to the French health authorities’ Ségur program.International subsidiaries’ Q1 revenue grew 6.6% like for like  spurred by both the UK pharmacy segment  which is benefiting from the launch of the NHS’s Pharmacy First service  and expansion of the hospital activity in Spain’s Murcia region.

The share price of CVC  one of the largest ...,(CTN News) – Euronext CEO Stéphane Boujnah told on Friday that the highly anticipated trading debut of private equity group CVC Capital Partners shows that the European IPO market is once again on track.The share price of CVC  one of the largest private equity firms in the world  was approximately 24% higher at approximately 12:30 p.m. Eastern Standard Time.There was an opening price of more than 17 euros ($18.25) per share  which was significantly higher than the 14 euro offer price  indicating that there is strong investor demand for this company. As one of Europe’s largest IPOs this year  the IPO is widely expected to be a record-breaker.CVC anticipates raising between 2 billion and 2.3 billion euros from the deal.

Key target indications for the autoimmune platform include graft-versus-host-disease (GvHD)  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  and now systemic sclerosis (SSc).Following the merger in October 2022  BioSenic combined the strategic positionings and strengths of Medsenic and Bone Therapeutics. The merger specifically enables Medsenic/Biosenic to develop an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/oral ATO (OATO).BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About the main Medsenic/BioSenic technology platformThe ATO platform provides derived active products with immunomodulatory properties and fundamental effects on the activated cells of the immune system. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. cGvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT).Medsenic has been successful in a phase 2 trial with its intravenous formulation  Arscimed®  which has orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA. The company is heading towards an international phase 3 confirmatory study  with its new  IP-protected  OATO formulation. Another selected target is moderate-to-severe forms of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae  and the gastrointestinal tract). Systemic sclerosis is now full part of the clinical pipeline of Medsenic/BioSenic. This serious chronic disease badly affects skin  lungs  or vascularization  and has no current effective treatment. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive  giving good grounds to launch a phase 2 clinical protocol  using new immunomodulatory formulations of APIs recognized to be active on the immune system.Story continuesThe company is currently focusing its present R&D and clinical activities on a selective  accelerated development of its autoimmune platform.Note: The allogeneic cell therapy platform-originating from the previous listed company Bone Therapeutics company  may be of renewed interest by using isolated and purified differentiated bone marrow Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) as a starting material for further isolation of passive or active biological subcellular elements. Indeed  these cells may provide new subcellular vesicles potentially able to deliver a unique and proprietary approach to organ repair. BioSenic is now involved in determining new patentable approaches in this complex area of cell therapy.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAFrançois Rieger  PhD  CEOTel: +33 (0)671 73 31 59investorrelations@biosenic.comCertain statements  beliefs and opinions in this press release are forward-looking  which reflect the company or  as appropriate  the company directors’ current expectations and projections about future events.
