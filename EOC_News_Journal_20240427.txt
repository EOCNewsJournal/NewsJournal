Many high-ranking representatives in our government have already spoken about the issues of our financial  economic and material response to this step (confiscation)  which we are warning our opponents  as before  not to take "" RIA quoted Ryabkov as saying.Moscow is considering both economic and diplomatic responses.""We are now studying the optimal form of reaction  where countermeasures include actions against the assets of our Western opponents as well as diplomatic response measures "" Ryabkov said  refraining from giving further details.""Among the countermeasures  there may also be actions against the assets of our Western opponents "" he said.Although no formal downgrade of relations has been announced since Russia launched its special military operation in Ukraine in February 2022  the Kremlin has described the current level of diplomatic ties between the United States and Russia as ""below zero"".In related news  US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Thursday that Washington welcomed what she called a ""very constructive step"" taken by the European Union to segregate the proceeds from assets held by Brussels-based Euroclear and transfer them to Ukraine  noting future interest could also be pulled forward to expand funds available for Ukraine.""This is an approach that could be broadly supported by countries that are concerned about the seizure of assets  and some of the interest could be brought forward through  for example  a loan "" Yellen said in a Reuters Next interview in Washington.The senior US official claimed this unprecedented method of funneling Russia's money to Kiev was among several options being discussed by the G7 ahead of a leaders' summit scheduled next month.The US Senate on Tuesday voted to pass a foreign aid package that includes long-stalled aid for Israel and Ukraine. The bill  which US President Joe Biden signed into law on Wednesday  also includes measures to confiscate frozen Russian assets for funding Ukraine.Meanwhile  Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov has described the West's plans to provide Kiev with the proceedings derived from seized Russian assets as ""thievish ... in the literal sense.""""They are thievish  we realized this a long time ago.

Proposal for resolution on: employee option program; and directed issue of warrants and approval of transfer of warrants Background The board of directors of Saniona AB  Reg. No. 556962-5345 (the ""Company"")  proposes that the annual shareholders' meeting on 29 May 2024 resolves to adopt an employee option program for the CEO  other senior executives and other employees in accordance with what is set out under A below. The purpose of the proposed employee option program (the ""Employee Option Program 2024"") is to secure a long-term commitment for employees through a compensation system which is linked to the Company's future value growth. Through the implementation of a share-based incentive program  the future value growth in the Company is encouraged  which implies common interests and goals for the shareholders of the Company and the participants. Such share-based incentive program is also expected to increase the Company's possibilities to retain competent persons. Further details of the Employee Option Program 2024 are set out under Section A below. In order to secure the Company's undertakings under the Employee Option Program 2024  the board of directors also proposes that the annual shareholders' meeting resolves on a directed issue of warrants and an approval of transfer of warrants in accordance with Section B below. The board of directors' proposal on implementation of Employee Option Program 2024 The board of directors proposes that the annual shareholders' meeting resolves to implement the Employee Option Program 2024 in accordance with the following substantial guidelines: The Employee Option Program 2024 shall comprise a maximum of 3 045 000 employee options. Each employee option entitles the holders a right to acquire one new share in the Company against cash consideration at an exercise price amounting to 130 per cent of the volume weighted average share price of the Company's share on Nasdaq Stockholm during the 10 trading days immediately after the annual shareholders' meeting on 29 May 2024  however not less than SEK 2.678. The thus calculated exercise price shall be rounded to the nearest whole öre  whereupon 0.5 öre shall be rounded upwards. The exercise price can however not be lower than the share's quotient value. The exercise price and the number of shares that each option entitles right to may be subject to recalculation in the event of a bonus issue  split  rights issue etc.  wherein the recalculation terms in the complete terms and conditions of the warrants shall be applied. The Employee Option Program 2024 shall comprise the CEO  other senior executives and other employees. The board of directors shall resolve the number of employee options to be allotted to each participant in Employee Option Program 2024  whereby participants in each category listed below can be alloted up to the maximum number of employee options listed below: Participant category Maximum number of employee optionsCEO Up to 1 855 000 options Senior executives (4 persons) Up to 200 000 options per participant Directors (5 persons) Up to 40 000 options per participant Scientists (6 persons) Up to 20 000 options per participant Other employees (approximately 14 persons) Up to 5 000 options per participant Allotment shall take place no later than 31 December 2024. The allotted employee options will vest with 1/3 each on the date that falls 12  24 and 36 months  respectively  following the date of allotment. If the number of allotted employee options is not evenly divisible with 1/3  the number of vested employee options shall be rounded downwards to the nearest whole number and any excess employee options shall be considered vested on the last vesting date. Vesting is conditional upon that the participant continues to be employed within the Saniona group (the "" Group "") and has not terminated the employment as of the date when the respective vesting occurs. If the participant ceases to be employed or terminates its employment within the Group before a vesting date  the already vested employee options may be exercised on the ordinary date of exercise in accordance with the below  but further vesting will not occur. However  if the participant's employment is terminated due to dismissal or due to personal reasons/breach of contract  vested employee options shall also lapse. The employee options shall not constitute securities and shall not be possible to transfer or pledge. However  in the event of death  the rights to vested employee options shall accrue to the beneficiaries of the holder of the employee options. The employee options shall be allotted without consideration. The holders can exercise allotted and vested employee options during the period starting on the date that falls 3 years after the allotment date and ending on 31 December 2029. The board of directors has the right to limit the number of occasions during the exercise period when the employee options can be exercised. In the event of a public take-over offer  asset sale  liquidation  merger or any other such transaction affecting the Company  the employee options will vest in their entirety and be exercisable in connection with the relevant transaction. Participation in Employee Option Program 2024 is conditional upon that such participation can legally take place  and that such participation in the Company's assessment can take place with reasonable administrative costs and financial efforts. The employee options shall be governed by separate agreements with the participants. The board of directors shall be responsible for the preparation and management of Employee Option Program 2024 in accordance with the above-mentioned substantial terms and guidelines. Proposal on resolution on directed issue of warrants and approval of transfer of warrants In order to enable the Company's delivery of shares under the Employee Option Program 2024  the board of directors proposes that the annual shareholders' meeting resolves on a directed issue of warrants and 2approval of transfer of warrants. The board of directors thus proposes that the annual shareholders' meeting resolves on a directed issue of warrants in accordance with the following terms and conditions: A maximum of 3 045 000 warrants shall be issued. With deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  the warrants may only be subscribed for by the Company or a subsidiary in the Group. The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights is that the warrants are issued as part of the implementation of the Employee Option Program 2024. In the light of what has been stated under the Section Background above  the board of directors considers that it is for the benefit of the Company and its shareholders that employees are offered to participate in the Employee Option Program 2024. Subscription shall be made no later than 30 November 2024. Over subscription cannot occur. The warrants shall be issued without consideration. The reason hereof is due to that the warrants shall be issued as part of the implementation of the Employee Option Program 2024. The warrants and the exercise of the subscription rights are subject to the enclosed terms and conditions for the warrants 2024/2029; Appendix A   (the "" Warrant Terms and Conditions ""). The Warrant Terms and Conditions state among others: that each warrant entitles to subscription of one share in the Company at a subscription price amounting to 130 per cent of the volume weighted average share price of the Company's share on Nasdaq Stockholm during the 10 trading days immediately after the annual shareholders' meeting on 29 May 2024  however not less than SEK 2.678. The thus calculated subscription price shall be rounded to the nearest whole öre  whereupon 0.5 öre shall be rounded upwards. The subscription price can however not be lower than the share's quotient value and the part of the subscription price exceeding the share's quotient value shall be added to the free share premium reserve; that subscription of shares by virtue of the warrants may be made from registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office up to and including 31 December 2029; that the subscription price and the number of shares that each warrant entitles right to subscribe for are subject to customary recalculation in accordance with Clause 8 of the Warrant Terms and Conditions; that the period when the subscription right may be utilized may be brought forward or postponed in accordance with Clause 8 of the Warrant Terms and Conditions; and that the shares issued upon utilization of a warrant shall confer right to dividends in accordance with Clause 7 of the Warrant Terms and Conditions. If all warrants are exercised for subscription of new shares  the share capital will increase with SEK 152 250. The chairman of the Company's board of directors shall be entitled to make such minor adjustments of the issue resolution that might be necessary in connection with registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office. 3Further  the board of directors proposes that the annual shareholders' meeting shall resolve to approve that the Company or another company in the Group  may transfer warrants to the participants in the Employee Option Program 2024 (or to a financial intermediary assisting with the delivery of shares to participants in Employee Option Program 2024) without consideration in connection with the exercise of employee options in accordance with the terms and conditions under Section A above. _____________________ Costs  impact on key ratios  dilution and previous incentive programs etc. The Employee Option Program 2024 will be accounted for in accordance with ""IFRS 2 - Share based payments"". IFRS 2 stipulates that the options shall be expensed as personnel costs over the vesting period and will be accounted for directly against equity. Personnel costs in accordance with IFRS 2 do not affect the Company's cash flow. The board of directors has made the assessment that the Employee Option Program 2024 will not trigger any social costs for the Company. The employee options do not have a market value since they are not transferable. However  the board of directors has calculated a theoretical value of the employee options using the ""Black Scholes"" formula. Assuming that all options are allotted and assuming a share price at the time of allotment of the options of SEK 1.80  a strike price of SEK 2.34  a volatility of 71 per cent  a risk free interest of 2.5 per cent and that 100 per cent of the employee options are vested  the value of an employee option has been calculated to SEK 0.81 and the total personnel cost for the Employee Option Program 2024 in accordance with IFRS 2 is estimated to be approximately SEK 2.4 million before tax during the period 2024-2027. Under the same conditions  but assuming that only 50 per cent of the employee options are vested  the total personnel cost for the Employee Option Program 2024 in accordance with IFRS 2 is estimated to approximately SEK 1.2 million before tax during the same period. It shall be noted that the calculations are based on preliminary assumptions and are only intended to provide an illustration of the outcome. As per the date of the notice to the annual shareholders' meeting  the number of shares in the Company amounts to 111 238 252. In case all warrants issued in relation to Employee Option Program 2024 are exercised for subscription of new shares  a total of 3 045 000 new shares will be issued  which corresponds to a dilution of approximately 2.66 per cent of the Company's share capital and votes after full dilution  calculated on the number of shares that will be added upon full exercise of all warrants issued in relation to Employee Option Program 2024. The dilution would only have had a marginal impact on the key figure earnings per share for the full year 2023. The Company currently has several outstanding option programs. For a description of these programs  please see note 12 in the annual report for 2023. As of the date of this notice  options entitling to subscription of in the aggregate 4 581 729 new shares are outstanding in the previous programs. In case all warrants issued in relation to Employee Option Program 2024 as well as all warrants issued in relation to options in existing incentive programs that can still be exercised are exercised for subscription of new shares  a total of 7 626 729 new shares will be issued  which corresponds to a dilution of approximately 6.42 per cent of the Company's share capital and votes after full dilution  calculated on the number of shares that will be added upon full exercise of all outstanding and proposed warrants. 4The above calculations regarding dilution do not take into account the shares that may be issued upon exercise of the warrants series TO 4 that were issued within the framework of the rights issue that was completed in early 2024. The above calculations regarding dilution and impact on key ratios are furthermore subject to recalculation of the warrants in accordance with the customary recalculation terms set out in the complete terms and conditions for the warrants. Preparation of the proposal This proposal has been prepared by the board of directors and its Remuneration Committee in consultation with external advisers. Majority requirements The resolutions in accordance with Section A and B above shall be resolved upon as one resolution. The resolutions are subject to the provisions in Chapter 16 of the Swedish Companies Act. A valid resolution requires that the resolution is supported by shareholders representing at least nine-tenths of the votes cast as well as of all shares represented at the annual shareholders' meeting. ____________________ Malmö in April 2024 Saniona AB (publ) The Board of Directors 5The English text is an unofficial translation.

IntroductionThe Executive Management is defined as the Chief Executive Officer and other members of the management team. The purpose of these guidelines is to clarify the compensation as decided.The guidelines are forward-looking  i.e. they are applicable to remuneration agreed  and amendments to remuneration already agreed  after adoption of the guidelines by the annual general meeting. The general meeting has the right to agree on additional remunerations outside of these guidelines.2. Remuneration CommitteeThe remuneration committee evaluates and considers matters regarding remuneration and employment terms and prepares proposals for guidelines for compensation to the CEO and executive management. The Board of Directors shall evaluate a proposal for new guidelines at least every fourth year and submit it to the AGM. The guidelines shall be in force until new guidelines are adopted by the general meeting. The Remuneration Committee should ensure that remuneration is commensurate with prevailing market conditions for corresponding executives in other companies  and accordingly  that the company’s offering to its employees is competitive. The CEO’s compensation is approved by the Board of Directors. Compensation to other senior executives is decided by the CEO after consulting with the Remuneration Committee. The members of the remuneration committee are independent of the company and its executive management. The CEO and other members of the executive management do not participate in the board of directors’ processing of and resolutions regarding remuneration-related matters in so far as they are affected by such matters.3. Remuneration Principles and the guidelines’ promotion of the company’s business strategy  long-term interests and sustainabilityFingerprint Cards aims to attract  engage  develop and retain the right people to drive our business result in line with the company’s business strategy. In order to support this  the design and implementation of our remuneration structure shall be performance based; affordable; sustainable; market driven and clear. Compensation shall reflect the scope and complexity of each role  as well as the actual performance of the individual. Fingerprint Cards does not tolerate any form of discrimination and we perform annual reviews to make sure we do not have any salary misalignments based on any discriminating factors such as gender  transgender identity or expression  ethnicity  religion or other belief  disability  sexual orientation and age.Variable remuneration covered by these guidelines shall aim at promoting Fingerprint Card’s business strategy and long-term interests  including its sustainability.For more information regarding the company’s business strategy  please see www.fingerprints.com.Remuneration under employments subject to other rules than Swedish may be duly adjusted to comply with mandatory rules or established local practice  taking into account  the overall purpose of these guidelines.Remuneration PrinciplesPerformance Based:There shall be a strong link between performance (individual - and business result) and compensation. Base salary will depend on the employee’s performance against objectives  development progress and living our company values.Competitive and Sustainable:We must create value to secure our present and future capability to pay competitive compensation and we must earn the means for our compensation. It is important to have a balance between our company earnings and our compensation levels.Market driven:Our salaries shall reflect the scope and complexity of the work. It is our objective to compare our base salaries with relevant market data for the applicable country. Each country forms its own market.The remuneration principles are also applicable to the rest of the employees at Fingerprint Cards.In the preparation of the board of directors’ proposal for these remuneration guidelines  salary and employment terms for employees of the company have been taken into account by including information on the employees’ total income  the components of the remuneration and increase and growth rate over time  in the remuneration committee’s and the board of directors’ basis of decision when evaluating whether the guidelines and the limitations set out herein are reasonable.4. Total RemunerationThe total remuneration to Executives consists primarily of monthly base salary  short-term incentives  pension  and insurances. If decided in the general meeting  the total remuneration may also include – irrespective of these guidelines – long term incentives.4.1 Short Term Incentives (STI)Short Term Incentives shall be linked to predetermined and measurable criteria. The Short-Term Incentives include company measures such as Revenue  Operating Profit and Cash Balance. For Executives  80-90 per cent of the STI is based on company measures  and 10-20 per cent is based on individual performance  with predetermined targets on an annual basis. The criteria shall be designed so as to contribute to Fingerprint Card’s business strategy and long-term interests  including its sustainability.The satisfaction of criteria for awarding STI shall be measured over a period of one or several years. The variable cash remuneration may amount to not more than 100 per cent of the total fixed base salary during the measurement period.For financial objectives  the evaluation shall be based on financial information made public by the company.4.2 PensionPension plans are based on defined contribution models  where a premium is paid amounting to not more than 30 per cent of the Executive’s fixed annual base salary.4.3 InsurancesExecutives are provided insurance coverage in accordance with local market practice. Such benefits shall be customary and be of limited amount.4.4 Termination of employmentUpon termination of an employment  the notice period may not exceed six months. During the notice period  the executive will continue to receive full base salary and other employment benefits. Upon termination by the company  severance payment could be paid and may not exceed twelve months’ base salary. When termination is made by the executive  the notice period may not exceed six months  without any right to severance pay.Additionally  remuneration may be paid for non-compete undertakings. Such remuneration  if applicable  shall amount to a maximum of 60 per cent of the monthly base salary at the time of termination of employment  unless otherwise provided by mandatory collective agreement provisions.4.5 The Board of Directors’ right to deviate from the principle of remunerationIn certain cases the Board of Directors may decide to deviate from these guidelines  in part or in total  if there are special reasons to do so in an individual case and a deviation is necessary to fulfill the company’s long term interest  including in relation to sustainability  or to safeguard the company’s financial position. As set out above  the remuneration committee’s tasks include preparing the board of directors’ resolutions in remuneration-related matters. This includes any resolutions to derogate from the guidelines.4.6 Description of significant changes and how the shareholders' views have been taken into accountThere have been no significant changes to the proposed new guidelines in relation to the remuneration guidelines adopted by the Annual General Meeting 2020. There have been no material comments on the remuneration guidelines from shareholders.Item 17 – Board of Directors’ proposal regarding authorization of the Board to decide on the repurchase and transfer of Class B treasury sharesThe Board of Directors proposes that the Meeting authorizes the Board to repurchase  on one or several occasions up until the next AGM  as many Class B shares in the Company as may be purchased without the Company's holding at any time exceeding ten (10) per cent of the total number of outstanding shares in the Company. The acquisitions shall take place on Nasdaq Stockholm and only at a price per share within the share price interval registered at that time  which means the difference between the highest buying price and the lowest selling price. Payment for the shares shall be made in cash.It is also proposed that the Board of Directors be authorized to resolve  on one or several occasions up until the next AGM  to transfer the Company's Class B shares  deviating from the shareholders' preferential rights. Transfers of Class B shares can take place on Nasdaq Stockholm. Transfer may also be made in other ways  against cash payment or against payment through set-off or contribution in kind  or otherwise with conditions. Transfers may be made of no more Class B shares than the number of such shares held by the Company at the time of the Board's decision regarding transfer. Transfers on Nasdaq Stockholm may only be carried out at a price per share within the share price interval registered at that time  which means the difference between the highest buying price and the lowest selling price. If transferred otherwise than on Nasdaq Stockholm  the share price shall be established so that it is not below market terms. However  a discount to the stock market price may apply  in line with market practice.The purpose of the authorizations is to promote efficient capital usage in the Company and to create flexibility in the Company's ability to seize attractive business opportunities by wholly or partly financing acquisitions of companies or business operations through the transfer of own shares.Item 18 – Board of Directors' proposal regarding authorization of the Board to decide on the issue of new shares with or without preferential rights for the shareholdersa) authorization of 20 per centThe Board of Directors proposes that the Meeting authorizes the Board to resolve  on one or several occasions up until the next AGM  with or without deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  on new issues of Class B shares  warrants and/or convertibles entitling to subscription of Class B shares  corresponding to no more than twenty (20) per cent of the total number of outstanding shares in the Company on the day of publication of this notice.

Background and summaryThe purpose of the proposal is to attract and retain talent over time  increase engagement and performance  and encourage personal long-term ownership in the Company. The Board of Directors believes it is in the interest of all shareholders that individuals deemed important for the Company's development  have a long-term interest in the Company's value development. The proposed program creates long-term ownership engagement  which is expected to stimulate increased interest in the business and its performance over the entire period. The Board of Directors’ intention is to propose similar programs annually to the Annual General Meeting  where the size of the program will be evaluated continuously to ensure a long-term sustainable incentive program.Warrant Program 2024/2027 means that members of the Executive Management are offered to purchase warrants at market price (""Warrants"") which each entitle the holder  after approximately three years  to subscribe for one B-share in Fingerprint. To assist participants with the initial investment  a cash bonus will be paid out to participants from Fingerprint. The payment of the subsidy will be cashflow neutral to the company and partly subsidize the participants investment. The Company has the right to invoke a clawback if a participant terminates its employment with the company within three years.Based on the terms set forth below  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves on the implementation of Warrant Program 2024/2027  as well as the issuance of Warrants to the Executive Management of Fingerprint.2. Participant categoriesThe right to subscribe for warrants shall be granted to a maximum of eleven senior executives  including the CEO  who have entered into repurchase agreements with the Company. Participants are divided into different categories based on their respective roles in the Company. The distribution of Warrants are as follows:Category 1 consists of the Chief Executive Officer (one participant) with the right to subscribe for a maximum of 5 000 000 Warrants.Category 2 consists of up to ten members of the Executive Management with the right to collectively subscribe for a maximum of 9 000 000 Warrants  whereby each participant can subscribe for a maximum of 2 500 000 Warrants.Over-subscription is not possible. In case of under-subscription  Warrants not subscribed for by any participant shall lapse.3. AllocationDecisions on participation or introduction of Warrant Program 2024/2027 require  according to the Board of Directors’ assessment  that it can be offered at reasonable administrative costs and financial effects.Warrant Program 2024/2027 may include a maximum of 14 000 000 Warrants.The Warrants can be exercised for B-shares in the Company from July 1  2027 up until October 1  2027. The period until this date constitutes the ""Vesting Period”.4.Vesting Period and exercise PriceThe Vesting Period for the Warrants shall be a maximum of three years and four months from their issuance  and the exercise period shall be from July 1  2027 up until October 1  2027.The exercise price upon the participant's exercise of the Warrants shall correspond to 235 per cent of the volume-weighted average price according to Nasdaq Stockholm's official price list for the Fingerprint B-share during the first ten (10) trading days following the Annual General Meeting on May 28  2024. The exercise of the Warrants may be made through net settlement.5. Other terms for the WarrantsIn addition to the above  the following terms shall apply to the Warrants:Participants may not transfer  pledge  or dispose of the Warrants or exercise any rights regarding the Warrants during the Vesting Period.The participant's right to subscribe for Warrants is conditioned upon (i) the participant not having resigned or been terminated from their employment with the Company at the time of subscription  (ii) subscription of Warrants being legally possible and  according to the Board of Directors’ assessment  feasible with reasonable administrative and economic efforts  and (iii) the participant and/or  if applicable  their company  having entered into a special agreement with the Company  under which the Company  or the Company designates  among other things  has the right to repurchase the Warrants from the participant/company if the participant's employment terminates and in certain other situations  at an amount equal to the market value of the Warrants and  if applicable  the lower of the market value and acquisition value of the Warrants. The Board of Directors shall have the right to make minor adjustments to the terms of the agreement deemed appropriate or necessary due to labor law or tax law regulations or administrative conditions.6. Detailed terms and administrationThe Board of Directors  through the Remuneration Committee  is responsible for the detailed design and administration of Warrant Program 2024/2027  within the framework of the terms and guidelines provided by the Annual General Meeting. For example  the Board of Directors may decide that no allocation of Warrants shall be made to a participant  despite the conditions under point 5 above being met  in cases of fraud  other criminal activities  or when a participant has acted grossly negligent.Certain deviations from or adjustments to the terms of Warrant Program 2024/2027 may be made due to local regulations and prevailing market practices or market conditions  including cash settlement instead of delivery of shares to participants under certain conditions.7. Value of and estimated costs for Warrant Program 2024/2027Subscription of Warrants shall be made at a price corresponding to the market value of the Warrants at the time of subscription. The market value of the Warrants shall be calculated by an independent valuation institute or audit firm according to the Black-Scholes valuation model at each individual time of subscription. Based on a share price of 0.973 SEK  the market value of the Warrants has been preliminarily estimated at 0.17 SEK per Warrant. The total cost of the subsidy  based on an option value of 0.17 SEK  is estimated to be a maximum of 2 364 940 SEK for the entire Warrant Program 2024/2027  including social security costs. The option value has been estimated based on the Black-Scholes valuation model with assumptions of a share price of 0.973 SEK  a risk-free interest rate of 2.6 per cent  and a volatility of 58.0 per cent.The Company will subsidize the participants' acquisition of Warrants. The subsidy shall be paid out at the start of the program and the total cost for the subsidy shall correspond to the premium paid by the participant upon subscription of the Warrants. Such cost will include both salary costs for the subsidy paid and social security contributions which means that the subsidy gross of income tax will be lower than 100 per cent of the premium paid. For a participant with tax residence in Sweden with a tax rate for income from employment of 50 per cent and tax rate for social security contributions of 31.42 per cent  the subsidy net of income tax will correspond to 38 per cent of the warrant premium. Thus  the participant is required to make a substantial private investment to participate.A participant's entitlement to subsidy requires  with certain exceptions  that the participant is employed by the Company at the time of payment of the bonus. Fingerprint reserves the right to invoke a clawback arrangement in the event of a participant's termination of employment prior to the end of the Vesting Period. At such clawback  the participant is obligated to reimburse the Company for the subsidy received. The amount to be repaid upon invocation of the clawback shall correspond linearly to the gross subsidy paid to the participant at the start of the program and the remaining Vesting Period.In addition to the above costs  administrative costs for advisers  etc.  in connection with the preparation of decision documentation and decision-making on the issuance of Warrants will be incurred. The total administrative costs are expected to be marginal in relation to other costs of Warrant Program 2024/2027.If sufficient majority to issue warrants to participants in accordance with item b) below is not obtained  and the Company instead implements a call option program where delivery of shares to participants is secured through a share swap agreement with a third party in accordance with item c) below  costs for such share swap will also be incurred.8. DilutionUpon full exercise of all issued Warrants  Warrant Program 2024/2027 will comprise a maximum of 14 000 000 new shares in Fingerprint  corresponding to a dilution of approximately 2.2 per cent of all outstanding shares in Fingerprint at the time of release of the notice to the Annual General Meeting.The costs of Warrant Program 2024/2027 are expected to have a marginal impact on the Group's key figures.9. Objectives of the proposal and reasons for deviation from the shareholders' pre-emption rightsThe Board of Directors wishes to introduce a long-term incentive program for the Executive Management to encourage personal long-term ownership in the Company and to increase and strengthen the opportunities to recruit  retain  and motivate such individuals. The Board of Directors believes that the introduction of Warrant Program 2024/2027 is beneficial for the Company and the shareholders by providing a competitive and motivational incentive for members of the Executive Management in the Company.Based on this  the Board of Directors believes that the introduction of Warrant Program 2024/2027 will have a positive effect on the Company's continued development  outweighing the costs associated with the program  and thus be beneficial for both shareholders and the Company.b) Proposal for resolution on issuance of WarrantsIn order to implement the Warrant Program 2024/2027 in a cost-effective and flexible manner  the Board of Directors proposes that the Meeting resolves  with deviation from the shareholders´ pre-emption rights  on a directed issue of maximum 14 000 000 Warrants to the participants in Warrant Program 2024/2027 with the right to subscribe for B-shares in the Company as follows:The Warrants are issued at a price equivalent to the market value of the Warrants at the time of subscription. The market value of the Warrants shall be determined by an independent valuation institute or audit firm according to the Black-Scholes valuation model at each individual time of subscription. Based on a share price of 0.973 SEK  the market value of the Warrants has been preliminarily calculated to be 0.17 SEK per Warrant.Each Warrant shall entitle the holder to subscribe for one (1) B-share in the Company  and thus the share capital  upon full exercise  will increase by a maximum of 609 595.093959 SEK.The right to subscribe for the Warrants is granted  deviating from the shareholders’ pre-emption rights to the participants in the Warrants Program 2024/2027. The reasons for deviating from the shareholders' pre-emption rights are that the Company wishes to introduce the proposed incentive program Warrants Program 2024/2027.Subscription on subscription list and payment for the Warrants shall be made no later than July 1  2024. The Board of Directors has the right to extend the subscription and payment period.The Warrants entitle to subscription of B-shares in the Company from July 1  2027  up until October 1  2027.Each Warrant shall entitle the holder to subscribe for one (1) B-share in the Company at a subscription price equivalent to 235 per cent of the volume-weighted average price according to Nasdaq Stockholm's official price list for the Fingerprint B-share during the ten (10) first trading days following the Annual General Meeting on May 28  2024. However  the subscription price may never be less than the share's quota value. Any premium shall be transferred in its entirety to the unrestricted premium reserve.For the Warrants  the other terms and conditions set forth in the full Warrant terms shall apply. As indicated in the full Warrant terms  the subscription price as well as the number of shares to which each Warrant entitles subscription may  in certain cases  be adjusted in connection with bonus issues  mergers or splits of shares  new issues  issues of Warrants or convertible instruments  and in certain other cases. Furthermore  the timing of the exercise of the Warrants may be advanced and/or postponed in certain cases.The newly issued shares shall entitle to dividends for the first time on the record date that occurs closest after the shares have been registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and entered into the share register maintained by Euroclear Sweden AB.The Board of Directors  or the person appointed by the Board of Directors  is proposed to be authorized to make minor adjustments that may prove necessary in connection with the registration of the resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and  where applicable  Euroclear Sweden AB.Considering that the Board of Directors believes that the issuance of Warrants is most cost-effective  it is proposed  in the first instance  that hedging measures regarding Warrant Program 2024/2027 be carried out under this item b).

IntroductionThe Executive Management is defined as the Chief Executive Officer and other members of the management team. The purpose of these guidelines is to clarify the compensation as decided.The guidelines are forward-looking  i.e. they are applicable to remuneration agreed  and amendments to remuneration already agreed  after adoption of the guidelines by the annual general meeting. The general meeting has the right to agree on additional remunerations outside of these guidelines.2. Remuneration CommitteeThe remuneration committee evaluates and considers matters regarding remuneration and employment terms and prepares proposals for guidelines for compensation to the CEO and executive management. The Board of Directors shall evaluate a proposal for new guidelines at least every fourth year and submit it to the AGM. The guidelines shall be in force until new guidelines are adopted by the general meeting. The Remuneration Committee should ensure that remuneration is commensurate with prevailing market conditions for corresponding executives in other companies  and accordingly  that the company’s offering to its employees is competitive. The CEO’s compensation is approved by the Board of Directors. Compensation to other senior executives is decided by the CEO after consulting with the Remuneration Committee. The members of the remuneration committee are independent of the company and its executive management. The CEO and other members of the executive management do not participate in the board of directors’ processing of and resolutions regarding remuneration-related matters in so far as they are affected by such matters.3. Remuneration Principles and the guidelines’ promotion of the company’s business strategy  long-term interests and sustainabilityFingerprint Cards aims to attract  engage  develop and retain the right people to drive our business result in line with the company’s business strategy.

Base salary will depend on the employee’s performance against objectives  development progress and living our company values.Competitive and Sustainable:We must create value to secure our present and future capability to pay competitive compensation and we must earn the means for our compensation. It is important to have a balance between our company earnings and our compensation levels.Market driven:Our salaries shall reflect the scope and complexity of the work. It is our objective to compare our base salaries with relevant market data for the applicable country. Each country forms its own market.The remuneration principles are also applicable to the rest of the employees at Fingerprint Cards.In the preparation of the board of directors’ proposal for these remuneration guidelines  salary and employment terms for employees of the company have been taken into account by including information on the employees’ total income  the components of the remuneration and increase and growth rate over time  in the remuneration committee’s and the board of directors’ basis of decision when evaluating whether the guidelines and the limitations set out herein are reasonable.4.

The Short-Term Incentives include company measures such as Revenue  Operating Profit and Cash Balance. For Executives  80-90 per cent of the STI is based on company measures  and 10-20 per cent is based on individual performance  with predetermined targets on an annual basis. The criteria shall be designed so as to contribute to Fingerprint Card’s business strategy and long-term interests  including its sustainability.The satisfaction of criteria for awarding STI shall be measured over a period of one or several years. The variable cash remuneration may amount to not more than 100 per cent of the total fixed base salary during the measurement period.For financial objectives  the evaluation shall be based on financial information made public by the company.4.2 PensionPension plans are based on defined contribution models  where a premium is paid amounting to not more than 30 per cent of the Executive’s fixed annual base salary.4.3 InsurancesExecutives are provided insurance coverage in accordance with local market practice. Such benefits shall be customary and be of limited amount.4.4 Termination of employmentUpon termination of an employment  the notice period may not exceed six months. During the notice period  the executive will continue to receive full base salary and other employment benefits. Upon termination by the company  severance payment could be paid and may not exceed twelve months’ base salary. When termination is made by the executive  the notice period may not exceed six months  without any right to severance pay.Additionally  remuneration may be paid for non-compete undertakings. Such remuneration  if applicable  shall amount to a maximum of 60 per cent of the monthly base salary at the time of termination of employment  unless otherwise provided by mandatory collective agreement provisions.4.5 The Board of Directors’ right to deviate from the principle of remunerationIn certain cases the Board of Directors may decide to deviate from these guidelines  in part or in total  if there are special reasons to do so in an individual case and a deviation is necessary to fulfill the company’s long term interest  including in relation to sustainability  or to safeguard the company’s financial position.

The acquisitions shall take place on Nasdaq Stockholm and only at a price per share within the share price interval registered at that time  which means the difference between the highest buying price and the lowest selling price. Payment for the shares shall be made in cash.It is also proposed that the Board of Directors be authorized to resolve  on one or several occasions up until the next AGM  to transfer the Company's Class B shares  deviating from the shareholders' preferential rights.

Transfers may be made of no more Class B shares than the number of such shares held by the Company at the time of the Board's decision regarding transfer. Transfers on Nasdaq Stockholm may only be carried out at a price per share within the share price interval registered at that time  which means the difference between the highest buying price and the lowest selling price. If transferred otherwise than on Nasdaq Stockholm  the share price shall be established so that it is not below market terms. However  a discount to the stock market price may apply  in line with market practice.The purpose of the authorizations is to promote efficient capital usage in the Company and to create flexibility in the Company's ability to seize attractive business opportunities by wholly or partly financing acquisitions of companies or business operations through the transfer of own shares.Item 18 – Board of Directors' proposal regarding authorization of the Board to decide on the issue of new shares with or without preferential rights for the shareholdersa) authorization of 20 per centThe Board of Directors proposes that the Meeting authorizes the Board to resolve  on one or several occasions up until the next AGM  with or without deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  on new issues of Class B shares  warrants and/or convertibles entitling to subscription of Class B shares  corresponding to no more than twenty (20) per cent of the total number of outstanding shares in the Company on the day of publication of this notice.

Background and summaryThe purpose of the proposal is to attract and retain talent over time  increase engagement and performance  and encourage personal long-term ownership in the Company. The Board of Directors believes it is in the interest of all shareholders that individuals deemed important for the Company's development  have a long-term interest in the Company's value development. The proposed program creates long-term ownership engagement  which is expected to stimulate increased interest in the business and its performance over the entire period. The Board of Directors’ intention is to propose similar programs annually to the Annual General Meeting  where the size of the program will be evaluated continuously to ensure a long-term sustainable incentive program.Warrant Program 2024/2027 means that members of the Executive Management are offered to purchase warrants at market price (""Warrants"") which each entitle the holder  after approximately three years  to subscribe for one B-share in Fingerprint. To assist participants with the initial investment  a cash bonus will be paid out to participants from Fingerprint. The payment of the subsidy will be cashflow neutral to the company and partly subsidize the participants investment. The Company has the right to invoke a clawback if a participant terminates its employment with the company within three years.Based on the terms set forth below  the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting resolves on the implementation of Warrant Program 2024/2027  as well as the issuance of Warrants to the Executive Management of Fingerprint.2. Participant categoriesThe right to subscribe for warrants shall be granted to a maximum of eleven senior executives  including the CEO  who have entered into repurchase agreements with the Company. Participants are divided into different categories based on their respective roles in the Company. The distribution of Warrants are as follows:Category 1 consists of the Chief Executive Officer (one participant) with the right to subscribe for a maximum of 5 000 000 Warrants.Category 2 consists of up to ten members of the Executive Management with the right to collectively subscribe for a maximum of 9 000 000 Warrants  whereby each participant can subscribe for a maximum of 2 500 000 Warrants.Over-subscription is not possible. In case of under-subscription  Warrants not subscribed for by any participant shall lapse.3. AllocationDecisions on participation or introduction of Warrant Program 2024/2027 require  according to the Board of Directors’ assessment  that it can be offered at reasonable administrative costs and financial effects.Warrant Program 2024/2027 may include a maximum of 14 000 000 Warrants.The Warrants can be exercised for B-shares in the Company from July 1  2027 up until October 1  2027. The period until this date constitutes the ""Vesting Period”.4.Vesting Period and exercise PriceThe Vesting Period for the Warrants shall be a maximum of three years and four months from their issuance  and the exercise period shall be from July 1  2027 up until October 1  2027.The exercise price upon the participant's exercise of the Warrants shall correspond to 235 per cent of the volume-weighted average price according to Nasdaq Stockholm's official price list for the Fingerprint B-share during the first ten (10) trading days following the Annual General Meeting on May 28  2024. The exercise of the Warrants may be made through net settlement.5. Other terms for the WarrantsIn addition to the above  the following terms shall apply to the Warrants:Participants may not transfer  pledge  or dispose of the Warrants or exercise any rights regarding the Warrants during the Vesting Period.The participant's right to subscribe for Warrants is conditioned upon (i) the participant not having resigned or been terminated from their employment with the Company at the time of subscription  (ii) subscription of Warrants being legally possible and  according to the Board of Directors’ assessment  feasible with reasonable administrative and economic efforts  and (iii) the participant and/or  if applicable  their company  having entered into a special agreement with the Company  under which the Company  or the Company designates  among other things  has the right to repurchase the Warrants from the participant/company if the participant's employment terminates and in certain other situations  at an amount equal to the market value of the Warrants and  if applicable  the lower of the market value and acquisition value of the Warrants. The Board of Directors shall have the right to make minor adjustments to the terms of the agreement deemed appropriate or necessary due to labor law or tax law regulations or administrative conditions.6. Detailed terms and administrationThe Board of Directors  through the Remuneration Committee  is responsible for the detailed design and administration of Warrant Program 2024/2027  within the framework of the terms and guidelines provided by the Annual General Meeting. For example  the Board of Directors may decide that no allocation of Warrants shall be made to a participant  despite the conditions under point 5 above being met  in cases of fraud  other criminal activities  or when a participant has acted grossly negligent.Certain deviations from or adjustments to the terms of Warrant Program 2024/2027 may be made due to local regulations and prevailing market practices or market conditions  including cash settlement instead of delivery of shares to participants under certain conditions.7. Value of and estimated costs for Warrant Program 2024/2027Subscription of Warrants shall be made at a price corresponding to the market value of the Warrants at the time of subscription. The market value of the Warrants shall be calculated by an independent valuation institute or audit firm according to the Black-Scholes valuation model at each individual time of subscription. Based on a share price of 0.973 SEK  the market value of the Warrants has been preliminarily estimated at 0.17 SEK per Warrant. The total cost of the subsidy  based on an option value of 0.17 SEK  is estimated to be a maximum of 2 364 940 SEK for the entire Warrant Program 2024/2027  including social security costs. The option value has been estimated based on the Black-Scholes valuation model with assumptions of a share price of 0.973 SEK  a risk-free interest rate of 2.6 per cent  and a volatility of 58.0 per cent.The Company will subsidize the participants' acquisition of Warrants. The subsidy shall be paid out at the start of the program and the total cost for the subsidy shall correspond to the premium paid by the participant upon subscription of the Warrants. Such cost will include both salary costs for the subsidy paid and social security contributions which means that the subsidy gross of income tax will be lower than 100 per cent of the premium paid. For a participant with tax residence in Sweden with a tax rate for income from employment of 50 per cent and tax rate for social security contributions of 31.42 per cent  the subsidy net of income tax will correspond to 38 per cent of the warrant premium. Thus  the participant is required to make a substantial private investment to participate.A participant's entitlement to subsidy requires  with certain exceptions  that the participant is employed by the Company at the time of payment of the bonus. Fingerprint reserves the right to invoke a clawback arrangement in the event of a participant's termination of employment prior to the end of the Vesting Period. At such clawback  the participant is obligated to reimburse the Company for the subsidy received. The amount to be repaid upon invocation of the clawback shall correspond linearly to the gross subsidy paid to the participant at the start of the program and the remaining Vesting Period.In addition to the above costs  administrative costs for advisers  etc.  in connection with the preparation of decision documentation and decision-making on the issuance of Warrants will be incurred. The total administrative costs are expected to be marginal in relation to other costs of Warrant Program 2024/2027.If sufficient majority to issue warrants to participants in accordance with item b) below is not obtained  and the Company instead implements a call option program where delivery of shares to participants is secured through a share swap agreement with a third party in accordance with item c) below  costs for such share swap will also be incurred.8. DilutionUpon full exercise of all issued Warrants  Warrant Program 2024/2027 will comprise a maximum of 14 000 000 new shares in Fingerprint  corresponding to a dilution of approximately 2.2 per cent of all outstanding shares in Fingerprint at the time of release of the notice to the Annual General Meeting.The costs of Warrant Program 2024/2027 are expected to have a marginal impact on the Group's key figures.9. Objectives of the proposal and reasons for deviation from the shareholders' pre-emption rightsThe Board of Directors wishes to introduce a long-term incentive program for the Executive Management to encourage personal long-term ownership in the Company and to increase and strengthen the opportunities to recruit  retain  and motivate such individuals. The Board of Directors believes that the introduction of Warrant Program 2024/2027 is beneficial for the Company and the shareholders by providing a competitive and motivational incentive for members of the Executive Management in the Company.Based on this  the Board of Directors believes that the introduction of Warrant Program 2024/2027 will have a positive effect on the Company's continued development  outweighing the costs associated with the program  and thus be beneficial for both shareholders and the Company.b) Proposal for resolution on issuance of WarrantsIn order to implement the Warrant Program 2024/2027 in a cost-effective and flexible manner  the Board of Directors proposes that the Meeting resolves  with deviation from the shareholders´ pre-emption rights  on a directed issue of maximum 14 000 000 Warrants to the participants in Warrant Program 2024/2027 with the right to subscribe for B-shares in the Company as follows:The Warrants are issued at a price equivalent to the market value of the Warrants at the time of subscription. The market value of the Warrants shall be determined by an independent valuation institute or audit firm according to the Black-Scholes valuation model at each individual time of subscription. Based on a share price of 0.973 SEK  the market value of the Warrants has been preliminarily calculated to be 0.17 SEK per Warrant.Each Warrant shall entitle the holder to subscribe for one (1) B-share in the Company  and thus the share capital  upon full exercise  will increase by a maximum of 609 595.093959 SEK.The right to subscribe for the Warrants is granted  deviating from the shareholders’ pre-emption rights to the participants in the Warrants Program 2024/2027. The reasons for deviating from the shareholders' pre-emption rights are that the Company wishes to introduce the proposed incentive program Warrants Program 2024/2027.Subscription on subscription list and payment for the Warrants shall be made no later than July 1  2024. The Board of Directors has the right to extend the subscription and payment period.The Warrants entitle to subscription of B-shares in the Company from July 1  2027  up until October 1  2027.Each Warrant shall entitle the holder to subscribe for one (1) B-share in the Company at a subscription price equivalent to 235 per cent of the volume-weighted average price according to Nasdaq Stockholm's official price list for the Fingerprint B-share during the ten (10) first trading days following the Annual General Meeting on May 28  2024. However  the subscription price may never be less than the share's quota value. Any premium shall be transferred in its entirety to the unrestricted premium reserve.For the Warrants  the other terms and conditions set forth in the full Warrant terms shall apply. As indicated in the full Warrant terms  the subscription price as well as the number of shares to which each Warrant entitles subscription may  in certain cases  be adjusted in connection with bonus issues  mergers or splits of shares  new issues  issues of Warrants or convertible instruments  and in certain other cases. Furthermore  the timing of the exercise of the Warrants may be advanced and/or postponed in certain cases.The newly issued shares shall entitle to dividends for the first time on the record date that occurs closest after the shares have been registered with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and entered into the share register maintained by Euroclear Sweden AB.The Board of Directors  or the person appointed by the Board of Directors  is proposed to be authorized to make minor adjustments that may prove necessary in connection with the registration of the resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office and  where applicable  Euroclear Sweden AB.Considering that the Board of Directors believes that the issuance of Warrants is most cost-effective  it is proposed  in the first instance  that hedging measures regarding Warrant Program 2024/2027 be carried out under this item b). If the required majority cannot be obtained for the proposal under this item b)  the Company proposes to enter into a share swap agreement under item c) below.c) Hedging measures regarding Warrant Program 2024/2027 in the form of share swapIf the required majority for the resolution on the issuance of Warrants under item b) above cannot be achieved  the Board of Directors may ensure that the Company instead issues call options (""Call Options"") and secures the delivery of shares expected to result from Warrant Program 2024/2027 by entering into a share swap agreement with a third party  whereby the third party  in its own name  shall acquire and transfer shares in the Company to the participants in Warrant Program 2024/2027. The relevant number of Fingerprint shares shall correspond to the Warrants proposed under item a) above. The provisions regarding the terms of Warrants shall then apply to Call Options issued in accordance with this item c).Preparation of the proposalThe proposal has been prepared by the Remuneration Committee in consultation with the Board of Directors and external advisors.

The ""two largest shareholders"" refer to the ownership grouped registered or in any other way known shareholders as per the end of September. If any of these two largest shareholders refrain from appointing an owner representative  or if an owner representative resigns or relinquishes the position before the assignment is completed and the entitled shareholder does not appoint another representative  the chairman of the board of directors shall invite the next shareholder (i.e. first the third largest owner) to within a week of the request appoint an owner representative. The procedure shall continue until the Nomination Committee is composed of three members.If a substantial change of ownership occurs no later than seven weeks before the annual shareholders' meeting  a new shareholder representative shall be appointed. The chairman of the board of directors shall then contact the one of the two largest shareholders without an owner representative and request such shareholder to appoint a representative. When such a representative has been appointed  such representative shall be a member of the Nomination Committee and replace the former member of the Nomination Committee who no longer represents one of the two largest shareholders.The Nomination Committee's term shall run until such time as a new Nomination Committee has been elected.Item 12: Resolution on remuneration of the Nomination Committee for work ahead of the annual shareholders' meeting in 2025The Nomination Committee proposes that remuneration should be paid to the members of the Nomination Committee for the work up and until the annual shareholders' meeting to be held in 2025 with SEK 30 000 to each member  who is not also a board member.Item 13: Resolution on approval of remuneration reportThe board of directors proposes that the annual shareholders' meeting resolves to approve the board of directors' remuneration report for the financial year 2023.Item 14: Resolution on guidelines for remuneration to senior executivesThe board of directors proposes  with amendments to the guidelines adopted by the annual shareholders' meeting 2023  that the annual shareholders' meeting resolves to adopt the following guidelines for remuneration to senior executives.Scope and applicability of the guidelinesThese guidelines comprise the persons who are part of Saniona's group management (including the CEO). The guidelines also encompass any remuneration to members of the board of directors  in addition to board remuneration.These guidelines are applicable to remuneration agreed  and amendments to remuneration already agreed  after adoption of the guidelines by the annual shareholders' meeting 2024. These guidelines do not apply to any remuneration resolved by the shareholders' meeting  such as e.g. board remuneration and share-based incentive programs.The guidelines' promotion of the company's business strategy  long-term interests and sustainabilitySaniona is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of medicines modulating ion channels. In short  Saniona's business strategy includes proprietary development of product candidates for the treatment of epilepsy and other diseases of the central nervous system where there are large unmet medical needs  with the goal of obtaining market approval in the US and Europe. For more information about Saniona's business strategy  see Saniona's latest annual report.A successful implementation of Saniona's business strategy and safeguarding of Saniona's long-term interests  including its sustainability  require that the company is able to recruit and retain highly competent senior executives with a capacity to achieve set goals. In order to achieve this  Saniona must offer a competitive total remuneration on market terms  which these guidelines enable.Long-term share-based incentive programs have been implemented in Saniona. For further information about these programs  see Saniona's latest annual report. The share-based incentive programs have been approved by the shareholders' meeting and are therefore not covered by these guidelines.Types of remuneration  etc.The remuneration shall be on market terms and be competitive and may consist of the following components: fixed salary  variable cash remuneration  pension benefits and other benefits. For the individual senior executive  the level of remuneration shall be based on factors such as work duties  expertise  position  responsibilities and performances. Additionally  the shareholders' meeting may - irrespective of these guidelines - resolve on  e.g. share and share price-related remuneration.For employments governed by rules other than Swedish  pension benefits and other benefits may be duly adjusted for compliance with mandatory rules or established local practice  considering  to the extent possible  the overall purpose of these guidelines.Fixed salaryThe CEO and other senior executives shall be offered a fixed annual cash salary. The fixed cash salary shall as a starting point be determined per calendar year with salary revision on an annual basis.Variable cash remunerationIn addition to fixed salary  the CEO and other senior executives may  according to separate agreements  receive variable cash remuneration. Variable cash remuneration covered by these guidelines is intended to promote Saniona's business strategy and long-term interests  including its sustainability.The satisfaction of criteria for awarding variable cash remuneration shall be measured over a period of one year. Any variable cash remuneration may not exceed 50 per cent of the fixed annual cash salary. Variable cash remuneration shall not qualify for pension benefits  save as required by mandatory collective bargaining agreements.The variable cash remuneration shall be linked to one or several predetermined and measurable criteria  which can be financial  such as completing a financing of a specified amount by a specified time  or non-financial  such as successful completion of a development activity such as a clinical trial by a specified date. At least 20 per cent of the variable cash remuneration shall depend on financial criteria. By linking the goals in a clear and measurable way to the remuneration of the senior executives to Saniona's financial and operational development  they contribute to the implementation of the company's business strategy  long-term interests and sustainability.To which extent the criteria for awarding variable cash remuneration has been satisfied shall be evaluated and determined when the measurement period has ended. The Remuneration Committee is responsible for the evaluation. For financial objectives  the evaluation shall be based on the latest financial information made public by the company.Additional variable cash remuneration may be awarded in extraordinary circumstances  provided that such extraordinary arrangements are only made on an individual basis  either for the purpose of recruiting or retaining senior executives  or as remuneration for extraordinary performance beyond the individual's ordinary tasks. Such remuneration may not exceed an amount corresponding to 100 per cent of the fixed annual cash salary and may not be paid more than once each year per individual. Any resolution on such remuneration shall be made by the board of directors based on a proposal from the Remuneration Committee.The board of directors shall have the possibility to  in whole or in part  reclaim variable cash remuneration paid on incorrect grounds.Pension benefitsPension benefits  including health insurance  shall be defined contribution  insofar as the senior executive is not covered by defined benefit pension under mandatory collective bargaining agreements. Pension premiums for defined contribution pensions  including health insurance  may amount to a maximum of 15 per cent of the fixed annual cash salary.Other benefitsOther benefits may include life insurance  medical insurance and a company car. Premiums and other costs relating to such benefits may amount to a total of not more than 20 per cent of the fixed annual cash salary.Termination of employment and severance paymentSenior executives shall be employed until further notice or for a specified period of time. Upon termination of an employment by Saniona  the notice period may not exceed 12 months. Fixed cash salary during the notice period and severance pay may not together exceed an amount corresponding to the fixed monthly cash salary for 12 months. Upon termination by the senior executive  the notice period may not exceed six months  without any right to severance pay.In addition to fixed cash salary during the period of notice and severance pay  additional remuneration may be paid for non-compete undertakings. Such remuneration shall compensate for loss of income and shall only be paid in so far as the previously employed senior executive is not entitled to severance pay for the period for which the non-compete undertaking applies. The remuneration shall be based on the fixed annual cash salary at the time of termination of employment and amount to not more than 60 per cent of the fixed annual cash salary at the time of termination of employment  save as otherwise provided by mandatory collective bargaining agreements  and shall be paid during the time as the non-compete undertaking applies  however not for more than 12 months following termination of employment.Salary and employment conditions for employeesIn the preparation of the board of directors' proposal for these remuneration guidelines  salary and employment conditions for employees of Saniona have been taken into consideration by including information on the employees' total income  the components of the remuneration and increase and growth rate over time  in the Remuneration Committee's and the board of directors' basis of decision when evaluating whether the guidelines and the limitations set out herein are reasonable.Consultancy fees to the members of the board of directorsTo the extent a member of the board of directors renders services for the company  in addition to his or her assignment as a member of the board of directors  an additional consultancy fee on market terms may be paid to the member of the board of directors  or to a company controlled by such member of the board of directors  provided that such services contribute to the implementation of Saniona's business strategy and the safeguarding of Saniona's long-term interests  including its sustainability.Preparation and decision-making progressThe board of directors has established a Remuneration Committee. The Remuneration Committee's duties include i.a. preparing the board of directors' resolution to propose guidelines for remuneration to senior executives. The board of directors shall prepare a proposal for new guidelines at least every fourth year and submit it to the shareholders' meeting. The guidelines shall be in force until new guidelines have been adopted by the shareholders' meeting. The Remuneration Committee shall also monitor and evaluate programs for variable remuneration for the senior executives as well as the current remuneration structures and compensation levels in the company. The members of the Remuneration Committee are independent in relation to the company and its senior management. The CEO and other members of the senior management do not participate in the board of directors' processing of and resolutions regarding remuneration-related matters in so far as they are affected by such matters.Deviation from these guidelinesThe board of directors may temporarily resolve to deviate from these guidelines  in whole or in part  if in a specific case there is special cause for the deviation and a deviation is necessary to serve the company's long-term interests  including its sustainability  or to ensure the company's financial viability. As set out above  the Remuneration Committee's tasks include preparing the board of directors' resolutions in remuneration-related matters  which include any resolutions to deviate from these guidelines.Review of the guidelinesThe board of directors' proposal on guidelines for remuneration to senior executives corresponds  in all material respects  to existing guidelines  except that fixed cash salary during the notice period and severance pay may not together exceed an amount corresponding to the fixed monthly cash salary for 12 months (previously 24 months).Item 15: Resolution on authorization for the board of directors regarding issuesThe board of directors proposes that the annual shareholders' meeting resolves to authorize the board of directors  within the limits of the company's Articles of Association  at one or several occasions  during the time up until the next annual shareholders' meeting  with or without deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  to resolve to issue new shares  warrants and/or convertibles. An issue should be able to be made with or without provisions regarding contribution in kind  set-off or other conditions. The total number of shares that may be issued (alternatively be issued through conversion of convertibles and/or exercise of warrants) shall not exceed 111 238 252  which corresponds to a dilution of 50 per cent calculated on current number of shares in the company. In case the authorization is used for an issue with deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  the issue should be made on market terms. The purpose of the authorization is to be able to source working capital  to be able to execute and finance acquisitions of companies and assets as well as to enable new issues to industrial partners within the framework of partnerships and alliances.The company's CEO shall be authorized to make such minor formal adjustments of the resolution as might be necessary in connection with registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office (Sw. Bolagsverket).Item 16: Resolution on (A) employee option program; and (B) directed issue of warrants and approval of transfer of warrantsThe board of directors proposes that the annual shareholders' meeting resolves to adopt an employee option program for the CEO  other senior executives and other employees in accordance with what is set out under A below.The purpose of the proposed employee option program (the ""Employee Option Program 2024"") is to secure a long-term commitment for employees through a compensation system which is linked to the company's future value growth. Through the implementation of a share-based incentive program  the future value growth in the company is encouraged  which implies common interests and goals for the shareholders of the company and the participants. Such share-based incentive program is also expected to increase the company's possibilities to retain competent persons. Further details of the Employee Option Program 2024 are set out under Section A below.In order to secure the company's undertakings under the Employee Option Program 2024  the board of directors also proposes that the annual shareholders' meeting resolves on a directed issue of warrants and an approval of transfer of warrants in accordance with Section B below.A. The board of directors' proposal on implementation of Employee Option Program 2024The board of directors proposes that the annual shareholders' meeting resolves to implement the Employee Option Program 2024 in accordance with the following substantial guidelines:1. The Employee Option Program 2024 shall comprise a maximum of 3 045 000 employee options.2. Each employee option entitles the holders a right to acquire one new share in the company against cash consideration at an exercise price amounting to 130 per cent of the volume weighted average share price of the company's share on Nasdaq Stockholm during the 10 trading days immediately after the annual shareholders' meeting on 29 May 2024  however not less than SEK 2.678. The thus calculated exercise price shall be rounded to the nearest whole öre  whereupon 0.5 öre shall be rounded upwards. The exercise price can however not be lower than the share's quotient value. The exercise price and the number of shares that each option entitles right to may be subject to recalculation in the event of a bonus issue  split  rights issue etc.  wherein the recalculation terms in the complete terms and conditions of the warrants shall be applied.3. The Employee Option Program 2024 shall comprise the CEO  other senior executives and other employees. The board of directors shall resolve the number of employee options to be allotted to each participant in Employee Option Program 2024  whereby participants in each category listed below can be alloted up to the maximum number of employee options listed below:Participant category Maximum number of employee options CEO Up to 1 855 000 options Senior executives (4 persons) Up to 200 000 options per participant Directors (5 persons) Up to 40 000 options per participant Scientists (6 persons) Up to 20 000 options per participant Other employees (approximately 14 persons) Up to 5 000 options per participant4. Allotment shall take place no later than 31 December 2024.5. The allotted employee options will vest with 1/3 each on the date that falls 12  24 and 36 months  respectively  following the date of allotment. If the number of allotted employee options is not evenly divisible with 1/3  the number of vested employee options shall be rounded downwards to the nearest whole number and any excess employee options shall be considered vested on the last vesting date.6. Vesting is conditional upon that the participant continues to be employed within the Saniona group (the ""Group"") and has not terminated the employment as of the date when the respective vesting occurs. If the participant ceases to be employed or terminates its employment within the Group before a vesting date  the already vested employee options may be exercised on the ordinary date of exercise in accordance with the below  but further vesting will not occur. However  if the participant's employment is terminated due to dismissal or due to personal reasons/breach of contract  vested employee options shall also lapse.7. The employee options shall not constitute securities and shall not be possible to transfer or pledge. However  in the event of death  the rights to vested employee options shall accrue to the beneficiaries of the holder of the employee options.8. The employee options shall be allotted without consideration.9. The holders can exercise allotted and vested employee options during the period starting on the date that falls 3 years after the allotment date and ending on 31 December 2029. The board of directors has the right to limit the number of occasions during the exercise period when the employee options can be exercised.10. In the event of a public take-over offer  asset sale  liquidation  merger or any other such transaction affecting the company  the employee options will vest in their entirety and be exercisable in connection with the relevant transaction.11. Participation in Employee Option Program 2024 is conditional upon that such participation can legally take place  and that such participation in the company's assessment can take place with reasonable administrative costs and financial efforts.12. The employee options shall be governed by separate agreements with the participants. The board of directors shall be responsible for the preparation and management of Employee Option Program 2024 in accordance with the above-mentioned substantial terms and guidelines.B. Proposal on resolution on directed issue of warrants and approval of transfer of warrantsIn order to enable the company's delivery of shares under the Employee Option Program 2024  the board of directors proposes that the annual shareholders' meeting resolves on a directed issue of warrants and approval of transfer of warrants. The board of directors thus proposes that the annual shareholders' meeting resolves on a directed issue of warrants in accordance with the following terms and conditions:1. A maximum of 3 045 000 warrants shall be issued.2. With deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights  the warrants may only be subscribed for by the company or a subsidiary in the Group. The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights is that the warrants are issued as part of the implementation of the Employee Option Program 2024. In the light of what has been stated above  the board of directors considers that it is for the benefit of the company and its shareholders that employees are offered to participate in the Employee Option Program 2024.3. Subscription shall be made no later than 30 November 2024.4. Over subscription cannot occur.5. The warrants shall be issued without consideration. The reason hereof is due to that the warrants shall be issued as part of the implementation of the Employee Option Program 2024.6. Each warrant entitles to subscription of one share in the company at a subscription price amounting to 130 per cent of the volume weighted average share price of the company's share on Nasdaq Stockholm during the 10 trading days immediately after the annual shareholders' meeting on 29 May 2024  however not less than SEK 2.678. The thus calculated subscription price shall be rounded to the nearest whole öre  whereupon 0.5 öre shall be rounded upwards. The subscription price can however not be lower than the share's quotient value and the part of the subscription price exceeding the share's quotient value shall be added to the free share premium reserve. Subscription of shares by virtue of the warrants may be made from registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office up to and including 31 December 2029.7. The subscription price and the number of shares that each warrant entitles right to subscribe for are subject to customary recalculation in the event of a split-up or consolidation of shares  rights issue etc.8. The shares issued upon utilization of a warrant shall confer right to dividends the first time on the record date for dividends that occurs immediately following effectuation of subscription to such extent that the share has been recorded in the company's share ledger as interim share.9. If all warrants are exercised for subscription of new shares  the share capital will increase with SEK 152 250.10. The chairman of the company's board of directors shall be entitled to make such minor adjustments of the issue resolution that might be necessary in connection with registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office.Further  the board of directors proposes that the annual shareholders' meeting shall resolve to approve that the company or another company in the Group  may transfer warrants to the participants in the Employee Option Program 2024 (or to a financial intermediary assisting with the delivery of shares to participants in Employee Option Program 2024) without consideration in connection with the exercise of employee options in accordance with the terms and conditions under Section A above.Other information regarding the Employee Option Program 2024The Employee Option Program 2024 will be accounted for in accordance with ""IFRS 2 - Share based payments"". IFRS 2 stipulates that the options shall be expensed as personnel costs over the vesting period and will be accounted for directly against equity. Personnel costs in accordance with IFRS 2 do not affect the company's cash flow. The board of directors has made the assessment that the Employee Option Program 2024 will not trigger any social costs for the company.The employee options do not have a market value since they are not transferable. However  the board of directors has calculated a theoretical value of the employee options using the ""Black Scholes"" formula. Assuming that all options are allotted and assuming a share price at the time of allotment of the options of SEK 1.80  a strike price of SEK 2.34  a volatility of 71 per cent  a risk free interest of 2.5 per cent and that 100 per cent of the employee options are vested  the value of an employee option has been calculated to SEK 0.81 and the total personnel cost for the Employee Option Program 2024 in accordance with IFRS 2 is estimated to be approximately SEK 2.4 million before tax during the period 2024-2027. Under the same conditions  but assuming that only 50 per cent of the employee options are vested  the total personnel cost for the Employee Option Program 2024 in accordance with IFRS 2 is estimated to approximately SEK 1.2 million before tax during the same period.It shall be noted that the calculations are based on preliminary assumptions and are only intended to provide an illustration of the outcome.As per the date of the notice to the annual shareholders' meeting  the number of shares in the company amounts to 111 238 252.In case all warrants issued in relation to Employee Option Program 2024 are exercised for subscription of new shares  a total of 3 045 000 new shares will be issued  which corresponds to a dilution of approximately 2.66 per cent of the company's share capital and votes after full dilution  calculated on the number of shares that will be added upon full exercise of all warrants issued in relation to Employee Option Program 2024. The dilution would only have had a marginal impact on the key figure earnings per share for the full year 2023.The company currently has several outstanding option programs. For a description of these programs  please see note 12 in the annual report for 2023. As of the date of this notice  options entitling to subscription of in the aggregate 4 581 729 new shares are outstanding in the previous programs.In case all warrants issued in relation to Employee Option Program 2024 as well as all warrants issued in relation to options in existing incentive programs that can still be exercised are exercised for subscription of new shares  a total of 7 626 729 new shares will be issued  which corresponds to a dilution of approximately 6.42 per cent of the company's share capital and votes after full dilution  calculated on the number of shares that will be added upon full exercise of all outstanding and proposed warrants.The above calculations regarding dilution do not take into account the shares that may be issued upon exercise of the warrants series TO 4 that were issued within the framework of the rights issue that was completed in early 2024. The above calculations regarding dilution and impact on key ratios are furthermore subject to recalculation of the warrants in accordance with the customary recalculation terms set out in the complete terms and conditions for the warrants.This proposal has been prepared by the board of directors and its Remuneration Committee in consultation with external advisers.Particular majority requirementsFor a valid resolution on the proposal pursuant to item 15  the proposal has to be supported by shareholders representing at least two-thirds of the votes cast as well as of all shares represented at the annual shareholders' meeting.

OCI's facility has the capacity to produce up to 300 000 tonnes a year of AdBlue® today  with capability to expand production in line with market demand.AdBlue® is a mixture of urea and demineralized water that is injected into vehicle exhaust systems  where it reacts with harmful emissions and converts these into harmless nitrogen and water vapor. The benefits of using AdBlue® include compliance with emissions regulations  improved air quality and potentially higher fuel efficiency.OCI's AdBlue® production will serve the growing North-Western European automotive market  where the reduction of harmful emissions is an increasing regulatory focus and key driver of demand. The introduction of the 'Euro 6 Standard'  which limits emissions to 80mg/km of NOX gases for diesel vehicles is expected to boost the AdBlue® market by 8% by 2028.OCI is a significant producer of urea - the key ingredient in AdBlue® - at its facilities in Geleen  Netherlands. To date  OCI's urea has primarily been used to produce fertilizer. With the introduction of AdBlue® to its already extensive product portfolio  OCI is expanding its end use markets to include the automotive industry.OCI Nitrogen Europe is a leading integrated European producer of premium nitrogen products  including CAN  CAN+S and low carbon CAN with capacity to produce up to 2.6 million metric tons per year. Serving the high-demand agricultural  industrial products and transportation sectors  it is the second largest European CAN/UAN producer and the largest melamine producer globally (excluding China).

Through a seamless connection of its design and simulation data in the cloud  Peugeot Sport was able to evaluate and optimize design ideas. Therefore  final design decisions were reached more efficiently and cost-effectively.“Dassault Systèmes and its technology and expertise are at the center of our design and simulation. This partnership enabled our team of 120 people to collaborate  innovate quickly  and fulfill our objectives ” said Olivier Jansonnie  Motorsport WEC Project Director  Stellantis. “From day one  we could easily access and understand the airflow simulation results and make the first decisions that steered the rest of our designs. We were able to achieve 80 to 90% of our development only with simulation.”Peugeot Sport’s PEUGEOT 9X8 Hybrid Hypercar will participate in the 2024 FIA World Endurance Championship (WEC) season  which consists of nine races globally including the high-profile 24 Hours of Le Mans. In the hybrid hypercar category  competitors must adhere to strict design regulations and test their vehicles in the same wind tunnel  underscoring the key role of aerodynamics in gaining a competitive edge.Peugeot Sport was already using Dassault Systèmes’ CATIA applications for its mechanical design  and wanted to get its aerodynamics studies up and running quickly and carry out its testing in one virtual approach  before testing the physical car in the tunnel. More than 10 000 simulations were run using Dassault Systèmes’ solutions  evaluating how air would flow underneath the powertrain  around the front splitter  and along the rear without a wing  for example.“Motorsports is demanding for drivers and their vehicles. It requires teams to have speed and precision ” said Laurence Montanari  Vice President  Transportation & Mobility Industry  Dassault Systèmes. “Dassault Systèmes has created an environment on the cloud for the engineers of our two companies to collaborate.

Key target indications for the autoimmune platform include graft-versus-host-disease (GvHD)  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  and now systemic sclerosis (SSc).Following the merger in October 2022  BioSenic combined the strategic positionings and strengths of Medsenic and Bone Therapeutics. The merger specifically enables Medsenic/Biosenic to develop an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/oral ATO (OATO).BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About the main Medsenic/BioSenic technology platformThe ATO platform provides derived active products with immunomodulatory properties and fundamental effects on the activated cells of the immune system. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. cGvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT).Medsenic has been successful in a phase 2 trial with its intravenous formulation  Arscimed®  which has orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA. The company is heading towards an international phase 3 confirmatory study  with its new  IP-protected  OATO formulation. Another selected target is moderate-to-severe forms of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae  and the gastrointestinal tract). Systemic sclerosis is now full part of the clinical pipeline of Medsenic/BioSenic. This serious chronic disease badly affects skin  lungs  or vascularization  and has no current effective treatment. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive  giving good grounds to launch a phase 2 clinical protocol  using new immunomodulatory formulations of APIs recognized to be active on the immune system.The company is currently focusing its present R&D and clinical activities on a selective  accelerated development of its autoimmune platform.Note: The allogeneic cell therapy platform-originating from the previous listed company Bone Therapeutics company  may be of renewed interest by using isolated and purified differentiated bone marrow Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) as a starting material for further isolation of passive or active biological subcellular elements. Indeed  these cells may provide new subcellular vesicles potentially able to deliver a unique and proprietary approach to organ repair. BioSenic is now involved in determining new patentable approaches in this complex area of cell therapy.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAFrançois Rieger  PhD  CEOTel: +33 (0)671 73 31 59investorrelations@biosenic.comCertain statements  beliefs and opinions in this press release are forward-looking  which reflect the company or  as appropriate  the company directors’ current expectations and projections about future events.

CARBIOS (Euronext Growth Paris: ALCRB)  a pioneer in the development and industrialization of biological technologies to reinvent the life cycle of plastic and textiles  today celebrated the groundbreaking ceremony for the world's first PET biorecycling plant in the presence of representatives of local authorities  partner brands and industrial partners who all make up CARBIOS’ ecosystem. Located in Longlaville  in the Grand-Est region of France  CARBIOS' first commercial plant will play a key role in the fight against plastic pollution  offering an industrial-scale solution for the enzymatic depolymerization of PET waste in order to accelerate a circular economy for plastic and textiles. The plant will have a processing capacity of 50kt/year of prepared waste when operating at full capacity. Work is progressing on schedule with significant quantities delivered to customers in 2026.PET  the second most widely used plastic in the world  is mainly manufactured from oil. Thanks to CARBIOS’ enzymatic biorecycling technology  PET will no longer be made from oil  but from its own waste. This technological breakthrough opens up new recycling streams for multilayered  coloured and opaque trays made from packaging waste and polyester textile waste  which until now have been little or not recycled at all  giving them value. In addition  this breakthrough positions France as a pioneer in green innovation  contributing to its reindustrialisation and leadership in the transition to a sustainable economy.In a LinkedIn post published on 24 April 2024  Emmanuel Macron  President of France  said: “A technological revolution is taking shape tomorrow with the groundbreaking ceremony of CARBIOS’ plant in Longlaville: the world's first biorecycling plant. French pride! Ecological transition and growth  made in France and innovation go hand in hand.”Christophe Béchu  Minister for Ecological Transition and Territorial Cohesion: “At a time when governments are negotiating an international treaty against plastic pollution in Ottowa  the groundbreaking of CARBIOS’ biorecycling plant is particularly significant. It illustrates France's commitment to the ecological transition  and demonstrates our ability to turn challenges into opportunities for a more sustainable future. This plant  a world first  embodies French innovation in responding to complex environmental challenges  offering a sustainable solution for a future where plastic and textile waste will be transformed into valuable resources for a truly circular economy.”Roland Lescure  Minister Delegate in charge of Industry: “This inauguration is emblematic of the green industrial revolution that we have been implementing for the past year: French technology that is sustainable  innovative and creates jobs. It is also emblematic of the method I am applying with all industrial sectors: the ecology of the contract. With the financial and administrative support of the French government  the new CARBIOS plant in Longlaville will remove a major technological barrier to the development of the textile recycling industry in France.”Franck Leroy  President of Région Grand-Est : « I'm proud to support the deployment of the world's first plant dedicated to the biorecycling of PET. CARBIOS is a perfect illustration of our vision of modern  responsible re-industrialisation  placing the Grand Est region at the heart of the ecological transition. This key innovation in the fight against plastic pollution will also create 150 jobs in the Longlaville area. »Emmanuel Ladent  CEO  CARBIOS : “At CARBIOS  we have turned a vision into reality with the groundbreaking of the world's first PET biorecycling plant. Our revolutionary enzymatic depolymerization technology marks the beginning of a new era in plastic recycling  moving away from dependence on oil to a circular economy fuelled by PET waste itself. CARBIOS continues its mission by collaborating with strategic partners around the world and embarking on a promising commercial and international deployment. I would like to thank our partner brands and industrial partners present  particularly L'Oréal Groupe  L'Occitane en Provence  PUMA  Suntory Beverage & Food Europe  Salomon  On  CITEO and Novonesis for their contribution to the success of this historic event.”Philippe Pouletty  Founder and Chairman of the Board of Directors of CARBIOS: “We can help save the planet thanks to science  passionate teams  private and public funding to meet industrial and commercial stakes  and loyal partners. This groundbreaking ceremony for the Longlaville plant marks the start of our industrial and commercial roll-out to make CARBIOS a world leader in plastic recycling in the coming years.”Antoine Vanlaeys  Chief Operating Officer  L'Oréal Groupe: “We are delighted to be a long-standing partner of CARBIOS: an adventure that began nearly seven years ago with the co-founding of a consortium to industrialize the biorecycling of plastic  then in 2019 with our participation in the capital increase carried out by CARBIOS through our private equity fund BOLD  Business Opportunities for L'Oréal Development. The groundbreaking ceremony for CARBIOS’ PET biorecycling plant is another key milestone.

Accordingly  the Offer is not directed at persons subject to such restrictions  either directly or indirectly  and must not be accepted from any jurisdiction where the Offer is subject to restrictions.Neither the Draft Offer Document nor any other document relating to the Offer constitutes an offer to sell or acquire financial instruments or a solicitation of such an offer in any jurisdiction in which such an offer or solicitation would be unlawful  could not validly be made  or would require the publication of a prospectus or the completion of any other formality under local financial law. Holders of Shares located outside of France may only participate in the Offer to the extent that such participation is permitted under the local law to which they are subject.Accordingly  persons in possession of the Draft Offer Document are required to obtain information regarding any applicable local restrictions and to comply with such restrictions.

Any information documents  including the Draft Offer Document  are being disseminated to U.S. Holders on a basis comparable to the method pursuant to which such documents are provided to Believe’s other shareholders.As permitted under the Tier I Exemption  the settlement of the Offer is based on the applicable French law provisions  which differ from the settlement procedures customary in the United States  particularly as regards to the time when payment of the consideration is rendered.

To the extent the Offer is subject to U.S. securities laws  those laws only apply to U.S. Holders and thus will not give rise to claims on the part of any other person.It may be difficult for Believe’s shareholders to enforce their rights and any claims they may have arising under the U.S. federal or state securities laws in connection with the Offer  since Believe is located outside the United States  and some or all of its officers and directors may be residents of countries other than the United States. Believe’s shareholders may not be able to sue Believe or its officers or directors in a non-U.S. court for violations of U.S. securities laws. Further  it may be difficult to compel Believe and/or its respective affiliates to subject themselves to the jurisdiction or judgment of a U.S. court.To the extent permissible under applicable law or regulations  BidCo may from time to time and during the pendency of the Offer  and other than pursuant to the Offer  directly or indirectly purchase or arrange to purchase Shares outside the United States.

In addition  to the extent permissible under applicable law or regulation  the financial advisors to BidCo may also engage in ordinary course trading activities in securities of Believe  which may include purchases or arrangements to purchase such securities as long as such purchases or arrangements are in compliance with the applicable law. Information regarding such purchases or agreements will be published by the AMF on its website ( www.amf-france.org ).The receipt of cash pursuant to the Offer by a U.S. Holder may be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes and under applicable U.S. state and local  as well as foreign and other  tax laws. Each shareholder is urged to consult an independent professional adviser regarding the tax consequences of accepting the Offer. Neither BidCo nor its directors  officers  employees or agents or any other person acting on their behalf in connection with the Offer shall be responsible for any tax effects or liabilities resulting from acceptance of this Offer.Neither the SEC nor any U.S. State securities commission has approved or disapproved the Offer  or passed any comment upon the adequacy or completeness of the Draft Offer Document.

These include  but are not limited to  investing in the data platform  marketing technologies  artist services  infrastructure tech transformation  and continued automation of the central platform to drive efficiency.The Offeror intends to pursue a targeted value-based growth strategy to drive market share gains and operating leverage  including investing to drive net margin growth through premium tech-enabled services  as well as optimising the operating margin through positioning  pricing and automation.

The Offeror would in particular focus investments in Artist Services in the top 10 global music markets  in Label and Artist Solutions in the top 25 global music markets to build a targeted and optimised premium position  and building a first level of presence in Japan and the US  as well as unlocking an opportunity in publishing following the acquisition of Sentric in 2023.As the Group has demonstrated capacity to drive synergies and create value through its historical M&A track-record  the Offeror intends to support a targeted bolt-on M&A strategy  to be financed through a combination of debt and/or additional capital injection to drive the ongoing industry consolidation.Intentions regarding employmentThe Offer forms part of a plan in which the Company’s business activities and development are to continue.

These initiatives reinforce Sopra Steria’s leadership position in artificial intelligence and give our customers access to the very best these cutting-edge technologies have to offer.”Comments on Q1 2024 business activityRevenue came to €1 587.4 million  equating to total growth of 13.8% relative to Q1 2023. This growth included the positive impact of changes in scope of €184.1 million arising from the consolidation of CS Group and Tobania since 1 March 2023  and of Ordina since 1 October 2023. Currency fluctuations had a positive impact of €3.1 million.In an environment marked by a slowdown in discretionary investments in technology  a high basis of comparison (9.1% growth in Q1 2023) and an unfavourable calendar effect (1 fewer day)  organic growth held up well  equating to slight growth (0.3%). The most resilient sectors were the public sector  financial services and defence.The France reporting unit (39% of the Group total) generated revenue of €624.6 million  equating to negative organic growth of 2.6%. Most verticals saw a contraction in their revenue  including the aeronautics sector  which saw a business downturn of around 4.5% in the first quarter of 2024. On the other hand  the defence and transport verticals remained buoyant and growing.The United Kingdom reporting unit (15% of the Group total) posted revenue of €240.0 million  representing organic growth of 7.4%. Growth was driven by a very robust public sector and a private sector that started to feel the positive effects of new contracts signed in the second half of 2023  which will gradually ramp up over the course of 2024.The Other Europe reporting unit (35% of the Group total) posted €547.7 million in revenue  representing total growth of 33.5% following the consolidation of Ordina and Tobania. Organic growth came to 1.7%. Germany was hampered by a weaker economic backdrop than in the rest of Europe and a contraction in revenue. Scandinavia  Spain and Italy enjoyed brisk business activity  with growth of between 5% and 8%. Benelux  where the consolidation of three companies is underway  achieved a similar level of revenue as in Q1 2023 (€173.1 million on a pro forma basis).Revenue for Sopra Banking Software (7% of the Group total) came to €103.8 million  equating to an organic contraction of 4.1%  as expected for the first quarter. This contraction mainly arose from the 7.9% negative growth in services revenue. Subscriptions remained well on track with 21.1% growth  driven in particular by momentum in the digital solutions offered by Sopra Banking Platform and Sopra Financing Platform.The Other Solutions reporting unit (4% of the Group total) posted revenue of €71.2 million  representing organic growth of 0.8%. The Human Resources Solutions business (which generates 70% of the reporting unit’s revenue) grew by 3.7%. Property Management Solutions contracted by 5.3%  in line with forecasts.Changes in scopeSopra Steria recently clarified its strategy  stating its aim to refocus on digital services and solutions  with the ambition of becoming a compelling European alternative to global providers for major European clients in its strategic markets.Consequently  Sopra Steria announced (see press release of 21 February 2024) its plan to dispose of its banking software activities. Preparatory work is underway. The objective is to finalise this transaction by the end of Q2 2024  or during Q3 2024 at the latest.WorkforceAt end-March 2024  the Group’s net headcount stood at 56 273 people  compared with 53 724 people at 31 March 2023.

As the Shares have been negotiable at any time since the Company’s IPO  the Board of Directors decided on April 18  2024 (i) to consider that all references in the terms and conditions of the Warrants 2016-1  2016-2 and 2018-1 and BSPCE 2016-1  2016-2  2018-1 and 2019-1 to a “Liquidity Event” should be considered null and void and therefore deleted  and (ii) to note that the Warrants and BSPCEs will therefore remain exercisable until their expiry date.As a result of such decision  1 024 257 BSPCE and 258 194 Warrants are exercisable during the Offer and  as set out in Section 1.2.3 of the Press Release  the Shares issued before the closing of the Offer as a result of the exercise of outstanding BSPCE and Warrants may be tendered to the Offer by their holders  i.e.  a maximum of 3 166 570 Shares.1.3.

Accordingly  the Offer is not directed at persons subject to such restrictions  either directly or indirectly  and must not be accepted from any jurisdiction where the Offer is subject to restrictions.Neither the Draft Offer Document nor any other document relating to the Offer constitutes an offer to sell or acquire financial instruments or a solicitation of such an offer in any jurisdiction in which such an offer or solicitation would be unlawful  could not validly be made  or would require the publication of a prospectus or the completion of any other formality under local financial law. Holders of Shares located outside of France may only participate in the Offer to the extent that such participation is permitted under the local law to which they are subject.Accordingly  persons in possession of the Draft Offer Document and Draft Response Document are required to obtain information regarding any applicable local restrictions and to comply with such restrictions.

Shareholders in the United States are advised that the securities of Believe are not listed on a U.S. securities exchange and that Believe is not subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934  as amended (the “U.S. Exchange Act”)  and is not required to  and does not  file any reports with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) thereunder.The Offer is made in the United States pursuant to Section 14(e) and Regulation 14E of the U.S. Exchange Act  subject to exemptions provided by Rule 14d-1(c) under the U.S. Exchange Act for a Tier I tender offer (the “Tier I Exemption”)  and otherwise in accordance with the disclosure and procedural requirements of French law  including with respect to withdrawal rights  the offer timetable  settlement procedures  waiver of conditions and timing of payments  which are different from those applicable under U.S. domestic tender offer procedures and law. Holders of securities of Believe domiciled in the United States (the “U.S. Holders”) are encouraged to consult with their own advisors regarding the Offer.The Offer is made to the U.S. Holders on the same terms and conditions as those made to all other shareholders of Believe to whom an offer is made. Any information documents  including the Draft Offer Document and the Draft Response Document  are being disseminated to U.S. Holders on a basis comparable to the method pursuant to which such documents are provided to Believe’s other shareholders.As permitted under the Tier I Exemption  the settlement of the Offer is based on the applicable French law provisions  which differ from the settlement procedures customary in the United States  particularly as regards to the time when payment of the consideration is rendered. The Offer  which is subject to French law  is being made to the U.S. Holders in accordance with the applicable U.S. securities laws  and applicable exemptions thereunder  in particular the Tier I Exemption. To the extent the Offer is subject to U.S. securities laws  those laws only apply to U.S. Holders and thus will not give rise to claims on the part of any other person.It may be difficult for Believe’s shareholders to enforce their rights and any claims they may have arising under the U.S. federal or state securities laws in connection with the Offer  since Believe is located outside the United States  and some or all of its officers and Directors may be residents of countries other than the United States. Believe’s shareholders may not be able to sue Believe or its officers or Directors in a non-U.S. court for violations of U.S. securities laws. Further  it may be difficult to compel Believe and/or its respective affiliates to subject themselves to the jurisdiction or judgment of a U.S. court.To the extent permissible under applicable law or regulations  BidCo may from time to time and during the pendency of the Offer  and other than pursuant to the Offer  directly or indirectly purchase or arrange to purchase Shares outside the United States. These purchases may occur either in the open market at prevailing prices or in private transactions at negotiated prices. In addition  to the extent permissible under applicable law or regulation  the financial advisors to BidCo may also engage in ordinary course trading activities in securities of Believe  which may include purchases or arrangements to purchase such securities as long as such purchases or arrangements are in compliance with the applicable law. Information regarding such purchases or agreements will be published by the AMF on its website ( www.amf-france.org ).The receipt of cash pursuant to the Offer by a U.S. Holder may be a taxable transaction for U.S. federal income tax purposes and under applicable U.S. state and local  as well as foreign and other  tax laws. Each shareholder is urged to consult an independent professional adviser regarding the tax consequences of accepting the Offer. Neither BidCo nor its Directors  officers  employees or agents or any other person acting on their behalf in connection with the Offer shall be responsible for any tax effects or liabilities resulting from acceptance of this Offer.Neither the SEC nor any U.S. State securities commission has approved or disapproved the Offer  or passed any comment upon the adequacy or completeness of the Draft Offer Document or the Draft Response Document. Any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense in the in the United States.2.

The draft Offer will be filed in the following days.In accordance with best corporate governance practices  as well as with AMF Instruction n°2006-08 and AMF Recommendation 2006-15  the Board of Directors set up an ad hoc committee at its October 20  2023 meeting  tasked with proposing the appointment of an independent expert to the Company’s Board of Directors  overseeing the monitoring of its work and preparing a draft reasoned opinion. This committee comprises three independent members of the Board of Directors - namely Mrs. Orla Noonan  Fonds Stratégique de Participations (represented by Mrs. Cécile Frot-Coutaz) and Mrs. Anne France Laclide-Drouin (the ""Ad Hoc Committee"").At its meeting on February 11  2024  the Board appointed Ledouble  represented by Mrs. Agnès Piniot and Mr. Romain Delafont  on the recommendation of the Ad Hoc Committee  as independent expert in accordance with the provisions of article 261-1 I  2° and 4° of the General regulation of the AMF  with a mandate to prepare a report on the financial terms of the Offer (the ""Independent Expert"").Prior to today’s meeting  the following documents were made available to the members of the Board of Directors  to enable them to obtain all the information they need to issue their reasoned opinion:the draft offer document drawn up by the Offeror in accordance with article 231-18 of the General regulation of the AMF  which contains in particular the reasons for and background to the Offer  the Offeror’s intentions over the next twelve (12) months  and the factors taken into account by BNP Paribas and Goldman Sachs in assessing the Offer Price  as presenting banks of the Offer (the "" Presenting Banks "")  as well as the summary of the main agreements relating to the Offer (the "" Draft Offer Document "")  which will be filed by the Offeror with the AMF when the Offer is filed;"")  as well as the summary of the main agreements relating to the Offer (the "" "")  which will be filed by the Offeror with the AMF when the Offer is filed; the draft response document prepared by the Company in accordance with article 231-19 of the General regulation of the AMF (the "" Draft Response Document "")  which remains to be completed by the Board of Directors’ reasoned opinion on the Offer  and which is intended to be filed by the Company with the AMF concurrently with the filing of the Offer and the Draft Offer Document;"")  which remains to be completed by the Board of Directors’ reasoned opinion on the Offer  and which is intended to be filed by the Company with the AMF concurrently with the filing of the Offer and the Draft Offer Document; the draft reasoned opinion drawn up by the Ad Hoc Committee in accordance with Article 261-1  III of the General regulation of the AMF;the report by Ledouble  Independent Expert  dated April 18  2024  the conclusions of which are summarized hereafter;the financial opinion of Citigroup Global Markets Europe AG bank (“Citi”)  dated April 18  2024  addressed to the members of the Board of Directors9.The Board of Directors wishes to point out that  to enable it to diligently carry out its task of analyzing the Offeror’s Offer and issuing a reasoned opinion on it  it has been assisted by financial advisors (Citi) and legal counsel (Gide Loyrette Nouel A.A.R.P.I.  ""Gide"").The Board of Directors is composed solely of independent directors  the other directors being either linked to the Consortium (Mr. Denis Ladegaillerie and Mr. John Doran) or linked to a company contractually bound to sell its shares to the Consortium (Mr. Alain Caffi)10.Main terms of the Offer and its contextOrigin of the OfferOn October 9  2023  the Technology Crossover Venture (""TCV"") fund approached the Board of Directors  indicating that it was considering joining forces with one or more co-investors to set up an investment vehicle  in which the Manager would participate by contributing his shares  with a view to implementing a public tender offer to delist the Company.On this occasion  the Manager had explained to the Board of Directors that the listing had not brought the Company the main expected benefits  despite the Company’s very good operating performance. In particular  liquidity had proved insufficient to enable shareholders wishing to realize their investment to do so under favorable conditions. In addition  the disappointing share price had hampered Believe’s ability to play its role as a consolidator in the sector.The Manager indicated that  in these conditions  backing the Company with one or more investment funds with substantial financial resources and a track record of investment in music  and supporting the management team’s growth and consolidation objectives  seemed to him the best solution to meet Believe’s objectives.He indicated that he had been in regular contact with industrialists in the sector. From these contacts it emerged that no industrialist seemed in a position to make an offer. For reasons of confidentiality  he felt it was important to concentrate on a small pool of financial investors who had shown an interest in principle on the basis of exploratory discussions.On this basis  TCV and the Manager indicated that they would solicit interest in principle from a limited number of financial investors  and that they would not give them access to inside information at this stage. The Board of Directors decided to appoint Gide as legal counsel to the Company and the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors established an Ad Hoc Committee  comprising three independent members - namely Mrs. Orla Noonan  Fonds Stratégique de Participations (represented by Mrs. Cécile Frot-Coutaz)  and Mrs. Anne-France Laclide-Drouin - to ensure that the Board of Directors was well organized in the event of the process leading to a tender offer  and more generally to facilitate the work of the Board of Directors in relation to the project  including in its preparatory phase.On December 20  2023  TCV and the Manager informed the Board of Directors of the outcome of the process discussed on October 9  2023. After they had received several preliminary offers as part of a competitive bidding process  TCV and the Manager considered EQT’s proposal to be the most advantageous - including financially - and the best suited to the Company’s objectives. For reasons of efficiency and confidentiality  TCV and the Manager proposed that in-depth discussions should only take place with EQT. On this occasion  TCV and the Manager requested that EQT (and the other members of the future Consortium) be given access to certain confidential information within the framework of a ""data room"" secured by confidentiality agreements in line with standard practice. After the Company’s legal counsel had confirmed that this process complied with applicable regulations  the Board took note of it. On this occasion  the Board appointed Citi as the Company’s financial advisor.Following this due diligence  on February 6  2024  the Company received an offer letter from the Consortium for a proposal likely to lead to the filing of a tender offer for the Company’s shares at a price of 14 euros per share. The filing of the said offer was conditional on (i) the conclusion of agreements relating to the acquisition of controlling interests  subject to the completion of confirmatory due diligence work  and (ii) a reasoned opinion from the Board of Directors of the Company concluding that the offer was in the interests of the Company  its employees and its shareholders  and recommending that shareholders tender their shares to the offer.Formulation of the OfferFollowing discussions between the members of the Ad Hoc Committee and the Consortium with a view to improving the offer  and in particular its financial terms  on February 11  2024  the Company received the Consortium’s revised tender offer proposal at a price of 15 euros per share. This offer followed the Consortium’s decision to acquire the shares of TCV Luxco BD S.à r.l.  Ventech and XAnge  Believe’s historical shareholders  holding respectively 41.14%  12.03% and 6.29% of Believe’s share capital  at a price of 15 euros (the ""Block Acquisition""). The Consortium also contemplated that the Manager would contribute a portion of his shares in the Company to the Offeror (representing 11.17% of the share capital) and sell it the remaining portion (representing 1.29% of the share capital). These acquisitions and contributions would have brought the Consortium’s stake in the Company’s share capital to 71.92%. It should also be noted that the Consortium had obtained commitments from other Company shareholders to tender their shares to the Offer (representing 3% of the Company’s share capital).Following the Block Acquisition and the contribution  the Consortium intended to file the Offer with a view of delisting the Company  should the Consortium reach the levels of shareholding necessary to initiate a squeeze-out.The Block Acquisition  as well as the filing of the Offer  were subject to two conditions:on the one hand  obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals (the "" Regulatory Condition ""); and""); and on the other hand  the Board’s recommendation of the Offer following in particular (x) the report of the independent expert stipulating  in its conclusion presented as a fairness opinion  that the Offer is fair from a financial point of view  including for a squeeze-out  and that there are no related agreements likely to affect the equal treatment of shareholders  and (y) the consultation of the employee representative committee (comité social et économique)  it being understood that the Board’s recommendation shall take the form of a reasoned opinion concluding unreservedly that the Offer is in the interests of the Company  its employees and its shareholders  and recommending that shareholders tender their shares to the Offer (the ""Favorable Opinion Condition"").The Offer would be compulsory  following completion of the Block Acquisition. It would be carried out under the simplified procedure  in accordance with the provisions of articles 233-1 et seq. of the General regulation of the AMF  and would have been open for ten (10) trading days.On the same day  the Board of Directors met  in particular  to :unanimously approve the Offer  without prejudice to the conclusions of its detailed study of the terms and conditions of the transaction  in the light in particular of the report to be drawn up by the Independent Expert;confirm the creation of the Ad Hoc Committee and its composition; andappoint  on the recommendation of the Ad Hoc Committee  Ledouble  represented by Agnès Piniot and Romain Delafont  as Independent Expert  to prepare a report on the financial terms of the Offer.On February 12  2024 (before trading)  the Consortium and then the Company issued press releases announcing the terms of the Consortium’s proposal and the Offer.Warner Music Group’s potential interestOn February 21  2024  Warner Music group (""WMG"") approached the Company to initiate discussions regarding a potential combination of Believe with WMG and to obtain access to confidential information with a view to possibly presenting a more attractive offer to the Company and its shareholders.The Ad Hoc Committee  seeking to assess whether WMG’s proposal could constitute an alternative to the Consortium’s offer on more advantageous financial terms  requested certain clarifications from WMG.Following discussions between the members of the Ad Hoc Committee  on February 24  2024  the Board of Directors met to determine the follow-up to be given to WMG’s expression of interest and approved  by unanimous vote of its independent members  a draft response to WMG’s letter.Consequently  on February 25  2024  the Ad Hoc Committee sent a letter to WMG stating that it had taken note of its expression of interest  had discussed it and  as a result  requested a certain number of clarifications in order to enter into discussions as the case may be  and grant it access to confidential information. In particular  the Ad Hoc Committee asked WMG to indicate the price it would be prepared to offer  even on a preliminary basis  and to explain how it thought it would be able to formulate a competing offer in view of the Consortium’s commitment to the Block Acquisition.On February 27  2024  WMG indicated to Board members that  at this stage  it should be able to value Believe’s shares at a minimum of 17 euros per share (dividend coupon attached)  based on the public information currently available  while reaffirming that its approach did not constitute an offer or constitute any obligation to make an offer  nor did it evidence an intention to make an offer. It also stated that it did not see how the Board of Directors could give its recommendation on the Consortium’s offer if there were a better offer  and that under these conditions the Favorable Opinion Condition would not be satisfied.On February 27  2024  the Ad Hoc Committee met to discuss the response to WMG’s second letter.Following WMG’s expression of interest  Upbeat informed the Board of Directors on February 28  2024 (and the public by way of a press release on February 29  2024)  that it had a unilateral right to waive the Board’s Favorable Opinion Condition  a unilateral waiver option stipulated in the contracts for the Block Acquisition  as well as its decision to waive this condition. Upbeat also informed the Board of Directors that  consequently  the completion of the Block Acquisition remained exclusively subject to the Regulatory Condition (under antitrust law)  which Upbeat expected to obtain in a short timeframe.In a letter dated March 2  2024  WMG informed the Company that it considered the waiver of the Favorable Opinion Condition to be contrary to stock market regulations  and requested access to confidential information in order to make a competing offer for the Company’s shares.Between February 29  2024 and March 5  2024  the Ad-Hoc Committee met several times to discuss the follow-up to the Consortium’s waiver of the Favorable Opinion Condition and WMG’s position.The Ad-Hoc Committee considered that its role was to exercise all due diligence  on the one hand to ensure that the process underway complied with the applicable rules - in particular stock market regulations - and  more generally  to ensure that shareholders could decide whether or not to tender their shares to the best possible offer  also taking into account the circumstances at hand (including any contractual commitments that certain shareholders may have chosen to enter into).In this context  upon obtaining the opinion of its legal counsel  the Ad Hoc Committee asked the latter to refer the matter to the AMF by letter dated March 5  2024  in order to ask the Authority whether (i) Upbeat was in a position  at the time it did so  to unilaterally waive the Favorable Opinion Condition  given that this option was granted in accordance with the agreements entered into for the Block Acquisition  or if (ii) considering the Favorable Opinion Condition and the expression of interest from an interested third party at a potentially higher price  the principles of tender offers  including the principle of free confrontation of offers and competing offers  prevented such waiver of the Favorable Opinion Condition.In a press release dated March 7  2024  WMG publicly reiterated its expression of interest. In this press release  WMG indicated that it was awaiting access to a limited list of key due diligence information before confirming its indicative price of a minimum of 17 euros per share (dividend coupon attached). WMG also stated that it considered the Consortium’s waiver of the Board’s Favorable Opinion Condition to be contrary to French stock market regulations  and that the validity of this waiver could be challenged.The Consortium issued a press release in response on March 8  2024  stating that  in its view  its decision to waive the Favorable Opinion Condition was perfectly valid and had been taken in full compliance with French regulations. The Consortium confirmed that  following completion of the Block Acquisition  it would file a mandatory tender offer to acquire the remaining 28% at the same price of 15 euros per share paid to the selling shareholders of the blocks  as required by French tender offer regulations.Following these events  the Ad Hoc Committee  after discussing them at its meeting on March 9  2023  issued a press release on March 11  2024 to inform the market that it had referred the matter to the AMF regarding the validity of the Consortium’s waiver of the Favorable Opinion Condition.In its letter dated March 22  2024 to the Chair of the Ad-Hoc Committee  the AMF stated:""In its meeting of March 22  2024  the board of the AMF considered that considered that the waiver by the consortium of the condition precedent  stipulated for its sole benefit - of which the market was unaware - of the favorable opinion of the Board of Directors  in view of the expression of interest  which was not public at that stage  of a third party  at a higher indicative price  infringes the guiding principles of public bid law  which are part of public policy  and in particular the principles of fairness  transparency and the free confrontation of offers and competing offers within the meaning of article 231-3 of the General Regulation.As mentioned in your referral  the stipulation of the aforementioned condition precedent made the execution of the purchase agreements dependent on the favorable reasoned opinion of the target company’s board of directors  which is an essential regulatory stage in the progress of a public offer. This condition was therefore directly linked to the terms and conditions of the tender offer.By exercising  in the aforementioned context  its right to unilaterally waive the said condition precedent  stipulated for its sole benefit  while WMG had made known an expression of interest valuing Believe at at least 17 euros per share  the consortium  which was aware of this non-public information  granted itself a decisive advantage in the success of its offer  in violation of the principles of fairness  transparency and the free confrontation of offers and competing offers.""In such context  on March 23  2024  the Ad Hoc Committee and then the Board of Directors met. The Board of Directors (by a vote of its independent members only) decided to invite WMG to submit a binding  unconditional and fully-funded offer for Believe. To this end  the Company gave WMG access to a data room  subject to appropriate confidentiality undertaking. The Board of Directors asked WMG to submit its binding offer no later than April 7  2024.Between March 23  2024 and April 6  2024 :WMG had access to the Company’s confidential information as part of a data room process  and also benefited from several expert sessions of the Company and Q&A sessions with the Company’s management and teams;the Ad Hoc Committee met on several occasions to discuss the due diligence work in progress  and ensured that competitors had equal access to information;the Ad Hoc Committee also held discussions with WMG and its legal counsel on the one hand  and with the Consortium on the other hand  to seek the best proposal for the Company and its stakeholders  although these discussions did not result in any concrete proposals.On April 6  2024  WMG informed the Ad-Hoc Committee that it would not be making an offer for Believe  and announced it in a press release.The Ad-Hoc Committee took note of such information and indicated that it wished to meet with interested parties  including the Consortium  before determining how to proceed.The Offer  subject of this opinionFollowing such withdrawal  the Consortium informed the Ad-Hoc Committee that it remained seized by its initial proposal dated February 11  2024.However  following discussions with the independent expert and the Ad-Hoc Committee  the Consortium indicated in a press release dated March 12  2024  that it no longer intended to request a squeeze-out as part of the Offer.Constitution of the Ad Hoc CommitteeAt its meeting on October 20  2023  the Board of Directors decided to set up an Ad Hoc Committee comprising three independent Board members - namely Mrs. Orla Noonan  Fonds Stratégique de Participations (represented by Mrs. Cécile Frot-Coutaz)  and Mrs. Anne-France Laclide-Drouin - to ensure that the Board of Directors was well organized in the event of the process leading to a tender offer  and more generally to facilitate the work of the Board of Directors in relation to the project  including in its preparatory phase. The creation of the Ad Hoc Committee and its composition were confirmed at the meeting of the Board of Directors on February 11  2024  including in order to propose to the Board the appointment of an independent expert  to oversee the monitoring of its work and to prepare a draft reasoned opinion.Process and basis for the appointment of the Independent ExpertInsofar as (i) the Company’s senior executives have entered into an agreement with the Offeror that could affect their independence  (ii) various agreements that could be considered related to the Offer have been entered into between the Offeror and certain shareholders and/or senior executives of the Company  and (iii) the Offer is likely to generate conflicts of interest within the Board of Directors  the Offer requires the appointment of an Independent Expert.Once informed of the Consortium’s project  which could result in the obligation to file a public tender offer  the members of the Ad Hoc Committee studied the profiles of several experts likely to be appointed as independent experts  and were able to interview two of them  taking into account in particular (i) the absence of any present or past links with the Company or the Offeror  (ii) the recent experience of the proposed experts in similar transactions  (iii) their financial proposal and (iv) more generally  the professional reputation and human and material resources of these experts.At their meeting on February 11  2024  the members of the Ad Hoc Committee unanimously decided to recommend the firm Ledouble  represented by Mrs. Agnès Piniot and Mr. Romain Delafont  which is regularly involved in this type of transaction and offers all the guarantees  in terms of independence  competence and resources  to carry out the mission of independent expert in the context of the proposed Offer.On the same day  the Board of Directors  on the recommendation of the Ad Hoc Committee  decided to appoint Ledouble as independent expert to draw up a report on the financial terms of the Offer.The firm Ledouble  via Mrs Agnès Piniot and Mr Romain Delafont  indicated its acceptance of this appointment as independent expert and confirmed that it had no conflict of interest with the various parties involved  and that it had sufficient material resources and availability to carry out its assignment during the period in question.Aware of the Consortium’s intention not to request a squeeze-out in connection with the Offer  and on the basis of the Company’s engagement letter  the Independent Expert issued its report in accordance with the provisions of article 261-1  I 2°and 4° of the General regulation of the AMF. Ledouble’s engagement letter is appended to the Independent Expert’s report.Follow-up of the Independent Expert’s work by the Ad Hoc CommitteeMrs. Orla Noonan  chairperson of the Ad Hoc Committee  reports on its work.The Ad Hoc Committee has met on a number of occasions since it was informed of the implementation at the end of 2023 of a competitive process by the Manager and TCV to find one or more co-investors to create a consortium with the aim of making a public tender offer for all the Company’s shares.In particular  the Ad Hoc Committee met with the Independent Expert:in February 2024  for an initial introductory briefing on its mission and the information required to begin its work;on February 26  2024  in the presence of the Company’s financial and legal advisors  to discuss the Independent Expert’s initial findings and  in particular  to inform him of WMG’s expression of interest;on March 8  2024  in the presence of the Company’s financial and legal advisors  for a detailed presentation by the Independent Expert of its initial findings;on April 10  2024  in the presence of the Company’s financial and legal advisors  for a presentation of its conclusions to date.Throughout this period  the Ad Hoc Committee ensured that the Independent Expert had in its possession all the information it considered necessary for the completion of its mission  and that it was in a position to carry out its work under satisfactory conditions.The Independent Expert was able to exchange views with the Company’s management on several occasions  as well as with the Offeror and the Presenting Banks.The Company provided the Independent Expert with a number of financial and legal documents  in particular the Company’s business plan for the period 2024-2030 prepared by management and approved by the Board of Directors on January 12  202411.Work of the Independent Expert and conclusions of its reportFollowing the exchanges between the Ad Hoc Committee and the Independent Expert detailed above  Ledouble submitted its report to the Board of Directors on April 18  2024.The Independent Expert  in the persons of Mrs. Agnès Piniot and Mr. Romain Delafont  presented a summary of its work and the conclusions of its report to the members of the Board of Directors. These conclusions can be summarized as follows  bearing in mind that the Independent Expert refers to the full text of its report (which alone is authentic):“7. SummaryIn accordance with the scope of the Independent Expert's Mission (§ 1.6.1)  we have verified:the fairness of the financial terms of the Offer  with regard to the value of the Share resulting from the Multicriteria Valuation;the absence of provisions in the Related Agreements and Transactions that could be prejudicial to the interests of Minority Shareholders.We remind you that we assess the Offer Price by reference to the financial conditions of the Offer and the valuation of the Share in the current circumstances  which  by definition  differ from the conditions under which Shareholders were able  on a case-by-case basis  to acquire their Shares.The Offer Price is currently the best offer from a financial point of view  bearing in mind that:the Blocks Acquisitions were carried out following a search for an investor conducted among several investment funds with references in the music industry  none of the potential investors having made a binding or non-binding offer at a price higher than the Offer Price;on April 6  2024  after carrying out due diligence  WMG decided not to submit an offer.We believe that the Business Plan  which underpins the Multicriteria Evaluation  reflects a voluntarist vision and captures Believe's value potential over the medium and long term. The forecasts take into account the development prospects of the rapidly changing music market  and postulate the Group's ability to gain market share while improving profitability and accelerating the deployment of its external growth strategy. It also assumes the absence of any major contingencies  despite the existence of threats and risks that could slow down or compromise the achievement of its objectives.Given Management's confidence in its ability to achieve the objectives set out in the Business Plan  and the performance achieved since the IPO  we have not taken into account any specific execution risks. We note  however  that given the strong growth phase in which the Company finds itself  which implies investment efforts in the short and medium term and improved profitability in the longer term  the present value of the Share is particularly sensitive to the discounting parameters and assumptions of the Business Plan  notably in terms of target profitability.In addition  most of our value ranges include a significant contribution from future acquisitions to the current Share value  bearing in mind that these transactions  which involve specific risk factors  notably in terms of timing and integration  have not yet been initiated.In our intrinsic valuation approach  the Offer Price represents a discount of 12.8% to the central value of the Share including the impact of external growth transactions  and a premium of 2.7% to the central value of the Share excluding external growth.Our relative valuations have been implemented taking into account the specificities of the Group. Overall  the Offer Price implies premiums over values based on short- and medium-term forecast metrics  and discounts for values based on estimated long-term metrics  which nevertheless present a higher execution risk.Lastly  the Offer Price shows significant premiums over the past twelve months’ Share prices  ranging from 21.0% to 52.2%  depending on the dates and periods of observation.We also note that:the proposed Offer presents the advantage  for Minority Shareholders  of obtaining a liquidity window at a price identical to that retained for the Blocks Acquisitions and with a significant premium compared with the stock market prices prior to the announcement of the Offer;progress over time and the achievement of the objectives set out in the Business Plan could result  all other things being equal  in a significant increase in Share value. Minority Shareholders who do not wish to tender their shares to the Offer will  however  remain exposed to risks that could also have a downward impact on Share value;after discussions with the Independent Expert and the Ad Hoc Committee  the Offeror has waived its request regarding the squeeze-out procedure  a decision that underlines our fairness opinion which is given in these circumstances;Minority Shareholders may choose to tender their shares to the Offer or remain shareholders of the Company.The Related Agreements and Transactions have no impact on our assessment of the Offer Price fairness (§ 5).We have responded to the comments made orally and by e-mail by a minority shareholder (§6).8. ConclusionIn the light of all the elements of assessment described in our summary (§ 7)  and following our valuation of the Share  we are in a position to conclude that the terms of the Offer are fair  from a financial point of view  to the Shareholders voluntarily tendering their shares to the Offer.We have not identified any provisions in the Related Agreements and Transactions that might be prejudicial to the interests of the Shareholders whose securities are targeted by the Offer.”Main comments received from shareholders in accordance with stock market regulationsThe Company has not received any comments from minority shareholders.It notes that the Independent Expert has received comments from a shareholder  to which the Independent Expert has replied in its report.Recommendations of the Ad Hoc CommitteeOn April 18  2024 the Ad Hoc Committee met and finalized its recommendation to the Board of Directors in light of the Independent Expert’s report.The chairperson of the Ad Hoc Committee presents the following conclusions to the Board of Directors:Regarding the interest of the Offer for the CompanyThe Ad Hoc Committee notes that the Offeror’s intentions are described in paragraph 1.2.1 of the Draft Offer Document. In particular  it is stated that ""The Offeror intends to maintain the Group’s integrity  and  with the support of the current management team  to continue the main strategic orientations implemented by the Company and does not intend to modify the operational model of the Company  outside the normal evolution of the business"".The Ad Hoc Committee thus notes that the Offer will enable the Company to be backed by a controlling shareholder whose shareholders have substantial financial resources  and whose project is in line with the strategy deployed by the Company and in support of its development strategy.The Offer is in line with the strategy pursued by management  while benefiting from the support of leading shareholders aligned with its development strategy and with the ability to support the company in the next phase of growth and market consolidation. This should enable the Company to strengthen its positioning to seize market opportunities driven by the digital transformation of artists worldwide in the music and publishing sectors  with the ambition of building a global player in independent music that relies on technology to adapt to the digital world.Having considered the above  the Ad Hoc Committee confirms the interest of the Offer for the Company.Regarding the interest of the Offer for employeesThe Offeror indicated in its Draft Offer Document (paragraph 1.2.2) that “The Offer forms part of a plan in which the Company’s business activities and development are to continue. As a result  the Offer should not in itself result in any particular impact on the Company’s workforce  wage policy or human resource management policy.”It should be noted that the applicable procedures for informing and consulting the Company’s social and economic committee (“CSE”) have been followed.The CSE  in its deliberation of March 1  2024  approved the proposed sale of shares.Aware of the above  and that the Offer is in line with the Company’s strategy  the Ad Hoc Committee confirms the interest of the Offer for the employees.With regard to the Offer Price and the interest of the Offer for the Company’s shareholdersThe Ad Hoc Committee has taken note of the Independent Expert’s report  which concludes that the terms of the Offer are fair  from a financial point of view  to the shareholders voluntarily tendering their shares to the Offer.The Ad Hoc Committee also notes that Citi concluded that  as of the date of the delivery of its financial opinion (i.e.  April 18  2024)  the Offer Price is fair  from a financial point of view  to the shareholders of the Company (other than the Manager and the sellers as part of the Block Acquisition).The Ad Hoc Committee first notes that the Offer price corresponds to the price negotiated by the Offeror with the sellers of the majority blocks  following a competitive process and discussions with the Board of Directors  with the Independent Expert concluding that there are no related elements likely to affect the equal treatment of the other shareholders. It notes that no competing offer have materialized. In particular  WMG decided not to submit a binding offer12.The Ad Hoc Committee also notes that the Offer generates premiums ranging from 38.2% to 52.2% over the average share price13  and a 50% premium over the share price before rumors14  but remains below the IPO price of 19.50 euros per share.The Ad Hoc Committee therefore notes that a Believe shareholder wishing to sell its shares can do so in an organized manner  without its ability to sell being impacted by the limited liquidity of the stock  at a substantial premium to relevant price references  and at a price that has convinced professional shareholders holding the majority of the capital to sell their shares.The Ad Hoc Committee also notes that the price is within the range of the independent expert’s intrinsic discounted cash flow analysis. However  the price represents a discount of 12.8% compared with the central value of the share in this context  which stands at 17.20 euros per share (even if this price represents a slight premium of 2.4% compared with the central value excluding external growth); it is noted  however  that external growth is an intrinsic part of the Company’s business plan.Moreover  the value of the share in an intrinsic discounted cash flow analysis seems particularly sensitive to discounting parameters and business plan assumptions  in particular the ability to carry out and integrate future external growth operations.With regard to other methods  the Ad Hoc Committee notes that the Independent Expert’s report shows the following values for criteria other than the stock share price and discounted cash flow analysis:premiums between 2.7% and 44.2% on analogical values based on stock market multiples applied by the Independent Expert to the performance expected by management in the short and medium term  taking into account in particular the growth and profitability differential between Believe and Market Comparables;premiums between 6.4% and 70.5% on values which come from Comparable Transactions;a discount of 8.0% to the median analysts’ target price observed prior to the announcement of the proposed Offer.The Ad Hoc Committee has noted that the Offeror has in fine decided to keep the Company’s shares listed following the Offer. This change compared with the initial proposal will enable shareholders who wish so to remain involved in the Company’s development and growth prospects  and in the potential creation of value.The Ad Hoc Committee points out  however  that shareholders opting for this option would remain exposed to the Company’s risks. The Ad Hoc Committee also notes that  depending on the rate of contribution to the Offer  the liquidity of the share may also be reduced.Reasoned opinion of the Board of DirectorsThe Board of Directors  composed solely of the independent directors present15  after deliberation  on the recommendation of the Ad Hoc Committee  and after having taken note of all the information made available to its members  in particular (i) the elements of assessment of the Offer Price set out in the Draft Offer Document  (ii) the objectives and intentions expressed by the Offeror in the Draft Offer Document  (iii) the report of the Independent Expert  and (iv) the conclusions of the review carried out by the members of the Ad Hoc Committee  including the latter’s favorable opinion on the Offer:considers that the Offer is consistent with the interests of the Company and its employees  in particular since the Offer is not expected to have any particular impact on employment and is in line with the Company’s strategy by enabling the Company to benefit from support of leading shareholders aligned with its development strategy and with the ability to support the company in the next phase of growth and market consolidation;considers that the Offer is consistent with the interests of minority shareholders wishing to realize their investment  by enabling them to benefit from immediate and full liquidity at a significant premium over the relevant stock price averages  and at the same price as that obtained by the sellers of majority blocks  and recommends that minority shareholders pursuing this objective tender their shares to the Offer;notes that the Offer is in line with the interests of shareholders wishing to remain associated with the Company’s potential  by enabling those who decide not to tender their shares to the Offer to remain shareholders of the Company while its listing is maintained  such shareholders thereby accepting to remain exposed to the associated risks  including the risk of a reduction in the liquidity of the share depending on the rate of tender to the Offer;decides not to tender the treasury shares held by the Company;approves the Draft Response Document; andgrants full powers to the Chief Executive Officer to finalize  amend and allow the filing  in the name and on behalf of the Company  of the Draft Response Document  as well as the ""Other Information"" document relating to the Company’s other legal  financial and accounting information  and any other document useful or necessary for the Offer  and more generally to take any decision  perform any act or sign any document necessary for the Offer and its implementation.”4.

INDEPENDENT EXPERT’S REPORTIn accordance with Article 261-1  I  2° and 4° of the general regulation of the AMF  Ledouble  represented by Mrs. Agnès Piniot and Mr. Romain Delafont  has been appointed by the Board of Directors on recommendation of the Ad-Hoc Committee as Independent Expert on February 11  2024  in order to draw up a report enabling the assessment of the fairness of the Offer’s financial conditions.The conclusions of the report  dated April 18  2024  are reproduced hereinafter:“7. SummaryIn accordance with the scope of the Independent Expert's Mission (§ 1.6.1)  we have verified:the fairness of the financial terms of the Offer  with regard to the value of the Share resulting from the Multicriteria Valuation;the absence of provisions in the Related Agreements and Transactions that could be prejudicial to the interests of Minority Shareholders.We remind you that we assess the Offer Price by reference to the financial conditions of the Offer and the valuation of the Share in the current circumstances  which  by definition  differ from the conditions under which Shareholders were able  on a case-by-case basis  to acquire their Shares.The Offer Price is currently the best offer from a financial point of view  bearing in mind that:the Blocks Acquisitions were carried out following a search for an investor conducted among several investment funds with references in the music industry  none of the potential investors having made a binding or non-binding offer at a price higher than the Offer Price;on April 6  2024  after carrying out due diligence  WMG decided not to submit an offer.We believe that the Business Plan  which underpins the Multicriteria Evaluation  reflects a voluntarist vision and captures Believe's value potential over the medium and long term.

It also assumes the absence of any major contingencies  despite the existence of threats and risks that could slow down or compromise the achievement of its objectives.Given Management's confidence in its ability to achieve the objectives set out in the Business Plan  and the performance achieved since the IPO  we have not taken into account any specific execution risks. We note  however  that given the strong growth phase in which the Company finds itself  which implies investment efforts in the short and medium term and improved profitability in the longer term  the present value of the Share is particularly sensitive to the discounting parameters and assumptions of the Business Plan  notably in terms of target profitability.In addition  most of our value ranges include a significant contribution from future acquisitions to the current Share value  bearing in mind that these transactions  which involve specific risk factors  notably in terms of timing and integration  have not yet been initiated.In our intrinsic valuation approach  the Offer Price represents a discount of 12.8% to the central value of the Share including the impact of external growth transactions  and a premium of 2.7% to the central value of the Share excluding external growth.Our relative valuations have been implemented taking into account the specificities of the Group. Overall  the Offer Price implies premiums over values based on short- and medium-term forecast metrics  and discounts for values based on estimated long-term metrics  which nevertheless present a higher execution risk.Lastly  the Offer Price shows significant premiums over the past twelve months’ Share prices  ranging from 21.0% to 52.2%  depending on the dates and periods of observation.We also note that:the proposed Offer presents the advantage  for Minority Shareholders  of obtaining a liquidity window at a price identical to that retained for the Blocks Acquisitions and with a significant premium compared with the stock market prices prior to the announcement of the Offer;progress over time and the achievement of the objectives set out in the Business Plan could result  all other things being equal  in a significant increase in Share value. Minority Shareholders who do not wish to tender their shares to the Offer will  however  remain exposed to risks that could also have a downward impact on Share value;after discussions with the Independent Expert and the Ad Hoc Committee  the Offeror has waived its request regarding the squeeze-out procedure  a decision that underlines our fairness opinion which is given in these circumstances;Minority Shareholders may choose to tender their shares to the Offer or remain shareholders of the Company.The Related Agreements and Transactions have no impact on our assessment of the Offer Price fairness (§ 5).We have responded to the comments made orally and by e-mail by a minority shareholder (§6).8. ConclusionIn the light of all the elements of assessment described in our summary (§ 7)  and following our valuation of the Share  we are in a position to conclude that the terms of the Offer are fair  from a financial point of view  to the Shareholders voluntarily tendering their shares to the Offer.We have not identified any provisions in the Related Agreements and Transactions that might be prejudicial to the interests of the Shareholders whose securities are targeted by the Offer.”8.

On a reported basis  sales were down -22.9%  including a negative currency effect of -3.7%  due primarily to trends in the renminbi and the US dollar.This performance includes a nearly flat sales performance in Q4 2023-24 in organic terms (-0.7%)  representing a +14.3% rise compared to Q4 2019-20.In FY 2023-24  APAC and EMEA regions grew by +2.0% and +0.7%  respectively  demonstrating resilience in the face of soft consumer trends. Following a decline in shipments in Europe and China in Q3  the Group successfully normalized stocks in Q4. By contrast  sales in the Americas fell -39.6%  reflecting continued major destocking in an environment marked by inflation  more intense promotions  and strong post-Covid normalization of consumption.Breakdown of sales by division:€m (April 2023 – March 2024) FY 2023-24 FY 2022-23 Change as reported Organic change vs. FY 2022-23 vs. FY 2019-20 Cognac 778.6 1 100.0 -29.2% -25.1% +5.8 % Liqueurs & Spirits 387.8 418.9 -7.4% -4.6% +47.4 % Subtotal: Group Brands 1 166.5 1 518.9 -23.2% -19.4% +16.6 % Partner Brands 27.7 29.6 -6.6% -6.1% +2.3 % Total 1 194.1 1 548.5 -22.9% -19.2% +16.2 %CognacThe Cognac division saw Q4 sales rise +15.4% on an organic basis  driven by a significant increase in China and  to a lesser extent  growth in the EMEA region.In the United States  sales were once again penalized by an adverse environment and an intensely promotional market. In this context  the Group faced continued deterioration in value depletions2 and pursued destocking while maintaining a firm pricing policy in keeping with its strategy of long-term value.In China  the Group reported significant growth in a persistently complex market. This excellent performance reflected positive phasing effects and resilient underlying demand driven by the success of the Rémy Martin CLUB brand and numerous marketing and communications initiatives aimed at boosting sales during the Chinese New Year. Major destocking carried out ahead of the Chinese New Year allowed the Group to end the year with inventories at a healthy level.The EMEA region turned in a strong performance driven by good momentum in the Africa/Middle East region and in Western Europe.Liqueurs & SpiritsFourth-quarter sales of the Liqueurs & Spirits division fell back by -27.0% on an organic basis  hit by negative phasing effects in the United States  where the Group deliberately opted to complete most of its shipments in the third quarter. Underlying demand remained resilient despite a tough market and high basis of comparison.At the same time  the EMEA region reported a steep improvement in sales backed by trends all of its geographies in a market slowed by inflation and facing stepped-up promotional activity.Lastly  the APAC region recorded a decline in sales that reflected a slowdown in whisky sales in China.Partner BrandsSales of Partner Brands eased by -1.1% on an organic basis in the fourth quarter  hit by adverse trends in the Benelux countries.2023-24 full-year COP margin guidance confirmedIn 2023-24 Rémy Cointreau protected its profitability and investment capacity through tight cost controls  while continuing to roll out its medium-term plan.

The Group’s management considers that these indicators provide users of the financial statements with useful additional information to help them understand its performance. These indicators should be considered as supplementing those including in the consolidated financial statements and resulting movements.Organic sales growth:Organic growth excludes the impact of exchange rate fluctuations  acquisitions and disposals.The impact of exchange rate fluctuations is calculated by converting sales for the current financial year using average exchange rates from the prior financial year.For current-year acquisitions  sales of acquired entities are not included in organic growth calculations. For prior-year acquisitions  sales of acquired entities are included in the previous financial year but are only included in current-year organic growth with effect from the actual date of acquisition.For significant disposals  data is post-application of IFRS 5 (which reclassifies entities disposed of under “Net earnings from discontinued operations” for the current and prior financial year). It thus focuses on Group performance common to both financial years  over which local management has more direct influence.___________________________________1 All references to “on an organic basis” in this press release refer to sales growth at constant currency and consolidation scope2 Wholesalers’ sales to retailersView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240425227579/en/,neutral,0.01,0.98,0.0,mixed,0.23,0.27,0.5,True,English,"['Rémy Cointreau', 'FY 2023-24 sales', 'organic basis', 'Rémy Martin CLUB brand', '2023-24 full-year COP margin guidance', '2023-24 COP margin guidance', '2019-20 level Cost-cutting plan', 'complex market United States', 'Rémy Cointreau', 'COP margin objective', 'positive phasing effects', 'negative phasing effects', 'negative currency effect', 'firm pricing policy', 'tight cost controls', 'uncompromising pricing policy', 'other operating costs', 'unfavourable exchange rates', 'Current Operating Profit', 'major cost-cutting plan', 'strong post-Covid normalization', 'Africa/Middle East region', 'Chinese New Year', 'soft consumer trends', 'resilient underlying demand', 'cost savings 2023-24', 'Strong sequential improvement', 'contrasting market trends', 'The EMEA region', 'flat sales performance', 'The Cognac division', 'gross margin', 'full-year sales', 'healthy level', 'medium-term plan', 'strong performance', 'promotional market', 'tough market', 'steep improvement', '2023-24 sales', 'Travel Retail', 'strong rise', 'Regulatory News', 'organic basis1', 'US dollar', 'organic terms', 'EMEA regions', 'intense promotions', 'Partner Brands', 'significant increase', 'lesser extent', 'continued deterioration', 'value depletions2', 'long-term value', 'excellent performance', 'communications initiatives', 'good momentum', 'third quarter', 'promotional activity', 'fourth quarter', 'adverse trends', 'Benelux countries', 'investment capacity', 'communications spend', 'first half', 'exceptional experiences', 'wide range', 'exacting standards', 'honed skills', 'The Group', 'APAC region', 'major destocking', 'high basis', 'significant growth', 'adverse environment', 'inflationary environment', 'good resilience', 'Organic change', 'numerous marketing', 'Western Europe', 'Fourth-quarter sales', 'same time', 'whisky sales', 'organic decrease', 'Spirits division', 'Group Brands', 'Q4 sales', '+14.3% rise', 'Q4.', 'China', 'Paris', 'RCO', 'renminbi', 'FY', 'face', 'decline', 'shipments', 'stocks', 'Americas', 'consumption', 'Breakdown', 'April', 'March', 'Liqueurs', 'Subtotal', 'context', 'strategy', 'success', 'inventories', 'geographies', 'slowdown', 'profitability', 'strict', 'result', 'deployment', 'world', 'clients', 'terroirs', 'variety', 'flavors', 'expertise', 'generation', 'products', 'tribute']",2024-04-26,2024-04-27,marketscreener.com

Summary of activity Cofinimmo has been acquiring  developing and managing rental properties for 40 years. Responding to societal changes  Cofinimmo's permanent objective is to offer high-quality care  living and working spaces ('Caring  Living and Working - Together in Real Estate'). Capitalising on its expertise  Cofinimmo consolidates its leadership in European healthcare real estate. The pandemic that the world has been experiencing in recent years has highlighted the importance of the healthcare segment for each and every one of us. Through its investments  Cofinimmo is actively participating in the operation  maintenance  expansion and renewal of the healthcare property portfolio in nine countries. During the first quarter  Cofinimmo made several investments (for 30 million EUR)  mainly in various healthcare real estate sub-segments in Europe. Thanks to these operations  healthcare real estate assets (4.6 billion EUR) account for 75% of the group's consolidated portfolio as at 31.03.2024  which reaches 6.2 billion EUR. Cofinimmo constantly evaluates its assets portfolio based on the key points of its strategy and the available market opportunities. In this context  the group carried out disposals for more than 30 million EUR  contributing to the reduction by 0.3% of the debt-to-assets ratio. These are noticeable in the three sectors of activity. Consequently  Cofinimmo has balanced investments and divestments in the first quarter (1 million EUR net investment  with a neutral impact on the debt-to-assets ratio). Cofinimmo has been adopting a proactive ESG policy for more than 15 years. This is a real priority for the group  which once again distinguished itself in 2024. Several ESG labels previously granted have been renewed or improved (Equileap  Carbon Disclosure Project). As a result  Cofinimmo has been recognised as the #1 company in Belgium in terms of gender equality by Equileap. Moreover  Cofinimo was granted several new BREEAM certifications in healthcare real estate in Spain. On 25.04.2024  Cofinimmo's ESG efforts were praised again by the international financial press (Financial Times)  with the group being the only real estate company  among 10 Belgian groups  listed in the 600 Europe's Climate Leaders 2024. In terms of financing  Cofinimmo reinforced its financial resources and its balance sheet structure during the previous financial years (cumulative capital increases of 565 million EUR in 2021  114 million EUR in 2022  and 247 million EUR in 2023). The financing operations during this period enabled the group to improve the maturity timetable of its financial debts  to increase the amount of available financing  and to maintain an average cost of debt* at particularly low levels. As a result  the only remaining financing to be repaid in 2024 is the 55 million EUR Green & Social Bond 2016-2024  maturing next December. Since this loan was contracted on favourable terms  it will be held until maturity. As at 31.03.2024  Cofinimmo had close to one billion EUR of headroom on committed credit lines  after deduction of the backup of the commercial paper programme. In addition  the interest rate risk is fully hedged as at 31.03.2024 as part of the long-term interest rate hedging policy. The group's momentum in terms of investments  divestments and financing (average cost of debt* at 1.4%)  coupled with efficient management of the existing portfolio in transformation (occupancy rate of 98.4%  gross rental income up 2.2% on a like-for-like basis* thanks to recent indexations  which usually take place on the anniversary date of the contract  operating margin* at 82.0%)  enabled the company to realise a net result from core activities - group share* of 55 million EUR as at 31.03.2024  (compared to the 53 million EUR that were made as at 31.03.2023  i.e. a 2% increase). This was mainly due to the investments made  higher than the effect of divestments  as well as the positive effect of contracts indexation. The net result from core 4PRESS RELEASE REGULATED INFORMATION Brussels  26.04.2024  7:30 a.m. CET activities - group share - per share* amounts to 1.49 EUR (in line with the outlook1  compared to 1.62 EUR as at 31.03.2023)  taking into account the issuance of shares in 2023. The effect of divestments and capital increases on this indicator is -0.12 EUR per share and -0.18 EUR per share respectively  i.e. -0.30 EUR per share in total over the first three months of the 2024 financial year. The net result - group share amounts to 17 million EUR (i.e. 0.48 EUR per share) as at 31.03.2024  compared to 17 million EUR (i.e. 0.53 EUR per share) as at 31.03.2023. This stability is due to the fact that the increase in the net result from core activities - group share* is offset by the net impact of the change in the fair value of hedging instruments and investment properties - non-cash items - between the first three months of 2023 and the first three months of 2024. With a debt-to-assets ratio of 43.1% as at 31.03.2024 (compared to 43.8% as at 31.12.2023)  Cofinimmo's consolidated balance sheet (whose BBB/Stable/A-2 rating was confirmed on 18.03.2024) shows a strong solvency (information on main risks and uncertainties are stated in section 14). Based on the information currently available and the assumptions detailed in section 12.1 below (320 million EUR gross investments and 270 million EUR divestments in 2024  with these net investments having a near neutral effect on the debt-to-assets ratio)  Cofinimmo confirms the guidance published in the press release dated 23.02.2024 which provided  barring major unforeseen events  to achieve a net result from core activities - group share* of 6.40 EUR per share for the 2024 financial year  taking into account the prorata temporis dilutive effects of the capital increases carried out in 2023 (approximately 0.50 EUR per share) and the divestments carried out in 2023 and budgeted in 2024 (approximately 0.40 EUR per share). Based on the same data and assumptions  the debt-to-assets ratio would remain nearly stable at approximately 44% as at 31.12.2024. This ratio does not take into account possible additional changes in the fair value of investment properties (which will be determined by the independent real estate valuers). These items (provided subject to the main risks and uncertainties stated  see section 14 below) allow to confirm the outlook for the gross dividend (6.20 EUR per share for the 2024 financial year  payable in 2025)  subject to the evolution of the net result from core activities - group share - per share* and the evolution of the debt-to-assets ratio. 1 i.e. the quarterly outlook derived from the annual outlook presented in the 2023 universal registration document  published on 05.04.2024. 5PRESS RELEASE REGULATED INFORMATION Brussels  26.04.2024  7:30 a.m. CET 2.
