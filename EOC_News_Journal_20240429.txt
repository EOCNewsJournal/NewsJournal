40061,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rt.com/russia/596731-motherland-not-for-sale-moscow/,‘Motherland is not for sale’ – Moscow,Russia is not considering ceding any territory in order to recover its frozen assets  Maria Zakharova has said Read Full Article at RT.com,Russia will not allow its assets frozen by the West to be used as a bargaining chip  Maria Zakharova has saidRussia will not cede any territory in exchange for the prospect of recovering its assets frozen abroad  Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Telegram on Sunday. Zakharova was commenting on a Wall Street Journal article claiming that Germany is considering trying to use the funds as leverage during potential peace talks between Moscow and Kiev.Berlin has been opposing the US push to seize the frozen Russian assets and use them to fund Ukraine’s military and economic needs  according to the article  which was published on Sunday. One of the arguments reportedly brought up by German officials revolved around using the money as “leverage in any talks to end the war.” That strategy would supposedly force Moscow to “cede” some of the territory that Kiev lays claim to  the WSJ said.The outlet did not provide any exact quotes or identify any specific German officials supporting this line of thought.“I do not know who says what but assets are not to be exchanged for territories ” Zakharova wrote in a Telegram post. “The motherland is not for sale.”Zakharova also maintained that the Russian assets should “stay untouched” and warned that “any Western theft would be met with a harsh response.” “Many people in the West have already understood this. It’s a pity that not everyone [has] ” she added.The EU and other G7 nations have blocked an estimated $300 billion in reserves belonging to the Russian central bank since the start of the Ukraine conflict in 2022. Most of the funds are being held by the Belgium-based clearinghouse Euroclear.Earlier in April  the US passed a bill allowing Washington to liquidate frozen Russian assets and transfer the funds obtained to Ukraine. However  the US holds only around $6 billion out of the total amount. Washington has long been pushing its allies to seize the money outright but has encountered resistance from some allies  particularly Germany  according to the WSJ.The potential use of the funds as a bargaining chip in future talks is just one of Berlin’s reasons  though  according to the WSJ. Germany is mostly concerned about the move potentially opening a Pandora’s box of historical restitution and reparations claims  including those linked to the nation’s own Nazi past  it said.Berlin is currently facing such demands from Poland  which has been seeking $1.3 trillion in compensation since 2022. Greece asked for over $300 billion in 2019  while in Italy courts even reportedly attempted to seize German state property to fund paying compensation to the descendants of victims of the Nazi occupation.The German government has so far brushed off those demands  arguing that “international law prohibits individuals from making claims against states in foreign courts and that state assets are immune from seizure ” the WSJ said. Seizing Russia’s money would violate this principle and greatly undermine Berlin’s legal position  it added.Similar concerns are also reportedly driving Japan’s opposition to seizing the assets  since it also faces reparation claims from South Korea and other neighbors  the outlet reported. Tokyo and Berlin should also not be the only ones to worry since the move could open a way for other nations to claim reparations for slavery and colonialism  according to the WSJ.,neutral,0.02,0.82,0.16,negative,0.02,0.26,0.72,True,English,"['Motherland', 'sale', 'Moscow', 'Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova', 'Wall Street Journal article', 'Russian central bank', 'specific German officials', 'German state property', 'other G7 nations', 'potential peace talks', 'frozen Russian assets', 'foreign courts', 'other nations', 'potential use', 'German government', 'other neighbors', 'state assets', 'bargaining chip', 'economic needs', 'exact quotes', 'Western theft', 'harsh response', 'Many people', 'Belgium-based clearinghouse', 'total amount', 'future talks', 'historical restitution', 'Nazi past', 'Nazi occupation', 'international law', 'legal position', 'Similar concerns', 'South Korea', 'reparation claims', 'Telegram post', 'US push', 'Ukraine conflict', 'reparations claims', 'territory', 'exchange', 'prospect', 'Sunday', 'Germany', 'funds', 'leverage', 'Moscow', 'Kiev', 'Berlin', 'military', 'arguments', 'money', 'war', 'strategy', 'WSJ', 'outlet', 'line', 'thought', 'territories', 'motherland', 'sale', 'pity', 'everyone', 'EU', 'reserves', 'start', 'April', 'bill', 'Washington', 'allies', 'resistance', 'reasons', 'move', 'Pandora', 'box', 'demands', 'Poland', 'compensation', 'Greece', 'Italy', 'descendants', 'victims', 'individuals', 'states', 'seizure', 'principle', 'Japan', 'opposition', 'Tokyo', 'way', 'slavery', 'colonialism']",2024-04-28,2024-04-29,rt.com

A specialized company would likely issue bonds backed by future interest rates and pay proceeds to Ukraine  Reuters points out.Video of day“It will help  but it will not be a game changer  as it will be able to finance Ukraine for less than six months "" Reuters wrote.""But if Kyiv will get $320 billion  that will be a different matter. This will allow to finance war at least until the end of 2028.""If the war ends by 2028  this money can be used to rebuild Ukraine  which estimatedly will cost $486 billion  World Bank reported.At the same time  only $5 billion of Russian assets are in the United States  bulk of thier frozen money is kept in EU  which has legal doubts about their confiscation.Struggle over Russian assetsUS Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved a bill that would help to confiscate Russian assets and transfer them to Ukraine to rebuild its infrastructure on Jan. 24Prior to that  US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that his country  together with EU  was considering legal authority to direct $300 billion in Russian assets to Ukraine's reconstruction and other needs.Read also: PACE backs directing frozen Russian assets to UkrainePresident of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that outlines of decisions necessary to transfer frozen Russian assets to Ukraine are already being prepared.Bill No. 8038 on transfer of frozen Russian assets to Ukraine received the required number of votes to be passed by US House of Representatives on April 20.Ukraine may receive almost eight billion dollars as part of this procedure.
