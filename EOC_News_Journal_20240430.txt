Any person subsequently offering  selling or recommending the Notes (a ""distributor"") should take into consideration the target market assessment; however  a distributor subject to Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended  ""MiFID II"") is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels.

Consequently  no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended  the ""PRIIPs Regulation"") for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation.

This Prospectus and any Final Terms do not constitute an offer or an invitation by or on behalf of the Issuers or the Dealer(s) to any person to subscribe for or to purchase any Notes. Each potential investor in Notes must determine the suitability of that investment in light of its own circumstances. In particular  each potential investor should: have sufficient knowledge and experience to make a meaningful evaluation of the relevant Notes  the merits and risks of investing in the relevant Notes and the information contained or incorporated by reference into this Prospectus or any applicable supplement hereto; have access to  and knowledge of  appropriate analytical tools to evaluate  in the context of its particular financial situation and the investment(s) it is considering  an investment in the Notes and the impact the Notes will have on its overall investment portfolio; have sufficient financial resources and liquidity to bear all of the risks of an investment in the relevant Notes  including where principal or interest is payable in one or more currencies  or where the currency for principal or interest payments is different from the potential investor's currency; understand thoroughly the terms of the relevant Notes and be familiar with the behaviour of any relevant indices and financial markets; and be able to evaluate (either alone or with the help of a financial adviser) possible scenarios for economic  interest rate and other factors that may affect its investment and its ability to bear the applicable risks.

Alternative Performance Measures Certain financial measures presented in this Prospectus and in the documents incorporated by reference are not recognised financial measures under International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (""IFRS"") or any other generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP"") (""Alternative Performance Measures"") and may therefore not be considered as an alternative to the financial measures defined in the accounting standards in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The Alternative Performance Measures are intended to supplement investors' understanding of the Issuers financial information by providing measures which investors  financial analysts and management use to help evaluate the Issuers financial leverage and operating performance. Special items which the Issuers do not believe to be indicative of ongoing business performance are excluded from these calculations so that investors can better evaluate and analyse historical and future business trends on a consistent basis. Definitions of these Alternative Performance Measures may not be comparable to similar definitions used by other companies and are not a substitute for similar measures according to IFRS or GAAP.5 Forward-Looking Statements This Prospectus contains certain forward-looking statements. A forward-looking statement is a statement that does not relate to historical facts and events.

We made significant progress in developing Euroclear FundsPlace by teaming up with new partners such as iCapital or Spuerkeess and making a strategic investment in blockchain-based funds marketplace IZNES. Providing access to a wide range of funds services  Euroclear FundsPlace delivers risk-mitigation  automation and efficiency at scale to a growing number of clients.In this first quarter of 2024  the Russian sanctions and countermeasures continued to have a material impact on our operations. We are closely following the discussions at EU level about the use of profits generated by the Russian immobilised assets. Our teams continue to respond well to this unprecedented situation and remain focused on minimising the legal  operational  financial and reputational risks for our company and our clients while maintaining normal business operations.As Valérie Urbain is now taking over as CEO of Euroclear  I feel proud and honoured to have been able to lead Euroclear's growth journey and further reinforce our position as trusted financial market infrastructure. The dedication of our colleagues across all locations  the support of all Euroclear stakeholders – including the Board  our shareholders  customers and partners – have been critical to our success. I am very grateful to everyone involved and will keep Euroclear close to my heart. I know that I leave the company in safe and capable hands.""Business performanceThe key operating metrics (end of period unless stated otherwise) demonstrate a strong business performance during the period.Q1 2023 Q1 2024 YoY evolution 3-year CAGR Assets under custody €36.6 trillion €39.1 trillion +7 % +4.6 % Number of transactions 79.1 million 80.6 million +2 % 1.9 % Turnover €281 trillion €274 trillion -3 % +4.7 % Fund assets under custody €2.9 trillion €3.3 trillion +13 % +6.5 % Collateral Highway €1.75 trillion €1.8 trillion +3 % +2.6 % Underlying cash deposits (average) €25.1 billion €22.3 billion -11 % +2.3 %With the continued increase in equity market valuations coupled with robust results in fixed income  assets under custody have reached a new record at €39.1 trillion (+7%)  growing for the sixth quarter in a row.Funds assets under custody were boosted by ETF growth and higher stock markets valuations and reached an all-time record level.The Collateral Highway outstanding progressively recovered thanks to favourable market conditions characterised by the stabilisation of monetary policy and the prospect of lower interest rates in the coming quarters.Milestones in global funds strategyThe first quarter of 2024 was marked by a number of achievements in developing Euroclear's funds business  a key pilar in the company's strategy. Euroclear FundsPlace offers fund management companies  banks  institutional investors and custodians a single point of access to more than 250 000 funds.In Q1 2024  Euroclear acquired a stake in IZNES  a pan-European funds marketplace based on blockchain technology[1]. Through this strategic partnership  Euroclear will complement its funds services on the French market and beyond and continue to support the development of innovative funds distribution models.Banque et Caisse d'Epargne de l'Etat Luxembourg (Spuerkeess) has announced in February 2024 that it will be moving the majority of its fund portfolio to Euroclear FundsPlace in order to centralise the distribution and execution services of its funds. Euroclear's funds platform will manage the lion's share of Spuerkeess' portfolio from now on and collect trailer fees on external custodians as well.Euroclear also announced a partnership with global fintech platform iCapital. Euroclear's clients will gain enhanced access to a broader range of alternative investments  including private equity  private credit  real estate  infrastructure  and hedge funds. The iCapital funds available on iCapital Marketplace will complement and expand Euroclear FundsPlace's current offerings.Euroclear hosted its first major funds-dedicated conference – Euroclear FundsCo – in London on 26 March. This inaugural Euroclear funds event brought together more than 200 senior representatives from across the funds industry to discuss future global trends.Euroclear's open architecture helps streamline collateral management Euroclear's international Central Securities Depository  Euroclear Bank  has become an eligible securities collateral location of Eurex Clearing AG. Through this partnership  clients of Euroclear Bank and Eurex Clearing will be able to post collateral directly to Eurex Clearing with the ability to further optimise the pool of collateral held in Euroclear Bank. The service offering increases operational efficiency for market participants and streamlines the collateral management process. Eurex Clearing already uses Euroclear Bank as an eligible securities settlement location.Russian sanctionsFinancial impacts of the Russian assets in Q1 2024The Russian sanctions and countermeasures continue to have a significant impact on Euroclear's earnings  as €1.6 billion of the €1.9 billion interest income relate to Russian sanctioned assets.The sanctions and Russian countermeasures resulted in direct costs of €17 million and a loss of business income of €6 million.Euroclear's net profit related to the Central Bank of Russia's (CBR) immobilised assets as from 15 February amounts to €557 million and will be reported and retained separately.Euroclear Holding(€ m) Q1 2023 o/w Russiansanctionsimpacts Q1 2024 o/w Russiansanctionsimpacts o/wCBR asfrom 15 Feb Operating income 1 380 729 2 289 1 583 746 Business income 409 -5 416 -6 0 Interest  banking & other income 971 734 1 872 1 589 746 Operating expenses -315 -9 -338 -17 -3 Operating profit before Impairment 1 065 720 1 951 1 566 742 Impairment -2 -1 -2 0 0 Pre-tax profit 1 063 720 1 949 1 566 742 Tax -267 -180 -485 -391 -186 Net profit 796 540 1 463 1 174 557Update on Russian sanctions and countermeasuresRussia's invasion of Ukraine resulted in market-wide application of international sanctions. Euroclear considers the application of international sanctions as a key priority. Therefore  well established processes are in place which have allowed the group to implement the sanctions while maintaining our normal course of business.As a result of the sanctions  blocked coupon payments and redemptions owed to sanctioned entities continue to accumulate on Euroclear Bank's balance sheet. At the end of Q1 2024  Euroclear Bank's balance sheet totalled €199 billion  of which €159 billion relate to sanctioned Russian assets.In line with Euroclear's Risk Appetite and Policies and as expected by the EU Capital Requirements Regulation  Euroclear's cash balances are re-invested to minimise risk and capital requirements. In the first quarter of 2024  interest arising on cash balances from Russian-sanctioned assets was approximately €1.6 billion. Such interest earnings are driven by the prevailing interest rates and the amount of cash balances that Euroclear is required to invest. Subject to Belgian corporate tax  these earnings generated almost €400 million tax revenue for the Belgian State. As such  future earnings will be influenced by the evolving interest rate environment.Effective 15 February 2024  the EU Council adopted a Regulation[2] providing for an obligation for Central Securities Depositories holding reserves and assets of the Central Bank of Russia[3] to apply specific rules in relation to the cash balances accumulating due to restrictive measures. These central securities depositories  including Euroclear  should account for and manage such extraordinary cash balances separately from their other activities  should keep separate the net profit generated and should not dispose of these ensuing net profits (e.g. in the form of dividends to shareholders). Euroclear has since the imposition of sanctions reported the profitability separately and now  in addition  Euroclear is reporting separately the profitability related to the Central Bank of Russia's immobilised assets as from 15 February 2024 – as disclosed in the table above.Euroclear continues to act prudently and to further strengthen its capital by retaining Russian sanction related profits as a buffer against current and future risks. There are still many unknown risks given the current external climate and how it could evolve.Various parties in Russia contest the consequences of the application of sanctions  with a significant number of legal proceedings ongoing  almost exclusively in Russian courts. The impact of the lawsuits on Euroclear is uncertain but the probability of unfavourable rulings is high since Russia does not recognise the international sanctions. Euroclear will continue to defend itself against all legal claims.Euroclear notes that various options to use profits generated by sanctioned amounts held by financial institutions  including Euroclear  for the financing of Ukraine are being considered. Euroclear is focused on minimising potential legal  financial and operational risks that may arise for itself and its clients from the implementation of any proposals made or measures taken  while complying with its obligations.AnnexesInfographic - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2401629/Euroclear1_Infographic.jpgEuroclear Bank and Euroclear Investments are the two group issuing entities.

PRIIPs REGULATION / IMPORTANT - EEA RETAIL INVESTORS - If the Final Terms in respect of any Notes include a legend entitled ""PROHIBITION OF SALES TO EEA RETAIL INVESTORS""  the Notes are not intended to be offered  sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered  sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (""EEA""). For these purposes  a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive 2016/97/EU  as amended  where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Regulation. Consequently  no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended  the ""PRIIPs Regulation"") for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation. UK PRIIPs REGULATION / IMPORTANT - UK RETAIL INVESTORS - If the Final Terms in respect of any Notes include a legend entitled ""PROHIBITION OF SALES TO UK RETAIL INVESTORS""  the Notes are not intended to be offered  sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered  sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (""UK""). For these purposes  a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client  as defined in point (8) of Article 2 of Regulation (EU) No 2017/565 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (""EUWA""); or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the provisions of the Financial Services and Markets Authority (""FSMA"") and any rules or regulations made under the FSMA to implement Directive (EU) 2016/97  as amended  where that customer would not qualify as a professional client  as defined in point (8) of Article 2(1) of Regulation (EU) No 600/2014 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the EUWA; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in Article 2 of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 as it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the EUWA.

The Alternative Performance Measures are intended to supplement investors' understanding of the Issuers financial information by providing measures which investors  financial analysts and management use to help evaluate the Issuers financial leverage and operating performance. Special items which the Issuers do not believe to be indicative of ongoing business performance are excluded from these calculations so that investors can better evaluate and analyse historical and future business trends on a consistent basis. Definitions of these Alternative Performance Measures may not be comparable to similar definitions used by other companies and are not a substitute for similar measures according to IFRS or GAAP.5 Forward-Looking Statements This Prospectus contains certain forward-looking statements. A forward-looking statement is a statement that does not relate to historical facts and events. They are based on analyses or forecasts of future results and estimates of amounts not yet determinable or foreseeable.

This applies  in particular  to statements in this Prospectus containing information on future earning capacity  plans and expectations regarding RWE Group's business and management  its growth and profitability  and general economic and regulatory conditions and other factors that affect it. Forward-looking statements in this Prospectus are based on current estimates and assumptions that the Issuers make to the best of their present knowledge. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks  uncertainties and other factors which could cause actual results  including RWE Group's financial condition and results of operations  to differ materially from and be worse than results that have expressly or implicitly been assumed or described in these forward-looking statements. RWE Group's business is also subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause a forward-looking statement  estimate or prediction in this Prospectus to become inaccurate. Accordingly  investors are strongly advised to read the following sections of this Prospectus: ""Risk Factors""  ""RWE Aktiengesellschaft and RWE Group"" and ""RWE Finance Europe B.V."". These sections include more detailed descriptions of factors that might have an impact on RWE Group's business and the markets in which it operates.

Notes may be issued on a continuing basis to one or more of the Dealers and any additional Dealer appointed under the Programme from time to time by the Issuers  which appointment may be for a specific issue or on an ongoing basis. Notes may be distributed by way of public offer or private placements and  in each case  on a syndicated or non-syndicated basis. The method of distribution of each tranche (""Tranche"") will be stated in the relevant final terms (the ""Final Terms""). Notes may be offered to qualified and non-qualified investors  including with the restrictions specified in the ""PROHIBITION OF SALES TO EEA RETAIL INVESTORS"" and/or the ""PROHIBITION OF SALES TO UK RETAIL INVESTORS"" legends set out on the cover page of the applicable Final Terms  if any.

One or more Tranches  which are expressed to be consolidated and forming a single series and identical in all respects  but having different issue dates  interest commencement dates  issue prices and dates for first interest payments may form a series (""Series"") of Notes. Further Notes may be issued as part of existing Series. Notes will be issued in such denominations as may be agreed between the relevant Issuer and the relevant Dealer(s) and as indicated in the applicable Final Terms save that the minimum denomination of the Notes will be  if in euro  € 1 000  and  if in any currency other than euro  an amount in such other currency nearly equivalent to € 1 000 at the time of the issue of the Notes. Subject to any applicable legal or regulatory restrictions and requirements of relevant central banks  Notes may be issued in euro or any other currency. The Notes will be freely transferable. Notes will be issued with a maturity of twelve months or more. Notes may be issued at an issue price which is at par or at a discount to  or premium over  par  as stated in the relevant Final Terms. The issue price for Notes to be issued will be determined at the time of pricing on the basis of a yield which will be determined on the basis of the orders of the investors which are received by the Dealers during the offer period. Orders will specify a minimum yield and may only be confirmed at or above such yield. The resulting yield will be used to determine an issue price  all to correspond to the yield. The yield for Notes with fixed interest rates will be calculated by the use of the International Capital Markets Association (""ICMA"") method  which determines the effective interest rate of notes taking into account accrued interest on a daily basis.

40077,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://www.pionline.com/money-management/stocks-trade-390-minutes-day-increasingly-only-10-matter,Stocks trade for 390 minutes a day. Increasingly  only 10 matter.,The regular market for U.S. equities runs for 390 minutes on a standard trading day. But at the rate things are going  eventually the last 10 might be the only ones that matter.,"The regular market for U.S. equities runs for 390 minutes on a standard trading day. But at the rate things are going  eventually the last 10 might be the only ones that matter.About a third of all S&P 500 stock trades are now executed in the final 10 minutes of the session  according to data compiled by BestEx Research  a developer of trading algorithms. That’s up from 27% in 2021.Now fresh evidence emerging from Europe — where the pattern is similar — suggests the trend may be hurting liquidity and distorting prices.It’s new ammo for critics of the global boom in passive investing  because index funds drive the phenomenon. These products typically buy and sell shares at the close  since the last prices of the day are used to set the benchmarks they aim to replicate.Assets in passive equity funds have surged over the past decade to more than $11.5 trillion in the U.S. alone  according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence  shifting ever-more trading to the end of the session. Active players seeking to take advantage of that liquidity have followed  creating a self-reinforcing cycle.The closing auction in Europe  which occurs after the end of regular trading  now accounts for 28% of volumes on public venues  up from 23% four years ago  data from Bloomberg Intelligence and analytics firm big xyt show.“The common knowledge is that closing auctions are very  very good mechanisms to close markets ” said Benjamin Clapham at Goethe University Frankfurt  co-author of a new research paper titled ""Shifting Volumes to the Close: Consequences for Price Discovery and Market Quality."" “This might be true  but if we have such a shift of volumes to this very last opportunity of trading in the day  we might see price inefficiencies.”The paper  which Clapham wrote with colleague Micha Bender and Deutsche Bundesbank researcher Benedikt Schwemmlein  focused on large-caps on the London  Paris and Frankfurt exchanges in the four years through mid-2023. The trio found shares generally move between the end of continuous trading and the last price set in the closing auction  yet 14% of that move reverses overnight — a sign it’s fueled by one-sided flows rather than fundamentals.The new research echoes earlier studies  including in the U.S.  where a 2023 paper also argued that moves seen during the auction revert overnight as a result of the liquidity dynamic.The charge is one of a number leveled against passive investing  including that it can blindly inflate company valuations and wreak havoc when major indexes rebalance  triggering billions in one-way trades. The litany of concerns has inspired high-profile attacks from critics such as Elon Musk  and more recently Greenlight Capital’s David Einhorn.But the extent to which any closing distortions should cause concern is uncertain and  as with so much in the modern market  the debate isn’t clear cut.For Hitesh Mittal  BestEx Research’s founder  the overnight reversion is part of normal market function. Passive funds may be buying at fractionally higher prices at the close  but he reckons the cost is “way  way less” than liquidity providers would charge for transactions of their size in thinner liquidity earlier in the day.In the U.S.  the mechanism to determine closing prices runs alongside the last minutes of continuous trading. Nearly 10% of all US shares were traded in that closing auction last month  nearing previous 2019 highs after dipping in the retail trading frenzy  data compiled by Rosenblatt Securities show.Chuck Mack  head of strategy for North American trading services for Nasdaq  said market participants like the transparent price discovery and “depth of liquidity” in closing auctions. He said U.S. intraday liquidity is affected more by the growing fragmentation of stocks trading on different platforms.Meanwhile  two other researchers — Carole Comerton-Forde at the University of Melbourne and Barbara Rindi at Bocconi University — concluded in 2022 that ostensible European reversals might be due to noise at the market open  rather than distortions  and that intraday liquidity hasn’t been hurt by the closing auction. Writing on behalf of the duo  Comerton-Forde said regulators don’t have cause for concern yet  “but should continue to watch this space in case things change.”The London Stock Exchange didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for Euronext acknowledged that price reversions occur in the wake of indexes rebalancing  but said “observed reversals are typically modest  and market overreactions are common after significant liquidity events.”A Deutsche Börse spokesperson said that while there were different views among market participants  closing auctions were generally not seen as a problem.In the U.S.  even as volumes shift to the end of day  the growing role of retail investors has prompted a number of brokerages like Robinhood to offer 24-hour trading of some securities to give them maximum opportunity to buy and sell. Yet for institutional pros  it’s increasingly all about those last few minutes.“When I do speak to clients who are trading portfolios that are more sensitized to these changes in liquidity  they will definitely wait ” said Mark Montgomery  head of business development at big xyt. “As the liquidity decreases in the continuous part of the day  the potential for them to leak information about their intent is far greater.”",neutral,0.01,0.98,0.01,negative,0.03,0.18,0.78,True,English,"['Stocks', '390 minutes', 'Deutsche Bundesbank researcher Benedikt Schwemmlein', 'A Deutsche Börse spokesperson', 'North American trading services', 'The London Stock Exchange', 'S&P 500 stock trades', 'U.S. intraday liquidity', 'colleague Micha Bender', 'two other researchers', 'ostensible European reversals', 'U.S. equities', 'normal market function', 'retail trading frenzy', 'Rosenblatt Securities show', 'significant liquidity events', 'transparent price discovery', 'passive equity funds', 'Goethe University Frankfurt', 'standard trading day', 'new research paper', 'one-way trades', 'Passive funds', 'trading algorithms', 'regular trading', 'Frankfurt exchanges', 'continuous trading', 'observed reversals', 'retail investors', '24-hour trading', 'new ammo', 'index funds', 'BestEx Research', 'passive investing', 'price inefficiencies', 'price reversions', 'regular market', 'fresh evidence', 'global boom', 'past decade', 'Bloomberg Intelligence', 'Active players', 'self-reinforcing cycle', 'public venues', 'analytics firm', 'big xyt', 'common knowledge', 'closing auctions', 'good mechanisms', 'Market Quality', 'four years', 'last price', 'one-sided flows', 'earlier studies', 'liquidity dynamic', 'company valuations', 'high-profile attacks', 'Elon Musk', 'Greenlight Capital', 'David Einhorn', 'modern market', 'clear cut', 'Hitesh Mittal', 'overnight reversion', 'liquidity providers', 'thinner liquidity', 'previous 2019 highs', 'Chuck Mack', 'market participants', 'growing fragmentation', 'different platforms', 'Barbara Rindi', 'Bocconi University', 'market overreactions', 'different views', 'growing role', 'maximum opportunity', 'institutional pros', 'last opportunity', 'higher prices', 'closing prices', 'final 10 minutes', 'Benjamin Clapham', 'major indexes', 'closing distortions', 'Carole Comerton-Forde', 'US shares', 'last minutes', '2023 paper', '390 minutes', 'rate', 'things', 'third', 'session', 'data', 'developer', 'pattern', 'trend', 'critics', 'phenomenon', 'products', 'close', 'benchmarks', 'Assets', 'advantage', 'volumes', 'markets', 'author', 'Consequences', 'shift', 'large-caps', 'Paris', 'mid-20', 'trio', 'move', 'fundamentals', 'result', 'charge', 'wreak', 'havoc', 'billions', 'litany', 'concerns', 'extent', 'debate', 'founder', 'cost', 'transactions', 'size', 'head', 'Nasdaq', 'depth', 'stocks', 'Melbourne', 'noise', 'behalf', 'duo', 'regulators', 'cause', 'space', 'case', 'request', 'comment', 'Euronext', 'wake', 'problem', 'number', 'brokerages', 'Robinhood', '27']",2024-04-30,2024-04-30,pionline.com

""Stock Grant Connect 4 Agile Growth 2027"" plan is a plan of incentive involving ordinary shares of Circle S.p.A. Afterwards  the Assembly discussed and resolved to adopt the stock grant plan named ""Stock Grant Connect 4 Agile Growth 2027"" (the ""Plan"") to be allocated to individuals who hold pivotal roles for the Company and the Group (the ""Beneficiaries "" whose identification is the responsibility of the Board of Directors). The Plan aims to strengthen the sharing of strategic objectives between the Company and its ""key"" resources  fostering increasing involvement  awareness  and coordination  as well as medium to long-term incentivization and retention. This plan unfolds over a three-year period and allows Beneficiaries to earn rights  each of which entitles them to receive  at no cost  one ordinary share of the Company  up to a maximum of a total of 120 000 shares  in proportion to the achievement of certain objectives related to Group growth. These objectives include factors such as profitability  growth of proprietary products and innovative projects  people engagement  and talent management  considering that for a highlyinnovative  international company that anticipates trends  the satisfaction and retention of key personnel are crucial elements. The allocation of rights to Beneficiaries will be carried out by the Company's Board of Directors in three tranches  all subject to the same vesting period  which will expire at the end of the three- year duration of the Plan (i.e.  June 30  2027). The ordinary shares of Circle  allocated to each Beneficiary under the Plan  will be subject to a 12-monthlock-up period starting from the respective allocation date. For further information about the Plan  reference is made to the regulation made available to the public through the storage mechanism of Borsa Italiana  on the Company's website at www.circlegroup.eu under the ""Investor Relations  Shareholders' Meetings"" section. Free capital increase pursuant to Article 2349 of the Italian Civil Code in support of the ""Stock Grant Connect 4 Agile Growth 2027"" Plan Furthermore  the extraordinary assembly resolved on a free capital increase  pursuant to and for the effects of article 2349 of the civil code and article 5 of the company's bylaws  on a divisible basis and to be executed in multiple tranches  by the final deadline of June 30  2027  for a maximum amount of nominal Euro 8 055  through the allocation to capital of a corresponding amount of the aforementioned reserves  with the issuance of a maximum of 120 000 ordinary shares without indication of nominal value  with regular entitlement  having the same characteristics as those in circulation  at an issuance value equal to the implicit book value of the company's shares  to be entirely allocated to share capital  to be allocated in support of the Plan. Therefore  the Plan  if satisfied through the execution of the free capital increase pursuant to article 2349 of the civil code  will have dilutive effects. In particular  if all 120 000 maximum shares are issued  the maximum dilution will be 2.9% (without taking into account any changes to share capital subsequent to the current date).

Increasingly  Only 10 Matter,(Bloomberg) -- The regular market for US equities runs for 390 minutes on a standard trading day. But at the rate things are going  eventually the last 10...,(Bloomberg) — The regular market for US equities runs for 390 minutes on a standard trading day. But at the rate things are going  eventually the last 10 might be the only ones that matter.Most Read from BloombergAbout a third of all S&P 500 stock trades are now executed in the final 10 minutes of the session  according to data compiled by BestEx Research  a developer of trading algorithms. That’s up from 27% in 2021.Now fresh evidence emerging from Europe — where the pattern is similar — suggests the trend may be hurting liquidity and distorting prices.It’s new ammo for critics of the global boom in passive investing  because index funds drive the phenomenon. These products typically buy and sell shares at the close  since the last prices of the day are used to set the benchmarks they aim to replicate.Assets in passive equity funds have surged over the past decade to more than $11.5 trillion in the US alone  according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence  shifting ever-more trading to the end of the session. Active players seeking to take advantage of that liquidity have followed  creating a self-reinforcing cycle.The closing auction in Europe  which occurs after the end of regular trading  now accounts for 28% of volumes on public venues  up from 23% four years ago  data from Bloomberg Intelligence and analytics firm big xyt show.“The common knowledge is that closing auctions are very  very good mechanisms to close markets ” said Benjamin Clapham at Goethe University Frankfurt  co-author of a new research paper titled Shifting Volumes to the Close: Consequences for Price Discovery and Market Quality. “This might be true  but if we have such a shift of volumes to this very last opportunity of trading in the day  we might see price inefficiencies.”The paper  which Clapham wrote with colleague Micha Bender and Deutsche Bundesbank researcher Benedikt Schwemmlein  focused on large-caps on the London  Paris and Frankfurt exchanges in the four years through mid-2023. The trio found shares generally move between the end of continuous trading and the last price set in the closing auction  yet 14% of that move reverses overnight — a sign it’s fueled by one-sided flows rather than fundamentals.The new research echoes earlier studies  including in the US  where a 2023 paper also argued that moves seen during the auction revert overnight as a result of the liquidity dynamic.Story continuesThe charge is one of a number leveled against passive investing  including that it can blindly inflate company valuations and wreak havoc when major indexes rebalance  triggering billions in one-way trades. The litany of concerns has inspired high-profile attacks from critics such as Elon Musk  and more recently Greenlight Capital’s David Einhorn.But the extent to which any closing distortions should cause concern is uncertain and  as with so much in the modern market  the debate isn’t clear cut.For Hitesh Mittal  BestEx Research’s founder  the overnight reversion is part of normal market function. Passive funds may be buying at fractionally higher prices at the close  but he reckons the cost is “way  way less” than liquidity providers would charge for transactions of their size in thinner liquidity earlier in the day.In the US  the mechanism to determine closing prices runs alongside the last minutes of continuous trading. Nearly 10% of all US shares were traded in that closing auction last month  nearing previous 2019 highs after dipping in the retail trading frenzy  data compiled by Rosenblatt Securities show.Chuck Mack  head of strategy for North American trading services for Nasdaq  said market participants like the transparent price discovery and “depth of liquidity” in closing auctions. He said US intraday liquidity is affected more by the growing fragmentation of stocks trading on different platforms.Meanwhile  two other researchers — Carole Comerton-Forde at the University of Melbourne and Barbara Rindi at Bocconi University — concluded in 2022 that ostensible European reversals might be due to noise at the market open  rather than distortions  and that intraday liquidity hasn’t been hurt by the closing auction. Writing on behalf of the duo  Comerton-Forde said regulators don’t have cause for concern yet  “but should continue to watch this space in case things change.”The London Stock Exchange didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for Euronext acknowledged that price reversions occur in the wake of indexes rebalancing  but said “observed reversals are typically modest  and market overreactions are common after significant liquidity events.”A Deutsche Börse spokesperson said that while there were different views among market participants  closing auctions were generally not seen as a problem.In the US  even as volumes shift to the end of day  the growing role of retail investors has prompted a number of brokerages like Robinhood to offer 24-hour trading of some securities to give them maximum opportunity to buy and sell. Yet for institutional pros  it’s increasingly all about those last few minutes.“When I do speak to clients who are trading portfolios that are more sensitized to these changes in liquidity  they will definitely wait ” said Mark Montgomery  head of business development at big xyt. “As the liquidity decreases in the continuous part of the day  the potential for them to leak information about their intent is far greater.”What do you make of the boom in the short-dated options?

As it stands  the aggregate amount of these offers is insufficient to ensure full repayment of all creditors of Mithra  and  therefore  the offers do not allow to create value for Mithra’s shareholders at the present time.Mithra has requested the suspension of trading of its shares on Euronext Brussels pending continuing negotiations with offering parties.Mithra postpones the publication of its Annual Report 2023 to a later date due to the current circumstances to reflect a situation in discontinuity.LIEGE  Belgium  April 29  2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mithra (Euronext Brussels: MITRA)  a company dedicated to women’s health  announces that it has received several binding offers1 for selected Mithra assets (particularly Estetra SRL) during the week of 22 April 2024  as part of its ongoing monetization process— first announced on 05 March 2024.In collaboration with Stifel Investment Bank and other expert advisors  Mithra is diligently analyzing these offers  which include all shares in Estetra SRL and certain other activities and assets within the Mithra group. Mithra continues to seek potential buyers for all its activities and assets (i.e.  Mithra CDMO  Novalon  Mithra R&D  Neuralis  Mithra parent co.).As it stands  the aggregate amount of these offers is insufficient to ensure full repayment of all creditors of Mithra. Therefore  the offers received will not create value for the shareholders of Mithra. Mithra remains committed to negotiating with the offering parties to enhance the value offered  acting in the best interest of all stakeholders. The Company is also considering taking appropriate action  including continuing negotiations for the relevant assets under court proceedings (as is the case for other assets of the Mithra group)  to advance these discussions further if necessary.Consequently  Mithra has requested the Financial Services and Markets Authority (FSMA) to suspend trading of the Company’s shares on Euronext Brussels pending the on-going negotiations.Mithra remains committed to executing its monetization process with diligence and transparency representing the interests of all stakeholders and will continue providing timely updates to the market and stakeholders as appropriate.Additionally  Mithra will postpone the publication of its Annual Report 2023 (originally scheduled for 30 April 2024) as it was prepared based on a going concern assumption. Instead  considering the recent events  an annual report will be prepared and published for Mithra reflecting a situation ""in discontinuity"" at a later date  which will be announced in a subsequent communication.About MithraMithra Pharmaceuticals SA (Euronext: MITRA) is a Belgian biopharmaceutical company dedicated to transforming women’s health by offering new choices through innovation  with a particular focus on contraception and menopause.

Sales in the medical segment increased by 36.4% to EUR 929 thousand.The optical communications segment continued to exhibit significant volatility due to the Asian context and investments dedicated to optical fiber. Sales for the first quarter of 2024 amounted to EUR 341 thousand compared to EUR 558 thousand for the first quarter of 2023. Thanks to its fabless organization  this business remains a profitability support factor for the Group  regardless of the activity levels in this market.Analysis of consolidated income statementMEMSCAP’s consolidated earnings (non-audited) for the first quarter of 2024 are given within the following table:In thousands of euros – Non-audited Q1 2023(3 months) Q1 2024(3 months) Revenue from continuing operations 3 668 3 832 Cost of revenue (2 146) (2 298) Gross margin 1 522 1 534 % of revenue 41.5% 40.0% Operating expenses* (1 017) (1 026) Operating profit / (loss) 505 508 Financial profit / (loss) (1) 109 Income tax expense (34) (9) Net profit / (loss) 470 608 * Net of research & development grants.(Any apparent discrepancies in totals are due to rounding.)The gross margin rate stood at 40.0% of consolidated revenue compared to 41.5% in the first quarter of 2023. This rate is notably impacted for the quarter by the integration and training of new hires in the production department. The gross margin thus amounted to EUR 1 534 thousand compared to EUR 1 522 thousand for the first quarter of 2023.Operating expenses  net of research and development grants  remained stable at EUR 1 026 thousand compared to EUR 1 017 thousand for the first quarter of 2023  demonstrating the Group's control over its structural costs.For the first quarter of 2024  the Group posted an operating profit from continuing operations of EUR 508 thousand (13.3% of consolidated revenue) compared to an operating profit of EUR 505 thousand for the first quarter of 2023.The financial income for the first quarter of 2024 benefited from a favourable exchange rate effect and amounted to EUR 109 thousand. The tax expense recognized over the first quarters of 2023 and 2024 corresponded to the change in deferred tax assets. This tax expense is a non-cash item.Net profit after tax thus amounted to EUR 608 thousand (15.9% of consolidated revenue) for the first quarter of 2024  compared to a net profit of EUR 470 thousand for the first quarter of 2023.MEMSCAP reported an adjusted EBITDA1 (non-audited) of EUR 827 thousand (21.6% of consolidated revenue) for the first quarter of 2024  an increase compared to the first quarter of 2023 (741 thousand euros  20.2% of consolidated revenue). It is noted that research and development costs were fully recognized as expenses and were not capitalized in the Group's balance sheet.1 Adjusted EBITDA means operating profit before depreciation  amortisation  and share-based payment charge (IFRS 2) and including foreign exchange gains/losses related to ordinary activities.PerspectivesWith this quarter  MEMSCAP achieves its 5th consecutive quarter of execution on the 4G plan driven by the dynamism of its aerospace and medical businesses.MEMSCAP also demonstrates that the volatility in the optical communications segment does not impact its trajectory  and that this business  through its fabless organization  continues to support the profitability of the group regardless of its sales levels.During this quarter  MEMSCAP improves its net profitability and EBITDA despite the increase in production resources and sales team.The MEMSCAP group thus maintains its course on the 4G plan while preparing for the post-2026 period through the development of new clients.Shareholders and investors video conference - Tuesday  April 30  2024 at 09:00 a.m.Thank you for registering and sending your questions in advance using the following link:Registration for the video conferenceMEMSCAP general shareholders’ meeting: May 31  2024.Q2 2024 earnings: July 29  2024.About MEMSCAPMEMSCAP is a leading provider MEMS based pressure sensors  best-in-class in term of precision and stability (very low drift) for two market segments: aerospace and medical.MEMSCAP also provides variable optical attenuators (VOA) for the optical communications market.For more information  visit our website at: www.memscap.comMEMSCAP is listed on Euronext Paris (Euronext Paris - Memscap - ISIN code: FR0010298620 - Ticker symbol: MEMS)View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240429182964/en/,neutral,0.04,0.95,0.01,mixed,0.52,0.27,0.2,True,English,"['Double-Digit Growth', 'Medical Sales', 'MEMSCAP', 'Q1', 'Aerospace', 'high-accuracy, high-stability pressure sensor solutions', 'Micro Electro Mechanical Systems', 'favourable exchange rate effect', '4G plan Shareholders', 'investors video conference', 'profitability support factor', 'deferred tax assets', '5th consecutive quarter', 'consolidated income statement', 'gross margin rate', '109 Income tax expense', 'Quarterly operating profit', 'Quarterly net profit', 'aerospace business Quarterly', 'optical communications segment', 'RECORD QUARTERLY SALES', 'AEROSPACE BUSINESS INCREASE', 'financial income', 'profitability drivers', 'historical record', 'optical fiber', 'Quarterly revenue', '508 Financial profit', 'audited data', 'significant volatility', 'new applications', 'Regulatory News', 'Euronext Paris', 'leading provider', 'first quarter', 'continuing operations', 'licensed trademarks', 'apparent discrepancies', 'previous quarters', 'development momentum', 'Asian context', 'fabless organization', 'activity levels', 'following table', 'development grants', 'new hires', 'production department', 'structural costs', 'cash item', 'development costs', 'balance sheet', '1 Adjusted EBITDA', 'medical businesses', 'medical segment', 'medical markets', 'aerospace segment', 'ADJUSTED EBITDA1', 'Operating expenses', 'consolidated revenue', 'consolidated earnings', 'Total revenue', 'MEMS technology', 'Market segments', 'largest market', '41 thousand euros', 'Strong growth', '6.1% growth', 'THE', 'Group', 'execution', 'Tuesday', 'April', 'MEMSCAP', 'March', 'Analysis', 'distribution', 'thousands', 'Q1', 'Royalties', 'totals', 'rounding', 'investments', '832 Cost', 'loss', 'research', 'integration', 'training', 'control', 'depreciation', 'amortisation', 'share-base', '09:00']",2024-04-29,2024-04-30,marketscreener.com

This figure takes into account the unfavorable working day impact over the last quarter of the fiscal year  standing at -1.5%[1].Revenue of €586.9m excluding Q_PERIOR and Aspirant ConsultingAt the end of the 2023/24 fiscal year  Wavestone's consolidated revenue stood at €701.1m  an increase of +32%  equivalent to +9% at constant scope and exchange rates (taking into account an unfavorable working day impact of -1.6%1). For the record  in 2023/24  Wavestone was targeting organic growth at least equal to that of the 2022/23 fiscal year (+7%).Excluding Q_PERIOR and Aspirant Consulting  12-month revenue reached €586.9m  exceeding the target of €580m.Consultant utilization rate stable at 73% in 2023/24; sales price up by +1%Due to an increased hesitancy in new projects at the start of the calendar year  and a less favorable business environment in the UK  the consultant utilization rate related to the scope excluding Q_PERIOR and Aspirant Consulting fell slightly in Q4  less than expected though. For the entire 2023/24 fiscal year  it stood at 73%; stable compared with the previous fiscal year.The average daily rate on the same scope reached €898 in 2023/24 – an increase of +1% compared with the average sales price for the whole of the previous fiscal year (€890). At constant exchange rates  the average daily rate was €900 in 2023/24.On the same scope still  with regard to business development  the order book fell slightly at 4.1 months of work at March 31  2024  compared with 4.2 months at December 31  2023.Wavestone plans to deploy consolidated operating indicators (except order book) across the entire new firm from Q1 2024/25.Q_PERIOR's business activity in line with planQ_PERIOR began the 2024 calendar year in a similar context to that of Wavestone. The resilient demand in the sectors of Insurance  Travel & Transportation and Energy helps limit the effects of a weaker economic environment in Germany.In this regard  Q_PERIOR started the year with a consultant utilization rate in line with the last months of 2023 and the company's plan  but  like Wavestone  with a marked slowdown in terms of growth.Caution maintained on recruitment; stable staff turnoverThe staff turnover rate remained stable over the past quarter.

The 52 x 11’ series was first pitched by Xilam Animation at Cartoon Forum in 2021 and is now set to be delivered in Q3 2025 with Romain Villemaine as the director (Ricky Zoom  Maya the Bee  Valiant). The first episodes will be released at the upcoming MIPCOM (October 2024).“Piggy Builders” is created by Marie Manand  Julien Hazebroucq and Emmanuelle Leleu and follows Cornelia  Cesar and Charlie  a trio of charismatic and curly-tailed piggy siblings who live in Fine Forest. Whilst they are very different to one another in nature  they have many things in common: they all love building  they all love solving problems  they all love their community and  most importantly  they all love each other. There’s one more thing they have in common: they all have a lot to learn about working together. When these three little piggies don’t function as a team  the projects they’re working on go wrong in very silly and funny ways. But when they manage to work as a team  the impossible becomes possible!As the piggies embark on their building projects  they also must face a lazy and selfish wolf  Vern  who thinks he’s bigger and badder than he really is. Vern interferes with piggies’ projects and rubs his paws in glee at the prospect that his meddling will mess things up for them.Marc du Pontavice  Chairman and CEO at Xilam Animation said: “As we continue expanding our offering of CG content  “Piggy Builders” makes the perfect addition to our slate of proprietary content as it brings so many endearing characters and humorous stories of teamwork  while also highlighting the importance of family. “Piggy Builders” received a fantastic response at Cartoon Forum  and we’re now honoured to have such strong national broadcast partners in France Télévisions  BBC and ZDF joining us on this adventure. We look forward to collaborating with each of these broadcasters and to introducing our wonderful little piggies to audiences  who we’re sure will charm and entertain preschoolers and families around the world.”About XilamA major player in animation  Xilam is an integrated studio founded in 1999 that creates  produces and distributes original programmes in more than 190 countries for both children and adult audiences.

For this reason  the Group will not communicate on the evolution of this data compared with the 1st quarter of the previous year.Geographically and on a reported basis  sales in Europe came to €70.2m  in the Americas to €46.2m  including €28.5m for the United States  and in Asia/Pacific to €17.3m.Sales of products for companion animals came to €94.3m  and sales for farm animals to €39.4m.A comparison with FY 2022 eliminates the base effect and gives a relevant idea of the dynamics of the Group’s activities  and in particular of its two strategic drivers  Essentials and the United States. In 2023  these activities accounted for almost 75% of sales.In the 1st quarter 2024 and at constant exchange rates  Essentials achieved organic growth of +8.1% and the United States grew by +16.8% compared with the first quarter 2022.Vetoquinol’s two strategic drivers are continuing to grow at a sustained pace; the base effect mentioned above will be smoothed out by the end of the 1st half-year 2024.Solid cash flow generation continues to strengthen Vetoquinol's financial structure.Sales for the first quarter of 2024 have not been audited by the Statutory Auditors.Next publication: Sales and Interim Results  September 12  2024ABOUT VETOQUINOLVetoquinol is a leading international player in animal health  with operations in Europe  the Americas and Asia/Pacific.Independent and a pure player  Vetoquinol innovates  develops and markets veterinary medicines and non-medicated products for livestock (cattle  pigs) and pets (dogs  cats).Since its creation in 1933  Vetoquinol has combined innovation and geographic diversification.

Regarding operations  we continue to deliver on our commitments  and we are now established in Europe and North America as a reference player for the renewable natural gas (RNG) production from landfills. Now that the foundations of the Company have been set  the resulting increased revenue and a carefully controlled cost base will enable us to achieve EBITDA breakeven in the course of 2025. In doing so  we will illustrate our ability to be a driver of the energy transition  while creating value for our partners and shareholders.”Waga Energy (EPA: WAGA)  a specialist in the production of Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) from landfill gas  today reports its results for the fiscal year ended December 31  2023  as approved by the Company’s Board of Directors on April 26  2024.The Group's 2023 results together with a strong commercial momentum confirm the targets set for 2026 at the Capital Markets Day on February 8  fueled by revenue growth (€33.3m  +74% yoy) driven by a production of 336 GWh (+49% yoy) thanks to the commissioning of 5 new WAGABOX® units  and by the sustained high uptime (average of 96% on units in operation for at least 12 months).Bolstered by revenue growth  full year 2023 EBITDA totaled -€4.8m  versus -€3.1m in H1 2023 and-€3.2m for full year 2022  despite higher electricity costs in France and one-off operating expenses owing to the increased number of units commissioned.This performance demonstrates Waga Energy’s robust business model in an inflationary environment and the strength of its offering from a technical standpoint.A pipeline of over 12 TWh of installed capacitySales momentum remained strong  with 6 new projects signed in 2023  doubling the capacity under construction compared to 2022 given the size of these projects. To date  the Group has 14 units under construction[2]  representing an additional production capacity of 1.3 TWh per year. The pipeline includes 167 projects  representing a total installed capacity of more than 12 TWh per year  above the level of the Capital Markets Day.At end-2023  the Group benefitted from a solid cash position  totaling €39m  strengthened by the $60m Eiffel financing raised in February and the successful €52m capital increase completed in March. The gearing of 37%  combined with a business model generating highly predictable cash flows over 10 to 25 years  underscores the strong potential for accessing various additional debt sources  extending to all WAGABOX®the 80% target gearing achieved on already operational units.At present  the Group actively runs 23 RNG production units[3] in France  Spain  Canada and the United States  representing an installed capacity of 915 GWh per year. 14 units are under construction in France  Canada and the United States[4]. Once fully operational  all 37 units will produce 2.2 TWh per year[5]. Annual signed recurring revenues based on operational units and projects under construction is around €100m  compared to €46m a year ago.On the back of these strong results  the Group confirms its targets for 2026:Revenue of ~€200mEBITDA breakeven in the course of 2025Installed capacity of ~4 TWh per yearAnnual signed recurring revenue in excess of €400mInstalled capacity to avoid emissions of 660 000 tons of CO 2 eq. per yearNext release: September 30  2024  after close of tradingAbout Waga EnergyWaga Energy (Euronext Paris: FR0012532810  EPA: WAGA) produces competitively priced Renewable Natural Gas (also known as “biomethane”) by upgrading landfill gas using a patented purification technology called WAGABOX®.

The weakness of the French residential market should be gradually mitigated this year by the ramp-up of infrastructure projects awarded to the Vicat Group.This strong performance in the first quarter enables us to confirm our full-year outlook for growth in sales and operating profitability.As previously announced  the 'From Low Carbon to Zero Carbon' initiative is taking shape with the progress of our two ultimate decarbonisation projects in Montalieu  France  where discussions with stakeholders are progressing and technological choices are becoming clearer  and in Lebec  California  where the CCS project has been selected under the IRA for subsidies of up to $500 million  in addition to tax credits  which could exceed $1 billion over twelve years.”The Group’s sales rose +1.2% on a reported basis to €911 million in the first quarter. Organic growth in sales came to +7.9% at constant scope and exchange rates. This performance was achieved as a result of:+4.1% growth in Cement volumes to 6.9 million tons  with trends varying from one Group market to another  including:- a slowdown in European markets  especially in France  attributable to weakness in the residential sector;- the increase in volumes in the United States as the Ragland plant reached full capacity and volumes rebounded in California;- growth in Asia owing to the strong increase in volumes in India and a favourable base of comparison for volumes in Kazakhstan;- dynamic trends in the Mediterranean region.a +5.4% increase in concrete volumes to 2.2 million m 3   especially in the United States and Turkey;  especially in the United States and Turkey; a decrease in aggregate volumes of -6.8% to 5.1 million tons  notably in France;a still resilient pricing environment in most markets with a favourable cost/price differential.The Group’s sales were impacted by an unfavourable currency effect of –€60 million (–6.7%) chiefly arising from depreciation in the Turkish lira and Egyptian pound against the euro  which was very marginally offset by appreciation in the Swiss franc against the euro in the first quarter. There were no changes in the scope of consolidation during the year.1. SALES BY GEOGRAPHICAL REGION1.1. France(€ million) First-quarter 2024 First-quarter 2023 Change reported Changelfl* Consolidated sales 270 297 -8.8% -8.8% *like-for-like  i.e. at constant scope and exchange ratesIn the first quarter  sales in France were again impacted by the weak volumes caused by the contraction in the residential market.The Cement business was affected by a further volume decline due to the contraction in the residential market. Nonetheless  the project to build the Lyon-Turin rail link that began in late 2023 is expected to progressively curb the effects of this slowdown in 2024. Hikes in cement prices at the beginning of the year made a positive contribution over the period. Cement operational sales fell –9.5% in the first quarter.The Concrete & Aggregates business was also affected by the volume contraction despite a more favourable base of comparison than in Cement. The downturn in Concrete & Aggregates volumes began back in the first quarter of 2023  while Cement volumes were resilient in the early part of that year. Concrete & Aggregates operational sales fell –10.0% in the first quarter.Other Products & Services sales posted a small decline.1.2 Europe (excluding France)(€ million) First-quarter 2024 First-quarter 2023 Change reported Changelfl* Consolidated sales 92 81 +14.2% +9.7% *like-for-like  i.e. at constant scope and exchange ratesIn Europe  business rebounded in the first quarter of 2024. It was supported by the healthy performance of Altola (waste treatment and recycling) and Vigier Rail (precast business) in Switzerland and appreciation in the Swiss franc against the euro.In Switzerland  operational sales moved up +10.7% at constant scope and exchange rates.The Cement business in Switzerland was again impacted by the weakness of the residential market  with volumes declining in the first quarter. Price increases were introduced at the beginning of the year. Altola  a waste treatment and recycling subsidiary  made a positive contribution over the period.Concrete & Aggregates operational sales grew appreciably as a result of a price hike and favourable base of comparison effects over the period.Other Products & Services operational sales posted a strong increase thanks to an improvement in the product mix of the precast business (Vigier Rail).In Italy  operational sales remained stable in the first quarter.1.3 Americas(€ million) First-quarter 2024 First-quarter 2023 Change reported Changelfl* Consolidated sales 222 198 +12.5% +12.4% *like-for-like  i.e. at constant scope and exchange ratesSales in the Americas rose significantly in the first quarter of 2024 as a result of volume growth in the United States amid favourable pricing trends  despite a business contraction in Brazil.In the United States  the California and South-East US regions recorded dynamic business trends. Volumes grew strongly in California in the first quarter  boosted by a favourable base of comparison effect since highly adverse weather conditions depressed volumes in the first half of 2023. Volumes at the Ragland plant also rose as production reached full capacity. The pricing environment remains favourable in both regions  with the carryover effect of the price increases introduced in 2024. Cement operational sales rose +19.2% in the United States at constant scope and exchange rates.Concrete sales rose strongly in the United States with dynamic market trends both in California  as a result of a catch-up effect linked to a highly favourable base of comparison  and in the South-East. Selling prices again moved higher in both regions. Concrete operational sales rose +28.8% in the United States at constant scope and exchange rates.In Brazil  operational sales in Brazil fell –10.0% at constant scope and exchange rates amid a stable macroeconomic environment compared with 2023.The Group’s Cement business slowed down with volumes and prices falling in the first quarter. The commercial environment in the Mid-West region where Ciplan operates has worsened as a result of fiercer competition.The Concrete & Aggregates business showed greater resilience  with aggregates and concrete volumes declining  but selling prices moving higher.1.4 Asia (India and Kazakhstan)(€ million) First-quarter 2024 First-quarter 2023 Change reported Changelfl* Consolidated sales 120 112 +6.8% +8.9% *like-for-like  i.e. at constant scope and exchange ratesThe Group’s business in Asia expanded in the first quarter thanks to solid performance in Kazakhstan and India.Business grew in India during the first quarter  with volumes up sharply as a result of strong demand and a positive base of comparison effect. The improvement in price/cost differentials since the second half of 2023 has boosted competitiveness. In a competitive environment  selling prices moved slightly lower over the period. Operational sales in India moved up +8.8% at constant scope and exchange rates.Sales in Kazakhstan rose in the first quarter in an expanding market. Volumes experienced strong growth over the period as a result of dynamic performance in the Almaty region and a favourable base of comparison. Sales in the first quarter of 2023 were seriously disrupted by issues affecting the rail supply chain  which held back volumes. Prices fell back slightly over the period amid fiercer competition. As a result  operational sales grew +12.1% in Kazakhstan at constant scope and exchange rates.1.5 Mediterranean (Turkey and Egypt)(€ million) First-quarter 2024 First-quarter 2023 Change reported Changelfl* Consolidated sales 104 104 +0.7% +58.9% *like-for-like  i.e. at constant scope and exchange ratesThe Group’s sales trends in the Mediterranean region were positive  with volume growth in Turkey and export opportunities in Egypt  even though visibility remains limited. The region’s contribution to consolidated sales was affected by the strong fall in the value of the Turkish lira and Egyptian pound against the euro over the period.Despite a persistently hyperinflationary macroeconomic environment  the Cement business in Turkey posted solid volume growth in the first quarter as a result of the support provided by the government to the construction sector and a favourable base of comparison. First-quarter 2023 sales were impacted by the earthquake in South-East Turkey. Selling prices were hiked to make up for the effects of inflation on production costs. As a result  Cement operational sales in Turkey grew +2.6% (up +77.0% at constant scope and exchange rates).The Concrete & Aggregates business in Turkey expanded in the first quarter as a result of strong growth in concrete volumes and higher selling prices. As a result  operational sales grew +42.0% (up +145.0% at constant scope and exchange rates).The Cement business in Egypt experienced sluggish domestic market conditions  with volumes declining  especially during Ramadan. These factors were offset partially by growth in cement and clinker volumes for export to the Mediterranean region and to Africa. Prices rose during the first quarter in a market regulated by the authorities. Overall  Cement operational sales in Egypt declined by –6.3% at constant scope and exchange rates.1.6 Africa (Senegal  Mali  Mauritania)(€ million) First-quarter 2024 First-quarter 2023 Change reported Changelfl* Consolidated sales 101 108 -6.5% -5.5% *like-for-like  i.e. at constant scope and exchange ratesIn the first quarter  the Group’s business in Africa was hit by power cuts in Mali  while it contracted very slightly in Senegal and grew in Mauritania.The Cement business in Senegal showed resilience in the first quarter  with volumes declining slightly  chiefly as a result of Ramadan. In a political environment dominated by the presidential elections  sales did not experience any major disruption. Conditions remain dynamic in the domestic market  which is supported by strong residential demand and infrastructure projects. Prices have been stable since the beginning of the year. Cement operational sales in Senegal fell –3.8% at constant scope.Aggregates operational sales in Senegal posted growth of +4.7%  thanks to a continuing boost from the major public works projects in progress.Cement sales in Mali were seriously affected by power supply issues. As a result  operational sales fell –18.6%.Cement operational sales rose +8.6% in Mauritania at constant scope and exchange rates as a result of dynamic business trends.2. OUTLOOK FOR 2024In 2024  the Group expects a continued increase in its sales  supported by growth in the United States and the resilience of emerging markets  even taking into account the residential sector’s weakness in Europe.Based on the significant increase in the first quarter  the Group is reiterating the EBITDA trend expected over the year as a whole.EBITDA generated by the Group in 2024 should be higher than the 2023 level.This objective takes into account further operational savings at the Ragland plant and an easing in energy cost inflation over the period  with a favourable base of comparison effect in the first half of the year.In 2024  the Group’s capex is likely to total around €325 million following delays to investments in a new kiln in Senegal  which will now take place in 2024.The increase in EBITDA  tight grip on the working capital requirement and disciplined investment approach will pave the way for a further decrease in the Group’s net debt.As a result  the Group has set a target of lowering its leverage to below 1.3x by year-end 2025.Outlook by country:In France  business trends are expected to be held back by the marked slowdown in residential construction  offset partially by demand from the infrastructure segment. The progressive start-up in a large rail infrastructure project in the South-East region should support the business in the future.In Switzerland  stable business trends are expected  with volumes holding steady at a low level amid a resilient pricing environment.In the United States  the growth in sales in the South-East US should continue with the operation of kiln 2 at the Ragland plant at full capacity over a full year. In addition  business trends in California should benefit from a favourable base of comparison effect relative to the first half of 2023. The increased use of alternative fuels and more widespread uptake of “1L”-type cement  which consumes less clinker  should support margin improvement.In a stabilising market in Brazil with a lower level of sales  results are expected to be close to the levels seen in 2023. Production performance improvements should provide a further boost.In India  the market should continue to grow  especially in the first half thanks to a favourable base of comparison effect and the impact of cost reductions over the full year amid a fiercely competitive environment.In Kazakhstan  the more competitive environment and saturation of the production facilities are expected to curb the growth in volumes and prices.In Turkey  the macroeconomic environment is likely to remain dominated by inflation and the weakness of the Turkish lira. Business trends are expected to draw strength from the reconstruction drive after the February 2023 earthquake and the pre-electoral environment in the first six months of the year. The Group will continue to pursue a pricing policy intended to at least cover the strong inflation in costs.In Egypt  domestic market conditions are expected to remain sluggish in a competitive environment still regulated by the authorities. As in 2023  the Group plans to pursue opportunities to export clinker and cement.In West Africa  visibility is declining with mounting political instability in the region  the impact of which is hard to gauge as things stand. In Senegal  the Cement business will remain hampered until kiln 6 starts up amid a pricing environment regulated by the government.3. CLIMATE PERFORMANCEThe Vicat Group has announced its climate roadmap and the 2030 target of reducing its direct specific carbon emissions to 497 kg CO 2 net per tonne of cement equivalent and to 430 kg CO 2 net per tonne of cement equivalent in Europe. This objective is solely based on existing proven technologies and does not rely on any technological breakthroughs  such as carbon capture and storage/use.The Group has accelerated its decarbonisation roadmap and its net-zero carbon goal with the launch of the “Low carbon to Zero carbon” initiative.This programme involves two final decarbonisation projects – to capture carbon by storing it or using it to manufacture synthetic fuels at the Montalieu (France) and Lebec (California) plants.The “VAIA” project at Montalieu  designed to capture and store 1.2 million tons of CO2 per year  is advancing. Talks are underway with the French authorities and with the European Union with a view to securing subsidies. The decisions on which technologies to use have been made  and the partner ecosystem for the project is taking shape.In California  the Lebec Net Zero (LNZ) project  designed to capture and store 0.9 million tons of CO2 per year  has been selected by the US Department of Energy to receive a grant  for 50% of the investment  up to $500 million (announced on 25 March 2024) covering in particular an industrial-scale carbon capture and storage installation. In addition  an inflation-linked tax incentive of $85 per tonne sequestered may be available for a 12-year period. This announcement represents a major step forward  demonstrating the project’s credibility. Talks are set to continue with the project partners to lay down the implementation arrangements.4. HIGHLIGHTS29 February 2024 – Vicat’s involvement in the Athletes Village of Paris 2024.Vicat has supplied low-carbon concrete for the Athletes Village from its on-site concrete plant  operated by its BETON VICAT subsidiary. The use of DECA low-carbon cement plant  including CEM4 (pozzolan cement) from the Créchy cement plant and the CARAT carbon-negative binder  lowered emissions by over 30% compared with traditional solutions for the 70 000 m3 of concrete supplied. Over the project as a whole  almost 4 500 tons of CO 2 equivalent was avoided.7 March 2024 – Vicat joins the SBF 120 indexThe Vicat Group has announced its entry to the SBF 120  a key index of the Paris Stock Exchange that includes the top 120 shares listed on Euronext Paris in terms of liquidity and market capitalisation.

The Cellvizio procedure is now performed preoperatively by Prof. Stéphane Renaud  MD  PhD  a leading thoracic surgeon at the University Hospital (CHRU) in Nancy  France. This initiative is part of a global strategic expansion plan to establish Centers of Excellence in established and emerging clinical indications in several countries.The rise in lung cancer screening coupled with the increased use of chest-computed tomography (CT) has generated a surge in the detection of suspected malignant lung lesions globally  increasing the need for more effective and efficient diagnostic methods. Given that over 80% of these incidental lesions develop in the peripheral bronchi  they pose a challenge to conventional bronchoscopy due to their difficult visualization and accessibility.Combined with endobronchial navigation  Cellvizio improves bronchoscopy and allows simple  minimally invasive access to all areas of the lung  revealing the cellular architecture of tissues in real time. This direct visualization is a game-changer  because it enables instant guidance to be given  even for small lesions  without waiting for rapid cytology results  which are of very low diagnostic quality. This innovation not only reduces the length of procedures  but also improves diagnostic accuracy by enabling precise targeting of lesions and of biopsies  while providing greater safety for patients.""In the field of cancer diagnosis  the precision of biopsy locations is essential. Traditional methods risk sampling from necrotic or merely inflammatory sites  leading to potentially misleading  false-negative results. Cellvizio's real-time visual inspection empowers us to target biopsies more accurately  focusing on areas that visually exhibit suspicious characteristics. This strategic approach significantly mitigates the risk of false negatives  ensuring a higher degree of diagnostic confidence” commented Professor Stéphane Renaud  MD  PhD  Department of Thoracic Surgery  Nancy Regional University Hospital  France.""With the upcoming programs of lung cancer screening in Europe  there is a planned exponential growth of bronchoscopic examinations of patients with difficult to reach peripheral nodules that can lead to false negatives  additional unnecessary procedures and costs. Cellvizio has been proven to be a key addition to bronchoscopy in order to improve the physician’s ability to place biopsy tools precisely in the lesions and improve the overall diagnostic yield said Sacha Loiseau  Ph.D.  Founder  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Mauna Kea Technologies. “We are very excited to have the University Hospital in Nancy serve as our Center of Excellence for Cellvizio in lung cancer diagnostics in France  another significant step forward in the scaling of the use of Cellvizio in the ever-expanding field of lung cancer diagnosis and treatment.”***About Mauna Kea TechnologiesMauna Kea Technologies is a global medical device company that manufactures and sells Cellvizio®  the real-time in vivo cellular imaging platform.

The first episodes will be released at the upcoming MIPCOM (October 2024).Piggy Builders is created by Marie Manand  Julien Hazebroucq and Emmanuelle Leleu and follows Cornelia  Cesar and Charlie  a trio of charismatic and curly-tailed piggy siblings who live in Fine Forest. Whilst they are very different to one another in nature  they have many things in common: they all love building  they all love solving problems  they all love their community and  most importantly  they all love each other. There's one more thing they have in common: they all have a lot to learn about working together. When these three little piggies don't function as a team  the projects they're working on go wrong in very silly and funny ways. But when they manage to work as a team  the impossible becomes possible!As the piggies embark on their building projects  they also must face a lazy and selfish wolf  Vern  who thinks he's bigger and badder than he really is. Vern interferes with piggies' projects and rubs his paws in glee at the prospect that his meddling will mess things up for them.here or remove ads . 3rd party Ad.

The weakness of the French residential market should be gradually mitigated this year by the ramp-up of infrastructure projects awarded to the Vicat Group. This strong performance in the first quarter enables us to confirm our full-year outlook for growth in sales and operating profitability. As previously announced  the 'From Low Carbon to Zero Carbon' initiative is taking shape with the progress of our two ultimate decarbonisation projects in Montalieu  France  where discussions with stakeholders are progressing and technological choices are becoming clearer  and in Lebec  California  where the CCS project has been selected under the IRA for subsidies of up to $500 million  in addition to tax credits  which could exceed $1 billion over twelve years."" 1First-quarter 2024 sales The Group's sales rose +1.2% on a reported basis to €911 million in the first quarter. Organic growth in sales came to +7.9% at constant scope and exchange rates. This performance was achieved as a result of: +4.1% growth in Cement volumes to 6.9 million tons  with trends varying from one Group market to another  including:a slowdown in European markets  especially in France  attributable to weakness in the residential sector; the increase in volumes in the United States as the Ragland plant reached full capacity and volumes rebounded in California; growth in Asia owing to the strong increase in volumes in India and a favourable base of comparison for volumes in Kazakhstan; dynamic trends in the Mediterranean region.a +5.4% increase in concrete volumes to 2.2 million m 3   especially in the United States and Turkey;a decrease in aggregate volumes of -6.8% to 5.1 million tons  notably in France;-6.8% to 5.1 million tons  notably in France; a still resilient pricing environment in most markets with a favourable cost/price differential. The Group's sales were impacted by an unfavourable currency effect of -€60 million (-6.7%) chiefly arising from depreciation in the Turkish lira and Egyptian pound against the euro  which was very marginally offset by appreciation in the Swiss franc against the euro in the first quarter. There were no changes in the scope of consolidation during the year. 1. SALES BY GEOGRAPHICAL REGION 1.1. France First-quarter First-quarter Change Change (€ million) 2024 2023 reported lfl* Consolidated sales 270 297 -8.8% -8.8% *like-for-like  i.e. at constant scope and exchange rates In the first quarter  sales in France were again impacted by the weak volumes caused by the contraction in the residential market. The Cement business was affected by a further volume decline due to the contraction in the residential market. Nonetheless  the project to build the Lyon-Turin rail link that began in late 2023 is expected to progressively curb the effects of this slowdown in 2024. Hikes in cement prices at the beginning of the year made a positive contribution over the period. Cement operational sales fell -9.5% in the first quarter. The Concrete & Aggregates business was also affected by the volume contraction despite a more favourable base of comparison than in Cement. The downturn in Concrete & Aggregates volumes began back in the first quarter of 2023  while Cement volumes were resilient in the early part of that year. Concrete & Aggregates operational sales fell -10.0% in the first quarter. Other Products & Services sales posted a small decline. 1.2 Europe (excluding France) First-quarter First-quarter Change Change (€ million) 2024 2023 reported lfl* Consolidated sales 92 81 +14.2% +9.7% *like-for-like  i.e. at constant scope and exchange rates 2First-quarter 2024 sales In Europe  business rebounded in the first quarter of 2024. It was supported by the healthy performance of Altola (waste treatment and recycling) and Vigier Rail (precast business) in Switzerland and appreciation in the Swiss franc against the euro. In Switzerland  operational sales moved up +10.7% at constant scope and exchange rates. The Cement business in Switzerland was again impacted by the weakness of the residential market  with volumes declining in the first quarter. Price increases were introduced at the beginning of the year. Altola  a waste treatment and recycling subsidiary  made a positive contribution over the period. Concrete & Aggregates operational sales grew appreciably as a result of a price hike and favourable base of comparison effects over the period. Other Products & Services operational sales posted a strong increase thanks to an improvement in the product mix of the precast business (Vigier Rail). In Italy  operational sales remained stable in the first quarter. 1.3 Americas First-quarter First-quarter Change Change (€ million) 2024 2023 reported lfl* Consolidated sales 222 198 +12.5% +12.4% *like-for-like  i.e. at constant scope and exchange rates Sales in the Americas rose significantly in the first quarter of 2024 as a result of volume growth in the United States amid favourable pricing trends  despite a business contraction in Brazil. In the United States  the California and South-East US regions recorded dynamic business trends. Volumes grew strongly in California in the first quarter  boosted by a favourable base of comparison effect since highly adverse weather conditions depressed volumes in the first half of 2023. Volumes at the Ragland plant also rose as production reached full capacity. The pricing environment remains favourable in both regions  with the carryover effect of the price increases introduced in 2024. Cement operational sales rose +19.2% in the United States at constant scope and exchange rates. Concrete sales rose strongly in the United States with dynamic market trends both in California  as a result of a catch-up effect linked to a highly favourable base of comparison  and in the South-East. Selling prices again moved higher in both regions. Concrete operational sales rose +28.8% in the United States at constant scope and exchange rates. In Brazil  operational sales in Brazil fell -10.0% at constant scope and exchange rates amid a stable macroeconomic environment compared with 2023. The Group's Cement business slowed down with volumes and prices falling in the first quarter. The commercial environment in the Mid-West region where Ciplan operates has worsened as a result of fiercer competition. The Concrete & Aggregates business showed greater resilience  with aggregates and concrete volumes declining  but selling prices moving higher. 3First-quarter 2024 sales 1.4 Asia (India and Kazakhstan) First-quarter First-quarter Change Change (€ million) 2024 2023 reported lfl* Consolidated sales 120 112 +6.8% +8.9% *like-for-like  i.e. at constant scope and exchange rates The Group's business in Asia expanded in the first quarter thanks to solid performance in Kazakhstan and India. Business grew in India during the first quarter  with volumes up sharply as a result of strong demand and a positive base of comparison effect. The improvement in price/cost differentials since the second half of 2023 has boosted competitiveness. In a competitive environment  selling prices moved slightly lower over the period. Operational sales in India moved up +8.8% at constant scope and exchange rates. Sales in Kazakhstan rose in the first quarter in an expanding market. Volumes experienced strong growth over the period as a result of dynamic performance in the Almaty region and a favourable base of comparison. Sales in the first quarter of 2023 were seriously disrupted by issues affecting the rail supply chain  which held back volumes. Prices fell back slightly over the period amid fiercer competition. As a result  operational sales grew +12.1% in Kazakhstan at constant scope and exchange rates. 1.5 Mediterranean (Turkey and Egypt) First-quarter First-quarter Change Change (€ million) 2024 2023 reported lfl* Consolidated sales 104 104 +0.7% +58.9% *like-for-like  i.e. at constant scope and exchange rates The Group's sales trends in the Mediterranean region were positive  with volume growth in Turkey and export opportunities in Egypt  even though visibility remains limited. The region's contribution to consolidated sales was affected by the strong fall in the value of the Turkish lira and Egyptian pound against the euro over the period. Despite a persistently hyperinflationary macroeconomic environment  the Cement business in Turkey posted solid volume growth in the first quarter as a result of the support provided by the government to the construction sector and a favourable base of comparison. First-quarter 2023 sales were impacted by the earthquake in South-East Turkey. Selling prices were hiked to make up for the effects of inflation on production costs. As a result  Cement operational sales in Turkey grew +2.6% (up +77.0% at constant scope and exchange rates). The Concrete & Aggregates business in Turkey expanded in the first quarter as a result of strong growth in concrete volumes and higher selling prices. As a result  operational sales grew +42.0% (up +145.0% at constant scope and exchange rates). The Cement business in Egypt experienced sluggish domestic market conditions  with volumes declining  especially during Ramadan. These factors were offset partially by growth in cement and clinker volumes for export to the Mediterranean region and to Africa. Prices rose during the first quarter in a market regulated by the authorities. Overall  Cement operational sales in Egypt declined by -6.3% at constant scope and exchange rates. 4First-quarter 2024 sales 1.6 Africa (Senegal  Mali  Mauritania) First-quarter First-quarter Change Change (€ million) 2024 2023 reported lfl* Consolidated sales 101 108 -6.5% -5.5% *like-for-like  i.e. at constant scope and exchange rates In the first quarter  the Group's business in Africa was hit by power cuts in Mali  while it contracted very slightly in Senegal and grew in Mauritania. The Cement business in Senegal showed resilience in the first quarter  with volumes declining slightly  chiefly as a result of Ramadan. In a political environment dominated by the presidential elections  sales did not experience any major disruption. Conditions remain dynamic in the domestic market  which is supported by strong residential demand and infrastructure projects. Prices have been stable since the beginning of the year. Cement operational sales in Senegal fell -3.8% at constant scope. Aggregates operational sales in Senegal posted growth of +4.7%  thanks to a continuing boost from the major public works projects in progress. Cement sales in Mali were seriously affected by power supply issues. As a result  operational sales fell - 18.6%. Cement operational sales rose +8.6% in Mauritania at constant scope and exchange rates as a result of dynamic business trends. 2. OUTLOOK FOR 2024 In 2024  the Group expects a continued increase in its sales  supported by growth in the United States and the resilience of emerging markets  even taking into account the residential sector's weakness in Europe. Based on the significant increase in the first quarter  the Group is reiterating the EBITDA trend expected over the year as a whole. EBITDA generated by the Group in 2024 should be higher than the 2023 level. This objective takes into account further operational savings at the Ragland plant and an easing in energy cost inflation over the period  with a favourable base of comparison effect in the first half of the year. In 2024  the Group's capex is likely to total around €325 million following delays to investments in a new kiln in Senegal  which will now take place in 2024. The increase in EBITDA  tight grip on the working capital requirement and disciplined investment approach will pave the way for a further decrease in the Group's net debt. As a result  the Group has set a target of lowering its leverage to below 1.3x by year-end 2025. 5First-quarter 2024 sales Outlook by country: In France  business trends are expected to be held back by the marked slowdown in residential construction  offset partially by demand from the infrastructure segment. The progressive start-up in a large rail infrastructure project in the South-East region should support the business in the future. In Switzerland  stable business trends are expected  with volumes holding steady at a low level amid a resilient pricing environment. In the United States  the growth in sales in the South-East US should continue with the operation of kiln 2 at the Ragland plant at full capacity over a full year. In addition  business trends in California should benefit from a favourable base of comparison effect relative to the first half of 2023. The increased use of alternative fuels and more widespread uptake of ""1L""-type cement  which consumes less clinker  should support margin improvement. In a stabilising market in Brazil with a lower level of sales  results are expected to be close to the levels seen in 2023. Production performance improvements should provide a further boost. In India  the market should continue to grow  especially in the first half thanks to a favourable base of comparison effect and the impact of cost reductions over the full year amid a fiercely competitive environment. In Kazakhstan  the more competitive environment and saturation of the production facilities are expected to curb the growth in volumes and prices. In Turkey  the macroeconomic environment is likely to remain dominated by inflation and the weakness of the Turkish lira. Business trends are expected to draw strength from the reconstruction drive after the February 2023 earthquake and the pre-electoral environment in the first six months of the year. The Group will continue to pursue a pricing policy intended to at least cover the strong inflation in costs. In Egypt  domestic market conditions are expected to remain sluggish in a competitive environment still regulated by the authorities. As in 2023  the Group plans to pursue opportunities to export clinker and cement. In West Africa  visibility is declining with mounting political instability in the region  the impact of which is hard to gauge as things stand. In Senegal  the Cement business will remain hampered until kiln 6 starts up amid a pricing environment regulated by the government. 3. CLIMATE PERFORMANCE The Vicat Group has announced its climate roadmap and the 2030 target of reducing its direct specific carbon emissions to 497 kg CO2 net per tonne of cement equivalent and to 430 kg CO2 net per tonne of cement equivalent in Europe. This objective is solely based on existing proven technologies and does not rely on any technological breakthroughs  such as carbon capture and storage/use. The Group has accelerated its decarbonisation roadmap and its net-zerocarbon goal with the launch of the ""Low carbon to Zero carbon"" initiative. This programme involves two final decarbonisation projects - to capture carbon by storing it or using it to manufacture synthetic fuels at the Montalieu (France) and Lebec (California) plants. 6First-quarter 2024 sales The ""VAIA"" project at Montalieu  designed to capture and store 1.2 million tons of CO2 per year  is advancing. Talks are underway with the French authorities and with the European Union with a view to securing subsidies. The decisions on which technologies to use have been made  and the partner ecosystem for the project is taking shape. In California  the Lebec Net Zero (LNZ) project  designed to capture and store 0.9 million tons of CO2 per year  has been selected by the US Department of Energy to receive a grant  for 50% of the investment  up to $500 million (announced on 25 March 2024) covering in particular an industrial-scale carbon capture and storage installation. In addition  an inflation-linked tax incentive of $85 per tonne sequestered may be available for a 12-year period. This announcement represents a major step forward  demonstrating the project's credibility. Talks are set to continue with the project partners to lay down the implementation arrangements. 4. HIGHLIGHTS 29 February 2024 - Vicat's involvement in the Athletes Village of Paris 2024. Vicat has supplied low-carbon concrete for the Athletes Village from its on-site concrete plant  operated by its BETON VICAT subsidiary. The use of DECA low-carbon cement plant  including CEM4 (pozzolan cement) from the Créchy cement plant and the CARAT carbon-negative binder  lowered emissions by over 30% compared with traditional solutions for the 70 000 m3 of concrete supplied. Over the project as a whole  almost 4 500 tons of CO2 equivalent was avoided. 7 March 2024 - Vicat joins the SBF 120 index The Vicat Group has announced its entry to the SBF 120  a key index of the Paris Stock Exchange that includes the top 120 shares listed on Euronext Paris in terms of liquidity and market capitalisation.

The shareholders' meeting determined that the price limit in the event of purchase will not apply if circumstances of an extraordinary nature occur on the market  while  in the event of disposal  the price limit will not apply in the event of deeds of disposal other than sale and in particular in hypotheses of a share exchange  share swap  exchange  contribution  transfer or other deed of disposal of treasury shares carried out in the context of acquisitions of shareholdings or implementation of industrial projects or other extraordinary finance operations involving the assignment or disposal of treasury shares (such as  by way of example  mergers  demergers  issue of convertible bonds or warrants  etc.) or in cases of assignment of shares to employees  collaborators  directors (e.g. to service incentive plans based on company's shares); in such cases  different criteria may be used  in line with the objectives pursued and taking into account the pro tempore market practices in force  the indications of Borsa Italiana S.p.A and the Consob recommendations. The treasury share buyback plan started on 27 April 2023 therefore ends today and the new plan is launched at the same time. As of April 29  2024  TIP held a total of no. 18 861 098 treasury shares equal to 10.230% of the share capital.

The positive 18-month efficacy and safety results announced recently illustrate the strong therapeutic potential of Batten 1. We are currently exploring various funding options to begin the trial that should enable us to gain approval for Batten-1. At the same time  we are continuing our research with the AlstroSight project team and Inserm Transfert to identify and characterize novel  innovative therapeutic targets for rare neurological diseases. In the same vein  in collaboration with Diverchim and Inserm's ARNA laboratory  we are sponsoring the PickASO project which aims to develop an innovative drug candidate  the first antisense oligonucleotide targeting the TFEB protein regulating autophagy. Our ambition is to broaden and enhance our portfolio of products in the field of rare neurological diseases with significant unmet medical needs”  explained Theranexus Chairman and CEO  Mathieu Charvériat.2023 annual financial results (French GAAP)€K 2023 2022 Turnover - - Operating income 319 1 246 Other purchases and external charges 5 076 3 967 Wages and social security charges 2 600 3 165 Amortization and depreciation of fixed assets 256 332 Other operating expenses 31 39 Operating expenses 7 963 7 503 Net operating income/(expenses) (7 644) (6 257) Net financial income/(expense) 14 (158) Non-recurring expenses - (771) Income tax 802 619 Net income/(expense) (6 828) (6 567)The 2023 full-year results were approved by the company's Board of Directors on 29 April 2024 and were the subject of a report by the company's Statutory Auditors.As in 2022  operating income for 2023 (€319 K) mainly consisted of operating grants: in particular €239 K awarded by BPI France for the balance of the PSPC Neurolead project  and €52 K funded by ANR for the NI2D project co-developed with CERMEP.Other external charges (€5 076 K in 2023 compared with €3 967 K in 2022) mainly included R&D costs incurred by the company. The increase recorded is due to the study purchases and research services item relating to the continuation of the Phase I/II clinical trial for Batten-1. The trial began in the first half of 2022  with progressive recruitment of patients during 2022  which explains the lower 2022 expenses compared to 2023.Wages and salaries registered a significant decline between 2022 and 2023  falling from €3 165 K to 2 600 K. This substantial decline is due to the departure of two staff members who are yet to be replaced  the end of apprenticeship and internship contracts  and the absence of variable salary components for the 2023 financial year (unlike in 2022 during which bonuses were paid).Amortization and depreciation costs for 2023 were €256 K compared to €332 K in 2022.The net financial result for 2023 benefited from interest rates that were higher than during the previous year  and therefore rose as a result of interest on cash investments.The major part of the €802 K tax income is due to Research Tax Credit (CIR). For 2023  Research Tax Credit stood at €785 K. The calculation includes grants and repayable advances received for the NeuroLead project  which are deducted from the expenses eligible under the program. Research Tax Credit was €583 K for 2022.Cash position as of 31 March 2024On 31 March 2024  total available funds stood at €3.1 M  which added to the expected payments due (final PSPC Neurolead payment  reimbursement of the 2023 Research Tax Credit)  will cover cash requirements until early Q2 2025.The company is considering different solutions to fund its activity beyond that date:A partnership agreement for its most advanced drug candidate Batten-1; and/orA capital raise.Arrival of Christine Placet as Chief Financial Officer“Moreover  we are delighted to welcome Christine Placet as our new Chief Financial Officer who takes over from Thierry Lambert. We sincerely thank Thierry  who supported the company since its IPO  for his strong commitment and we wish him all the very best for his future endeavors. Christine joined Theranexus in early April. Her solid experience in the financing and running of biotech companies such as Trophos and Coave Therapeutics for some twenty years are undeniable assets for the financial running of Theranexus and the company's development strategy” concluded Theranexus Chairman and CEO  Mathieu Charvériat.Christine Placet graduated from Kedge Business School. After 8 years' experience with Ernst and Young  and 9 years of financial management in SMEs  in 2004 she joined the biotech Trophos as Chief Financial Officer and subsequently Chair of the Board of Directors until the company was sold to the Roche group for €470 M in 2015. In 2016  Christine Placet was appointed CEO of the biotech company Horama (now Coave Therapeutics). After two funding rounds of €4 M and €22 M  and initial product entry into the development phase  she recruited her successor to devote time to consulting from 2021 onwards. She joined Theranexus as Chief Financial Officer in April 2024.Highlights of 2023 and Q1 2024In January 2023 the company and its partner BBDF presented initial safety and pharmacokinetic results achieved in the Phase I/II trial to evaluate Batten-1 in Batten disease. After a 9-week course with the maximum dose of 600 mg/day in six patients with juvenile Batten disease (CLN3) aged 17 and over  Batten-1 showed good user safety and tolerability  and a pharmacokinetic profile in line with expectations.In February 2023 the company formed a project team for rare neurological diseases  jointly with INRIA  Claude Bernard University Lyon 1 and Hospices Civils de Lyon.In May 2023 Theranexus and its partner BBDF won approval from the FDA (American health authorities) on efficacy endpoints for the future Phase III trial to evaluate Batten-1 in Batten disease (CLN3)  then in June won the same approval from the European Medicines Agency (EMA).In July 2023 the company raised funds of roughly €3.1 million through the issuance of 2 412 511 new shares. The American Beyond Batten Disease Foundation took a 11.6% stake in the company (on a non-diluted post-fundraising basis).In June and September 2023  the company and BBDF announced highly promising interim results after 6 and 12 months of treatment in the Phase I/II trial for Batten disease (CLN3) with a reduction in neurofilaments (a neuronal death biomarker) and stabilization of motor symptoms for treated patients in comparison to the decline expected with the natural disease course.The positive final 18-month safety and efficacy data announced on 18 April 2024 also showed stabilization of motor symptom progression in young adult patients. These results are highly encouraging for patients and their families  and in collaboration with BBDF and the clinical trial investigators the company has implemented an Expanded Access Program (EAP) to enable the 6 trial patients to continue receiving the treatment in view of its highly favorable risk-benefit profile.The company does not currently have the funds to begin the pivotal Phase III trial in Europe and the United States for patients with juvenile Batten disease before the end of 2024. It should secure funding  for example via one or a combination of the following routes: an industrial partnership  the issuance of shares or other securities giving access to capital  debt or non-dilutive funding (grants  repayable advances  etc.). Theranexus is considering all these options to have the resources required for its development.Lastly  the PickASO project sponsored by Theranexus  and its partners Diverchim and Inserm's ARNA laboratory received government support via the ""Innovations in biotherapies and biomanufacturing"" call for proposals under the France 2030 investment plan. The project will receive a €4.7 M  3-year funding package broken down into grants and repayable advances. PickASO aims to produce a revolutionary autophagy activation therapy with the development of a novel antisense oligonucleotide  an innovative drug candidate targeting TFEB  the protein identified as an autophagy regulator.About TheranexusTheranexus is an innovative biopharmaceutical company that emerged from the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (CEA).

Management will hold a conference call at 18:00 pm (CET) today  available via webcast (https://ir.exclusive-networks.com/). A replay will be available on our website. All figures relate to this period unless otherwise stated.12Jesper Trolle  Chief Executive Officer  commented:“Exclusive Networks has delivered a solid start to the year  with 7% growth1 in Gross sales in Q1-24  mostly driven by continued momentum in our EMEA business. This is a robust outcome in light of the macroeconomic backdrop and the exceptional impact of the supply chain in the first quarter of 2023.Acquisitions remain an important growth lever for Exclusive Networks  having completed more than 20 deals in the last decade. This quarter we announced the strategic acquisition of NextGen that will provide us critical mass in Australia and New Zealand  and strengthen our value proposition thanks to their wide array of services.We remain committed to exploring ways of accelerating our growth and expanding our market potential through strategic acquisitions that broaden our portfolio and geographic footprint.The evolving threat environment  influenced by geopolitical tensions  international conflicts  the adoption of generative AI  and regulatory demands for increased disclosure of cyberattacks  continues to position cybersecurity as a top priority for business leaders worldwide.As previously indicated  growth is expected to accelerate in the second half due to ongoing demand for cybersecurity and our scalable model supports our confidence in meeting our guidance for 2024.”GROSS SALES AT GROUP AND REGIONAL LEVELS – HIGHLIGHTSin € million Q1-23 Q1-24 Variation Reported Constant Currency* EMEA 925 1 009 +9% +10% AMERICAS 140 141 +1% +2% APAC 115 105 -9% -6% GROUP 1 180 1 255 +6% +7%* Variation at constant currency is computed using Q1-23 rates applied to Q1-24 Gross sales. The USD  GBP and PLN evolved as follows: 1EUR: 1.086 USD; 1EUR: 0.856 GBP  1EUR: 4.332 PLN respectively for Q1-24 and 1EUR: 1.073 USD; 1EUR: 0.883 GBP  1EUR: 4.709 PLN respectively for Q1-23.IFRS Revenuein € million Q1-23 Q1-24 Variation Reported Constant Currency* EMEA 291 298 +2% +3% AMERICAS 53 57 +7% +9% APAC 54 38 -29% -27% GROUP 399 393 -1% -0%* Variation at constant currency is computed using Q1-23 rates applied to Q1-24 IFRS Revenue.Gross sales were €1 255 million  an increase of 6.4% year over year on a reported basis (up 7% at constant currency). The majority of this growth (3.8%) was driven by existing vendor relationships in geographies where we already operate. The balance of our growth came from vendor expansion  partly through the expansion of existing vendors into new geographies (0.9%) and partly from new vendor relationships (0.7%) and also through M&A (1.0%).Gross sales mix grew towards Software licenses and Support & Maintenance  in line with the strategy in place and confirming the relevance of the value proposition. Hardware decreased to 24% of the Group’s sales (vs 27% in Q1-23)  Software was 50% (vs 47% in Q1-23) and Support & Maintenance stood at 26% (26% in Q1-23).Cloud-based business accounted for 34% of the Group’ sales in Q1-24  up 6 points compared to Q1-23  in line with the digital growth strategy in place.IFRS Revenue takes into account the recognition of the sales of Software licenses and Support & Maintenance on a Net margin basis as per IFRS as Exclusive Networks is not the primary obligor for these solutions. IFRS Revenue reached €393 million  down 1% on a reported basis due to the high basis of comparison of Q1-23 Hardware sales  with Hardware decreasing in our sales mix.Vendor and Customer retention rates1 remained above 100%  reflecting the continued engagement of our channel partners. Net vendor retention rate3 on a rolling 12-month basis at Q1-24 was at 108% (vs. 126% in Q1-23) and Net customer retention rate1 on a rolling 12-month basis at Q1-24 was at 108% (vs. 123% in Q1-23).EMEA (80% of Q1 2024 Gross sales): Gross sales were €1 009 million  up 9% reported and up 10% at constant currency. EMEA benefited from a continued healthy demand  reflecting the strong positioning of the Group in the Region.AMERICAS (11% of Q1 2024 Gross sales): Gross sales were €141 million  up 1% reported and up 2% at constant currency after a 50% reported growth performance in Q1-23.APAC (8% of Q1 2024 Gross sales): Gross sales were €105 million  down 9% reported and down 6% at constant currency  confirming the stabilization in the Region and a continued sequential improvement on the back of a high basis of comparison.OUTLOOKAmid the current environment still challenged by macroeconomic volatility (inflation  interest rates  geopolitical uncertainties)  the Group is aiming to achieve for the FY-24:Gross sales growth in a range between 10% and 12% at constant currency.growth in a range between 10% and 12% at constant currency.

The clinical data presented at ASH last December  regarding our product candidates UCART22 and UCART20x22  both manufactured in-house  are very encouraging and show high expansion potency and a high preliminary response rate. UCART22 manufactured in-house  compared to UCART22 manufactured by an external CDMO  shows meaningful superiority at a lower dose. These results show the major advantage we have in the market: the control of our production from A to Z to deliver highly potent reproducible product candidates.Regarding UCART20x22  preliminary results presented at ASH showed one partial and two complete metabolic responses in patients who have failed prior autologous CD19 CAR T-cell therapies. These data support the continued study of UCART20x22 in r/r B-cell NHL ” said André Choulika  Ph.D.  CEO of Cellectis.“In Q4 2023  Cellectis entered into strategic collaboration and investment agreements with AstraZeneca. We are very proud of our partnership to design and develop the next generation of cell and gene therapy medicines with one of the most respected pharmaceutical companies. This collaboration will allow Cellectis and AstraZeneca to join forces and advance potentially breakthrough innovations in the cell and gene therapy space.This year  Cellectis will continue to break new ground in the field of allogeneic cell therapy and we will provide regular updates in the advancements of our programs.”________________________1 Cash position includes cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and fixed-term deposits classified as current -financial assets.

The poster presentation highlights the following data: In vitro comparability studies suggested that the new process used by Cellectis to manufacture in-house UCART22 (“UCART22 P2”) resulted in a more potent product than the process used by the external CDMO to manufacture UCART22 (“UCART22 P1”). As of July 1 st   2023  3 patients were enrolled into the first UCART22 P2 cohort at dose level 2 (1 million cells/kg). UCART22 P2 was administered after fludarabine  cyclophosphamide  and alemtuzumab (FCA) lymphodepletion and was well tolerated. No DLTs or ICANS were observed  and the CRS observed was Grade 1 or 2. There was a higher preliminary response rate (67%) at dose level 2 for UCART22 P2 compared to a 50% response rate with a dose 5 times higher of UCART22 P1 (dose level 3). UCART22 expansion was observed in the responding patients and correlated with response and increases in serum cytokines and inflammatory markers.The study continues to enroll patients with UCART22 P2.NaThaLi-01 (evaluating UCART20x22) in relapsed or refractory B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (r/r B-NHL)On December 9  2023  Cellectis presented a poster at the ASH Annual Meeting with the initial first-in-human preliminary results from the NatHaLi-01 trial  a Phase 1/2a dose-finding and expansion study evaluating UCART20x22 in r/r B-cell NHL. The poster presentation highlights the following data:As of July 1 st   2023  3 patients were enrolled and treated at dose level 1 (50 million cells flat dose). Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) Grade 1 or 2 occurred in all patients  and all CRS resolved with treatment. No immune effector cell associated neurotoxicity (ICANS) or graft versus host disease (GvHD) was observed. There were no UCART20x22 DLTs  and there was 1 DLT related to CLLS52 (alemtuzumab).  2023  3 patients were enrolled and treated at dose level 1 (50 million cells flat dose). Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) Grade 1 or 2 occurred in all patients  and all CRS resolved with treatment. No immune effector cell associated neurotoxicity (ICANS) or graft versus host disease (GvHD) was observed. There were no UCART20x22 DLTs  and there was 1 DLT related to CLLS52 (alemtuzumab). All patients responded at Day 28  with 1 partial metabolic response and 2 complete metabolic responses in patients who had failed prior autologous CD19 CAR T-cell therapies.UCART20x22 expansion correlated with response and increases in serum cytokine and inflammatory marker levels as well as with CRS.These initial data support the continued study of UCART20x22 in r/r B-cell NHL and the study continues to enroll patients.AMELI-01 (evaluating UCART123) in relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukemia (r/r AML)On May 17  2023  Cellectis presented an oral presentation at the American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy (ASGCT) 2023 Annual Meeting that was an encore of the clinical data on the AMELI-01 clinical trial that were unveiled at an oral presentation at the ASH 2022 Annual Meeting. These preliminary data supported the continued administration of UCART123 after FCA lymphodepletion in patients with r/r AML. The study continues to enroll patients.MELANI-01 (evaluating UCARTCS1) in relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (r/r MM)In April 2023  we announced our decision to stop enrollment and treatment of patients with UCARTCS1 under the MELANI-01 Study.Research Data & Preclinical ProgramsTALEN® Editing Process for Gene Correction and Gene Insertion in HSPCsOn April 10  2024  Cellectis published a scientific article in Molecular Therapy  demonstrating that TALEN-mediated intron editing of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) enables transgene expression restricted to the myeloid lineage.

On October 31  2023  Cellectis presented preclinical data on MUC1-CAR T-cells to overcome key challenges of targeting solid tumors in a poster session at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer’s 38th Annual Meeting (SITC). The preclinical data presented highlight the capability of multi-armored allogeneic CAR T-cells to preserve their activity despite the immunosuppressive microenvironment  while mitigating potential safety concerns.Multiplex engineering for superior generation of efficient CAR T-cellsOn May 17  2023  Cellectis presented preclinical data in a poster on multiplex engineering for superior generation of CAR T-cells  at the ASGCT Annual Meeting. In the presentation  Cellectis shows that we can use the state-of-the-art TALEN® technology to precisely edit up to four loci simultaneously while delivering several additional payloads to increase the efficacy and persistence of CAR T-cells.HBB gene correction of sickle cell mutationOn June 5  2023  preclinical data on gene editing process using Cellectis TALEN® technology to develop highly efficient HBB gene correction of sickle cell mutation  were presented in a poster at the International Society for Cell and Gene Therapy (ISCT) 2023 Annual Meeting. These results showed that non-viral DNA delivery associated with TALEN® gene editing reduces the toxicity usually observed with viral DNA delivery and allows high levels of HBB gene correction in long-term repopulating hematopoietic stem cells.TALE Base Editors (TALE-BE)On June 5  2023  a comprehensive analysis to better design efficient TALE Base Editors (TALE-BE) using Cellectis’ TALEN® technology was presented in a poster at ISCT 2023 Annual Meeting. Cellectis developed a strategy that allowed to comprehensively characterize editing efficiencies in function of the TC position within the TALE-BE editing windows. This method is specifically taking advantage of the highly precise and efficient TALEN® mediated ssODN knock-in in primary T cells  allowing to focus on how target composition and spacer variations can affect TALE-BE activity/efficiency.On October 25  2023  Cellectis presented a comprehensive analysis of TALE-BE editing determinants at the European Society of Gene and Cell Therapy (ESGCT) 30th annual congress. Cellectis believes that the knowledge presented will help ensure that genome editing-based strategies are skillfully designed to minimize the risk of potential genotoxic events  overall expanding the potential of TALE-BE for nuclear and mitochondrial therapeutic cell engineering.TALEN-mediated HBB gene correction strategyOn October 24  2023  Cellectis presented preclinical data on its program of gene therapy for HSPC at the European Society of Gene and Cell Therapy ( ESGCT ) 30th annual congress.at the European Society of Gene and Cell Therapy ( ) 30th annual congress. Intronic editing enables lineage specific expression of therapeutics relevant for HSPC gene therapy.TALEN®-mediated intron editing of the CD11b locus results in the lineage-specific expression of a reporter transgene in myeloid cells  with negligible expression in HSPC or other cellular subsets in vitro and in vivo.Cellectis believes this intron editing approach could be disruptive in HSPC gene therapy and brain delivery of multiple therapeutics.Article published in Frontiers BioengineeringOn May 12  2023  Cellectis published an article in Frontiers Bioengineering demonstrating the efficacy of its TALEN® engineered FAP UCART-cells in cancer-associated fibroblast (CAF) depletion  reduction of desmoplasia and tumor infiltration. Over 90% of epithelial cancers including breast  colorectal  pancreatic and lung adenocarcinomas express the CAF-specific surface marker  fibroblast activation protein α (FAP)  which makes it a promising CAR T-cell target. In this study  Cellectis proposed a novel and versatile approach of combination CAR T-cell therapy that can be extended to most stroma-rich cold tumors with relevant tumor-antigen targeting CAR T-cells which otherwise are recalcitrant to cell therapy.Article published in Molecular Therapy – Methods & Clinical DevelopmentOn October 12  2023  Cellectis announced the publication of a new research paper in Molecular Therapy – Methods & Clinical Development  demonstrating the efficacy of its TALEN-mediated gene correction of mutated PIK3CD gene in Activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta syndrome 1 (APDS1) T-cells.The study aims at exploring an alternative therapeutic strategy by correcting the mutated PIK3CD gene associated to APDS1 by gene editing. This article describes a TALEN®-mediated gene insertion strategy that allows targeted correction of the dominant gain-of-function mutation of the PIK3CD gene by insertion of a functional sequence in a precise manner. Results show efficient gene insertion in APDS1 patients’ T-cells  normalization of PI3K signaling and rescue of T-cell cytotoxic functions.PartnershipsCollaboration and Investment Agreements with AstraZenecaIn November 2023  Cellectis announced it has entered into (i) a joint research collaboration agreement (the “Collaboration Agreement”)  (ii) an investment agreement relating to an initial equity investment of $80 million (the “Initial Investment Agreement”)  and (iii) a subsequent investment agreement relating to an additional equity investment of $140 million  with AstraZeneca (the “Subsequent Investment Agreement”).Under the Collaboration Agreement  AstraZeneca Ireland (“AZ Ireland”) will leverage Cellectis’ proprietary gene editing technologies and manufacturing capabilities to design novel cell and gene therapy candidate products. As part of the Collaboration Agreement  25 genetic targets have been exclusively reserved for AZ Ireland  from which up to 10 candidate products could be explored for development. AstraZeneca will have an option for a worldwide exclusive license on the candidate products  to be exercised before IND filing. Cellectis’ clinical-stage assets  UCART22  UCART123 and UCART20x22 will remain under Cellectis’ ownership and control.Under the Initial Investment Agreement  AstraZeneca Holdings (“AZ Holdings”) made an initial equity investment of $80 million in Cellectis by subscribing for 16 000 000 ordinary shares  at a price of $5.00 per share (the “Initial Investment”). Following settlement and delivery of the new shares  AZ Holdings owned approximately 22% of the share capital  and 21% of the voting rights of the Company.In addition to the Collaboration Agreement and the Initial Investment Agreement  on November 14  2023  the Company and AZ Holdings entered into the Subsequent Investment Agreement. Under the Subsequent Investment Agreement  AZ Holdings will make a further equity investment in Cellectis of $140 million by subscribing for two newly created classes of convertible preferred shares of Cellectis: 10 000 000 “class A” convertible preferred shares and 18 000 000 “class B” convertible preferred shares  in each case at a price of $5.00 per share (the “Additional Investment”). Until they convert into ordinary shares  the “class A"" convertible preferred shares would have single voting rights and would not carry any double voting rights  and the “class B” would carry no voting rights except on any distribution of dividends or reserves. Both classes of preferred shares would enjoy a liquidation preference (if any liquidation surplus remains after repayment of Cellectis’ creditors and of par value to all shareholders) and would be convertible into the same number of ordinary shares with the same rights as the outstanding ordinary shares. All the conditions precedents to the closing are met and the closing should occur on the earlier of (i) the third business day following the approval by the Cellectis' board of directors of the Company's annual and consolidated account for the financial year ended on December 31  2023  and (ii) May 7  2024 or such other date as may be agreed in writing by the parties.Immediately following the Additional Investment  it is anticipated that AZ Holdings would own approximately 44% of the share capital of the Company and 30% of the voting rights of the Company (based on the number of voting rights outstanding immediately after the completion of the Initial Investment) and as per the Company's shareholders decision dated December 22  2023  Mr. Marc Dunoyer and Dr. Tyrell Rivers will serve on the Company's board of directors as members designated by AZ Holdings. Further  certain business decisions are subject to AZ Holdings’ approval  including  in particular  winding up any company of the Cellectis group  issuing securities senior to or pari passu with the convertible preferred shares or any shares without offering AstraZeneca the option to purchase its pro rata share of such securities (subject to customary exceptions  including issuances under employee equity incentive plans)  declaring or paying dividends  prepaying indebtedness before due  and disposing of any material assets concerning gene editing tools or manufacturing facilities and selling  assigning  licensing  encumbering or otherwise disposing of certain material IP rights.Licensed Allogeneic CAR T-cell Development ProgramsAnti-CD19 programsAllogene’s AlloCAR T™ oncology programs utilize Cellectis technologies. ALLO-501 and cemacabtagene ansegedleucel are anti-CD19 products being developed under a collaboration agreement between Servier and Allogene based on an exclusive license granted by Cellectis to Servier. Servier grants to Allogene exclusive rights to ALLO-501 and cemacabtagene ansegedleucel in the U.S.Allogene announced it continues to focus on the development of its investigational product cemacabtagene ansegedleucel  or cema-cel (previously known as ALLO-501A) as part of the first line (1L) treatment plan for LBCL patients who are likely to relapse following 1L chemoimmunotherapy  in the ALPHA3 1L consolidation trial. Allogene announced start-up activities for the ALPHA3 trial are underway and the trial is expected to begin in mid-2024.In the first quarter  Allogene further announced it began enrollment in the ALPHA2 trial of the investigational product cema-cel in patients with relapsed/refractory (r/r) Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL).Allogene: anti-CD70 programThe anti-CD70 program is licensed exclusively from Cellectis by Allogene and Allogene holds global development and commercial rights to this program.Allogene announced it has developed and implemented a diagnostic and treatment algorithm that may mitigate the treatment-associated hyperinflammatory response without compromising the CAR T function needed to eradicate solid tumors in its solid tumor trial with ALLO-316 in renal cell carcinoma (RCC).Corporate UpdatesFinancingOn January 4  2023  we entered into an amendment to the sales agreement  dated as of March 29  2021  with Jefferies LLC with respect to an equity offering program under which we may offer and sell ADS having an aggregate offering price of up to $60.0 million from time-to-time following January 4  2023  through Jefferies as our sales agent. As of the date of this Annual Report  we have not sold any ADS under the amended program subsequent to such date. We decided to discontinue the ATM.In February 2023  Cellectis announced (i) the completion of its offering by way of a capital increase  of 8 800 000 American Depository Shares (ADS)  each representing one ordinary share with a par value of 0.05 euro each (the “Offering”)  which had been launched on February 2  2023 and (ii) the exercise by the underwriting banks  Jefferies LLC and Barclays Capital Inc.  of their option (the “Option”) to purchase an additional 1 107 800 ordinary shares (the “Additional Ordinary Shares”) of the Company to be delivered in the form of 1 107 800 ADSs. Following the Offering and the Option exercise  the total number of ordinary shares issued in the form of ADSs amounts to 9 907 800  bringing the gross proceeds of the Offering and Option to approximately $24 769 500 (€22 695 162.18) and the aggregate net proceeds  after deducting underwriting commissions and estimated offering expenses  to approximately $22 783 330 (€20 875 325.27).Calyxt and Cibus Merger AgreementOn May 31  2023  Calyxt  Inc. (“Calyxt”) completed its all-stock  reverse merger business combination with Cibus Global  LLC (“Cibus”). Following the closing of this merger  effective on June 1  2023  the combined company operates under the name of Cibus  Inc.. Cellectis’ equity interest in Calyxt was reduced to 2.9% after the closing of the Merger  which resulted in Cellectis losing control of Calyxt.Drawdown of 2 first tranches of the European Investment Bank financingOn April 4  2023  Cellectis announced it entered into the warrant agreement (the “Warrant Agreement”) and finalized the related ancillary documents required under the credit facility with the European Investment Bank (“EIB”) for up to €40 million previously announced on December 28  2022. The Company also announced the drawdown of the first tranche of €20 million (“Tranche A”) under the Finance Contract  that has been disbursed by the EIB in early April 2023. Cellectis plans to use the proceeds of Tranche A towards the development of its pipeline of allogeneic CAR T-cell product candidates: UCART22  UCART20x22  UCART123.On January 16  2024  Cellectis announced the drawdown of the second tranche of €15 million (“Tranche B”) under the credit facility agreement for up to €40 million entered into with the European Investment Bank (the “EIB”) on December 28  2022 (the “Finance Contract”). The Company plans to use the proceeds of Tranche B towards the development of its pipeline of allogeneic CAR T-cell product candidates: UCART22  UCART20x22  and UCART123.Shareholders General MeetingDuring its meeting held on June 27  2023  the shareholders of the Company appointed Mrs. Cécile Chartier as director of the Company’s board of directors. At the end of the meeting  the terms of office of Ms. Annick Schwebig and Mr. Hervé Hoppenot ended and Ms. Annick Schwebig and Mr. Hervé Hoppenot departed the board of directors as of such date.During its meeting held on December 22  2023  the shareholders of the Company approved the Additional Investment of AstraZeneca.2023 Financial ResultsThe annual consolidated financial statements of Cellectis have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards  as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IFRS”).On January 13  2023  Calyxt  Cibus  and certain other parties named therein  entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”)  pursuant to which  subject to the terms and conditions thereof  Calyxt and Cibus will merge in an all-stock transaction (the “Calyxt Merger”). As a consequence of the foregoing  Calyxt met the “held-for-sale” criteria specified in IFRS 5 and was classified as a discontinued operation until May 31  2023.On June 1  2023  Calyxt and Cibus closed the merger transaction and now operate under the name Cibus  Inc. Consequently  Calyxt was deconsolidated and Calyxt's cash  cash equivalent and restricted cash are no longer included in the Group's cash  cash equivalent and restricted cash since June 1  2023.As from June 1  2023 and the deconsolidation of Calyxt  which corresponded to the Plants operating segment  we view our operations and manage our business in a single operating and reportable segment corresponding to the Therapeutics segment. For this reason  we are no longer presenting financial measures broken down between our two reportable segments - Therapeutics and Plants. The results of Calyxt until the date of deconsolidation are isolated under “Income (loss) from discontinued operations” in the appendices of this Q4 and full year 2023 financial results press release.Cash: As of December 31  2023  Cellectis had $156 million in consolidated cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and fixed-term deposits classified as current-financial assets.This compares to $95 million in consolidated cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash as of December 31  2022. This $61 million increase is driven by cash inflows including the $80 million proceeds related to the AstraZeneca Initial Investment  a $23 million net cash inflow from the capital raise closed in February  the $25 million upfront payment related to AstraZeneca Collaboration Agreement  a $2 million net cash inflow from licenses  a $21 million net cash inflow from the EIB loan  $6 million received from research tax credit prefinancing  a $3 million cash inflow related to the grant and refundable advance from BPI  $4 million of financial investments’ capital gain and interests and $1 million reimbursement of social charges paid on stock options. Our cash position is also impacted by a $2 million favorable impact of foreign exchange. These cash inflows are partially offset by $105 million of cash outflows  which include $32 million for R&D suppliers  $16 million for SG&A suppliers  $40 million for staff costs  $11 million for lease payments and $5 millions of reimbursement of the “PGE” loan.With cash and cash equivalents of $137 million and a $15 million term deposit maturing in May 2024 classified as a current financial asset as of December 31  2023  and taking into account the €15 million under Tranche B of the €40 million Finance Contract with EIB received in January 2024  the Company believes its cash runway is extended into the third quarter of 2025 and therefore will be able to operate for at least twelve months following the consolidated financial statements’ publication.Pursuant to the Subsequent Investment Agreement with AstraZeneca  and the shareholders' approval on December 22  2023  Cellectis is eligible to receive a payment of $140 million in the form of an equity transaction. All the conditions precedents to the closing are met and the closing of the Subsequent Investment should occur on the earlier of (i) the third business day following the approval by the Cellectis' board of directors of the Company's annual and consolidated account for the financial year ended on December 31  2023  and (ii) May 7  2024 or such other date as may be agreed in writing by the parties. Assuming the receipt of the additional $140 million  the Company expects that its cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund its operation into 2026.Revenues and Other Income: Consolidated revenues and other income were $9.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31  2023 compared to $25.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31  2022. This $16.5 million decrease between the twelve months ended December 31  2023 and 2022 was mainly attributable to (i) the recognition of a $15.8 million milestone from a licensee in 2022  (ii) the recognition of two milestones under Cellectis’ agreement with Cytovia for an aggregate of $1.5 million in 2022 and (iii) the recognition of $1.0 million related to the change of control of a licensee pursuant to the terms of its license agreement with Cellectis and the amendment to such license agreement in 2022  while revenues recognized for the year ended December 31  2023 are mainly related to Iovance research collaboration and exclusive license agreement.R&D Expenses: Consolidated R&D expenses were $87.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31  2023  compared to $97.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31  2022. The $9.9 million decrease between the twelve months of 2023 and 2022 was primarily attributable to (i) a decrease of purchases  external expenses and other by $4.4 million (from $54.9 million in 2022 to $50.5 million in 2023) mainly relating to lower consumables purchases and subcontracting expenses due to continuing internalization of our manufacturing and quality activities to support our R&D pipeline  (ii) personnel expenses decreased by $5.5 million (from $42.6 million in 2022 to $37.2 million in 2023) primarily due to headcounts decrease in 2022 and 2023.SG&A Expenses: Consolidated SG&A expenses were $16.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31  2023 compared to $17.5 million for the twelve months ended December 31  2022. The $0.7 million decrease primarily reflects (i) a $0.4 million decrease in purchases  external expenses and other (from $9.8 million in 2022 to $9.4 million in 2023) (ii) a $0.3 million decrease in personal expenses.Other operating income and expenses: Other operating income and expenses were a $1.3 million net expense for the twelve months ended December 31  2023 compared to a $1.4 million net income for the twelve months ended December 31  2022. The $2.7 million increase in net expenses primarily reflects (i) the recognition of costs related to a commercial litigation for $0.5 million  (ii) the unfavorable outcome of the litigation with the French administration which led to the reimbursement of $0.7 million of research tax credit and the provision for risk of $0.5 million related to 2015 and 2016 research tax credit and (iii) the favorable outcome of a claim with the French social tax authorities regarding tax on stock options for $1.0 million that was a one-time item recognized in 2022.Net financial gain (loss): Consolidated net financial loss was a $19.2 million for the twelve months ended December 31  2023  compared to a $8.9 million loss for the twelve months ended December 31  2022. The $10.2 million difference reflects mainly (i) an increase in gain from our financial investments of $2.5 million and (ii) a $4.3 million difference in the loss on change in fair value of Cytovia’s note receivable (from a $12.1 million loss in 2022 to a $7.8 million loss in 2023)  partially offset by (i) the loss on change in fair value on our retained investment in Calyxt since deconsolidation for $5.9 million  (ii) a $5.7 million loss on change in fair value of the derivative instrument recognized on the Subsequent Investment Agreement with AstraZeneca  (iii) a $2.4 million loss on change in fair value of the EIB warrants  (iv) a $1.9 million increase of interest expense on our borrowings and (v) a $1.7 million decrease in net foreign exchange gain.Net income (loss) from discontinued operations:Net income (loss) from discontinued operations includes Calyxt loss until deconsolidation and profit from deconsolidation. All tables referring to the year-end period ended December 31  2023 present Calyxt’s results over a five-month period from January 1  2023 to May 31  2023. Net income from discontinued operations was $8.4 million for the twelve months ended December 31  2023  compared to a net loss of $15 3 million for the twelve months ended December 31  2022.The $23.7 million difference is primarily driven by (i) a $22.6 million profit from Calyxt’s deconsolidation recognized in 2023 and (ii) Calyxt's $8.5 million net loss in the third and fourth quarter of 2022 compared with $0 in the third and fourth quarter of 2023 as Calyxt was deconsolidated  partially offset by a $7.3 million increase in the net loss over the first two quarters between 2022 and 2023. This $7.3 million increase breaks down as follows: (i) an increase of $9.2 million of net financial loss and (ii) a $1.9 million decrease of operating loss  the decrease of operating expenses being partially offset by restructuring and merger transaction costs.Net Income (loss) Attributable to Shareholders of Cellectis: The consolidated net loss attributable to shareholders of Cellectis was $101.1 million (or $1.77 per share) for the twelve months ended December 31  2023  of which $116.8 million was attributed to Cellectis continuing operations  compared to $106.1 million (or $2.33 per share) for the twelve months ended December 31  2022  of which $98.7 million was attributed to Cellectis continuing operations. This $5.1 million decrease in net loss attributable to shareholders of Cellectis between the twelve months of 2023 and 2022 was primarily driven by (i) a $9.9 million decrease of research and development   (ii) a $0.7 million decrease of SG&A expenses and (iii) a $23.2 million increase in profit from discontinued operations attributable to shareholders of Cellectis (from a $7.5 million loss in 2022 to $15.8 million profit in 2023)  partially offset by (i) a decrease of $16.5 million of revenues and other income  (ii) an increase in other operating expenses of $2.7 million and (iii) an increase in net financial loss of $10.2 million.Adjusted Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Shareholders of Cellectis: The consolidated adjusted net loss attributable to shareholders of Cellectis was $94.0 million (or $1.65 per share) for the twelve months ended December 31  2023  compared to a net loss of $98.1 million (or $2.15 per share) for the twelve months ended December 31  2022.Please see ""Note Regarding Use of Non-IFRS Financial Measures"" for reconciliation of GAAP net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis to adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis.We currently foresee focusing our cash spending at Cellectis for 2023 in the following areas:Supporting the development of our pipeline of product candidates  including the manufacturing and clinical trial expenses of UCART123  UCART22  UCART20x22 and potential new product candidates  andOperating our state-of-the-art manufacturing capabilities in Paris (France)  and Raleigh (North Carolina  USA); andContinuing strengthening our manufacturing and clinical departments.CELLECTIS S.A.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION($ in thousands  except per share data) As of December 31 2022 December 31 2023 ASSETS Non-current assets Intangible assets 718 671 Property  plant  and equipment 63 621 54 681 Right-of-use assets 44 275 38 060 Non-current financial assets 8 791 7 853 Total non-current assets 117 406 101 265 Current assets Trade receivables 772 569 Subsidies receivables 14 496 20 900 Other current assets 9 078 7 722 Cash and cash equivalent and Current financial assets 97 697 203 815 Total current assets 122 043 233 005 Total assets held for sale 21 768 0 TOTAL ASSETS 261 216 334 270 LIABILITIES Shareholders’ equity Share capital 2 955 4 365 Premiums related to the share capital 583 122 522 785 Currency translation adjustment (28 605 ) (36 690 ) Retained earnings (333 365 ) (304 707 ) Net income (loss) (106 139 ) (101 059 ) Total shareholders’ equity - Group Share 117 968 84 695 Non-controlling interests 7 973 0 Total shareholders’ equity 125 941 84 695 Non-current liabilities Non-current financial liabilities 20 531 49 125 Non-current lease debts 49 358 42 948 Non-current provisions 2 390 2 200 Deferred tax liabilities 0 158 Total non-current liabilities 72 279 94 431 Current liabilities Current financial liabilities 5 088 5 289 Current lease debts 7 872 8 502 Trade payables 21 456 19 069 Deferred revenues and deferred income 59 110 325 Current provisions 477 1 740 Other current liabilities 13 179 10 219 Total current liabilities 48 131 155 144 Total liabilities related to asset held for sale 14 864 0 TOTAL LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY 261 216 334 270Cellectis S.A.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONSFor the three-month period ended December 31  2023 (unaudited)$ in thousands  except per share amounts For the three-month period endedDecember 31  2022(unaudited) 2023(unaudited) Revenues and other income Revenues 16 024 283 Other income 1 298 1 707 Total revenues and other income 17 322 1 990 Operating expenses Cost of revenue (690 ) (167 ) Research and development expenses (21 433 ) (25 526 ) Selling  general and administrative expenses (1 698 ) (4 671 ) Other operating income (expenses) 728 (1 204 ) Total operating expenses (23 094 ) (31 568 ) Operating income (loss) (5 772 ) (29 578 ) Financial gain (loss) (19 955 ) (12 210 ) Income tax (87 ) (6 ) Income (loss) from continuing operations (25 813 ) (41 795 ) Income (loss) from discontinued operations (2 744 ) (0 ) Net income (loss) (28 558 ) (41 795 ) Attributable to shareholders of Cellectis (26 814 ) (41 795 ) Attributable to non-controlling interests (1 744 ) (0 ) Basic and diluted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis  per share ($/share) (0.59 ) (0.64 ) Basic and diluted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis from discontinued operations  per share ($ /share) (0.02 ) (0.00 )Cellectis S.A.CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONSFor the year ended December 31  2023$ in thousands  except per share amounts For the year ended December 31  2022 2023 Revenues and other income Revenues 19 171 755 Other income 6 553 8 438 Total revenues and other income 25 725 9 193 Operating expenses Cost of revenue (1 772 ) (737 ) Research and development expenses (97 501 ) (87 646 ) Selling  general and administrative expenses (17 494 ) (16 812 ) Other operating income (expenses) 1 377 (1 300 ) Total operating expenses (115 390 ) (106 495 ) Operating income (loss) (89 666 ) (97 302 ) Financial gain (loss) (8 935 ) (19 163 ) Income tax (87 ) (371 ) Income (loss) from continuing operations (98 688 ) (116 835 ) Income (loss) from discontinued operations (15 345 ) 8 392 Net income (loss) (114 034 ) (108 443 ) Attributable to shareholders of Cellectis (106 139 ) (101 059 ) Attributable to non-controlling interests (7 894 ) (7 384 ) Basic and diluted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis  per share ($/share) (2.33 ) (1.77 ) Basic and diluted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis from discontinued operations  per share ($ /share) (0.16 ) 0.28Note Regarding Use of Non-IFRS Financial MeasuresCellectis S.A. presents adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis in this press release. Adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis is not a measure calculated in accordance with IFRS. We have included in this press release a reconciliation of this figure to net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis  which is the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with IFRS. Because adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis excludes Non-cash stock-based compensation expense—a non-cash expense  we believe that this financial measure  when considered together with our IFRS financial statements  can enhance an overall understanding of Cellectis’ financial performance. Moreover  our management views the Company’s operations  and manages its business  based  in part  on this financial measure.In particular  we believe that the elimination of Non-cash stock-based expenses from Net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of our core businesses. Our use of adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders of Cellectis has limitations as an analytical tool  and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our financial results as reported under IFRS. Some of these limitations are: (a) other companies  including companies in our industry which use similar stock-based compensation  may address the impact of Non-cash stock- based compensation expense differently; and (b) other companies may report adjusted net income (loss) attributable to shareholders or similarly titled measures but calculate them differently  which reduces their usefulness as a comparative measure.

Clear financial framework: Revised medium-term objectives with new revenue classification aligned to strategic focus  while adopting a disciplined approach to capital management.Hans Leybaert  Chief Executive Officer and founder  commented:""Following a detailed review of our business model  we are pleased to outline our refined strategic priorities with a clear focus on driving our core digital services. As digital transformation accelerates across our industry  we are streamlining our portfolio by divesting traditional services that are less relevant to our future. Our platform  allied to the flexibility offered by our modular approach to meet client demands  positions us strongly to capture opportunities in the short term and the benefits of incoming regulatory reforms. We have set ambitious yet realistic short and mid-term goals in line with our strategic objectives.""Strategic updateIn 2023  we conducted a strategic review of the business model and assessed our core digital services i.e. e-identity  e-invoicing  e-payments and e-reporting  and our traditional communication service  i.e. our document data extraction  print and mail and paper-based services.As digital transformation accelerates  the need for traditional communication services is decreasing. We are streamlining our portfolio to focus on the core digital services given the increased demand for complete digital solutions. As a result  our portfolio rationalisation is underway and several of our traditional communication services will potentially be divested in case opportunities arise. In this respect  we are in the process of divesting FitekIN and ONEA  i.e. two stand-alone products. This transaction is expected to be finalised in Q2 2024. In addition we have entered into exclusive negotiations in the Nordics. More information can be found on our press release which we issued at 7:00 this morning. Finally  we are currently making progress on other smaller divestment projects and signed several non-disclosure agreements in this respect. Potential proceeds from these divestment initiatives will be used to reduce net debt and strengthen our cash position.Unifiedpost offers (i) an all-in-one solution for micro- enterprises and SMEs that consolidates financial tasks into one platform and (ii) an API integrations for our corporate clients under the brand name Banqup. Alongside this  eFaktura was launched in Serbia in 2023  our government licensable solution. Our solutions' modular capability provides the flexibility to meet specific customer requirements and broaden our target market.We are focused on organically growing in this segment through our current footprint  upsells and upgrades  market share gains  and partner network strategy.Our platform also positions us optimally for the upcoming regulatory wave which provides further upside opportunities to support scalability across multiple markets.Financial frameworkRevenue reclassificationWe have reclassified our revenue segments to align with our strategic focus on the core digital services. Our previous revenue breakdown consisted of Digital Processing revenues (recurring and non-recurring) and Postage & Parcel optimisation revenue  where Digital Processing included core and hybrid services. Under the new reporting structure  the breakdown will be Digital services which represents our core business  and Traditional Communication services which represents hybrid digital and paper-based services.Cash flow commitmentsWe remain committed to improving our cash flow position. The cost-cutting measures implemented over the last two years provide us with an improved foundation for future cash flow generation. This will be supported by EBITDA growth driven by organic revenue growth in our core digital services and higher gross margins in this division as well as a stabilised capex spend.Our capital expenditure  in absolute terms  will be maintained at the level of the full year 2023  to facilitate strategic growth initiatives. Capex / Digital services revenue ratio is expected to decrease from 25-27% in FY 2023 towards ~6-7% in the mid-term.FY 2024 objectives:Digital Service revenue growth: low teensAttaining free cash flow1 breakeven under the current group structure (i.e. Pre disinvestments)Medium-term objectives:Organic Digital Service revenue base case (Ex-regulation) Revenue CAGR: mid-teens percentage growth Drive gross margin close to ~70% Capex as a ratio of Digital services revenue around 6-7%Regulation booster to be further quantified when mandatory laws in different countries are implemented.Investors & Media webcastManagement will host a live video webcast for analysts  investors and media today at 2:00pm to 4:00pm CET.A recording will be available shortly after the event.
