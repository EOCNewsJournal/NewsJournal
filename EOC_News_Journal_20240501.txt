These issues impact our local communities  destinations and  ultimately  our business. With this in mind  we are committed to significantly reducing our water footprint ౼ 40% of which is generated through our direct operations  such as the usage of in-room showers and taps  and 60% through upstream activities  mainly associated with Food & Beverage purchases.Discover How 3 Hotels Around the World Tackle this ChallengeMövenpick Petra  Jordan: Reducing Water Consumption in a Water-Scarce EnvironmentThis 5-star resort is located in one of the world’s most water-scarce countries. With this in mind  between 2020 and 2022  the Mövenpick Petra converted 90% of its rooms from bathtubs to walk-in showers. During the transition  water consumption dropped from 45M liters in 2019 to 43M liters in 2022. By the end of 2023  consumption dropped again to 33M liters ౼ a 25% decrease compared to 2022. This progress has not only positively impacted the hotel’s water conservation efforts  but also generated overwhelming support from staff and clients alike.Sofitel Noosa Pacific Resort  Australia: Responsible Reuse of RainwaterLocated in a picturesque coastal oasis  nature is always top of mind at Sofitel Noosa Pacific Resort. In an effort to shrink its environmental footprint  the resort partnered with Ecotourism Australia and earned the Sustainable Tourism Certification in November 2023. Over the years  the resort has put in place a wide range of sustainable initiatives focusing on energy and water conservation  reducing food and material waste and eliminating single-use plastics. Notably  they've designed a rainwater capture system to conserve water. This system captures and stores 16 800 liters of rainwater in the basement car park and supplies the hotel’s irrigation and pool systems.Novotel Itu Terras de São José Golf & Resort  Brazil: Reclaiming GreywaterSustainability was woven into the very design of the Novotel Itu Terras de São José Golf & Resort  with features like solar water heating  a VRF air conditioning system and rainwater and greywater capture systems. Notably  the on-site Grey Water Treatment Plant treats wastewater from guest room showers and sinks. In 2023 alone  they reclaimed and reused an impressive 4.4M liters of greywater from 343 guest rooms for irrigation  guest toilets and various outdoor areas.Going further on our longstanding commitment to water conservation  in 2023  we formalized our Group Water Policy with specific focus on water management practices (water quantity  water quality and access to water  sanitation and hygiene) – ensuring consistent water stewardship across all Accor hotels  segments and regions. Our comprehensive water strategy integrates technical solutions to boost efficient water use  adopts a fresh perspective on the Food & Beverage value chain  and sparks a shift in guest habits.We also look beyond our own operations and actively collaborate with other actors to tackle shared environmental and social challenges. Signing the CEO Water Mandate is our latest step in raising industry standards for water stewardship. This UN coalition unites us with like-minded organizations  focusing on continual progress across six key areas: direct operations  supply chain  collective action  public policy  community engagement and transparency.Click here to learn more about our Water strategyAbout Accor  a world-leading hospitality groupAccor is a world leading hospitality group offering experiences across more than 110 countries in 5 500 properties  10 000 food & beverage venues  wellness facilities or flexible workspaces.

As was previously disclosed on 26 February 2024  the Bond Trustee  with approval from a majority of the Bondholders  may further extend the Bonds on a month to month basis to 29 November 2024.Due to the seasonality of Solis' business  approximately 70% of its revenues are received during the summer period. Therefore  first quarter incomes are normally insufficient to pay the full interest amount that is due. As a result  Solis will now make an interest payment of EUR 1 000 000 (€1 million)  which is approximately 50% of the total interest due for the first quarter of 2024. The remaining interest amount will be paid alongside  and in addition to  the next interest payment due 6 July 2024 from Solis' ongoing business operations. Solis will incur a late payment penalty in accordance with the Bond Terms  which will also be paid on 6 July 2024.About Alternus Energy Group:The Company is a transatlantic clean energy independent power producer (IPP).

Exprivia - The Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting of Exprivia S.p.A. - a company listed on the Euronext Milan market of Borsa Italiana [XPR.MI] - which met today in first call  approved the merger project (the ""Merger Project"") by incorporation of Exprivia into Abaco3 S.p.A. (""Abaco3"") (the ""Merger"")  previously approved by the Board of Directors of Exprivia and the Sole Director of Abaco3  on March 27  2024. The Merger is part of the business strategy initiated with the promotion  by Abaco Innovazione S.p.A. (""Abaco Innovazione"")  through Abaco3  of the voluntary  all-inclusive tender offer  targeting all the ordinary shares of Exprivia (the ""Offer"")  aimed at achieving the delisting on Euronext Milan  a regulated market organized and managed by Borsa Italiana  of Exprivia's shares (the ""Delisting""). The Delisting  in fact  will enable Exprivia to: (i) eliminate the costs arising from the listing; (ii) obtain greater managerial and governance flexibility; and (iii) free up economic and financial resources to devote to the enhancement of the value of the equity investments held  as well as to any further extraordinary operations and/or corporate and business reorganization that may be deemed appropriate and/or in line with the growth and development objectives of Exprivia and Abaco3. The completion of the Merger is expected to take place during the third quarter of 2024. The Merger was resolved using as reference balance sheets (i) for Abaco3  of the draft financial statements as of December 31  2023  approved by the Sole Director of Abaco3 on March 11  2024  and (ii) for Exprivia  in accordance with Article 2501-quater  paragraph 2  of the Civil Code  of the draft consolidated financial statements as of December 31  2023  approved by the Board of Directors on March 11  2024.

The Merger will take civil law effect as of the last of the registrations prescribed by Article 2504bis of the Civil Code or the later date indicated in the Merger Deed. Please note that  as illustrated in the Merger Project  the exchange ratio has been determined as follows: no. 0.0273060882078 ordinary shares of Abaco3 S.p.A.  with a par value of Euro 1.00 each  for no. 1 ordinary share of Exprivia S.p.A. with a par value of Euro 0.52 each. Just for the sake of clarity  it is represented that this ratio corresponds to 36.62 ordinary shares of Exprivia S.p.A. 1PRESS RELEASE with a par value of Euro 0.52 for every 1 ordinary share of Abaco3 S.p.A. with a par value of Euro 1.00. As a result of and in execution of the Merger  Abaco3 will carry out a share capital increase of up to Euro 814 771.00 by issuing up to 814 771 shares to service the exchange. In detail  the Merger will be implemented by: cancellation without exchange of the 5 719 207 Exprivia ordinary shares held by Exprivia itself as of December 31  2023 (or the different number of shares that will be held as of the effective date of the Merger) and the 16 326 329 Exprivia ordinary shares held by Abaco3 (or the different number of shares that will be held as of the effective date of the Merger) as of the date of the Merger plan; cancellation with exchange (to the extent of the Exchange Ratio) of the Exprivia ordinary shares outstanding on the effective date of the Merger  other than those indicated under (i).The shares issued by Abaco3 in exchange for the Exprivia shares cancelled as a result of the Merger will have regular dividend entitlements and  therefore  will grant their holders rights equivalent to those due to the holders of Aabco3 shares outstanding at the time of their issuance.Where necessary  a service will also be made available to Exprivia's shareholders to enable them to obtain a full number of Abaco3 shares  due in application of the exchange ratio  at market prices and without incurring expenses  stamp duty or commissions. It should also be noted that: the Merger qualifies as a significant transaction under Article 70 of CONSOB Regulation 11971/99 (""Issuers'Regulation"")  and the parameters of significance provided for merger transactions under Attachment 3B of the Issuers' Regulation  Issuers as it involves the merger of a share issuer  i.e.  Exprivia  into a company that does not have shares admitted to a regulated market  i.e.  Abaco3; and the Merger qualifies as a transaction of greater significance according to the criteria set forth in Annex 3 of the Regulation on Related Party Transactions adopted by Consob with Resolution No. 17221 of March 12  2010 (the ""RPT Regulation""). The Company  therefore  availing itself of the option provided by Article 7.2.4 of its RPT Procedure  proceeded to prepare a single disclosure document  both for the purposes of Article 70 of the Issuers' Regulations and Article 5 of the RPT Regulations and Article 7.2 of Exprivia's RPT Procedure (the ""Disclosure Document"")  which was made available to shareholders and the public within the terms and in the manner provided by applicable regulations  on April 3  2024. It should be recalled that  in light of the fact that the Merger constitutes a related party transaction of ""greater significance"" under the RPT Regulations  the aforementioned Merger involved Exprivia's Integrated Internal Committee (acting as the committee for related party transactions)  which unanimously expressed a favorable opinion on the existence of an interest for Exprivia in the execution of the Merger  as well as on the convenience and substantial fairness of the terms and conditions of the Merger project  on March 25  2024. Said opinion is attached to the Information Document. 2PRESS RELEASE As already disclosed to the market  the shareholders of the Company who did not concur to the resolution approving the Merger would be entitled to the right of withdrawal pursuant to Articles 2437  paragraph 1  letter g) and 2437- quinquies of the Italian Civil Code (the ""Right of Withdrawal"")  resulting from the Merger resolution  inter alia  the elimination of the list voting mechanism pursuant to Article 147-ter TUF  as well as the exclusion from listing of Exprivia's shares.

This site  which is to be located in the heart of the French Alps where the 2030 Winter Olympics will be held  should also contribute to a sustainable model of winter tourism. This is the first agreement in Europe to replace fossil fuels with green hydrogen in the stainless steel sector.As part of its roadmap for decarbonising its business  Swiss Steel Group  one of the world's largest producers  processors and distributors of long special steel products  has decided to use green hydrogen at the Ugitech plant in Ugine  to replace the natural gas used in some of its thermoprocessing equipment (burners  reheating furnaces  heat treatment furnaces  etc.) and thus decarbonise part of its industrial processes. The steelmaker  which produces around 200 000 tonnes of steel a year  has selected Lhyfe to support it in this energy transition. This project could avoid emitting 16 000 tonnes of CO2 a year[1].Lhyfe  which is signing its first memorandum of understanding with a steel manufacturer  already has three production sites and is currently building several sites in Europe.Plans to produce up to twelve tonnes per day to decarbonise Ugitech's operations and develop hydrogen mobility in the regionLhyfe plans to install a green hydrogen production unit with a capacity up to twelve tonnes per day (a maximum electrolysis capacity of 30 MW)  at Ugitech's Ugine plant. This green hydrogen would be used mainly at the Ugitech plant  supplied via a pipeline. Lhyfe would also supply hydrogen to local mobility and industry players  to help develop the local hydrogen ecosystem  particularly in the run-up to the 2030 Winter Olympics.The two partners are now entering the feasibility study phase of the project. Implementation of the project will be subject to the conclusions of this study  the granting of operating licences and building permits  and financial investment decisions.Philippe Desorme  Vice Chief Executive Officer at Lhyfe: “We are delighted to sign this memorandum of understanding with Ugitech  whose commitment to decarbonisation we commend. The steel sector is a major consumer of fossil fuels and is one of the industrial sectors that should be decarbonised as a priority. The energy transition is going to become increasingly necessary to ensure the long-term survival of our industries  and green hydrogen is emerging as one of the pillars of this transition. It can and must now be deployed as quickly as possible  including in the steel sector.”Frédéric Perret  Director of Development at Ugitech: “Ugitech is coordinating the HYDREAMS project  which aims to demonstrate the feasibility of substituting natural gas with decarbonised hydrogen in thermal steel transformation processes (reheating and heat treatment furnaces). HYDREAMS has nine European partners and has received a grant from the European RFCS fund. Using laboratory tests and industrial demonstrators  this project  which started in April 2023 and ends in October 2027  will verify that hydrogen combustion will have no negative impact on processes and products. The next step is to roll out this new solution to all systems for which direct electrification is not a compatible option. This is the purpose of this MoU with Lhyfe.”About LhyfeLhyfe is a European group devoted to energy transition  and a producer and supplier of green and renewable hydrogen. Its production sites and portfolio of projects intend to provide access to green and renewable hydrogen in industrial quantities  and enable the creation of a virtuous energy model capable of decarbonising entire sectors of industry and transport.In 2021  Lhyfe inaugurated the 1st industrial-scale green hydrogen production plant in the world to be interconnected with a wind farm.

The steelmaker  which produces around 200 000 tonnes of steel a year  has selected Lhyfe to support it in this energy transition. ThisNantes and Ugine (France)  30 April 2024  7:30 am - Lhyfe (EURONEXT: LHYFE)  one of the world's pioneers in the production of green and renewable hydrogen  and Ugitech  a subsidiary of Swiss Steel Group  the world leader in long stainless steel products  have announced the signing of a memorandum of understanding for the creation of a green hydrogen production unit at Ugitech's Ugine site (Savoie  France)  to decarbonise part of the steelmaker's industrial operations and help decarbonise local mobility. This site  which is to be located in the heart of the French Alps where the 2030 Winter Olympics will be held  should also contribute to a sustainable model of winter tourism. This is the first agreement in Europe to replace fossil fuels with green hydrogen in the stainless steel sector.project could avoid emitting 16 000 tonnes of CO2 a year1.Lhyfe  which is signing its first memorandum of understanding with a steel manufacturer  already has three production sites and is currently building several sites in Europe.Plans to produce up to twelve tonnes per day to decarbonise Ugitech's operations and develop hydrogen mobility in the regionLhyfe plans to install a green hydrogen production unit with a capacity up to twelve tonnes per day (a maximum electrolysis capacity of 30 MW)  at Ugitech's Ugine plant. This green hydrogen would be used mainly at the Ugitech plant  supplied via a pipeline. Lhyfe would also supply hydrogen to local mobility and industry players  to help develop the local hydrogen ecosystem  particularly in the run-up to the 2030 Winter Olympics.The two partners are now entering the feasibility study phase of the project. Implementation of the project will be subject to the conclusions of this study  the granting of operating licences and building permits  and financial investment decisions.Philippe Desorme  Vice Chief Executive Officer at Lhyfe: ""We are delighted to sign this memorandum of understanding with Ugitech  whose commitment to decarbonisation we commend. The steel sector is a major consumer of fossil fuels and is one of the industrial sectors that should be decarbonised as a priority. The energy transition is going to become increasingly necessary to ensure the long-termsurvival of our industries  and green hydrogen is emerging as one of the pillars of this transition. It can and must now be deployed as quickly as possible  including in the steel sector.""Frédéric Perret  Director of Development at Ugitech: ""Ugitech is coordinating the HYDREAMS project  which aims to demonstrate the feasibility of substituting natural gas with decarbonised hydrogen in thermal steel transformation processes (reheating and heat treatment furnaces). HYDREAMS has nine European partners and has received a grant from the European RFCS fund. Using laboratory tests and industrial demonstrators  this project  which started in April 2023 and ends in October 2027  will verify that hydrogen combustion will have no negative impact on processes and products. The next step is to roll out this new solution to all systems for which direct electrification is not a compatible option. This is the purpose of this MoU with Lhyfe.""About LhyfeLhyfe is a European group devoted to energy transition  and a producer and supplier of green and renewable hydrogen.

Regulatory preparedness: A robust technological platform provides a strong platform to capture regulatory upside opportunities.A robust technological platform provides a strong platform to capture regulatory upside opportunities. Clear financial framework: Revised medium-term objectives with new revenue classification aligned to strategic focus  while adopting a disciplined approach to capital management.Hans Leybaert  Chief Executive Officer and founder  commented:""Following a detailed review of our business model  we are pleased to outline our refined strategic priorities with a clear focus on driving our core digital services. As digital transformation accelerates across our industry  we are streamlining our portfolio by divesting traditional services that are less relevant to our future. Our platform  allied to the flexibility offered by our modular approach to meet client demands  positions us strongly to capture opportunities in the short term and the benefits of incoming regulatory reforms. We have set ambitious yet realistic short and mid-term goals in line with our strategic objectives.”Strategic updateIn 2023  we conducted a strategic review of the business model and assessed our core digital services i.e. e-identity  e-invoicing  e-payments and e-reporting  and our traditional communication service  i.e. our document data extraction  print and mail and paper-based services.As digital transformation accelerates  the need for traditional communication services is decreasing. We are streamlining our portfolio to focus on the core digital services given the increased demand for complete digital solutions. As a result  our portfolio rationalisation is underway and several of our traditional communication services will potentially be divested in case opportunities arise. In this respect  we are in the process of divesting FitekIN and ONEA  i.e. two stand-alone products. This transaction is expected to be finalised in Q2 2024. In addition we have entered into exclusive negotiations in the Nordics. More information can be found on our press release which we issued at 7:00 this morning. Finally  we are currently making progress on other smaller divestment projects and signed several non-disclosure agreements in this respect. Potential proceeds from these divestment initiatives will be used to reduce net debt and strengthen our cash position.Unifiedpost offers (i) an all-in-one solution for micro- enterprises and SMEs that consolidates financial tasks into one platform and (ii) an API integrations for our corporate clients under the brand name Banqup. Alongside this  eFaktura was launched in Serbia in 2023  our government licensable solution. Our solutions' modular capability provides the flexibility to meet specific customer requirements and broaden our target market.We are focused on organically growing in this segment through our current footprint  upsells and upgrades  market share gains  and partner network strategy.Our platform also positions us optimally for the upcoming regulatory wave which provides further upside opportunities to support scalability across multiple markets.Financial frameworkRevenue reclassificationWe have reclassified our revenue segments to align with our strategic focus on the core digital services. Our previous revenue breakdown consisted of Digital Processing revenues (recurring and non-recurring) and Postage & Parcel optimisation revenue  where Digital Processing included core and hybrid services. Under the new reporting structure  the breakdown will be Digital services which represents our core business  and Traditional Communication services which represents hybrid digital and paper-based services.Cash flow commitmentsWe remain committed to improving our cash flow position. The cost-cutting measures implemented over the last two years provide us with an improved foundation for future cash flow generation. This will be supported by EBITDA growth driven by organic revenue growth in our core digital services and higher gross margins in this division as well as a stabilised capex spend.Our capital expenditure  in absolute terms  will be maintained at the level of the full year 2023  to facilitate strategic growth initiatives. Capex / Digital services revenue ratio is expected to decrease from 25-27% in FY 2023 towards ~6-7% in the mid-term.FY 2024 objectives:Digital Service revenue growth: low teensAttaining free cash flow1 breakeven under the current group structure (i.e. Pre disinvestments)Medium-term objectives:Organic Digital Service revenue base case (Ex-regulation) Revenue CAGR: mid-teens percentage growth Drive gross margin close to ~70% Capex as a ratio of Digital services revenue around 6-7%Regulation booster to be further quantified when mandatory laws in different countries are implemented.Investors & Media webcastManagement will host a live video webcast for analysts  investors and media today at 2:00pm to 4:00pm CET.A recording will be available shortly after the event.

40254,EuroNext,Bing API,https://businessmirror.com.ph/2024/05/01/ireland-now-has-zero-female-listed-ceos/,Ireland now has zero female listed CEOs,Ireland has become one of only two European Union states to have no women leading any of its listed companies  in a setback for a country that has become known for achieving rapid social change in recent decades.,Ireland has become one of only two European Union states to have no women leading any of its listed companies  in a setback for a country that has become known for achieving rapid social change in recent decades.Since Margaret Sweeney retired Tuesday as chief executive officer of Ireland’s biggest private residential landlord Irish Residential Properties REIT Plc  all 31 companies listed on Euronext Dublin’s website are to be headed by a man.Overall the picture isn’t much brighter across the EU for women in leadership positions with it being common for even large stock exchanges to have less than a handful of female CEOs. However  Ireland  with a population of 5 million  will be an outlier from Wednesday  when Eddie Byrne succeeds Sweeney as CEO.Almost every other EU country  except the small state of Luxembourg  has at least one woman at the top of a listed company  according to analysis by Bloomberg. All other member states have female CEOs  besides Slovakia  which has one company  Biotika AS  run by three directors including a woman  and Philip Morris’s Czech out posting  led by a female managing director who is set to be replaced by a man in June  according to a company statement.Only 8 percent of CEO positions at the largest listed companies in the EU28 in 2023 were women  according to the European Institute for Gender Equality. It’s a bleak insight into the state of gender equality in corporate Europe  and now especially in Ireland  which has become a poster child for progressing in a short stint of time.Even in similarly sized Scandinavian countries women are scarce in top roles  despite their progressive reputations. Sweden’s main OMX Stockholm 30 index was earlier this year left with only one female CEO among 30 after a series of resignations among women in top roles  including fast-fashion giant H&M AB’s Helena Helmersson and phone carrier Telia AB’s Alison Kirkby. Both were replaced by men.The lack of gender equality at the top of companies listed on Ireland’s exchange is exacerbated by the fact it is dominated by traditionally male-heavy industries like construction  said Gillian Harford  Ireland’s country executive at 30 percent Club  a campaign group that aims to increase female representation on company boards. Euronext Dublin boasts large caps such as Ryanair Holdings Plc. and Kingspan Group Plc.The picture in the US is only slightly better  with 10 percent female CEOs on the Fortune 500 in 2023  according to Fortune. Globally  quotas have been set for improving board diversity  although most appear not to specifically target the top job. The EU has mandated that non-executive boards of listed companies must consist of women. The US’s Nasdaq sets board targets too. In Ireland  the government set a 33 percent target for women on boards by the end of 2023.“Where the represented base is already small  sustainment has to depend on succession planning  and that’s where we see the gender power gap becoming most prevalent ” Harford said. “Until we achieve constant focus on succession and gender balance across all functional roles  and remove or reduce the gender power gap it will be a challenge to maintain momentum on gender progress at CEO level.”While there has been progress on achieving equality at board level in Ireland  the lack of a female CEO in a listed company shows there is much to be done to shatter the glass ceiling. A government-led report from November 2023 showed female board representation stood at 39 percent  up from 18% five years earlier.Outside of listed companies  Ireland has a burgeoning startup scene that appears to attract more women than the public companies. It was the third in Europe for investment in women-led startups  according to financial research firm PitchBook. However  many of those companies have decided not to IPO in Ireland so far  a wider struggle for Euronext Dublin which has seen some of its most well-established companies including Flutter Entertainment Plc flock to larger pools of capital in the US.“Right along the scaling escalator we have specific strategic initiatives to support and ensure that the correct policies are in place to encourage a pipeline of strong female managers and female founders to come through the ecosystem ” said Jenny Melia  executive director at government business agency Enterprise Ireland. “There certainly is a big focus on it here in Ireland.” Bloomberg,neutral,0.04,0.9,0.06,negative,0.02,0.14,0.84,True,English,"['zero female listed CEOs', 'Ireland', 'fast-fashion giant H&M AB', 'Irish Residential Properties REIT Plc', 'biggest private residential landlord', 'main OMX Stockholm 30 index', 'two European Union states', 'other member states', 'Ryanair Holdings Plc.', 'Flutter Entertainment Plc', 'rapid social change', 'Czech out posting', 'Kingspan Group Plc', 'burgeoning startup scene', 'financial research firm', 'specific strategic initiatives', 'large stock exchanges', 'strong female managers', 'chief executive officer', 'gender power gap', 'female managing director', 'government business agency', 'female board representation', 'one female CEO', 'largest listed companies', 'other EU country', '10 percent female CEOs', 'Telia AB', 'European Institute', 'female representation', 'executive director', 'campaign group', 'large caps', 'female founders', 'one company', 'country executive', 'gender balance', 'board diversity', 'board targets', 'board level', 'listed company', 'Gender Equality', 'recent decades', 'Euronext Dublin', 'leadership positions', 'Eddie Byrne', 'Biotika AS', 'three directors', 'Philip Morris', 'company statement', 'CEO positions', 'bleak insight', 'poster child', 'short stint', 'Scandinavian countries', 'Helena Helmersson', 'phone carrier', 'Alison Kirkby', 'male-heavy industries', 'constant focus', 'functional roles', 'CEO level', 'glass ceiling', 'government-led report', 'women-led startups', 'wider struggle', 'larger pools', 'scaling escalator', 'correct policies', 'Jenny Melia', 'big focus', 'one woman', '30 percent Club', '33 percent target', 'gender progress', 'company boards', 'non-executive boards', 'top roles', 'top job', 'public companies', 'Margaret Sweeney', 'small state', 'corporate Europe', 'Gillian Harford', 'succession planning', 'The US', 'Enterprise Ireland', '8 percent', '39 percent', '31 companies', 'setback', 'website', 'picture', 'less', 'handful', 'population', 'outlier', 'Wednesday', 'Luxembourg', 'analysis', 'Bloomberg', 'Slovakia', 'June', 'EU28', 'time', 'progressive', 'reputations', 'Sweden', 'series', 'resignations', 'lack', 'fact', 'construction', 'Fortune', 'quotas', 'Nasdaq', 'base', 'sustainment', 'challenge', 'momentum', 'November', 'investment', 'PitchBook', 'capital', 'place', 'pipeline', 'ecosystem']",2024-05-01,2024-05-01,businessmirror.com.ph
