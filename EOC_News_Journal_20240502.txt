Speculation is already buzzing about the future of Shell Plc’s presence on the London exchange  while signs this week of investor resistance to Glencore Plc’s proposed coal spinoff might reignite talk of a US listing.“Europe’s virtuous attitude when it comes to ESG norms  free trade or say on pay may have been naive at times in front of trading partners that put economic interests above all ” said Eric Meyer  head of RBC Capital Markets in France.A third of European mutual funds exclude fossil fuels  compared with a negligible number of their US peers with that view  Deutsche Bank AG analysts wrote in a March note  citing Morningstar Direct data. The divergence over environmental  social and governance measurements shows up in valuations  with TotalEnergies’ stock priced at eight times earnings expected a year from now  against 12 times for US giant Exxon Mobil Corp.And considerations over ESG are not the only factor for European resources companies weighing their options  said RBC Capital’s Meyer.“When there is a notable valuation gap between Wall Street and Europe  temptation is high to follow the money ” he said. “This is particularly true for the oil and gas industry  which is way more part of the fabric of the US economy  more populated and better followed by investors.”A representative for Euronext Paris  where Total is listed  declined to comment.For Glencore  European fund managers shunning coal is a pressing concern. Almost half of the region’s mutual funds exclude the dirtiest-burning fuel from their portfolios  the Deutsche Bank analysts noted. They warned that shareholder opposition to carving out its coal business could prompt Glencore to consider switching its listing to New York. Several of the mining and commodities trading giant’s largest shareholders favor retaining the coal assets  Bloomberg News reported Monday.“If the scenario of keeping coal were to materialize  it could have major implications for Glencore’s strategy  capital structure and capital availability at a pivotal time for London-listed mining companies ” JPMorgan Chase & Co. analyst Patrick Jones wrote in a note to clients Tuesday.Another storied commodities company’s European listing is also in peril.

Following the success o…,"Pontpierre  France  01 May 2024 - FDE (Euronext: FDE - ISIN: FR0013030152)  a carbon-negative energy producer  is proud to announce the issue of a third green bond to finance the development of its low-carbon energy portfolio in Norway and Europe. Following the success of its previous bond issues  the financing was provided by its long-term partner  Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management (EDRAM)  a leading energy and infrastructure investment fund.Major funding to support the development of new production sites in EuropeThis green bond will finance the Group's portfolio of existing energy solutions  and more specifically its deployment of cogeneration and solar farms in France and Belgium  as well as its promising LBG and Bio-CO 2 projects in France and Norway.The financing amounts to €60 million in three equal tranches of €20 million each  the first of which will be drawn down by 31 December 2024. The issue is being underwritten by BRIDGE  the infrastructure debt platform of EDRAM  a long-standing partner of FDE. This financing qualifies as a ""green bond"" and the issue has been valued in accordance with the principles applicable to Green Bonds of the ICMA (International Capital Market Association) via an opinion from EthiFinance  a recognized independent expert.Thanks to FDE's excellent existing cash flow generation  the strength of its balance sheet and the robustness of the business model of the various projects qualifying for this green bond  this debt instrument is classified as Investment Grade and therefore benefits from attractive rates over the 7-year term of the financing.This gives FDE the financial resources it needs to support and accelerate its development strategy and achieve all its objectives for 2026 and the longer-term targets to be announced at the Investor Day on 30 May 2024.A growth plan accelerating from the second half of 2024FDE is continuing its organic growth with the installation of four additional cogeneration plants in Hauts-de-France over the coming months  and is pursuing its photovoltaic development in France and Norway  in order to rapidly reach its target of 100 MW of installed capacity.FDE is also continuing its development in Norway with the launch of three projects to produce LBG and biogenic CO 2   for which the Group is awaiting the level of financial support to be granted by the Norwegian Agency for Ecological Transition  while at the same time moving ahead with the installation of a major 20 MW green hydrogen production site  dedicated to the maritime industry  at Agder in Norway.The completion of these main projects will make a major contribution in making FDE a leading independent European operator dedicated to carbon neutrality.A long-term partnership dedicated to the development of low-carbon energy production""The placement of this new green bond demonstrates Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management's confidence in FDE and its ability to achieve growth and profitability targets over the medium and long term. This transaction will enable the Group to finance all its current and future low-carbon projects in Norway and Europe and should facilitate the deployment of new energy production sites. We are extremely proud of the success of the long-term collaboration we have developed with Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management and would like to thank them for their ongoing support "" says Julien Moulin  Chairman of FDE.Jean-Francis Dusch  Managing Director of EDRAM UK  Investment Director of BRIDGE and Global Head of Infrastructure  Real Assets & Structured Finance said: ""EDRAM is very proud to renew its support for FDE  an emerging leader in low carbon energy solutions in Europe.

Recurring revenues (82%) up 7% organically; non-recurring revenues up 1% organically. Expert solutions revenues (59%) up 8% organically. Cloud software revenues (18%) up 16% organically.First-quarter adjusted operating profit margin increased.First-quarter adjusted free cash flow increased in constant currencies.Net debt-to-EBITDA was 1.4x as of March 31  2024.2024 share buyback: €353 million of intended share buyback of €1 billion completed in the year through April 29  2024.Nancy McKinstry  CEO and Chair of the Executive Board  commented: “We’ve had a good start to the year  with 6% organic growth and improvements in the margin and free cash flow. We continued to invest in scaling our expert solutions  rolling out several new products  and expanding into adjacent markets. And  we are increasing our investment in deploying artificial intelligence to bring benefits to customers. I am pleased to reiterate our full-year guidance.”First-quarter 2024 developmentsFirst-quarter revenues increased 5% in reporting currencies  reflecting organic growth of 6% (1Q 2023: 6%)  slightly offset by the impact of currency due to the weaker U.S. dollar compared to a year ago (average EUR/USD rate was €/$1.09 in 1Q 2024 versus €/$1.07 in 1Q 2023).Recurring revenues (82% of revenues)  which include subscriptions and other repeating revenue streams  sustained 7% organic growth (1Q 2023: 7%). Non-recurring revenues (18% of revenues) increased 1% organically  slowing slightly compared to a year ago (1Q 2023: 2%). Within non-recurring revenues  transactional revenues posted 3% organic growth (1Q 2023: 1% decline)  as Financial & Corporate Compliance transactional trends started to stabilize and Legal & Regulatory transactional revenues (ELM Solutions) remained strong. Organic growth in software license and implementation fees and other non-recurring revenues slowed to 1% (1Q 2023: 2%). The adjusted operating profit margin increased in the first quarter compared to first quarter 2023.Health revenues increased 7% in constant currencies and 7% organically (1Q 2023: 5%). Clinical Solutions delivered 9% organic growth (1Q 2023: 6%)  reflecting good renewal rates in clinical decision support and clinical drug information. Our referential drug data and patient engagement solutions (formerly Lexicomp and Emmi) were brought under the UpToDate brand. Health Learning  Research & Practice recorded 5% organic growth (1Q 2023: 3%)  benefitting from new journal launches  including NEJM AI  a title focused on AI in Medicine.Tax & Accounting revenues increased 6% in constant currencies  with organic growth of 8% (pro forma 1Q 2023: 9%) partly offset by the transfer of our Chinese legal research solution Bold (2023 revenues: €21 million) to the Legal & Regulatory division. North American organic growth slowed to 8% as expected (pro forma 1Q 2023: 11%) partly due to the challenging comparable created by last year’s tax guide publication schedule. Europe recorded a strong start to the year despite the absence of last year’s one-time benefits in Germany and Spain. Asia Pacific & Rest of World grew 2% organically (1Q 2023: 7%) as print books turned down.Financial & Corporate Compliance revenues grew 4% in constant currencies and 4% organically (pro forma 1Q 2023: 2%). Recurring revenues increased 6% organically (pro forma 1Q 2023: 5%). Transactional and other non-recurring revenues began to stabilize (1% organic increase in 1Q 2024 compared to pro forma decline of 4% in 1Q 2023) but remain difficult to predict. Legal Services grew 4% organically (pro forma 1Q 2023: 2%)  supported by sustained organic growth in service subscriptions alongside stable transactional revenues. Financial Services revenues grew 3% organically (pro forma 1Q 2023: 1%)  supported by 4% organic growth in recurring revenues and a slight upturn in transactional revenues compared to decline a year ago.Legal & Regulatory revenues grew 8% in constant currencies and 5% organically (pro forma 1Q 2023: 4%)  reflecting the transfer into the division of the Bold legal research solution from the Tax & Accounting division. Legal & Regulatory Information Solutions grew 4% organically (1Q 2023: 4%)  with sustained growth in digital products more than offsetting decline in print. Legal & Regulatory Software revenues grew 6% organically (pro forma 1Q 2023: 5%)  buoyed by sustained double-digit growth in volume-driven transactional revenues at ELM Solutions related to the on-boarding of new customers.Corporate Performance & ESG revenues grew 7% in constant currencies and 7% organically (pro forma 1Q 2023: 10%). Recurring revenues sustained double-digit organic growth  while non-recurring revenues declined in the quarter. Our EHS/ORM1 unit (Enablon) delivered 8% organic growth (1Q 2023: 22%)  driven by double-digit growth in recurring cloud subscriptions partly offset by decline in non-recurring software license fees against a challenging comparable. The CCH Tagetik Corporate Performance Management (CPM) platform delivered 13% organic growth (1Q 2023: 16%)  driven by Europe and Asia Pacific & ROW. Our corporate tax  internal audit (TeamMate)  and Finance  Risk & Reporting (OneSumX) units all recorded low single-digit organic growth in the quarter.Cash flow and net debtFirst quarter cash conversion declined compared to first quarter 2023  as expected  due to a working capital outflow in the quarter compared to an inflow in first quarter 2023. Adjusted free cash flow increased in constant currencies  mainly due to favorable timing of financing cost and tax paid in the quarter. A total of €252 million in cash was deployed towards share repurchases during the quarter. Net acquisition spending was negligible.Net debt was €2 499 million as of March 31  2024  compared to €2 612 million at December 31  2023. Net-debt-to-EBITDA  based on rolling twelve-months EBITDA  was 1.4x at the end of March 2024  compared to 1.5x at year-end 2023.In March  2024  we issued a new €600 million Eurobond with a 5-year term and 3.250% annual coupon.Shares outstanding  share buybacks  and dividendsAs of March 31  2024  the number of issued ordinary shares outstanding (excluding 9.3 million shares held in treasury) was 239.2 million.In the year to date (through April 29)  we have repurchased 2.5 million ordinary shares for a total consideration of €353 million (average share price €141.86). This includes a block trade of €48.0 million executed on February 22  2024  to offset the dilution caused by our incentive share issuance.For the period starting May 2  2024  up to and including December 27  2024  we have engaged third parties to execute approximately €647 million in share buybacks on our behalf  within the limits of relevant laws and regulations (in particular Regulation (EU) 596/2014) and Wolters Kluwer’s Articles of Association. For the period after November 10  2024  this mandate is subject to authorization by the AGM on May 8  2024. Share repurchases will be used for capital reduction purposes through share cancelation. The share repurchase program may be suspended  discontinued  or modified at any time.At the Annual General Meeting to be held on May 8  2024  shareholders will be asked to approve a total dividend of €2.08 over financial year 2023  an increase of 15% compared to the 2022 dividend. If approved  the final dividend of €1.36 per share will be paid to shareholders on June 4  2024 (ADRs: June 11  2024). The interim dividend for 2024 will be set at 40% of the 2023 total dividend.Sustainability developmentsAcross the group  the focus in early 2024 has been on reinforcing a range of initiatives that foster diversity  engagement  and belonging  including career development programs and employee networks. Our global real estate team began executing on plans to deliver a reduction in square meters of office space in 2024  while at the same time improving the quality of workspaces for employees. These plans will help us reach our SBTi2-validated targets.Full-year 2024 outlookOur group-level guidance for 2024  shown in the table below  is unchanged. We continue to expect sustained good organic growth in 2024  in line with the prior year  and a further modest increase in the adjusted operating profit margin. Due to phasing of investment expenses  margin improvement is expected to be modest in the first half.Full-Year 2024 Outlook Performance indicators 2024 Guidance 2023 Actual Adjusted operating profit margin* 26.4%-26.8% 26.4% Adjusted free cash flow** €1 150-€1 200 million €1 164 million ROIC* 17%-18% 16.8% Diluted adjusted EPS growth** Mid- to high single-digit 12% *Guidance for adjusted operating profit margin and ROIC is in reporting currency and assumes an average EUR/USD rate in 2024 of €/$1.09. **Guidance for adjusted free cash flow and diluted adjusted EPS is in constant currencies (€/$ 1.08). Guidance reflects share repurchases of €1 billion in 2024.In 2023  Wolters Kluwer generated over 60% of its revenues and adjusted operating profit in North America. As a rule of thumb  based on our 2023 currency profile  each 1 U.S. cent move in the average €/$ exchange rate for the year causes an opposite change of approximately 3 euro cents in diluted adjusted EPS3.We include restructuring costs in adjusted operating profit. We expect 2024 restructuring costs to be in the range of €10-€15 million (FY 2023: €15 million). We expect adjusted net financing costs4 in constant currencies to increase to approximately €60 million. We expect the benchmark tax rate on adjusted pre-tax profits to increase and to be in the range of 23.0%-24.0% (FY 2023: 22.9%).Capital expenditures are expected to remain at the upper end of our guidance range of 5.0%-6.0% of total revenues (FY 2023: 5.8%). We expect the full-year 2024 cash conversion ratio to be around 95% (FY 2023: 100%) due to lower net working capital inflows.Our guidance assumes no additional significant change to the scope of operations. We may make further acquisitions or disposals which can be dilutive to margins  earnings  and ROIC in the near term.2024 outlook by divisionOur guidance for 2024 organic revenue growth by division is summarized below. We expect the increase in full-year 2024 adjusted operating profit margin to be driven primarily by our Health  Legal & Regulatory  and Corporate Performance & ESG divisions. The Tax & Accounting margin is expected to decline slightly due to increased product investment.Health: we expect full-year 2024 organic growth to be in line with prior year (FY 2023: 6%).Tax & Accounting: we expect full-year 2024 organic growth to be slightly below prior year (FY 2023: 8%)  due to slower growth in non-recurring outsourced professional services and the absence of one-off favorable events in Europe.Financial & Corporate Compliance: we expect full-year 2024 organic growth to be in line with or better than prior year (FY 2023: 2%) as transactional revenues are expected to stabilize.Legal & Regulatory: we expect full-year 2024 organic growth to be in line with prior year (FY 2023: 4%).Corporate Performance & ESG: we expect full-year 2024 organic growth to be better than in the prior year (FY 2023: 9%) as Finance  Risk & Reporting revenues stabilize.About Wolters KluwerWolters Kluwer (EURONEXT: WKL) is a global leader in information  software solutions and services for professionals in healthcare; tax and accounting; financial and corporate compliance; legal and regulatory; corporate performance and ESG.

40276,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2024/05/01/ireland-left-with-zero-female-listed-ceos-after-ires-switch/,Ireland left with zero female listed CEOs after Ires switch,Country now one of two EU states with only men leading its public companies,Ireland has become one of only two European Union states to have no women leading any of its listed companies  even as it has become known for achieving rapid social change in recent decades.Since Margaret Sweeney retired on Tuesday as chief executive Ires Reit  all 31 companies listed on Irish Stock Exchange  now known as Euronext Dublin  are led by a man.The picture isn’t much brighter across the EU for women in leadership positions with it being common for even large stock exchanges to have less than a handful of female CEOs. Still  Ireland will be an outlier from today  now that Eddie Byrne has succeeded Sweeney as chief.Almost every other EU country  except the small state of Luxembourg  has at least one woman at the top of a listed company  according to analysis by Bloomberg. All other member states have female CEOs  besides Slovakia  which has one company run by three directors including a woman  and Philip Morris’s Czech out posting  led by a female managing director who is set to be replaced by a man in June  according to a company statement.READ MOREAbout 8 per cent of CEO positions at the largest listed companies in the EU28 in 2023 were women  according to the European Institute for Gender Equality. It’s a bleak insight into the state of gender equality in corporate Europe  and now especially in Ireland  which has become a poster child for progressing in a short stint of time.Even in similarly-sized Scandinavian countries women are scarce in top roles  despite their progressive reputations. Sweden’s main OMX Stockholm 30 index was earlier this year left with only one female CEO among its member companies after a series of resignations among women in top roles  including fast-fashion giant H&M’s Helena Helmersson and phone carrier Telia’s Alison Kirkby. Both were replaced by men.The lack of gender equality at the top of companies listed on the Irish exchange is exacerbated by the fact it is dominated by traditionally male-heavy industries like construction  said Gillian Harford  Ireland’s country executive at 30% Club  a campaign group that aims to increase female representation on company boards.The picture in the US is only slightly better  with 10 per cent female CEOs on the Fortune 500 in 2023. Globally  quotas have been set for improving board diversity  although most appear not to specifically target the top job. The EU has mandated that non-executive boards of listed companies must consist of women. The US’s Nasdaq sets board targets too. In Ireland  the Government set a 33 per cent target for women on boards by the end of 2023.“Where the represented base is already small  sustainment has to depend on succession planning  and that’s where we see the gender power gap becoming most prevalent ” Harford said. “Until we achieve constant focus on succession and gender balance across all functional roles  and remove or reduce the gender power gap it will be a challenge to maintain momentum on gender progress at CEO level.”While there has been progress on achieving equality at board level  the lack of a female chief executive in an Irish-listed company shows there is much to be done to shatter the glass ceiling. A Government-led report from November showed female board representation stood at 39 per cent  up from 18 per cent five years earlier. That included an 8 percentage point increase in the number of women taking up chief finance officer roles.Outside of listed companies  the burgeoning start-up scene here appears to attract more women than public companies. It was the third in Europe for investment in women-led start-ups  according to financial research firm PitchBook. Yet many of those companies have decided not to IPO in Ireland so far.“Right along the scaling escalator we have specific strategic initiatives to support and ensure that the correct policies are in place to encourage a pipeline of strong female managers and female founders to come through the ecosystem ” said Jenny Melia  executive director at Government business agency Enterprise Ireland. “There certainly is a big focus on it here.” – Bloomberg,neutral,0.03,0.89,0.08,mixed,0.11,0.29,0.61,True,English,"['zero female listed CEOs', 'Ireland', 'Ires', 'main OMX Stockholm 30 index', 'fast-fashion giant H&M', 'two European Union states', 'chief finance officer roles', '10 per cent female CEOs', 'rapid social change', 'large stock exchanges', 'other member states', 'Czech out posting', 'sized Scandinavian countries', '8 percentage point increase', 'burgeoning start-up scene', 'financial research firm', 'specific strategic initiatives', 'strong female managers', 'gender power gap', 'female managing director', '33 per cent target', 'Irish Stock Exchange', 'Government business agency', 'female chief executive', 'female board representation', 'one female CEO', 'other EU country', 'largest listed companies', 'female representation', '8 per cent', '39 per cent', 'European Institute', 'Irish exchange', 'country executive', 'executive director', 'female founders', 'functional roles', 'one company', 'CEO positions', 'CEO level', 'gender balance', 'member companies', 'board diversity', 'board targets', 'board level', 'listed company', 'top roles', 'Gender Equality', 'recent decades', 'Ires Reit', 'Euronext Dublin', 'leadership positions', 'Eddie Byrne', 'three directors', 'Philip Morris', 'company statement', 'bleak insight', 'poster child', 'short stint', 'progressive reputations', 'Helena Helmersson', 'phone carrier', 'Alison Kirkby', 'male-heavy industries', 'campaign group', 'constant focus', 'glass ceiling', 'Government-led report', 'women-led start-ups', 'scaling escalator', 'correct policies', 'Jenny Melia', 'big focus', 'one woman', 'gender progress', 'public companies', 'company boards', 'non-executive boards', 'top job', 'Margaret Sweeney', 'small state', 'corporate Europe', 'Gillian Harford', 'The US', 'succession planning', 'Enterprise Ireland', '18 per', '31 companies', 'Tuesday', 'picture', 'handful', 'outlier', 'today', 'Luxembourg', 'analysis', 'Bloomberg', 'Slovakia', 'June', 'READ', 'EU28', 'time', 'Sweden', 'series', 'resignations', 'Telia', 'lack', 'fact', 'construction', '30% Club', 'Fortune', 'quotas', 'Nasdaq', 'base', 'sustainment', 'challenge', 'momentum', 'November', 'number', 'investment', 'PitchBook', 'place', 'pipeline', 'ecosystem']",2024-05-01,2024-05-02,irishtimes.com
