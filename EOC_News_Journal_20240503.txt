Elvira Nabiullina in a statement assured people that Russia would remain financially stable even if the United States and its allies were to seize its frozen assets overseasThe U.S. and its allies have frozen approximately $300 billion worth of assets belonging to the Russian central bank as part of sanctions related to Russia's special military operation in Ukraine  with most of these assets held in the European Union.Recently  President Joe Biden signed a bill permitting the White House to seize roughly $6 billion in Russian state assets held in American banks. (Related: Switzerland confirms it holds $14.3 billion in FROZEN Russian assets.)Nabiullina stated at a news conference that the potential confiscation of gold and foreign exchange reserves would not impact the country's financial stability  as Russia ceased operations with these assets long ago and does not utilize them.She highlighted the Russian central bank's efforts to diversify its foreign exchange reserves over the years and emphasized that current operations involve reserves unaffected by sanctions  mitigating any potential risks to the country's financial stability.While the White House advocates for confiscating the funds to support Ukraine's war efforts against Russia  EU lawmakers and Group of 7 finance chiefs have expressed concerns about the legal implications of asset seizure.EU nations  holding the majority of frozen Russian funds  fear that expropriation could lead to investment outflows and destabilize the euro.We are building the infrastructure of human freedom and empowering people to be informed  healthy and aware.

Every purchase at HealthRangerStore.com helps fund our efforts to build and share more tools for empowering humanity with knowledge and abundance.Nabiullina previously cautioned that seizing profits from frozen Russian funds  as well as the assets themselves  would diminish the appeal of the euro and the dollar as reserve currencies in international markets.Moscow has condemned the seizure of its assets as ""theft "" with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov warning of immediate retaliation if the bill authorizing confiscation is enacted. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov suggested that Moscow could downgrade diplomatic relations with Washington in response to asset seizure.The pivotal question revolves around whether G7 states will transition from merely freezing these assets to seizing them  effectively liquidating the funds to aid Ukraine. This issue has gained urgency amid waning support  particularly in the U.S. and Europe  for continued financial assistance to Ukraine's defense efforts.In the U.S.  bipartisan support for the REPO Act empowers the president to confiscate Russian sovereign assets  directing them into a ""Ukraine Support Fund"" for reconstruction and aid.However  the legality and economic ramifications of such actions remain contentious. Legally  the norm of sovereign immunity presents a significant obstacle to asset seizure  as it is a well-established principle in international law. Despite arguments for ""countermeasures "" doctrinal support for asset confiscation remains scant.Seizing Russian assets could benefit ChinaEconomically  the repercussions of asset seizure could alienate allies and weaken the euro's reserve currency status. Moreover  any negative fallout would primarily affect European nations  as most of the frozen funds are held in accounts at Euroclear.The EU has hesitated to endorse outright confiscation  opting instead to redirect interest payments from the frozen assets to Kyiv. Nonetheless  the G7 continues to discuss the proposal for seizure  with the Biden administration  Canada and Japan advocating for its implementation.As debates intensify  concerns about undermining international law protections and exacerbating discontent in the Global South persist.The potential backlash against Western financial warfare could inadvertently benefit China  enhancing its diplomatic credibility and yuan internationalization efforts.While China's vision of a ""de-dollarized"" world could gain momentum from Western confiscation efforts  significant hurdles remain. The yuan's current limitations  including strict capital controls and managed exchange rates  hinder its widespread adoption as a reserve currency.A managed process of de-dollarization with broad participation could be beneficial  but a chaotic transition driven by Western actions risks exacerbating tensions and undermining international norms. It is imperative to tread cautiously and consider the broader implications before proceeding with asset seizure.Watch this daily update from political commentator Alex Christoforou discussing Treasury Secretary Jannet Yellen's push for the EU to steal Russian assets.This video is from the channel Oldyoti's Home Page on Brighteon.com.More related stories:If U.S. tries to steal Russian assets for Ukraine  the American economy and western financial system will CRUMBLE.EU will lose more than Russia if it confiscates assets – Moscow.Yellen wants frozen Russian assets to be given to Ukraine – a move that could drive away nations from Western banks.Sources include:RT.comResponsibleStatecraft.orgBrighteon.com",neutral,0.03,0.7,0.27,negative,0.03,0.24,0.73,True,English,"['Russian central bank governor', 'Western seizure', 'frozen assets', 'financial stability', 'NaturalNews', 'com', 'uncensorable Brighteon.io free speech platform', 'Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov', 'free, downloadable generative AI tools', 'Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov', 'Treasury Secretary Jannet Yellen', 'Russian central bank governor', 'financial stability Central Bank', 'special military operation', 'foreign exchange reserves', 'strict capital controls', 'Western financial warfare', 'White House advocates', 'reserve currency status', 'international law protections', 'Gov.

Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management’s current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking statements include  among other things  statements concerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements expressing management’s expectations  beliefs  estimates  forecasts  projections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as “aim”; “ambition”; ‘‘anticipate’’; ‘‘believe’’; “commit”; “commitment”; ‘‘could’’; ‘‘estimate’’; ‘‘expect’’; ‘‘goals’’; ‘‘intend’’; ‘‘may’’; “milestones”; ‘‘objectives’’; ‘‘outlook’’; ‘‘plan’’; ‘‘probably’’; ‘‘project’’; ‘‘risks’’; “schedule”; ‘‘seek’’; ‘‘should’’; ‘‘target’’; ‘‘will’’; “would” and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this announcement  including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell’s products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets  and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative  judicial  fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks  including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities  delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics  such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak  regional conflicts  such as the Russia-Ukraine war  and a significant cybersecurity breach; and (n) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this announcement are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc’s Form 20-F for the year ended December 31  2023 (available at www.shell.com/investors/news-and-filings/sec-filings.html and www.sec.gov). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this announcement and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement  May 2  2024. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information  future events or other information. In light of these risks  results could differ materially from those stated  implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this announcement.Shell’s Net Carbon IntensityAlso  in this announcement we may refer to Shell’s “Net Carbon Intensity” (NCI)  which includes Shell’s carbon emissions from the production of our energy products  our suppliers’ carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers’ carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell’s NCI also includes the emissions associated with the production and use of energy products produced by others which Shell purchases for resale. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the terms Shell’s “Net Carbon Intensity” or NCI are for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries.Shell’s net-zero emissions targetShell’s operating plan  outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly  they reflect our Scope 1  Scope 2 and NCI targets over the next ten years. However  Shell’s operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target  as this target is currently outside our planning period. In the future  as society moves towards net-zero emissions  we expect Shell’s operating plans to reflect this movement. However  if society is not net zero in 2050  as of today  there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.Forward-Looking non-GAAP measuresThis announcement may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as cash capital expenditure and divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell  such as oil and gas prices  interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover  estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc’s consolidated financial statements.The contents of websites referred to in this announcement do not form part of this announcement.We may have used certain terms  such as resources  in this announcement that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC.

40285,Euroclear,Bing API,https://www.yahoo.com/news/g-7-eyes-plan-us-174850067.html,G-7 Eyes Plan on US-Led $50 Billion Aid Package for Ukraine,The US is in talks with close partners to lead a group of allies that would give as much as $50 billion in aid to Ukraine  with the massive outlay being repaid with the windfall profits from sovereign Russian assets that have been frozen – and are accruing interest — mostly in Europe.,(Bloomberg) -- The US is in talks with close partners to lead a group of allies that would give as much as $50 billion in aid to Ukraine  with the massive outlay being repaid with the windfall profits from sovereign Russian assets that have been frozen – and are accruing interest — mostly in Europe.Most Read from BloombergThe plan is being discussed among the Group of Seven nations  with the US pushing to have an agreement when G-7 leaders meet in Italy in June  according to people familiar with the proposal. Discussions on this topic have been difficult and an agreement could still take months  they said.The plan signals a strong show of support from Washington after Congress approved $61 billion in assistance for Kyiv in April that had been held up for months due to partisan wrangling. The move will also put renewed pressure on the European Union to drop its objections to utilizing the immobilized Russian assets.Spokespeople for the US Treasury Department and White House National Security Council declined to comment.When asked about this type of proposal in which the US  or a subset of G-7 countries  put up the aid money  which the EU would repay using the frozen assets  US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said that “it’s something we’re discussing.”“Ideally  this is something we would like the entire G-7 to participate in  be part of  not just have the United States doing it alone ” she told Bloomberg in an interview in Sedona  Arizona  Friday.The delay in financial and military aid has prompted increasingly urgent warnings from officials in Kyiv of the risk of a Russian breakthrough in the war as Ukrainian forces struggled with dwindling supplies of munitions.The latest development follows months of discussion among allies over how to take on board European fears about EU exposure to risks of using the frozen Russian assets  while also putting aid for Ukraine on a more sustainable footing.Most European nations have pushed back against outright confiscation of the assets and have been skeptical of proposals they fear would undermine the euro’s stability or expose them to Russian retaliation. The US push essentially boils down to finding a way to provide Ukraine with the largest possible support quickly rather than in smaller amounts  by better mobilizing the profits produced by the frozen assets  said the people.With President Joe Biden facing a challenge from his Republican predecessor Donald Trump in November’s election  a key element of the US push is also to shield allied assistance to Ukraine from political shifts on both sides of the Atlantic. Trump has expressed skepticism about aid to Ukraine and political divisions in the US may make it hard to approve further support for Kyiv.The G-7 countries have immobilized about $280 billion of Russian central bank assets in response to President Vladimir Putin’s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine  with the majority held in Europe through the Belgium-based clearing house Euroclear.Windfall ProfitsSome €159 billion of frozen Russian assets have generated net profit of €557 million ($601 million) from Feb. 15  according to Euroclear’s first quarter financial results. Since last year  the assets have generated about €3.9 billion in net profit.Russian sovereign assets held by the company could grow to as much as €190 billion by 2028 as they mature into cash  one of the people said.The assets are expected to generate about €5 billion in windfall profits annually and a central element of the US proposal is to bring forward those proceeds to increase the amount of support Ukraine receives in the near term.The size of the aid that would be immediately provided to Kyiv would depend on the length of their repayment terms and how long the assets were immobilized to fund the bonds  according to the people.Another option  previously reported by Bloomberg  would see allies issue some $50 billion worth of bonds through a special purpose vehicle backed by the windfall profits. The updated plans would look to raise similar amounts.Russian AdvanceThe debate is taking place with Russia’s military seeking to advance along the front line against outgunned Ukrainian forces. Kyiv’s US and European allies have struggled to supply it with munitions  and Ukrainian efforts to boost troop numbers have been slow.One unresolved issue is who would provide guarantees that the funds would be repaid if the Russian assets become unfrozen. That risk is regarded as low  given that G-7 nations have pledged to continue blocking the funds until Russia agrees to pay toward Ukraine’s postwar reconstruction  one of the people said.The latest US proposal seeks to address earlier worries among some allies that using the assets themselves could amount effectively to seizing them. It also avoids placing a disproportionate burden on the EU.Still  reaching agreement remains fraught with difficulties  said the people.The deal  if agreed  would replace one drawn up by the EU to transfer windfall profits from Euroclear generated by the frozen assets from Feb. 15 to support Ukraine twice a year. Agreement on that EU-only plan is expected as early as this month  some of the people said.Under the EU’s plan  Euroclear would hold on to profits made before that date and retain some of the later proceeds to cover costs and risks such as potential retaliatory asset seizures in Russia. The proceeds are also subject to tax  a detail that has annoyed several EU states.--With assistance from Jorge Valero and Christopher Condon.Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek©2024 Bloomberg L.P.,neutral,0.12,0.87,0.01,negative,0.03,0.25,0.72,True,English,"['G-7 Eyes Plan', '$50 Billion Aid Package', 'US-Led', 'Ukraine', 'White House National Security Council', 'US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen', 'Republican predecessor Donald Trump', 'first quarter financial results', 'Russian central bank assets', 'Belgium-based clearing house', 'US Treasury Department', 'President Joe Biden', 'President Vladimir Putin', 'special purpose vehicle', 'One unresolved issue', 'Most European nations', 'largest possible support', 'sovereign Russian assets', 'Russian sovereign assets', 'The G-7 countries', 'frozen Russian assets', 'latest US proposal', 'central element', 'The US', 'G-7 nations', 'Russian breakthrough', 'latest development', 'Russian retaliation', 'Russian Advance', 'Seven nations', 'frozen assets', 'European Union', 'European fears', 'G-7 leaders', 'entire G-7', 'US push', 'close partners', 'massive outlay', 'strong show', 'partisan wrangling', 'United States', 'urgent warnings', 'Ukrainian forces', 'dwindling supplies', 'sustainable footing', 'outright confiscation', 'smaller amounts', 'key element', 'political shifts', 'political divisions', 'February 2022 invasion', 'net profit', 'last year', 'near term', 'repayment terms', 'similar amounts', 'front line', 'Ukrainian efforts', 'troop numbers', 'postwar reconstruction', 'earlier worries', 'disproportionate burden', 'windfall profits', 'allied assistance', '$50 billion worth', 'European allies', 'aid money', 'EU exposure', 'military aid', '5 billion', 'Bloomberg', 'talks', 'group', 'Ukraine', 'interest', 'plan', 'agreement', 'Italy', 'June', 'people', 'Discussions', 'topic', 'months', 'Washington', 'Congress', 'Kyiv', 'April', 'move', 'pressure', 'objections', 'type', 'subset', 'something', 'interview', 'Sedona', 'Arizona', 'delay', 'officials', 'risk', 'munitions', 'board', 'proposals', 'stability', 'way', 'challenge', 'November', 'election', 'sides', 'Atlantic', 'skepticism', 'response', 'majority', 'Euroclear', 'Feb.', 'company', 'cash', 'proceeds', 'size', 'length', 'bonds', 'option', 'debate', 'place', 'guarantees', 'funds', 'difficulties', 'deal']",2024-05-03,2024-05-03,yahoo.com

Russian officials have said the amount is comparable to the $300 billion of Russian reserves frozen.“Payouts on blocked assets in type-C accounts could start to be seized in favour of the state ” said Vladimir Yazev  investment portfolio manager at investment firm Aigenis.“Additionally  the government may consider measures on blocking non-exchange assets still held by unfriendly countries.” These assets include taxes  grants and private donations.A Russian lawyer familiar with C accounts  who asked not to be named  said that if non-residents decline to take part in an asset swap scheme run by a state-appointed Russian broker  the only remaining option would be confiscation or foreclosure.Under the scheme  Westerners would get Russians’ blocked holdings of foreign securities and Russians get Westerners’ blocked holdings of Russian ones. Retail investors wishing to participate have until May 8 to submit offers.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said at the weekend that there was still a lot of Western money in Russia that could be targeted by Moscow’s counter-measures. He said the government would also pursue legal challenges against the confiscation of assets.“Russia…will tirelessly defend its interests ” he said.CORPORATE SEIZUREOn Saturday  Medvedev proposed the confiscation of private individuals’ Russian assets as one response to any U.S. seizure of its reserves  adding such a move was justified by the “hybrid war” being waged against Moscow.The former president  who espouses hardline views towards the West  is a close ally of President Vladimir Putin and maintains influence as deputy chairman of the Security Council of Russia.However  since Western nations imposed sweeping sanctions in response to the invasion of Ukraine  foreign holdings in Russia have dropped by around 40% to $696 billion  central bank data shows  reducing some of the potency of such a threat.In addition to stakes in companies and physical assets  Russia could target foreign investment held in securities  according to one of the economists  who asked not to be named because of the sensitivity of the subject.But experts said the latest published figures from Russia’s central bank on foreign direct investment showed that a sizeable proportion of foreign money was likely coming from Russian companies registered abroad.Russia stopped releasing a country-by-country breakdown after the invasion  but the last such data published for Jan. 1  2022 showed that Cyprus  where many Russian firms are incorporated  accounted for almost 30% of all Russia’s FDI.Many Russian companies are also incorporated in the Netherlands.“A chunk of total FDI in Russia is really Russian money already ” said Gian Maria Milesi-Ferretti  senior fellow in economic studies at The Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at the Brookings Institution  a U.S. think-tank.Russia’s state-run RIA news agency reported in January that Western firms’ assets worth $288 billion were ripe for seizure in Russia  citing January 2022 data.Reuters could not determine where RIA took its figures from  but central bank figures showed $289 billion in derivative and other foreign investments at that time.That figure had fallen to $215 billion by end-2023. RIA also said Cyprus and the Netherlands  respectively  accounted for $98.3 billion and $50.1 billion of those assets  implying a high degree of Russian company ownership.The central bank and finance ministry did not respond to a request for comment on the figures.‘ASSETS FOR A SONG’Moscow has already forced foreign companies selling assets in Russia to do so at discounts of at least 50%. It has placed other Western assets under temporary management and installed Kremlin-friendly executives.Western companies have acknowledged losses totalling $107 billion  a significant sum that goes beyond the value of physical assets.“Russia has already snatched up affiliates of Western firms  often for a song ” said Milesi-Ferretti. But the value of seized assets is not just in buildings and machinery  it is also in the technology  know-how and connections attached  he added.Energy group Shell  fast food giant McDonald’s and carmakers Volkswagen and Renault have sold their Russian businesses. Others including Austrian bank Raiffeisen  food group Nestle and U.S. food and beverage giant PepsiCo continue to do business.Another area of leverage Moscow has is in Europe  where the Brussels-based depository Euroclear holds the majority of Russia’s reserves.Some politicians in the bloc are nervous that the euro could be adversely affected if other countries such as China – a Russian ally – start repatriating reserves as a precaution against them being swooped on down the line.There is also the risk that Russia could  through court action  try to seize Euroclear cash in securities depositories in Hong Kong  Dubai and elsewhere. The worry is that this could drain Euroclear capital and require a huge bailout.A Euroclear spokesperson declined to comment on what Russia might do.“Euroclear of course takes into account all possible risk scenarios and strengthens its capital by retaining Russian sanction-related profits as a buffer against current and future risks ” the spokesperson added.While its ties with the West have frayed  Russia has used a current account surplus of almost $300 billion in 2022-23 to build up overseas assets – likely in so-called friendly jurisdictions that do not openly oppose the war in Ukraine  according to Milesi-Ferretti.Russia’s efforts to reduce its integration into Western financial systems since its illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014 have cut dependence on foreign money  but also limited possible retaliation in any frozen asset fight  he added.“If the aim is to retaliate  having a smaller amount of assets to seize makes your threat less salient.”Read more:(Reporting by Alexander Marrow; additional reporting by Reuters in Moscow and Jan Strupczewski in Brussels; Editing by Mike Collett-White and Daniel Flynn)Visited 44 times  44 visit(s) today,negative,0.05,0.37,0.58,negative,0.03,0.3,0.67,True,English,"['asset seizure', 'Russia', 'West', 'retaliation', 'enough U.S. state property', 'Former President Dmitry Medvedev', 'private individuals’ Russian assets', 'foreign investors’ financial assets', 'U.S. seizure', 'private investors’ cash', 'early morning brew', 'The United States', '15-20 billion euros', 'National Settlement Depository', 'latest published figures', 'President Vladimir Putin', 'state-appointed Russian broker', 'many Russian firms', 'investment portfolio manager', 'Western financial systems', 'dwindling foreign investment', 'asset swap scheme', 'foreign direct investment', 'foreign investors’ assets', 'special “type-C” accounts', 'central bank data', 'Dmitry Peskov', 'private donations', 'financial manoeuvres', 'Retail investors', 'Russian lawyer', 'Russian ones', 'type-C accounts', 'Vladimir Yazev', 'investment firm', 'CORPORATE SEIZURE', 'Russian reserves', 'Western leaders', 'Western nations', 'foreign money', 'frozen assets', 'Euroclear assets', 'non-exchange assets', 'physical assets', 'Russian officials', 'Russian companies', 'legal challenges', 'foreign holdings', 'retaliatory options', 'BizNews Insider', 'Alexander Marrow', 'EU leaders', 'ringfencing profits', 'catastrophic consequences', 'unfriendly countries', 'remaining option', 'Kremlin spokesman', 'hardline views', 'close ally', 'deputy chairman', 'Security Council', 'sweeping sanctions', 'sizeable proportion', 'Western money', 'foreign securities', 'retaliation options', 'hybrid war', 'country breakdown', 'six economists', 'full-scale invasion', 'one response', 'experts', 'efficacy', 'measures', 'leveraging', 'complexity', 'situation', 'integration', 'speed', 'content', 'newsletter', 'inbox', '5:30am', 'Register', 'SOURCE', 'REUTERS', 'LONDON', 'ability', 'ways', 'Ukraine', 'attempt', 'capital', 'interest', 'Saturday', 'step', 'lawyers', 'status', 'sides', 'February', 'consensus', 'access', 'Moscow', 'waiver', 'entity', 'amount', 'Payouts', 'favour', 'Aigenis', 'government', 'taxes', 'grants', 'non-residents', 'part', 'confiscation', 'foreclosure', 'Westerners', 'Russians', 'May', 'offers', 'weekend', 'lot', 'move', 'influence', 'potency', 'threat', 'addition', 'stakes', 'sensitivity', 'subject', 'Jan.', 'Cyprus', 'FDI']",2024-05-03,2024-05-03,biznews.com

Despite this  the strategic realignment and the ten years of investment in research and development are now beneficial for all geographies of the group.Today  2CRSi is demonstrating its ability to gain market share in several areas driven by strong demand on an international scale: dedicated servers for Artificial Intelligence  liquid cooling solutions with or without heat reuse  EDGE and EMBEDDED products  as well as high-value-added services.2CRSi thanks its customers  partners  and shareholders for their continued trust  and commits to maintaining its focus on innovation and operational excellence.About2CRSiFounded in Strasbourg  France  the 2CRSi Group designs  produces and markets high-performance  customized  eco-responsible servers. In fiscal year 2022-2023  the Group generated sales of 184 million euros.

The gradual recovery of our activity in China  which remained well below pre-covid levels  is continuing with a high single-digit organic revenue growth rate this quarter.As far as Q2 is concerned  we expect organic revenue growth around +12.0% driven by continued strong digital revenue growth across all business segments and including the positive impact of the Paris Olympics and the UEFA Euro 2024 in Germany.We are confident that Out of Home (OOH) will continue to grow its market share in a fragmented media landscape with Digital Out of Home (DOOH) being the fastest growing media segment. JCDecaux as the industry leader and the most digitised global OOH Media company is well positioned to benefit from this digital transformation.”Following the adoption of IFRS 11 from January 1st  2014  the operating data presented below is adjusted to include our prorata share in companies under joint control.Please refer to the paragraph “Adjusted data” of this release for the definition of adjusted data and reconciliation with IFRS.The values shown in the tables are generally expressed in millions of euros. The sum of the rounded amounts or variations calculations may differ  albeit to an insignificant extent  from the reported values.Adjusted revenue for the first quarter 2024 increased by +11.1% to €801.6 million compared to €721.3 million in the first quarter of 2023.Excluding the negative impact from foreign exchange variations and the positive impact of changes in perimeter  adjusted revenue increased by +11.0%.Adjusted advertising revenue  excluding revenue related to sale  rental and maintenance of street furniture and advertising displays  increased by +12.0% on an organic basis in the first quarter of 2024.By activity:Q1 adjusted revenue 2024 (€m) 2023 (€m) Reported growth Organic growth(a) Street Furniture 400.8 364.3 +10.0% +9.2% Transport 288.2 254.0 +13.5% +15.1% Billboard 112.6 103.0 +9.4% +7.0% Total 801.6 721.3 +11.1% +11.0%a.

UK  Asia-Pacific and Rest of the World all grew double-digit. France recorded mid-single-digit growth  while the rest of Europe saw high-single-digit growth.First quarter adjusted advertising revenue  excluding revenue related to sale  rental and maintenance of street furniture was up +9.8% on an organic basis.TRANSPORTFirst quarter adjusted revenue increased by +13.5% to €288.2 million (+15.1% on an organic basis)  reflecting the solid recovery of our activity in both airports and public transport systems in all geographies except in China. Most geographies grew double-digit. Transport remained meaningfully impacted by the lower level of activity in China compared to pre-covid.BILLBOARDFirst quarter adjusted revenue increased by +9.4% to €112.6 million (+7.0% on an organic basis) driven by the most digitised markets  while France decreased due to the ongoing rationalisation of our inventory in line with regulations. UK and Rest of the World were the drivers of growth with a double-digit increase.ADJUSTED DATAUnder IFRS 11  applicable from January 1st  2014  companies under joint control are accounted for using the equity method.However  in order to reflect the business reality of the Group  operating data of the companies under joint control will continue to be proportionately integrated in the operating management reports used by directors to monitor the activity  allocate resources and measure performance.Consequently  pursuant to IFRS 8  Segment Reporting presented in the financial statements complies with the Group’s internal information  and the Group’s external financial communication therefore relies on this operating financial information. Financial information and comments are therefore based on “adjusted” data  consistent with historical data prior to 2014  which is reconciled with IFRS financial statements.In Q1 2024  the impact of IFRS 11 on adjusted revenue was -€61.2 million (-€49.5 million in Q1 2023)  leaving IFRS revenue at €740.4 million (€671.8 million in Q1 2023).ORGANIC GROWTH DEFINITIONThe Group’s organic growth corresponds to the adjusted revenue growth excluding foreign exchange impact and perimeter effect. The reference fiscal year remains unchanged regarding the reported figures  and the organic growth is calculated by converting the revenue of the current fiscal year at the average exchange rates of the previous year and taking into account the perimeter variations prorata temporis  but including revenue variations from the gains of new contracts and the losses of contracts previously held in our portfolio.€m Q1 2023 adjusted revenue (a) 721.3 2024 IFRS revenue (b) 740.4 IFRS 11 impacts (c) 61.2 2024 adjusted revenue (d) = (b) + (c) 801.6 Currency impacts (e) 7.1 2024 adjusted revenue at 2023 exchange rates (f) = (d) + (e) 808.7 Change in scope (g) -8.4 2024 adjusted organic revenue (h) = (f) + (g) 800.3 Organic growth (i) = (h) / (a) – 1 +11.0%€m Impact of currency as of March 31st  2024 RMB 3.1 AUD 3.0 GBP -2.6 BRL -0.9 Other 4.5 Total 7.1Average exchange rate Q1 2024 Q1 2023 RMB 0.1281 0.1305 AUD 0.6057 0.6140 GBP 1.1676 1.1497 BRL 0.1860 0.1851Next information:Annual General Meeting of Shareholders: May 7th  20242024 half year results: July 25th  2024 (before market)Key Figures for JCDecaux2023 revenue: €3 570.0m(a)N°1 Out-of-Home Media company worldwideA daily audience of 850 million people in more than 80 countries1 056 833 advertising panels worldwidePresent in 3 918 cities with more than 10 000 inhabitants11 650 employeesJCDecaux is listed on the Eurolist of Euronext Paris and is part of the Euronext 100 and Euronext Family Business indexesJCDecaux is recognised for its extra-financial performance in the FTSE4Good (3.4/5)  CDP (A)  MSCI (AAA)  Sustainalytics (13.7)  and has achieved Gold Medal status from EcoVadis1st Out-of-Home Media company to join the RE100Leader in self-service bike rental scheme: pioneer in eco-friendly mobilityN°1 worldwide in street furniture (630 196 advertising panels)N°1 worldwide in transport advertising with 153 airports and 258 contracts in metros  buses  trains and tramways (319 081 advertising panels)N°1 in Europe for billboards (85 743 advertising panels worldwide)N°1 in outdoor advertising in Europe (708 620 advertising panels)N°1 in outdoor advertising in Asia-Pacific (165 292 advertising panels)N°1 in outdoor advertising in Latin America (91 682 advertising panels)N°1 in outdoor advertising in Africa (25 337 advertising panels)N°1 in outdoor advertising in the Middle East (21 300 advertising panels)(a) Adjusted revenueFor more information about JCDecaux  please visit jcdecaux.com .Join us on Twitter   LinkedIn   Facebook   Instagram and YouTube.Forward looking statementsThis news release may contain some forward-looking statements.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen's future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ˜believes'  ˜anticipates' and ˜expects' and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen's expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions.

Dematerialised shares do not benefit from the double voting right. The method used by VGP to calculate the holding period of two consecutive years is the LIFO (""last in  first out"") method  i.e.: for the same registered shareholder  the shares that the latter has most recently acquired are the first shares that will be deducted from his total amount of registered shares if he/she transfers shares to a third party. Any share converted into a dematerialised share or the ownership of which is transferred loses the double voting right as from its dematerialisation or entry of its transfer in VGP’s share register. It is therefore important that VGP be kept informed of any transfer of registered shares by the transferor and/or the transferee promptly at the time of each transfer in order to enable VGP to keep its register of registered shares and  consequently  the number of registered shares with double voting rights up to date.ABOUT VGPVGP is a pan-European owner  manager and developer of high-quality logistics and semi-industrial real estate.

The solution integrates seamlessly with ELM Solutions’ TyMetrix 360° and Passport platforms to not only capture early law firm engagement information and competitive pricing insights  but also provide enforcement of pricing agreements for full vendor transparency and cost management.“With the launch of LegalCollaborator  Wolters Kluwer continues to lead the way for innovation in comprehensive software solutions empowering corporate legal departments and their law firm partners ” said Raja Sengupta  Executive Vice President and General Manager of Wolters Kluwer ELM Solutions. “Our market-leading combination of deep domain knowledge  insights mined from industry’s deepest and broadest datasets and comprehensive enterprise legal management software help legal professionals to maximize value in every phase of their engagements.”For the first time  legal professionals will have access to an efficient  scalable and transparent process for initiating single law firm engagements and competitive bids. LegalCollaborator removes subjectivity from law firm selection  providing a series of pre-defined templates that allow users to efficiently collect and view critical matter details such as conflict waivers  strategy  staffing and pricing structure side-by-side. A user-friendly interface will provide corporate legal teams with more transparency into their matters  driving an unparalleled ability to accomplish the desired outcome at the best possible cost. Meanwhile their law firm partners can use the solution to demonstrate the unique strategies and crucial differentiators paramount to successful matter outcomes. This generates a more competitive bidding environment that brings only the best firms to the top.By integrating LegalCollaborator with TyMetrix 360° and Passport  Wolters Kluwer is helping organizations streamline the disconnected matter planning and competitive bid management systems that have traditionally made it difficult to successfully track spend throughout the life of a matter. For example  users can leverage AI-powered spend management tools such as ELM Solution’s LegalVIEW BillAnalyzer  as well as the $180+ billion in historical performance data found in the LegalVIEW database  to both set as well as enforce strong billing guidelines to tightly control spend.For more information about Wolters Kluwer’s please visit: www.wolterskluwer.com.About Wolters KluwerWolters Kluwer (EURONEXT: WKL) is a global leader in information  software solutions and services for professionals in healthcare; tax and accounting; financial and corporate compliance; legal and regulatory; corporate performance and ESG.

KG (Hündgen)  a waste management expert in logistics  sorting services and the recycling of recyclable materials from waste mixtures  announce the signing of a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding relating to the sourcing  preparation and recycling of 15kt/year of post-consumer PET waste using CARBIOS’ biorecycling technology at its first commercial plant in Longlaville  from end 2026.The partnership will leverage Hündgen’s expertise and network in the sourcing and preparation of light packaging waste collected from German households. This PET waste will be prepared into flakes ready for biorecycling using CARBIOS’ enzymatic depolymerization technology  which produces food-grade PTA and MEG  further re-polymerized into PET.The supply partnership with Hündgen contributes to securing the majority of CARBIOS’ feedstock needs for its first commercial plant in Longlaville  France. This plant will have a 50kt/year capacity when it will be fully operational and is currently under construction. This latest sourcing announcement comes in addition to previously announced agreements  such as with Landbell Group for food trays from Germany  and the winning CITEO tender for trays in France. The location of the Longlaville plant is strategically close to nearby waste supplies in Belgium  Germany and Luxembourg.Through its enzymatic depolymerization process  CARBIOS can process all types of PET waste  including waste that cannot be recycled with current technologies. Multilayered  colored  and opaque packaging waste as well as polyester textile waste now have circular recycling solutions.Emmanuel Ladent  CEO of CARBIOS: “Through our partnership with Hündgen  CARBIOS has now secured most of the feedstock supply for our first commercial plant. CARBIOS’ innovative biorecycling technology enables the conversion of diverse PET waste allowing more flexibility in sourcing  and price-competitiveness compared with high-demand clear bottles. Our local sourcing strategy has also paid off and demonstrates the importance of locating biorecycling plants near waste supplies  an expertise that we’re keen to share with our future license holders.”Christian Hündgen  CEO of Hündgen Entsorgungs GmbH & Co.KG: “Establishing new standards in the field of plastic packaging recycling requires the development and implementation of innovative technologies and the promotion of cross-border cooperation. In this context  we are delighted to be part of one of the leading projects in Europe in the field of PET non-bottle recycling.”###About CARBIOS:CARBIOS is a biotech company developing and industrializing biological solutions to reinvent the life cycle of plastic and textiles.

In that judgment  the Antwerp Court of Appeals had confirmed the revocation of the appointment of a panel of experts on the basis of Article 7:160 BCCA and the halting of the expert investigation.The Supreme Court dealt with the petition at a hearing on 2 May 2024. Today  the Company was informed that the Supreme Court has rejected the appeal.The written judgment of the Supreme Court itself (with its reasoning) has not yet been received by the Company; it expects to receive it shortly.BackgroundAt the request of a group of shareholders of the Company  the President of the Antwerp Enterprise Court (Antwerp division)  in an order dated 30 October 2020  appointed a panel of experts to examine  among other things  certain transactions between the former Nyrstar group and the Trafigura group. On 15 December 2020  the Company filed an appeal against that order.On 4 February 2021  Trafigura PTE Ltd. and Trafigura Group PTE Ltd. filed a third-party application against the same order. In an order dated 9 November 2021  the President of the Antwerp Enterprise Court (Antwerp division) declared the third-party application well-founded and revoked the previous judgment of 30 October 2020 vis-à-vis Trafigura PTE Ltd.  Trafigura Group PTE Ltd.  Nyrstar NV and the group of shareholders who had requested the measure. The appointment of the experts was revoked and the expert investigation was halted. On 23 December 2021  the original plaintiff shareholders and the shareholders who had meanwhile intervened  filed an appeal against  among others  that order.On 17 November 2022  the Antwerp Court of Appeals issued a judgment in these appeals. The Court of Appeals declared that there were no indications that the interests of the Company would be seriously threatened  and hence that an expert investigation was not justified.On 28 March 2023  the claimant shareholders served a Supreme Court petition on Nyrstar against the aforementioned judgment of 17 November 2022  seeking to have that judgment set aside. That request has thus now been rejected by the Supreme Court. This dismissal of said request means  in principle (and subject to the exact text and reasoning of the judgment  which  as noted above  the Company has not yet received)  that these summary proceedings aimed at obtaining a company law expert investigation have come to a final end.Nyrstar NV will currently not submit the dissolution or the continuation of the Company to the general meetingThe Company also revisits its press release of 14 February 2023 (see link ). In that press release  it had announced that it would not take steps to convene a general meeting with the dissolution as an agenda item (or take preparatory actions to that effect) until the Supreme Court had rendered a judgment  and that it would inform the market by then.The Company informs that  for the time being  it will not yet submit the dissolution or the continuation of the Company to the general meeting. It will revert to this matter no sooner than after a decision will have been given by the Antwerp Enterprise Court (Turnhout division) on the petition for interim measures filed on 11 March 2024. These proceedings were initiated on 25 April 2024. The pleadings are scheduled for 28 November 2024 (and 5 December 2024 as a backup day).A detailed overview of the current proceedings is available on the Company website at: https://www.nyrstarnv.be/en/investors/restructuring/summary-of-ongoing-proceedings.About NyrstarThe Company is incorporated in Belgium and listed on Euronext Brussels under the symbol NYR.

The p…,Shell plcShell announces commencement of a share buyback programmeMay 2  2024Shell plc (the ‘Company’) today announces the commencement of a $3.5 billion share buyback programme covering an aggregate contract term of approximately three months (the ‘programme’). The purpose of the programme is to reduce the issued share capital of the Company. All shares repurchased as part of the programme will be cancelled. It is intended that  subject to market conditions  the programme will be completed prior to the Company’s Q2 2024 results announcement  scheduled for August 1  2024.The Company has entered into an arrangement with a single broker consisting of three irrevocable  non-discretionary contracts  to enable the purchase of ordinary shares on both London market exchanges (the London Stock Exchange and/or on BATS and/or on Chi-X) (pursuant to two ‘London contracts’) and Netherlands exchanges (Euronext Amsterdam and/or on CBOE Europe DXE and/or on Turquoise Europe) (pursuant to one ‘Netherlands contract’) for a period up to and including July 26  2024. The aggregate maximum consideration for the purchase of ordinary shares under the London contracts is $2 billion and the maximum consideration for the purchase of ordinary shares under the Netherlands contract is $1.5 billion. Purchases under the London contracts will be carried out in accordance with the Company’s authority1 to repurchase shares on-market and will be effected within certain contractually agreed parameters. Purchases under the Netherlands contract will be carried out in accordance with the Company’s authority1 to repurchase shares off-market pursuant to the off-market share buyback contract approved by its shareholders and the parameters set out therein.The maximum number of ordinary shares which may be purchased or committed to be purchased by the Company under the programme (across all three contracts) is 360 000 000  which is the maximum number remaining as of the date of this announcement pursuant to the relevant authorities granted by shareholders at the Company's 2023 Annual General Meeting1.The broker will make its trading decisions in relation to the Company's securities independently of the Company.The programme will be conducted in accordance with Chapter 12 of the Listing Rules  Article 5 of the Market Abuse Regulation 596/2014/EU dealing with buy-back programmes (‘EU MAR’) and EU MAR as “onshored” into UK law from the end of the Brexit transition period (at 11:00 pm on 31 December 2020) through the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (as amended by the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020)  and as amended  supplemented  restated  novated  substituted or replaced including by relevant statutory instruments (including  The Market Abuse (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations (SI 2019/310))  from time to time and the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2016/1052 (the ‘EU MAR Delegated Regulation’) and the EU MAR Delegated Regulation as “onshored” into UK law from the end of the Brexit transition period (at 11:00 pm on 31 December 2020) through the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (as amended by the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020)  and as amended  supplemented  restated  novated  substituted or replaced  including by relevant statutory instruments (including  The Market Abuse (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations (SI 2019/310))  from time to time.1 The existing shareholder authorities to buy back shares granted at the Company's 2023 Annual General Meeting will expire at the earlier of the close of business on August 22  2024  and the end of the date of the Company's 2024 Annual General Meeting.

In this announcement “Shell”  “Shell Group” and “Group” are sometimes used for convenience where references are made to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general. Likewise  the words “we”  “us” and “our” are also used to refer to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general or to those who work for them. These terms are also used where no useful purpose is served by identifying the particular entity or entities. ‘‘Subsidiaries’’  “Shell subsidiaries” and “Shell companies” as used in this announcement refer to entities over which Shell plc either directly or indirectly has control. The term “joint venture”  “joint operations”  “joint arrangements”  and “associates” may also be used to refer to a commercial arrangement in which Shell has a direct or indirect ownership interest with one or more parties. The term “Shell interest” is used for convenience to indicate the direct and/or indirect ownership interest held by Shell in an entity or unincorporated joint arrangement  after exclusion of all third-party interest.Forward-Looking StatementsThis announcement contains forward-looking statements (within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) concerning the financial condition  results of operations and businesses of Shell. All statements other than statements of historical fact are  or may be deemed to be  forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management’s current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking statements include  among other things  statements concerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements expressing management’s expectations  beliefs  estimates  forecasts  projections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as “aim”; “ambition”; ‘‘anticipate’’; ‘‘believe’’; “commit”; “commitment”; ‘‘could’’; ‘‘estimate’’; ‘‘expect’’; ‘‘goals’’; ‘‘intend’’; ‘‘may’’; “milestones”; ‘‘objectives’’; ‘‘outlook’’; ‘‘plan’’; ‘‘probably’’; ‘‘project’’; ‘‘risks’’; “schedule”; ‘‘seek’’; ‘‘should’’; ‘‘target’’; ‘‘will’’; “would” and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this announcement  including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell’s products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets  and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative  judicial  fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks  including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities  delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics  such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak  regional conflicts  such as the Russia-Ukraine war  and a significant cybersecurity breach; and (n) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this announcement are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc’s Form 20-F for the year ended December 31  2023 (available at www.shell.com/investors/news-and-filings/sec-filings.html and www.sec.gov). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this announcement and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement  May 2  2024. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information  future events or other information. In light of these risks  results could differ materially from those stated  implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this announcement.Shell’s Net Carbon IntensityAlso  in this announcement we may refer to Shell’s “Net Carbon Intensity” (NCI)  which includes Shell’s carbon emissions from the production of our energy products  our suppliers’ carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers’ carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell’s NCI also includes the emissions associated with the production and use of energy products produced by others which Shell purchases for resale. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the terms Shell’s “Net Carbon Intensity” or NCI are for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries.Shell’s net-zero emissions targetShell’s operating plan  outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly  they reflect our Scope 1  Scope 2 and NCI targets over the next ten years. However  Shell’s operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target  as this target is currently outside our planning period. In the future  as society moves towards net-zero emissions  we expect Shell’s operating plans to reflect this movement. However  if society is not net zero in 2050  as of today  there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.Forward-Looking non-GAAP measuresThis announcement may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as cash capital expenditure and divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell  such as oil and gas prices  interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover  estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc’s consolidated financial statements.The contents of websites referred to in this announcement do not form part of this announcement.We may have used certain terms  such as resources  in this announcement that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC.

It will reinforce Worldline competitiveness and structural mid-term profile  with full benefits expected in 2025.We also reached significant milestones regarding our joint-venture with Crédit Agricole  after having received an unconditional agreement from the European Commission. We have now launched the JV  branded CAWL  headed by Meriem Echcherfi with a confirmed objective to go live early 2025. It is another key step in our strategic partnership with the Crédit Agricole in France  a highly promising market for Worldline.Finally  we have recently announced the cooptation of Wilfried Verstraete as future Chairman and an evolution and a resizing of our Board of Directors  thus reshaping the group’s governance for Worldline’s next strategic phase that we will detail during a Capital Market Day planned for the second half of 2024.Based on these first quarter achievements  we fully confirm that we are well advanced in our transition to a streamlined Group through a reinforced focus  rigorous execution and the combined support of our talents and strategic partners.”Q1 2024 revenue by Global Business LineIn € million Q12024 Q42023* Organic growth (Published) Organic growth (NNR) Merchant Services 787 757 +3.9% +2.9% Financial Services 225 229 -1.4% -0.6% Mobility & e-Transactional Services 85 84 +0.7% +0.7% Worldline 1 097 1 070 +2.5% +1.7%* at constant scope and exchange ratesWorldline’s Q1 2024 revenue reached € 1 097 million  representing +2.5% organic growth. Merchants Services division was resilient in the current macroeconomic context and termination of merchant contracts were slightly offset by the underlying growth of our acceptance activities  and the commercial momentum in Italy. Financial Services division was impacted by low volumes in Account payments activity despite good underlying volumes in Acquiring and Issuing processing. Mobility & e-Transactional Services benefited from good dynamic in security and cryptographic solutions as well as ticketing volume increase.Merchant ServicesMerchant Services’ revenue in Q1 2024 reached € 787 million  representing an organic growth of +3.9% (+6.5% excluding merchant termination). Despite good results achieved in the new markets addressed  such as Italy  the quarter was impacted by the continuously soft macro-economic context and the termination of some specific merchants’ contracts. The performance by division was the following:Commercial Acquiring: Soft growth impacted as expected by termination of merchant contracts  with a good underlying growth driven by commercial momentum in Italy and resilient activity in Switzerland.Payment Acceptance: Good performance led by Travel and Gaming transactional online volumes benefitting from the good ramp-up of contracts signed last year. Digital Services: Robust results thanks to sustained business in Germany and Türkiye.Merchant Services growth profile should improve along the year with a progressive growth re-acceleration in the second half of the year due to a more normative comparison basis.On the online cross-border   Worldline signed recently a strategic partnership with Lidio  one of Türkiye’s leading Fintech companies  to offer a direct access to local payment means  such as Troy cards  through domestic corridor. In addition  Worldline is the first online payment service provider authorized by the Turkish central for international payments. With this authorization and with the partnership with Lidio  Worldline will help global online businesses to gain competitive advantage in the $72bn Turkish expanding e-commerce market.On the distribution side   Worldline reinforced its footprint in the fast-food industry with Tabesto  the order-taking and payment specialist. This ISV partnership will take place in 36 countries and will promote SoftPos Worldline Tap on Mobile technology to enhance ordering and payment kiosk experience.During the first quarter  commercial activity in Merchant Services has been dynamic with many contracts signed  in particular in the EV charging industry  such as Electra  Road  Kempower  as well as in the Hospitality vertical (Preferred Hotels & Resorts)  and in the Retail sector with ASDA.Financial ServicesQ1 2024 revenue reached € 225 million  implying -1.4% organic growth  despite a good dynamic in acquiring and issuing processing. The performance by division was the following:Card-based payment processing activities (Issuing Processing and Acquiring Processing): Good level of performance fueled by project activity  in particular with ING  and improved volumes in Belgium and the Netherlands.Digital Banking: Stable overall despite higher customer demand for Sanctions Securities and Monitoring solutions in Belgium and the Luxembourg.Account Payments: Activity was impacted by lower volumes in Germany and Italy  which were not offset by deliveries on EPC projects.After a stabilization of the activity in H1  Financial Services should slow down in the second half with lower volumes on existing contracts and some re-insourcing processes  partially offset by improving commercial dynamics on fertilization projects.On the commercial front  following the completed migration of Consorsbank’s Visa Card Portfolio and as a testament to the success of the migration  Financial Services signed several contracts extension with Consorsbank  a German brand of BNP Paribas  for Worldline’s issuing processing solution.Mobility & e-Transactional ServicesMobility & e-Transactional Services revenue reached € 85 million  up +0.7% organically  driven by a good dynamic on our security and cryptographic solution as well as ticketing volume increase. The performance by division was the following:Trusted Services*: Good momentum driven by new sales of security hardware  additional licenses and business with our cryptographic solution for e-health in Germany.Transport & Mobility*: Significant performance led by project activity in rail industry and increased volumes on e-ticketing in the UK. Finally  Omnichannel interactions*: Solid pipeline but impacted by projects delivery delays in France.Mobility & e-Transactional Services growth is expected to improve throughout the year.In terms of business  Worldline secured a five-year contract renewal in the UK and Ireland with a large customer to continue to deliver data and customer information systems and application support services in the rail industry. We also continued to expand our full offering covering billing  invoicing and card management solution with a major integrated energy company.

Announced one year ago  the joint-venture aims to become a major player in payment services in France. It will leverage Worldline’s technological performance and innovation capabilities and will integrate the ""Cartes Bancaires"" (CB) domestic payment scheme.Laurent Bennet  Chief Executive Officer of Crédit Agricole des Savoie  was elected Chairman of the Board of Directors of the joint venture and Meriem Echcherfi was appointed Chief Executive Officer.This new entity  branded CAWL  will offer all-in-one payment solutions combining acceptance and acquisition and integrating value-added services specific to each business sector: industry-vertical offerings that will simplify merchants’ processes and allow them to focus on the development of their business.CAWL is still expected to become fully operational and start generating sales and gross operating income as early as 2025  in line with our initial plan.Governance updateNew Chairman of the Board of directorsWorldline’s Board of directors met on March 20th  2024  and upon recommendation of the Nomination Committee  decided to coopt Wilfried Verstraete as independent director  replacing Bernard Bourigeaud. Wilfried Verstraete will be proposed for election  by the Board of directors  as Chairman of the Board of directors following the company’s Annual General Meeting on June 13th  2024.Wilfried Verstraete joined the Strategy and Investment committee as well as the Nomination committee and was immediately involved in the Company’s strategic priorities  as well as in the expected Board of directors’ evolution.The nomination of Wilfried Verstraete marked a new chapter in Worldline’s development and will allow the Company to successfully enter this new transformation phase.Evolution of the composition of the Board of DirectorsWorldline is continuously adapting its organization and governance to better respond to the rapidly evolving payment industry whilst accelerating the execution of its strategy. In this context  the Group announced that its Board of directors' composition is expected to be reduced from 15 to 12 Board members (plus two employee directors whose designation follows a dedicated procedure) following the next Annual General Meeting on June 13th  2024.Details of the contemplated changes are as follow:Ms. Agnès Park and Ms. Sylvia Steinmann to join as independent Directors  bringing strong expertise from leading positions in large companies and complex environments.Mr. Olivier Gavalda  deputy CEO of Credit Agricole SA in charge of Universal Banking  to join upon the proposal of Crédit Agricole SA  bringing strong banking  financial and payments industry expertise.The renewed Board will have a largely international profile with a diversified set of skills to support the Group’s strategic transformation.As previously announced  Wilfried Verstraete will chair this new Board of Directors  which Interim Chairman Georges Pauget has decided to leave after the AGM and a successful transition period.In line with its past commitments  Worldline’s Board of Directors will therefore be reduced from 15 to 12 members (excluding two employee representatives)  with three new entrants and six members resigning.All 2024 objectives confirmedOrganic revenue growth of at least 3%  assuming unchanged macro environment in core geographies with softer growth in H1’24 mainly due to merchants’ termination impact (Implied organic revenue growth above 5% excluding such termination impact).Adjusted EBITDA of at least € 1.17 billion  with first benefits of Power24 ramp-up associated to operating leverage accelerating in H2’24.Free cash flow of at least € 230 million  Including c.€ 150-170 million one-off Power24 implementation costs.AppendicesRECONCILIATION OF Q1 2023 STATUTORY REVENUE WITH Q1 2023 REVENUE AT CONSTANT SCOPE AND EXCHANGE RATESFor the analysis of the Group’s performance  Q1 2023 revenue at constant scope and exchange rates as presented below per Global Business Lines:In € million Q1 2023 Scope effects** Exchange rates effects Q1 2023* Merchant Services 758 3 -3 757 Financial Services 228 0 0 229 Mobility & e-Transactional Services 84 0 1 84 Worldline 1 070 3 -3 1 070 * At constant scope and March 2024 YTD average exchange rates ** At December 2023 YTD average exchange ratesExchanges rates effect in Q1 were mainly due to depreciation of Australian Dollar  and Turkish Lira while scope effects are mainly related to the integration of Banco Desio within MS division.2023 ESTIMATED PRO FORMAFY 2023 estimated pro forma at constant scope is presented below (per Global Business Lines):2023 estimated proforma* Revenue Revenue Revenue Revenue Revenue Revenue Revenue In € million Q1 Q2 H1 Q3 Q4 H2 FY Merchant Services 760 850 1 611 868 849 1 717 3 327 Financial Services 228 236 464 232 248 480 944 Mobility & e-Transactional Services 84 87 171 81 89 171 342 Worldline 1 073 1 173 2 246 1 181 1 186 2 367 4 612 In € million Adj.

Beyfortus reduced respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) hospitalizations by 82% (95% CI: 65.6 to 90.2) in infants under 6 months of age  compared to infants who received no RSV intervention  according to the interim results of an ongoing study published in The Lancet. These results  from the first RSV season after Beyfortus’ introduction  are part of the three-year NIRSE-GAL study conducted in Galicia  Spain under a collaborative framework with the Galician Directorate of Public Health of the Xunta de Galicia (Galician government) and Sanofi.1The results echo real-world evidence (RWE) reported from several broad infant immunization programs across the US  Spain and France during the 2023-2024 RSV season  which add to the consistent and high efficacy seen in pivotal clinical studies with Beyfortus. Real-world evidence demonstrates if a treatment or immunization is effective in day-to-day practice  as opposed to “efficacy” determined in carefully controlled clinical trials. A favorable safety profile was observed following Beyfortus use  consistent with clinical study results.1-10Federico Martinon TorresHead of Pediatrics  Hospital Clínico Universitario Santiago  Spain and principal investigator of NIRSE-GAL study“Galicia provides the first population-based real-world evidence of the impact of nirsevimab to prevent RSV disease in infants  showing a reduction by almost 90% in the number of hospitalizations due to this virus when compared with several previous RSV seasons. This achievement is the result of the exemplary pragmatic collaboration among scientists  industry  healthcare providers and policy makers aligned with a carefully planned roll-out of the immunization campaign  and the outstanding response of the Galician parents to this prophylaxis campaign.”Thomas TriompheExecutive Vice President  Vaccines  Sanofi“The scale and speed of impact seen after Beyfortus’ introduction demonstrates the strength of all-infant immunization strategies against RSV in babies. In Galicia  we saw an effectiveness of 82% in reducing RSV hospitalizations following the launch of Beyfortus  with more than 90% of eligible infants immunized. A growing body of evidence from these programs support policymakers  healthcare providers and parents who share our collective ambition to safeguard babies from RSV disease.”NIRSE-GAL is a large  population-based  three-year follow-up study to evaluate the effectiveness of Beyfortus following its inclusion in the Galician immunization schedule. The study aims to measure the impact of Beyfortus on hospitalizations due to RSV  all-cause lower respiratory tract disease  severe lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV  all-cause lower respiratory tract disease hospitalizations  and all-cause hospitalizations among infants born during the RSV season  infants under 6 months of age at the start of the season  and children aged 6-24 months who are vulnerable to severe RSV disease at the start of the season. The 2023-2024 immunization campaign ran from September 25  2023 to March 31  2024.1RWE from countries with Beyfortus all-infant immunization programs in 2023-24In addition to this new effectiveness study  evidence of the high impact following Beyfortus’ introduction has been consistently shown in several other real-world studies.An interim analysis of 2023-24 surveillance data published in the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) shows a single dose of Beyfortus was 90% effective in preventing hospitalizations due to RSV in babies who were immunized below 8 months of age. 2(MMWR) shows a single dose of Beyfortus was 90% effective in preventing hospitalizations due to RSV in babies who were immunized below 8 months of age. A recent draft recommendation from Haute Autorité de Santé in France reported  across six hospitals  an effectiveness of 83% against RSV-associated hospitalization in infants who received Beyfortus compared to those with no intervention. 3in France reported  across six hospitals  an effectiveness of 83% against RSV-associated hospitalization in infants who received Beyfortus compared to those with no intervention. In Catalonia  Spain  a study pre-printed in The Lancet showed reductions of 87.6% and 90.1% in hospital and ICU admissions for RSV  respectively  among babies born before the start of the RSV season  who were eligible to receive Beyfortus  compared to those with no intervention. 4showed reductions of 87.6% and 90.1% in hospital and ICU admissions for RSV  respectively  among babies born before the start of the RSV season  who were eligible to receive Beyfortus  compared to those with no intervention. A pooled analysis of data from three Spanish regions  including Valencia  Murcia  and Valladolid  showed an 84.4% effectiveness in preventing hospitalizations due to RSV in infants under 9 months of age versus infants who received no intervention. The results were published in Eurosurveillance . 5. A study from Navarra  Spain published in Vaccines found an effectiveness of 88.7% in preventing hospitalizations among infants immunized at birth with Beyfortus  compared to no intervention.6The expansion of the Beyfortus manufacturing network is progressing well and according to plan. This expansion will allow Sanofi and AstraZeneca to more than triple manufacturing capacity. Based on this  and assuming regulatory validations are delivered in due time by regulatory agencies  Sanofi and AstraZeneca are confident to meet global commitments and build inventory that can be used in future RSV seasons. In addition  the companies are producing Beyfortus well in advance of the RSV season  with the vast majority of doses planned to be available by October.About RSVRSV is a highly contagious virus that can lead to serious respiratory illness for infants.11 Two out of three infants are infected with RSV during their first year of life and almost all children are infected by their second birthday.11 12 RSV is the most common cause of lower respiratory tract disease  including bronchiolitis and pneumonia  in infants.13 It is also a leading cause of hospitalization in infants worldwide  with most hospitalizations for RSV occurring in healthy infants born at term.14-17 Globally  in 2019  there were approximately 33 million cases of acute lower respiratory infections leading to more than 3 million hospitalizations  and it was estimated that there were 26 300 in-hospital deaths of children younger than 5 years.18 RSV-related direct medical costs  globally — including hospital  outpatient and follow-up care — were estimated at €4.82 billion in 2017.19About BeyfortusBeyfortus (nirsevimab) is the first immunization designed for all infants for protection against RSV through their first RSV season  including for those born healthy at term or preterm  or with specific health conditions that make them vulnerable to RSV disease. Beyfortus is also designed to protect children up to 24 months of age who remain vulnerable to severe RSV disease through their second RSV season.As a long-acting antibody provided directly to newborns and infants as a single dose  Beyfortus offers rapid protection to help prevent lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV without requiring activation of the immune system. Beyfortus administration can be timed to coincide with the RSV season.In March 2017  Sanofi and AstraZeneca announced an agreement to develop and commercialize Beyfortus. Under the terms of the agreement  AstraZeneca leads development and manufacturing activities and Sanofi leads commercialization activities and records revenues. Under the terms of the global agreement  Sanofi made an upfront payment of €120m  has paid development and regulatory milestones of €120m and will pay up to a further €375m upon achievement of certain regulatory and sales-related milestones. The two companies share costs and profits in all territories except in the US where Sanofi consolidates 100% of the economic benefits in its Business Operating Income.Beyfortus has been approved for use in the European Union  the US  China  Japan  and many other countries around the world. Special designations to facilitate expedited development of Beyfortus were granted by several regulatory agencies  including Breakthrough Therapy Designation and Priority Review designation by The China Center for Drug Evaluation under the National Medical Products Administration; Breakthrough Therapy Designation and Fast Track Designation from the US Food and Drug Administration; access granted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) PRIority MEdicines (PRIME) scheme and EMA accelerated assessment; Promising Innovative Medicine designation by the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency; and Beyfortus has been named “a medicine for prioritized development” under the Project for Drug Selection to Promote New Drug Development in Pediatrics by the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development.About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people’s lives.

Beyfortus reduced respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) hospitalizations by 82% (95% CI: 65.6 to 90.2) in infants under 6 months of age  compared to infants who received no RSV intervention  according to the interim results of an ongoing study published in The Lancet. These results  from the first RSV season after Beyfortus’ introduction  are part of the three-year NIRSE-GAL study conducted in Galicia  Spain under a collaborative framework with the Galician Directorate of Public Health of the Xunta de Galicia (Galician government) and Sanofi.1The results echo real-world evidence (RWE) reported from several broad infant immunization programs across the US  Spain and France during the 2023-2024 RSV season  which add to the consistent and high efficacy seen in pivotal clinical studies with Beyfortus. Real-world evidence demonstrates if a treatment or immunization is effective in day-to-day practice  as opposed to “efficacy” determined in carefully controlled clinical trials. A favorable safety profile was observed following Beyfortus use  consistent with clinical study results.1-10Federico Martinon TorresHead of Pediatrics  Hospital Clínico Universitario Santiago  Spain and principal investigator of NIRSE-GAL study“Galicia provides the first population-based real-world evidence of the impact of nirsevimab to prevent RSV disease in infants  showing a reduction by almost 90% in the number of hospitalizations due to this virus when compared with several previous RSV seasons. This achievement is the result of the exemplary pragmatic collaboration among scientists  industry  healthcare providers and policy makers aligned with a carefully planned roll-out of the immunization campaign  and the outstanding response of the Galician parents to this prophylaxis campaign.”Thomas TriompheExecutive Vice President  Vaccines  Sanofi“The scale and speed of impact seen after Beyfortus’ introduction demonstrates the strength of all-infant immunization strategies against RSV in babies. In Galicia  we saw an effectiveness of 82% in reducing RSV hospitalizations following the launch of Beyfortus  with more than 90% of eligible infants immunized. A growing body of evidence from these programs support policymakers  healthcare providers and parents who share our collective ambition to safeguard babies from RSV disease.”NIRSE-GAL is a large  population-based  three-year follow-up study to evaluate the effectiveness of Beyfortus following its inclusion in the Galician immunization schedule. The study aims to measure the impact of Beyfortus on hospitalizations due to RSV  all-cause lower respiratory tract disease  severe lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV  all-cause lower respiratory tract disease hospitalizations  and all-cause hospitalizations among infants born during the RSV season  infants under 6 months of age at the start of the season  and children aged 6-24 months who are vulnerable to severe RSV disease at the start of the season. The 2023-2024 immunization campaign ran from September 25  2023 to March 31  2024.1RWE from countries with Beyfortus all-infant immunization programs in 2023-24In addition to this new effectiveness study  evidence of the high impact following Beyfortus’ introduction has been consistently shown in several other real-world studies.An interim analysis of 2023-24 surveillance data published in the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) shows a single dose of Beyfortus was 90% effective in preventing hospitalizations due to RSV in babies who were immunized below 8 months of age. 2A recent draft recommendation from Haute Autorité de Santé in France reported  across six hospitals  an effectiveness of 83% against RSV-associated hospitalization in infants who received Beyfortus compared to those with no intervention. 3In Catalonia  Spain  a study pre-printed in The Lancet showed reductions of 87.6% and 90.1% in hospital and ICU admissions for RSV  respectively  among babies born before the start of the RSV season  who were eligible to receive Beyfortus  compared to those with no intervention. 4A pooled analysis of data from three Spanish regions  including Valencia  Murcia  and Valladolid  showed an 84.4% effectiveness in preventing hospitalizations due to RSV in infants under 9 months of age versus infants who received no intervention. The results were published in Eurosurveillance. 5A study from Navarra  Spain published in Vaccines found an effectiveness of 88.7% in preventing hospitalizations among infants immunized at birth with Beyfortus  compared to no intervention.6The expansion of the Beyfortus manufacturing network is progressing well and according to plan. This expansion will allow Sanofi and AstraZeneca to more than triple manufacturing capacity. Based on this  and assuming regulatory validations are delivered in due time by regulatory agencies  Sanofi and AstraZeneca are confident to meet global commitments and build inventory that can be used in future RSV seasons. In addition  the companies are producing Beyfortus well in advance of the RSV season  with the vast majority of doses planned to be available by October.About RSVRSV is a highly contagious virus that can lead to serious respiratory illness for infants.11 Two out of three infants are infected with RSV during their first year of life and almost all children are infected by their second birthday.11 12 RSV is the most common cause of lower respiratory tract disease  including bronchiolitis and pneumonia  in infants.13 It is also a leading cause of hospitalization in infants worldwide  with most hospitalizations for RSV occurring in healthy infants born at term.14-17 Globally  in 2019  there were approximately 33 million cases of acute lower respiratory infections leading to more than 3 million hospitalizations  and it was estimated that there were 26 300 in-hospital deaths of children younger than 5 years.18 RSV-related direct medical costs  globally — including hospital  outpatient and follow-up care — were estimated at €4.82 billion in 2017.19About BeyfortusBeyfortus (nirsevimab) is the first immunization designed for all infants for protection against RSV through their first RSV season  including for those born healthy at term or preterm  or with specific health conditions that make them vulnerable to RSV disease. Beyfortus is also designed to protect children up to 24 months of age who remain vulnerable to severe RSV disease through their second RSV season.As a long-acting antibody provided directly to newborns and infants as a single dose  Beyfortus offers rapid protection to help prevent lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV without requiring activation of the immune system. Beyfortus administration can be timed to coincide with the RSV season.In March 2017  Sanofi and AstraZeneca announced an agreement to develop and commercialize Beyfortus. Under the terms of the agreement  AstraZeneca leads development and manufacturing activities and Sanofi leads commercialization activities and records revenues. Under the terms of the global agreement  Sanofi made an upfront payment of €120m  has paid development and regulatory milestones of €120m and will pay up to a further €375m upon achievement of certain regulatory and sales-related milestones. The two companies share costs and profits in all territories except in the US where Sanofi consolidates 100% of the economic benefits in its Business Operating Income.Beyfortus has been approved for use in the European Union  the US  China  Japan  and many other countries around the world. Special designations to facilitate expedited development of Beyfortus were granted by several regulatory agencies  including Breakthrough Therapy Designation and Priority Review designation by The China Center for Drug Evaluation under the National Medical Products Administration; Breakthrough Therapy Designation and Fast Track Designation from the US Food and Drug Administration; access granted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) PRIority MEdicines (PRIME) scheme and EMA accelerated assessment; Promising Innovative Medicine designation by the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency; and Beyfortus has been named “a medicine for prioritized development” under the Project for Drug Selection to Promote New Drug Development in Pediatrics by the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development.About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people’s lives.

These non-IFRS measures (also known as alternative performance indicators) are presented because management considers them important supplemental measures of UMG's performance and believes that they are widely used in the industry in which UMG operates as a means of evaluating a company's operating performance and liquidity. UMG believes that an understanding of its sales performance  profitability  financial strength and funding requirements is enhanced by reporting the following non-IFRS measures. All non-IFRS measures should be considered in addition to  and not as a substitute for  other IFRS measures of operating and financial performance as described in this press release. In addition  it should be noted that other companies may have definitions and calculations for these non-IFRS measures that differ from those used by UMG  thereby affecting comparability.EBITDA and EBITDA marginUMG considers EBITDA and EBITDA margin  non-IFRS measures  to be relevant measures to assess its operating performance and the performance of its operating segments as reported in the segment data. It enables UMG to compare the performance of operating segments regardless of whether their performance is driven by the operating segment's organic growth or by acquisitions. It excludes restructuring expenses  which may impact period-to-period comparability. EBITDA margin is EBITDA divided by revenue. To calculate EBITDA  the accounting impact of the following items is excluded from the Operating Profit:i. amortization of intangible assets;ii. impairment on goodwill and other intangibles;iii. depreciation of tangible assets including right of use assets;iv. (gains)/losses on the sale of tangible assets  including right of use assets and intangible assets; andv. restructuring expenses.Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA marginThe difference between EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA consists of non-cash share-based compensation expenses and certain one-time items that are deemed by management to be significant and incidental to normal business activity. Adjusted EBITDA margin is Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue. UMG considers Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin  non-IFRS measures  to be relevant measures to assess performance of its operating activities excluding items that may be incidental to normal business activity and excluding non-cash share based compensation which may impact period-to-period comparability.Logo - https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/512308/UMG.jpg",neutral,0.03,0.96,0.01,mixed,0.26,0.24,0.51,True,English,"['Universal Music Group N.V.', 'Financial Results', 'First Quarter', 'Universal Music Group N.V.', 'lower non-cash share-based compensation expenses', 'incremental cash compensation savings', 'International Accounting Standards Board', 'International Financial Reporting Standards', 'Recorded Music subscription revenue', 'strong Adjusted EBITDA growth', 'Recorded Music revenues', 'Sir Lucian Grainge', 'alternative performance indicators', 'Music Publishing revenue', 'equity plan rollout', 'other digital revenue', 'current year rates', 'Q1 2024 Results Highlights1', 'Adjusted EBITDA margin', 'current year results', 'prior year results', 'financial results', 'strong start', 'other revenue', 'exceptional performance', 'strategic plan', 'revenue growth', 'margin expansion', 'streaming revenue', 'Physical revenue', 'solid growth', 'healthy growth', 'constant currency', 'Top sellers', 'Taylor Swift', 'Noah Kahan', 'Morgan Wallen', 'Ariana Grande', 'Olivia Rodrigo', 'press release', 'The Netherlands', 'continuing success', 'large measure', 'experienced teams', 'integrated portfolio', 'Boyd Muir', 'healthy start', 'Three Months', 'YoY const', 'operating leverage', 'global subscribers', 'continued benefit', 'price increases', 'download sales', 'industry-wide decline', 'first quarter', 'advertising industry', 'UMG Results', 'difficult year', 'year comparison', 'IFRS measures', 'segments', 'EU', 'descriptions', 'reconciliations', 'Appendix', 'HILVERSUM', 'May', 'Company', 'fact', 'artists', 'center', 'everything', 'broad-based', 'strategically', 'businesses', 'Chairman', 'CEO', 'world', 'EVP', 'CFO', 'President', 'Operations', 'trajectory', 'execution', 'plans', 'years', 'millions', 'Note', 'March', 'Subscriptions', 'Downloads', 'License', 'platforms', 'Japan', '7.', '31']",2024-05-02,2024-05-03,prnewswire.co.uk

This increase reflects lower non-cash share-based compensation expenses of €101 million during the first quarter of 2024  compared to €261 million of non-cash share-based compensation expenses during the first quarter of 2023. Excluding non-cash share-based compensation expenses  Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was €591 million  up 13.2% year-over-year  or 15.9% in constant currency  and Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 1.5 percentage points to 22.8%  compared to 21.3% in the first quarter of 2023  as a result of revenue growth  operating leverage and incremental cash compensation savings of €12 million associated with the equity plan rollout compared to the first quarter of 2023.Recorded MusicThree Months Ended March 31  % % (in millions of euros) 2024 2023 YoY const.(unaudited) (unaudited)Subscriptions and streaming revenue 1 466 1 329 10.3 % 12.0 % of which streaming 343 315 8.9 % 10.3 % of which subscription 1 123 1 014 10.7 % 12.5 % Downloads and other digital revenue 46 55 (16.4 %) (13.2 %) Physical revenue 255 313 (18.5 %) (14.4 %) License and other revenue 222 226 (1.8 %) (0.4 %) Recorded Music revenues 1 989 1 923 3.4 % 5.6 %Note: % YoY indicates % change year-over-year; % const. indicates % change year-over-year adjusted for constant currency.Q1 2024Recorded Music revenue for the first quarter of 2024 was €1 989 million  up 3.4% compared to the first quarter of 2023  or 5.6% in constant currency.

Streaming revenue grew 8.9% year-over-year  or 10.3% in constant currency  as the advertising industry continued to recover. Physical revenue decreased by 18.5% year-over-year  or 14.4% in constant currency  largely due to a very difficult year-over-year comparison  particularly in Japan.

License and other revenue declined 1.8% year-over-year  or 0.4% in constant currency  due to a timing-related decline in synchronization revenue.

Technip Energies (the “Company”)  a leading Engineering & Technology company for the energy transition  today announces its unaudited financial results for the first quarter of 2024.Arnaud Pieton  Chief Executive Officer of Technip Energies  commented:“Our solid first quarter provides a robust platform to deliver our full year guidance. Our two segments achieved year-over-year revenue growth and earnings per share increased by 11 percent on the strength of the business performance.”“Operationally  both segments are performing well. In Project Delivery  key LNG projects are ramping up in the Middle East  and in Technology  Products & Services - TPS - we made good progress both in the delivery of ethylene furnaces and in high-value engineering services across our businesses. Likewise  commercial momentum in TPS remained strong with order intake significantly in excess of segment revenue  benefiting from high demand  notably in carbon capture and project management consultancy. Overall  a solid start to 2024  and I want to express my gratitude to our teams that continue to drive our leading performance.”“We advanced on the delivery of our full year priorities  including strengthening our leadership in low-carbon  electrified LNG and net-zero solutions. We were selected for a major low-carbon LNG development on ADNOC's Ruwais project in the UAE  and  in April  were awarded a substantial contract for Marsa LNG in Oman - both are destined to be amongst the lowest-carbon intensity LNG plants ever built. In addition  a T.EN-led consortium was selected for a large carbon capture infrastructure in the UK for bp's Net Zero Teesside  pending final investment decision. These achievements demonstrate T.EN’s commitment to energy supply  net-zero ambitions  and geographic diversification.”“At the same time  we continue to innovate and drive decarbonization in our markets  including ethylene. Together with our partner LanzaTech  we were recognized by the US Department of Energy with an up to $200 million investment for a commercial facility to produce ethylene from CO 2 . And  with the launch of EkWil  a joint venture with SBM Offshore  we aim to deliver competitive solutions for the nascent floating offshore wind sector.”“The path to net-zero is multi-dimensional; markets are moving at different paces in different geographies with greater near-term focus on real world issues  namely energy security and affordability. While natural gas remains a global market  cleantech industries - including carbon capture  sustainable fuels and clean hydrogen - are shaping up to be more regionalized.”“As a global delivery partner with local expertise  I am confident that we have the right strategy with the right people and capabilities to capture value in this dynamic environment.”Key financials – adjusted IFRS(In € millions  except EPS and %) Q1 2024 Q1 2023 Revenue 1 520.8 1 406.5 Recurring EBIT 110.7 107.3 Recurring EBIT margin % 7.3% 7.6% Net profit 90.1 80.0 Diluted earnings per share(1) €0.50 €0.45 Order intake 849.9 712.7 Backlog 15 258.8 12 047.3 Financial information is presented under adjusted IFRS (see Appendix 8.0 for complete definition).

Adjusted recurring EBIT: represents profit before financial expense  net  and income taxes recorded under IFRS as adjusted to reflect line-by-line for their respective share incorporated construction project entities that are not fully owned by the Company (applying to the method described above under Adjusted Revenue) and adds or removes  as appropriate  items that are considered as non-recurring from EBIT (such as restructuring expenses  costs arising out of significant litigation that have arisen outside of the ordinary course of business and other non-recurring expenses). The Company believes that the exclusion of such expenses or profits from these financial measures enables investors and management to evaluate the Company’s operations and consolidated results of operations period-over-period  and to identify operating trends that could otherwise be masked to both investors and management by the excluded items.represents profit before financial expense  net  and income taxes recorded under IFRS as adjusted to reflect line-by-line for their respective share incorporated construction project entities that are not fully owned by the Company (applying to the method described above under Adjusted Revenue) and adds or removes  as appropriate  items that are considered as non-recurring from EBIT (such as restructuring expenses  costs arising out of significant litigation that have arisen outside of the ordinary course of business and other non-recurring expenses).

Hopefully  you will find this content useful. Market myths are generally perpetuated by repetition  misleading symbolic connections  and the complete ignorance of facts. The world of finance is full of such tendencies  and here  you'll see some examples. Please keep in mind that not all of these examples are totally misleading -- they are sometimes valid -- but have too many holes in them to be worthwhile as investment concepts. And not all are directly related to investing and finance. Enjoy! - GregRelative StrengthBack in the 1970s  we used to have an indicator that looked at the volume on the American Stock Exchange (AMEX)  also known as the curb  and the volume on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE)  known as the big board. It was called The Speculation Index. The AMEX consisted of small  relatively illiquid issues  generally all that could not make the listing requirements of the NYSE. The ratio of AMEX volume to NYSE volume was thought to represent excessive optimism when it reached a certain level.In perfect hindsight  I think if we had used it as a trend indicator  it would have been more valuable. Identify the rising path of speculation and as the volume of the AMEX increased relative to that of the NYSE  you would be in a good uptrend.Note: In 2008  the AMEX was acquired by the NYSE Euronext  which announced that the exchange would be renamed the NYSE Alternext US. The latter was renamed NYSE Amex Equities in March 2009. These changes have made stand-alone AMEX trading volumes difficult to source and track  as a result of which  the speculation index has lost much of its relevance as a measure of speculative activity.Small-Cap vs. Large-Cap ComponentSmall-cap participation is critical for sustained uptrends in the market because small-caps reflect speculation and speculation is a requirement for uptrends. For small capitalization issues  the Russell 2000 Index is used  and for large capitalization issues  the venerable S&P 500 Index is used. The math is simply to create the ratio of the small to large  then use technical analysis to provide a normalized trend measure.In Figure 13.19 the typical Nasdaq Composite is in the top plot  along with the small-cap large-cap binary. The middle plot is just the ratio of the small to large issues  and the lower plot is the small-cap large-cap weight of the evidence measure. In this example  you can see that small caps dominated the up move near the center of the chart  but have been relatively weak since. If you think about it  small caps also more closely relate to breadth.Growth vs. Value ComponentThis component of relative strength measures the difference between growth stocks and value stocks. Now this will shock most folks who have studied the markets  but I use small-cap issues for both the growth and value components. I was initially concerned that small cap value was almost an oxymoron  but the data has proved time and time again that it is perfectly valid. Figure 13.20 shows the growth value ratio in the middle  with the growth value weight of the evidence measure in the bottom plot and its binary overlaid in the top plot.Breadth vs. Price ComponentThere is only one more relative strength measure to view  the relationship between breadth and price. For breadth  a relationship between the advancing issues and the declining issues is used  while the Nasdaq Composite is used for price. The middle plot in Figure 13.21 shows the raw ratio of those two  with the price to breadth weight of the evidence measure in the lower plot and its binary in the top plot. This is an excellent example of how technical manipulation of the data can turn that noisy middle plot into something like the bottom plot  and a good trend measure.Relative Strength Compound MeasureThis compound measure (see the previous article) is designed to measure market sentiment. Are investors actively taking investment risk? Or are they behaving much more bearishly? Again  there are three indicators that drive this component and are shown above. These indicators look at the relationship between small-cap issues vs. large-cap issues  growth-oriented issues vs. value issues  and breadth measurements vs. price measurements.For example  when small-caps are dominant (small-caps outperforming large-caps) it is generally a sign of more speculation taking place in the markets  as investors are willing to accept more risk. This is generally a good sign  and it is during these environments that the markets generally perform well historically. When large-caps are dominant  it is usually the result of a flight to quality  as investors are taking risk off the table. This type of investor sentiment usually results in less favorable market conditions.A similar relationship exists between growth and value. When growth issues are outperforming  it is generally because the market is pricing in favorable growth estimates  and conversely  when value issues are dominating  it is because the market is no longer pricing in such optimistic positive growth estimates. The breadth vs. price measurement is similar to an equal-weighted measurement versus a capitalization-weighted measurement. Again  we are using three indicators in this component for confirmation purposes. When this relative strength component is on  it is adding value to the weight of the evidence of the model by letting me know that the sentiment in the markets is favorable and is viewed more as a trend confirmation measure versus a trend identification measure.Figure 13.22 is a chart showing lots of data but includes all three components of the relative strength measure. The top plot is the Nasdaq Composite with the compound binary measure overlaid. The binary measure for each of the components is also shows overlaid on their respective plots.Figure 13.23 is the same as the preceding figure  but with less data displayed.Dominant IndexA concept known as the Dominant Index measures the relative strength between the Nasdaq Composite and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) Composite. The Nasdaq is generally dominated by small capitalization issues and the NYSE is dominated by large capitalization issues. Therefore  a measure that shows which is outperforming is also showing whether small cap issues are outperforming large-cap issues or vice versa.Figure 13.24 shows the Nasdaq Composite and the NYSE Composite in the top plot  with the relationship between the two displayed in the bottom plot. Whenever the line is above the horizontal line  it means the Nasdaq is performing better than the NYSE. In the last decade  the Nasdaq has grown considerably with many more large-cap issues  which somewhat hampers this measure.Trend Capturing MeasureThis is a truly important compound measure  which can drive the weight of the evidence or hold it back. The trend capturing measure  like many compound measures  consists of three independent indicators of trend  and in this case two are based on breadth and one on price. Any two measures saying there is an uptrend will work.Advance Decline ComponentThe advance decline component of the trend capturing measure uses the advances and declines difference and then mathematically puts that difference into a relationship similar to MACD (see Figure 13.25). The signals are given by the crossing of that formula with its shorter-term (10–18 periods) exponential moving average.Up Volume/Down Volume ComponentThe up volume/down volume component of the trend capturing measure (see Figure 13.26) uses the up volume and the down volume in a similar manner as the advance and decline measure in Figure 13.25. One could assume that these would be very similar as they are tied to the same price movement  one by daily changes  and one by the amount of volume behind those changes. However  in the up volume/down volume  the parameters used are somewhat longer than in the advance decline component.Price ComponentThe price component of the trend capturing measure (Figure 13.27)  like the other two components  uses a similar relationship  but this one uses parameters that are longer than the other two.Trend Capturing Compound MeasureThis is a major component of my model  because it ties directly with the investment philosophy of identifying positive market trends that have a high probability of continuing into the future. I never predict; I only have an expectation that the identified trend will continue.This component is a composite of three technical measurements. One is a price measure  and the other two are breadth measures  one of which uses up and down volume  and the other uses advancing and declining issues (see Figures 13.26 and 13.27). I use multiple indicators for confirmation purposes. For instance  when the first of these three indicators turns positive  it is telling us there is a positive price trend developing. When the second of these indicators turns positive  it provides confirmation of the trend  and if the third turns positive as well  I know I have a very solid trend in place. See Figure 13.28.LTM—Long-Term MeasureSometimes a good way to dampen things is to utilize a longer-term overlay measure  such as this Long-Term Measure (LTM). There are multiple ways to smooth out the noise in data  we've discussed one  the moving average  at length. The other  using weekly data  often does the same thing  sometimes even better.The long-term measure uses only weekly data. It has many components  such as weekly advances and declines  weekly new high/new low data  weekly up volume and down volume data  plus a price component that measures the relationship among many market indices and tracks their position relative to their long-term moving average. All of that data is calculated and then put together in a fairly complex manner to give the binary indicator shown in the top plot of Figure 13.29. It has an intermediate level  sort of a transition zone so that  as the long-term components go from being on to off  they pause in the transition zone to ensure there is follow through. This is a fairly slow moving measure and is best used to identify cyclical moves in the market. The best place to find weekly breadth data is from Dow Jones and Company  in either Barron's or The Wall Street Journal.Figure 13.30 shows the long-term measure over a shorter time frame so you can better see the action of each measure.Bull Market Conﬁrmation MeasureThe Bull Market Confirmation Measure is about as simple as it can get. (See Figure 13.31.) It just uses a 50 moving average and a filter to identify bull moves. It is calculated on the average price of the high  low  and close ((H+L+C)/3). The difference between the average price and its 50 period simple moving average is then adjusted to identifying only times when it is outside of the -5% and -10% range. As the average price drops below the -5% value it is a sell signal and when it rises above the -10% it is the buy signal. These crossover percentages are determined based on the price series you are using. They will probably be different for each one.Figures 13.31 and 13.32 is the Bull Market Confirmation measure with less data  so that you can see the turning points easier.Initial Trend Measures (ITM)A significant enhancement to a trend following model is an early warning set of indicators. I call them Initial Trend Measures  or Early Trend Measures. They are designed to measure trends just like the weight of the evidence measure does  but use shorter term parameters in an attempt to pick up or identify the trend at an earlier stage in its development. You can use as many short-term trend measures as you need  but usually 3 is more than enough if you have them in different categories of trend measurement  such as price  breadth  and relative strength.Figure 13.33 is one of the Initial Trend Measures that utilizes up volume compared to down volume. It can be either the Nasdaq data or the NYSE data. The top plot is the Nasdaq bar chart  with the indicator's binary wave overlaid on the price bars. Recall that the binary is at the top when the indicator is above its moving average and at the bottom when it is below its moving average.Figure 13.34 shows the Initial Trend Measure  which uses the advance decline data. Just like the other weight of the evidence measures  this uses an MACD approach.Figure 13.35 is another ITM  this one using price  and in this case it is the Nasdaq Composite Index that is used. This measure is similar to the trend measure mentioned earlier  but using short-term parameters.Figure 13.36 is a similar initial trend measure  but this one uses the NYSE Composite Index for price.The Initial Trend Measures provide an alert mechanism for the weight of the evidence. You will also see their use in the next chapter when used along with the trade up rules.Trend GaugeThis is a concept that was introduced to me by my friend Ted Wong (TTSWong Advisory)  referring to the use of multiple market indices and measuring their relationship to their moving average.Trend Gauge is comprised of Mega Trend Plus and Trend Strength. A concept that attempts to identify overall trendiness in the market is always going to be a valuable tool for a trend follower. For purposes of this example  I selected the ubiquitous 200-day exponential average  then smoothed the results with a three-day arithmetic average. There are a number of modifications one could do with this concept  including optimizing the moving average lengths for each of the market indices. I say that with this warning  optimization must be done properly to avoid curve fitting  and was discussed earlier in this chapter. I would start with moving average lengths that are closely tied to the trend lengths I want to focus on  and then use a short-term noise reduction smoothing like I did in this example.Mega Trend PlusMega Trend Plus is constructed by selecting 11 major indexes with the longest historical database. One could easily make the case for more or less indices and which indices are to be included. I would suggest using enough indices to give you broad coverage over how you plan to make investments. The Mega Trend Plus is also used in the Long-Term Measure (LTM)  but in that case it uses weekly data. Clearly if you are going to have a focus on international securities  you would want to include international indices. The list of indices used in this example is:Nasdaq CompositeS&P 500S&P 100Russell 2000Russell 2000 GrowthRussell 2000 ValueNew York CompositeDow Jones IndustrialsDow Jones TransportsDow Jones UtilitiesValue Line GeometricWhen the index is greater than its exponential moving average (EMA)  it receives a +1; below its EMA  it receives a -1. Then the scores from all 11 indexes are summed and then normalized so the composite will have a range between 0% and 100%. An uptrending market is called when the composite is greater than or equal to 85%. A downtrending market is when the composite is less than or equal to 15%. Once a threshold is crossed  the market stance stays until the opposite threshold is penetrated. Hence Mega Trend Plus is a digital meter: either bull or bear.Figure 13.37 shows the S&P 500 in the top plot  Mega Trend Plus in the lower plot  and the Mega Trend Plus binary overlaid on the S&P 500. The binary is at +1 when.ever Mega Trend Plus is greater than or equal to 85  at -1 whenever Mega Trend Plus is less than or equal to 15  and at zero when it is between 15 and 85. You can see that it does a reasonable job of trend identification. This is a weight of the evidence approach that is totally related to the concepts in this book.Trend StrengthTrend Strength is a different composite  which is the sum of 11 ratios. For each market index  a ratio is calculated with this formula: (price/EMA–1) x 100 percent. The EMA lengths are identical to those used in Mega Trend Plus. The ratio depicts how far away (up or down) the index is positioned relative to its EMA. Hence  Trend Strength is an oscillating analog meter that measures the momentum of each of the 11 market indexes (see Figure 13.38).Trend Gauge combines the readings from both the digital and analog meters (Mega Trend Plus and Trend Strength). It represents a weight of evidence approach in determining both the direction (digital) and the strength (analog) of the overall market trend. Figure 13.39 shows the S&P 500 in the top plot and Trend Gauge in the lower plot. Whenever the Trend Gauge is at +1  it has identified an uptrend; when at -1  it has identified a downtrend; and when at 0  there is neither an up- or downtrend (neutral).Figure 13.40 is the same data as in Figure 13.39   just over a much longer time frame. The beginning date in Figure 13.40 is 1992.Measuring the market is a significant component to a good trend following  rules-based model. This article and the previous one have introduced many measures that can be used individually or in groups to assist in trend identification. Clearly  there were many measures introduced  and hopefully you can find a few that will fit your needs. Also  hopefully you will not use all of them  as many are similar with minor deviations in their concept.Thanks for reading this far. I intend to publish one article in this series every week.

Mithra remains committed to negotiating with prospective buyers to enhance value  acting in the best interest of all stakeholders (see also press release of 29 April 2024 in this respect).The trading of Mithra shares on Euronext Brussels remains suspended pending the on-going negotiations.In addition  Mithra’s senior secured lenders have agreed to provide Mithra with continued funding through the previously announced uncommitted ""accordion facility""  for an amount of EUR 2.5 million  This additional funding creates expected cash runway to fund the business through mid-May  allowing additional time to finalize negotiations in the context of the monetization process. Mithra is currently also in the process of finalizing the draw-down of the remaining EUR 2.5 million under the aforementioned accordion facility  allowing to extend the period during which the negotiations can be finalized until the end of May.Background Information:On 5 March 2024  Mithra announced the launch of a comprehensive monetization process  exploring potential sales of selected assets  notably Estetra SRL  and potentially the entire business. Additionally  Mithra announced the entry into a secured bridge loan facility (“the Facility”) for an amount of up to EUR 13.5 million to be drawn in multiple tranches upon the satisfaction of certain milestones  as well as an uncommitted EUR 5 million ""accordion"" facility (which could be used once the committed amount has been fully drawn and only if the lenders consent). The lenders under the Facility consist of funds managed by Highbridge Capital Management  LLC and funds managed by Whitebox Advisors  LLC.For more information  please contact:Mithra Pharmaceuticals SAAlex Sokolowski  PhDHead of IR & Communicationsinvestorrelations@mithra.com +32 (0)4 349 28 22Frédérique DepraetereCommunications Directorinfo@mithra.com+32 (0)4 349 28 22About MithraMithra Pharmaceuticals SA (Euronext: MITRA) is a Belgian biopharmaceutical company dedicated to transforming women’s health by offering new choices through innovation  with a particular focus on contraception and menopause.
