In accordance with the principles established by the 2023 Annual General Meeting and the Swedish Corporate Governance Code  the Election Committee has been mandated to draw up proposals on the following issues to be presented at the Company's 2024 Annual General Meeting: election of Chairman to preside over the Annual General Meeting election of the Chairman and other Board members of the Company's Board ofDirectors Directors  resolution regarding directors' fees  divided between the Chairman and the other Board members  and any remuneration for committee work election of and fees to the auditor  andresolution on amendments to the instructions for the Election Committee. The Election Committee has held five (5) recorded meetings and maintained regular communications between the meetings. When preparing its proposal  the Election Committee has applied rule 4.1 of the Swedish Corporate Governance Code as its diversity policy. This entails that the Election Committee has had as a starting point that the Board of Directors shall have an appropriate composition with regard to the Company's operations  stage of development and circumstances in general  characterised by diversity and breadth in terms of the competence  experience and background of the members elected by the Annual General Meeting. An even gender ratio shall be sought. The Election Committee also considers it important that the Board members are able to devote the time and care required to carry out their duties as Board members of the Company  and the Election Committee has therefore evaluated the Directors' assignments outside the Company and the time required for these assignments. The Election Committee has received a report from the Chairman of the Board on how the work of the Board has been carried out. The Election Committee has interviewed the Board of Directors and its overall assessment of the work of the Board shows that the Board functions well. The Election Committee has discussed the size and composition of the Board in relation the Company's current situation and development opportunities.

The Election Committee's proposals for the election of auditor and resolution regarding auditor fees are in line with the recommendation of the Audit Committee.

The Election Committee's proposal regarding the Board of Directors entails that 33 per cent of the Board members elected by the General Meeting would be women and 67 per cent of the Board members elected by the General Meeting would be men. The Election Committee is continually striving to achieve greater equality in terms of gender on the Board of Directors. Further  the Election Committee is of the opinion that the proposed Directors have sufficient time to carry out their duties as Directors of the Company. The Election Committee's assessments of the independence of the proposed Board members Taking into account the applicable Swedish rules regarding independence  the Election Committee has made the following assessment of the independence of the proposed Board members in relation to the Company and the Company's management and in relation to the Company's major shareholders: All of the proposed Board members are independent in relation to the Company and theCompany's management.Company's management. All of the proposed Board members except from Johan Sjö and Johan Lilliehöök are independent in relation to the Company's major shareholders. Johan Sjö and Johan Lilliehöök are not independent since they are employees of the Company's largest shareholder  Nordstjernan. The Election Committee's assessment of the proposed directors' fees The Election Committee believes it is important that the directors' fees (including the fees for committee work) amounts to a level that makes it possible to recruit and retain Directors with a high level of competitive competence to the Board of the Company. The Election Committee has interviewed the Chairman of the Board regarding the scope and complexity of the Board's work and compared the Company's directors' fees with the directors' fees in comparable companies listed on Nasdaq Stockholm. In light of this  the Election Committee has concluded that the proposed directors' fees and fees for committee work are reasonable compared with companies of equivalent size and complexity.The Election Committee's proposal for Chairman of the 2024 Annual General Meeting The Election Committee proposes that Göran Näsholm (or in the event that he is unable to participate  an individual appointed by the Election Committee) is elected as Chairman of the Annual General Meeting 2024.

The plan has been in the making since Kyiv’s backers decided to freeze hundreds of billions of euros worth of assets in response to Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022  with EU member states cautious and waiting for legal certainty from the EU’s institutions on their usage.If agreed  the EU scheme would allow the bloc to use windfall profits from immobilised Russian assets currently stuck in the Belgium-based clearing house Euroclear and other European depositories  primarily to finance the joint purchase of weapons for Ukraine.Under the EU’s plan  Euroclear would retain profits made before mid-February as a buffer to cover costs and risks such as potential retaliatory asset seizures in Russia.The first step was an EU deal to mandate Euroclear and other depositories to separately account for profits generated from the cash of Russian assets  and park them in designated accounts. The second step  providing the EU with a framework to use these profits  will likely be agreed next week. EU ambassadors on Wednesday (8 May) are expected to discuss another compromise text on the use of windfall profits from Russian frozen assets  with the clock ticking before a June G7 summit.While the Belgian EU presidency text is ready to be discussed  there have been new requests for changes and amendments that would risk delaying and jeopardising the overall text  people familiar with the discussions said.Several EU member states also raised objections to the fact that proceeds are subject to a 25% tax under existing Belgian fiscal rules.Belgium said it decided to set the fiscal revenues aside and allocate all of it to Ukraine  which is likely to include the Czech initiative to acquire ammunition for Kyiv.Assuming EU ambassadors sign off on the compromise next week  EU finance ministers could rubber stamp the deal at their next gathering on 14 May. This would give Europeans enough time to meet the earlier declared target to start using the proceeds by June before Hungary takes over the EU’s rotating presidency  which some fear could hinder further efforts to support Ukraine in fighting off Russia’s invasion.US-led G7 pushRegardless of the close EU agreement  the United States is likely to press for more ambition in the use of these profits.Washington  joined by Canada and UK Foreign Secretary David Cameron  has backed calls for full confiscation  while Japan  France  Germany  Italy and the EU have remained cautious.Most EU member states have so far rejected the idea of outright confiscation of immobilised Russian assets as they fear it would undermine the euro’s stability or risk Russian legal retaliation against the confiscation.Washington is currently looking into a plan that would allow a group of countries to provide up to $50 billion in assistance to Ukraine  with a major part of the aid being repaid with the windfall profits from frozen Russian assets.The White House plan  first reported by Bloomberg  is being discussed among the G7 with Washington pushing to have an agreement when G7 leaders meet in Italy in June  according to people familiar with the discussions.Timeframes are key to the plan  which would provide Ukraine with the largest possible support quickly  rather than in smaller instalments  they said.Should an agreement be reached  it is expected to put renewed pressure on the EU to drop its objections to utilising the immobilised Russian assets  they added.Some in Brussels and EU capitals say they see Washington’s latest proposal as an attempt by senior Administration officials to deliver more financing for Ukraine before the November US presidential elections.According to some EU officials  it could help mitigate a potential return of former Republican president Donald Trump  under whom further US financial and military support to Ukraine could be in jeopardy.Although G7 statements have made clear the entire group’s intention to make Russia pay war reparations for damages in Ukraine  it is unclear whether Trump would commit to this.[Edited by Chris Powers]Read more with EuractivGeorgian PM lashes out at US  EU as protests against 'foreign agents' law continue Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze strongly rejected on Friday (3 May) criticism from the United States and European Union of a draft ""foreign agents"" law  accusing opponents of the bill of unwilling to engage in a meaningful discussion.

Mithra remains committed to negotiating with prospective buyers to enhance value  acting in the best interest of all stakeholders (see also press release of 29 April 2024 in this respect).The trading of Mithra shares on Euronext Brussels remains suspended pending the on-going negotiations.In addition  Mithra’s senior secured lenders have agreed to provide Mithra with continued funding through the previously announced uncommitted ""accordion facility""  for an amount of EUR 2.5 million  This additional funding creates expected cash runway to fund the business through mid-May  allowing additional time to finalize negotiations in the context of the monetization process. Mithra is currently also in the process of finalizing the draw-down of the remaining EUR 2.5 million under the aforementioned accordion facility  allowing to extend the period during which the negotiations can be finalized until the end of May.Background Information:On 5 March 2024  Mithra announced the launch of a comprehensive monetization process  exploring potential sales of selected assets  notably Estetra SRL  and potentially the entire business. Additionally  Mithra announced the entry into a secured bridge loan facility (“the Facility”) for an amount of up to EUR 13.5 million to be drawn in multiple tranches upon the satisfaction of certain milestones  as well as an uncommitted EUR 5 million ""accordion"" facility (which could be used once the committed amount has been fully drawn and only if the lenders consent). The lenders under the Facility consist of funds managed by Highbridge Capital Management  LLC and funds managed by Whitebox Advisors  LLC.For more information  please contact:Mithra Pharmaceuticals SAAlex Sokolowski  PhDHead of IR & Communicationsinvestorrelations@mithra.com +32 (0)4 349 28 22Frédérique DepraetereCommunications Directorinfo@mithra.com+32 (0)4 349 28 22About MithraMithra Pharmaceuticals SA (Euronext: MITRA) is a Belgian biopharmaceutical company dedicated to transforming women’s health by offering new choices through innovation  with a particular focus on contraception and menopause.

The occupancy rate was up 30 basis points over one year  standing at 96.0% as of March 31  2024.Fueled by this solid operating momentum  net rental income amounted to €253.4 million  up 4.8% on a like-for-like basis  representing a spread of 200 basis points over indexation driven by reversion  higher additional revenues (turnover rents  car park revenues and mall income). In addition  EBITDA grew by 4.4% compared to the first quarter of 2023.Klépierre’s total revenue for the first three months of 2024 amounted to €380.2 million.First-quarter 2024 change in retailer sales by geography compared to 2023(7) Country Change Share in total reported retailer sales France +4.5% 41% Italy +2.3% 24% Scandinavia +3.2% 11% Iberia +7.0% 12% Netherlands/Germany/Central Europe +6.3% 12% TOTAL +4.3% 100%First-quarter 2024 change in retailer sales by segment compared to 2023(7) Segment Change Share in total reported retailer sales Fashion +4.5% 35% Culture  sports & leisure +0.8% 19% Health & beauty +12.2% 16% Food & beverage +5.8% 12% Household equipment -2.0% 10% Other +4.2% 8% TOTAL +4.3% 100%STRONG CAPITAL STRUCTURE CREATING OPTIONALITY TO CAPTURE OPPORTUNITIES AND DRIVE FUTURE GROWTHThanks to its sector-leading capital structure  Klépierre continued to have good access to debt capital markets  issuing a €600-million bond with a maturity of 9.6 years on February 16  2024  with the lowest coupon for a real estate issuer in euros over the last 18 months (3.875%  or 130 basis points spread over the reference rate). With this operation  all significant financing needs are now covered for the next 18 months. Since January 1st  the Group renewed €500 million of existing revolving credit facilities on a five-year basis.Klépierre operates with sector-leading credit metrics:net debt to EBITDA at 7.4x;average maturity debt of 6.4 years; andthe hedging rate(8) stood at 98% for 2024 and 84% for 2025.Its strong capital base coupled with proceeds from disposals of non-core assets (€66 million closed year-to-date)  ranks the Group among the few within the industry to be able to continue to invest in extensions of dominant malls crystallizing high leasing tension  and opportunistically carry out targeted acquisitions to unlock further value.As such  the Maremagnum rooftop (Barcelona  Spain) will be finalized in the first half of 2024  while the extension of Odysseum (Montpellier  France) is ongoing. Yield on costs of these projects reach 13.5% and 9%  respectively.Lastly  Klépierre closed the acquisition of O’Parinor  a 100 000 sq.m. super-regional shopping mall in the Paris region on February 27  2024. With a 25% share in equity and the asset  property and leasing management contracts  this investment is expected to generate a strong double digit levered annual cash return from year one.DISTRIBUTIONThe proposed €1.80 distribution for fiscal year 2023 is split into two installments:An interim cash dividend of €0.90 per share from Klépierre’s tax exempt activities (SIIC) paid on March 26  2024; andThe balance of €0.90 per share to be paid on July 11  2024  comprising: A €0.7983 per share “SIIC” dividend; and A €0.1017 per share distribution of share premiums qualifying as an equity repayment ( 9 ) .OUTLOOK CONFIRMEDThe positive performance of the first quarter confirms the solid momentum observed in 2023. Consequently  the Group is reiterating its 2024 guidance and expects to generate at least a 4% increase in EBITDA(10) and net current cash flow per share of €2.45–€2.50 in 2024.AGENDA July 09  2024July 10  2024 Ex-dividend date for the final dividend paymentRecord date for the final dividend payment July 11  2024July 31  2024 Final dividend paymentFirst-half 2024 earnings (before market opening) INVESTOR RELATIONS CONTACTS MEDIA CONTACTS Paul Logerot  Group Head of IR and Financial Communication+33 (0)7 50 66 05 63 — paul.logerot@klepierre.comHugo Martins  IR Manager+33 (0)7 72 11 63 24 — hugo.martins@klepierre.comTanguy Phelippeau  IR Manager+33 (0)7 72 09 29 57 — tanguy.phelippeau@klepierre.com Hélène Salmon  Group Head of Communication+33 (0)1 40 67 55 16 – helene.salmon@klepierre.comWandrille Clermontel  Taddeo+33 (0)6 33 05 48 50 – teamklepierre@taddeo.frABOUT KLÉPIERREKlépierre is the European leader in shopping malls  combining property development and asset management skills.

Challenges include problems building and maintaining a comprehensive knowledge of varying requirements  the lack of easily accessible  reliable property information  long turnarounds and relatively frequent jurisdictional filing rejections. There are often filing inaccuracies  and higher costs associated with manually processing high volumes.As a result  there is the potential loss of first position on that collateral. “We are excited to be the first in the market to offer residential lenders this innovative  one-step filing solution that addresses these concerns ” says Savkar.Securing the additional layer of protection for fixture-related collateral typically involves filing a UCC-1 (Uniform Commercial Code Financing Statement) with both the state and county. These filings can allow lenders to obtain priority over another entity with an interest in the same property  while mitigating the risk of debtor bankruptcy and loss of equipment. But they require an additional level of property information and varying filing steps at the state and county levels  posing a set of unique challenges for lenders.The iLien ResiFixture service alleviates these challenges  leveraging automation to transform the filing process. Lenders need only provide the essential UCC filing information  while the platform’s logic handles the legal description search and required UCC filing in the appropriate jurisdiction  with Wolters Kluwer experts handling any remaining steps  including rejections. Ultimately  this approach reduces costs  saves time  and mitigates lender risk  all with full transparency.Wolters Kluwer Compliance Solutions is a market leader and trusted provider of risk management and regulatory compliance solutions and services to U.S. banks  credit unions  insurers and securities firms.

Challenges include problems building and maintaining a comprehensive knowledge of varying requirements  the lack of easily accessible  reliable property information  long turnarounds and relatively frequent jurisdictional filing rejections. There are often filing inaccuracies  and higher costs associated with manually processing high volumes.As a result  there is the potential loss of first position on that collateral. “We are excited to be the first in the market to offer residential lenders this innovative  one-step filing solution that addresses these concerns ” says Savkar.Securing the additional layer of protection for fixture-related collateral typically involves filing a UCC-1 (Uniform Commercial Code Financing Statement) with both the state and county. These filings can allow lenders to obtain priority over another entity with an interest in the same property  while mitigating the risk of debtor bankruptcy and loss of equipment. But they require an additional level of property information and varying filing steps at the state and county levels  posing a set of unique challenges for lenders.The iLien ResiFixture service alleviates these challenges  leveraging automation to transform the filing process. Lenders need only provide the essential UCC filing information  while the platform’s logic handles the legal description search and required UCC filing in the appropriate jurisdiction  with Wolters Kluwer experts handling any remaining steps  including rejections. Ultimately  this approach reduces costs  saves time  and mitigates lender risk  all with full transparency.Wolters Kluwer Compliance Solutions is a market leader and trusted provider of risk management and regulatory compliance solutions and services to U.S. banks  credit unions  insurers and securities firms.

Against this backdrop  on 3 November 2023 the Group drew down its RCF lines for an amount of 500 million euros for 6 months.As indicated in the Universal Registration Document (Chapter 2 - Section 2.4.1.2 Management of liquidity risk  covenant breach risk and cross-default risk) which was filed with the AMF on 30 April 2024 under no. D.24-0380  the Group's liquidity is ensured by:the financing structure currently in place  including in particular the syndicated loan for which the early renegotiation of an ""amend & extend"" was finalised in July 2023 (the term tranche of 500 million euros was due to expire in May 2024)  and the drawdown by the Group on 3 November 2023 of its RCF (Revolving Credit Facility) for an amount of 500 million euros for a period of six months  in a context of deteriorated market conditions and access to financing; the €1.5 billion refinancing plan announced on 14 November 2023  which includes a €300 million capital increase and a €1 billion asset disposal plan.The capital increase is scheduled to take place before the end of the third quarter of 2024  on the basis of the resolution passed by the General Meeting of Shareholders on 26 March  subject to the lifting of the conditions precedent mentioned below  while the asset disposals in progress have enabled 25% of the expected target to be covered to date.These factors determine the Group's ability over the next 12 months to honour its financing commitments and comply with its covenant ratios  in particular the financial debt ratios at 30 June 2024 and 31 December 2024  as well as the minimum liquidity required at each RCF renewal date.As indicated in the press release of 28 February 2024  the Group's gross financial debt (excluding IFRS16 debt) stood at €4 532 million at 31 December 2023  of which €545 million matured during 2024 (excluding the drawn RCF  which is available for renewal until May 2026). The Group's net financial debt rose from €3 775 million at 31 December 2022 to €3 854 million at 31 December 2023 (€3 780 million after taking into account the €74 million receivable from Ages & Vie).This change in net debt takes into account:Gross borrowings of €4 532 million at 31 December 2023  compared with €4 508 million at 31 December 2022; A cash position of €678 million at 31 December 2023  compared with €734 million at 31 December 2022.Liquidity risk and the risk of cross-default are described in the Group's Universal Registration Document (Chapter 6 - point 9.2).Update on the Refinancing PlanThe refinancing plan announced on 14 November 2023 was put in place to deal with the liquidity difficulties presented on that occasion and recalled in the press release of 8 February 2024. These risks are described in the notes to the 2023 financial statements  which are available on the company's website www.clariane.com.In this respect  the Company wishes to point out that the capital increase is an essential condition of its plan to strengthen its financial structure  and that if it is not carried out  the Company would have to place itself under a protection regime adapted to the renegotiation of its debt with its creditors.It also notes that the Group's banks and lenders are waiting for the completion of the capital increase before resuming their financing  and that to date it has not been able to secure any corporate or real estate financing  with the exception of a few maturity extensions  in particular from corporate maturities to extensions in secured real estate format. To date  these extensions amount to €55 million  compared with €352 million of debt maturities in the first half.In December 2023  the Company completed the first two phases of the Refinancing Plan announced on 14 November:The completion of the ""Gingko"" real estate partnership for €140 million (press release dated 15 December 2023)  followed by the completion of the ""Juniper"" real estate partnership for €90 million (press release dated 28 December 2023);The arrangement and drawdown of a €200 million term loan with Caisse Régionale de Crédit Agricole Mutuel de Paris et d'Ile de France (CADIF)  LCL and Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank (CACIB). The Group wishes to point out that this loan would become repayable in advance if the proposed capital increase were to be abandoned  unless the Group were to implement an alternative project enabling it to raise equity or quasi-equity financing or financing of a similar nature for a minimum equivalent amount.The situation regarding the capital increase is as follows:The AMF granted Predica  a subsidiary of the Crédit Agricole Assurances Group and Clariane's largest shareholder  an exemption from the obligation to file a draft public offer (in the event that Predica crosses the 30% threshold as a result of the capital increase) on the basis of articles 234-8  234-9 2° and 234-10 of the AMF's General Regulations (AMF decision no. 224C0227 of 8 February 2024).Crédit Agricole Assurances  which holds 24.7% of the share capital and voting rights via Predica  has undertaken to subscribe  subject to the lifting of the Suspensive Conditions and the usual conditions for this type of transaction  (i) on an irreducible basis to the extent of its share in the capital by exercising all the preferential subscription rights that it will receive and (ii) on a reducible basis for a total cash subscription amount equal to the difference between 200 million euros and the amount of its subscription on an irreducible basis  being specified that Predica's commitment to subscribe to the capital increase on a reducible basis may also take the form  in whole or in part  of a guarantee commitment.The Company has also received expressions of interest from banks to underwrite  subject to conditions precedent  all or part of the balance of the capital increase  i.e. up to a maximum of €100 million. At this stage  no agreement has yet been finalised with the banks concerned.The adoption by Clariane shareholders of the resolutions relating to the €300 million capital increase at the Combined General Meeting held on 26 March 2024  a further step towards its completion  scheduled for late June 2024 or September 2024.This capital increase is subject to the lifting of the following conditions precedent  which have not yet been fulfilled:Obtaining authorisation from the relevant competition authorities for Crédit Agricole Assurances to take control of Clariane  in the event that Crédit Agricole Assurances' subscription to the capital increase leads to such a takeover. The Group and the entities involved in the transaction have notified the French Competition Authority of the proposed transaction and requested a waiver of the suspensive effect of the said notification in order to be in a position to complete the capital transaction in June 2024  subject to the lifting of the conditions precedent and market conditions;Obtaining an amendment to the terms of the contract for the issue of OCEANE bonds maturing in 2027 (0.875% - FR0013489739) in order to exclude the possibility of early redemption in the event that Crédit Agricole Assurances crosses the threshold of 40% of Clariane's capital as a result of the capital increase and the possible execution of its guarantee;Submission by the independent expert appointed by the Company's Board of Directors of a fairness opinion confirming the fairness of the terms of the capital increase and the related agreements  including the subscription undertakings;Approval of the Capital Increase prospectus by the Autorité des marchés financiers.Shareholders are reminded that the capital increase provides for the maintenance of their pre-emptive rights and that they may therefore subscribe to this capital increase in order to maintain their shareholding by benefiting from the discount. Otherwise  shareholders who do not wish to exercise their pre-emptive rights will be subject to significant dilution  which may be offset in whole or in part by the sale of their pre-emptive rights.With regard to the asset disposal programme  aimed in particular at refocusing its activities geographically  and amounting to around €1 billion in gross proceeds from disposals  the Group announces that to date it has disposed of :Its 50% stake in a real estate portfolio in the Netherlands to its partner Aedifica for a total contractual sale value of around €25 million;All its activities and assets (opco & propco) in the United Kingdom  to Elevation Healthcare Real estate  a UK investment fund specialising in the retirement and healthcare real estate sector  managed by Elevation Advisors LLP  for a gross sale value of £207 million (around €243 million). The assets sold were part of the ""Juniper"" real estate partnership signed with Predica (press release dated 28 December 2023). Details of this transaction  and in particular the use of the proceeds from the sale  are described in the press release relating to this sale  published on 28 February 2024. It should be noted that the net proceeds from the sale of this business will be used to repay approximately €150 million of the Group's outstanding debt  but will not have a significant impact on leverage.With the sale of its UK business and 6 real estate assets in the Netherlands  announced on 5 February  the Group has already completed more than a quarter of its asset disposal programme in the first quarter. It is actively pursuing the implementation of this programme  with several processes underway  notably in the Benelux countries.On 4 April  the company also confirmed that it had held an information meeting with the members of the employee representative body concerned  in accordance with current French regulations  on the possible sale of its Hospitalisation à Domicile and Services de Soins Infirmiers à Domicile (HAD/SSIAD) business in France. The Group currently owns 8 specialised HAD homes and 3 SSIAD agencies in France  employing 309 people (full-time equivalent). This business generated sales of €46.5 million in 2023. The Group is currently in advanced discussions to sell this business.Important informationThis press release does not constitute  and shall not be deemed to constitute  an offer to the public  an offer to buy or the solicitation of public interest in an offer to the public  nor shall there be any sale of securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer  solicitation or sale would be unlawful absent registration or approval under the securities laws of such state or jurisdiction.

Against this backdrop  on 3 November 2023 the Group drew down its RCF lines for an amount of 500 million euros for 6 months.As indicated in the Universal Registration Document (Chapter 2 - Section 2.4.1.2 Management of liquidity risk  covenant breach risk and cross-default risk) which was filed with the AMF on 30 April 2024 under no.

Renovation of 56 rental homes (72) was completed.A total of 257 rental homes (1   192) are under construction.  The rental housing market is in a waiting mode due to housing allowance changes and a major decline in new construction.President and CEO Antti Aarnio:- Inflation has continued to slow down in Finland and the entire euro area. The European Central Bank is expected to cut key interest rates later this year. The high interest rate level is still keeping consumers in a waiting mode  resulting in a persistently very low number of both old and new homes sold.- During the period under review  SATO’s occupancy rate was 94.9% (95.0). The slight decline is due to the intense competition still prevailing in the market.- Due to the competitive situation  it has not been possible to transfer the higher maintenance and interest costs in full to apartment rents. Going forward  rents may be pushed up by the continuous strong migration boosting demand for housing  the high living costs and the major decline in the volume of new housing construction. Housing allowance changes effective from 1 April 2024 may increase demand for rental apartments with lower rents.- There has been a major decrease in the number of new housing construction commenced in Finland  but there will still be a large number of new apartments completed this year.- In February  the construction of 92 new SATO rental homes in Pataljoonantie  Rykmentinpuisto  Tuusula and the renovation of 56 SATO rental homes in Hämeentie  Kallio  Helsinki  was completed.- In March  we released an extensive upgrade of our digital OmaSATO service where residents can manage housing-related matters online. The revamp aims to make it easier for residents to take care of as many things as possible directly on OmaSATO.- Based on a precontract concluded on 30 November 2020  SATO Corporation and Senate Properties signed the final contract on a property transaction concerning an upcoming block area of residential buildings in the Viikki district of Helsinki on 7 March 2024. The local detailed plan concerning the block area was confirmed on 1 February 2024. Located at Maakaarenkuja 2  the plot has residential building rights for around 300–‍350 new apartments.- In line with our decision made in October 2022  we will still not be launching any construction projects of new apartments.- We at SATO will be investing in clean energy and installing solar power systems in more and more of our home buildings. Solar power systems will be installed in three new properties completed this year  which will contribute towards our target of being carbon neutral in terms of energy used by our properties by the end of 2030. Use of clean energy will also be promoted by adding electric car charging points to our new and newly renovated buildings. At year-end 2023  SATO buildings had more than 1 200 charging points.- SATO was ranked sixth in Finland’s Best Workplaces 2024 listing published by Great Place to Work Finland in March. Being ranked higher than the year before is proof of the sustained efforts made at SATO to develop aspects such as the employee experience and managerial work as well as to promote the wellbeing of employees.- The subscription period of SATO Corporation’s rights offering expired on 14 February 2024. In the offering  a total of 28 279 377 new shares were subscribed for  which corresponds to approximately 99.90% of the new shares offered. The offering generated gross proceeds of around EUR 200 million for the company.- On 28 February  we signed a EUR 150 million sustainability linked loan facility with LGIM. The secured facility has a tenor of 12 years.- On 6 March  SATO Corporation repurchased notes amounting to EUR 50 million of its outstanding EUR 350 million notes due in February 2028.- I would like to thank SATO personnel for an excellent workplace atmosphere and for their contributions to the continuous development of our residents’ comfort and housing.Operating environmentDuring the period under review  the substantial supply of rental housing and the economic uncertainty still remained key factors affecting SATO’s operating environment. Uncertainty is increased by the recession  the worsened employment situation and the tight interest rate policy of the European Central Bank (ECB). Geopolitical challenges  such as the war in Ukraine  global tensions and trade policy decisions and sanctions imposed  affect our operating environment. Headline inflation has continued to decline  but core inflation has still remained above the ECB target. Price increases have slowed  except for services  which are still showing higher prices accelerating inflation.In Finland  economic confidence figures have declined  despite a clear slowdown in inflation. Business confidence has declined in all main industries. The confidence of construction enterprises in particular has declined further  and construction volumes concerning new construction have fallen to the lowest level ever recorded by Statistics Finland  which may lead from the current oversupply to a future housing shortage in growth centres.Consumer confidence in the economy has remained low  and this is reflected in consumer caution. The employment situation has worsened and the number of unemployed persons increased year on year.According to the Bank of Finland interim forecast of 15 March 2024  Finland’s gross domestic product (GDP) will decrease by 0.5% this year. The economy is projected to begin to gradually bounce back from the recession towards the end of the year  with GDP growth at 1.7% expected for 2025.The urbanisation trend continues  and dense urban housing is becoming increasingly popular. There is demand for rental homes in growth centres close to good public transport connections and services. The Helsinki Metropolitan Area (HMA)  Tampere and Turku are large urban regions continuing to enjoy strong growth  while at the same time Statistics Finland forecasts a downturn in the nationwide population trend in 2031. The HMA is projected to grow by more than 200 000 new residents by 2040. Almost 80% of HMA residents already live in households with one to two members  and the number of small households continues to grow. The proportion of immigrants is projected to increase in the HMA from the current 17% to 25% by 2030. The ageing population is moving to growth centres providing access to services and expects more and more housing-related services.The demographic change coupled with the price development create a stable foundation for rental housing demand  especially in the HMA  Tampere and Turku. Migration to large growth centres has continued and the HMA’s migration gain in 2023 was the highest in the 2000s: 23 500 persons. This is reflected in the demand for rental homes in growth centres.The development of wage earners' incomes  pent-up housing demand of households and lower interest rates together with the decrease in new housing production will increase housing demand towards the end of the year. The housing allowance policy changes may  however  steer consumers towards looking for more affordable housing. Some of those looking for an owner-occupied apartment may be considering a rental apartment as a housing option.Rental housing providers are  however  still competing for good tenants  which results in rent revisions remaining moderate. Higher maintenance and finance costs will be reflected in higher rent costs while at the same time the supply of rental housing decreases.REVIEW PERIOD 1 JANUARY–31 MARCH 2024 (1 JANUARY–31 MARCH 2023)Net sales and profitIn January–March 2024  SATO Corporation’s consolidated net sales totalled EUR 74.7 million (70.9).Operating profit was EUR 34.9 million (-17.1).

The number of divested rental apartments was 0 (3).Fair valueThe development of the value of rental apartments is a key factor for SATO. Its housing stock is concentrated in areas and apartment sizes which are expected to be the focus  in the long term  of increasing rental apartment demand. The allocation of building repairs is based on life-cycle plans and repair need specifications.At the end of March  the fair value of investment properties came to a total of EUR 4 914.5 million (5 044.8). The change in the value of investment properties  including investments and divestments during the reporting period  was EUR 28.9 million (0.7).The value of properties funded with ARAVA loans or interest-subsidised loans would be EUR 250 million higher when valuated with the income value method.At the end of March  the commuting zone of the Helsinki Metropolitan Area accounted for around 86.9% and Tampere and Turku together made up around 13.1% of the value of apartments.Investments  divestments and property developmentInvestment activities are used to manage the housing portfolio and prepare the ground for growth. Since 2000  SATO has invested more than EUR 3 billion in non-subsidised rental apartments. SATO acquires and builds entire rental buildings and single rental apartments. Property development allows for new investments in rental apartments in Finland. The rental potential and value of rental apartments owned by SATO are developed through renovation activities.Investments in apartments totalled EUR 12.8 million (46.2). The Helsinki Metropolitan Area represented 96.6% of all investments during the period under review. New apartments accounted for 48.5% of the total. On 31 March 2024  there were binding purchase agreements to a total of EUR 10.2 million (86.2).During the reporting period  0 rental homes (3) were divested. Their total value amounted to EUR 0 million (0.5).The book value of the plot reserve owned at the end of March totalled EUR 62.1 million (48.1). The value of new plots acquired by the end of March totalled EUR 18.4 million (0.0).Permitted building volume for around 1 200 homes is being developed for plots in the company’s housing portfolio. This allows SATO to utilise existing infrastructure  create a denser urban structure and thus bring more customers closer to services and public transport connections.A total of 92 rental homes (135) were completed for SATO. A total of 257 rental homes (1 192) were under construction on 31 March 2024.A total of EUR 5.0 million (7.0) was spent on repairing apartments and improving their quality.PersonnelAt the end of March  the Group had 319 employees (329)  of whom 289 had a permanent employment contract (301).

The main risks of SATO’s business are risks related to the business environment and financial risks.SATO’s most significant risks relate to prolonged inflation and the resulting rise in interest rate level. The war in Ukraine has resulted in a surge in the prices of energy  food  materials and commodities and an elevated interest rate level. Higher living costs may have a negative effect on the purchasing power of consumers as well as on their capacity to perform their obligations. If the strong growth in the cost of financing and maintenance costs continues and the market situation does not provide an opportunity to transfer the higher costs into rents in full  this may have a negative impact on the fair value of investment assets and the company’s ability to perform its obligations or to finance its investments. This means new investments and major renovations may have to be postponed.The highest risks in apartment rental are to do with cyclical movements and changes in supply and demand. The market risk may push the supply of rental homes higher than their demand. This would result in idle rental housing stock and pressure for rents to level off or fall  especially as regards old housing stock.A decline in the housing market may have a negative effect on the market value of SATO’s housing stock. In line with its strategy  SATO has been focusing in its investments on growth centres and on renovating and repairing existing housing stock and  consequently  ensuring the rentability and value development of the apartments.Changes in regulation by the authorities and in legislation and related uncertainty may have a significant impact on the reliability of the investment environment and  consequently  on SATO’s business. SATO monitors and anticipates these changes and calls attention to what it considers to be negative impacts of regulation.The management of financial risks is steered by the Group’s treasury policy. Our risk management principles are defined in the treasury policy adopted by SATO’s Board of Directors. Our most significant financial risks relate to liquidity  refinancing and interest rates. We manage our liquidity and refinancing risks by diversifying the financing sources and maturity of our loan portfolio  and by holding sufficient liquidity reserves in the form of committed credit facilities and other long-term financing commitments. The company has in place an EUR 2.0 billion Euro Medium Term Notes (EMTN) Programme  under which SATO has issued bonds in the total amount of EUR 700 million.The means for managing liquidity risk at SATO include cash assets  a bank account limit  EUR 600 million in committed credit facilities and a EUR 400 million commercial paper programme. We increase the amount of reserves as the funding requirements grow. Our objective is to keep the liquidity requirements of the next 12 months covered by committed agreements.Floating-rate loans represent an interest rate risk which we manage by balancing the share of fixed- and floating-rate loans either by fixed-rate debt arrangements or interest rate derivatives. In accordance with our treasury policy  our aim is for fixed-rate loans  including interest rate derivatives  to account for more than 60% of our debt portfolio. At the end of the review period  the fixed rate portion of the loan portfolio after hedging was 60 3% (68.6) excluding short-term loans.For a broader description of risks and risk management  see the Group’s website and Annual Report for 2023 at www.sato.fi/enOutlookIn the operating environment  SATO’s business activities are mainly affected by consumer confidence  development of purchasing power  rent and price development for apartments  competitive situation and interest rate level.In Finland  economic confidence figures have declined  despite a significant slowdown in inflation. Business confidence has declined in all main industries. The confidence of construction enterprises in particular has declined further  and construction volumes concerning new construction have fallen to the lowest level ever recorded by Statistics Finland  which may lead from the current oversupply to a future housing shortage in growth centres.The Statistics Finland report published in March shows that construction costs in the first months of the year have remained at the same level year on year. In line with the decision made in October 2022  SATO will still refrain from launching any newbuild construction projects.Consumer confidence in the economy has remained low  and this is reflected in consumer caution. The employment situation has worsened and the number of unemployed persons increased year on year.According to the Bank of Finland interim forecast of 15 March 2024  Finland’s gross domestic product (GDP) will decrease by 0.5% this year. The economy is projected to begin to gradually bounce back from the recession towards the end of the year  with GDP growth at 1.7% expected for 2025.Urbanisation  income development  increasing housing needs of households and lower interest rates as well as the decrease in new housing production will increase housing demand from late 2024 onwards. The housing allowance policy changes may steer consumers towards looking for more affordable housing. Some of those looking for an owner-occupied apartment may now also consider a rental apartment as an option.Rental housing providers are competing for good tenants  which results in rent increases remaining moderate. Going forward  higher maintenance and finance costs will be reflected in higher rent costs while at the same time the supply of rental housing decreases.Migration to large growth centres has continued and the HMA’s migration gain in 2023 was the highest in the 2000s: 23 500 persons. This is reflected in the demand for rental homes in growth centres.In line with its majority shareholder’s operating model  SATO Corporation will not publish guidance on its 2024 earnings.

We finalized the Algerian divestment allowing us to focus more on our Core Markets  we rolled out new products and grew volumes by strong double digits in North America  and our cost transformation program has delivered structural savings yet again.

As from 2022  Emerging Markets are reported as assets held for sale and discontinued operations  following the strategic decision to divest these businesses.[2] Emerging Markets and Total Group year-on-year comparison is affected by the divestment of the Mexican business activities as of May 2023. The like-for-like comparison is corrected for the scope reduction.[3] Balance sheet data are compared to start of the period  i.e. March 2024 versus December 2023.Unless otherwise indicated  all comments in this document are on a year-on-year basis and for revenue specifically on a like-for-like (LFL) basis (at constant currencies and scope and excluding hyperinflation effects). Definitions of Alternative Performance Measures (APMs) in this document can be found on page 6.Q1 2024 business review of Core Markets (continuing operations)RevenueRevenue was €460 million  up 4% like for like compared to the first quarter of 2023  driven by 10% higher adult care sales  which more than compensated for stable revenue in baby care and slightly lower sales in feminine care. Including slightly adverse forex effects  total revenue growth was 3% year on year.Volume and mix was up 5% year on year  driven by double-digit growth in selected categories  especially in North America. The strong increase in that region contrasted with continued lower market demand there  and was largely based on new contracts that kicked in during the second half of 2023 and in the first quarter of 2024. Further volume growth in the year will be supported by additional secured contracts. The year-on-year comparison was also supported by the customer destocking in the first quarter of 2023 which depressed order levels at that time.In the European market  demand for baby care products remained soft. Promotional activities by branded players  trying to recover volume losses incurred last year  temporarily tempered the share gains of retail brands. Retail brands continued to outperform stable demand in feminine care  however. And in adult care  where demand continued to grow supported by societal trends  retail brands gained market share. Ontex’s sales volumes in Europe overall reflected these market trends  including double digit growth in selected categories such as adult care  especially in the healthcare channel  and such as baby pants.Prices were down 1% on average compared to last year. While in certain categories  such as healthcare  prices were still slightly higher than in the first quarter of 2023  as these contracts typically have a longer term and are more rigid  on average prices have been coming down sequentially since the second half of 2023  reflecting the raw material price decreases which had started earlier that year.Forex fluctuations had an adverse impact of 1% year on year. The depreciation of the Russian ruble  and to a lesser extent the US and Australian dollar  more than offset the appreciation of the Polish zloty and the British pound.Adjusted EBITDAAdjusted EBITDA was €53 million  up €12 million compared to the first quarter of 2023  and up €6 million versus the last quarter  mainly thanks to relentless focus on delivering on the cost transformation program. The adjusted EBITDA margin rose to 11.5%  up 2.4pp year on year and 1.1pp quarter on quarter.Volume and mix growth had a slight €1 million positive impact on adjusted EBITDA  while the price decrease had a €4 million negative impact.Cost transformation measures resulted in €18 million net savings  leading to a reduction of the operating cost base by 4.8%. Product innovations  manufacturing and supply chain improvements  and especially procurement initiatives were the drivers behind the structural savings.Raw material cost decreases had a €7 million positive impact  reflecting the year-on-year lower price indices for fluff  super-absorbent polymers and non-woven materials compared to the first quarter of 2023. However  compared to the last quarter  raw materials prices have started to increase again. Other operating costs were up by €5 million year on year  largely due to inflation of salaries  energy and distribution costs. SG&A expenditure was up by €6 million  as well on salary inflation  but also including the actualization of variable remuneration in the quarter.Forex fluctuations had a €1 million net positive impact  as the positive effect on cost of the depreciation of the US dollar more than compensated for the negative forex impact on revenue.Q1 2024 financial review of Total GroupP&LOperating profit (of continuing operations) was €34 million  double the €17 million delivered in the first quarter of 2023  thanks to the improved adjusted EBITDA and a low level of restructuring charges  i.e. €1 million  whereas last year €7 million charges were booked in the first quarter. Depreciation was €18 million  largely in line with last year.Discontinued operations  consisting of the Emerging Markets division  generated a revenue of €91 million. The decrease compared to €206 million in the first quarter of 2023  was mainly due to the scope reduction following the divestment of the Mexican business in the second quarter of 2023  and to a smaller extent due to forex effects. On a like-for-like basis  revenue was 1% lower. While the business in the Middle East improved further  in Brazil volume and prices decreased. Forex effects were slightly negative. Adjusted EBITDA came in at €12 million and margin at 12.9%. EBITDA adjustments of less than €1 million were made for divestment-related costs. This brought the operating profit at €11 million  compared to €12 million last year  which still included the contribution from the Mexican business.Total Group revenue thereby was €551 million and adjusted EBITDA €65 million. The scope-adjusted last-twelve-months adjusted EBITDA was €229 million.Cash and balance sheetNet debt for the Total Group was €646 million at the end of March  a €20 million decrease over the quarter. Strong EBITDA offset working capital and capex needs to support business growth  as well as tax and financing cash-out. Capital expenditure remained well below 6% of revenue in the quarter  due to phasing of payments over the year  and is expected to increase in the coming quarters as Ontex is ramping up investments in its transformation and business expansion. The financing cash-out was in line with the previous year and included the semi-annual coupon payment on the fixed rate bond.The leverage ratio decreased further to 2.8x from 3.3x at the start of the year. The strong improvement was mostly driven by the increase in adjusted EBITDA of the Total Group over the last quarters.Early April  Ontex completed the divestment of its Algerian business to Hygianis SPA. The cash proceeds prior to taxes and transaction costs were approximately €25 million  and remain subject to customary post-closing adjustments. On a pro-forma basis  this transaction raises the leverage ratio slightly from 2.8x to 2.9x.DisclaimerThis report may include forward-looking statements.

KEY FIGURES AND PROFILE OF SOCIETE GENERALE 1.1 Recent developments and outlook Update of the pages 18 and 19 of the 2024 Universal Registration Document On the regulatory front  political authorities continue to adapt to the emergence of a new global geopolitical and economic situation. The deteriorating geopolitical context  marked by conflicts in several regions of the world  has forced governments to react and take measures to ensure the resilience of their economies and financial systems. The EU has continued its policy of financial sanctions while developing reflections on its strategic autonomy with two proposals (EU Net Zero Industry Act and EU Critical Raw Materials Act) aimed at responding to the protectionist measures put in place by the United States (notably by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act). The EU has also encouraged investments in infrastructure (Next Generation EU)  energy (REPowerEU) and defence (European Defense Industrial Strategy). The discussions around the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP)  as well as its impact on the ability of European countries to (co-)finance the recovery and the ecological and environmental transitions  are thus the subject of great attention. In France in particular  the Government has succeeded in carrying out its strategic autonomy and productive investment projects by encouraging green and innovative reindustrialization in mid-2023 as well as by proposing ways to strengthen the economic attractiveness of the Paris market at the end of 2023. The economic environment  still marked by high interest rates and persistent  albeit declining  inflation continues to be a concern for regulators in an environment of fiscal tightening. In this context  European banks have faced new measures weighing on their profitability (exceptional tax levies by certain member countries  tightening of the ECB's reserve requirements). In France  parliamentary debates have led to consumerist legislative proposals and commitments by banks whose impacts remain under control (e.g.  usury rates  bank pricing  measures to support the economy and the real estate market)  but which threaten to be rediscussed (e.g.  taxation of market operations or savings). The year 2024 includes important elections in Europe (European elections in June 2024 and the appointment of the Commission six months later)  Asia (Taiwan in January 2024 and India in May 2024)  the United States (presidential election in November 2024)  and the United Kingdom (general elections before January 2025). The definition of the priorities of the various administrations will therefore have to be closely monitored. It is with these important political deadlines approaching that many regulatory projects at the European level are accelerating  with a view to (i) strengthening the prudential  resolution and anti- money laundering framework  (ii) supporting the environmental and digital transitions  (iii) protecting consumers and (iv) developing European capital markets. The CRD6 and CRR3 proposals transposing the Basel Accords into the EU have been agreed between the co-legislators  with a planned entry into force in January 2025. It is unlikely that the Basel standards will be applied in the United States and the United Kingdom on this date and the implementation date of the market risk rules  ""FRTB"" (Fundamental Review of the Trading Book) is expected to be postponed to September 2024. 3Negotiations aimed at strengthening the European framework for the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing were also concluded in H1 2024 with in the adoption of the regulatory framework for the future European Authority (AMLA)  to be established in Frankfurt and operational by 2027-2028.2027-2028. The EC has published its proposal to reform the Crisis Management and Deposit Insurance (CMDI) banking crisis management framework with the aim of extending the European resolution framework to more small and medium-sized banks. These negotiations continue in 2024 and could be concluded in 2025. The wider debate around the finalization of the Banking Union is likely to be revived by the next European Commission.medium-sized banks. These negotiations continue in 2024 and could be concluded in 2025. The wider debate around the finalization of the Banking Union is likely to be revived by the next European Commission. The regulatory framework for sustainability  which is now in the implementation phase  continues to strengthen in 2024.In addition to the climate targets already adopted  the EU taxonomy of sustainable activities has been enriched with several additional targets. Sector-specific initiatives provide elements to support banks' transition trajectory (e.g.  Fit for 55 and Green Deal Industrial Plan for the Net Zero Age   including the above-mentioned NZIAs and CRMAs).ESG risks have been an integral part of the European prudential legislative framework since 2023. At the same time  the Group is preparing for the first publications in 2025 under the Corporate Sustainability Disclosures Directive (CSRD). European banks  such as Societe Generale Group  have also published their first green asset ratio   highlighting the issues of the availability of data related to the taxonomy criteria as well as the method of calculating the banks' alignment ratio.In addition  the negotiations on the European Duty of Vigilance Directive (CS3D) have been concluded in Q1 2024 and require companies to be better responsible for their impacts in terms of human and environmental rights  probably from 2028.While initiatives are multiplying at the international level and in other jurisdictions  the question of how to articulate the European framework with those adopted outside the EU remains more relevant than ever. The aim will be for the EU to confirm its pioneering role and avoid distortions of competition in relation to non-European or unregulated players.In addition to the climate targets already adopted  the EU taxonomy of sustainable activities has been enriched with several additional targets.

The aim will be for the EU to confirm its pioneering role and avoid distortions of competition in relation to non-European or unregulated players. Digital transformation and innovation around financial services  which will be pursued in 2024 and by the next Commission  remain a regulatory priority.The reflections on payments (e.g.  the EPI project and the acceleration of the diffusion of instant payments) were complemented by proposals on open finance : the review of the Payment Services Directive (PSD3)  a new text on the sharing of financial data (Financial Data Access) and the European proposal on a central bank digital currency (digital euro). At the same time  discussions continue on digital identity (e-IDAS)  which could complement the strong authentication of current payment systems and for which banks will be trusted intermediaries for consumers.The December 2023 European agreement to regulate the misuse of AI preserves innovation capabilities while strengthening controls on use cases considered high-risk  including certain aspects of credit decision-making and risk management. The required adaptations will be carried out soon  while closely following developments related to the EU Generative AI Pact.Finally  as the institutional renewal of the EU approaches  in the post-Brexit context and the increase in financing needs induced by the challenges facing the EU  several institutions  both 4European and national  wish to give new impetus to the development of the Capital Markets Union (CMU). Several critical reforms have already been undertaken - and some of them finalized - within the framework of the CMU  with the aim of prioritizing the deepening and integration of European markets and ultimately ensuring European financial autonomy with the reviews of: MIFIR (Markets in Financial Instruments Settlement);The Alternative Management Directive (AIFMD) ;The European Long-Term Investment Funds Regulation (ELTIF);Long-Term Investment Funds Regulation (ELTIF); EMIR  for the establishment of a ""safe  reliable and attractive"" clearing system  ensuring the gradual relocation of part of the clearing of Euro products within the EU;The establishment of a centralized access point for companies' financial and non-financial information (ESAP) non-financial information (ESAP)  The simplification of access regimes to listing on the stock exchange (Listing Act). The co-legislators continue to work on establishing an Investment Strategy for Retail Investors (RIS)  which aims to facilitate savers' access to capital markets. However  the proposal has drawn strong criticism from producers and distributors of financial products  as some of its measures could in practice have many counterproductive effects on European household investment. In addition to the reforms already underway  the European authorities have engaged in intense reflection on the priorities to be given to the next European mandate to ensure  in a context of financing needs and growing geopolitical tensions  the competitiveness and strategic independence of the Union: euro area finance ministers tasked Eurogroup President Paschal Donohoe with making policy recommendations on the future of European capital and financial markets;the Council mandated former Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta to prepare a report by March 2024 on areas where integration into the Single Market is at a standstill and where barriers are hampering cross-border activities  with a focus on limited progress towards the Capital Markets Union;cross-border activities  with a focus on limited progress towards the Capital Markets Union; European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has instructed former Italian ECB and Council President Mario Draghi to prepare a report on the future of European competitiveness by June 2024. The various reflections seem to agree on the need to (i) continue to work towards the harmonization of regulation and supervisory practices in the Union  (ii) integrate the notions of competitiveness  attractiveness and agility more systematically into the European legislative approach  (iii) proactively relaunch the securitization market in Europe and (iv) mobilize European savings for the financing of the economy  via pan-Europeanlong-term savings products  possibly supported by tax incentives. Global economic momentum seems to have bottomed out but there is no significant take off yet. Overall  activity remains weak  still affected by tight monetary policies. The global environment is characterized by the weakness of growth prospects. This takes its roots on the tighter policy mix in developed markets at least for the next two years and the weaker rebound capacity of emerging markets economies. On both sides of the Atlantic  the pace of disinflation and signs of lesser tensions in the labour markets should set the path for first rate cuts in H1 2024. However  the level of interest rates will 5remain expansionary and quantitative tightening is expected to continue in 2024.On the fiscal side  we expect some tightening in the United States  but uncertainty is significant with the upcoming Presidential elections. In the euro area  the reactivation of the fiscal rules will see ongoing tightening of fiscal policy. Corporate and sovereign spreads have rallied and are now back at levels observed before the start of the monetary tightening cycle. Sovereign spreads in the euro area are close to their lowest levels since 2021. Nevertheless  corporate defaults have started to increase in the US and in Europe  while solvency issues of the most fragile emerging markets sovereigns remain. Bond spreads are set to be tested for both credit and euro area sovereign. Credit spreads will see pressure from business failures  while euro area spreads could see some pressure as European fiscal rules come back into full effect. Despite some moderation  higher market volatility cannot be ruled out as recessionary effects start to materialize. Geopolitical risks will likely remain elevated in 2024 with several key elections are due in 2024  in the US  the EU  the UK and India. Environmental issues  both physical and transition  may add volatility to both the inflation and growth outlook  and weigh on already stretched public finances. 1.2 Press release as of 2 April 2024: Societe Generale and AllianceBernstein announce the official launch of Bernstein  a new leader in cash equities & research Societe Generale (EURONEXT: GLE) and AllianceBernstein (NYSE: AB) today announced the official launch of Bernstein  a joint venture creating a leading global cash equities and equity research business.

This trend is due primarily to a decrease in operating profit  the negative impact of financial and exchange-rate results  and a corporate income tax rate of 26.0%  stable compared to the first quarter of 2023.Net earnings per share stood at €1.05  for a decrease of -15.1% from the first quarter of 2023.Free cash flow came to 7.2% of sales over the period at a total of €146.1 million.The ratio of net debt to EBITDA3 stood at 1.2 on March 31  2024.Ongoing acquisitions strategyLegrand is actively implementing its development strategy with  since the beginning of the year  the announcement of the acquisitions of MSS4  a New Zealand-based specialist in cable management (with annual sales of more than €10 million); Enovation5  the Dutch leader in healthcare software in the market for connected health and assisted living (with annual sales of more than €60 million); and Netrack  an Indian specialist in server and network rack manufacturing  notably for datacenters (with annual sales of around €10 million).The Group has today announced a minority stake acquisition in UIOT  one of the leading Chinese players in wireless IoT smart-home solutions with strong innovation capabilities  which will allow Legrand to strengthen its positions in the connected building segment.These acquisitions in the promising areas of datacenters  assisted living and connected solutions further strengthen Legrand Group's leadership in its faster expanding segments.SBTi Net Zero commitment for 20502024 marks an important milestone in the Group's decarbonization trajectory  with SBTi (Science Based Target initiative) validating Legrand’s Net Zero 2050 commitment.This commitment involves reducing the Group's GHG emissions by 90% across its entire value chain by 2050  and neutralizing emissions that cannot be avoided.The Group's 2030 objectives have thus been revised  more demanding  with now:- a 42% reduction in Scopes 1&2 emissions in current data based on 2022 - a 25% reduction in Scope 3 emissions in current data based on 2022  incorporating emissions related to purchased goods and services and the use phase of Group's products.Combined General Meeting of Shareholders on May 29  2024Board of Directors6Jean-Marc Chéry's term of office as director expires this year.

Marc Oursin  Shurgard Chief Executive Officer  commented(1): ''Our company has demonstrated again during Q1 2024 its growth capacity and resilience in all markets. In addition  Shurgard is building its future expansion with a very solid pipeline for the coming years (2024-2026). The roll out of our digitalization across the platform strengthens our operational performance (revenue growth and costs management) with an appreciated customer journey (Google reviews). The April 11 cash offer to Lok'nStore shareholders supported by its board is of course a significant step for Shurgard. I recommend reading the presentation available on our website detailing the rationale and key elements of this potential transaction. The estimated date of closing is July 2024. The environment (political and macro-economics) we are facing is still volatile. However  Shurgard has the capacity to increase its industry leading position as shown by these Q1 figures with the support of its shareholders and employees.'' (¹) Constant Exchange Rate 2FIRST QUARTER 2024 RESULTS PRESS RELEASE Operational update (¹) Compared to the same prior year period  our all store property operating revenue grew by 7.1% in the first quarter of 2024  delivering revenue of €93.4 million  and confirming Shurgard's resilience. This performance was achieved through our expansion  with 13 new stores offering 6.8% additional rentable sqm versus 2023  but also through the robust performance of our same store segment. Same store revenue in 2024 grew by 4.0% compared to the prior year  fuelled by an average in-place rent increase of 4.8%. The Netherlands  the United Kingdom  Germany  and Belgium have performed robustly this quarter. Sweden's performance continues to be hampered by difficult macro conditions and a uniquely competitive environment. In France  first quarter 2024 same store revenue grew by 1.1% compared to the same prior year period. This is attributable to a 1.4% rise in average in-place rent  with stable occupancy at 88.4%;in-place rent  with stable occupancy at 88.4%; The Netherlands continues to perform very well in its same store segment. Revenue increased by 7.1% versus the prior year. Rental rates grew by 6.8% compared to 2023  and average occupancy remained stable at 90.7%;The United Kingdom (London) has shown a strong same store revenue growth of 5.1%  fully driven by an increase in rental rates (+7.4%)  while average occupancy moved to 86.1% (-1.5pp);(-1.5pp); Sweden's same store negative revenue growth deceleration has stopped in the first quarter of 2024;In Germany  we saw the most impressive performance in all our markets  driven by a remarkable increase in rental rates of 9.2% compared to 2023  despite 0.9pp decrease in occupancy (to 89.2%)  achieving 8.6% same store revenue growth versus prior year;Belgium's revenue grew 6.3% versus the prior year  supported by a strong 8.9% increase in rental rates  coupled with high occupancy levels (-0.9pp versus the prior year) at 91.1%;(-0.9pp versus the prior year) at 91.1%; In Denmark (Copenhagen)  rental rates rose by 5.6%  partly offset by a 1.1pp occupancy decline (although occupancy remained high at 90.7%) versus the prior year  resulting in revenue growth of 4.7%  thereby continuing the acceleration in revenue growth compared to prior quarters;Shurgard's overall same store revenue performance was positively impacted by a stronger GBP (+3% or +€0.5 million) partly countered by a weaker SEK (-1% or -€0.1 million) against EUR.

KEY FIGURES AND PROFILE OF SOCIETE GENERALE 1.1 Recent developments and outlook Update of the pages 18 and 19 of the 2024 Universal Registration Document On the regulatory front  political authorities continue to adapt to the emergence of a new global geopolitical and economic situation. The deteriorating geopolitical context  marked by conflicts in several regions of the world  has forced governments to react and take measures to ensure the resilience of their economies and financial systems. The EU has continued its policy of financial sanctions while developing reflections on its strategic autonomy with two proposals (EU Net Zero Industry Act and EU Critical Raw Materials Act) aimed at responding to the protectionist measures put in place by the United States (notably by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act). The EU has also encouraged investments in infrastructure (Next Generation EU)  energy (REPowerEU) and defence (European Defense Industrial Strategy). The discussions around the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP)  as well as its impact on the ability of European countries to (co-)finance the recovery and the ecological and environmental transitions  are thus the subject of great attention. In France in particular  the Government has succeeded in carrying out its strategic autonomy and productive investment projects by encouraging green and innovative reindustrialization in mid-2023 as well as by proposing ways to strengthen the economic attractiveness of the Paris market at the end of 2023. The economic environment  still marked by high interest rates and persistent  albeit declining  inflation continues to be a concern for regulators in an environment of fiscal tightening. In this context  European banks have faced new measures weighing on their profitability (exceptional tax levies by certain member countries  tightening of the ECB's reserve requirements). In France  parliamentary debates have led to consumerist legislative proposals and commitments by banks whose impacts remain under control (e.g.  usury rates  bank pricing  measures to support the economy and the real estate market)  but which threaten to be rediscussed (e.g.  taxation of market operations or savings). The year 2024 includes important elections in Europe (European elections in June 2024 and the appointment of the Commission six months later)  Asia (Taiwan in January 2024 and India in May 2024)  the United States (presidential election in November 2024)  and the United Kingdom (general elections before January 2025). The definition of the priorities of the various administrations will therefore have to be closely monitored. It is with these important political deadlines approaching that many regulatory projects at the European level are accelerating  with a view to (i) strengthening the prudential  resolution and anti- money laundering framework  (ii) supporting the environmental and digital transitions  (iii) protecting consumers and (iv) developing European capital markets. The CRD6 and CRR3 proposals transposing the Basel Accords into the EU have been agreed between the co-legislators  with a planned entry into force in January 2025. It is unlikely that the Basel standards will be applied in the United States and the United Kingdom on this date and the implementation date of the market risk rules  ""FRTB"" (Fundamental Review of the Trading Book) is expected to be postponed to September 2024. 3Negotiations aimed at strengthening the European framework for the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing were also concluded in H1 2024 with in the adoption of the regulatory framework for the future European Authority (AMLA)  to be established in Frankfurt and operational by 2027-2028.2027-2028. The EC has published its proposal to reform the Crisis Management and Deposit Insurance (CMDI) banking crisis management framework with the aim of extending the European resolution framework to more small and medium-sized banks. These negotiations continue in 2024 and could be concluded in 2025. The wider debate around the finalization of the Banking Union is likely to be revived by the next European Commission.medium-sized banks. These negotiations continue in 2024 and could be concluded in 2025. The wider debate around the finalization of the Banking Union is likely to be revived by the next European Commission. The regulatory framework for sustainability  which is now in the implementation phase  continues to strengthen in 2024.In addition to the climate targets already adopted  the EU taxonomy of sustainable activities has been enriched with several additional targets. Sector-specific initiatives provide elements to support banks' transition trajectory (e.g.  Fit for 55 and Green Deal Industrial Plan for the Net Zero Age   including the above-mentioned NZIAs and CRMAs).ESG risks have been an integral part of the European prudential legislative framework since 2023. At the same time  the Group is preparing for the first publications in 2025 under the Corporate Sustainability Disclosures Directive (CSRD). European banks  such as Societe Generale Group  have also published their first green asset ratio   highlighting the issues of the availability of data related to the taxonomy criteria as well as the method of calculating the banks' alignment ratio.In addition  the negotiations on the European Duty of Vigilance Directive (CS3D) have been concluded in Q1 2024 and require companies to be better responsible for their impacts in terms of human and environmental rights  probably from 2028.While initiatives are multiplying at the international level and in other jurisdictions  the question of how to articulate the European framework with those adopted outside the EU remains more relevant than ever. The aim will be for the EU to confirm its pioneering role and avoid distortions of competition in relation to non-European or unregulated players.In addition to the climate targets already adopted  the EU taxonomy of sustainable activities has been enriched with several additional targets.

The aim will be for the EU to confirm its pioneering role and avoid distortions of competition in relation to non-European or unregulated players. Digital transformation and innovation around financial services  which will be pursued in 2024 and by the next Commission  remain a regulatory priority.The reflections on payments (e.g.  the EPI project and the acceleration of the diffusion of instant payments) were complemented by proposals on open finance : the review of the Payment Services Directive (PSD3)  a new text on the sharing of financial data (Financial Data Access) and the European proposal on a central bank digital currency (digital euro). At the same time  discussions continue on digital identity (e-IDAS)  which could complement the strong authentication of current payment systems and for which banks will be trusted intermediaries for consumers.The December 2023 European agreement to regulate the misuse of AI preserves innovation capabilities while strengthening controls on use cases considered high-risk  including certain aspects of credit decision-making and risk management. The required adaptations will be carried out soon  while closely following developments related to the EU Generative AI Pact.Finally  as the institutional renewal of the EU approaches  in the post-Brexit context and the increase in financing needs induced by the challenges facing the EU  several institutions  both 4European and national  wish to give new impetus to the development of the Capital Markets Union (CMU). Several critical reforms have already been undertaken - and some of them finalized - within the framework of the CMU  with the aim of prioritizing the deepening and integration of European markets and ultimately ensuring European financial autonomy with the reviews of: MIFIR (Markets in Financial Instruments Settlement);The Alternative Management Directive (AIFMD) ;The European Long-Term Investment Funds Regulation (ELTIF);Long-Term Investment Funds Regulation (ELTIF); EMIR  for the establishment of a ""safe  reliable and attractive"" clearing system  ensuring the gradual relocation of part of the clearing of Euro products within the EU;The establishment of a centralized access point for companies' financial and non-financial information (ESAP) non-financial information (ESAP)  The simplification of access regimes to listing on the stock exchange (Listing Act). The co-legislators continue to work on establishing an Investment Strategy for Retail Investors (RIS)  which aims to facilitate savers' access to capital markets. However  the proposal has drawn strong criticism from producers and distributors of financial products  as some of its measures could in practice have many counterproductive effects on European household investment. In addition to the reforms already underway  the European authorities have engaged in intense reflection on the priorities to be given to the next European mandate to ensure  in a context of financing needs and growing geopolitical tensions  the competitiveness and strategic independence of the Union: euro area finance ministers tasked Eurogroup President Paschal Donohoe with making policy recommendations on the future of European capital and financial markets;the Council mandated former Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta to prepare a report by March 2024 on areas where integration into the Single Market is at a standstill and where barriers are hampering cross-border activities  with a focus on limited progress towards the Capital Markets Union;cross-border activities  with a focus on limited progress towards the Capital Markets Union; European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has instructed former Italian ECB and Council President Mario Draghi to prepare a report on the future of European competitiveness by June 2024. The various reflections seem to agree on the need to (i) continue to work towards the harmonization of regulation and supervisory practices in the Union  (ii) integrate the notions of competitiveness  attractiveness and agility more systematically into the European legislative approach  (iii) proactively relaunch the securitization market in Europe and (iv) mobilize European savings for the financing of the economy  via pan-Europeanlong-term savings products  possibly supported by tax incentives. Global economic momentum seems to have bottomed out but there is no significant take off yet. Overall  activity remains weak  still affected by tight monetary policies. The global environment is characterized by the weakness of growth prospects. This takes its roots on the tighter policy mix in developed markets at least for the next two years and the weaker rebound capacity of emerging markets economies. On both sides of the Atlantic  the pace of disinflation and signs of lesser tensions in the labour markets should set the path for first rate cuts in H1 2024. However  the level of interest rates will 5remain expansionary and quantitative tightening is expected to continue in 2024.On the fiscal side  we expect some tightening in the United States  but uncertainty is significant with the upcoming Presidential elections. In the euro area  the reactivation of the fiscal rules will see ongoing tightening of fiscal policy. Corporate and sovereign spreads have rallied and are now back at levels observed before the start of the monetary tightening cycle. Sovereign spreads in the euro area are close to their lowest levels since 2021. Nevertheless  corporate defaults have started to increase in the US and in Europe  while solvency issues of the most fragile emerging markets sovereigns remain. Bond spreads are set to be tested for both credit and euro area sovereign. Credit spreads will see pressure from business failures  while euro area spreads could see some pressure as European fiscal rules come back into full effect. Despite some moderation  higher market volatility cannot be ruled out as recessionary effects start to materialize. Geopolitical risks will likely remain elevated in 2024 with several key elections are due in 2024  in the US  the EU  the UK and India. Environmental issues  both physical and transition  may add volatility to both the inflation and growth outlook  and weigh on already stretched public finances. 1.2 Press release as of 2 April 2024: Societe Generale and AllianceBernstein announce the official launch of Bernstein  a new leader in cash equities & research Societe Generale (EURONEXT: GLE) and AllianceBernstein (NYSE: AB) today announced the official launch of Bernstein  a joint venture creating a leading global cash equities and equity research business.

This promising performance reflects the solidity of our business model  as well as our agility and our capacity to swiftly implement our strategic roadmap.Meanwhile  we recorded synergies from the LeasePlan acquisition for the first time in our income statement this quarter. This demonstrates the power of scale and the high potential for value creation for our stakeholders. Thanks to our unrivalled leadership  not only are we buying and selling more efficiently  but we’re also strengthening our competitive edge.Finally  the obtention in March  of regulatory approvals to proceed with the merger and streamlining of our operations is a key milestone  allowing us to accelerate the integration and to deliver further synergies.All this has been achieved thanks to the hard work of our teams  who have demonstrated the utmost team spirit and commitment to this transformational journey.”PROGRESS ON LEASEPLAN INTEGRATIONStreamlining the Group’s organizationAyvens reached a key milestone in its integration journey  with the obtention of the Declaration of No-Objection (DNO) from the European Central Bank and the Dutch National Bank in March 2024. The DNO enables Ayvens to start the merger of legal entities in overlapping countries and to implement the new central and local organization structure and the local IT integration  expected to stretch well into 2025. With the relocation of offices already effective in 5 countries and the new brand now rolled out in 12 countries  Ayvens is laying the foundations for the efficient execution of its roadmap and the generation of costs synergies.Rolling out the most powerful remarketing platform‘Ayvens Carmarket’  which now combines ALD and LeasePlan’s remarketing capabilities in a single state-of-the-art digital application  is the most powerful platform targeting traders and car dealers in Europe. With 93 000 cars sold through the platform in Q1 202411  up from c. 60 000 cars per quarter in 2023  Ayvens Carmarket is instrumental in optimizing and broadening secondary market opportunities. Scale definitely matters in this field: the enhanced catalogue  underpinned by the most innovative functionalities  is one of the largest in Europe  which helped lift the number of bids per vehicle by 31% in Q1 2024  compared to the 2023 monthly average. Thanks to the large geographical footprint  Ayvens exported c. 23 000 vehicles in Q1 2024  thus balancing the trends in each of its core markets.Buying more efficientlySynergies from the LeasePlan acquisition materialized for the first time in Ayvens’ income statement this quarter. While most of the EUR 20 million synergies12 recorded in Q1 2024 came from procurement  other synergy streams such as insurance also contributed  showcasing the power of scale. Ayvens is on track to achieve EUR 120 million P&L pre-tax synergies over the full year 2024.In March 2024  Ayvens and Stellantis signed a framework agreement for the provision of up to 500 000 vehicles across Europe over 3 years. Thanks to this unique and flexible agreement with one of the world’s leading automakers  Ayvens  as #1 global multi-brand and multi-channel car leasing player  ensures more competitive pricing for its clients and enhances its capacity to leverage its new scale and buying power to achieve better value and synergies for all of its stakeholders.Q1 2024 FINANCIAL RESULTSAsset growth driven by sharp increase in vehicle valueEarning assets increased by 12.5% year-on-year13 to EUR 52.7 billion as at 31 March 2024. Growth was primarily driven by inflation on car prices and the transition to EV  which have a higher value than ICE cars.Ayvens’ total fleet increased by +1.1%14 vs. end March 2023  at 3 386 thousand. The slower pace compared to 31 December 2023 reflects Ayvens’ strategy to prioritize sustainable profitability over volume growth and to allocate its resources according to its financial targets.Fleet management contracts decreased by -3.4% vs. March 2023  to reach 686 thousand vehicles as at 31 March 2024.Full-service leasing contracts reached 2 699 thousand vehicles as at end March 2024  up +2.4% year-on-year on a like-for-like basis. Thanks to increased registrations of new cars  the order book continued its normalization from the peak observed at the end of 2022  while remaining at a high level.EV penetration reached 36%15 of new passenger car registrations in Q1 2024 vs. 30% in Q1 2023 and stable vs. the full year 2023. Ayvens’ BEV and PHEV16 penetration stood at 22% and 14% respectively in Q1 2024.Income statement17Q1 2024 Q1 2023 Var.

Non-recurring items were more limited in Q1 2024.Leasing contract and Services marginsTaken together  Leasing contract and Services margins (Total margins) reached EUR 706.6 million in Q1 2024  an increase of +16.0% compared to Q4 2023 and +30.6% compared to Q1 2023 (LeasePlan was not consolidated in Q1 2023).Underlying margins increased by +3.7% in euros compared to Q4 2023  supported by the ongoing measures to defend margins and by synergies from the LeasePlan acquisition  mainly procurement and revenues synergies  for EUR 20 million21. Underlying margins22 stabilized at 522 bps of average earning assets  compared to 515 bps in Q4 2023.Non-recurring items totalled EUR +23.5 million in Q1 2024  a more limited amount than in previous quarters (EUR -49.5 million in Q4 2023 and EUR +192.9 million in Q1 2023):Fleet revaluation and reduction in depreciation costs of EUR +17.6 million vs. EUR +107.1 million in Q4 2023 and EUR +174.4 million in Q1 2023. The impact is limited in Q1 2024  owing to the normalizing used car market;Marked to market (MtM) of derivatives for EUR +9.5 million in Q1 2024 vs. EUR -137.4 million in Q4 2023. The positive variation is driven by the increase in interest rates  partially offset by pull to par. The stock of MtM of derivatives was EUR +87 million as at 31 March 2024.Ayvens holds a book of derivatives whose purpose is to hedge the interest and foreign exchange rates exposure  when the profile of funding cannot be matched with that of the lease contract portfolio. While the Group is economically hedged  there can be accounting mismatches as operating leases do not qualify for hedge accounting under IFRS rules and hence associated derivatives (receiver of floating rates) are fair valued through income statement. MtM of derivatives results from interest rate movements (e.g. as net receiver of floating rate  positive MtM when interest rates rise) and reverses towards the derivative’s maturity (pull to par). The sensitivity of the derivatives portfolio23 to a +10 / -10 bps parallel shift as at 31 March 2024 was stable compared to 31 December 2023  at EUR +10 million/EUR -10 million in the income statement;Hyperinflation in Turkey was EUR -1.7 million vs. EUR -26.5 million in Q4 2023 and EUR +18.5 million in Q1 2023;PPA impact was EUR -1.9 million vs. EUR +7.3 million in Q4 2023.Used car sales resultsAyvens’ Q1 2024 UCS result reached EUR +95.0 million  lower than Q1 2023’s exceptionally high level of EUR +190.5 million but better than the Q4 2023 amount (EUR -3.5 million). 152 thousand cars were sold in Q1 2024  stable vs. Q4 2023. Q1 2024 UCS results were driven by:The normalization of the used car market: Ayvens’ UCS result per unit 24 excluding the negative impacts of reduction in depreciation costs and PPA came in at EUR 1 661 per unit in Q1 2024  down vs. EUR 3 102 per unit in Q1 2023 but stable compared to Q4 2023 (EUR 1 706 per unit). The stability vs. the previous quarter actually results from: i) the continued weakness of the BEV used car market  offset by ii) the strong used car sales results on ICE 25 and PHEV;excluding the negative impacts of reduction in depreciation costs and PPA came in at EUR 1 661 per unit in Q1 2024  down vs. EUR 3 102 per unit in Q1 2023 but stable compared to Q4 2023 (EUR 1 706 per unit). The stability vs. the previous quarter actually results from: i) the continued weakness of the BEV used car market  offset by ii) the strong used car sales results on ICE and PHEV; The negative impact of reduction in depreciation costs in previous quarters: EUR -89.7 million  vs. EUR -42.7 million in Q1 2023 and EUR -191.2 million in Q4 2023;The PPA amortization at EUR -67.3 million vs. EUR -67.0 million in Q4 2023 (none in Q1 2023).Including the negative impact of reduction in depreciation costs in previous quarters and of PPA  UCS result per unit was EUR 626 in Q1 2024 vs. EUR 2 535 per unit in Q1 2023 and EUR -24 per unit in Q4 2023.As at 31 March 2024  the Group’s stock of reduction in depreciation costs yet to be reversed over the coming years was EUR 529.8 million  of which EUR 241.6 million yet to be reversed by the end of 2024  hence having a negative impact on future UCS results.Consequently  Ayvens’ Gross Operating Income (GOI) reached EUR 801.7 million in Q1 2024  up 9.6% vs. Q1 2023 and up by 32.4% vs. Q4 2023  despite the negative impact of reduction in depreciation costs (net of the impact on UCS results) and PPA at EUR -157.0 million on GOI in Q1 2024.Operating expensesIn Q1 2024  Ayvens’ operating expenses amounted to EUR 489.6 million  up from EUR 260.5 million in the same period last year  due to the consolidation of LeasePlan  but down sequentially (-5.3% vs. Q4 2023).Cost to achieve (CTA) accounted for EUR 25.7 million  while rebranding costs were EUR 1.7 million. Excluding these non-recurring items  operating expenses increased by +2.6% vs. Q4 2023 but the Cost/Income ratio excl. UCS result improved to 67.7% (from 68.4% in Q4 2023).Cost of riskImpairment charges on receivables came in at EUR 33.1 million in Q1 2024  compared to EUR 24.4 million in Q4 2023 and the exceptionally low Q1 2023 amount of EUR 8.8 million26. The cost of risk27 stood at 25 bps in Q1 2024 (vs. 19 bps in Q4 2023 and 14 bps in Q1 2023). The rise is primarily driven by LeasePlan’s alignment on the Group’s provisioning methodology.Net incomeNon-recurring result came in at EUR +9.0 million in Q1 2024 vs. EUR -20.6 million in Q1 2023  which was related to the impairment of ALD Russia and ALD Belarus and vs. EUR -14.1 million in Q4 2023  which was driven by a goodwill impairment at Fleetpool  the subscription company in Germany.Income tax expense came in at EUR 90.5 million  down from EUR 125.6 million in Q1 2023  as a result of lower profit before tax  owing to the normalization of the used car market. The effective tax rate increased to 31.3% from 28.4% in Q1 2023  mainly due to non-deductible expenses related to hyperinflation accounting in Turkey.Non-controlling interests were EUR -11.1 million vs. EUR -1.5 million in Q1 2023  due to the consolidation  since 22 May 2023  of LeasePlan  whose AT1 coupon payments to third parties are accounted for as non-controlling interests.Ayvens’ net income group share reached EUR 187.8 million in Q1 2024  compared to EUR 28.2 million in Q4 2023  which was primarily impacted by the negative marked-to-market of derivatives. The decrease of 40.5% vs. the exceptionally high base of EUR 315.5 million in Q1 2023 is mainly due to the normalization of the used car market from exceedingly favourable levels.Diluted Earnings per share28 was EUR 0.20 vs. EUR 0.56 in Q1 2023.The Return on Tangible Equity (ROTE) came in at 9.6% in Q1 2024 vs. 22.5% in Q1 2023.BALANCE SHEET AND REGULATORY CAPITALFinancial structureGroup shareholders’ equity29 totalled EUR 10.3 billion as at 31 March 2024 (vs. EUR 10.1 billion as at 31 December 2023).

The increase was 12.5% year-on-year on a like-for-like basis  underpinned by the continued growth of EV which have a higher value.Financial debt29 stood at EUR 38.6 billion at the end of March 2024 (vs. EUR 37.6 billion at the end of December 2023)  while deposits reached EUR 12.8 billion (EUR 11.8 billion at the end of December 2023). 30% of the financial debt consisted of loans from Societe Generale as at end March 2024.As part of its active liquidity management strategy  Ayvens continued to diversify its funding by issuing EUR-eq 2.7 billion bonds in Q1 2024  of which a EUR 500 million tranche over 7 years and its first CHF issuance (CHF 220 million over 5 years).

Our operating performance improved thanks to a strong contribution from Global Banking and Investor Solutions and solid revenues from International Retail Banking. The rebound of retail banking in France is underway with an increase in the net interest income compared to last quarter  despite an increase in deposit beta in the French market. Similarly  the stabilisation of Ayvens’s margins has already begun  in a context of normalisation of used car sales prices. Costs are under control  in line with the trajectory presented at our Capital Markets Day. Our capital position is stronger. In terms of strategic initiatives  we launched the Bernstein joint venture  creating a new leader in research and cash equity and we announced the planned disposals of Societe Generale Equipment Finance and subsidiaries in Morocco. These first positive results demonstrate the mobilisation of all the teams to shape a more synergetic and efficient model  a source of sustainable profitability.”GROUP CONSOLIDATED RESULTSIn EURm Q1 24 Q1 23 Change Net banking income 6 645 6 671 -0.4% -4.8%* Operating expenses (4 980) (5 057) -1.5% -6.3%* Gross operating income 1 665 1 614 +3.2% +0.0%* Net cost of risk (400) (182) x 2.2 x 2.1* Operating income 1 265 1 432 -11.7% -15.1%* Net profits or losses from other assets (80) (17) n/s n/s Income tax (274) (328) -16.4% -12.2%* Net income 917 1 092 -16.0% -22.8%* O.w. non-controlling interests 237 224 +5.8% -12.8%* Group net income 680 868 -21.7% -25.5%* ROE 3.6% 5.0% ROTE 4.1% 5.7% Cost to income 74.9% 75.8%Asterisks* in the document refer to data at constant perimeter and exchangeSociete Generale’s Board of Directors  which met on 2 May 2024 under the chairmanship of Lorenzo Bini Smaghi  examined the Societe Generale Group’s results for Q1 24.Net banking incomeNet banking income stood at EUR 6.6 billion  globally stable vs. Q1 23 (-0.4%).Revenues of French Retail  Private Banking and Insurance were down by -3.5% vs. Q1 23 at EUR 2.0bn in Q1 24. The net interest income continued to be impacted by short-term hedges (around EUR -0.3 billion) and by the shift from sight deposits to financial savings and interest-bearing deposits which share continues to increase. Assets under management from Private Banking and Insurance strongly increased which contributed to higher financial fees for the pilar by around +10% in Q1 24 vs. same quarter of last year. Lastly  BoursoBank pursues its strong growth with 457k new clients in Q1 24 and a cost of acquisition which still weighs on service fees.Global Banking and Investor Solutions posted a solid performance  with quarterly revenues ofEUR 2.6 billion  down -5.1% relative to a historically high Q1 23 performance. Revenues at Global Markets and Investor Services were down by -8.8% vs. Q1 23 owing notably to Global Markets which posted however very solid revenues at EUR 1.6bn  down by -7.0% compared to a high Q1 23 base. This decline lies with fixed-income activities  down by -17% amid less conducive market conditions than last years  equity activities posting a higher performance by +3% thanks notably to strong results of equity derivatives. The Financing and Advisory business posted solid revenues of EUR 859 million  up by +3.5% in Q1 24 vs. Q1 23  with strong activity in Asset Finance  good commercial momentum in Natural Resources and a rebound in Debt Capital Markets  while volumes remain low in merger and acquisition activities as well as in Equity Capital Markets. Global Transaction & Payment Services’ revenues were up by +7.8% relative to Q1 23  driven by a robust commercial performance and higher margins in Cash Management activities.International Retail  Mobility and Leasing Services’ revenues increased by +3.9% vs. Q1 23. Those of International Retail Banking stood at EUR 1.0 billion  which is stable compared to the Q1 23 performance  on the back of robust commercial activity in both regions. Revenues for the Mobility and Leasing Services businesses grew by +8.1%  mainly due to the EUR 417 million contribution from LeasePlan  while Ayvens’ margins continued to stabilise and the used car sale’s market keeps on normalising.The Corporate Centre recorded revenues of EUR -137 million in Q1 24.Operating expensesOperating expenses came to EUR 4 980 million in Q1 24  down -1.5% vs. Q1 23. The cost-to-income ratio stood at 74.9%  down relative to Q1 23 (75.8%) and Q4 23 (78.3%).They include EUR 254 million for the integration of LeasePlan and EUR 352 million in transformation costs  up EUR +106 million compared to Q1 23  notably due to transformation plan in the French head office  the transformation of Ayvens following the LeasePlan acquisition  as well as the ongoing projects in Global Banking and Investor Solutions. The Group recorded EUR 302 million in IFRIC 21 charges in Q1 24  down by EUR -608 million relative to Q1 23 as a result of the end of the contribution to the Single Resolution Fund. Restated from these items  the operating expenses increased moderately by EUR +171 million in Q1 24 vs. Q1 23 (by ~+3.4%  a level below inflation for the period).Cost of riskThe cost of risk stood at 27 basis points in Q1 24  or EUR 400 million  which is within the guidance of between 25 and 30 basis points for 2024. It breaks down as a EUR 499 million provision for doubtful loans (around 34 basis points) which includes the impact of the entry into defaults of several market-specific files in France and a EUR -99 million reversal of performing loan outstanding (around -7 basis points)  notably related to reversals on the Russian offshore portfolio that is continuing to amortise.The Group’s provisions on performing loans amounted to EUR 3 286 million  down EUR -286 million relative to 31 December 2023  mainly due to the application of IFRS 5 accounting norms for activities under disposal.The gross coverage ratio stood at 2.85%6  at 31 March 2024. The net coverage ratio on the Group’s non-performing loans stood at 82%7 at 31 March 2024 (after netting of guarantees and collateral). At 31 March 2024  the Group again reduced its offshore exposure to Russia to around EUR 0.7 billion of EAD (Exposure at Default)  compared with EUR 0.9 billion at end 2023 (-22%).

It is obtained in two steps:A first step aiming at reclassifying the items of the financial statements into aggregates allowing for a more economic reading of the balance sheet. Main reclassifications:Insurance: grouping of the accounting items related to insurance within a single aggregate in both assets and liabilities.Customer loans: include outstanding loans with customers (net of provisions and write-downs  including net lease financing outstanding and transactions at fair value through profit and loss); excludes financial assets reclassified under loans and receivables in accordance with the conditions stipulated by IFRS 9 (these positions have been reclassified in their original lines).Wholesale funding: Includes interbank liabilities and debt securities issued.Financing transactions have been allocated to medium/long-term resources and short-term resources based on the maturity of outstanding  more or less than one year.Reclassification under customer deposits of the share of issues placed by French Retail Banking networks (recorded in medium/long-term financing)  and certain transactions carried out with counterparties equivalent to customer deposits (previously included in short term financing).Deduction from customer deposits and reintegration into short-term financing of certain transactions equivalent to market resources.A second step aiming at excluding the contribution of insurance subsidiaries  and netting derivatives  repurchase agreements  securities borrowing/lending  accruals and “due to central banks”.The Group loan/deposit ratio is determined as the division of the customer loans by customer deposits as presented in the funded balance sheet.NB (1) The sum of values contained in the tables and analyses may differ slightly from the total reported due to rounding rules.(2) All the information on the results for the period (notably: press release  downloadable data  presentation slides and supplement) is available on Societe Generale’s website www.societegenerale.com in the “Investor” section.Societe GeneraleSociete Generale is a top tier European Bank with more than 126 000 employees serving about 25 million clients in 65 countries across the world.

Our operating performance improved thanks to a strong contribution from Global Banking and Investor Solutions and solid revenues from International Retail Banking. The rebound of retail banking in France is underway with an increase in the net interest income compared to last quarter  despite an increase in deposit beta in the French market. Similarly  the stabilisation of Ayvens’s margins has already begun  in a context of normalisation of used car sales prices. Costs are under control  in line with the trajectory presented at our Capital Markets Day. Our capital position is stronger. In terms of strategic initiatives  we launched the Bernstein joint venture  creating a new leader in research and cash equity and we announced the planned disposals of Societe Generale Equipment Finance and subsidiaries in Morocco.

The net interest income continued to be impacted by short-term hedges (around EUR -0.3 billion) and by the shift from sight deposits to financial savings and interest-bearing deposits which share continues to increase. Assets under management from Private Banking and Insurance strongly increased which contributed to higher financial fees for the pilar by around +10% in Q1 24 vs. same quarter of last year. Lastly  BoursoBank pursues its strong growth with 457k new clients in Q1 24 and a cost of acquisition which still weighs on service fees.Global Banking and Investor Solutions posted a solid performance  with quarterly revenues ofEUR 2.6 billion  down -5.1% relative to a historically high Q1 23 performance. Revenues at Global Markets and Investor Services were down by -8.8% vs. Q1 23 owing notably to Global Markets which posted however very solid revenues at EUR 1.6bn  down by -7.0% compared to a high Q1 23 base. This decline lies with fixed-income activities  down by -17% amid less conducive market conditions than last years  equity activities posting a higher performance by +3% thanks notably to strong results of equity derivatives. The Financing and Advisory business posted solid revenues of EUR 859 million  up by +3.5% in Q1 24 vs. Q1 23  with strong activity in Asset Finance  good commercial momentum in Natural Resources and a rebound in Debt Capital Markets  while volumes remain low in merger and acquisition activities as well as in Equity Capital Markets. Global Transaction & Payment Services’ revenues were up by +7.8% relative to Q1 23  driven by a robust commercial performance and higher margins in Cash Management activities.International Retail  Mobility and Leasing Services’ revenues increased by +3.9% vs. Q1 23. Those of International Retail Banking stood at EUR 1.0 billion  which is stable compared to the Q1 23 performance  on the back of robust commercial activity in both regions. Revenues for the Mobility and Leasing Services businesses grew by +8.1%  mainly due to the EUR 417 million contribution from LeasePlan  while Ayvens’ margins continued to stabilise and the used car sale’s market keeps on normalising.The Corporate Centre recorded revenues of EUR -137 million in Q1 24.Operating expensesOperating expenses came to EUR 4 980 million in Q1 24  down -1.5% vs. Q1 23.

The Group recorded EUR 302 million in IFRIC 21 charges in Q1 24  down by EUR -608 million relative to Q1 23 as a result of the end of the contribution to the Single Resolution Fund. Restated from these items  the operating expenses increased moderately by EUR +171 million in Q1 24 vs. Q1 23 (by ~+3.4%  a level below inflation for the period).Cost of riskThe cost of risk stood at 27 basis points in Q1 24  or EUR 400 million  which is within the guidance of between 25 and 30 basis points for 2024. It breaks down as a EUR 499 million provision for doubtful loans (around 34 basis points) which includes the impact of the entry into defaults of several market-specific files in France and a EUR -99 million reversal of performing loan outstanding (around -7 basis points)  notably related to reversals on the Russian offshore portfolio that is continuing to amortise.The Group’s provisions on performing loans amounted to EUR 3 286 million  down EUR -286 million relative to 31 December 2023  mainly due to the application of IFRS 5 accounting norms for activities under disposal.The gross coverage ratio stood at 2.85%6  at 31 March 2024. The net coverage ratio on the Group’s non-performing loans stood at 82%7 at 31 March 2024 (after netting of guarantees and collateral).

Main reclassifications:Insurance: grouping of the accounting items related to insurance within a single aggregate in both assets and liabilities.Customer loans: include outstanding loans with customers (net of provisions and write-downs  including net lease financing outstanding and transactions at fair value through profit and loss); excludes financial assets reclassified under loans and receivables in accordance with the conditions stipulated by IFRS 9 (these positions have been reclassified in their original lines).Wholesale funding: Includes interbank liabilities and debt securities issued.Financing transactions have been allocated to medium/long-term resources and short-term resources based on the maturity of outstanding  more or less than one year.Reclassification under customer deposits of the share of issues placed by French Retail Banking networks (recorded in medium/long-term financing)  and certain transactions carried out with counterparties equivalent to customer deposits (previously included in short term financing).Deduction from customer deposits and reintegration into short-term financing of certain transactions equivalent to market resources.A second step aiming at excluding the contribution of insurance subsidiaries  and netting derivatives  repurchase agreements  securities borrowing/lending  accruals and “due to central banks”.The Group loan/deposit ratio is determined as the division of the customer loans by customer deposits as presented in the funded balance sheet.NB (1) The sum of values contained in the tables and analyses may differ slightly from the total reported due to rounding rules.(2) All the information on the results for the period (notably: press release  downloadable data  presentation slides and supplement) is available on Societe Generale’s website www.societegenerale.com in the “Investor” section.Societe GeneraleSociete Generale is a top tier European Bank with more than 126 000 employees serving about 25 million clients in 65 countries across the world.
