Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillDublin needs to attract IPOs if its struggling stock exchange is to survive  its chief executive Daryl Byrne told the Business Post.Mr Byrne’s warning comes as Orla O’Gorman  former head of listings at Euronext Dublin  said the exchange was “certainly challenged”  adding that it would be a “brave move” for a company to list in Ireland currently  given the dearth of IPOs over the last five years.A number of high profile companies have either delisted in recent months or are planning to do so  including Paddy Power owner Flutter  CRH and Smurfit Kappa  pending the completion of its US paper and packaging rival WestRock later this year.An industry-wide working group is putting together a report to be submitted to the Government before Budget 2024  outlining the steps that must be taken to secure the future of the exchange.READ MOREEnergy giant settles with fisherman blocking wind farmA German energy giant made a settlement and paid legal costs of about €500 000 to a Co Wicklow fisherman for him to withdraw legal proceedings that were blocking the development of an offshore wind farm.The Sunday Times reports that RWE  which was granted a foreshore licence to survey part of the sea off the east coast  was taken to the High Court last May by Greystones fisherman Ivan Toole.Mr Toole sought a judicial review on environmental grounds of the Minister of State for local government’s decision to grant the licence. His case was then referred to the EU Court of Justice  potentially delaying judgment by up to 12 months.The paper reports that in a first-of-a-kind arrangement within the industry here  RWE settled with Mr Toole and agreed to pay his legal costs in return for him withdrawing his proceedings.‘Binary discussion’ around data centres is unhelpful  says Amazon bossData centres have a crucial role to play in helping to drive investment in renewable energy  the boss of Amazon Web Services’s European boss has told the Business Post  warning that the Republic could lose out on billions of euro in investment if it continues to block new developments.Neil Morris hit out at the “simplistic and binary” nature of the debate around data centres and the drive towards sustainability.“Some parties claim it’s either the environment or the economy. And I don’t accept that. It’s not simply the environment or the economy. It’s the environment and the economy. We have got to do both. And if we don’t successfully do both together  then we’re at risk of doing nothing ” he said.In the meantime  Morris said Ireland must show it is open for business unless it wants tech giants such as Amazon to scale back future investments.Hines set to buy sixth student housing blockAs The Irish Times reported last week  investors are once again looking at Ireland’s student housing market against the backdrop of a chronic shortage of beds and myriad issues around the delivery of new properties.[ Student accommodation: A market plagued by bed shortages  rising rents and 51-week leases ]It is no surprise then that US property player Hines  which operates the Aparto student housing platform here  is set to buy its sixth student block  according to the Sunday Times.The paper reports the investment giant has agreed to pay close to €80 million for a scheme near St Stephen’s Green in Dublin 2 delivered by student housing provider Scape.With just 2 000 purpose-built student beds in the pipeline  industry experts believe the market could heat up again as operators chase scarce investment opportunities.Virgin Media swings to lossThe company behind Virgin Media swung to a €8.8 million loss in 2022  the Sunday Independent reports  largely due to swings in interest and currency rates.Recently filed financial results for the company reveal it lost €25 million on its cross-currency and interest rate derivative contracts  used to protect against increases in the interest rates on its variable rate debts.Revenue was also down slightly at €468.1 million compared with €470 million in 2021  the paper reports  despite growth in mobile and broadband subscriptions.,neutral,0.12,0.56,0.32,negative,0.02,0.24,0.74,True,English,"['Struggling stock exchange', 'Euronext Dublin chief', 'support', 'Dara Mac Dónaill', 'Paddy Power owner Flutter', 'Aparto student housing platform', 'student housing provider Scape', 'sixth student housing block', 'interest rate derivative contracts', 'US property player Hines', 'Greystones fisherman Ivan Toole', 'sixth student block', 'variable rate debts', 'struggling Irish bourse', 'Orla O’Gorman', 'last five years', 'industry-wide working group', 'student housing market', 'Co Wicklow fisherman', 'The Irish Times', 'Sunday Independent reports', 'high profile companies', 'up to 12 months', 'The Sunday Times', '2,000 purpose-built student beds', 'offshore wind farm', 'Amazon Web Services', 'scarce investment opportunities', 'German energy giant', 'struggling stock exchange', 'Student accommodation', 'Mr Toole', 'recent months', 'High Court', 'renewable energy', 'interest rates', 'US paper', 'investment giant', 'chief executive', 'Daryl Byrne', 'Mr Byrne', 'former head', 'brave move', 'Smurfit Kappa', 'rival WestRock', 'READ MORE', 'legal costs', 'east coast', 'judicial review', 'environmental grounds', 'EU Court', 'kind arrangement', 'Binary discussion', 'data centres', 'crucial role', 'new developments', 'binary” nature', 'tech giants', 'chronic shortage', 'myriad issues', 'new properties', 'bed shortages', 'rising rents', '51-week leases', 'St Stephen', 'Virgin Media', 'currency rates', 'financial results', 'broadband subscriptions', 'Business Post', 'Amazon boss', 'European boss', 'legal proceedings', 'foreshore licence', 'local government', 'Neil Morris', 'future investments', 'industry experts', '€8.8 million loss', 'Euronext Dublin', 'IPOs', 'Photograph', 'warning', 'listings', 'company', 'Ireland', 'dearth', 'number', 'CRH', 'completion', 'packaging', 'Budget', 'steps', 'settlement', 'RWE', 'sea', 'Minister', 'State', 'decision', 'case', 'Justice', 'judgment', 'return', 'Republic', 'billions', 'simplistic', 'debate', 'drive', 'sustainability', 'parties', 'economy', 'risk', 'meantime', 'investors', 'backdrop', 'delivery', 'surprise', 'scheme', 'Green', 'pipeline', 'operators', 'swings', 'cross-currency', 'increases', 'Revenue', 'growth', 'mobile']",2024-05-05,2024-05-05,irishtimes.com

September wheat  the most active position on Paris-based Euronext  was up 3.5% at 235.75 euros ($253.90) per metric ton by 1506 GMT  equalling a four-month peak from last Friday. Chicago wheat jumped over 4% in US trading as weather worries and a weaker dollar fuelled gains.“The market has a big focus on Russian weather as we go into the weekend ” a German trader said. “The forecasts for south Russian wheat regions are now very dry for the next week and harvest forecasts are being cut.”Russian consultancy IKAR said on Friday it had cut its forecast for Russia’s 2024 wheat crop to 91 million metric tons from 93 million tons. Weather charts were showing very little rain for southern Russian wheat belts in the coming two weeks  raising the risk of sharper revisions to harvest forecasts as crops enter key yield-determining stages.The price rally was also thought to have limited the volume booked by Algeria in a wheat import tender. The country’s state grains agency OAIC was believed to have made a relatively small purchase of between 240 000 and 300 000 metric tons on Thursday  traders said. Negotiations were said to have continued on Friday but without leading to further purchases.“The market has taken off with the weather issues in Russia  so it makes sense for Algeria to wait now ” another trader said. Estimated prices from the tender suggested Russian and other Black Sea origins were best placed to fill the order  though traders noted the absence of some Russian merchants following recent administrative delays to cargoes in Russia.In France  the condition of soft wheat crops was stable last week  holding at a four-year low  data from farm office FranceAgriMer showed.,neutral,0.01,0.9,0.09,negative,0.03,0.17,0.8,True,English,"['Euronext wheat rallies', 'weather risks', 'focus', 'other Black Sea origins', 'south Russian wheat regions', 'southern Russian wheat belts', 'coming two weeks', 'key yield-determining stages', 'state grains agency', 'recent administrative delays', 'four-year low, data', 'European wheat futures', 'top wheat exporter', 'continuing dry weather', 'wheat import tender', 'soft wheat crops', '91 million metric tons', 'southern Brazil', 'September wheat', 'Chicago wheat', '2024 wheat crop', '93 million tons', 'Russian weather', '300,000 metric tons', 'Russian consultancy', 'Russian merchants', 'weather worries', 'Weather charts', 'weather issues', 'Torrential rains', 'late losses', 'soybean harvests', 'grain markets', 'active position', 'Paris-based Euronext', 'four-month peak', 'US trading', 'weaker dollar', 'big focus', 'next week', 'little rain', 'sharper revisions', 'price rally', 'small purchase', 'Estimated prices', 'farm office', 'German trader', 'last Friday', 'harvest forecasts', 'concern', 'corn', 'traders', '235.75 euros', '1506 GMT', 'gains', 'weekend', 'IKAR', 'risk', 'volume', 'Algeria', 'country', 'OAIC', 'Thursday', 'Negotiations', 'purchases', 'sense', 'order', 'absence', 'cargoes', 'France', 'condition', '240,000']",2024-05-05,2024-05-05,brecorder.com
