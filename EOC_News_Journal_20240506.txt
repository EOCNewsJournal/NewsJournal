40418,Deutsche Boerse,NewsApi.org,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/markets/need-to-attract-hedgers-through-proper-regulations-cmx-ceo-p-s-reddy/article68139926.ece,Need to attract hedgers through proper regulations: CMX CEO P S Reddy,The country’s largest commodities exchange MCX has gone through a roller-coaster ride. Between registering a record high turnover and challenges in switching over to new software  the exchange has come out in flying colours. After waded through the difficult …,Q Why did you not seek another term?I spent five years  and I am already 61. I had an eventful stint including handling Covid pandemic and technology platform development. The exchange embarked on the development of technology platforms during Covid. This is the first time in the world a live exchange shifted both the clearing and trading platform in one go. It was one of the riskiest exercises that we have undertaken because we had no other choice. It is like replacing an engine of the flight when it is flying at 30 000 feet. The other choice was to keep paying the previous vendor whatever they asked for. Having gone through such an arduous route I need some rest. Obviously  that does not mean I am going to sit idle.Q What are your major achievements?When Covid broke out  everything was shut and it was a trying time for all of us. We had put 50 key operations people in the exchange office to run the entire business online. We managed it between March-May 2020. After that  few employees got Covid. Then we dismantled the set-up. People were getting used to making business plans through video conferencing and zoom meetings. Covid was a great learning for us. Then a substantial time was occupied for launching the new platform as the contract was awarded in February 2021  at the beginning of second Covid wave.Q The exchange is still dependent on outside vendors?Internal expertise is there to run the exchange. The entire operations are run on a set of two major modules. TCS proposed a solution of T7  the trading platform run at Deutsche Boerse and BANCS for clearing and settlement. TCS had to marry these two and put up a solution for us. These systems are good  but the integration took more time. The kind of complexity Indian markets have is not there anywhere in the world. In terms of managing client margins or generating peak margin report 7-8 times in a day to make sure clients at that point of time had adequate margins  position limit monitoring across groups among others are the reasons why it took us so much time. In hindsight we can say this and that could have been done better  but during the Covid we could not co-locate the teams. A good amount of TCS team was sitting in Chennai  our team and T7 team was in Mumbai. A lot of videoconferencing was happening  but a lot of understanding gaps were also there.Q What developments do you see in the exchange?The number of hedgers on the exchange is far less compared to the international markets. We are well placed in gold trading  but for the rest of the commodities it is largely taking place in the international market. India should be a price setter as it is the largest producer or consumer of many products. Similarly  the far month contracts are not active and that may be one of the reasons why people are going abroad. Currently companies have to disclose their hedging position in their annual report. Even that is not followed properly. A diktat like that of RBI banning jewellers from hedging gold position abroad will go a long way in bringing other products  such as metals trade in India.Q Is GST an issue for the exchange?Yes. We have made a representation to the Government. In delivery-based contracts  the government has to remove the hassles of GST. Our ask is when goods are lying in the exchange accredited warehouses there is no need for levying GST. When traded on the exchange it is changing hands only on the paper without being put on use. Exchange accredited warehouses should be treated as a bonded warehouse. Exchange will collect the GST and pay the Government when the commodity moves out of the warehouse. We are already collecting and paying almost ₹700 crore of commodity transaction tax and another ₹100 crore stamp duty. Even the GST collection can be handled by the exchanges better. We have multiple delivery centres for metals. Buyers may not be knowing from where they will get the delivery. So  buyers have to register for GST in all these States. In this ecosystem  we have speculators  hedgers and financial players. Not everybody takes delivery. Financial players do need to register for GST. They just play on the spread between near month and far month contracts. Currently  in each delivery settlement cycle  they have to take delivery on the record and pay GST. When they sell it then they have to show the GST credit. This is unnecessary and does not serve any purpose.Q Is MCX working on any new commodities?We are looking at introducing futures on 10-gram gold coins. We are undertaking system tests for these products. We will also launch refined sunflower wash oil and refined cotton wash oil. We have got the approvals. We are designing options on index and will apply to SEBI for approval. We have applied for introducing electricity derivatives and approval is pending with the SEBI.Q Is the SEBI demand for fees based on the value of the contract shrinking your margins?,neutral,0.39,0.59,0.02,mixed,0.21,0.24,0.54,True,English,"['CMX CEO P S Reddy', 'proper regulations', 'hedgers', 'refined sunflower wash oil', 'refined cotton wash oil', 'two major modules', 'peak margin report', 'position limit monitoring', '10-gram gold coins', 'far month contracts', 'commodity transaction tax', '₹100 crore stamp duty', 'multiple delivery centres', 'exchange accredited warehouses', 'second Covid wave', '50 key operations people', 'delivery settlement cycle', 'technology platform development', 'gold position', 'delivery-based contracts', 'near month', 'technology platforms', 'major achievements', 'entire operations', 'annual report', 'gold trading', 'hedging position', 'trading platform', 'new platform', 'five years', 'eventful stint', 'one go', 'riskiest exercises', 'other choice', 'previous vendor', 'arduous route', 'entire business', 'business plans', 'video conferencing', 'zoom meetings', 'great learning', 'outside vendors', 'Internal expertise', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'Indian markets', 'good amount', 'understanding gaps', 'international markets', 'price setter', 'largest producer', 'long way', 'financial players', 'system tests', 'electricity derivatives', 'client margins', 'adequate margins', 'T7 team', 'many products', 'other products', 'first time', 'live exchange', 'trying time', 'exchange office', 'substantial time', 'metals trade', 'bonded warehouse', 'new commodities', 'Covid pandemic', 'GST collection', 'GST credit', 'TCS team', '₹700 crore', 'term', 'world', 'clearing', 'engine', 'flight', '30,000 feet', 'rest', 'everything', 'March-May', 'employees', 'set-up', 'February', 'beginning', 'solution', 'BANCS', 'systems', 'integration', 'kind', 'complexity', 'day', 'clients', 'point', 'groups', 'others', 'reasons', 'hindsight', 'teams', 'Chennai', 'Mumbai', 'lot', 'videoconferencing', 'developments', 'number', 'hedgers', 'place', 'consumer', 'companies', 'diktat', 'RBI', 'jewellers', 'issue', 'representation', 'Government', 'hassles', 'ask', 'goods', 'need', 'hands', 'paper', 'exchanges', 'Buyers', 'States', 'ecosystem', 'speculators', 'everybody', 'spread', 'record', 'purpose', 'MCX', 'futures', 'approvals', 'options', 'index', 'SEBI', 'fees', 'value']",2024-05-05,2024-05-06,thehindubusinessline.com

The markets regulator was very cautious given (that it was) the first time such a migration was happening  but they have been very supportive.""Reddy demits office on 9 May; an internal committee will run MCX until a new CEO is appointed.A scam and a pandemicIn February 2021  MCX awarded Tata Consultancy Services Ltd a contract to implement the new tech platform  christened Project Udaan  by September 2022.TCS pipped the only other shortlisted candidate  the London Stock Exchange Group  a provider of financial infrastructure and data. Other candidates who had tendered expressions of interest to build MCX's new platform included 63 Moons Technologies Ltd and Nasdaq.63 Moons  which was earlier known as Financial Technologies India Ltd  was the founder of MCX. But it had to divest its 26% stake in the bourse in 2014 following a ₹5 600 crore scam in its subsidiary National Spot Exchange Ltd. The Forward Markets Commission  which was then the regulator for the commodity and futures markets in India  declared that 63 Moons was not fit and proper to hold stake in any stock exchange. (The FMC was merged with the Securities and Exchange Board of India in 2015.)63 Moons  however  was also the technology vendor for MCX  which had renegotiated its contract with 63 Moons in 2014 for eight years through September 2022.The new platform  however  was delayed by a year with heavy cost overruns—a total of ₹472 crore  against a normal cost of ₹60 crore annually  which dragged down MCX's FY24 net profit by 44% to ₹83.1 crore.Also read: Why MCX is warming up to a wider pool of FPIsReddy attributed the delay to ""bugs"" that had to be removed before the TCS technology core—an integration of Deutsche Borse Group's T7 trading platform and TCS' BaNCS for delivery  settlement and risk management—could substitute 63 Moons' software.After a series of dry runs eliminated all chinks  the new platform went on stream on 16 October last year. To Reddy's credit  the platform has been stabilised  and MCX reported an aftertax profit of ₹87.9 crore for the January-March period after two quarters of losses.“Each time the project was delayed  the vendor got an upper hand to extract more from us "" said Reddy  recounting the challenges at every postponement in implementing the new technology core. ""Probably  it wouldn't have been so stressful had the previous vendor been more cooperative in terms of the monetary compensation they were asking for; every extension was huge. We had no alternative; we couldn't replace the vendor overnight with any other system.""The pandemic lockdowns during the second wave of Covid-19 also posed a daunting challenge  preventing the colocation of the MCX and TCS teams.“The teams participated through VC (video conferencing)  resulting in understanding gaps arising. As if this were not enough  certain members of our teams left  necessitating appointments of equally competent candidates. This also caused delays in the new platform "" said Reddy. “The lockdown was a pretty complicated process that we went through.""Only scratched the surfaceThe successful migration to the new technology platform saw investors re-rating MCX's stock. In afternoon trading on Monday  the company's shares were trading marginally higher by about 1% at ₹4 055 apiece  up by about 215% from the stock's 52-week low of ₹1 285.05.Asked whether Uday Kotak  whose Kotak Mahindra Bank owns a 15% stake in MCX  was supportive during the challenging period  Reddy said there was ""support"" from shareholder directors. MCX is owned entirely by public shareholders  with Kotak Mahindra Bank being the single-largest shareholder.“All the time they were helping... they understood the problems we were facing and said  'Don't worry  go ahead and you will succeed'.""Investors in the company were also supportive  he said.Reddy recalled a one-on-one call with an executive of a foreign portfolio investor in MCX. According to Reddy  the FPI executive said  “We are not looking at what you're paying to them (63 Moons); we are looking at the future of (the technology). We are standing behind you rock-solid.""Reddy denied any proposal about a potential merger with BSE during the troubled phase or at present.“The technology issue and Covid bogged us down for two-to-three years  which has restricted development of this market. Going forward  there is only upward trajectory for MCX "" said Reddy  who will hang up his boots after 38 years of being associated with the capital markets  including with the Central Depository Services (India) Ltd and BSE. “There is huge potential in commodity derivatives and we have only scratched the surface.""",neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,mixed,0.11,0.29,0.6,True,English,"['tech transition', 'airplane engine', 'MCX', 'TCS', '30,000 ft', 'subsidiary National Spot Exchange Ltd', 'Tata Consultancy Services Ltd', 'largest commodities derivatives exchange', 'The Forward Markets Commission', 'London Stock Exchange Group', 'Financial Technologies India Ltd', 'Deutsche Borse Group', 'foreign portfolio investor', 'Kotak Mahindra Bank', '63 Moons Technologies Ltd', 'heavy cost overruns', 'FY24 net profit', 'other shortlisted candidate', 'new technology core', 'new tech platform', 'outgoing chief executive', 'TCS technology core', 'Padala Subbi Reddy', 'T7 trading platform', 'new technology platform', 'other exchange', 'Multi-Commodity Exchange', 'financial infrastructure', 'The FMC', 'Exchange Board', 'largest shareholder', 'new platform', 'Uday Kotak', 'normal cost', 'aftertax profit', 'technology transition', 'new CEO', 'Other candidates', 'futures markets', 'other system', 'airplane engine', 'managing director', 'five-year term', 'daredevil act', 'rare interview', 'regulatory requirements', 'systemic risk', 'first time', 'internal committee', 'eight years', 'wider pool', ""TCS' BaNCS"", 'risk management', 'dry runs', 'January-March period', 'two quarters', 'upper hand', 'monetary compensation', 'second wave', 'daunting challenge', 'video conferencing', 'competent candidates', 'complicated process', 'afternoon trading', '52-week low', 'challenging period', 'shareholder directors', 'public shareholders', 'one call', 'FPI executive', 'technology vendor', 'markets regulator', 'pandemic lockdowns', 'settlement systems', 'Project Udaan', 'previous vendor', 'successful migration', ""63 Moons' software"", 'FPIs Reddy', 'To Reddy', 'TCS teams', '₹5,600 crore scam', '472 crore', '60 crore', '₹83.1 crore', '87.9 crore', '30,000 feet', 'barrel', 'country', 'something', 'MCX', 'bourse', 'operations', 'Mint', 'task', 'integration', 'clearing', 'office', '9 May', 'February', 'contract', 'September', 'provider', 'data', 'expressions', 'interest', 'Nasdaq', 'founder', '26% stake', 'Securities', 'total', 'delay', 'bugs', 'delivery', 'series', 'chinks', 'stream', '16 October', 'credit', 'losses', 'challenges', 'postponement', 'terms', 'extension', 'alternative', 'Covid-19', 'colocation', 'VC', 'gaps', 'members', 'appointments', 'surface', 'investors', 'Monday', 'company', 'shares', '15% stake', 'support', 'single', 'problems']",2024-05-06,2024-05-06,livemint.com

Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillDublin needs to attract IPOs if its struggling stock exchange is to survive  its chief executive Daryl Byrne told the Business Post.Mr Byrne’s warning comes as Orla O’Gorman  former head of listings at Euronext Dublin  said the exchange was “certainly challenged”  adding that it would be a “brave move” for a company to list in Ireland currently  given the dearth of IPOs over the last five years.A number of high profile companies have either delisted in recent months or are planning to do so  including Paddy Power owner Flutter  CRH and Smurfit Kappa  pending the completion of its US paper and packaging rival WestRock later this year.An industry-wide working group is putting together a report to be submitted to the Government before Budget 2024  outlining the steps that must be taken to secure the future of the exchange.READ MOREEnergy giant settles with fisherman blocking wind farmA German energy giant made a settlement and paid legal costs of about €500 000 to a Co Wicklow fisherman for him to withdraw legal proceedings that were blocking the development of an offshore wind farm.The Sunday Times reports that RWE  which was granted a foreshore licence to survey part of the sea off the east coast  was taken to the High Court last May by Greystones fisherman Ivan Toole.Mr Toole sought a judicial review on environmental grounds of the Minister of State for local government’s decision to grant the licence. His case was then referred to the EU Court of Justice  potentially delaying judgment by up to 12 months.The paper reports that in a first-of-a-kind arrangement within the industry here  RWE settled with Mr Toole and agreed to pay his legal costs in return for him withdrawing his proceedings.‘Binary discussion’ around data centres is unhelpful  says Amazon bossData centres have a crucial role to play in helping to drive investment in renewable energy  the boss of Amazon Web Services’s European boss has told the Business Post  warning that the Republic could lose out on billions of euro in investment if it continues to block new developments.Neil Morris hit out at the “simplistic and binary” nature of the debate around data centres and the drive towards sustainability.“Some parties claim it’s either the environment or the economy. And I don’t accept that. It’s not simply the environment or the economy. It’s the environment and the economy. We have got to do both. And if we don’t successfully do both together  then we’re at risk of doing nothing ” he said.In the meantime  Morris said Ireland must show it is open for business unless it wants tech giants such as Amazon to scale back future investments.Hines set to buy sixth student housing blockAs The Irish Times reported last week  investors are once again looking at Ireland’s student housing market against the backdrop of a chronic shortage of beds and myriad issues around the delivery of new properties.[ Student accommodation: A market plagued by bed shortages  rising rents and 51-week leases ]It is no surprise then that US property player Hines  which operates the Aparto student housing platform here  is set to buy its sixth student block  according to the Sunday Times.The paper reports the investment giant has agreed to pay close to €80 million for a scheme near St Stephen’s Green in Dublin 2 delivered by student housing provider Scape.With just 2 000 purpose-built student beds in the pipeline  industry experts believe the market could heat up again as operators chase scarce investment opportunities.Virgin Media swings to lossThe company behind Virgin Media swung to a €8.8 million loss in 2022  the Sunday Independent reports  largely due to swings in interest and currency rates.Recently filed financial results for the company reveal it lost €25 million on its cross-currency and interest rate derivative contracts  used to protect against increases in the interest rates on its variable rate debts.Revenue was also down slightly at €468.1 million compared with €470 million in 2021  the paper reports  despite growth in mobile and broadband subscriptions.,neutral,0.12,0.56,0.32,negative,0.02,0.24,0.74,True,English,"['Struggling stock exchange', 'Euronext Dublin chief', 'support', 'Dara Mac Dónaill', 'Paddy Power owner Flutter', 'Aparto student housing platform', 'student housing provider Scape', 'sixth student housing block', 'interest rate derivative contracts', 'US property player Hines', 'Greystones fisherman Ivan Toole', 'sixth student block', 'variable rate debts', 'struggling Irish bourse', 'Orla O’Gorman', 'last five years', 'industry-wide working group', 'student housing market', 'Co Wicklow fisherman', 'The Irish Times', 'Sunday Independent reports', 'high profile companies', 'up to 12 months', 'The Sunday Times', '2,000 purpose-built student beds', 'offshore wind farm', 'Amazon Web Services', 'scarce investment opportunities', 'German energy giant', 'struggling stock exchange', 'Student accommodation', 'Mr Toole', 'recent months', 'High Court', 'renewable energy', 'interest rates', 'US paper', 'investment giant', 'chief executive', 'Daryl Byrne', 'Mr Byrne', 'former head', 'brave move', 'Smurfit Kappa', 'rival WestRock', 'READ MORE', 'legal costs', 'east coast', 'judicial review', 'environmental grounds', 'EU Court', 'kind arrangement', 'Binary discussion', 'data centres', 'crucial role', 'new developments', 'binary” nature', 'tech giants', 'chronic shortage', 'myriad issues', 'new properties', 'bed shortages', 'rising rents', '51-week leases', 'St Stephen', 'Virgin Media', 'currency rates', 'financial results', 'broadband subscriptions', 'Business Post', 'Amazon boss', 'European boss', 'legal proceedings', 'foreshore licence', 'local government', 'Neil Morris', 'future investments', 'industry experts', '€8.8 million loss', 'Euronext Dublin', 'IPOs', 'Photograph', 'warning', 'listings', 'company', 'Ireland', 'dearth', 'number', 'CRH', 'completion', 'packaging', 'Budget', 'steps', 'settlement', 'RWE', 'sea', 'Minister', 'State', 'decision', 'case', 'Justice', 'judgment', 'return', 'Republic', 'billions', 'simplistic', 'debate', 'drive', 'sustainability', 'parties', 'economy', 'risk', 'meantime', 'investors', 'backdrop', 'delivery', 'surprise', 'scheme', 'Green', 'pipeline', 'operators', 'swings', 'cross-currency', 'increases', 'Revenue', 'growth', 'mobile']",2024-05-05,2024-05-06,irishtimes.com

Meanwhile the local arm of Dutch tea and coffee firm JDE Peet's is making higher profits from NZ consumers. Photo / Getty ImagesAs coffee and tea prices spiral on global markets  one of the world’s largest manufacturers has revealed a big jump in profit from New Zealand  outperforming most other regions.Jacobs Douwe Egberts  a subsidiary of Dutch giant JDE Peet’s  has reported financial statements from its New Zealand arm  showing a net profit of $19.19 million for the December 2023 year. This is up 40 per cent on the $13.75m reported in 2022.Revenue came to $156.19m  up 13.5 per cent on the previous year’s $137.66m.Based in East Tamaki  Auckland  JDE’s brands sold in New Zealand include Moccona  L’OR  Harris  Pickwick  Ti Ora  Bell Tea  Jed’s Coffee and Hummingbird Coffee.The New Zealand result contrasts with JDE’s worldwide performance  with the multinational’s profit halving from €761 million ($1.35 billion) in 2022 to €364m in 2023 due to a write-off on its Russian business  according to its Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange filings.Adjusted operating profit for 2023 was €1.13b  down 8.1 on a reported basis but up 1.1 per cent organically (due to the company’s effective operations).In Asia-Pacific the company witnessed sales growth of 2.1 per cent  on the back of a 4.9 per cent price increase as volumes fell 2.8 per cent.“Performance was geographically broad based  with notable strong performances in countries such as Malaysia  Thailand and New Zealand ” JDE noted in its full-year result announcement.The results came as coffee and tea prices surged on global markets. Wholesale coffee prices have risen more than 20 per cent since January  after crops were hit by extreme weather in key producing countries  including Vietnam and Brazil.Tea costs jumped 34 per cent in March due to rising industry costs and the Red Sea crisis affecting container ship movements.Prices have also been fuelled by increasing demand from a growing middle class in China and the rest of Asia.London robusta coffee futures  an international benchmark for beans used mostly for instant coffee  hit an all-time high of US$3497 per tonne in March and have remained high.New York Arabica futures  the benchmark for higher-quality beans used at cafes  also reached their highest price in 14 months during December.The profit that coffee and tea distributors can make depends on how much additional costs they can pass on to consumers. Photo / 123rfTim Morris  a director and analyst at Coralis Research in Auckland  said in the prevailing inflationary environment  the profit that coffee and tea distributors could make depended on how much additional costs they could pass on to consumers.“Everyone’s profit in some sense has gone up by the amount of inflation — if they are able to pass on those price increases ” he said.“If the cost of coffee beans goes up  and then your local cafe puts their prices up  then they make more money.”On the demand side  he said the simplest way to look at this segment was that the Chinese used to drink tea. Now they have started eating chocolate and drinking coffee.“The world needs to produce more of those things and the challenge is that the raw materials come out of highly politically unstable countries and constant unrest  and the ability to produce more is restricted.“There are also climatic challenges through the centre of the Earth. So prices for these products are rising.”Both coffee and tea were recession-proof to a large extent because few people stop drinking it altogether  Morris said.“What people do is they shift their patterns of consumption. They may shift from going out for coffee to consuming at home. But both coffee and chocolate are addictive. People don’t give up coffee  they give up other things. It’s a great product to be in.”For the 2023 financial year  Jacobs Douwe Egberts (NZ) paid a dividend to its parent company of $17m and income tax of $7.35m.Bell Tea's warehouse and offices at 305 East Tamaki Rd.
