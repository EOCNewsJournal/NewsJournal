40430,Euroclear,Bing API,https://www.intellinews.com/new-ukraine-funding-deal-gives-eu-members-opt-out-on-military-spending-using-cbr-frozen-funds-324193/,New Ukraine funding deal gives EU members opt out on military spending using CBR frozen funds,Neutral EU member states will be able to opt out of a plan to use profits from Russia’s central bank frozen assets to purchase weapons for Ukraine ,"Neutral EU member states will be able to opt out of a plan to use profits from Russia’s central bank frozen assets to purchase weapons for Ukraine  six EU diplomats told Politico on May 6.The compromise will be presented at a meeting of the EU's 27 ambassadors on May 8  where Belgium  holding the Council presidency  hopes to secure a consensus.The compromise is the latest effort by Brussels to tap into the some €300bn of Central Bank of Russia (CBR) frozen assets to help fund Ukraine’s defence and budgetary needs.The opt-out option will allow member states that oppose military aid to Ukraine  such as Austria  Malta  Cyprus and Ireland  to limit their contribution to humanitarian assistance. This exemption is intended to address the concerns of these non-Nato nations that asked for an exemption from a plan to use EU funds to aid Ukraine. It is also designed to bring pro-Russian EU countries  such as Hungary and Slovakia  on board with a deal.""The European Commission proposed in March to use 90% of the proceeds from Russia’s frozen sovereign assets to buy weapons for Ukraine  while directing the rest to humanitarian aid "" the proposal outlines. Specifically  the plan targets €192bn held by Euroclear  the Belgium-based securities depository.However  the plan remains contentious. Germany  France and Italy  all part of the G7  expressed reservations due to potential legal and financial risks. ""It is feared that these capitals will not support the deal on Wednesday "" one EU diplomat told Politico.The deal is targeting the profits made from the frozen assets  not the principal sum under management. These profits are worth some €3bn a year  and could be given to Ukraine.The EU has scaled back the commission paid to Euroclear following criticism of Belgium's preferential treatment of the financial institution. Euroclear’s commission will be reduced from 3% to 1.5% of the total profits  reports Politico. Euroclear wants to retain the previous profits earned of about €5bn to fund a legal defence against lawsuits that Russia is expected to bring if the profits are effectively confiscated. Euroclear will also retain 10% of future profits as additional protection and can request a further increase if necessary.The Belgian National Bank has the final say in expanding this buffer  but the European Commission has the right to object.Belgium’s decision to impose a 25% corporate tax on Euroclear’s profits  estimated at €1.7bn in 2024  has frustrated several EU countries. Belgian officials insist that the tax revenue will be channelled directly to Ukraine.Pressure is mounting for Belgian leaders to clarify how the funds will be allocated. ""Pressure is growing on senior government figures to publicly explain how the money is being handed over to Ukraine "" noted two EU diplomats.€50bn of bonds backed by frozen assetsIn related news  the G7  led by the US  is discussing giving Ukraine $50bn in funding  secured by the same profits from the CBR’s frozen assets. At the same time  Washington seems to have abandoned its push to confiscate the principal of frozen assets after Europe flatly refused the proposal.One option being discussed is to issue bonds to raise up to €50bn  using the frozen funds as collateral  but that leaves the principle untouched. What would happen if Ukraine defaults on these obligations remains unclear.The size of the issue of bonds will be judged so that the profits from the frozen assets can be used to meet coupon payments  essentially leveraging the frozen funds for a large cash injection for Ukraine immediately  that will not cost the G7 any money  nor oblige them to take on the burden of funding Ukraine.Washington hopes an agreement can be reached at a G7 meeting of leaders in Italy in June.According to Euroclear  in the first quarter  €159bn of Russian frozen assets generated €557mn in net profit. Since 2023  these assets have generated around €3.9bn in revenue and will generate around €5bn yearly.G7 officials privately stated that the full confiscation of Russian assets is no longer being discussed  Politico reports.

Other vocal critics of the EU's military strategy in Ukraine  such as Hungary and Slovakia  also support this caveat  which was first reported by POLITICO in April.The European Commission proposed in March to use 90 percent of the proceeds from Russia’s frozen sovereign assets to buy weapons for Ukraine  while directing the rest to humanitarian aid. The plan applies only to the €192 billion being held by Euroclear  the Belgium-based securities depository.However  the opt-out will not assuage all concerns. EU countries that are also members of the G7 — Germany  France and Italy — are the least enthusiastic about this proposal due to the legal and financial risks  said an EU diplomat who was granted anonymity to speak freely.

According to a new report  KfW is preparing to launch a blockchain-based digital bond.Per the German Electronic Securities Act  known as eWpG  the bank has already issued the first digital bond in the form of a central register security. Treasurer Tim Armbruster has revealed that the bank is taking a step forward to issue a blockchain-based bond to attract as many investors as possible.“We believe that digitalization will be advantageous in terms of increased efficiency and scalability ” he added.The new bond primarily targets institutional investors with the minimum size of the bond  which will be €100 million ($108 million) which is expected to have a maturity date in December 2025.In a complex market  the bank reveals that it is scheduled to hold discussions with European institutional investors. The bank will help these investors familiarize themselves with the products and transactions. Significantly  Union Investment  which has experience with crypto securities  is set to be an anchor investor.Four German financial institutions  DZ Bank  Deutsche Bank  LBBW  and Bankhaus Metzler  will manage the issuance of the bond (acting as joint bookrunners). Cashlink Technologies GmbH  a Frankfurt-based fintech company  will be responsible for tracking ownership of the digital securities on the blockchain (acting as the crypto securities registrar).KfW clarifies that while the bond issuance will be digitized  the bank will continue processing payments through traditional payment systems. Experts speculate that the success of the bond could usher in more opportunities for the bank to digitize other operations.KfW’s issuance of a digital bond echoes a recent move by JPMorgan into the cryptocurrency market. The American multinational finance company has recently moved to issue municipal bonds to investors using blockchain technology. This adoption signifies an increasing recognition of the potential of blockchain technology to revolutionize traditional financial systems.As CNF highlighted  Germany has been at the forefront of crypto adoption in Europe.

It extends JCDecaux’s Transit reach across the whole of Sydney Metropolitan regions into LGAs including the Northern Beaches  the Hills District  Campbelltown  Liverpool  and Camden.JCDecaux will now oversee advertising for a fleet of over 3 200 buses. This expansion builds upon the existing JCDecaux Sydney Buses advertising network  which already reaches ninety percent of Greater Sydney every two weeks*.JCDecaux’s successful bid included a strong focus on data innovation as well as positive impact aligned with the company’s Environmental  Social  and Governance (ESG) strategy and Reconciliation Action Plan. Transit advertising offers brands the opportunity to support sustainability and invest in our cities by delivering revenue that helps finance public transport services. In addition  JCDecaux has created the Low Emissions Bus Network product  allowing advertisers to display across the growing electric bus network. JCDecaux will continue to innovate more sustainable products such as this  so advertisers can actively choose to support the climate transition in transport and advertising.This latest win confirms JCDecaux as the only outdoor advertising operator with a national transit network of coverage across all five major capital cities. This month  JCDecaux was also successful in retaining the Adelaide bus advertising contract after a competitive tender process. The contract  managed by the South Australian Department of Transport & Infrastructure (DIT)  commences immediately for seven years. JCDecaux will continue to provide extensive coverage along the most popular commuter bus routes in both metro and suburban areas of Adelaide  from the CBD to the suburbs  the airport  Adelaide Oval and numerous local shopping precincts.JCDecaux has also successfully renewed its Perth bus advertising contract  in addition to holding the bus contract in Brisbane and the tram and bus contracts in Melbourne.The impending launch of MOVE 2 (the new Australian outdoor advertising audience measurement tool)  combined with all-new access to real-time transit data  will provide advertisers with more detailed audience movement patterns. This enhanced capability will allow advertisers to better understand the reach and impact of their campaigns  as well as optimise targeting strategies to connect with their desired audience segments more effectively.Jean-François Decaux  Chairman of the Executive Board and co-CEO of JCDecaux  said: ""We look forward to continuing our bus advertising partnership with TfNSW  which confirms JCDecaux as market-leaders in Transit advertising across Australia. In an era of digitisation across most outdoor advertising products  bus advertising maintains significant appeal for advertisers through its distinctive blend of broad audience reach  high frequency and visibility  and cost effectiveness. It presents a powerful format for advertisers seeking to build their brand  amplify their message and effectively engage with diverse audiences.

These targets are derived from a cutting-edge CRISPR-based target discovery platform  which consists in a genome-wide screening in a phenotypic cellular assay reflective of GA disease.The preclinical team successfully already confirmed the potential of several of these targets across various relevant in vitro models.

The plant uses the WAGABOX® technology  an innovation developed and patented by Waga Energy  to produce RNG from the gas issued spontaneously by organic landfill waste. This green gas  a renewable substitute to fossil gas  is injected directly into the local distribution network to supply households and businesses of local communities.The WAGABOX® unit can process 370 scfm (600 m3/h) of landfill gas and produce around 85 000 MMBtu (25 GWh) of RNG per year  depending on the concentration of methane in the raw gas. The ramp-up is to take place gradually: for the time being  the unit will replace one of the two cogeneration engines installed on the site to produce heat and electricity; from next year  once the second engine has been shut down  it will process all the gas available and will then be able to supply more than 2 500 households  thereby avoiding the emission of around 3 000 tons of CO2 eq per year into the atmosphere.[1] The new unit will significantly increase the site's energy efficiency and provide local and renewable energy to replace fossil fuels  particularly for transport  industry and urban heating.Created in 1978 by the Ardennes Departmental Council  Arcavi implements the waste management policy of the region and operates the IVEDA site at Éteignières  which can process up to 120 000 tons of waste a year.The project received a €311 260 subsidy from the French Environment and Energy Management Agency (Ademe) as part of the “i-Nov Innovation Competition”  funded by the France 2030 plan  to improve the efficiency of the RNG production unit. The i-Nov Innovation Competition supports innovation projects of start-ups and SMEs with particularly strong potential for the French economy.Marc Wathy  President and Chief Executive Officer of Arcavi: ""Using waste as a resource is a concrete opportunity to develop a green and sustainable energy source for the Ardennes region. We're very excited to be working with our new partner  Waga Energy  to strengthen the site's existing biogas recovery on a long-term basis.""Mathieu Lefebvre  Chief Executive Officer of Waga Energy: “Thanks to the WAGABOX® technology  the IVEDA site at Éteignières has become a RNG producer  supplying the region with green  local and sustainable energy. We're delighted to be working hand in hand with Arcavi to help make the Ardennes region greener.”About ArcaviARCAVI is a mixed economy company committed to the sustainable management of waste in the Ardennes region since its establishment 45 years ago. Founded by the General Council of Ardennes  now known as the Departmental Council  as well as various public investors (the mixed waste treatment syndicate VALODEA  the city of Charleville-Mézières) and private investors (Caisse des Dépôts et de Consignation  Caisse Régionale du Crédit Agricole  and the Chamber of Commerce and Industry)  ARCAVI has always been at the forefront of innovation to meet the new requirements for waste valorization.The company initially managed the Éteignières landfill site  with the support of a comprehensive network of transfer centers  in order to address illegal waste dumping as per the Departmental Council's wishes. It then diversified its activities in recyclable valorization alongside VALODEA for the management of sorting centers since 2000  and by creating the multi-process site of Chalandry Elaire in 2005. In 2023  ARCAVI also established a methanization unit in partnership with local farmers  VALODEA  the town hall of CHALANDRY-ELAIRE  and ENERGIC.ARCAVI has been a pioneer in renewable energy production by harnessing the biogas contained in the waste storage cells. ARCAVI's efforts were recognized when the municipality of Éteignières received the national renewable energy league award in 2012  in recognition of the innovative processes implemented.Waste holds a promising future  becoming a locally usable source of renewable energy.About Waga EnergyWaga Energy (EPA: WAGA) produces competitively priced Renewable Natural Gas (also known as “biomethane”) by upgrading landfill gas using a patented purification technology called WAGABOX®.

The Company’s ambition is to make Aeson® the first alternative to a heart transplant  and thus provide a therapeutic solution to people suffering from end-stage biventricular heart failure  who are facing a well-known shortfall in available human grafts. The world’s first physiological artificial heart that is highly hemocompatible  pulsatile and self-regulated  Aeson® could save  every year  the lives of thousands of patients waiting for a heart transplant. The device offers patients quality of life and mobility thanks to its ergonomic and portable external power supply system that is continuously connected to the implanted prosthesis. Aeson® is commercially available as a bridge to transplant in the European Union and other countries that recognize CE marking. Aeson® is also currently being assessed within the framework of an Early Feasibility Study (EFS) in the United States. Founded in 2008  CARMAT is based in the Paris region  with its head offices located in Vélizy-Villacoublay and its production site in Bois-d’Arcy.

The chairman of the meeting thanked for the appointment and stated that Topdanmark's general meeting is held as an entirely virtual general meeting under the company's articles of association. The chairman of the meeting then gave a statement of the practical procedures to be observed in an entirely virtual general meeting  including that shareholders having confirmed attendance at the general meeting and wanting to par- ticipate  including speaking by asking questions  writing statements and voting  must log on via the general meeting portal at Euronext Securities  andthat questions and statements must be submitted in writing through the general meeting portal  after which they will be read out by the chairman in the relevant item of the agenda and answered by either the CEO  CFO or the chairman  in that related subjects or ques- tions may be answered collectively if that is deemed appropriate.

The chairman then stated that  as in the previous years  the general meeting is transmitted directly at Topdanmark's website. The transmission is stored at Topdanmark's website. For information about personal data law consequences  the chairman referred to ""Information about personal data law matters""  which has been presented before the annual general meeting at Topdanmark's web- site. The chairman stated that the notice convening the general meeting with a specification of an agenda took place in compliance with article 13 of the articles of association and the legislation. A company announcement on the agenda was published on 22 March 2024. On the same date  the notice convening the general meeting was published through the Danish Business Authority's IT399 system. It was made available on the company's website  and a letter convening the general meeting was sent by email with information about time and registration for the virtual general meeting to the shareholders having given their email addresses to Topdanmark. The chairman of the meeting stated that the shareholders who have registered for the general meeting  have received a confirmation via email with a link to the general meeting portal and information about the holding of the virtual general meeting and contact information with Euronext Securities for technical support before and during the general meeting. The shareholders have been invited to send any submissions and questions before the general meeting. Submissions and questions received will be read out and answered under the relevant items on the agenda. The past three weeks before the annual general meeting  the annual report  the remuneration re- port  the notice convening the general meeting  information about the total number of shares and voting rights on the date of the notice  the documents to be presented at the annual general meet- ing  agenda and the full proposals as well as the forms that must be used in case of voting by proxy or by letter have been available at the company's website.

Item I. Report on the company's activities in the past year Item II. Presentation of the audited annual report signed by the board of directors and the executive board The chairman of the meeting stated that items I and II of the agenda be transacted as one item. There were no objections. The chairman of the board of directors and CEO  Peter Hermann  reported on the company's activities in the past year. The report is enclosed to the minutes of meeting as appendix 130. The annual report  which was signed by the board of directors and the executive board  was pre- sented. The chairman of the meeting pointed out that the annual report has obtained an unqualified auditor's report from both the internal and external auditors. The annual report is enclosed to the minutes of meeting as appendix 131. The chairman of the meeting stated that the company had already received submissions and questions from the shareholder Dansk Aktionærforening (Danish Shareholders Association). The chairman of the meeting read out the statement: ""The Danish Shareholders Association is an association for private investors in Denmark. We have approx. 18 000 members. We recommend our members to invest for the long term  as we believe it serves in the best interest of the members. Since 2024  the association has had a so-called fundamental model portfolio for which asset manager  Thorleif Jackson  has selected 10-12 Danish industry winners among the large  listed growth companies according to the companies' key fig- ures. Over 20 years  the portfolio has yielded an exceptional high average annual return of 19% before tax. For 16 out of 20 years  Topdanmark has been a constant part of the portfolio. We consider this to be a seal of approval of Topdanmark as a company and of the Topdanmark share. In the shareholder association  we are disappointed that you  once again  has decided to maintain the annual general meeting as a virtual event. It was a necessity during the COVID-19 pandemic 401 but today - after COVID-19 - the way to go must be a hybrid general meeting. We hope that you will reconsider. When reading the Annual Results for 2023 and the statement from management  you get the impression of a disappointment because the result is below the initial forecast. This may be under- standable  however  unnecessary - because  at the same time  you provide us with three good reasons for the lower result: Increased expenses for weather-related claimsweather-related claims Increased number of large-scale claims  andlarge-scale claims  and Higher frequency of motor claims In addition  you highlight significant deviations from the modelled forecast. This leads me to my first question. Question 1: Are the significant deviations from the modelled forecast due to your models becoming unrealistic and in need of a revisit? Or is it ""just"" a matter of normal and expected statistical coincidence? I am thinking whether climate change has been correctly and sufficiently included in the models for weather  whether changes to the combination of the portfolio's risks can explain the deviation for large-scale claims  whether an increased number of motor vehicles has caused traffic intensity to be so high that the claims frequency just keeps increasing  whether the rapid growth in electric cars perhaps can explain the higher claims frequency in motor because electric cars have greater accelerating power than cars with internal combustion engines  and whether it is possible that there is a connection to the change in bancassurance partner from Danske Bank to Nordea. As a postscript to management's disappointment in the 2023 Annual Report  I can mention that your result for the first quarter this year in every way lives up to Topdanmark's historic performance as an industry winner  and there is absolutely no reason to be disappointed - on the contrary. We have previously heard that there are great opportunities for cross-selling for a company that offers both non-life and life insurances. Last year  the shareholders were promised a large dividend because the life company had been sold in 2022. Shortly after the announcement - and before the general meeting - you successfully acquired Oona Health and the dividend was thus reduced. It402 was with great pleasure as it was an acquisition that expanded the product portfolio and with expected better opportunities for cross-selling. This leads me to my second question: Question 2: In practice  how is it going in terms of cross-selling? Have you lost business due to the divestment of Liv? Do the opportunities for cross-selling with Oona Health live up to expectations  or is it too early to say?"" The two questions from DAF were answered by the company's CFO and CEO: Question 1: Are the significant deviations from the modelled forecast due to your models becoming unrealistic and in need of a revisit? Or is it ""just"" a matter of normal and expected statistical coincidence? CFO  Lars Kufall Beck answered the question and remarked that 2023 indeed was affected by a high level of weather-related claims. However  it was not the level of gross claims that was abnormal - Actually  it is to be expected to happen every 7th or 8th year on average. What was highly unusual was that the nature of the individual weather events was in such a way that we basically did not get any compensation from our reinsurance cover. Naturally  we continuously monitor and trace the development of the weather  and we have increased the normal level of weather-related claims by DKK 30m in 2023  i.a. in consequence of more expensive reinsurance due to more extreme weather on a global scale. At present  we are comfortable with the updated modelled normal level. We also agree with Mr. Ander Nørskov that if you look past this volatility in weather-related claims and large-scale claims in 2023 and normalise it  our combined ration in 2023 would have been 82.7 which is quite satisfactory. The frequency of motor claims has indeed increased considerably compared to the COVID-19 period  but is in principle only ""slightly"" higher than before COVID  and it follows the long-term rate of increase. The causes for this are difficult to determine  but it could relate to more cars in general and potentially inattention. Naturally  we are in the process of adjusting our prices to take the frequence into consideration. Question 2: In practice  how is it going in terms of cross-selling? Have you lost business due to the divestment of Liv? Do the opportunities for cross-selling with Oona Health live up to expectations  or is it too early to say?403 CEO  Peter Hermann answered the question and remarked that it is an advantage that with the acquisition of Oona Health we also have access to health solutions which several of our other competitors also have  and thus we can meet our customers' wants and needs for such health so- lutions. The cross-selling of Oona Health's products to Topdanmark's existing customers started Mid-March this year and is off to a good start. The top line synergies of the Oona case are to some extent based on our ability to accelerate Oona's sales to private customers with our customer base and distribution set-up. Therefore  it is satisfactory that we in the last half of March were able to sell more private health products this way than Oona did on their own account in the first 2 ½ months of the quarter. Having said that  it is still too early to conclude whether the possibility of cross- selling lives up to expectations in the long term. In connection with the divestment of Liv  we entered into a distribution agreement with Nordea on life and pension products as a counterpart to our existing distribution agreement on nonlife insurance products. Our partnership has created and continues to create good value for both parties. So  we do not believe that we have lost business as a consequence of our divestment of Liv. No further questions or comments had been received  and the chairman of the meeting ascertained that the report had been adopted. Item III. Approval of the annual report and decision on the appropriation of profits according to the approved annual report The chairman of the meeting stated that the result after tax was DKK 1 051 million. The board of directors recommended that DKK 1 035 million  corresponding to DKK 11.5 per issued share  be distributed as dividend for 2023  which corresponds to a pay-out ratio of 98.4. The chairman of the meeting ascertained that the annual report and the recommendation of the board of directors on dividend had been adopted by 65 312 719 votes  corresponding to 99.96% of the voting capital present  for and 1 183 votes  corresponding to 0.00% of the voting capital pre- sent  against. Item IV. Presentation of the remuneration report for indicative voting The chairman of the meeting stated that the company has prepared a remuneration report covering the financial year 2023. The remuneration report is accessible at the company's website. The remuneration report has been prepared in compliance with applicable rules and is presented to the404 annual general meeting for an indicative vote. That the vote is indicative means that if the shareholders do not approve the remuneration report  the company must explain in the remuneration report for the financial year 2024 how subsequently this result has been taken into account. The board of directors stated that the remuneration report has been prepared for the purpose of ensuring further transparency in relation to the remuneration report and for the purpose of complying with applicable rules in the Danish Companies Act. The remuneration report comprises paid or awarded remuneration for the company's board of directors and executive management for the financial year 2023. The board of directors proposed that the general meeting approves the remuneration report for 2023 in the indicative vote. No questions or comments were received  and the chairman of the meeting ascertained that the remuneration report had been adopted by 64 438 251 votes  corresponding to 98.62% of the voting capital present  for and 885 535 votes  corresponding to 1.36% of the voting capital present  against. Item V. Proposals from the board of directors or shareholders Proposals from the Board of Directors: Item VA. Proposal for an indemnification scheme for members of the Board of DirectorsThe Board of Directors proposed that the annual general meeting adopts an updated indemnifica- tion scheme for members of the board of directors. With the approval of the remuneration policy at the annual general meeting in 2021  an indemnification scheme for Topdanmark's management was adopted. The indemnification scheme covers any liability and claims that may be or will be made against them personally as a result of their duties as board members for Topdanmark in the event of inadequacy of Topdanmark's general directors and officers liability insurance (D&O insurance) in force at any time. In consequence of the informative statement of the Danish Business Authority of 13 April 2023 on indemnification of management members  and in order to increase transparency on the principal terms and conditions of the indemnification scheme  the Board of Directors propose to the Annual General Meeting to adopt an updated indemnification scheme for members of the board of direc-405 tors on the following terms and conditions as the indemnification scheme is not assessed to involve exception conditions. Foundation and purpose Topdanmark takes out general D&O insurance to cover concrete personal liability that current or former members of the company's board of directors may be incurred as a result of their duties. In consequence of increased risk exposure for management  it is necessary to offer additional cover for potential management liability to be able to attract and retain qualified board members. Thus  it has been assessed to be in the best interest of the company and its shareholders that the board members  in addition to the D&O insurance described below  are offered indemnification for claims raised by a third party. People covered The Indemnification Scheme should solely be of benefit to board members and cover indemnification for claims raised by a third party against board members performing their duties. No third party should be entitled to invoke or benefit from The Indemnification Scheme or claim indemnity from the company based on The Indemnification Scheme. Scope Under The Indemnification Scheme  the company should to the greatest extent possible under present law indemnify a board member for any loss that the board member has incurred and which is a result of any actual or potential claim made by a third party (other than companies of the Topdanmark group) against a board member based on the board member's performance of duties. This includes expenses  costs  fees  remuneration  interests and any tax-related obligations incidental herewith. The indemnification of board members under The Indemnification Scheme is not subject to cover under the D&O insurance  but it should be secondary in relation to the D&O insurance in force at any time as well as any other indemnification if relevant. Thus  The Indemnification Scheme can also cover claims which is not fully or partly covered by the D&O insurance in force at any time. However  the company should not provide cover under The Indemnification Scheme before cover under the D&O insurance or other available indemnification has been exhausted. Such secondary cover does not entail an obligation for the company to exhaust every possibility for board members to be exonerated. Likewise  it must not prevent the company from covering board members' legal costs in relation to potential management liability.",neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,mixed,0.31,0.38,0.31,True,English,"['Topdanmark A/S', 'Summary', 'AGM', 'KB', 'lawyer John Korsø Jensen', 'personal data law consequences', 'personal data law matters', 'annual general meet- ing', 'Danish Business Authority', 'Danish Companies Act', 'practical user guide', 'annual general meeting', 'virtual general meeting', 'general meeting portal', 'annual report', 'practical procedures', 'DK-2750 Ballerup', 'Ricard Wennerklint', 'Euronext Securities', 'relevant item', 'related subjects', 'ques- tions', 'technical problems', 'previous years', 'web- site', 'technical support', 'past three', 'total number', 'financial calendar', 'absentee vote', 'full account', 'required majority', 'postal votes', 'same date', 'voting rights', 'voting capital', 'email addresses', 'full proposals', 'contact information', 'Topdanmark A/S', 'company announcement', 'proxy forms', 'May', 'Summary', 'April', 'Borupvang', 'Denmark', 'Tel', 'CVR', '398 Year', 'chairman', 'board', 'directors', 'article', 'association', 'appointment', 'statement', 'shareholders', 'attendance', 'questions', 'writing', 'agenda', 'CEO', 'CFO', 'website', 'transmission', 'notice', 'specification', 'place', 'compliance', 'legislation', '22 March', '399 system', 'letter', 'time', 'registration', 'confirmation', 'link', 'holding', 'submissions', 'remuneration', 'shares', 'documents', 'case', 'section', 'six', 'advance', 'results', 'auditors', 'presence', 'proxies', '13']",2024-05-06,2024-05-07,marketscreener.com

Our credit insurance revenues were affected by the decline in inflation and sluggish client activity  and they were down 3.3%  against a high comparison basis. Negative repricing has eased (-1.3%) in a still competitive market while our new business picked up  on the back of our past investments  in particular in the mid-market segment.

TurnoverCoface recorded a consolidated turnover of €463.7m  down -1.6%% at constant perimeter and FX compared to Q1-23. As reported (at current FX and perimeter)  turnover was down -2.4%.Revenues from insurance activities (including bonding and Single Risk) was down by -3.3% at constant FX and perimeter due to a decline in inflation and the economic slowdown. Client retention remains high at 93.8% (down -1.9% on Q1-23)  in a competitive market where Coface implemented risk mitigation plans. Buoyed by an increase in demand and the positive effects of investments for growth  new business rose to €37m  up €5m compared to Q1-23.Growth in client activities was zero over the first three months of the year after two negative quarters in 2023. The price effect remained negative at -1.3% in Q1-24 but improved slightly compared to Q1-23 (-1.5%). This is largely due to very low past losses offset by the current normalisation environment.Turnover from non-insurance activities was up +6.5% compared to Q1-23. However  not all business lines enjoyed the same momentum. Turnover from factoring was down -6.3%  mainly due to the fall in volumes refinanced in Germany (-7.7%). Information services turnover continued to grow  by +21.6% (vs. +15.0% in Q1-23). Fee and commission income (debt collection commissions) increased +24.1% due to the increase in claims to be collected.

The region was hit by a slowdown in client activities and the selective renewal of some loss-making policies. This decline was partially offset by the growth in adjacent activities. Factoring turnover declined by -7.7%.In Western Europe  turnover was down by -5.8% at constant FX (-5.1% at current FX). The slowdown in client activities was partially offset by information sales. Q1-23 benefited from a positive accounting effect  the renewal of which impacted turnover by 1.5 ppt.In Central and Eastern Europe  turnover fell -3.5% at constant FX (+0.2% at current FX) due to the decline in client activities  which weighed on credit insurance.In the Mediterranean and Africa region  which is driven by Italy and Spain  turnover rose +7.3% at constant FX and +4.3% at current FX on the back of robust sales in credit insurance and services and a stronger economic environment.In North America  turnover was down -6.7% at constant FX but increased by +1.6% as reported due to the integration of Mexico. The region saw a slump in client activity despite higher retention.In Latin America  turnover fell by -11.0% at constant FX and -29.5% at current FX. The region was hit by a fall in client activity  mainly in commodities and metals  and the transfer of Mexico to the North America region.In Asia-Pacific  turnover decreased by -0.4% at constant FX and -3.1% at current FX  due to a slowdown in client activities.2. ResultCombined ratioThe combined ratio net of reinsurance stood at 63.1% for Q1-24 (an improvement of 3.2 ppts year on year and 4.1 ppts compared to the previous quarter).(i) Loss ratioThe gross loss ratio stood at 33.2%  down 7.5 ppts compared to the previous year. This improvement reflects the gradual normalisation of the loss experience  offset by high reserve releases. The number of mid-sized claims was below long-term trends.The Group’s provisioning policy remained unchanged. The amount of provisions related to the underwriting year  although discounted  remained in line with the historical average. Strict management of past claims enabled the Group to record 43.7 ppts of recoveries.The net loss ratio improved by 4.9 ppts compared to Q1-23  at 35.8%.(ii) Cost ratioCoface is pursuing a strict cost management policy while maintaining its investments  in line with the Power the Core strategic plan. In Q1-24  costs rose by +6.2% at constant perimeter and FX  and +5.6% at current FX.The cost ratio net of reinsurance was 27.3% in Q1-24  up 1.6 ppt year on year. This rise was mainly due to the decline in revenues (1.3 ppt)  cost inflation (1.3 ppt) and ongoing investments (1.1 ppt). In contrast  the improved product mix (information services  debt collection and fee and commission income) had a positive effect of 1.4 ppt. High reinsurance commissions explain the remaining of the variation.Financial resultNet financial income was +€17.9m over the first quarter. This amount includes realised capital gains  which more than offset negative market value adjustments on real estate investments (-€6.5m) and an FX effect of -€2.7m  mostly due to the application of IAS 29 (Hyperinflation) in Turkey and Argentina (service company).The portfolio’s current yield (i.e. excluding capital gains  depreciation and FX) was €19.9m. The accounting yield3  excluding capital gains and fair value effect  was 0.6% in Q1-24. The yield on new investments was 3.9%.Insurance Finance Expenses (IFE) stood at €11.4m for the first quarter due to higher discount rates and higher loss reserves.Operating income and net incomeOperating income amounted to €106.8m  up 18.6%.The effective tax rate was 27%  compared to 25% for Q1-23.In total  net income (group share) stood at €68.4m  up 11.9% compared to Q1-23.3.

OutlookThere were no major changes in the Global economic growth outlook in the first quarter of the year. Coface continues to expect full year growth to be down slightly from last year  with continued outperformance from the United States compared with Europe.On the inflation front  the slowdown in price increases led the market to anticipate several interest rate cuts. However  the start of the year saw an about-turn in market expectations. The market is now expecting more moderate rate cuts in the United States  where growth and the labour market remain robust. Europe should act sooner to reduce rates. As a result  the environment is likely to remain risky as diverging monetary policies generally cause financial tension and higher risks. High interest rates for a prolonged period typically put greater pressure on highly indebted companies.Political risk remains higher than ever with many elections still to come and several conflicts that have potential to take a turn for the worse.In this environment of continued uncertainty and modest growth outlook  Coface continues to implement its Power the Core strategic plan. The first quarter of 2024 marked an excellent start to this plan  with most key performance indicators positive.Conference call for financial analystsCoface’s results for 3M-2024 will be discussed with financial analysts during the conference call on Monday 6 May at 18.00 (Paris time).

Our credit insurance revenues were affected by the decline in inflation and sluggish client activity  and they were down 3.3%  against a high comparison basis. Negative repricing has eased (-1.3%) in a still competitive market while our new business picked up  on the back of our past investments  in particular in the mid-market segment. Service revenues  which are less cyclical  continued their double-digit rise.Consistently with the strategy developed in our Power the Core plan  we continued to invest in our risk infrastructure  to better serve our clients.Last  our net income increased by +11.9% year on year  to €68.4m  as the combined ratio remained under control at 63.1%.

TurnoverCoface recorded a consolidated turnover of €463.7m  down -1.6%% at constant perimeter and FX compared to Q1-23. As reported (at current FX and perimeter)  turnover was down -2.4%.Revenues from insurance activities (including bonding and Single Risk) was down by -3.3% at constant FX and perimeter due to a decline in inflation and the economic slowdown. Client retention remains high at 93.8% (down -1.9% on Q1-23)  in a competitive market where Coface implemented risk mitigation plans. Buoyed by an increase in demand and the positive effects of investments for growth  new business rose to €37m  up €5m compared to Q1-23.Growth in client activities was zero over the first three months of the year after two negative quarters in 2023. The price effect remained negative at -1.3% in Q1-24 but improved slightly compared to Q1-23 (-1.5%). This is largely due to very low past losses offset by the current normalisation environment.Turnover from non-insurance activities was up +6.5% compared to Q1-23. However  not all business lines enjoyed the same momentum. Turnover from factoring was down -6.3%  mainly due to the fall in volumes refinanced in Germany (-7.7%). Information services turnover continued to grow  by +21.6% (vs. +15.0% in Q1-23). Fee and commission income (debt collection commissions) increased +24.1% due to the increase in claims to be collected. Commissions were up +7.3%.Total revenue - in €m(by country of invoicing) Q1-23 Q1-24 Variation % ex.

The region was hit by a slowdown in client activities and the selective renewal of some loss-making policies. This decline was partially offset by the growth in adjacent activities. Factoring turnover declined by -7.7%.In Western Europe  turnover was down by -5.8% at constant FX (-5.1% at current FX). The slowdown in client activities was partially offset by information sales. Q1-23 benefited from a positive accounting effect  the renewal of which impacted turnover by 1.5 ppt.In Central and Eastern Europe  turnover fell -3.5% at constant FX (+0.2% at current FX) due to the decline in client activities  which weighed on credit insurance.In the Mediterranean and Africa region  which is driven by Italy and Spain  turnover rose +7.3% at constant FX and +4.3% at current FX on the back of robust sales in credit insurance and services and a stronger economic environment.In North America  turnover was down -6.7% at constant FX but increased by +1.6% as reported due to the integration of Mexico. The region saw a slump in client activity despite higher retention.In Latin America  turnover fell by -11.0% at constant FX and -29.5% at current FX. The region was hit by a fall in client activity  mainly in commodities and metals  and the transfer of Mexico to the North America region.In Asia-Pacific  turnover decreased by -0.4% at constant FX and -3.1% at current FX  due to a slowdown in client activities.2. ResultCombined ratioThe combined ratio net of reinsurance stood at 63.1% for Q1-24 (an improvement of 3.2 ppts year on year and 4.1 ppts compared to the previous quarter).(i) Loss ratioThe gross loss ratio stood at 33.2%  down 7.5 ppts compared to the previous year. This improvement reflects the gradual normalisation of the loss experience  offset by high reserve releases. The number of mid-sized claims was below long-term trends.The Group’s provisioning policy remained unchanged. The amount of provisions related to the underwriting year  although discounted  remained in line with the historical average. Strict management of past claims enabled the Group to record 43.7 ppts of recoveries.The net loss ratio improved by 4.9 ppts compared to Q1-23  at 35.8%.(ii) Cost ratioCoface is pursuing a strict cost management policy while maintaining its investments  in line with the Power the Core strategic plan. In Q1-24  costs rose by +6.2% at constant perimeter and FX  and +5.6% at current FX.The cost ratio net of reinsurance was 27.3% in Q1-24  up 1.6 ppt year on year. This rise was mainly due to the decline in revenues (1.3 ppt)  cost inflation (1.3 ppt) and ongoing investments (1.1 ppt). In contrast  the improved product mix (information services  debt collection and fee and commission income) had a positive effect of 1.4 ppt. High reinsurance commissions explain the remaining of the variation.Financial resultNet financial income was +€17.9m over the first quarter. This amount includes realised capital gains  which more than offset negative market value adjustments on real estate investments (-€6.5m) and an FX effect of -€2.7m  mostly due to the application of IAS 29 (Hyperinflation) in Turkey and Argentina (service company).The portfolio’s current yield (i.e. excluding capital gains  depreciation and FX) was €19.9m. The accounting yield3  excluding capital gains and fair value effect  was 0.6% in Q1-24. The yield on new investments was 3.9%.Insurance Finance Expenses (IFE) stood at €11.4m for the first quarter due to higher discount rates and higher loss reserves.Operating income and net incomeOperating income amounted to €106.8m  up 18.6%.The effective tax rate was 27%  compared to 25% for Q1-23.In total  net income (group share) stood at €68.4m  up 11.9% compared to Q1-23.3.

These results trended above the Company's guidance of +6-8% LFL for the second half of FY24. On a year-to-date basis  net revenues grew 13% on both a reported and LFL basis. In 3Q24 and year-to-date  the Company continued to deliver balanced reported net revenue growth  including growth in both Prestige and Consumer Beauty  across all regions and in each of its core categories partially offset by a 2% headwind in Q3 from the divestiture of the Lacoste license. In Q3 and year-to-date  Coty delivered a healthy reported growth mix with low to mid-single-digit percentage volume growth and estimated high-single-digit percentage pricing contribution  with the estimated impact from mix & other slightly negative in Q3  but a positive low-single-digit contribution fiscal year-to-date.In 3Q24  Prestige net revenues increased 8% on a reported basis and 13% on a LFL basis. On a year-to-date basis  Prestige net revenues grew a strong 17% on both a reported and LFL basis.

On a year-to-date basis  Consumer Beauty revenues increased 8% on a reported basis and 7% on a LFL basis. In 3Q24 and year-to-date  Consumer Beauty's reported net revenues grew in color cosmetics  mass fragrances and mass skin & body care in most countries  offsetting the market weakness in U.S. mass cosmetics.Strong reported net sales momentum in 3Q24 was supported by high-single-digit percentage growth in all regions  and on a year-to-date basis  all regions generated double-digit percentage reported net revenue growth. In Prestige  Coty gained market share in all three regions in Q3. Americas net revenues rose 8% on a reported basis and 11% on a LFL basis in Q3. Reported net revenue growth in Americas was driven by strong double-digit percentage growth in Latin America  Canada and the Travel Retail channel partially offset by a 2% negative impact from FX and a 1% headwind from the divestiture of the Lacoste license. In Q3  EMEA's net revenues increased 7% on a reported basis and 9% on a LFL basis. Reported net revenue growth in EMEA was driven by continued growth across most markets and the Travel Retail channel  coupled with a 2% FX benefit partially offset by a 4% headwind from the divestiture of the Lacoste license. In Q3  Asia Pacific sales grew 7% on a reported basis and 11% on a LFL basis.

Coty's Q3 reported gross margin improvement was driven by the benefit from premiumization  carryover pricing and easing inflation  as well as supply chain productivity savings. Coty generated reported operating income of $77.8 million  up 79% year-over-year  supported by strong sales and gross profit  resulting in 220 basis points of reported operating margin expansion to 5.6%. Coty's Q3 adjusted operating income of $143.9 million grew 17% year-over-year resulting in 90 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion to 10.4%.

Adjusted net income of $43.8 million decreased from $168.1 million. The decline in both reported and adjusted net income was fully driven by mark-to-market gains from forward repurchase contracts in the prior period compared to mark-to-market losses in the current period  partially offset by higher operating income in the current period. Q3 adjusted EBITDA of $199.9 million grew 10% year-over-year  which drove an increase in adjusted EBITDA margin of 30 basis points to 14.4%.In Q3  cash flow from operating activities was $(170.0) million and free cash flow was $(234.3) million consistent with the Company's seasonally weaker cash flow period. The seasonally low Q3 cash from operating activities and free cash flow was further pressured by the payment of taxes for prior years and the timing of working capital payments  the latter of which is expected to reverse in the fourth quarter. On a year-to-date basis  cash flow from operating activities was $438.1 million and free cash flow was $252.7 million. Total debt at the end of the third quarter totaled $3 972.3 million  while financial net debt totaled $3 712.1 million. This drove the total debt to net income ratio to 16.5x and the financial leverage ratio (net debt to adjusted EBITDA) to 3.4x. Coty’s retained 25.8% Wella stake was valued at $1 080.0 million at quarter-end  supporting economic net debt of $2 632.1 million.Updates on Strategic PillarsThe prestige fragrance market  whose growth accelerated sequentially to a mid-teens percentage in Q3  coupled with Coty’s market share gains  fueled strong prestige fragrances net revenue growth across multiple brands. Coty's prestige fragrance revenues grew approximately 7% as reported and 12% LFL in Q3  and approximately 18% as reported and LFL on a year-to-date basis  fueled by strength in existing icons coupled with the contribution from new launches. Burberry Goddess  Coty's biggest launch ever  continues to be a top global female fragrance launch  which coupled with strong growth in other Burberry franchises  drove over 50% expansion in Burberry's total net revenues in Q3. Building on this launch momentum  Marc Jacobs Daisy Wild and Cosmic Kylie Jenner are ranking as the Top 2 fragrance launches in the U.S. calendar year-to-date  reinforcing Coty's position as a fragrance leader. Coty's prestige cosmetics business saw very strong momentum with reported net revenue growth of over 25% in the quarter  led by its three prestige cosmetics brands  Burberry  Kylie and Gucci.Coty's Consumer Beauty growth in the quarter mirrored the mid-single-digit percentage growth of the global mass beauty market. Strong momentum in mass fragrance  skin & body care  and mass color cosmetics in most countries offset softness in the mass color cosmetics category in the United States. Coty’s continues to make strong strides in its social media advocacy strategy to drive improvements in earned media value and propel viral Consumer Beauty launches including CoverGirl Simply Ageless Skin Perfector Essence  CoverGirl Outlast Lipstain and Rimmel Wonder’Bond mascara. As a result  both CoverGirl in the U.S. and Rimmel in the U.K. reached Top 4 rankings for earned media value in their respective core markets.Coty’s prestige skincare business grew reported net revenues by a high-single-digit percentage in Q3 led by robust double-digit growth from Lancaster.Coty e-commerce channel net revenue growth was nearly 20% in Q3  following over 20% growth in 1H24. As a result  year-to-date e-commerce penetration increased approximately 190 basis points year-over year to approximately 20%. In Prestige  double-digit percentage e-commerce channel growth was driven by new product launches during the quarter  including Cosmic Kylie Jenner and Marc Jacobs Daisy Wild  coupled with strong social media activations and collaboration with e-retail partners. In Consumer Beauty  e-commerce growth of approximately 30% was supported by nearly all regions  led by the U.S.  LATAM and Europe. Coty gained e-commerce market share in both segments.The Company maintained momentum in high growth markets and channels. Coty's global Travel Retail trends were robust in all three regions  fueling reported net revenue growth of roughly 20% in Q3. In China  Coty’s Prestige business generated reported net revenue growth in the mid-teens percentage. The Company's momentum in growth engine markets continued to be robust  with mid-to-high teens reported revenue growth and over 20% LFL growth in Q3 and year-to-date  led by strength in Brazil  the rest of LATAM  Southeast Asia  including India  and Africa.Coty continued to make progress on its sustainability pillar during Q3  including improving several of its ESG ratings over the past year and transitioning additional supply chain sites  labs and offices to carbon neutral  bringing the total to eight carbon neutral1 locations.Commenting on the operating results  Sue Nabi  Coty's CEO  said:""Our Q3 results reinforce Coty's established track record of delivering results ahead of the beauty market and ahead of expectations  and once again illustrate that we are executing on our imperative to drive balanced portfolio growth. In both Q3 and fiscal year-to-date  we delivered strong growth in both the Prestige and Consumer Beauty businesses  in each of our three regions  and in our core categories of fragrances  color cosmetics  skin care and body care  all supported by a broad range of our leading brands.Coty's global and multi-category presence is proving to be a key area of strength and differentiation  as subdued trends in a very few markets and subcategories  such as U.S. mass cosmetics  are more than offset by continued strong momentum in the majority of our core business areas  including global prestige and mass fragrances  where our business grew by a low-double-digit percentage  and prestige cosmetics  where our sales grew over 20%. In fact  in Prestige fragrances  we've seen category growth trends accelerate over the course of the quarter  speaking to the continued appeal of fragrances to a broad set of consumers. And in this favorable backdrop  Coty is gaining prestige fragrance market share across regions.Our execution in our core businesses remains top notch. Building on our track record of leading fragrance launches in FY22 and FY23  we are elevating our leadership further with the blockbuster launch last fall of Burberry Goddess  which continues to grow and exceed all prior Coty benchmarks  and now in the spring the very successful launches of Marc Jacobs Daisy Wild and Cosmic Kylie Jenner  which are the #1 and #2 fragrance launches in the U.S. calendar year-to-date  respectively.In our color cosmetics business  first-to-market innovations like CoverGirl's Simply Ageless Skin Perfector Essence and Rimmel's Wonder’Bond mascara are resonating with consumers  while both brands are making strong strides in accelerating their advocacy across social media platforms. Both CoverGirl and Rimmel now rank in the Top 4 in terms of earned media value in their core markets of U.S. and U.K.  respectively  which is a significant improvement from last year.We are also complementing our core business momentum by unlocking white space opportunities. This quarter marked a major milestone  as we launched our Coty-branded Infiniment Coty Paris fragrance collection  revolutionizing the fragrance category once again through market-leading advances in the formula  packaging  artcycling and merchandising. As we build both Infiniment Coty Paris and our leading ultra premium fragrance collections  we look to capture a bigger slice of the booming ultra premium fragrance market.Similarly  our skincare momentum also continues to build with acceleration in Lancaster across both Europe and China  top industry awards and growing productivity for Orveda  and strong momentum in philosophy's social media resonance.Our growth is further reinforced by our strong e-commerce momentum with our online sales expanding approximately 20% in both Q3 and fiscal year-to-date and now accounting for one fifth of our business. I am particularly proud of our market share expansion in this critical channel  with share gains in both Prestige and Consumer Beauty.We are unlocking geographic white spaces as well  as our high-single-digit growth in developed markets was complemented by over 20% LFL expansion in growth engine markets  including Brazil  the rest of LATAM  Southeast Asia  including India  and Africa.We are achieving these strong results and milestones all while delivering robust profit growth and margin expansion. This is enabling us to raise the midpoint of our FY24 guidance for the third time this year. Our focus is to continue to fuel this flywheel  delivering steady margin expansion  cash flow improvement and deleveraging progress.In sum  we continue to see a strong and dynamic beauty market  with our diversified portfolio and strong execution enabling Coty to once again outperform the underlying market. As we continue to reinforce our position as a beauty powerhouse  in our 120th anniversary year  we remain excited by the many opportunities ahead.""1 For Scope 1 and 2 emissions.*Adjusted financial metrics used in this release are non-GAAP.

Coty continues to benefit from this attractive market dynamic with momentum across its core categories  strong launch results and early wins in key white spaces. The Company now expects FY24 LFL revenue growth to be at the high end of its prior guidance range of +9-11%  which includes expectations for low-to-mid single-digit percentage LFL revenue growth in Q4 reflecting an estimated mid-single-digit percentage headwind in its Prestige business from difficult prior year comparisons  when retailers restocked inventory as Coty's fragrance service levels recovered from earlier shortages. Reported revenues in Q4 are expected to include a 1-2% headwind from FX and an approximately 2% scope headwind from the divestiture of the Lacoste license. At the same time  the strong continued sell-out in Coty's business supports expected LFL revenue growth acceleration sequentially into first half FY25 from the levels expected in Q4.Coty also expects FY24 adjusted EBITDA margin expansion to be at the upper of end of its previous guidance range of 10 to 30 basis points. At the same time  FX headwinds in Q4 are contributing to Coty's expectations for FY24 adjusted EBITDA to remain within its prior guidance range of $1 080 to $1 090 million based on current FX rates. In total  the Company continues to expect modest FY24 gross margin expansion year-over-year. Coty now expects FY24 adjusted EPS to be at the high end of the prior guidance range  excluding the equity swap  of $0.44 to $0.47  implying strong growth at the upper end of the +16-25% guidance range.Factoring in the timing of certain deferred payments of taxes and working capital phasing  the Company continues to expect FY24 free cash flow of roughly $400 million  with expected free cash flow growth in FY25.Having reached its leverage target of approximately 3x exiting CY23  Coty remains fully on track to drive its leverage towards approximately 2.5x exiting CY24 and towards approximately 2x exiting CY25 driven by its free cash flow generation and EBITDA expansion. Coty continues to target the divestiture of its Wella stake by end of CY25.Financial Results*Refer to “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for discussion of the non-GAAP financial measures used in this release; reconciliations from reported to adjusted results can be found at the end of this release.Revenues:3Q24 reported net revenues of $1 385.6 increased 8% year-over-year driven by an 8% increase in Prestige reported net revenues  a 6% increase in Consumer Beauty reported net revenues and includes a 2% headwind from the divestiture of the Lacoste license.

means  unless the context otherwise indicates  “including without limitation”. More information about potential risks and uncertainties that could affect the Company’s business and financial results is included under the heading “Risk Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30  2023 and other periodic reports the Company has filed and may file with the SEC from time to time.All forward-looking statements made in this release are qualified by these cautionary statements. These forward-looking statements are made only as of the date of this release  and the Company does not undertake any obligation  other than as may be required by applicable law  to update or revise any forward-looking or cautionary statements to reflect changes in assumptions  the occurrence of events  unanticipated or otherwise  or changes in future operating results over time or otherwise.Comparisons of results for current and any prior periods are not intended to express any future trends or indications of future performance unless expressed as such  and should only be viewed as historical data.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThe Company operates on a global basis  with the majority of net revenues generated outside of the U.S. Accordingly  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can affect results of operations. Therefore  to supplement financial results presented in accordance with GAAP  certain financial information is presented excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange translations to provide a framework for assessing how the underlying businesses performed excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange translations (“constant currency”). Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant period-over-period  with the current period’s results calculated at the prior-year period’s rates. The Company calculates constant currency information by translating current and prior-period results for entities reporting in currencies other than U.S. dollars into U.S. dollars using constant foreign currency exchange rates. The constant currency calculations do not adjust for the impact of revaluing specific transactions denominated in a currency that is different to the functional currency of that entity when exchange rates fluctuate. The constant currency information presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The Company discloses the following constant currency financial measures: net revenues  organic like-for-like (LFL) net revenues  adjusted gross profit and adjusted operating income.The Company presents period-over-period comparisons of net revenues on a constant currency basis as well as on an organic (LFL) basis. The Company believes that organic (LFL) better enables management and investors to analyze and compare the Company's net revenues performance from period to period. For the periods described in this release  the term “like-for-like” describes the Company's core operating performance  excluding the financial impact of (i) acquired brands or businesses in the current year period until we have twelve months of comparable financial results  (ii) the divested brands or businesses or early terminated brands  generally  in the prior year non-comparable periods  to maintain comparable financial results with the current fiscal year period and (iii) foreign currency exchange translations to the extent applicable. For a reconciliation of organic (LFL) period-over-period  see the table entitled “Reconciliation of Reported Net Revenues to Like-For-Like Net Revenues”.The Company presents operating income  operating income margin  gross profit  gross margin  effective tax rate  net income  net income margin  net revenues  EBITDA  and EPS (diluted) on a non-GAAP basis and specifies that these measures are non-GAAP by using the term “adjusted” (collectively the Adjusted Performance Measures). The reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP are shown in tables below. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from  or as a substitute for or superior to  financial measures reported in accordance with GAAP. Moreover  these non-GAAP financial measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all the items associated with the operations of the business as determined in accordance with GAAP. Other companies  including companies in the beauty industry  may calculate similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do  limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.Adjusted operating income/Adjusted EBITDA from Coty Inc.  (as well as adjusted operating income margin and adjusted EBITDA margin  which are calculated by dividing Adjusted operating income from Coty Inc. and Adjusted EBITDA from Coty Inc.  respectively  by net revenues) exclude restructuring costs and business structure realignment programs  amortization  acquisition- and divestiture-related costs and acquisition accounting impacts  stock-based compensation  and asset impairment charges and other adjustments as described below. For adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin  in addition to the preceding  we exclude the adjusted depreciation as defined below. We do not consider these items to be reflective of our core operating performance due to the variability of such items from period-to-period in terms of size  nature and significance. They are primarily incurred to realign our operating structure and integrate new acquisitions  and exclude divestitures  and fluctuate based on specific facts and circumstances. Additionally  Adjusted net income attributable to Coty Inc. and Adjusted net income attributable to Coty Inc. per common share are adjusted for certain interest and other (income) expense and deemed preferred stock dividends  as described below  and the related tax effects of each of the items used to derive Adjusted net income as such charges are not used by our management in assessing our operating performance period-to-period.Adjusted Performance Measures reflect adjustments based on the following items:Costs related to acquisition and divestiture activities: The Company has excluded acquisition- and divestiture-related costs and the accounting impacts such as those related to transaction costs and costs associated with the revaluation of acquired inventory in connection with business combinations because these costs are unique to each transaction. Additionally  for divestitures  the Company excludes write-offs of assets that are no longer recoverable and contract related costs due to the divestiture. The nature and amount of such costs vary significantly based on the size and timing of the acquisitions and divestitures  and the maturities of the businesses being acquired or divested. Also  the size  complexity and/or volume of past transactions  which often drives the magnitude of such expenses  may not be indicative of the size  complexity and/or volume of any future acquisitions or divestitures.Restructuring and other business realignment costs: The Company has excluded the costs associated with restructuring and business structure realignment programs to allow for comparable financial results to historical operations and forward-looking guidance. In addition  the nature and amount of such charges vary significantly based on the size and timing of the programs. By excluding the referenced expenses from the non-GAAP financial measures  management is able to further evaluate the Company's ability to utilize existing assets and estimate their long-term value. Furthermore  our management believes that the adjustment of these items supplements the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the sustainability of operating performance.Asset impairment charges: The Company has excluded the impact of asset impairments as such non-cash amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and/or size of acquisitions. Our management believes that the adjustment of these items supplements the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance.Amortization expense: The Company has excluded the impact of amortization of finite-lived intangible assets  as such non-cash amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the timing and/or size of acquisitions. Our management believes that the adjustment of these items supplements the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance. Although we exclude amortization of intangible assets from our non-GAAP expenses  our management believes that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets contribute to revenue generation. Amortization of intangible assets that relate to past acquisitions will recur in future periods until such intangible assets have been fully amortized. Any future acquisitions may result in the amortization of additional intangible assets.Gain on sale and early license termination: We have excluded the impact of gain on sale and early license termination as such amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the size of the sale and early license termination.Costs related to market exit: We have excluded the impact of direct incremental costs related to our decision to wind down our business operations in Russia. We believe that these direct and incremental costs are inconsistent and infrequent in nature. Consequently  our management believes that the adjustment of these items supplements the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance.Gains on sale of real estate: The Company has excluded the impact of Gains on sale of real estate as such amounts are inconsistent in amount and frequency and are significantly impacted by the size of the sale. Our management believes that the adjustment of these items supplements the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance.Stock-based compensation: Although stock-based compensation is a key incentive offered to our employees  we have excluded the effect of these expenses from the calculation of adjusted operating income and adjusted EBITDA. This is due to their primarily non-cash nature; in addition  the amount and timing of these expenses may be highly variable and unpredictable  which may negatively affect comparability between periods.Depreciation and Adjusted depreciation: Our adjusted operating income excludes the impact of accelerated depreciation for certain restructuring projects that affect the expected useful lives of Property  Plant and Equipment  as such charges vary significantly based on the size and timing of the programs. Further  we have excluded adjusted depreciation  which represents depreciation expense net of accelerated depreciation charges  from our adjusted EBITDA. Our management believes that the adjustment of these items supplements the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance.Other (income) expense: We have excluded the impact of pension curtailment (gains) and losses and pension settlements as such events are triggered by our restructuring and other business realignment activities and the amount of such charges vary significantly based on the size and timing of the programs. Further  we have excluded the change in fair value of the investment in Wella  as well as expenses related to potential or actual sales transactions reducing equity investments  as our management believes these unrealized (gains) and losses do not reflect our underlying ongoing business  and the adjustment of such impact helps investors and others compare and analyze performance from period to period. We have excluded the gain on the exchange of Series B Preferred Stock. Such transactions do not reflect our operating results and we have excluded the impact as our management believes that the adjustment of these items supplements the GAAP information with a measure that can be used to assess the sustainability of our operating performance.Noncontrolling interest: This adjustment represents the after-tax impact of the non-GAAP adjustments included in Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests based on the relevant noncontrolling interest percentage.Tax: This adjustment represents the impact of the tax effect of the pretax items excluded from Adjusted net income. The tax impact of the non-GAAP adjustments is based on the tax rates related to the jurisdiction in which the adjusted items are received or incurred. Additionally  adjustments are made for the tax impact of any intra-entity transfer of assets and liabilities.Deemed Preferred Stock Dividends: The Company has excluded preferred stock deemed dividends related to the First Exchange and the Second Exchange from our calculation of adjusted net income attributable to Coty Inc. These deemed dividends are non-monetary in nature  the transactions were entered into to simplify our capital structure and do not reflect our underlying ongoing business. Management believes that this adjustment helps investors and others compare and analyze our performance from period to period.The Company has provided a quantitative reconciliation of the difference between the non-GAAP financial measures and the financial measures calculated and reported in accordance with GAAP. For a reconciliation of adjusted gross profit to gross profit  adjusted EPS (diluted) to EPS (diluted)  and adjusted net revenues to net revenues  see the table entitled “Reconciliation of Reported to Adjusted Results for the Consolidated Statements of Operations.” For a reconciliation of adjusted operating income to operating income and adjusted operating income margin to operating income margin  see the tables entitled “Reconciliation of Reported Operating Income (Loss) to Adjusted Operating Income” and ""Reconciliation of Reported Operating Income (Loss) to Adjusted Operating Income by Segment."" For a reconciliation of adjusted effective tax rate to effective tax rate  see the table entitled “Reconciliation of Reported Income (Loss) Before Income Taxes and Effective Tax Rates to Adjusted Income Before Income Taxes and Adjusted Effective Tax Rates.” For a reconciliation of adjusted net income and adjusted net income margin to net income (loss)  see the table entitled “Reconciliation of Reported Net Income (Loss) to Adjusted Net Income.”The Company also presents free cash flow  adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization (""adjusted EBITDA"")  Financial Net Debt and Economic Net Debt. Management believes that these measures are useful for investors because it provides them with an important perspective on the cash available for debt repayment and other strategic measures and provides them with the same measures that management uses as the basis for making resource allocation decisions. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures; adjusted EBITDA is defined as adjusted operating income  excluding adjusted depreciation and non-cash stock-based compensation. Net debt or Financial Net Debt (which the Company referred to as ""net debt"" in prior reporting periods) is defined as total debt less cash and cash equivalents  and Economic Net Debt is defined as total debt less cash and cash equivalents less the value of the Wella Stake. For a reconciliation of Free Cash Flow  see the table entitled “Reconciliation of Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Free Cash Flow ” for adjusted EBITDA  see the table entitled “Reconciliation of Adjusted Operating Income to Adjusted EBITDA” and for Financial Net Debt and Economic Net Debt  see the tables entitled “Reconciliation of Total Debt to Financial Net Debt and Economic Net Debt.”These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation  or as a substitute for  or superior to  financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.To the extent that the Company provides guidance  it does so only on a non-GAAP basis and does not provide reconciliations of such forward-looking non-GAAP measures to GAAP due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliation  including adjustments that could be made for restructuring  integration and acquisition-related expenses  amortization expenses  non-cash stock-based compensation  adjustments to inventory  and other charges reflected in our reconciliation of historic numbers  the amount of which  based on historical experience  could be significant.- Tables Follow -COTY INC.SUPPLEMENTAL SCHEDULES INCLUDING NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESTHIRD QUARTER BY SEGMENT (COTY INC)Three Months Ended March 31  Net Revenues Change Reported Operating Income (Loss) Adjusted Operating Income (in millions) 2024 2023 Reported Basis LFL 2024 Change Margin 2024 Change Margin Prestige $ 867.2 $ 799.7 8 % 13 % $ 108.7 6 % 13 % $ 147.3 5 % 17 % Consumer Beauty 518.4 489.2 6 % 6 % (13.3 ) 52 % (3 )% (3.4 ) 81 % (1 %) Corporate — — N/A 0 % (17.6 ) 43 % N/A — N/A N/A Total $ 1 385.6 $ 1 288.9 8 % 10 % $ 77.8 79 % 6 % $ 143.9 17 % 10 %Nine Months Ended March 31  Net Revenues Change Reported Operating Income (Loss) Adjusted Operating Income (in millions) 2024 2023 Reported Basis LFL 2024 Change Margin 2024 Change Margin Prestige $ 3 054.5 $ 2 620.9 17 % 17 % $ 531.0 21 % 17 % $ 646.6 18 % 21 % Consumer Beauty 1 700.1 1 581.6 8 % 7 % 79.0 48 % 5 % 108.8 30 % 6 % Corporate — — N/A N/A (98.0 ) (29 %) N/A — N/A N/A Total $ 4 754.6 $ 4 202.5 13 % 13 % $ 512.0 23 % 11 % $ 755.4 19 % 16 %Adjusted EBITDA Three Months Ended March 31  Nine Months Ended March 31  (in millions) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Prestige $ 173.0 $ 169.3 $ 726.8 $ 632.9 Consumer Beauty 26.9 12.6 199.8 174.5 Corporate — — — — Total $ 199.9 $ 181.9 $ 926.6 $ 807.4THIRD QUARTER FISCAL 2024 BY REGIONCoty  Inc.Three Months Ended March 31  Nine Months Ended March 31  Net Revenues Change Net Revenues Change (in millions) 2024 2023 Reported Basis LFL 2024 2023 Reported Basis LFL Americas $ 589.0 $ 543.8 8 % 11 % $ 1 984.9 $ 1 775.8 12 % 13 % EMEA 628.0 587.6 7 % 9 % 2 185.9 1 910.3 14 % 12 % Asia Pacific 168.6 157.5 7 % 11 % 583.8 516.4 13 % 16 % Total $ 1 385.6 $ 1 288.9 8 % 10 % $ 4 754.6 $ 4 202.5 13 % 13 %COTY INC. & SUBSIDIARIESCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONSThree Months Ended March 31  Nine Months Ended March 31  (in millions  except per share data) 2024 2023 2024 2023 Net revenues $ 1 385.6 $ 1 288.9 $ 4 754.6 $ 4 202.5 Cost of sales 487.8 478.1 1 690.8 1 504.7 as % of Net revenues 35.2 % 37.1 % 35.6 % 35.8 % Gross profit 897.8 810.8 3 063.8 2 697.8 Gross margin 64.8 % 62.9 % 64.4 % 64.2 % Selling  general and administrative expenses 770.6 720.4 2 371.4 2 145.4 as % of Net revenues 55.6 % 55.9 % 49.9 % 51.1 % Amortization expense 48.5 48.2 145.4 143.1 Restructuring costs 0.9 (1.3 ) 35.0 (5.4 ) Operating income 77.8 43.5 512.0 414.7 as % of Net revenues 5.6 % 3.4 % 10.8 % 9.9 % Interest expense  net 60.4 58.8 190.3 185.7 Other income  net 14.0 (156.9 ) 9.8 (397.0 ) Income before income taxes 3.4 141.6 311.9 626.0 as % of Net revenues 0.2 % 11.0 % 6.6 % 14.9 % Provision for income taxes (5.4 ) 29.8 106.9 138.3 Net income 8.8 111.8 205.0 487.7 as % of Net revenues 0.6 % 8.7 % 4.3 % 11.6 % Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests 2.4 1.0 4.0 (0.4 ) Net income attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interests 2.6 2.4 14.7 12.8 Net income attributable to Coty Inc. $ 3.8 $ 108.4 $ 186.3 $ 475.3 Amounts attributable to Coty Inc.

These documents are therefore not distributed together with the notice of the meeting. The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting adopts a dividend payment of NOK 2.50 per share. The Board's proposed allocation of the annual profit of NOK 1 551 016 000 this year implies that NOK 61 582 000 shall be transferred from other equity and that NOK 1 489 434 000 is paid as dividend to the Company's shareholders. The Board of Directors proposes the following resolution to the Annual General Meeting: The annual financial statements and annual report are approved. Dividends shall be paid in the amount of NOK 1 489 434 000  equivalent to NOK 2.50 per share. The dividend shall be paid to the shareholders who are registered shareholders of Lerøy Seafood Group ASA as of 28 May 2024  as it will appear in the VPS-depository from 30 May 2024 (Record date). The shares will be traded ex dividend from and including 29 May 2024. The dividend shall be paid on or around 5 June 2024. NOK 61 582 000 shall be transferred from other equity. ITEM 5: STIPULATION OF REMUNERATION TO THE MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS  AUDIT COMMITTEE AND NOMINATION COMMITTEE FOR THE PERIODS 2023/2024 AND 2024/2025. STIPULATION OF REMUNERATION TO THE COMPANY'S AUDITOR FOR 2023. The Nomination Committee proposes to change the practice for the general meeting's stipulation of remuneration to the members of the Board of Directors  the Audit Committee and the Nomination Committee so that remuneration is stipulated for the period until the next Annual General Meeting. Such a change will contribute to provide predictability both for those who are elected and for the company's work with the reporting on remuneration for senior executives. For this reason  it is proposed that the company's Annual General Meeting for 2024 stipulates remuneration for both the period 2023/2024 and the period 2024/2025.4/7 The Nomination Committee has made the following recommendations for stipulation of remuneration: The committee recommends that the remuneration for the members of the Board of Directors for the period 2023/2024 shall be stipulated as follows: To the Chairman NOK 500 000 To the Board members NOK 300 000 The committee recommends that the remuneration for the members of the Board of Directors for the period 2024/2025 shall be stipulated as follows: To the Chairman NOK 650 000 To the Board members NOK 400 000 The committee recommends that the remuneration for the members of the Audit Committee for the period 2023/2024 shall be stipulated as follows: To the Chairman NOK 120 000 To the other members NOK 80 000 The committee recommends that the remuneration for the members of the Audit Committee for the period 2024/2025 shall be stipulated as follows: To the Chairman NOK 120 000 To the other members NOK 80 000 The committee recommends that the remuneration for the members of the Nomination Committee for the period 2023/2024 shall be stipulated as follows: To the Chairman and the other members NOK 65 000 The committee recommends that the remuneration for the members of the Nomination Committee for the period 2024/2025 shall be stipulated as follows: To the Chairman and the other members NOK 65 000 The Board of Directors recommends that the remuneration for fee paid to the Company's auditor shall be stipulated as follows: g) The auditor's fee for 2023 totals NOK 2 871 207 Information on total remuneration for audit and assistance is stated in note 11 in Lerøy Seafood Group ASA's financial statements.5/7 ITEM 6: THE BOARD OF DIRECTOR'S REPORT ON SALARIES AND OTHER REMUNERATION TO EXECUTIVE PERSONNEL In accordance with section 6-16b of the Public Limited Liability Companies Act the Board of Directors have prepared a report on salaries and other remuneration to executive personnel. Pursuant to section 5-6 fourth paragraph of the Public Limited Liability Companies Act the General Meeting shall cast an advisory vote over the report. The report is based on the guidelines for the fixing of salaries and other remuneration to executive personnel which was approved by the Annual General Meeting in 2021 and is published on the company's website: https://www.leroyseafood.com/no/investor/eierstyring-og-selskapsledelse/. It is proposed that the General Meeting endorses the report. ITEM 7: STATEMENT ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE The Board of Directors refers to the provisions of section 3-3b of the Norwegian Accounting Act which stipulates that reporting entities that are issuers in Norway and whose securities are listed in a regulated market shall provide a report on the principles and practices for corporate governance. The Board of Directors also refers to section 5-6 fifth paragraph of the Norwegian Public Limited Liability Companies Act which stipulates that companies with a statutory obligation to provide such a report on corporate governance pursuant to section 3-3b of the Norwegian Accounting Act  shall also discuss this report during the Annual General Meeting Lerøy Seafood Group follows the updated recommendation on corporate governance published by the Norwegian Corporate Governance Board and dated October 2021 (at www.nues.no). The recommended Code of Practice shall help clarify the distribution of roles among shareholders  board members and management  in addition to that required by legislation. The Code of Practice is based on the ""comply or explain"" principle which also forms the basis for the Company's report. In the Board of Directors' report for 2023  the Board has described the Company's principles and practice for corporate governance  and the Board of Directors therefore refers to the description provided in the Board of Directors' report  and the separate chapter in the Company's annual report on corporate governance. The Board of Directors also refers to the fact that the Annual General Meeting is not expected to specifically approve the report  and that the report is for information purposes only. ITEM 8: ELECTION OF BOARD OF DIRECTORS Election of Board of Directors: Please see the recommendation from the Nomination Committee published on the Company's website: https://www.leroyseafood.com/en/investor/corporate-governance/6/7 ITEM 9: THE BOARD'S PROPOSAL REGARDING RENEWAL OF THE BOARD'S MANDATE TO PURCHASE TREASURY SHARES On 23 May 2023  the Annual General Meeting granted to the Board of Directors a mandate to purchase up to 50 000 000 of the company's treasury shares  each with a nominal value of NOK 0.10. The purchase price must be no lower than NOK 1.00 and no higher that NOK 180.00 per share. The Board is free to choose the methods of acquisition and disposal. This mandate is valid until 23 November 2024. It is the opinion of the Board that the Board of Directors should continue to have the right to purchase the treasury shares  and that the existing mandate should therefore be renewed  with a highest amount of NOK 180.00. It is conceivable that situations could arise in the future where the Board will find that the market's pricing of the Company's shares does not reflect the Company's intrinsic values and that the Company has ample equity and cash flows  and that the Board finds investment in treasury shares attractive. The purchase of treasury shares in such a situation may represent an improvement in return for the Company's investors. Such purchases are also generally viewed as positive by the equity market because of the signaling effect they have with respect to the administration's expectations for the future of the company. The possession of treasury shares will also provide the Board with greater flexibility for future growth with respect to future acquisitions  business combinations and the establishment of cooperative ventures. Finally  the purchase of treasury shares may be used in connection with a possible establishment of general share savings programmes and incentive schemes  including discounted purchase of shares in accordance with the Norwegian Taxation Act  for the employees of the company and its subsidiaries. The Board therefore proposes that the Annual General Meeting makes the following resolution: ""The Board is hereby authorised pursuant to Section 9-4 of the Public Limited Liability Companies Act to purchase on behalf of the Company up to 50 000 000 shares  each with a nominal value of NOK 0.10. The lowest amount that shall be paid for the shares is NOK 1 per share  and the highest amount is NOK 180 per share. The Board shall be granted freedom with respect to acquisition methods and disposal. The mandate shall apply for 18 months from the date of the resolution. The mandate replaces the mandate to purchase treasury shares  which the Board was assigned at the Annual General Meeting on 23 May 2023.""7/7 ITEM 10: THE BOARD'S PROPOSAL REGARDING RENEWAL OF THE BOARD'S MANDATE TO INCREASE SHARE CAPITAL BY ISSUING NEW SHARES THROUGH PRIVATE PLACEMENTS DIRECTED AT EXTERNAL INVESTORS  EMPLOYEES AND CERTAIN SHAREHOLDERS OF LERØY SEAFOOD GROUP ASA On 23 May 2023  the Annual General Meeting authorised the Board of Directors to increase the share capital by up to NOK 5 000 000 by issuing up to 50 000 000 new shares through private placements. The mandate permitted the waiver of pre-emptive rights and included business combinations. The mandate was not utilised in 2023. The Board finds it appropriate that an equivalent board mandate should be renewed  including the possibility for the Board to be able to derogate from the shareholder's preemptive rights. The Board expects to see continued restructuring and internationalisation in the Company's industry. Lerøy Seafood Group ASA will therefore continually assess the potential for organic growth  the possibilities for establishment of share savings programmes and incentive schemes for the employees  including discounted purchases of shares in accordance with the Norwegian Taxation Act  the possibilities for acquisition and business combination alternatives  and possible alliances that may enhance the basis for further profitable growth  both in order to capitalise on the values that have been created and to position itself for further value creation. This Board mandate will afford the Company the necessary financial flexibility to be able to quickly obtain the necessary liquidity and/or shares that the Board finds necessary to be able to ensure further profitable growth. The Board therefore proposes that the Annual General Meeting makes the following resolution: ""The Board is hereby authorised pursuant to Section 10-14 of the Public Limited Liability Companies Act to increase the share capital by up to NOK 5 000 000 by issuing up to 50 000 000 shares in Lerøy Seafood Group ASA  each with a nominal value of NOK 0.10  by one or more private placements directed at the Company's shareholders  employees and/or external investors. The mandate applies for two years from the resolution date. The shareholders' pre-emptive rights to subscribe pursuant to Section 10-4 of the Public Limited Liability Companies Act can be set aside  cf. Section 10-5 of the Public Limited Liability Companies Act. The mandate applies to both contributions of assets other than money and/or the right to impose special obligations on the Company  cf. Section 10-2 of the Public Limited Liability Companies Act. Furthermore  the mandate includes a merger resolution pursuant to Section 13-5 of the Public Limited Liability Companies Act. The mandate replaces the mandate to increase the share capital through the issue of new shares granted at the Annual General Meeting on 23 May 2023. The Board shall be authorised to carry out the amendments to the Articles of Association necessitated by the share capital increase.""Ref no: PIN - code: Notice of General Meeting General Meeting in Lerøy Seafood Group ASA will be held on 28 May 2024  10:00 CET as a virtual meeting.

See disclosureorTony Smurfit: Thank you  Ciaran and thank you all for joining us today. As you may have seen from this morning's release  we reported EBITDA of €487 million for the period  with an EBITDA margin of 18%. The delivery of another excellent performance reflects  as we have said before  both the operating excellence of our people and the continuing benefits of our multiyear capital plans. Some 6 billion of capital spend over the last 8 years in our mill and corrugated systems has optimized our integrated operating model  reduce costs throughout our mill system and ensured our corrugated system has the highest quality  the highest service and the highest innovation capabilities for our customers. In parallel  we have also developed and grown our higher-margin specialty businesses. Smurfit Kappa's long-standing and proven management team has built a formidable business continuing to deliver superior performance across all market conditions. As we expected  corrugated demand growth progressively improved from Q4 of 2023  with volume growth of approximately 3% and 2% for Europe and the Americas  respectively. We are also seeing an improving pricing environment and we'll characterize current trading conditions as encouraging. Longer term  both innovation and sustainability are positive structural trends supporting our customer base and growth. After the quarter end  on April 3  we were pleased to announce the successful completion of a $2.75 billion green bonds offering  the proceeds of which will be used in part to finance the combination with WestRock announced last September. We continue to work well with the WestRock team with integration planning progressing. Subject  of course  to shareholder  regulatory approval and the satisfaction of other closing conditions  we expect the combination with WestRock to complete in early July. The quality of Smurfit Kappa's people  it's performance-led culture  its operating excellence and measured capital plans have built a business that consistently delivers. But against an improving industry backdrop with positive long-term trends and through the creation of a global leader in innovative and sustainable packaging  the combination of Smurfit and WestRock marks the next and very exciting phase of our journey. With those brief comments  I will now pass it over to you  operator and to the audience to ask any questions about the performance. Thank you.here or remove ads . 3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com. See disclosureorOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Cole Hathorn of Jefferies.Cole Hathorn: Just like to follow up on the very strong Q1 EBITDA  I mean  if you think that this should be the period where you've passed on all the lower box pricing. So effectively  the trough point in the pricing cycle  the €487 million is a really strong number. I'm just wondering what supported the EBITDA in Q1. Is there something on costs we should be thinking about  is the first question?Tony Smurfit: Cole  I think  what we said all along is that we have been strongly recovering price through the up cycle and we've been holding on to the price during the down cycle for the most part. But the real reason we continue to perform well is because we have developed a plan and a business that works very well together. So the capital that we've been putting into the business  we've told you and everybody that we intend to get those returns out of the capital we put into it. Otherwise  we shouldn't be putting it in. And the first quarter numbers demonstrate strongly that our improved efficiency -- sorry  there's a massive thunderstorm going on outside my window here. The improved efficiency of our operations  it comes through. And when those capital plans are put in place and executed as well as we have that I think it shows in the numbers and that's one reason. Equally  we continue to support our customers with innovation and development and we obviously expect to get paid for what we do and that's what we get. I think with regards to the bottom point  Q1  yes  the box demand  as you know  the way the system works is box demand as paper pricing goes down  box prices go down. And we've seen that in Q1 and we would still expect to see a little bit of a tail of that in Q2  albeit that will be changing as we go into the second half. And I would say that the -- and what's supporting the paper price increases right now is a lot of the cost increases that we're getting. We've seen wastepaper move up sharply during the last 2 months. That may have some very short-term margin compression as we go through Q2. But then that will be recovered in paper prices in Q3 and Q4 -- I'm sorry  in Q2  Q3 and that's going to reflect itself in box prices later on. So this is the same as what we've done before but from a higher base because of our investment plans and the development that we've done within the company over the last number of years. Ken  I don't know if you want to add anything?here or remove ads . 3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com. See disclosureorKen Bowles: No  I think you got it all there. I think in reality  Cole  when you look at the pluses  minuses  it really does come down to pricing and volume year-on-year. I mean there's a lot of offsetting within the kind of the headwinds you're seeing around recovered fiber and indeed  where the box price has gone but clearly  some savings on energy  some savings in [indiscernible]. I think Tony picked up there first which is -- the biggest impact here is everything we've done over the last number of years  it's not a single quarter. It's multiyear capital programs and the benefits of those.Cole Hathorn: And then maybe as a big picture  should we be thinking that near term  we've got obviously an OCC headwind into Q2 but then recovery into the back half as those kind of box pricing comes through? And maybe on that  is it OCC prices are moving higher because there's good demand pull into the mill system  so effectively calling out demand a bit better which I'd argue is a positive. And then can you give any comments a few people are out with price increases for June? I'm just wondering if you can comment on that. I completely understand if not.Tony Smurfit: Yes. No  we have announced to our customers increases for June and for May -- May and June  both in recycled and kraftliner. And the -- so I think that -- with regard to wastepaper  yes  wastepaper moved up sharply because demand is a bit better and there is a bit of a pull around the place. So I think  yes  that's the reason. Also there's less generation because a lot of the  let's call it  the publication papers are -- and some of the other mix grades are less because of the overall macro effects of some of the economic issues that are out there. So I think that it does look pretty good for the second half.here or remove ads . 3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com. See disclosureorOperator: And our next question now comes from Charlie Muir-Sands from BNP Paribas (OTC: ) Exane.Charlie Muir-Sands: Just 2 for me  please. Firstly  could you give us a little bit of color on any kind of standout leaders in that regards in terms of category and geography performance? And then secondly  the final draft of PPWR is now being voted through by the EU Parliament. I know there's a lot of detailed technical guidance now getting drafted in but I wondered if you had any evolved thoughts on how that's going to affect the business positively or negatively in the future?Tony Smurfit: With regard to the grades that we're in  I would say that the -- I mean  our kraftliner market is strong  brown kraftliner is strong  recycled is good. And most of our countries  especially the southern countries are doing well. Germany still is a bit of a laggard. Although I was in Germany last week  we are seeing some pickup. I don't want to call a strong pickup there yet but it was certainly more encouraging last week than I have seen in a while. But then I did say that last April  it ended up being a bit flat. So I don't want to call anything too early in Germany. But overall  the periphery countries are doing okay  are well in certain cases  like countries like Spain. And the major industrial companies a little bit better than we've seen in the last 6 months or so. So with regard to categories  we still see  obviously areas like cars and other areas  not pulling but the consumer goods are generally okay. Ken  do you want to take the PPWR?here or remove ads . 3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com. See disclosureorKen Bowles: Sure. Charlie  on PPWR  look  I think it's fair to say that the net outcome has been very positive for our industry. I think it's -- I think in the final draft of what we saw  I think the efforts of the industry and everybody within it kind of properly reflect the sustainability and the circular aspects of corrugated predominantly had been taken into account  I think it sets us up very well. I think  particularly in areas like e-commerce and reuse  I think they're reflected much better in terms of the model that was initially put out  as you know  a couple of years ago which kind of would never worked anyway. I think we sort of have to go back to the basic principle which is corrugated packaging is quite simply the most recycled packaging in the world anyway. We hit 90%-plus recycling rates. So we were starting off of a position of strength. And it was about making sure that  that position strength was reflected in the legislation. And I think it's fair to say we got there. But probably  I think it sets up the industry from a sustainability [indiscernible] and the growth perspective quite well for the years ahead.Operator: And up next now  we have Justin Jordan from Davy.Justin Jordan: I've got 2 quick questions. Tony  firstly  you described current trading as encouraging. Should we infer that  that is perhaps slightly better in April  May than the 3% box volumes in Europe that reported in Q1. And secondly  just on the back of that encouraging trading  you talked about containable price increases and being communicated from Smurfit Kappa customers from May  June. I'm just wondering if you can quantify the quantum of that. Swedish peer has announced a €60 tonne virgin containable price increase for June. Is the Smurfit targeting a similar quantum of increases in May  June with customers?here or remove ads . 3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com. See disclosureorTony Smurfit: Yes  to the second question  it's broadly similar. A little bit more  a little bit less  depending on the grade but basically  it's similar. With regard to the encouraging remarks  I mean  I don't want to say yet that it's better than the first quarter because Easter sell in March and that has a little bit of a distorting effect when you look at April's volume. But certainly  as I said earlier  when I go around the facilities that I've been around in the last 2 weeks or so  there's definitely a better feel about things than before. And certainly  other grades that we do some of the specialty products that we make are more busy than they have been in the last 6 months or so. So it is encouraging but I don't want to call out in -- it's a bit early to say. It's a big improvement versus Q1.Operator: And from Stifel  we have Lars Kjellberg with our next question.Lars Kjellberg: I just want to come back a bit to the cost equation. You called out energy as a tailwind  of course  OCC as a headwind  looking ahead. Could you share with us how you think about the bigger cost elements in the balance of the year  including energy in particular? And also  if there's any way you can parse out the benefits from your investment program that contributed in Q1? And how we should think about that as the full year. And Tony  the final question on the bag-in-box business is something that you've invested quite a bit. Can you share with us how that's performing? And if that also went through a destocking phase now starting to see volume coming back.here or remove ads . 3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com. See disclosureorTony Smurfit: I'll take -- I'll leave the cost question to Ken but on the bag-in-box  as you know  we -- we have probably a number 2 position in the world in that business and we intend to continue to develop that business and we've been investing accordingly to do that. Actually  the bag-in-box business in Q1 was as weak as I've seen for a while. But it is encouraging that it's getting much better as we've gone through April and our order books for May and June  albeit that it's a slightly weather-dependent and weather hasn't been great in Europe. So -- but I'm much more encouraged from what I've seen in the last 6 weeks or so in the bag-in-box business versus Q1  still performing very well  still an excellent business for us. And still worth investing a lot of money behind to continue to develop to be probably the number 1 player in the world in that business in the years ahead. But I think we'll -- as I say  it's much more encouraging from an order perspective as we look forward than the first quarter. Ken  do you want to take the cost questions?Ken Bowles: Sure. Welcome back  Lars. It's -- look  it's difficult to strip out the direct impact of the investment program simply because I suppose it's a multiyear program. But within that  if you think about where it's targeted  you're talking about a lot of kind of efficiency from the starting point. So whether it's around quality or uptime or on time in full or delivery or energy  you're kind of attacking the cost base at all aspects of it to kind of get in the right shape. So it's not necessary that you're seeing it in either increased demand or indeed the bottom line directly. It's coming across that equally some cost takeout programs  indeed headcount reductions. So it's throughout the business. I think the overall objective of those has always been to ultimately deliver a more stable to increasing margin which we've done and indeed a rocky attributable target which equally we do. So I think it's difficult to strip it out but it's clearly -- I think it's fair to say it's clearly there. When you look at what Tony talked about earlier on around the stability of the margins and where we are as you kind of begin this next turn of paper price increases in that part of the cycle. On the cost side  it's -- you've been around long enough  Lars. There's a lot of plus minuses but it comes down to price and volume in the end. I suppose  look  if we think about energy for -- if energy was about 120 for the first quarter  it's probably about 150 for the year. We're probably about 60% hedged for the year as we are now. Still a bit to do there with but nothing to worry about  given where energy is kind of setting at the moment. Recovered fiber  as Tony said  the last 6 weeks or so  we've seen a spike in that. Probably at this stage  it's a headwind in the kind of  call it  €100 million to €150 million. Labor  natural inflation leaves you at €100 million. Distribution wood or the raw mats  probably another €80 million or €90 million in that. But our cost takeout program on average a year between €70 million to €80 million will take care of some of that. Energy clearly demand that stays at kind of 2.5%  3%. But equally  then you're left with paper price increases the small part of compression and to Cole's question earlier on  that kind of part of quarter 4  '24. But more importantly  I think as we go into '25  how that begins to play out. But when we look at it in the pluses and minuses  really the headwinds and tailwinds broadly match out and you're left with your incremental piece around demand where box pricing kind of settles to recover as we get through the back half of this year.here or remove ads . 3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com. See disclosureorOperator: And our next question comes from Gaurav Jain from Barclays.Gaurav Jain: A couple of questions from me. So first is just on clearly a very strong result -- set of results in Q1  €487 million EBITDA. And then based on the comments you're making  clearly  it seems  2 it be much stronger. So the full year consensus number is €2 billion. Wouldn't it be fair to assume that there is upside to that? That's one. And the second question is just on M&A in the sector  we are seeing another consolidation and then one of the bidders is no longer there but maybe they are also thinking of something. So with this more consolidated industry  how do you think in the bags  Smurfit going forward?Ken Bowles: I think on the first one  look  I think consensus is you can talk to Ciaran and Frank offline but any aspects of your model you want but I don't think we're going to deal with consensus on this. It is what it is. On the second one  I think -- and Tony and I have a view here  too. In reality  it's an industry that people have been pushing for consolidation to be a good thing for a number of years. I think we've seen more of that over the last few years. I think  look  all we can do  we run our own race. We're not looking at what anybody else is doing. Clearly  our combination with WestRock is very exciting for us  given the cultural alignment  the commercial aspects and the innovation assets of both businesses. So irrespective of the broader consolidation  I think we just focus on our own game in that sense. And we're looking forward to that piece. I don't know  Tony  if you have anything to go forward around consolidation.here or remove ads . 3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com. See disclosureorTony Smurfit: No. I think consolidation has always been happening. There's been always deals happening in the sector. Equally  there's been start-ups and new investments by people. Europe depending on the market is either very fragmented or not fragmented at all. And each market is very different in Europe. The Italian market is different to the U.K. market which is different to the Spanish market which is different to the Swedish market. So overall  generally speaking  M&A in the sector is always happening and will always happen. Sometimes it's small and sometimes it's bigger. It just so happens as our combination with WestRock has probably precipitated the other large M&A transaction out in the marketplace and we wish them well and we'll follow with the interest.Operator: And up next  we have Andrew Jones from UBS.Andrew Jones: Just around the 2Q bridge. Can you just give us some sense of like how much should that sort of small pricing tailwind will have an impact into 2Q? What sort of percentage decline you have in mind? And then just on some of the other aspects about technical guidance and things like that. Have any -- has your thinking changed in any way with regard to any of the parameters you set out at the 4Q stage?Ken Bowles: No  is the short answer to the second one. I mean the guidance for the year kind of remains as it is. On the first one  we don't really do forward guidance. We've never done forward guidance in terms of box pricing  I think it's fair to say what we saw at the year-end. We kind of guided 2% to 2.5% of the box price decline in the first quarter. We've seen that come through with the uptick in paper prices. We're not necessarily seeing any more in that sense. And then we move on to recovery as that kind of paper price feeds through in the back half of this year.here or remove ads . 3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com. See disclosureorOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we now take a follow-up from Cole Hathorn.Cole Hathorn: I've actually had 2 more from my side. The first one is on promotional spending. I mean you should see good benefits when the big consumer brands come back and start their promotional activities. And I'm just wondering how those negotiations are progressing? Are you seeing anything for the Olympics  anything for the football into the summer? Just how you're feeling on kind of the promotional side into the back half of the year? And then the second one  if you can answer it is  obviously  IP and DS Smith have got a $500 million synergy number versus your $400 million for WestRock. You've got good overlap in Mexico. You've got good overlap in Latin America as well as general other synergies. I'm just wondering how comfortable you are with that $400 million number if -- or if there's potential room to the upside?Tony Smurfit: Well  I'll let Ken be the Solomon guy on the synergy number other than to say that we're very comfortable with the number we put into the marketplace and we'll leave it at that. But Ken  I don't know if you want to...Ken Bowles: No  I think that's it. Look  I think you know Smurfit Kappa well. The number we put on the door was the number we were eminently happy with and remain so  Cole.Tony Smurfit: With regard to promotional spending  yes  I mean  obviously  a lot of our customers are talking about the second half of the year. I mean  being stronger for them in regard to promoting their brands. A lot of the big brands were putting price over volume and there has been some backlash against that  as you will have seen in some of the supermarket chains. And so there is likely to be more promotional spending in the second half of the year for the big brands. It's a bit early for us to start calling that out as a big tailwind but we'll wait and see if that actually materializes. With regard to the big events over the summer  they absolutely do use a lot more packaging. So we would be expecting or hoping that  that will be better for the second quarter and into the third quarter with regards to things like the Olympics and the football. We are actually making all the beds for all the athletes in -- not all but all the corrugated beds both in Special Olympics and for the Olympics. So that's an innovation that we -- with a partner we have done. So yes  that's helping a small factory of ours in France. But yes  so it's positive for us but how much those to be seen.here or remove ads . 3rd party Ad. Not an offer or recommendation by Investing.com. See disclosureorOperator: And I would now like to hand the call back over to you  Mr. Smurfit for any additional or closing remarks.Tony Smurfit: Yes. Well  thank you very much  operator and thank you all for joining us today. As always  it's great to talk with you and we're very encouraged by our first quarter. The steps we've taken in Smurfit Kappa and will continue to take  as you'll have seen  built a very good business that consistently delivers over many years. And I would say that the quality and the consistency of that performance gives us increasingly excitement for the future for all of our stakeholders. So with that  I would say thank you again for being with us and we look forward to updating you on progress with the combination with WestRock as we go forward into the next couple of months.

The main index  which consists of the 25 largest companies on the Euronext Amsterdam exchange ,The AEX Index on the Amsterdam stock market broke the 900-point barrier for the first time in history on Tuesday. The main index  which consists of the 25 largest companies on the Euronext Amsterdam exchange  set a new record when it reached the 900.00 euro mark at around 3:10 p.m.The index started the day with a rally from Monday's closing of 891.13  which was the highest closing ever. The level stood at 898.37 at 4:07 p.m.  with trading set to close at 5:30 p.m. Seen as a key indicator of the Amsterdam stock exchange  the AEX Index has made significant progress this year. It started 2024 at 786.82 points.The positive mood on the stock markets is partly caused by the expectation that central banks will start lowering interest rates in 2024. Optimism about the rise of applications in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) is also driving the share prices of the major players in that field. In addition  the economy is performing better than expected  despite the previous sharp interest rate increases by central banks to tackle inflation.The Dutch computer chip industry companies ASMI and ASML have risen sharply this year on expectations of strong demand for powerful chips that can be used in AI applications. ASMI increased in value by more than 30 percent this year  and ASML by about 25 percent. Industry peer Besi is lagging behind with a share price loss of approximately 7 percent this year. Other large AEX companies  such as ING  Shell and Unilever  have also shown strong returns so far.In 2021  the AEX managed to break the 800-point barrier for the first time. On January 24 this year  the Index returned above that level for the first time since the beginning of 2022  and on February 6  the Index broke the closing record from November 2021. When it was founded in 1983  the level of the AEX was 100 points  which was still in guilders at the time. Converted into euros  the starting level was 45.38 points.During the height of the internet boom at the beginning of this century  the AEX broke the 700-point barrier for the first time. However  the price fell sharply after the internet bubble burst  and the AEX reached a low of 218.44 points in March 2003.In the years after 2003  the Index recovered to a peak of 560 points in 2008  just before the devastating financial crisis. The low point of the credit crisis was reached on March 9  2009  with the AEX having fallen to 194.99 points. On February 17  2020  just before the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic reached the Netherlands  the AEX was trading at more than 630 points.But by March 18  the AEX had lost more than a third of its value  falling to 404 points. The AEX Index began its upward climb again in November 2020  after Covid-19 vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna were announced  and the losses during the pandemic were fully recovered by March 2021. The Index trended downward for a year starting that November  and has been steadily on the rise again since November 2023.,neutral,0.01,0.98,0.01,mixed,0.06,0.23,0.71,True,English,"['AEX blue chip index', 'Euronext Amsterdam', '900-point mark', 'first time', 'The Dutch computer chip industry companies', 'previous sharp interest rate increases', 'Other large AEX companies', 'Industry peer Besi', 'Euronext Amsterdam exchange', 'Amsterdam stock market', 'Amsterdam stock exchange', 'internet bubble burst', 'devastating financial crisis', 'share price loss', 'The AEX Index', '25 largest companies', 'interest rates', 'stock markets', 'share prices', 'internet boom', 'credit crisis', '900-point barrier', 'new record', '900.00 euro mark', 'key indicator', 'significant progress', 'positive mood', 'central banks', 'artificial intelligence', 'major players', 'strong demand', 'powerful chips', 'strong returns', '800-point barrier', '700-point barrier', 'a third', 'upward climb', 'Covid-19 vaccines', 'first time', 'main index', 'highest closing', 'closing record', 'low point', 'coronavirus pandemic', 'starting level', 'AI applications', 'history', 'Tuesday', 'rally', 'Monday', 'trading', '786.82 points', 'expectation', 'Optimism', 'rise', 'field', 'addition', 'economy', 'inflation', 'ASMI', 'ASML', 'value', '30 percent', '25 percent', '7 percent', 'Shell', 'Unilever', 'January', 'beginning', 'February', 'November', '100 points', 'guilders', 'euros', '45.38 points', 'height', 'century', '218.44 points', 'March', 'years', 'peak', '560 points', '194.99 points', 'outbreak', 'Netherlands', '630 points', '404 points', 'Pfizer', 'Moderna', 'losses', '3:10', '4:07', '5:30']",2024-05-07,2024-05-07,nltimes.nl

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law. Ipsen’s business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers.
