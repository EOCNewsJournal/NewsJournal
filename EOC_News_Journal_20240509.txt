40589,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rt.com/business/597205-euroclear-russian-frozen-assets/,EU discloses profits from frozen Russian assets,Seizing profits generated by frozen Russian assets would open Pandora’s box and erode investor trust  Euroclear’s CEO has warned  Read Full Article at RT.com,The G7 has reportedly ruled out the total confiscation of the fundsEU clearinghouse Euroclear accrued €1.6 billion ($1.7 billion) in interest from frozen Russian assets in just three months of this year  its CEO Valerie Urbain has revealed. She warned however  that tapping the funds would have a severe impact on global financial markets.The EU is expected to make a decision granting Kiev €2-3 billion in revenue generated by the Russian assets “in the coming weeks ” Urbain said in an interview with the Belgian news outlet L’Echo. Brussels previously suggested seizing the profits to buy weapons for Ukraine rather than using the funds for reconstruction  as had been initially planned.Euroclear  a key intermediary on EU financial markets  has over €200 billion in Russian securities blocked in its accounts  according to company data. Over the past year those accounts have accrued nearly €4.4 billion in interest. The windfall tax on the profits is expected to be between 87% and 89%  according to Urbain.The seizure of the interest income would raise a “question of legal certainty” and have a “very negative impact” not only on Euroclear  but on financial markets worldwide  she warned.“If our clients feel that the law is no longer respected and that their assets may be confiscated  this opens a Pandora’s box ” Urbain told L’Echo. “This could lead large international investors to turn away from Europe.”Euroclear  one of world’s largest providers of cross-border settlements  which holds some €37 trillion in assets  has long opposed Brussels’ plans to tap frozen Russian funds  and its shareholders support that position  Urbain noted. The income linked to Russian activity “must be retained and must not be distributed ” she insisted.The US had been pushing for the outright seizure of the underlying assets in order to fund Ukraine’s government  but has shifted towards taking only the interest amid resistance from France  Germany and the ECB  who worry that the euro could be affected if countries such as China start repatriating their massive foreign reserves as a precaution against their possible confiscation in the future.Officials from G7 states privately said that full confiscation is no longer on the agenda despite Ukrainian demands  Financial Times reported last week.Russia has said that any action taken against its assets would amount to theft and violate international law.,neutral,0.06,0.73,0.21,negative,0.03,0.28,0.69,True,English,"['Russian assets', 'EU', 'profits', 'Belgian news outlet', 'massive foreign reserves', 'large international investors', 'global financial markets', 'EU financial markets', 'EU clearinghouse Euroclear', 'frozen Russian funds', 'Financial Times', 'Russian securities', 'Russian activity', 'The G7', 'total confiscation', 'three months', 'severe impact', 'coming weeks', 'L’Echo', 'key intermediary', 'company data', 'windfall tax', 'legal certainty', 'negative impact', 'largest providers', 'cross-border settlements', 'The US', 'possible confiscation', 'G7 states', 'full confiscation', 'Ukrainian demands', 'international law', 'Russian assets', 'past year', 'Brussels’ plans', 'outright seizure', 'underlying assets', 'Valerie Urbain', 'interest income', 'CEO', 'decision', 'Kiev', 'revenue', 'interview', 'profits', 'weapons', 'Ukraine', 'reconstruction', 'accounts', 'question', 'clients', 'Pandora', 'box', 'Europe', 'world', 'shareholders', 'position', 'government', 'resistance', 'France', 'Germany', 'ECB', 'countries', 'China', 'precaution', 'future', 'Officials', 'agenda', 'action', 'theft']",2024-05-08,2024-05-09,rt.com

The first pay-outs are expected to be made in July.In the previous weeks  several EU member states had objected to the fact that the proceeds are subject to a 25% tax under existing Belgian fiscal rules  which was one of the last stumbling blocks to a deal.EU to discuss compromise text on windfall profits from immobilised Russian assets next week EU member states are converging on a compromise text to use windfall profits from immobilised Russian assets to help Ukraine shoulder the financial cost of fighting Russia as time is pressing to seal the deal before the second half of …Wednesday’s move was made possible by an eleventh-hour compromise whereby Belgium said it would be ready  from 2025 onwards  to channel the tax revenue from the proceeds into a common fund for Ukraine  EU diplomats said.In addition  Brussels also reduced the fee that Euroclear will charge for handling the frozen Russian assets to 0.3% from the initially discussed 0 5% after a push from Germany and France  EU diplomats said.Additionally  the European Central Bank (ECB) would get a role in the management of the emergency buffer created with the fee to pay for lawyers in case of Russian litigation.As a next step  EU finance ministers could rubber stamp the deal at their gathering next Tuesday (14 May).In a separate initiative  G7 leaders meeting at a summit in June are expected to discuss a US-led push that would allow a group of countries to provide up to $50 billion in assistance to Ukraine  with a major part of the aid being repaid with the windfall profits from frozen Russian assets immobilised globally.[Edited by Zoran Radosavljevic]Read more with EuractivRussia targets energy facilities in air attack on Ukraine  officials say A Russian air attack on Ukraine damaged several facilities in a strike targeting energy infrastructure across the country  Ukraine's military and energy officials said on Wednesday (8 May).

Ukraine's recovery and military defence in the context of the Russian aggression "" Belgium  which holds the EU presidency until the end of June  said in a post on X.The United States has proposed seizing the assets in their entirety  but Europe has balked  citing risks to the euro and massive legal repercussions. More recently  Washington has pushed for using the assets as collateral to provide loans for Ukraine.In late April  Russian officials threatened the West with a ""severe"" response and ""endless"" legal challenges if the assets are touched.""There could be no stronger symbol and no greater use for that money than to make Ukraine and all of Europe a safer place to live "" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen posted on X.As part of the deal  EU countries that do not give arms to Ukraine - such as neutral Austria - will abstain from the vote to allocate 90% of the funds to military aid  diplomats said.""We are glad that Austria's concerns were heard and we have reached a political agreement allowing us to constructively abstain "" the Austrian foreign ministry said in a statement.""Austria  as a militarily neutral country  cannot and will not fund or supply lethal material to Ukraine.""EUROCLEARThe EU has estimated that windfall profits from the assets held in the bloc will total between 15 billion and 20 billion euros ($37.6 billion) by 2027.That includes around 3 billion euros ($3.2 billion) this year  the first $1 billion of which could be disbursed as soon as July  von der Leyen previously said.The assets have been gaining exceptional interest because they are stuck  resulting in these so-called windfall profits.Belgium's securities settlement house Euroclear handles the bulk of the assets immobilised in the EU.Three sources  who spoke on condition of anonymity  said Euroclear's management fee would be reduced to 0.3% from 3% to free up more cash for Ukraine.A spokesperson for Euroclear declined to comment.At the end of the first quarter of 2024  Euroclear Bank's balance sheet totalled 199 billion euros  of which 159 billion euros related to the Russian assets  it said in its first-quarter results.Belgium is separately collecting tax on the profits from Euroclear which is set aside for Ukraine.For the fiscal year 2024  Belgium expects to receive 1.7 billion euros  with the bulk already allocated for Ukraine's military.Euroclear said it made 1.6 billion euros in interest from the assets in the first quarter  of which nearly 400 million euros was tax for Belgium.($1 = 0.9305 euro)(Reporting by Julia Payne; additional reporting by Andrew Gray and Huw Jones in London; Editing by Christina Fincher  Paul Simao and Emelia Sithole-Matarise)By Julia Payne",neutral,0.16,0.65,0.19,negative,0.03,0.29,0.69,True,English,"['frozen Russian assets', 'EU envoys', 'profits', 'Ukraine', 'European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen', 'four EU diplomatic sources', 'Russian central bank assets', 'European Union countries', 'Austrian foreign ministry', 'securities settlement house', 'massive legal repercussions', 'endless"" legal challenges', 'other G7 countries', 'The United States', 'Russian financial assets', 'Three sources', 'legal text', 'Russian aggression', 'Russian officials', 'other ways', 'Seven countries', 'EU countries', 'Russian assets', 'Euroclear Bank', 'Belgian government', 'EU-run fund', 'late April', 'severe"" response', 'stronger symbol', 'greater use', 'safer place', 'political agreement', 'neutral country', 'lethal material', 'management fee', 'first quarter', 'balance sheet', 'first-quarter results', 'fiscal year', '400 million euros', 'Julia Payne', 'additional reporting', 'Andrew Gray', 'Huw Jones', 'Christina Fincher', 'Paul Simao', 'Emelia Sithole-Matarise', '$300 billion worth', '20 billion euros', '3 billion euros', '199 billion euros', '159 billion euros', '1.7 billion euros', '1.6 billion euros', 'windfall profits', 'military aid', 'EU presidency', 'exceptional interest', 'neutral Austria', 'military defence', '15 billion', 'BRUSSELS', 'Reuters', 'Ambassadors', 'Wednesday', 'Ukraine', 'Ministers', 'proceeds', 'Kyiv', 'Group', 'Moscow', 'invasion', 'funds', 'money', 'recovery', 'context', 'Belgium', 'June', 'post', 'X.', 'entirety', 'risks', 'Washington', 'collateral', 'loans', 'West', 'part', 'deal', 'arms', 'vote', 'diplomats', 'concerns', 'statement', 'bloc', 'July', 'bulk', 'condition', 'anonymity', 'cash', 'spokesperson', 'tax', 'London', 'Editing', '0.9305']",2024-05-08,2024-05-09,marketscreener.com

However  rather than confiscating the funds entirely  the EU suggested redirecting the interest towards Kiev.Scholz endorsed the proposal made by Josep Borrell  the EU foreign policy chief  who suggested in March to transfer 90% of the revenues from Russian assets frozen in Europe to an EU-managed fund that supports the provision of weapons to Ukraine.He further said that Germany along with the three Baltic states want to see a ramp-up of weapons production in the EU.Over the past two years  the US and its allies have committed billions of dollars in military and financial assistance to Kiev  emphasizing the importance of Moscow experiencing a ""strategic defeat"" in the conflict  while denying any direct involvement in the conflict.Around 70% of Russian assets frozen in Western countries are held in Euroclear  a Belgian-based securities depository  which has the equivalent of approximately $204 billion worth of Russian central bank securities and cash.Moscow has repeatedly denounced the confiscation of Russian assets as ""theft""  asserting that it constitutes expropriation and a breach of international law.Dmitry Peskov  the Kremlin spokesperson  has said that Russia is determined to take all necessary measures to reclaim the seized assets.NEWS LETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address",negative,0.05,0.39,0.57,negative,0.02,0.26,0.71,True,English,"['frozen Russian assets', 'EU proposal', 'Germany', 'arms', 'Ukraine', 'GlobalSecurity.org mailing list', 'German Chancellor Olaf Scholz', 'EU foreign policy chief', 'Russian central bank securities', 'Belgian-based securities depository', 'Iran Press TV', 'three Baltic governments', 'past two years', 'three Baltic states', 'frozen Russian assets', 'United States', 'European Union', 'previous suggestion', 'finance ministry', 'Josep Borrell', 'EU-managed fund', 'financial assistance', 'strategic defeat', 'direct involvement', 'Western countries', '$204 billion worth', 'international law', 'Dmitry Peskov', 'Kremlin spokesperson', 'necessary measures', 'NEWS LETTER', 'Email Address', 'weapons production', 'military capabilities', 'weapons purchases', 'Ukraine war', 'EU proposal', 'interest revenues', 'arms purchases', 'Germany', 'Tuesday', '07 May', 'Monday', 'income', 'Kiev', 'money', 'journalists', 'meeting', 'members', 'Estonia', 'Latvia', 'Lithuania', 'Riga', 'February', 'allies', 'transactions', 'funds', 'March', 'provision', 'ramp-up', 'billions', 'dollars', 'importance', 'Moscow', 'conflict', 'Euroclear', 'equivalent', 'cash', 'confiscation', 'expropriation', 'breach']",2024-05-08,2024-05-09,globalsecurity.org

For more detailed information on the content of the resolutions  please refer to the full notice of the Annual General Meeting and the full proposals that are available on the company's website www.granges.com.Adoption of the income statements and balance sheetsThe General Meeting resolved to adopt the income statement and balance sheet as well as the consolidated income statement and consolidated balance sheet for the 2023 financial year.DividendThe General Meeting resolved  in accordance with the Board of Directors' proposal  on a dividend of SEK 3 per share and that the remaining profits are carried forward. The dividend is to be divided into two payments of SEK 1.50 per payment.The General Meeting resolved that the record date for the first dividend shall be May 13  2024  and the record date for the second dividend shall be November 12  2024. The dividend is expected to be paid out by Euroclear Sweden AB on May 16  2024  and on November 15  2024.Discharge from liabilityThe General Meeting discharged the members of the Board of Directors and the CEO (and the persons holding the positions during 2023) from liability vis-à-vis the company for management of the company in 2023.Board of Directors and auditorThe General Meeting re-elected Fredrik Arp  Steven Armstrong  Mats Backman  Martina Buchhauser  Peter Carlsson and Gunilla Saltin and elected Mikael Bratt and Cecilia Daun Wennborg as Board members. The General Meeting re-elected Fredrik Arp as Chair of the Board.The General Meeting re-elected the registered accounting firm Ernst & Young AB as the company's auditor.The General Meeting resolved that fees payable for the period up to the close of the next Annual General Meeting shall be paid with SEK 890 000 to the Chair of the Board and SEK 375 000 for the other Board members elected by the General Meeting. Remuneration shall be paid with SEK 190 000 for the Chair of the Audit Committee and SEK 80 000 for the other members. Remuneration shall remain unchanged and be paid with SEK 70 000 for the Chair of the Remuneration Committee and SEK 35 000 for the other members. Fees to all the employee representatives of the Board shall remain unchanged at SEK 40 000 each  for the same period.The General Meeting resolved that fees will be paid to the auditor according to approved current account. Resolution on approval of the remuneration reportThe General Meeting resolved  in accordance with the Board of Directors' proposal  to approve the remuneration report on remuneration to the CEO and deputy CEO in accordance with Chapter 8  Section 53 a of the Swedish Companies Act.LTI program for 2024The General Meeting resolved  in accordance with the Board of Directors' proposal  on the adoption of a long-term incentive program in the form of a combination of warrants and restricted share units (""LTI 2024"")  whereby a maximum of 1 000 000 warrants and 500 000 restricted share units may be allotted to senior managers and other key individuals in the Gränges group. LTI 2024 will run for approximately three years.The participants in LTI 2024 can only receive full allotment of restricted share units if the performance targets in the company's annual incentive program  STI 2024  are met and the participant at the same time  for the market value  acquires all warrants that the participant has been offered. Thus  the performance targets for allotment consist partly of financial value creation and sustainability  and partly of the participant making a personal investment of warrants. Thus  there is a clear link between the performance targets and remuneration  and no participant receives any allotment free of charge. In order to make it easier for the participants to make a personal investment  the participants are offered a subsidy corresponding to 50 percent of the premium (""Net Contribution"")  but in order for this to be received  the participant must remain employed at Gränges. If the participant has terminated its employment or been terminated within three years of the payment of the warrant premium  an amount corresponding to the Net Contribution shall be repaid to Gränges. The same applies if the participant has disposed of warrants acquired under LTI 2024 within a period of three years from the payment of the warrant premium. However  the repayment obligation shall be reduced in relation to how long the participant has worked in Gränges during the term of the warrants and in relation to the number of disposed warrants.Each warrant shall entail a right to subscribe for one (1) new share in the company at a subscription price established by the company  or by an independent appraiser or auditor firm retained by the company  corresponding to 115 percent of the volume weighted average price of the company's share on Nasdaq Stockholm during the ten (10) trading days immediately preceding the offer to subscribe for warrants  however not less than the quota value of the shares. The restricted share units are subject to vesting periods that will run over the period June 2024  to ten (10) trading days from the date of publication of the interim report for the period January - March 2025  2026 and 2027 respectively with one third of the restricted share units vesting per year. Payments relating to the restricted share units take place at the end of the vesting periods and no later than June 30  2025  2026 and 2027  and will only be made to participants who  at the time of the payment  haven't terminated or been terminated from their employment  provided that no local laws or regulations exist entitling participants to payouts.Based on the number of shares and votes in the company as of the date of the notice to the General Meeting  the dilution as a result of LTI 2024  assuming that all warrants are exercised for subscription of shares  will be approximately 0.9 per cent of both the shares and the votes. The restricted share units will not result in any dilution.The board of directors has the right to decide that participants  instead of being offered warrants  shall be offered the opportunity of a similar cash-based alternative. In order to hedge the financial exposure and the other possible risks that arise from the introduction of LTI 2024  the General Meeting resolved to authorize the Board of Directors to enter into one or more share swap agreements with third parties on one or more occasions on market terms.Issue authorizationThe General Meeting resolved  in accordance with the Board of Directors' proposal  to authorize the Board of Directors to  on one or more occasions until the next Annual General Meeting  issue new shares and/or convertible bonds. An issue of new shares and/or convertible bonds can be decided with or without regard to shareholders' pre-emption rights. The number of shares issued  or which may be issued by conversion of convertible bonds issued pursuant to the authorization  may correspond to a maximum of 10 percent of the total number of shares in the company after utilization of the authorization.

In February the clearing house reported €4.4 billion interest on the Russian funds and forecast that the Belgian government would reap €1.085 billion in taxes.The final amount for Ukraine has yet to be confirmed  but should be available in July.READ MOREThe EU – wary of the legal ramifications of seizing the entire cache of Russian assets – decided it could give the profits to Ukraine  after concluding Moscow had no legal right to these funds. But finding a deal has been complicated by divisions about how to spend the money  Euroclear’s management fees and Belgium’s 25 per cent tax on corporate profits.Belgium has now said it is “prepared to consider” a voluntary plan to transfer the collected taxes to Ukraine from 2025  according to diplomatic sources. The Belgian climbdown was first reported by Politico.The Belgian state is already contributing aid to buy weapons for Ukraine  but other EU countries argued the Russian windfall should be additional to – not instead of – Belgium’s regular Ukraine aid. One EU diplomat had described the profits as “a windfall tax for Belgium” and said: “It is a little unfair because nobody else has Russian money to pay for their aid for Ukraine.”Meeting on Wednesday  the diplomats also whittled Euroclear’s management fee to 0.3 per cent  down from the original 3 per cent proposed.EU member states decided that 90 per cent of the windfall profits would go on weapons for Ukraine and remaining 10 per cent on non-lethal aid  a split designed to assuage countries including Ireland  Austria and Hungary that cannot or do not wish to fund arms.“EU ambassadors agreed in principle on measures concerning extraordinary revenues stemming from Russia’s immobilised assets ” Belgium’s EU presidency said on X . “The money will serve to support #Ukraine‘s recovery and military defence in the context of the Russian aggression.”Welcoming the agreement  the European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen  said on X: “There could be no stronger symbol and no greater use for that money than to make Ukraine and all of Europe a safer place to live.”The EU deal opens the door to a broader discussion in the G7 about using Russia’s frozen billions of assets  but many European nations  including Germany and France  are wary of a US plan to take charge of the assets  fearing a violation of international law.Separately on Wednesday EU ambassadors began talks on plans to restrict the flow of Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG) via Europe  as part of a 14th round of sanctions against the Kremlin’s ability to wage war.The European Commission wants to impose restrictions on the trans-shipment of LNG in the EU to stop Russia exporting the highly lucrative gas to non-EU countries via EU ports. The EU also wants to ban new investment  goods and services to build LNG terminals in the Russian Arctic. The proposals  however  stop short of a ban on Russian LNG  which unlike most pipeline gas has continued to be imported into the EU.EU diplomats hope to get agreement on the latest sanctions before the European elections and certainly in advance of July 1st  when the Russia-friendly Hungarian government takes over the bloc’s rotating presidency. – Guardian,neutral,0.06,0.7,0.24,negative,0.04,0.27,0.7,True,English,"['EU', 'deal', 'profits', 'Russia', 'assets', 'Ukraine', 'Ursula von der Leyen', 'Russian liquefied natural gas', 'Russian Central Bank assets', 'EU senior diplomats meeting', 'new investment, goods', 'most pipeline gas', 'The European Union', 'European Commission president', 'many European nations', 'The European Commission', 'Russia-friendly Hungarian government', 'One EU diplomat', 'EU member states', 'original 3 per cent', '25 per cent tax', 'other EU countries', '€4.4 billion windfall profits', 'regular Ukraine aid', 'lucrative gas', 'European elections', 'windfall tax', '0.3 per cent', '90 per cent', 'Russian windfall', '€4.4 billion interest', 'Belgian government', 'Russian aggression', 'Russian Arctic', 'EU diplomats', 'Russian assets', 'EU ambassadors', 'EU presidency', 'EU ports', 'management costs', 'clearing house', 'western governments', 'final amount', 'legal ramifications', 'entire cache', 'legal right', 'management fees', 'voluntary plan', 'diplomatic sources', 'Belgian climbdown', 'Belgian state', 'extraordinary revenues', 'military defence', 'stronger symbol', 'greater use', 'safer place', 'broader discussion', 'frozen billions', 'US plan', 'international law', '14th round', 'rotating presidency', 'Russian funds', 'Russian LNG', 'frozen assets', 'Russian money', 'corporate profits', 'non-lethal aid', 'LNG terminals', 'latest sanctions', 'July 1st', 'EU deal', '10 per', 'weapons', 'months', 'Wednesday', 'compromise', 'dispute', 'taxation', 'Belgium', 'country', 'Euroclear', 'Brussels', 'response', 'invasion', 'February', 'taxes', 'READ', 'Moscow', 'divisions', 'Politico', 'split', 'Ireland', 'Austria', 'Hungary', 'arms', 'principle', 'measures', 'recovery', 'context', 'agreement', 'door', 'G7', 'Germany', 'France', 'charge', 'violation', 'talks', 'plans', 'flow', 'part', 'Kremlin', 'ability', 'war', 'restrictions', 'trans-shipment', 'services', 'proposals', 'advance', 'bloc', 'Guardian']",2024-05-08,2024-05-09,irishtimes.com

CEO Valerie Urbain cautioned against accessing these funds  citing the potential for severe repercussions on global financial markets.Amidst deliberations within the European Union regarding the fate of these assets  Urbain disclosed that Brussels is expected to decide on granting Kiev EUR2-3 billion in revenue generated by the Russian assets in the near future. Initially earmarked for reconstruction efforts  there are now proposals to utilize the funds to procure weapons for Ukraine  reflecting shifting priorities amidst escalating tensions.Euroclear  a pivotal player in European Union financial markets  holds over EUR200 billion in Russian securities in its accounts  with accumulated interest over the past year amounting to nearly EUR4.4 billion. Despite the substantial windfall  Urbain cautioned that any move to seize these profits would raise concerns about legal certainty and could precipitate adverse effects on Euroclear and financial markets globally.Expressing apprehension about the potential fallout  Urbain emphasized the importance of upholding legal integrity to maintain investor confidence. Any perception of asset confiscation could prompt significant international investors to divest from European markets  undermining stability and investor trust.Furthermore  Euroclear's stance against tapping into the profits linked to Russian activity reflects broader shareholder sentiment and underscores the company's commitment to preserving financial stability.

Brussels agrees to send €3bn from frozen Russian assets to aid Ukraine,Since the full-scale invasion of 2022  €210 billion in assets of the Moscow central bank have sat frozen within the bloc – chiefly at the Euroclear depositary in Belgium. The deal was agreed “in principle” at a regular meeting of national ...,Diplomats agreed the controversial plans at a meeting on Wednesday – but some say they don’t go far enough.ADVERTISEMENTEU diplomats agreed Wednesday to use income from frozen Russian state assets to aid Ukraine – paving the way for the war-torn country to get around €3 bn for arms purchases and reconstruction before the summer.Since the full-scale invasion of 2022  €210 billion in assets of the Moscow central bank have sat frozen within the bloc – chiefly at the Euroclear depositary in Belgium.The deal was agreed “in principle” at a regular meeting of national representatives  according to a tweet by Belgium  currently chairing talks in the European Council.Brussels has long touted using the interest from those funds  estimated at around €3bn per year  for Ukraine’s reconstruction costs – and later extended its plans to cover Kyiv’s military expenditure.The plan – which also has backing from the group of seven leading industrialised democracies – comes as Ukraine hopes to turn the tide in an increasingly desperate military campaign  bolstered by €89bn recently agreed by the US Congress.But Ukrainian ministers have said Brussels needs to go further than merely scooping up interest payments – and fully confiscate Moscow’s assets to ensure the aggressor pays for the cost of war.Officials from EU countries and the European Central Bank have expressed concerns that seizing assets outright might set an unhelpful precedent or harm the euro’s reputation as a safe currency.Talks were also held up by concerns over how many of the assets would be retained by Euroclear as an administration fee  a figure that was originally as high as 13%  as well as Belgium’s right to tax the profits gained by the Brussels-based securities depository.Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo has already promised to send some €1.5bn directly to Ukraine  though that appears to be a result of applying existing corporate tax law to the unexpected windfall Euroclear gains by having frozen central bank assets on its books.The final deal allows Euroclear to keep a provisional buffer worth 10% of the profits  in case of litigation over the funds. It can also keep 0.3% as an incentive  while 90% of the funds will be sent via the European Peace Facility to help Ukraine buy weapons.Commission President Ursula von der Leyen previously suggested Ukraine could receive the first funds under the mechanism by July – but the calculation will be backdated to February  when Euroclear formally segregated the assets.Ambassadors today also formally agreed on the reforms Ukraine will have to make to receive funds from a separate €50bn facility of EU grants and loans.UPDATE (8 May  17:00 CET): adds clarification regarding litigation buffer.,neutral,0.21,0.77,0.02,mixed,0.08,0.23,0.7,True,English,"['frozen Russian assets', 'EU Policy', 'Brussels', 'Ukraine', 'Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo', 'Commission President Ursula von der Leyen', 'seven leading industrialised democracies', 'existing corporate tax law', 'unexpected windfall Euroclear gains', 'Brussels-based securities depository', 'separate €50bn facility', 'European Central Bank', 'European Peace Facility', 'desperate military campaign', 'Moscow central bank', 'Russian state assets', 'central bank assets', 'European Council', 'military expenditure', 'war-torn country', 'arms purchases', 'full-scale invasion', 'national representatives', 'US Congress', 'Ukrainian ministers', 'EU countries', 'unhelpful precedent', 'safe currency', 'administration fee', 'provisional buffer', 'EU grants', 'Euroclear depositary', 'controversial plans', 'EU diplomats', 'regular meeting', 'reconstruction costs', 'interest payments', 'final deal', 'litigation buffer', 'first funds', 'Wednesday', 'ADVERTISEMENT', 'income', 'Ukraine', 'way', 'summer', 'bloc', 'Belgium', 'principle', 'tweet', 'talks', 'year', 'Kyiv', 'group', 'tide', 'aggressor', 'Officials', 'concerns', 'reputation', 'figure', 'right', 'profits', 'result', 'books', 'case', 'incentive', 'weapons', 'mechanism', 'July', 'calculation', 'February', 'Ambassadors', 'reforms', 'loans', 'UPDATE', 'May', '17:00 CET', 'clarification', '€3', '0.']",2024-05-08,2024-05-09,euronews.com

Stahl AG / Key word(s): Quarterly / Interim Statement/Quarter ResultsR. STAHL sales and order intake at a high level in the first quarter of 202408.05.2024 / 07:30 CET/CESTThe issuer is solely responsible for the content of this announcement.R. STAHL sales and order intake at a high level in the first quarter of 2024At € 92.3 million  order intake in the first quarter of 2024 were close to the extremely high level of the previous year (€ 96.7 million) and significantly higher than the figure for the fourth quarter of 2023 (€ 74.5 million).Sales up 8.5% year-on-year to € 84.7 million from January to March.One-time items push profitability below the strong figure from the previous year EBITDA pre exceptionals decreased from € 10.4 million in the previous year to € 8.4 million in the first three months of 2024. This resulted in an EBITDA margin pre exceptionals of 9.9% (previous year: 13.3 %).For 2024  R. STAHL expects sales to increase to between € 335 million and € 350 million and EBITDA pre exceptionals of between € 35 million and € 40 million.Waldenburg  10 May 2024 – R. STAHL got off to a strong start in financial year 2024. Demand for the company’s products and services picked up again in nearly all regions and sectors in the first quarter of 2024  after development in the fourth quarter of 2023 was somewhat subdued.Order intake of € 92.3 million at a high level – order backlog increases to € 122.0 millionThe increased willingness on the part of customers to invest led to an order intake of € 92.3 million from January to March 2024. Although this figure was down 4.6% on the high prior-year figure of € 96.7 million  it was significantly higher than the order volume for the fourth quarter of 2023 (€ 74.5 million). While the order situation in the Central region (Africa  Europe not including Germany) remained virtually unchanged in the first quarter compared to the previous year  the order volume in Germany (-10.6%)  the Americas(-6.2%) and Asia/Pacific (-7.3%) fell. Order intake from the chemical industry in particular slowed compared to the previous year. There was positive momentum from all other customer sectors  however. As a result of the overall good demand in the first three months of 2024  order backlog increased to € 122.0 million as of 31 March (31 December 2023: € 115.1 million).International regions push 8.5% growth in sales to € 84.7 millionEasing bottlenecks in supply chains led to higher utilization of production capacities in the first quarter of 2024. The key sales drivers included orders from the nuclear sector  shipbuilding and the oil industry. Overall  R. STAHL increased its sales by 8.5% to € 84.7 million from January to March 2024. The main contributors to this increase were the Americas region with growth of 26.4% and the Central region (Africa  Europe not including Germany) with growth of 18.2%. Sales in Germany  on the other hand  declined slightly (-8.1%)  while sales in Asia/Pacific remained virtually unchanged (+1.2%).At € 8.4 million  EBITDA pre exceptionals was below the previous year’s strong figure of € 10.4 million due to high one-time itemsDespite an increase in the company's total operating performance  EBITDA pre exceptionals decreased from € 10.4 million in the previous year to € 8.4 million in the period from January to March 2024. This was mainly due to one-time items resulting from the implementation of the EXcelerate strategy program and higher personnel costs  mainly due to collective bargaining agreements. Profitability as measured by the EBITDA margin pre exceptionals decreased from the extraordinarily strong figure of 13.3% in the previous year to 9.9%. Net profit decreased from € 3.9 million to € 2.1 million. This corresponds to earnings per share of € 0.33 (previous year: € 0.60).The increased volume of business from January to March led to an increase in inventories and thus to an increase in working capital of € -7.4 million. This was  however  below the previous year’s figure of € -15.3 million. This had a positive impact on free cash flow  which at € -4.3 million was € 4.4 million higher than in the previous year (Q1 2023:€ -8.7 million). The equity ratio of 25.1% was slightly improved (31 December 2023: 25.0%).Good first quarter 2024 confirms outlook for full-year 2024For 2024  the company expects further growth in the relevant key markets based on the overall economic and industry-specific forecasts.The high order backlog that R. STAHL started 2024 with  as well as the good demand in the first quarter of 2024  mean that the company can look ahead to full-year 2024 with careful optimism. The Executive Board expects Group sales to grow to between € 335 million and € 350 million (2023: € 330.6 million).Profitability in the current financial year should stabilize at around the very good level of the previous year. A high level of investment for additional growth  increasing price sensitivity on the part of customers as well as rising personnel costs are likely to have a temporary negative impact on earnings development. The Executive Board expects EBITDA pre exceptionals to be between € 35 million and € 45 million in 2024 (2023: € 38.6 million). In terms of free cash flow  R. STAHL expects a medium single-digit positive million euro amount in 2024 (2023: € 0.3 million).“There was a noticeable recovery in demand for R. STAHL products in the first quarter. This makes us confident that  with the strategy we are pursuing  we will continue to grow and generate stable earnings in 2024”  says Dr. Mathias Hallmann  CEO of R. STAHL.Key figures of R.

The output of the future power station will be equivalent to the consumption of more than 700 000 inhabitants.The project revenues will come from a 30-year power sales contract with STEG (Société Tunisienne de l'Électricité et du Gaz)  the operator of the Tunisian public grid.Tunisia targets to achieve a renewable energy electricity production rate of 30% by 2030  versus 2.2% in 2023. In a country with more than 300 days of sunshine a year  solar is particularly competitive in comparison to thermal power plants relying mostly on imported natural gas. On the other hand  the country is particularly exposed to climate change due to the size of its climate-dependent agriculture and its high level of urbanisation potentially prone to flooding.Construction is scheduled to start in 2025 and commissioning is expected in 2026.Sébastien Clerc  CEO of Voltalia  said: ""We are delighted to have won this project. Thanks to attractive climate conditions  supportive governmental policies and strong support from international financial institutions  Tunisia has a great renewable energy potential in the short and long term.""Next on the agenda: Annual General Meeting  May 16  2024About Voltalia ( www.voltalia.com ) Voltalia is an international player in renewable energies.

(NYSE and TASE: TEVA)  and Medincell (Euronext: MEDCL)  today announced results from the efficacy portion of the Phase 3 Subcutaneous OLAnzapine extended-Release Injection Study (SOLARIS) trial evaluating TEV-‘749 in adult patients with schizophrenia compared to placebo. Results demonstrated that TEV-‘749 met its primary endpoint as measured by a change in the PANSS total score from baseline after 8 weeks compared to placebo. TEV-‘749 utilizes SteadyTeq™  a copolymer technology proprietary to Medincell that provides a controlled steady release of olanzapine  the most prescribed 2nd generation antipsychotic for schizophrenia in the U.S.1TEV-‘749 met its primary endpoint across all three dosing groups  with mean difference in change in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score from baseline to week 8 of -9.71 points  -11.27 points  and -9.71 points versus placebo for the high  medium  and low dose groups  respectively. These differences from placebo were clinically meaningful and statistically significant with adjusted P-values of <0.001 for each comparison. Key secondary endpoints of CGI-S (Clinical Global Impressions – schizophrenia) and PSP (Personal and Social Performance Scale) total score were also statistically significant after adjusting for multiplicity. No cases of PDSS have been reported to date  after administration of approximately 80% of the target injection number.An estimated 3.5 million people are currently diagnosed with schizophrenia in the U.S. It is a chronic  progressive  and severely debilitating mental disorder that affects how one thinks  feels and behaves. Currently  there is no long-acting olanzapine treatment option available for schizophrenia that does not risk post-injection delirium/sedation syndrome (PDSS). PDSS is characterized by the sudden and unexpected onset of delirium or sedation within the first several hours of receiving treatment and has been associated with the intramuscular injection of long-acting olanzapine.“These encouraging results from the efficacy portion of our Phase 3 SOLARIS trial demonstrate the potential of TEV-‘749 to be an effective long-acting treatment option for schizophrenia and further show our dedication to advancing innovative science in mental health and beyond ” said Eric Hughes  MD  PhD  Executive Vice President of Global R&D and Chief Medical Officer at Teva. “Schizophrenia can be a devastating disease for both the people struggling with it as well their families. Schizophrenia is often a chronic life-long disease  but by using medication consistently  people can find the treatment help they deserve. This also has the potential to reduce the burden for not only themselves  but their caregivers and loved ones as well.”___________________________________1 NPA TRx - MAT Jan 2024; schizophrenia factors sourced from 2022 Analytics Link (IQVIA)View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240508942555/en/,neutral,0.01,0.98,0.01,negative,0.01,0.26,0.73,True,English,"['Positive Phase 3 Efficacy Results', 'Monthly Subcutaneous Long-Acting Injectable', 'SOLARIS Trial', 'Teva', 'Medincell', 'olanzapine', 'Once', 'Adults', 'Schizophrenia', '749', 'Phase 3 Subcutaneous OLAnzapine extended-Release Injection Study', 'effective long-acting treatment option', 'Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd', 'acting olanzapine treatment option', 'subcutaneous long-acting injection', 'target injection number', 'TEV-‘749 dose groups', 'Negative Syndrome Scale', 'post-injection delirium/sedation syndrome', 'additional safety data', 'COMPLETE PRESS RELEASE', 'controlled steady release', '2nd generation antipsychotic', 'three dosing groups', 'low dose groups', 'Key secondary endpoints', 'Clinical Global Impressions', 'Social Performance Scale', 'first several hours', 'Executive Vice President', 'Global R&D', 'Chief Medical Officer', 'debilitating mental disorder', 'Phase 3 SOLARIS trial', 'chronic life-long disease', 'U.S. affiliate', 'PANSS) total score', 'PANSS total score', 'schizophrenia symptom severity', 'intramuscular injection', 'U.S.1', 'chronic, progressive', 'mental health', 'devastating disease', 'primary endpoint', 'significant reductions', 'assessment tool', 'long-term follow-up', 'copolymer technology', 'efficacy portion', 'adult patients', 'mean difference', 'unexpected onset', 'innovative science', 'Eric Hughes', '1 NPA TRx', '2022 Analytics Link', 'source version', 'Teva Pharmaceuticals', 'SteadyTeq™ technology', '3.5 million people', 'encouraging results', 'schizophrenia factors', 'meaningful', 'placebo', 'Positive', 'incidence', 'PDSS', 'date', 'part', 'monthly', 'use', 'Medincell', 'ACCESS', 'NYSE', 'TASE', 'Euronext', 'MEDCL', 'change', 'baseline', '8 weeks', '9.71 points', 'differences', 'P-values', 'comparison', 'CGI-S', 'PSP', 'Personal', 'multiplicity', 'cases', 'administration', 'sudden', 'potential', 'dedication', 'MD', 'PhD', 'families', 'medication', 'burden', 'caregivers', 'loved', 'MAT', 'IQVIA', 'businesswire']",2024-05-08,2024-05-09,marketscreener.com

A whole  strategic approach to wellness spanning the entire care journey is cited as vital. The report  the first in a series on various disease states  is accompanied by a webinar that highlights the importance of empathetic and inclusive patient education that makes the patient part of the care team.Click here to download the report and view the webinar.“Despite the progress made in modern medicine  cardiovascular disease (CVD) continues to be the leading cause of death worldwide ” said Holly Urban  MD  vice president of strategy for Clinical Effectiveness  Wolters Kluwer Health. “Yet  only about 10-20% of a patient’s health is affected by medical care  with the remainder impacted by social drivers of health.”“To help prevent CVD  lower healthcare costs  and improve outcomes  healthcare professionals—from administrators to frontline staff—must adopt a unified  enterprise approach that puts the focus on the patient across the continuum of care ” Urban added.The impact of CVD is also critical for health plans. Payers have focused on CVD with increased measures – such as controlling high blood pressure – tied to Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) scores which evaluate the quality of payers  particularly Medicare plans.The report also addresses:The need to identify risks that lead to CVD comorbidities including tobacco use and unhealthy diets that can be linked to hypertension and diabetes. The report highlights that many patients don’t receive a timely diagnosis of diabetes  often delayed until after they have a cardiac event.The importance of providing updated clinical content at the point of care to help providers keep the focus on the patient and lessen time searching for answers.How consistent care and clinical information resources across the healthcare system support a system-wide approach.Treating the patient as part of the care team and encouraging shared decision making to help deliver high-quality care.“Impactful patient education across all patient demographics is critical to healthcare providers battling CVD ” added Urban. “Holistic education that meets the patient where they are and provides  engaging  evidence-based content can lead to better outcomes.”The UpToDate® Point of Care report series provides insights for healthcare leaders on transforming care  unifying teams  and driving better outcomes for patients and healthcare organizations. The support of clinical decisions based on current evidence as a prerequisite for appropriate treatment in terms of quality  patient safety and cost-effectiveness is also discussed. In fact  numerous professional groups in healthcare benefit from the evidence-based knowledge provided by resources such as UpToDate  including doctors  nurses  pharmacists  and other clinicians.For more information about Wolters Kluwer  please visit: www.wolterskluwer.com.About Wolters KluwerWolters Kluwer (EURONEXT: WKL) is a global leader in information  software solutions and services for professionals in healthcare; tax and accounting; financial and corporate compliance; legal and regulatory; corporate performance and ESG.

EMEA reported the largest decline  driven by Meeting Experience due to inventory destocking by major customers  and by softer demand in Entertainment  partly linked to a weak movie slate in Cinema. In Americas double digit order growth in Enterprise stood in contrast with a reduction in orders in Entertainment  where we saw lower order intake for Cinema-as-a-Service compared to last year. In APAC  orders were essentially flat for Enterprise  but were lower for Healthcare and Entertainment. With a positive book-to-bill ratio  the orderbook for the Group strengthened to 524.8 million euro.Sales declined 21% versus the same quarter last year  led by EMEA. In Americas  sales declined primarily in Entertainment  while Diagnostic Imaging and Control Rooms grew. In EMEA the sales decline was driven by customers working off above average inventory levels in Meeting Experience and Healthcare and by soft demand in Entertainment  both in Cinema and Immersive Experience. APAC was also impacted by the inventory correction in Healthcare and by soft demand in Immersive Experience.FORMTEXT Quote of the CEO's  An Steegen & Charles Beauduin FFFFFFFF00000000140005005400650078007400330000002200510075006F007400650020006F00660020007400680065002000430045004F002C00200043006800610072006C0065007300200042006500610075006400750069006E0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000""The first quarter of 2024 was marked by an anticipated inventory destocking by our customers in Meeting Experience and Healthcare  which is expected to be largely completed by mid-year. In Entertainment  demand was hampered by the aftermath of the strikes in the North-American film industry  and customers delaying orders in anticipation of our new product launches. Barco has a broad funnel of new product introductions in all its divisions  which form a solid foundation for resumption of our growth from the second semester. We continue to invest in our innovation pipeline of breakthrough visualization technologies in preparation for more new product introductions in 2025. We also continue to strengthen our competitive cost position through our focused factories strategy  including the opening of the new Entertainment plant in China  which is due to start commercial production in the second quarter.""Outlook 2024 FFFFFFFF00000000140005005400650078007400390000000C004F00750074006C006F006F006B002000320030003200340000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000The following statements are forward looking on a like-for-like basis and actual results may differ materiallyIn 2024  there is continued macro-economic and market condition uncertainty  which is reducing our visibility. We assume a return to normalized customer inventory levels  and we are on track with the planned new product launches over the course of the year.Management expects topline for the full year to be in line with 2023  with year-over-year growth resuming in the second half of the year. From 2025  we expect topline growth on a full year basis.The EBITDA margin is expected to be above 14% for the full year 2024.Divisional breakdownHealthcare(in millions of euro) 1Q24 1Q23 Change 1Q24 vs 1Q23 Orders 59.1 69.5 -15% Sales 64.9 73.9 -12%Sales and order intake for Healthcare were down 12% and 15% respectively  versus the same quarter last year.Diagnostic Imaging had one of its strongest first quarters over the past years. Regionally  sales grew most in the Americas region  which had a strong performance in both radiology and mammography. We also see the emergence of new disciplines such as teleradiology and digital pathology. Demand in APAC was somewhat softer  mainly in China  which is still contending with above average customer inventories. The anti-bribery actions in the Chinese healthcare sector  which started during the second half 2023  are gradually becoming the ""new normal"" compliance process  comparable with other countries  which will be beneficial for Barco in the future. Diagnostic Imaging launched ""DL Precise"" for breast imaging  the first AI commercial application on our AI ecosystem platform. More important new product introductions are expected  such as home reading radiology displays in the second quarter  and the new flagship display for mammography in the second half of the year.In Surgical and Modality elevated customer inventories continue to impede the implementation of confirmed contracts for new platforms. Management expects inventory digestion to be largely completed toward the second half of the year. The book-to-bill ratio was above one  with an important uptake of orders in the Americas. The portfolio and product mix are shifting towards software and embedded software.Enterprise(in millions of euro) 1Q24 1Q23 Change 1Q24 vs 1Q23 Orders 52.2 62.4 -16% Sales 48.6 68.8 -29%Enterprise orders were 16% lower than last year  while sales were 29% lower year-over-year. While Meeting Experience's topline was impacted by customers destocking inventories  Control Rooms[1] posted growth  despite the discontinuation of activities in certain geographies to create focus and improve profitability.Meeting Experience took in strong orders and sales in the last quarter of 2023  driven by channel partners anticipating changes in the terms of Barco's partner programs. As a result  inventories at several channel partners  primarily in EMEA  were higher than normal for the first quarter. Management expects the digestion of this inventory to continue into the second quarter of 2024. Meanwhile  the sell-through of ClickShare from distributors to resellers and end-customers declined by a mid-single-digit figure year-over-year  consistent with the overall performance of the meeting room market  which remained soft. Hence ClickShare maintained its market share. First orders have been received for the ClickShare Bar  contributing to the positive book-to-bill for the quarter.Control Rooms sales grew year-over-year in all regions  delivering on the high orderbook that was built up in 2023 and some projects that had been delayed. The orderbook remains high and the order intake contained a growing number of orders for the new Barco CTRL software platform  which is targeted at specific industry verticals  and is reflecting our increased focus on software and services.Entertainment(in millions of euro) 1Q24 1Q23 Change 1Q24 vs 1Q23 Orders 108.8 154.6 -30% Sales 82.4 104.3 -21%The performance of the Entertainment division was impacted by economic and industry headwinds and a comparison against a strong 1Q23 when the business was still catching up from the supply chain constraints of the year before.Cinema's orders declined as customers' investment appetite softened due to a delayed movie slate following the strikes in the Hollywood film industry in 2023  most notably in EMEA. In contrast  APAC delivered growth in orders  primarily in China where local content is gaining share. Last year  Cinema received exceptionally large orders under a multi-year Cinema-as-a-Service contract in the first and fourth quarters  which did not occur at the same level in the first quarter of 2024. The delivery on this frame contract continues in full swing  with further large call-off orders expected. Barco launched its HDR Lightsteering technology commercially  following the roadshows and demonstrations of the technology to selected audiences last year. Commercial pilot programs with major exhibitors are planned for the last quarter of this year.Immersive Experience faced various headwinds. The rental market saw lower demand  as rental partners are slowing down orders  after having grown their portfolio significantly following the pandemic and the subsequent supply chain shortages. Orders and sales for fixed installations were temporarily hampered  as customers are anticipating the launch of several new products. Barco's simulation business continued to perform strong in all regions  most pronounced in the Americas. From a regional perspective  Immersive Experience sales were more resilient in the Americas  and declined most in EMEA  mainly in Western Europe  and to a lesser extent in APAC  where the Chinese market remains slow. Management expects a gradual improvement in sales and orders across geographies over the course of 2024  fueled by several new product introductions.

(Yangzhou  China). The vessels are expected to be delivered in the fourth quarter of 2026 and have been chartered to a strong counterparty for 10 years upon delivery from the shipyard. The vessels will have dual-fuel green methanol engines that are ready to be retrofitted for future operation on ammonia.Dry-bulk vesselsEuronav concluded an order for an additional two Newcastlemaxes for delivery in the first half of 2027. This brings the total Newcastlemax fleet to 4 ships on the water and 24 on order for delivery in 2024-2027.Container vesselsOn 12 February 2024  CMB.TECH  in partnership with Yara Clean Ammonia  North Sea Container Line  and Yara International  announced the commissioning of the world's first ammonia-powered container ship  Yara Eyde. This pioneering vessel  constructed at Qingdao Yangfan Shipbuilding  marks a significant milestone in decarbonising shipping  operating on clean ammonia between Norway and Germany. Owned by Delphis  a division of CMB.TECH  and operated by NCL Oslofjord AS  this collaboration sets a new standard for sustainable maritime transport.SalesCrude oil tankers3 N-class vessels sold: Euronav has sold the VLCC Nectar (2008 - 307 284 DWT)  VLCC Newton (2009 - 307 208 DWT)  and VLCC Noble (2008 - 307 284 DWT). Delivery of the vessels is expected during Q2 2024 and a capital gain of approximately USD 82.7 million will be booked.The remaining 13 VLCC's were delivered to Frontline. The total capital gain in Q1 amounted to USD 372.7 million.Newbuilding deliveriesCrude oil tankersOn 6 February 2024  the Company took delivery of Suezmax Bristol (2024 - 156 851). Dry-bulk vesselsOn 18 March Euronav & CMB.TECH took delivery of the fourth super-eco Newcastlemax Mineral France (2024 - 210 000 DWT).Update - Newbuilding delivery scheduleOutstanding capital expenditure for the 57 vessels currently under construction at the end of Q1 2024 was USD 2.908 billion  split as follows: USD 924.2 million in 2024  USD 910.0 million in 2025  USD 913.0 million in 2026 and USD 233.7 million in 2027.TANKER MARKET & OUTLOOKEuronav - Tanker MarketsFrom the demand-side perspective  global oil demand has remained resilient through the first few months of 2024. The International Energy Agency (IEA) has recently revised the 2024 global oil demand upwards by +110kb/d  projecting a continued growth trajectory. Anticipated figures indicate a rise of +1.3 mb/d in 2024 and +1.1 mb/d in 2025. Furthermore  there is sustained growth expected in tonne-mile crude oil trade  with projections indicating a 4.3% increase in 2024 and a 2.5% increase in 2025 - mainly driven by US oil exports hitting an all-time high in mid-April 2024.Crude oil tanker supply-side remains supportive even after the recent increase in tonnage orders for both VLCC and Suezmax vessels. The order book remains below historic averages  with 5.1% VLCC and 13.8% Suezmax vessels on order. The supply-side is further supported by the aging global fleet. By 2026  approximately 25% of the fleet is expected to be over 20 years old  posing operational and efficiency challenges.Market participants are closely monitoring geopolitical tensions for potential disruptions to oil supply routes. This has led to increased geopolitical risk premiums and a 'buy and fix first' attitude  shifting some power to owners. Long-term positive sentiment is mainly driven by supply-side dynamics - keeping interest rates high for longer  while any reversal from OPEC+ production cuts would increase rates further.Q2 2024 spot rates to-date: so far 63% fixed at 49 465 USD per day for VLCCs and 54% fixed at 41 841 USD for Suezmaxes.Bocimar - Dry-Bulk MarketsThe dry bulk demand side is characterised by sustained growth in tonne-mile trade  with projections indicating a 2.1% increase in 2024 and a 1.3% increase in 2025. Notably  China's GDP growth is expected to be 5.0% in 2024 and 4.1% in 2025  driving demand in the region.Supply-side is characterised by a historical low order book  with an order book-to-fleet ratio of only 5.9% for the Capesize fleet. In addition  the supply-side is further supported by ageing vessels. By 2027  70% of Capesize vessels are expected to be over 15 years old.Historically high earnings have been observed in Q1 2024 for Capesizes  fuelled by increased activity in the Atlantic and rising Chinese imports. Positive sentiment continues  driven by supply-side dynamics and optimism in freight futures markets. The futures curve continues to steepen  with the May contract now trading some 30% above spot  supporting the belief that rates will continue to recover for the rest of the year and beyond. In addition  recent Newcastlemax orders in China are rumoured to be USD 80 million with delivery in 2028 - confirming the value of Bocimar's newbuild Newcastlemax fleet (total vessels of 10 end Q4 2024  19 vessels end 2025 and 28 vessels end Q1 2027).Q2 2024 spot rate so far: 55% fixed 37 063 USD per day.Delphis - Container MarketsThe container market anticipates growth in TEU tonne-mile of 5.5% in 2024  and 0.9% in 2025. The container trade volume growth is forecasted 3.6% in 2024  and 3.9% in 2025.Container shipping markets are much improved versus late 2023 amid ongoing (temporary) supply-demand impacts from the rerouting of vessels away from the Red Sea. Growing demand is largely offset by the historically high expected fleet growth. The box fleet will grow by 11.0% in 2024  and 4.9% in 2025. The order book-to-fleet ratio stands at 25% in 2024.6 000 and 1 400 TEU container vessels are all employed under 10 to 15-year time charter contract.Bochem - Chemical MarketsThe fundamentals of demand in the chemical tanker market are mainly driven by global GDP growth (3.1% in 2024  and 3.2% 2025). In addition  growth in tonne-mile is projected at 4.2% increase in 2024  driven by healthy demand growth supported by increased volumes of products being transported over longer distances. The increase in tonne miles is further supported by (temporary) disruptions to the Panama and Suez Canal  but supply chain disruptions also affect volumes transported.The order book to fleet ratio is 5.5% of the current core chemical tanker fleet and ~ 20% of the fleet is currently 20 years or older. The supply-side is further supported by the limited swing tonnage due to a favourable product tanker market.25 000 DWT chemical tankers are employed under 10-year time charter (4 vessels) and in the spot pool (2 vessels).Windcat - Offshore Wind MarketsThe substantial upfront costs of building a wind farm without an attractive energy rate provided by governments means developers and operators are choosing to delay or cancel projects wherever possible. These project delays have led to a short-term decrease in fixed-bottom installations forecast for 2024 and 2025  but potential energy rate increases offered by government authorities should lead to strong growth in installations towards the end of the decade as projects reach FID. In addition  improvements in the offshore oil & gas investment environment contribute to demand. Windcat CTVs and CSOVs are flexible to be employed in either offshore wind  and/or offshore oil & gas industry.The Q1 2024 demand for proven  low-emission offshore wind vessels to support construction and operations across the Europe offshore market has been supportive - driving the utilisation levels of the CTV fleet to 80.1% for Q1  and 85.4% for the rest of the year.Constraints in fleet supply remain supportive of market conditions  with limited availability of capable (future proof) crew transfer and construction support vessels.CTV employment contracts consist out of a mix of spot contracts and long-term time charter commitments.DISTRIBUTION TO SHAREHOLDERSThe Supervisory Board decided to amend the dividend policy to a fully discretionary dividend policy.Full Year 2023 DividendThe Supervisory Board has proposed to the Annual Shareholders' Meeting on 16 May 2024 to distribute USD 4.57 per share to all shareholders. This payout in cash is proposed as a combination of a dividend (USD 0.27 per share) and a repayment from the share issue premium (USD 4.30 per share). This distribution approach will be optimal for shareholders as the share issuance payment part of the distribution will represent more than 90% of the distribution. This distribution is exempt from any withholding tax.The proposed timing for the dividend  subject to the approval of the AGM on 16 May  are as follows:Ex-dividend date: 22/05/2024Record date: 23/05/2024Payment date: 31/05/2024Q1 2024 DividendThe Supervisory Board has decided it will make a proposal to a Special Shareholders' Meeting in July to distribute USD 1.15 per share to all shareholders. This payout in cash is proposed as a combination of a dividend and a repayment from the share issue premium which is optimal for shareholders as described above.SUSTAINABILITY UPDATEFirst hydrogen production and refuelling station in AfricaOn May 2  2024  Cleanergy Solutions Namibia (a joint venture between CMB.TECH and the Ohlthaver & List Group) welcomed His Majesty the King of the Belgians and His Excellency dr. Nangolo Mbumba  President of the Republic of Namibia to Cleanergy's hydrogen production and refuelling station in Walvis Bay  Namibia.

CMB.TECH offers hydrogen and ammonia fuel that it either produces or sources from external producers to its customers.CMB.TECH is active throughout the full hydrogen value chain through four different divisions: Marine  Technology & Development  H2 infra  and Industry. The value creation of the new strategy is driven by CMB.TECH's ""future-proof"" (or low carbon emitting) fleet of 106 low carbon vessels  of which 46 are under construction. The Transaction fitted into the Company's renewed strategy of diversification  decarbonisation and accelerated optimisation of the Company's fleet.Opening and closing mandatory takeover bidOn February 14  2024  the Company announced the launch of the mandatory public takeover bid by CMB on all the shares in Euronav. The acceptance period in respect of the bid opened on 14 February 2024 and closed on 15 March 2024. The bid price amounts to USD 17.86 per share in cash  i.e. USD 18.43 per share less USD 0.57 dividend per share.On 18 March 2024  the Company confirmed that the acceptance period of the mandatory public takeover bid launched by CMB NV (the ""Bidder"") for all shares issued by Euronav NV (""Euronav"") not already owned by CMB or its affiliates (the ""Bid"")  expired on March 15  2024.

This will allow quick identification of new safety information. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions.Indications: Treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome as an add-on therapy to other anti-epileptic medicines for patients 2 years of age and older. Dosage and Administration: Please refer to SmPC for full information. Should be initiated and supervised by physicians with experience in the treatment of epilepsy. Fintepla is prescribed and dispensed according to the Fintepla controlled access programme. Dravet syndrome: Patients who are not taking stiripentol: Starting dose is 0.1 mg/kg twice daily (0.2 mg/kg/day). After 7 days  if tolerated  can increase dose to 0.2 mg/kg twice daily (0.4 mg/kg/day). After an additional 7 days  if tolerated and further seizure reduction required  can increase dose to a maximum of 0.35 mg/kg twice daily (0.7 mg/kg/day)  which is the recommended maintenance dose. Patients requiring more rapid titration may increase the dose every 4 days. Do not exceed maximum daily dose of 26 mg (13 mg twice daily). Patients who are taking stiripentol: Starting dose is 0.1 mg/kg twice daily (0.2 mg/kg/day). After 7 days  if tolerated  can increase dose to 0.2 mg/kg twice daily (0.4 mg/kg/day)  which is the recommended maintenance dose. Patients requiring more rapid titration may increase the dose every 4 days. Do not exceed a total dose of 17 mg (8.6 mg twice daily). Lennox-Gastaut syndrome: Starting dose is 0.1 mg/kg twice daily (0.2 mg/kg/day). After 7 days  the dose should be increased to 0.2 mg/kg twice daily (0.4 mg/kg/day)  if tolerated. After an additional 7 days  if tolerated  dose should be increased to 0.35 mg/kg twice daily (0.7 mg/kg/day)  which is the recommended maintenance dose. Do not exceed maximum daily dose of 26 mg (13 mg twice daily). Discontinuation: When discontinuing treatment  decrease the dose gradually. As with all anti-epileptic medicines  avoid abrupt discontinuation when possible to minimize the risk of increased seizure frequency and status epilepticus. A final echocardiogram should be conducted 3-6 months after the last dose of treatment with fenfluramine. Renal impairment: Generally  no dose adjustment is recommended when administered to patients with mild to severe renal impairment  however  a slower titration may be considered. If adverse reactions are reported  a dose reduction may be needed. Has not been studied in patients with end-stage renal disease. Not known if fenfluramine or its active metabolite  norfenfluramine  is dialyzable. Hepatic impairment: Hepatic impairment: Generally  no dose adjustment is recommended when Fintepla is administered without concomitant stiripentol to patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A and B). In patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) not receiving concomitant stiripentol  the maximum dosage is 0.2mg/kg twice daily  and the maximal total daily dose is 17 mg. There are limited clinical data on the use of Fintepla with stiripentol in patients with mild impaired hepatic function. A slower titration may be considered in patients with hepatic impairment and a dose reduction may be needed if adverse reactions are reported. No clinical data is available on the use of Fintepla with stiripentol in moderate and severe hepatic impairment  therefore not recommended for use. Elderly: No data available. Pediatric population: Safety and efficacy in children below 2 years of age not yet established. No data available. Contraindications: Hypersensitivity to active substance or any excipients. Aortic or mitral valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension. Within 14 days of the administration of monoamine oxidase inhibitors due to an increased risk of serotonin syndrome. Warnings and Precautions : Aortic or mitral valvular heart disease and pulmonary arterial hypertension: Prior to starting treatment  patients must undergo an echocardiogram to establish a baseline and exclude any pre-existing valvular heart disease or pulmonary hypertension. Conduct echocardiogram monitoring every 6 months for the first 2 years and annually thereafter. If an echocardiogram indicates pathological valvular changes  consider follow-up earlier to evaluate whether the abnormality is persistent. If pathological abnormalities seen on echocardiogram  evaluate the benefit versus risk of continuing fenfluramine treatment with the prescriber  caregiver and cardiologist. Once treatment is discontinued for any reasons  a final echocardiogram should be conducted 3-6 months after the last dose of treatment with fenfluramine. If echocardiogram findings suggestive of pulmonary arterial hypertension  perform a repeat echocardiogram as soon as possible and within 3 months to confirm these findings. If echocardiogram finding is confirmed suggestive of an increased probability of pulmonary arterial hypertension defined as intermediate probability  conduct a benefit-risk evaluation of continuation of Fintepla by the prescriber  carer and cardiologist. If echocardiogram suggests a high probability  it is recommended fenfluramine treatment should be stopped. Decreased appetite and weight loss: Fenfluramine can cause decreased appetite and weight loss - an additive effect can occur in combination with other anti-epileptic medicines such as stiripentol. Monitor the patient's weight. Undertake risk-benefit evaluation before starting treatment if history of anorexia nervosa or bulimia nervosa. Fintepla controlled access programme: A controlled access programme has been created to 1) prevent off-label use in weight management in obese patients and 2) confirm that prescribing physicians have been informed of the need for periodic cardiac monitoring in patients taking Fintepla. Somnolence: Fenfluramine can cause somnolence which could be potentiated by other central nervous system depressants. Suicidal behaviour and ideation: Suicidal behaviour and ideation have been reported in patients treated with anti-epileptic medicines in several indications. Advise patients and caregivers to seek medical advice should any signs of suicidal behaviour and ideation emerge. Serotonin syndrome: Serotonin syndrome  a potentially life-threatening condition  may occur with fenfluramine treatment  particularly with concomitant use of other serotonergic agents; with agents that impair metabolism of serotonin such as MAOIs; or with antipsychotics that may affect the serotonergic neurotransmitter systems. Carefully observe the patient  particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases. Increased seizure frequency: A clinically relevant increase in seizure frequency may occur during treatment  which may require adjustment in the dose of fenfluramine and/or concomitant anti-epileptic medicines  or discontinuation of fenfluramine  should the benefit-risk be negative. Cyproheptadine: Cyproheptadine is a potent serotonin receptor antagonist and may therefore decrease the efficacy of fenfluramine. If cyproheptadine is added to treatment with fenfluramine  monitor patient for worsening of seizures. If fenfluramine treatment is initiated in a patient taking cyproheptadine  fenfluramine's efficacy may be reduced. Glaucoma: Fenfluramine can cause mydriasis and can precipitate angle closure glaucoma. Discontinue therapy in patients with acute decreases in visual acuity. Consider discontinuation if ocular pain of unknown origin. Effect of CYP1A2 or CYP2B6 inducers: Co-administration with strong CYP1A2 inducers or CYP2B6 inducers will decrease fenfluramine plasma concentrations  which may lower the efficacy of fenfluramine. If co-administration is considered necessary  the patient should be monitored for reduced efficacy and a dose increase of fenfluramine could be considered provided that it does not exceed twice the maximum daily dose (52 mg/day). If a strong CYP1A2 or CYP2B6 inducer is discontinued during maintenance treatment with fenfluramine  consider gradual reduction of the fenfluramine dosage to the dose administered prior to initiating the inducer. Effect of CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitors: Initiation of concomitant treatment with a strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitor may result in higher exposure and  therefore  adverse events should be monitored  and a dose reduction may be needed in some patients. Excipients: Contains sodium ethyl para-hydroxybenzoate (E 215) and sodium methyl para-hydroxybenzoate (E 219) - may cause allergic reactions (possibly delayed). It also contains sulfur dioxide (E 220) which may rarely cause severe hypersensitivity reactions and bronchospasm. Patients with rare glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. The product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per the maximum daily dose of 12 mL; essentially 'sodium-free'. Contains glucose - may be harmful to teeth. Interactions: Pharmacodynamic interactions with other CNS depressants increase the risk of aggravated central nervous system depression. An increase in dose may be necessary when coadministered with rifampicin or a strong CYP1A2 or CYP2B6 inducer. In in vitro studies co-administration with a strong CYP1A2 or CYP2D6 inhibitor may result in higher exposure (see section 4.4 of the SmPC). Co-administration with CYP2D6 substrates or MATE1 substrates may increase their plasma concentrations. Co-administration with CYP2B6 or CYP3A4 substrates may decrease their plasma concentrations. Pregnancy and lactation: Limited data in pregnant women. As a precaution  avoid use of Fintepla in pregnancy. It is unknown whether fenfluramine/metabolites are excreted in human milk. Animal data have shown excretion of fenfluramine/metabolites in milk. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from Fintepla taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. Drive and use machines.: Fintepla has moderate influence on the ability to drive/ use machines as it may cause somnolence and fatigue. Advise patients not to drive or operate machinery until they have sufficient experience to gauge whether it adversely affects their abilities. Adverse effects : Dravet syndrome:Very common (≥1/10): Upper respiratory tract infection  decreased appetite  somnolence  diarrhoea  pyrexia  fatigue  blood glucose decreased  echocardiogram abnormal (Consisted of trace and mild mitral regurgitation  and trace aortic regurgitation  which are considered physiologic). Common (≥1/100 to <1/10): Bronchitis  abnormal behaviour  aggression  agitation  insomnia  mood swings  ataxia  hypotonia  lethargy  seizure  status epilepticus  tremor  constipation  salivary hypersecretion  weight decreased and blood prolactin increased. Not known (cannot be estimated from the available data): Pulmonary arterial hypertension.

(Pharming or the Company) (Euronext Amsterdam: PHARM / Nasdaq: PHAR) presents its preliminary (unaudited) financial report for the three months ended March 31  2024.Chief Executive Officer  Sijmen de Vries commented: Pharming delivered a strong first quarter  increasing quarterly revenues by 31% year-over-year to US$55.6 million and keeping the Company on track for our 2024 total revenue guidance of US$280 - US$295 million. This revenue growth was driven primarily by the U.S. commercial launch of Joenja ®  and we also delivered continued strong RUCONEST ® revenue growth and new patient enrollments as well as the first material named patient program revenues for leniolisib for patients outside of the U.S.We now have 83 patients on Joenja ® paid therapy in the U.S.  with additional patients enrolled and pending  and a further 138 patients globally are on leniolisib therapy through one of our access programs or ongoing clinical trials. We have increased our focus on finding additional APDS patients through a combination of genetic testing  family testing  and Variant of Uncertain Significance (VUS) resolution efforts. The VUS resolution work seeks to confirm additional genetic variants that cause APDS and thereby diagnose additional patients from amongst the over 1 100 patients in the U.S. who have received such inconclusive VUS genetic testing results to date. All of these efforts have now begun to increase the number of identified APDS patients in the U.S.  and we anticipate providing further updates in the near future on our progress in the U.S. and globally.here or remove ads . 3rd party Ad.

See disclosureorWe continue to be very active with regulatory agencies worldwide in our efforts to make Joenja ® (leniolisib) available to patients in as many markets as possible  and continue to prepare for the commercialization of leniolisib in additional key global markets this year. Just last week Joenja ® received regulatory approval in Israel  further demonstrating the product's positive clinical benefit. In addition  the increasing number of requests for individual treatment on a named patient basis we are receiving reflects the unmet medical need for APDS patients outside of the U.S.With the recent completion of enrollment in the leniolisib clinical trial for children aged 4 to 11  we are also progressing towards regulatory filings worldwide for pediatric approval  beginning in 2025.In addition  we are working to expand the leniolisib market opportunity through clinical development for larger primary immunodeficiency (PID) disorders. Our team has made significant progress towards commencing a Phase II proof of concept clinical trial in PIDs with immune dysregulation linked to PI3KáºŸ signaling. We are now also preparing a clinical development plan for an additional PID indication  and look forward to providing further updates after obtaining regulatory feedback.Finally  following the end of the quarter  we completed a successful refinancing by issuing €100 million in new convertible bonds due in 2029 to repurchase the majority of our €125 million convertible bonds due in 2025.

Over 730 of these globally identified patients are in the U.S.  Europe  the U.K.  Japan  Asia Pacific  Middle East  and Canada  key markets for Pharming with estimated total prevalence of ~2000 APDS patients.Pharming continues to advance several initiatives to diagnose additional APDS patients  including a sponsored genetic testing program in the U.S.  partnerships with several genetic testing companies who undertake their own testing efforts  and family testing programs. Pharming's Variant of Uncertain Significance (VUS) resolution efforts are ongoing  including validation studies with various laboratories to confirm which VUSs should be classified as APDS. As results become available  patients with validated variants could be diagnosed with APDS and  therefore  potentially be eligible for Joenja ® treatment. Completion of these studies is expected during the fourth quarter of 2024.In the U.S. market  the number of diagnosed APDS patients increased by 15 during the first quarter 2024  including a few patients diagnosed via VUS resolution  bringing the number of identified patients in the U.S. to over 220.Leniolisib highlights - regulatory  clinical and commercial strategy updatesLeniolisib for APDSPharming made continued progress in the first quarter of 2024 on leniolisib regulatory filings for APDS patients 12 years of age and older in key global markets.

The single-arm  open-label  multinational clinical trials will evaluate the safety  tolerability and efficacy of leniolisib in approximately 15 children  per clinical trial  who have a confirmed APDS diagnosis. The primary efficacy endpoints and secondary endpoints of the studies mirror those used to evaluate the clinical outcomes in the previous leniolisib Phase II/III APDS trials for patients aged 12 and older.Pharming announced completion of enrollment in the clinical trial for children ages 4 to 11 years old on April 8  2024. Pharming plans to include data from this 4“11-year-old trial in regulatory filings worldwide for the approval of leniolisib for pediatric patients with APDS  beginning in 2025.In November 2023  the first patient was dosed in the clinical trial for children ages 1 to 6 years old. Enrollment in the study is continuing as planned.Leniolisib for additional indications (PI3KÎ´ platform) - Primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) beyond APDSPharming plans an initial Phase II  proof of concept  clinical trial in targeted PID genetic disorders with immune dysregulation linked to PI3KáºŸ signaling in lymphocytes  with similar clinical phenotypes and unmet medical need to APDS. These PID disorders include ALPS-FAS  CTLA4 haploinsufficiency and PTEN deficiency. The epidemiology of these targeted PID genetic disorders suggests a prevalence of approximately five patients per million.The Phase II clinical trial is a single arm  open-label  dose range-finding study to be conducted in approximately 12 patients. The objectives for the trial will be to assess safety and tolerability  pharmacokinetics  pharmacodynamics  and explore clinical efficacy of leniolisib in this new PID population.

(“Pharming” or “the Company”) (Euronext Amsterdam: PHARM / Nasdaq: PHAR) presents its preliminary (unaudited) financial report for the three months ended March 31  2024.Chief Executive Officer  Sijmen de Vries commented:“Pharming delivered a strong first quarter  increasing quarterly revenues by 31% year-over-year to US$55.6 million and keeping the Company on track for our 2024 total revenue guidance of US$280 - US$295 million. This revenue growth was driven primarily by the U.S. commercial launch of Joenja®  and we also delivered continued strong RUCONEST® revenue growth and new patient enrollments as well as the first material named patient program revenues for leniolisib for patients outside of the U.S.We now have 83 patients on Joenja® paid therapy in the U.S.  with additional patients enrolled and pending  and a further 138 patients globally are on leniolisib therapy through one of our access programs or ongoing clinical trials. We have increased our focus on finding additional APDS patients through a combination of genetic testing  family testing  and Variant of Uncertain Significance (VUS) resolution efforts. The VUS resolution work seeks to confirm additional genetic variants that cause APDS and thereby diagnose additional patients from amongst the over 1 100 patients in the U.S. who have received such inconclusive VUS genetic testing results to date. All of these efforts have now begun to increase the number of identified APDS patients in the U.S.  and we anticipate providing further updates in the near future on our progress in the U.S. and globally.We continue to be very active with regulatory agencies worldwide in our efforts to make Joenja® (leniolisib) available to patients in as many markets as possible  and continue to prepare for the commercialization of leniolisib in additional key global markets this year. Just last week Joenja® received regulatory approval in Israel  further demonstrating the product’s positive clinical benefit. In addition  the increasing number of requests for individual treatment on a named patient basis we are receiving reflects the unmet medical need for APDS patients outside of the U.S.With the recent completion of enrollment in the leniolisib clinical trial for children aged 4 to 11  we are also progressing towards regulatory filings worldwide for pediatric approval  beginning in 2025.In addition  we are working to expand the leniolisib market opportunity through clinical development for larger primary immunodeficiency (PID) disorders. Our team has made significant progress towards commencing a Phase II proof of concept clinical trial in PIDs with immune dysregulation linked to PI3Kẟ signaling. We are now also preparing a clinical development plan for an additional PID indication  and look forward to providing further updates after obtaining regulatory feedback.Finally  following the end of the quarter  we completed a successful refinancing by issuing €100 million in new convertible bonds due in 2029 to repurchase the majority of our €125 million convertible bonds due in 2025. These transactions strengthen our financial position while enhancing flexibility for the continued execution of our business strategy over the next several years.”First quarter highlightsCommercialized assetsRUCONEST® marketed for the treatment of acute HAE attacksRUCONEST® continued to perform well in the first quarter of 2024  with revenues of US$46.0 million  an 8% increase compared to the first quarter of 2023.The U.S. market contributed 97% of first quarter revenues  while the EU and Rest of World contributed 3%.In the U.S. market  we saw continued strength in underlying in-market demand for RUCONEST®  including almost 70 new patient enrollments in the first quarter. We achieved strong overall performance in leading key revenue indicators including new physicians prescribing RUCONEST®  new patient enrollments  and the total number of patients.Joenja® (leniolisib) marketed in the U.S. – the first and only approved disease modifying treatment for APDSJoenja® revenues increased to US$9.6 million in the first quarter of 2024  a 21% increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. This increase was mostly driven by higher volume from the continued increase in patients on paid therapy in the U.S. and revenues from EU and Rest of World.As of March 31  2024  we have 83 patients on paid therapy in the U.S. and an additional five patients enrolled and pending authorization.EU and Rest of World revenues are from product provided on a named patient basis. Pharming has named patient and other funded early access programs whereby physicians can request leniolisib on behalf of individual patients living with APDS  who meet the eligibility criteria and receive local health authority approval  in certain countries where leniolisib is not commercially available.APDS patient findingAs of December 31  2023  Pharming had identified over 840 diagnosed APDS patients of all ages in global markets  including over 200 patients in the U.S. Of the identified patients in the U.S.  approximately 75% are 12 years of age or older  the majority of whom are currently eligible for treatment with Joenja®. Over 730 of these globally identified patients are in the U.S.  Europe  the U.K.  Japan  Asia Pacific  Middle East  and Canada  key markets for Pharming with estimated total prevalence of ~2000 APDS patients.Pharming continues to advance several initiatives to diagnose additional APDS patients  including a sponsored genetic testing program in the U.S.  partnerships with several genetic testing companies who undertake their own testing efforts  and family testing programs. Pharming’s Variant of Uncertain Significance (VUS) resolution efforts are ongoing  including validation studies with various laboratories to confirm which VUSs should be classified as APDS. As results become available  patients with validated variants could be diagnosed with APDS and  therefore  potentially be eligible for Joenja® treatment. Completion of these studies is expected during the fourth quarter of 2024.In the U.S. market  the number of diagnosed APDS patients increased by 15 during the first quarter 2024  including a few patients diagnosed via VUS resolution  bringing the number of identified patients in the U.S. to over 220.Leniolisib highlights - regulatory  clinical and commercial strategy updatesLeniolisib for APDSPharming made continued progress in the first quarter of 2024 on leniolisib regulatory filings for APDS patients 12 years of age and older in key global markets. In addition  Pharming progressed ongoing clinical trials to support regulatory filings for approval in Japan and pediatric label expansion.Pharming’s strategy is to expand the commercial availability of leniolisib for APDS patients to key markets in Europe  U.K.  Japan  Asia Pacific  Middle East  and Canada. Pharming intends to market leniolisib directly in most of these markets following regulatory approval.In total  there are currently 138 patients on leniolisib therapy as part of an Expanded Access Program (compassionate use)  an ongoing clinical study  or a named patient program.European Economic Area (EEA)Pharming is working closely with the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) Committee for Human Medicinal Products (CHMP) to address the remaining outstanding issues on the Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA) for leniolisib. We are now awaiting the CHMP’s opinion on the leniolisib MAA.United KingdomOn March 12  2024  Pharming submitted a MAA for leniolisib with the U.K. Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)  through the International Recognition Procedure (IRP) on the basis of the U.S. FDA approval. The MAA for leniolisib was validated on April 17  2024. The MHRA has 110 days from the date the IRP submission is validated  with an optional clock stop at Day 70 to provide time for applicants to prepare responses to a potential request for further information  to review and issue its decision.Additional markets - Canada  Australia  IsraelPharming filed regulatory submissions in Canada and Australia in the third quarter of 2023  and Israel in the second quarter. We anticipate regulatory action in 2024 for Canada and in 2025 for Australia.The Israeli Ministry of Health granted Marketing Authorization for Joenja® (leniolisib) for the treatment of APDS in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older on April 30  2024. Pharming has an agreement with Kamada Ltd.  an Israel-based commercial stage global biopharmaceutical company with a portfolio of marketed products for rare and serious conditions focused on diseases of limited treatment alternatives  to commercialize Joenja® in Israel. Pharming anticipates the commercial launch of Joenja® in Israel in 2025  following completion of government payor negotiations that typically conclude in December.Pediatric clinical developmentIn 2023  Pharming initiated two pediatric clinical trials  for children ages 4 to 11 and ages 1 to 6 years old  at sites in the U.S.  Japan and the EU. The single-arm  open-label  multinational clinical trials will evaluate the safety  tolerability and efficacy of leniolisib in approximately 15 children  per clinical trial  who have a confirmed APDS diagnosis. The primary efficacy endpoints and secondary endpoints of the studies mirror those used to evaluate the clinical outcomes in the previous leniolisib Phase II/III APDS trials for patients aged 12 and older.Pharming announced completion of enrollment in the clinical trial for children ages 4 to 11 years old on April 8  2024. Pharming plans to include data from this 4–11-year-old trial in regulatory filings worldwide for the approval of leniolisib for pediatric patients with APDS  beginning in 2025.In November 2023  the first patient was dosed in the clinical trial for children ages 1 to 6 years old. Enrollment in the study is continuing as planned.Leniolisib for additional indications (PI3Kδ platform) - Primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) beyond APDSPharming plans an initial Phase II  proof of concept  clinical trial in targeted PID genetic disorders with immune dysregulation linked to PI3Kẟ signaling in lymphocytes  with similar clinical phenotypes and unmet medical need to APDS. These PID disorders include ALPS-FAS  CTLA4 haploinsufficiency and PTEN deficiency. The epidemiology of these targeted PID genetic disorders suggests a prevalence of approximately five patients per million.The Phase II clinical trial is a single arm  open-label  dose range-finding study to be conducted in approximately 12 patients. The objectives for the trial will be to assess safety and tolerability  pharmacokinetics  pharmacodynamics  and explore clinical efficacy of leniolisib in this new PID population. The trial has been designed to inform a subsequent Phase III program. Pharming is in the final stages of preparation for the start of the trial.Pharming has also prioritized development of leniolisib for an additional PID indication. Pharming will provide further updates and details on our plans after obtaining regulatory feedback on the proposed clinical development plan.OTL-105Consistent with Pharming’s current strategy as well as prioritization of clinical development expansion of leniolisib into additional PID indications  Pharming has decided to terminate the research collaboration & licensing agreement with Orchard Therapeutics and discontinue the OTL-105 program.Subsequent event - convertible bond refinancingOn April 18  2024  Pharming announced the placement of €100 million of senior unsecured convertible bonds due 2029 (the “New Bonds”) convertible into new and/or existing ordinary shares in the capital of the Company (the ""Shares""). The New Bonds were issued at par and carry a coupon of 4.50% per annum payable semi-annually in arrear in equal installments on April 25 and October 25 of each year  commencing on October 25  2024. Unless previously converted  redeemed or purchased and cancelled  the New Bonds will be redeemed at par on April 25  2029. The initial conversion price has been set at €1.2271  representing a premium of 37.5% above the volume weighted average price (VWAP) of a Share on Euronext Amsterdam between opening of trading on the launch date and the pricing of the offering (i.e. €0.8924).Pharming used the net proceeds of the New Bonds for the repurchase of €123.1 million of the outstanding €125 million 3.00% senior unsecured convertible bonds due 2025 issued on January 21  2020 (the “2025 Bonds”; ISIN: XS2105716554)  to strengthen its financial position while enhancing flexibility for the continued execution of its business strategy over the next several years. Settlement of the New Bonds took place on April 25  2024  and settlement of the repurchase of the 2025 bonds took place on April 26  2024.Financial summaryAmounts in US$m except per share data 1Q 2024 1Q 2023 Consolidated Statement of Income Revenue - RUCONEST® 46.0 42.5 Revenue - Joenja® 9.6 0.0 Total Revenues 55.6 42.5 Cost of sales (8.4) (4.0) Gross profit 47.2 38.5 Other income 0.3 0.6 Research and development (18.5) (15.6) General and administrative (15.1) (10.1) Marketing and sales (30.2) (27.1) Operating profit (loss) (16.3) (13.7) Other finance income 1.8 0.1 Other finance expenses (1.6) (2.8) Share of net profits in associates using the equity method (0.5) (0.3) Profit (loss) before tax (16.6) (16.7) Income tax credit (expense) 4.2 4.5 Profit (loss) for the period (12.4) (12.2) Share Information Basic earnings per share (US$) (0.019) (0.019) Diluted earnings per share (US$) (0.019) (0.019)Amounts in US$m March 31  2024 December 31  2023 Consolidated Balance Sheet Cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash and marketable securities 203.5 215.0 Current assets 296.6 316.3 Total assets 441.7 462.9 Current liabilities (excluding convertible bonds) 72.4 76.1 Equity 205.9 218.8Financial highlightsTotal revenues for the first quarter of 2024 increased by 31% to US$55.6 million compared to US$42.5 million in the first quarter of 2023. RUCONEST® revenues amounted to US$46.0 million  an 8% increase compared to the first quarter of 2023. The volume increase in the U.S. and a U.S. price increase in line with CPI were the primary factors behind this increase in RUCONEST® revenues. Joenja® revenues amounted to US$9.6 million in the first quarter of 2024  a 21% increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. This increase in Joenja® revenues was mostly driven by an increase in volume. Total revenues per operating and reportable segment for the period ended March 31  2024 and 2023 are:Amounts in US$ millions 1Q 2024 1Q 2023 RUCONEST® Joenja® Total RUCONEST® Joenja® Total Revenues US 44.8 8.5 53.3 40.9 — 40.9 Europe and RoW 1.2 1.1 2.3 1.6 — 1.6 Total revenues 46.0 9.6 55.6 42.5 — 42.5Gross profit increased by 23% to US$47.2 million (1Q 2023: US$38.5 million)  mainly due to the increase in revenues. This was partially offset by non-recurring inventory impairments amounting to US$2.3 million.The operating loss amounted to US$16.3 million compared to an operating loss of US$13.7 million in the first quarter of 2023. This was mainly due to an expected increase in operating expenses from US$52.7 million in the first quarter of 2023 to US$63.9 million in the first quarter of this year. This increase was caused by a combination of continuing investments in Joenja® in the U.S.  launch preparation for leniolisib outside of the U.S.  increasing R&D investments to expand the leniolisib franchise and increased payroll expenses due to business growth.The Company had a net loss of US$12.4 million  compared to a net loss of US$12.2 million in the first quarter of 2023. The change was mainly due to the increase in revenues  offset by an increase in operating expenses.Negative cash flows from operations amounted to US$7.6 million  compared to US$22.8 million in the first quarter of 2023. Cash and cash equivalents  including restricted cash and marketable securities  decreased by US$11.5 million to US$203.5 million from US$215.0 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2023.On 5 October 2023  Orchard Therapeutics Plc. (Orchard) announced it had entered into a definitive agreement with Japanese company Kyowa Kirin Co. LTD for the acquisition of Orchard. During the first quarter for 2024  Pharming has received US$2.0 million in cash for its shares held in Orchard.Outlook/SummaryFor 2024  the Company anticipates:Total revenues between US$280 million and US$295 million (14% to 20% growth)  with quarterly fluctuations expected.Continued progress finding additional APDS patients in the U.S.  supported by family testing and VUS validation efforts  and subsequently converting patients to paid Joenja® (leniolisib) therapy.Increasing ex-U.S. revenues leniolisib - from commercial availability or through our Named Patient Program and other funded early access programs in key global markets.Completion of leniolisib clinical trials to support regulatory filings for approval in Japan and pediatric label expansion in key global markets.Progress towards regulatory approvals for leniolisib in the EEA  the U.K.  Canada and Australia.Initiate and advance a Phase II clinical trial for leniolisib in PIDs with immune dysregulation linked to PI3Kδ signaling to significantly expand the long-term commercial potential of leniolisib.Continued operating cost investments to accelerate future revenue growth. Our current cash on hand and the continued cash flow from product revenues are expected to be sufficient to fund these investments.

The Annual Report 2023 is available at the Company's website (www.amg-nv.com).

Agenda item 2.b.

In accordance with article 2:135b subsection 2 of the Dutch Civil Code  the Remuneration Report for the 2023 financial year will be submitted to the General Meeting for its advisory vote. Agenda item 2.c. Discussion of dividend policy (discussion item) In 2021 the Management Board  with the approval of the Supervisory Board  amended the dividend policy given the intrinsic volatility AMG has experienced in some of its markets  as follows: given that AMG has cyclical elements in its product mix and that it desires to have a relatively consistent dividend pay-out  the revised policy will allow for stable dividend pay-outs and target gradual increases to historic dividend levels  provided that such pay-outs and possible increases are supported by AMG's liquidity and cash flow generation  and subject to prevailing statutory requirements. Agenda item 3.a. Adoption of the 2023 financial statements (voting item) It is proposed to the General Meeting to adopt the Financial Statements of AMG for the financial year 2023.

The Financial Statements have been audited by KPMG Accountants N.V. and were approved by the Supervisory Board in its meeting of February 21  2024. Agenda item 3.b. Proposal to resolve upon (final) dividend distribution (voting item) It is proposed to the General Meeting to resolve upon a total dividend distribution from the profits over the financial year 2023 of EUR 0 60 per ordinary share. As discussed under agenda item [2.c.]  the dividend policy reflects the Company's strong liquidity as well as the confidence that the Management Board has in the long- term ability of the Company to generate a solid cash flow. With this in mind  the Management Board  with the approval of the Supervisory Board  proposes to declare a dividend of EUR 0 60 per ordinary share from the profits over the financial year 2023. On 9 August 2023  the interim distribution of EUR 0 40 per ordinary share was effected; this will be deducted from the total dividend distribution making the final dividend EUR 0 20 per ordinary share. The final dividend of EUR 0 20 per ordinary share will be made payable on or around May 15  2024 to shareholders of record on May 13  2024. The ex-dividend date will be May 10  2024.

Re-appointment of KPMG Accountants N.V. as external auditor of the Company for the years 2024 and 2025 (voting item) The Supervisory Board proposes to re-appoint KPMG Accountants N.V. (""KPMG"") as external auditor of the Company for the financial years 2024 and 2025. KPMG was first appointed as external auditor in 2016 for the financial years 2016 and 2017. The Supervisory Board  upon the recommendations of the Audit & Risk Management Committee and the Management Board  has extensively reviewed KPMG's performance and as result has resolved to propose to re-appoint KPMG as external auditor of the Company. The Audit & Risk Management Committee has confirmed in its recommendation that KPMG's skills  expertise and level of communication with the Management Board and Supervisory Board in executing its external auditing duties  all have received high marks and it has further stated that its recommendation is free from influence by a third party and that no clause of a contract as referred to in article 16(6) of the EU regulation no. 537/2014 restricts the resolution of the General Meeting. Agenda item 9. Adoption of the Remuneration Policy for the Supervisory Board (voting item) It is proposed to adopt the Remuneration Policy for the Supervisory Board. AMG's current Remuneration Policy for the Supervisory Board members was adopted by the General Meeting at the 2020 Annual General Meeting. In accordance with the Dutch Civil Code  the General Meeting is requested to approve the Remuneration Policy for the Supervisory Board every four years. The Remuneration Committee has reviewed the current Remuneration Policy for the Supervisory Board and has recommended to the Supervisory Board that both in structure and content  the current Remuneration Policy for the Supervisory Board still fully supports the overall compensation philosophy of the Company and complies with the statutory and Dutch Corporate Governance Code requirements. The proposed Remuneration Policy (attached to this Agenda as Annex A) is in all material respects identical to the Remuneration Policy that was adopted by the General Meeting in 2020. It is important to note that upon approval of the proposed Remuneration Policy for the Supervisory Board  the remuneration structure and practice for the Supervisory Board that has been in place since 2013  is continued. The Supervisory Board recommends to the General Meeting  to vote in favor of adopting this Remuneration Policy of the Supervisory Board as a solid framework in order to be able to continue to attract high quality new candidates and to adequately reward its current members. In accordance with article 2:145 subs thatection 2 and article 2:135a subsection 2 of the Dutch Civil Code  the proposal can only be adopted with a majority of at least three-fourths (75%) of the votes cast. The proposed Remuneration Policy for the Supervisory Board is available for inspection at the offices of the Company and is published at the Company's website (www.amg-nv.com). Agenda item 10. Renewal of the authorization to (i) issue shares and/or grant rights to acquire shares and (ii) to restrict or exclude the pre-emptive rights for general corporate purposes and/or for the purpose of mergers and acquisitions  and/or for strategic alliances and/or for financial support arrangements (voting items) It is proposed to authorize the Management Board for a period of 18 months as of May 8  2024  i.e.   up to and including November 7  2025  to  subject to the approval of the SupervisoryBoard  issue shares in the Company's share capital and/or grant rights to subscribe for shares in the Company's share capital up to a maximum of 10% of the Company's issued share capital as at December 31  2023. AMG.27.03.2024 7It is proposed to authorize the Management Board for a period of 18 months as of May 8  2024  i.e.   up to and including November 7  2025  to  subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board  restrict or exclude the preemptive rights accruing to shareholders upon an issuance as referred to under agenda item 10.a. On May 4  2023  the General Meeting designated the Management Board as the corporate body which  subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board  is authorized to issue shares and grant rights to subscribe for shares  with the right to restrict or exclude pre-emptive rights. The authorization referred to in the previous sentence was restricted to 10% of the Company's issued share capital as at December 31  2022 and will expire on November 4  2024. Under this agenda item  it is proposed to renew this authorization for a period of 18 months  however for a maximum of 10% of the issued share capital as at December 31  2023  with effect from May 8  2024  including the right for the Management Board to restrict and/or exclude pre-emptive rights. The Management Board emphasizes that the authorization to issue shares and/or grant rights to subscribe for shares  combined with the authorization to restrict and/or exclude the pre-emptive rights  provides the Management Board with the flexibility necessary to manage net equity and/or to respond to any demand for shares in the Company's share capital in the context of general corporate purposes that may arise at any time. In addition  this authorization provides the Management Board with the flexibility in financing mergers  acquisitions  strategic alliances and/or financial support arrangements and the necessary tools to respond decisively to emerging business opportunities and is as such of high importance to the ability to further implement the strategy of AMG. Agenda item 11. Renewal of the authorization to acquire shares in the Company's own share capital (voting item) On May 4  2023  with effect as of that date  the Management Board was authorized by the General Meeting to acquire shares in the Company's own share capital for a period of 18 months. The General Meeting is requested to renew this authorization for a period of 18 months. The purpose of the proposal is to create flexibility to return capital to the shareholders. Furthermore  the authorization can be used to acquire ordinary shares to cover the Company's obligations related to share- based remuneration. Repurchased ordinary shares may also be used to cover other obligations of the Company to deliver ordinary shares. It is proposed to authorize the Management Board for a period of 18 months as of May 8  2024  i.e.  up to and including November 7  2025  to acquire  subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board  shares in the Company's share capital up to 10% of the Company's issued share capital at the date of acquisition  at the stock exchange or otherwise  at a price between par value and 110 percent of the market price of the ordinary shares. The market price is defined as the average closing price of the Company's ordinary shares at Euronext Amsterdam N.V. on the five consecutive trading days immediately preceding the day of purchase by or for the account of the Company. In case of a self-tender offer  an accelerated repurchase program or any other repurchase program deemed similar by the Management Board  the Management Board may decide that the market price is defined as the arithmetic average of the daily VWAP (volume-weighted average price) of ordinary shares on Euronext Amsterdam over a period of at least one trading day.

(NYSE and TASE: TEVA)  and Medincell (Euronext: MEDCL)  today announced results from the efficacy portion of the Phase 3 Subcutaneous OLAnzapine extended-Release Injection Study (SOLARIS) trial evaluating TEV-‘749 in adult patients with schizophrenia compared to placebo. Results demonstrated that TEV-‘749 met its primary endpoint as measured by a change in the PANSS total score from baseline after 8 weeks compared to placebo. TEV-‘749 utilizes SteadyTeq™  a copolymer technology proprietary to Medincell that provides a controlled steady release of olanzapine  the most prescribed 2nd generation antipsychotic for schizophrenia in the U.S.1This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240508366301/en/TEV-‘749 met its primary endpoint across all three dosing groups  with mean difference in change in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score from baseline to week 8 of -9.71 points  -11.27 points  and -9.71 points versus placebo for the high  medium  and low dose groups  respectively. These differences from placebo were clinically meaningful and statistically significant with adjusted P-values of <0.001 for each comparison. Key secondary endpoints of CGI-S (Clinical Global Impressions – schizophrenia) and PSP (Personal and Social Performance Scale) total score were also statistically significant after adjusting for multiplicity. No cases of PDSS have been reported to date  after administration of approximately 80% of the target injection number.An estimated 3.5 million people are currently diagnosed with schizophrenia in the U.S. It is a chronic  progressive  and severely debilitating mental disorder that affects how one thinks  feels and behaves. Currently  there is no long-acting olanzapine treatment option available for schizophrenia that does not risk post-injection delirium/sedation syndrome (PDSS). PDSS is characterized by the sudden and unexpected onset of delirium or sedation within the first several hours of receiving treatment and has been associated with the intramuscular injection of long-acting olanzapine.“These encouraging results from the efficacy portion of our Phase 3 SOLARIS trial demonstrate the potential of TEV-‘749 to be an effective long-acting treatment option for schizophrenia and further show our dedication to advancing innovative science in mental health and beyond ” said Eric Hughes  MD  PhD  Executive Vice President of Global R&D and Chief Medical Officer at Teva. “Schizophrenia can be a devastating disease for both the people struggling with it as well their families. Schizophrenia is often a chronic life-long disease  but by using medication consistently  people can find the treatment help they deserve. This also has the potential to reduce the burden for not only themselves  but their caregivers and loved ones as well.”The PANSS is composed of 3 subscales: Positive Scale  Negative Scale  and General Psychopathology Scale. Each subscale is rated with 1 to 7 points ranging from absent to extreme. Each of the 30 items is accompanied by a specific definition as well as detailed anchoring criteria for all seven rating points. These seven points represent increasing levels of psychopathology  as follows: 1- absent 2- minimal 3- mild 4- moderate 5- moderate severe 6- severe 7- extreme; the PANSS overall total score ranges from 30 to 210  with a higher score indicating greater symptom severity. The primary efficacy endpoint was measured by change from baseline to week 8 against the PANSS total score.“These data reinforce the potential of TEV-‘749 as a subcutaneous long-acting injectable by using a proven molecule with an established long-acting delivery system ” said Christoph Correll  MD  Professor of Psychiatry at the Zucker School of Medicine  Hempstead  NY and SOLARIS study co-ordinating investigator. “Most patients with schizophrenia will experience one or more relapses throughout their treatment journeys  so I very much welcome the development of new and innovative long-acting treatment options that may better fit into their lives.”“The positive news from the phase III SOLARIS trial continues to encourage ongoing innovation in treatment options for those living with schizophrenia. We are thrilled to be part of this journey with Teva through a strong partnership that allows us to leverage our pioneering long-acting technology for the benefit of patients ” said Christophe Douat  CEO of Medincell.Additional efficacy and safety findings from the Phase 3 SOLARIS study are planned for presentation at a medical meeting later this year.The long-term safety of TEV-‘749 and incidence of PDSS are also being evaluated in the SOLARIS open-label study (period 2) with safety data topline readout expected in the second half of 2024.TEV-‘749 is an investigational once-monthly subcutaneous long-acting injection of the 2nd generation antipsychotic olanzapine and is not approved by any regulatory authority for any use and its safety and efficacy are not established.About Subcutaneous OLAnzapine Extended-Release Injection Study (SOLARIS)SOLARIS is a multinational  multicenter  randomized  double-blind  parallel-group  placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy  safety  and tolerability of olanzapine extended-release injectable suspension for subcutaneous use as a treatment in patients (ages 18-65 years) with schizophrenia. For period one of the study (first 8 weeks)  675 patients were randomized to receive a subcutaneous injection of once-monthly TEV-‘749 (low  medium or high dose) or placebo in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. For period two  which will last for up to 48 weeks  patients who completed period one were randomized and equally allocated to one of the three TEV-‘749 treatment groups. The end-of-treatment and follow-up visits will be at 4 and 8 weeks after administration of the last treatment dose  respectively. The primary objective of the Phase 3 SOLARIS study was to evaluate the efficacy of TEV-‘749 in adult patients with schizophrenia. A key secondary objective was to further evaluate the efficacy of TEV-‘749 based on additional parameters in adult patients with schizophrenia. A secondary objective that is still ongoing through period two of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of TEV-‘749 in adult patients with schizophrenia.About SchizophreniaSchizophrenia is a chronic  progressive and severely debilitating mental disorder that affects how one thinks  feels and acts.2 Patients experience an array of symptoms  which may include delusions  hallucinations  disorganized speech or behavior and impaired cognitive ability.2 3 4 Approximately 1% of the world’s population will develop schizophrenia in their lifetime  and 3.5 million people in the U.S. are currently diagnosed with the condition.3 4 Although schizophrenia can occur at any age  the average age of onset tends to be in the late teens to the early 20s for men  and the late 20s to early 30s for women.4 The long-term course of schizophrenia is marked by episodes of partial or full remission broken by relapses that often occur in the context of psychiatric emergency and require hospitalization.4 Approximately 80% of patients experience multiple relapses over the first five years of treatment  and each relapse carries a biological risk of loss of function  treatment refractoriness  and changes in brain morphology.5 6 7 Patients are often unaware of their illness and its consequences  contributing to treatment nonadherence  high discontinuation rates  and ultimately  significant direct and indirect healthcare costs from subsequent relapses and hospitalizations.2 3 4 5 6 7About TevaTeva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.

For period one of the study (first 8 weeks)  675 patients were randomized to receive a subcutaneous injection of once-monthly TEV-‘749 (low  medium or high dose) or placebo in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. For period two  which will last for up to 48 weeks  patients who completed period one were randomized and equally allocated to one of the three TEV-‘749 treatment groups. The end-of-treatment and follow-up visits will be at 4 and 8 weeks after administration of the last treatment dose  respectively. The primary objective of the Phase 3 SOLARIS study was to evaluate the efficacy of TEV-‘749 in adult patients with schizophrenia. A key secondary objective was to further evaluate the efficacy of TEV-‘749 based on additional parameters in adult patients with schizophrenia. A secondary objective that is still ongoing through period two of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of TEV-‘749 in adult patients with schizophrenia.About SchizophreniaSchizophrenia is a chronic  progressive and severely debilitating mental disorder that affects how one thinks  feels and acts.2 Patients experience an array of symptoms  which may include delusions  hallucinations  disorganized speech or behavior and impaired cognitive ability.2 3 4 Approximately 1% of the world’s population will develop schizophrenia in their lifetime  and 3.5 million people in the U.S. are currently diagnosed with the condition.3 4 Although schizophrenia can occur at any age  the average age of onset tends to be in the late teens to the early 20s for men  and the late 20s to early 30s for women.4 The long-term course of schizophrenia is marked by episodes of partial or full remission broken by relapses that often occur in the context of psychiatric emergency and require hospitalization.4 Approximately 80% of patients experience multiple relapses over the first five years of treatment  and each relapse carries a biological risk of loss of function  treatment refractoriness  and changes in brain morphology.5 6 7 Patients are often unaware of their illness and its consequences  contributing to treatment nonadherence  high discontinuation rates  and ultimately  significant direct and indirect healthcare costs from subsequent relapses and hospitalizations.3 4 5 6 7About TevaTeva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.

(""Aegon"")  to be submitted for adoption by the shareholders of Aegon (the ""Shareholders"") at the Annual General Meeting on June 12  2024. This Policy replaces the Aegon Executive and Non-Executive Remuneration Policies which were adopted by the Shareholders at the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on May 15  2020. This new policy was prepared by the Compensation and Human Resources Committee of Aegon's Board (the ""CHR Committee"") and is put forward by Aegon's Board (the ""Board""). Aegon's Chief Executive Officer did not take part of the decision-making process. At the date of the Annual General Meeting in 2024  the Policy complies with Bermudian law and Aegon's bye-laws. 1.2 Policy Term This Policy will take effect retroactively from January 1  2024  and will remain in effect until the Shareholders have adopted a new Policy. In accordance with Aegon's bye-laws  the Board will submit a Policy for adoption by the Shareholders at the Annual General Meeting at least every four years. The current Policy will remain in effect and unchanged if Shareholders reject a new Policy that is proposed by the Board at a General Meeting  even if this would be four years after the approval of the current Policy. Subsequently  the Board is required to submit a Policy for adoption by the Shareholders at the latest at the next Annual General Meeting (and if rejected again  at the latest at the next Annual General Meeting thereafter  etc.)  while the current Policy remains in effect and unchanged. Each year at the Annual General Meeting  Shareholders will be asked to cast an advisory vote on the remuneration report in which the application of the Policy is disclosed (say-on-pay). 1.3 Key principles The key principles that underly this Policy are to: enable Aegon to attract and retain Executive and Non-Executive Directors who can deliver on Aegon's ambitions for value creation and our strategy for growth;Non-Executive Directors who can deliver on Aegon's ambitions for value creation and our strategy for growth; establish a strong correlation between the Executive Director's remuneration and Aegon's financial performance  as well as the long-term interests of both Aegon and its shareholders;long-term interests of both Aegon and its shareholders; reflect the company's revised profile  geographical footprint  governance  and strategy;consider continental European  UK  and US remuneration market standards and key proxy advisors' guidelines; andachieve an equilibrium among diverse perspectives from various international stakeholders  even though Aegon's US business represents more than half of Aegon's current business mix. 2 Directors' remuneration policy1.4 Policy Review and Revision While the intent is to make no changes during the four-year Policy term  the CHR Committee will annually review the Policy. In this review the CHR Committee will for instance consider the outcomes of the Annual General Meeting's annual advisory (say-on-pay) vote on the remuneration report  in which the application of this Policy is disclosed. In case the CHR Committee concludes that a revision of the Policy is needed  the Board will decide on whether a revised or new Policy will be proposed for adoption by the Shareholders at the next Annual General Meeting. 1.5 Temporary Derogation from the Policy Derogation from this Policy is only allowed under exceptional circumstances and for a limited time period under the following conditions: The derogation can be from any remuneration component included in this Policy  as long as it continues to stay:in line with the general spirit of this Policy; in line with the market practice in the labor market peer group as defined in this Policy  and; compliant with the applicable legislation and regulations.When the Board adopts a proposed derogation  it includes at least the following details:an explanation why the derogation is required and how it serves the long-term interest of Aegon  which remuneration component(s) it concerns and how it affects the compensation levels  and; for how long the derogation will be in place.The details of the derogation and explanation will be disclosed in the next Remuneration Report. 2 Appointment The Shareholders appoint and reappoint Executive and Non-Executive Directors in accordance with Aegon's bye-laws. The Executive Director and Aegon enter into an employment agreement for an indetermined period of time (the ""Employment Agreement""). 3 Labor market peer group The labor market peer group allows the Board to benchmark remuneration structures and levels for the Executive and Non-Executive Directors. The peer group consists of a blend of eight European insurance companies  four Dutch general industry companies  and four US insurance companies. This blended group reflects the markets in which Aegon currently competes for Executive and Non-Executive talent  given the company's profile and geographical spread of its business. The Board deliberately underweighted the proportion of US insurance companies  while currently more than half of Aegon's business is in the US  to recognize that Aegon's roots  headquarters and primary listing are in Europe. 3 Directors' remuneration policyRevenue and total assets are used as size criteria to select peer companies  because in the Insurance industry these are the most correlative metrics to compensation levels. The European and US insurance companies are selected based on the following selection criteria: Quantitative selection based on revenue and total assets within a size bandwidth of 0.4 to 2.5  and a focus on Life & Health Insurance as main Global Industry Classification Standard sub-industry.sub-industry. Qualitative refinement to ensure comparability with Aegon's international business model and geographical dispersion. The Dutch general industry companies are selected based on the following selection criterion: Quantitative selection of companies in the Euronext AEX index with significant revenues from North America. European insurance companies Dutch general industry US insurance companies companies Assicurazioni Generali Prudential Ahold Delhaize Lincoln National Aviva Swiss Life Holding Randstad Principal Financial Group AXA Unipol Gruppo Philips Prudential Financial Legal & General Group Zurich Insurance Group Wolters Kluwer Voya Financial The Board will annually review the labor market peer group to ensure it remains relevant and up to date  for example in case of de-listings  mergers  or other extraordinary circumstances. 4 Executive Director Remuneration Policy 4.1 Remuneration package The details of the Executive Director's remuneration package are confirmed in an Employment Agreement. The Employment Agreement may only reflect and include remuneration components that are included in this Policy. To attract and retain the best talent  the aim is to be competitive with respect to the market median of the labor market peer group for the Executive Director's target total remuneration level. This is combined with pay-mix that is more heavily weighted towards variable  performance-based remuneration. This would result in remuneration outcomes that appropriately vary above/below market median in line with Aegon's business performance. Each year  the CHR Committee will review the base salary  the target Short-Term Incentive (in a percentage of base salary)  the target Long-Term Incentive (in a percentage of base salary)  and the target total remuneration level of the Executive Director. The CHR Committee may recommend changes to the base salary  target Short-Term Incentive  and/or target Long-Term Incentive levels  after considering the Executive Director's performance  Aegon's performance  and future movements in the benchmark data of the labor market peer group  within the limits of the Policy (i.e. to compete with respect 4 Directors' remuneration policyto the market median of the labor market peer group). The Board may adopt  reject  or adjust the proposed recommendations by the CHR Committee. Any change to these remuneration levels will be disclosed in the Remuneration Report. 4.2 Base salary The purpose of base salary is to provide guaranteed remuneration proportional to the Executive Director's experience  skills (and external market for such skills)  and/or performance. The gross base salary is paid each month in cash. 4.3 Pension Pension is guaranteed remuneration which aims at the future financial security after retirement. The Executive Director is enrolled in the applicable local employee pension plan(s) and/or receives cash in lieu of pension. The annual total pension contributions equal 15% of the annual gross base salary level. 4.4 Short-Term Incentive 4.4.1 Purpose and operation The Short-Term Incentive (""STI"") is to provide a distinct variable  performance-based remuneration component in cash that aligns the remuneration of the Executive Director with short-term financial and ESG objectives of Aegon. The STI award is calculated by multiplying the Executive Director's individual target STI amount with the STI result after a 1-year performance period. The Executive Director's individual target STI amount is determined by the Board and equal to a percentage of base salary (see 4.2).The STI result can range between 0% and 200% of target  depending on the weighted average outcome of the STI performance metrics that have been selected for the plan year. 4.4.2 Performance metrics  weights  and target levels For the STI  the Board will select two to four performance metrics that are predominantly financial in nature (at least 80% of the weight) and include quantitative ESG metrics. The Board aims to keep the STI performance metrics stable for consecutive plan years  but may exercise discretion to develop the metrics over time to ensure continued alignment with the company's strategy and stakeholder's interests. For each plan year  the Board determines the weight  threshold  target  and maximum performance levels for each of these performance metrics  after taking into account the target setting risk assessment by the Chief Risk Officer. The targets for financial performance metrics will be based on the Board-approved budget. Each metric will result in an outcome on the performance scale which ranges from 0% to 200% of target. A metric result below the threshold level will have a 0% outcome  between threshold and target the outcome is between 50% and 100% of target on a linear basis  between target and maximum the outcome 5 Directors' remuneration policyis between 100% and 200% of target on a linear basis  and for maximum or higher results the outcome is capped at 200% of target. For each plan year  the STI performance metrics  definitions  and weights will be disclosed prospectively. The STI target levels and performance results will be retrospectively disclosed in the remuneration report after completion of the performance period  including the underlying details of the blended metrics. 4.4.3 Discretion Once approved by the Board  the STI performance metrics and targets will remain unchanged during the performance period  except to reflect events such as corporate transactions or other major events where the Board considers it necessary in its judgement to make adjustments to ensure the performance metric's outcomes appropriately reflect Aegon's performance during the 1-year performance period. 4.5 Long-Term Incentive 4.5.1 Purpose and operation The Long-Term Incentive (""LTI"") is to provide a distinct variable  performance-based remuneration component in Aegon performance shares that aligns the remuneration of the Executive Director with the long-term financial and strategic business objectives of Aegon and its shareholders. The LTI award is calculated by multiplying the Executive Director's individual target number of LTI performance shares by the LTI result after a 3-year performance period. The Executive Director's individual target LTI amount is determined by the Board and equal to a percentage of base salary (see 4.2).The target number of LTI performance shares is subsequently calculated by dividing the target LTI amount by the LTI grant price.This LTI grant price is equal to weighted average Aegon share price between December 15 prior to the start of the performance period and January 15 in the first year of the performance period.The LTI result can range between 0% and 200% of target  depending on the weighted average outcome of the LTI performance metrics that have been selected for the plan year. Dividend entitlements for the Aegon performance shares will be accrued until the end of the performance period and will vest as additional Aegon shares against the close price on the day before vesting. After vesting  the LTI performance shares and additional Aegon shares for the dividend entitlements are subject to a 2-year holding period. This holding period continues to apply post-employment. If the Executive Director is a good leaver based on the plan rules or at the Board's discretion  the outstanding LTI awards will be based on the actual LTI result after the 3-year performance period and will be pro-rated for the time from the start of the performance period to the termination date. The Board may deviate from pro-rating the LTI awards in exceptional circumstances and will disclose this in the remuneration report. If the Executive Director is not a good leaver  all outstanding LTI awards will lapse. 6 Directors' remuneration policy4.5.2 Metrics For the LTI  the Board will select two to four performance metrics that are predominantly or fully financial in nature (with at least 80% weight). The Board aims to keep the LTI performance metrics stable for consecutive plan years  but may exercise discretion to develop the metrics over time to ensure continued alignment with the company's strategy and stakeholder's interests. For each plan year  the Board determines the weight  threshold  target  and maximum performance levels for each of these performance metrics  after taking into account the target setting risk assessment by the Chief Risk Officer. The targets for financial performance metrics will be based on the Board-approved budget and mid-term plan. Each metric will result in an outcome on the performance scale which ranges from 0% to 200% of target. A metric result below the threshold level will have a 0% outcome  between threshold and target the outcome is between 50% and 100% of target on a linear basis  between target and maximum the outcome is between 100% and 200% of target on a linear basis  and for maximum or higher results the outcome is capped at 200% of target. For each plan year  the LTI performance metrics  definitions  and weights will be disclosed prospectively. The LTI target levels and performance results will be retrospectively disclosed in the remuneration report after completion of the performance period. 4.5.3 Discretion Once approved by the Board  the LTI performance metrics and targets will remain unchanged during the performance period  except to reflect events such as corporate transactions or other major events where the Board considers it necessary in its judgement to make adjustments to ensure the performance metric's outcomes appropriately reflect Aegon's performance during the 3-year performance period. 4.6 Other benefits The Board may  offer the Executive Director other benefits which include  but are not limited to: A Company Car in accordance with the local company car policy for employees.A driver for the company car for business related purposes.Reimbursement of the Executive Director's (tax) costs for the private use of the company car (with private use subject to approval by the Chair of the Board).Third party tax services to ensure compliance with the applicable tax law(s).To participate in other collective benefits which are offered to (local) Aegon employees  such as but not limited to the collective disability arrangement  collective health insurance  the Expat Policy  the collective (local) Aegon employee provisions regarding reimbursement of expenses  sickness  absence and disability. The Board will not approve any personal loans  guarantees or the like to the Executive Director  unless in the normal course of business and on terms that collectively apply to (local) Aegon employees. 7 Directors' remuneration policy4.7 Minimum shareholding requirement The purpose of the minimum shareholding requirement is to further align the long-term interests of the Executive Director with the long-term interests of Aegon and its shareholders. The Executive Director is required to hold 400% of the base salary level in Aegon shares  within four years after this Policy is adopted or from appointment as Executive Director  whichever comes last. The holding is to be built up by retaining after-tax Aegon shares vested from the LTI and does not require personal share purchases. Before the minimum holding requirement level is reached  the Executive Director is not allowed to sell vested Aegon shares  except to cover tax for the vesting of these shares. This minimal holding requirement applies until the individual no longer holds the position of Executive Director. 4.8 Malus and claw back The Board can adjust STI and/or LTI awards downward before allocation or pay-out (i.e. apply a malus adjustment) and has the authority to claw back any paid STI and/or vested LTI awards. The Board takes advice from the Chief Risk Officer  who performs an annual malus and claw back risk assessment  reviewing adherence to the enterprise risk management framework  the severity of risk failures  and compliance breaches as well as conduct that has negatively impacted the financial position or risk profile of the company. Full or partial malus or claw back will be applied in the following exceptional situations: the Executive Director has failed to meet the appropriate standards of competence and correct behavior;the Executive Director was responsible for conduct that has resulted in a significant decline in the company's financial position;the payment was based on incorrect information on the fulfillment of the criteria and/or conditions for the payments(s); and/orthe payment(s) of such compensation would be unacceptable according to the principles of reasonableness and fairness. In accordance with the US Securities and Exchange Commission rules that apply in 2024  if Aegon is required to prepare a Restatement  the Board shall recover the portion of any incentive-based compensation that is erroneously awarded compensation  unless the CHR Committee determines that recovery would be impracticable. Recovery of incentive-based compensation under the current US Securities and Exchange Commission rules is required regardless of whether the applicable person engaged in misconduct or otherwise caused or contributed to the requirement for the restatement and regardless of whether or when restated financial statements are filed by Aegon. 8 Directors' remuneration policy4.9 Termination and notice period The Board will set the notice period that will apply to the Executive Director and to the Board for terminating the Employment Agreement with the Executive Director  which can be up to twelve months. During the notice period the Executive Director continues to be eligible for all remuneration components included in this Policy. The Board may agree to a Termination Fee up to one time the annual base salary in the Employment Agreement for certain scenarios  except when the Employment Agreement is terminated by the Board with immediate effect as described below. The Board may terminate the Employment Agreement with immediate effect and without notice being required  with no obligation for Aegon to any Termination Fee or pay damages  for reasons which are related to: acts or omissions on the side of the Executive Director which constitute an urgent cause  imputable acts or negligence  seriously culpable actions  or neglect of the Executive Director in fulfilling the duties; oracts or omissions on the side of the Executive Director which constitutes gross negligent behavior of the Executive Director  including but not limited to a situation where any authority supervising the activities of Aegon takes the view that the Executive Director cannot continue in this position any longer. 4.10 Corporate transactions In case of a change of control of Aegon  where one party has the ability to vote with the majority of the outstanding shares of Aegon  all Aegon performance shares that are unvested at the date of the change of control would vest immediately at target and on a pro rata basis to reflect the performance period until the date of the change of control. The vested Aegon performance shares would be released from the performance conditions  settled in cash  and the holding period would discontinue to apply with immediate effect. 4.11 Buy-out arrangement The Board may agree to a buy-out arrangement in order to attract an external candidate to be appointed as Executive Director. The arrangement can only be offered on an exceptional basis  when this is in the long-term interest of Aegon and there are circumstances that justify such an arrangement. Examples of these circumstances are  but not limited to  competition in recruiting the same candidate (i.e. increased market value)  competition from the candidate's employer  differences in compensation and benefits compared to the candidate's previous employer  loss of income by the candidate as a result of a non-compete period  the candidate losing unvested variable compensation at their previous employer  and losing the variable compensation opportunity of the current performance year at the previous employer. When the arrangement replaces forfeited compensation (opportunity)  it should be on substantially similar terms (e.g. deferral periods) and at the moment of conversion not more generous compared to the value that was lost. Any buy-out arrangement will be disclosed in the Remuneration Report. 9 Directors' remuneration policy",neutral,0.03,0.97,0.01,mixed,0.18,0.44,0.38,True,English,"[""Directors' Remuneration Policy"", 'Aegon', 'Board', 'four Dutch general industry companies', 'four US insurance companies', 'eight European insurance companies', ""key proxy advisors' guidelines"", 'labor market peer group', 'next Annual General Meeting', 'US remuneration market standards', 'various international stakeholders', 'next Remuneration Report', 'Human Resources Committee', 'current business mix', 'Chief Executive Officer', 'limited time period', 'Non-Executive Remuneration Policies', 'four-year Policy term', 'The Executive Director', ""Directors' remuneration policy"", 'US business', 'market practice', 'general spirit', 'annual advisory', 'blended group', 'continental European', '1.3 Key principles', 'indetermined period', 'Non-Executive Directors', 'remuneration component', 'remuneration structures', 'CHR Committee', '1.2 Policy Term', 'decision-making process', 'Bermudian law', 'advisory vote', 'value creation', 'strong correlation', 'financial performance', 'long-term interests', 'geographical footprint', 'diverse perspectives', 'exceptional circumstances', 'applicable legislation', 'employment agreement', 'current Policy', 'new policy', 'The Shareholders', 'following conditions', 'following details', '1.5 Temporary Derogation', '1.4 Policy Review', 'Aegon Ltd', 'compensation levels', 'Policy Derogation', 'Aegon Executive', '1 Policy', 'terms', 'adoption', 'June', 'May', 'Board', 'part', 'date', 'bye-laws', 'effect', 'January', 'accordance', 'approval', 'application', 'pay', 'ambitions', 'strategy', 'growth', 'company', 'revised', 'profile', 'governance', 'UK', 'equilibrium', 'half', 'Revision', 'intent', 'changes', 'instance', 'outcomes', 'case', 'regulations', 'explanation', 'place', '2 Appointment', 'markets', '1.1']",2024-05-08,2024-05-09,marketscreener.com

Normalized EBITDA and normalized EBIT do not have a standard calculation method and AB InBev’s definition of normalized EBITDA and normalized EBIT may not be comparable to that of other companies.NotesTo facilitate the understanding of AB InBev’s underlying performance  the analyses of growth  including all comments in this press release  unless otherwise indicated  are based on organic growth and normalized numbers. In other words  financials are analyzed eliminating the impact of changes in currencies on translation of foreign operations  and scope changes. For FY24  the definition of organic revenue growth has been amended to cap the price growth in Argentina to a maximum of 2% per month (26.8% year-over-year). Corresponding adjustments are made to all income statement related items in the organic growth calculations through scope changes. Scope changes also represent the impact of acquisitions and divestitures  the start or termination of activities or the transfer of activities between segments  curtailment gains and losses and year over year changes in accounting estimates and other assumptions that management does not consider as part of the underlying performance of the business. The organic growth of our global brands  Budweiser  Stella Artois  Corona and Michelob Ultra  excludes exports to Australia for which a perpetual license was granted to a third party upon disposal of the Australia operations in 2020. All references per hectoliter (per hl) exclude US non-beer activities. Whenever presented in this document  all performance measures (EBITDA  EBIT  profit  tax rate  EPS) are presented on a “normalized” basis  which means they are presented before non-underlying items. Non-underlying items are either income or expenses which do not occur regularly as part of the normal activities of the Company. They are presented separately because they are important for the understanding of the underlying sustainable performance of the Company due to their size or nature. Normalized measures are additional measures used by management and should not replace the measures determined in accordance with IFRS as an indicator of the Company’s performance. We are reporting the results from Argentina applying hyperinflation accounting since 3Q18. The IFRS rules (IAS 29) require us to restate the year-to-date results for the change in the general purchasing power of the local currency  using official indices before converting the local amounts at the closing rate of the period. In 1Q24  we reported a negative impact on the profit attributable to equity holders of AB InBev of 55 million USD. The impact in 1Q24 Basic EPS was -0.03 USD. Values in the figures and annexes may not add up  due to rounding. 1Q24 EPS is based upon a weighted average of 2 007 million shares compared to a weighted average of 2 015 million shares for 1Q23.Legal disclaimerThis release contains “forward-looking statements”.

Normalized EBITDA and normalized EBIT do not have a standard calculation method and AB InBev’s definition of normalized EBITDA and normalized EBIT may not be comparable to that of other companies.NotesTo facilitate the understanding of AB InBev’s underlying performance  the analyses of growth  including all comments in this press release  unless otherwise indicated  are based on organic growth and normalized numbers. In other words  financials are analyzed eliminating the impact of changes in currencies on translation of foreign operations  and scope changes. For FY24  the definition of organic revenue growth has been amended to cap the price growth in Argentina to a maximum of 2% per month (26.8% year-over-year). Corresponding adjustments are made to all income statement related items in the organic growth calculations through scope changes. Scope changes also represent the impact of acquisitions and divestitures  the start or termination of activities or the transfer of activities between segments  curtailment gains and losses and year over year changes in accounting estimates and other assumptions that management does not consider as part of the underlying performance of the business. The organic growth of our global brands  Budweiser  Stella Artois  Corona and Michelob Ultra  excludes exports to Australia for which a perpetual license was granted to a third party upon disposal of the Australia operations in 2020. All references per hectoliter (per hl) exclude US non-beer activities. Whenever presented in this document  all performance measures (EBITDA  EBIT  profit  tax rate  EPS) are presented on a “normalized” basis  which means they are presented before non-underlying items. Non-underlying items are either income or expenses which do not occur regularly as part of the normal activities of the Company. They are presented separately because they are important for the understanding of the underlying sustainable performance of the Company due to their size or nature. Normalized measures are additional measures used by management and should not replace the measures determined in accordance with IFRS as an indicator of the Company’s performance. We are reporting the results from Argentina applying hyperinflation accounting since 3Q18. The IFRS rules (IAS 29) require us to restate the year-to-date results for the change in the general purchasing power of the local currency  using official indices before converting the local amounts at the closing rate of the period. In 1Q24  we reported a negative impact on the profit attributable to equity holders of AB InBev of 55 million USD. The impact in 1Q24 Basic EPS was -0.03 USD. Values in the figures and annexes may not add up  due to rounding. 1Q24 EPS is based upon a weighted average of 2 007 million shares compared to a weighted average of 2 015 million shares for 1Q23.Legal disclaimerThis release contains “forward-looking statements”.

Normalized EBITDA and normalized EBIT do not have a standard calculation method and AB InBev's definition of normalized EBITDA and normalized EBIT may not be comparable to that of other companies.NotesTo facilitate the understanding of AB InBev's underlying performance  the analyses of growth  including all comments in this press release  unless otherwise indicated  are based on organic growth and normalized numbers. In other words  financials are analyzed eliminating the impact of changes in currencies on translation of foreign operations  and scope changes. For FY24  the definition of organic revenue growth has been amended to cap the price growth in Argentina to a maximum of 2% per month (26.8% year-over-year). Corresponding adjustments are made to all income statement related items in the organic growth calculations through scope changes.

Whenever presented in this document  all performance measures (EBITDA  EBIT  profit  tax rate  EPS) are presented on a normalized basis  which means they are presented before non-underlying items. Non-underlying items are either income or expenses which do not occur regularly as part of the normal activities of the Company.

Cadogan's assets are concentrated in the West of the country. The oil services business focuses on workover operations  civil works services and other services to satisfy Cadogan intra-group operational needs.Our business modelWe aim to increase value through:Maintaining a robust balance sheet  monetising the remaining value of our Ukrainian assets and supplementing E&P cash flow with revenues from gas trading and oil servicesDeveloping new activities along the energy value chain with a lower impact on environmentDiversifying Cadogan's portfolio  both geographically and operationallyUkraine2023 remained a highly challenging year for Cadogan due to the ongoing invasion of Ukraine by Russia and its consequences on the operational activities of the Group.West UkraineThe Group continued to produce oil from its production Blazhiv license located in the West of Ukraine. The Group could not avoid temporary shutdowns of its production during in the Q1 2023 due to the severe constraints arisen in the country. Notwithstanding this  production grew up by 1% above the production of 2022. Net oil production was 119 057 bbl corresponding to an average of 326 bpd.Cadogan has signed with PJSC Ukrnafta the extension of the wells Blazhiv-3 and Blazhiv-Monastyrets-3 lease contracts for a 5-year period (previous contracts were for a 3-year period) ahead the expiry period which allowed to avoid production stoppage and secure cash flows.In 2023  the Company continued focusing on the subsoil study of Blazhiv field. Cadogan conducted and completed full hydrodynamic surveys of Blazhiv-1  Blazhiv-3  Blazhiv-Monastyrets-3 and Blazhiv-10 wells. The hydrodynamic model as well as the production forecast were updated. In the second half 2023  the Company launched a new assessment of hydrocarbon reserves  by an independent expert  according to PRMS standards. The assessment was completed at the end of February 2024.Cadogan is expanding into the electricity generation business by using the gas emissions related to oil production. This will allow to significantly reduce atmospheric emissions and ensure additional cash-flow. The Company launched the project to capture non-commercial associated gas during oil production at the Blazhiv field  which will then be used to generate electricity for sale on the grid. This project is anticipated to result in a substantial decrease in Cadogan's annual gas emissions  with the intensity ratio estimated to drop from 126 to approximately 33 tons of CO2 e/Kboe. The project is scheduled to be operational in Q1 2025.The Company completed the acquisition of the 5% of the share interest in Usenco Nadra LLC and now holds 100% of Usenco Nadra LLC.Subsidiary businessesDue to high market volatility caused by military escalation in Ukraine  Cadogan has kept its trading activity low. Despite this  the Company managed to execute few deals  and kept in storage 0.7 million m3 of gas to secure resources.Astroservice LLC  the oil services subsidiary  continued to support Blazhiv license wells' operations.ItalyThe Group owns a 90% interest in Exploenergy s.r.l.  an Italian company  which controls two exploration areas (Reno Centese and Corzano)  located in the Po Valley region (Northern Italy).In February 2022  the Plan for the Sustainable Energy Transition of Suitable Areas (""PITESAI"") was approved by the Ministry for Environment and Energy Transition. It delivers a new framework for the possible resumption of exploration and production activities on land and at sea. Exploenergy was notified in 2022 that its projects were located in compatible areas identified by the PITESAI. In November 2023  Exploenergy was notified by the Ministry for Environment and Energy Transition  that the procedure for verification of the technical  organizational and economic capacity of Exploenergy as a qualified gas operator resulted in a successful decision. In February 2024  the Regional Administrative Court rejected the PITESAI. Exploenergy is awaiting the decision of the Ministry for Environment and Energy Transition to indicate the way forward. The Italian national interest in the development of gas fields remains confirmed.In February 2019  the Group entered in a 2-year loan agreement with Proger Management & Partners Srl (""PMP"") with an option which Cadogan could exercise  with no obligation  to get a 33% equity interest in Proger Ingegneria Srl which in turn held at 31 December 2020 a 75.95% equity interest in Proger Spa. Proger is an Italian engineering company providing services in Italy and in different international areas.Cadogan did not exercise the Call Option. In February 2021  Cadogan notified PMP that according to the Loan Agreement  the Maturity Date occurred on 25 February 2021  and as the Call Option was not exercised  PMP must fulfill the payment of EUR 14 857 350  being the reimbursement of the Loan in terms of principal and the accumulated interest at this Maturity Date. PMP is in default since 25 February 2021. End of March 2021  PMP requested an arbitration to have the Loan Agreement recognized as an equity investment contract  which is rejected by Cadogan as the terms of the Loan Agreement are clear and include the right to repayment at maturity if the Call Option is not exercised.The Arbitration proceeding ended in July 2022.The Arbitral Committee:- Rejected Proger's principal claim  and declared that the Loan Agreement is valid and effective - Deemed to qualify the Call Option as a preliminary contract under condition  but- Rejected Proger's claim ex art. 2932 Italian Civil Code  stating that it is impossible to give an award producing the same effects of a final contract ex art. 2932 Italian Civil Code - This is because of the duties established by the rules of the London Regulatory Authority and because of the need  possibly by both parties  to comply with the due proceedings before the formalization of the entry of Cadogan into the capital of Proger Ingegneria - Subordinated the stipulation of the final contract to the precedent completion of the proceeding and bureaucratic process as per the British rules  stating that  otherwise - There is the obligation on Proger Ingegneria to return the money received under the Loan Agreement.Cadogan introduced an appeal  still pending with a next hearing on September 2025  on the qualification of the Call Option as a preliminary contract. Meanwhile  having taken note of the content of the Award of July 2022  Cadogan repeatedly invited Proger to implement the provisions of the Award. When the invitation remained unsuccessful  Cadogan with a formal notice contested Proger's refusal  arguing that it was in direct contrast with the clear and unequivocal provision of the Award  which expressly subordinates the possible transfer of shareholdings to the prior fulfilment of the formalities required by English law and procedures related to Cadogan as a listed company on the London Stock Exchange; and also opposing Proger for having behaved and continuing to behave in a manner that has made it definitely impossible to the occurrence of the condition precedent referred to in the above-mentioned Award.According to the provisions of the aforementioned Award  the right to reimbursement of the amount covered by the Loan Agreement has arisen in favour of Cadogan  plus interest accrued  and of which Cadogan then demanded immediate payment.Last November 2023  Cadogan had to initiate a second arbitration to assert its right to restitution and obtain Proger's condemnation of the consequent payment.Strategic ReportThe Strategic Report has been prepared in accordance with Section 414A of the Companies Act 2006 (the ""Act"") and presented hereunder. Its purpose is to inform stakeholders and help them assess how the Directors have performed their legal duty under Section 172 of the Act to promote the success of the Company.Section 172 StatementThe Company's section 172 statement is presented on page 36 and 37 and forms part of this strategic report.Principal activity and status of the CompanyThe Company is registered as a public limited company (registration number 05718406) in England and Wales. Its principal activity is oil and gas exploration  development and production; the Company also conducts gas trading and provides services. In November 2022  the shareholders approved the change of name and the strategy to expand its activities along the energy value chain to new forms of energy with a reduced impact on the environment. In December 2023  the Company stepped in the electricity generation sector by launching the investment in the gas-to-power project on the Blazhiv field in Ukraine.The Company's shares have a standard listing on the Official List of the UK Listing Authority and are traded on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange.Key performance indicatorsThe Group monitors its performance through five key performance indicators (""KPIs""):- to increase oil  gas and condensate production measured on the number of barrels of oil equivalent produced per day (""boepd"");- to decrease administrative expenses;- to increase the Group's basic earnings per share;- to maintain no lost time incidents; and- to grow geographically and operationally diversify the portfolio.The Group's performance in 2023 against these KPI's is set out in the table below  together with the prior year performance data.Unit 2023 2022 2023 vs 2022 Average production (working interest basis) 1 boepd 326 323 +1% Overhead (G&A) $ million (3.6) (3.4) +6% Basic profit/(loss) per share 2 cents 0.5 (0.6) +183% Lost time incidents 3 incidents - - - Geographic diversification new assets - - -Average production is calculated as the average daily production during the year Basic profit/(loss) per ordinary share is calculated by dividing the net profit/(loss) for the year attributable to equity holders of the parent company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares during the year Lost time incidents relate to the number of injuries where an employee/contractor is injured and has time off work (IOGP classification)Chairman's Statement2023 was another year of unprecedented challenges for Ukraine  as the invasion of Ukraine by Russia continued to cause damages in the country and impact the European stability. The continuous escalation of hostilities and the geopolitical uncertainties still presented significant obstacles for our operations and were threats to the assets of the Group in Ukraine.Despite these challenges  Cadogan remained steadfast in its commitment to operational excellence  safety  and sustainability. We continued implementing rigorous risk management to safeguard our operations and ensure the well-being of our workforce. The safety of our people is our highest priority. The Group is taking all possible actions to preserve the safety of its employees and meet their needs.As for existing operations in Ukraine  Cadogan has demonstrated robust performance in oil production maintaining steady output levels exceeding 2022 results. Moreover  the Group has launched an investment in the power generation  showcasing its resilience and commitment to growth and diversification despite stormy weathers adversity in the country.In 2023  despite the volatility in the oil and gas markets  Cadogan has adapted its strategies to manage these uncertainties. By implementing agile measures  the Group has effectively mitigated the impact of market volatilities  ensuring continuity of its oil production and sales which allowed to minimize the temporary shutdowns of its production activities.Looking ahead  we recognise that the geopolitical uncertainties and security risks will continue to be high challenges. However  we remain committed to advance through these challenges with resilience  integrity  and determination. This is possible thanks to the commitment of all with a competent and strong management. The Board remains focused on maximizing value from our assets and on our strategy based on the future diversification of our activities towards sectors providing lower impacts on environment along the energy value chain.Michel MeeùsNon-Independent Non-Executive Chairman07 May 2024Chief Executive's ReviewWith the ongoing war resulting from the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022  the Group was compelled to adapt to a drastically altered operating and economic environment. We swiftly implemented measures to mitigate risks  ensuring the safety of personnel and assets while facing the operational  economic  and financial challenges posed. Following these events  in 2023  Cadogan had to operate in a highly complex environment characterised by air shelling of oil & gas and energy infrastructures  oil & gas prices volatilities  martial law restrictions on the financial transactions as well as other associated risks.The ongoing war and the unpredictable air strikes continue to impact the sector of oil and gas in Ukraine  with uncertainties surrounding production  distribution  and market dynamics. The bombing naturally affected the oil and gas production in the country. Oil refineries as well as energy infrastructure suffer constant air attacks and remain severely damaged.Cadogan employees in Ukraine have been operating in a combined remote and office work mode  prioritising both safety and productivity. We are pleased to report that all our employees remain safe and uninjured since the beginning of the invasion in February 2022.The imposition of legislative restrictions on oil and gas exports due to war time has significantly impacted the operations of the industry. This restriction has created challenges for companies operating in the country  limiting their ability to access international markets.The government pursued the efforts for the modernization of its oil and gas regulatory framework  in particular  by enforcing law #4187 which deregulates the subsoil sector  introduces a free market of licenses and simplifies access to the land.Against this challenging background  Cadogan's operational activities performed as following:a 1% increase in production  from 117 793 bbl in 2022 to 119 057 bbl in 2023;a robust balance sheet  with $14.2 million of net cash;a significant diversification in electricity generation business by developing a new project in Ukraine ;the extension of Blazhiv-3 and Blazhiv-Monastyrets-3 wells' lease contracts for a 5-year period; andanother year without LTIs'.Core operationsCadogan has continued to safely produce from its Blazhiv field in the West of Ukraine. Oil production has increased by 1% compared to the previous year despite the temporary production shutdowns caused by severe constraints in the country. This was largely due to our focus on operational efficiency and effective planning and timely implementation of production support measures.In 2023 Cadogan extended lease contracts with PJSC Ukrnafta for the Blazhiv-3 and Blazhiv-Monastyrets-3 wells  prolonging the agreement from 3 to 5 years ahead of the expiry period. This important move ensured uninterrupted production and allowed securing cash flows. By proactively extending these contracts  the company demonstrates its commitment to stability and long-term sustainability in operations.In 2023  the company maintained its focus on studying the subsoil of the Blazhiv field. Full hydrodynamic surveys of Blazhiv-1  Blazhiv-3  Blazhiv-Monastyrets-3  and Blazhiv-10 wells were conducted and completed  leading to updates of the hydrodynamic model and production indicators. Additionally  in the latter half of 2023  the company initiated a new reserves assessment conducted by an independent expert  in accordance with PRMS standards. This assessment was successfully completed in February 2024  enhancing the Company's understanding of hydrocarbon reserves and informing strategic decision-making.Cadogan is expanding its operations into electricity generation activities. The Company has initiated a project focused on capturing non-commercial associated gas during oil production at the Blazhiv field and converting it into electricity for sale on the grid. Expected to be operational in Q1 2025  this project is anticipated to significantly decrease Cadogan's annual gas emissions  with the intensity ratio projected to drop from 126 to approximately 33 tons of CO2 e/Kboe. This project holds significant importance for Ukraine  particularly due to country's shortage of balancing electricity generating facilities caused by the destruction of infrastructure during the war. Cadogan's initiative to convert non-commercial associated gas into electricity will make its contribution to mitigate the gap in generating capacity.High operational standards of the Group have been confirmed again by zero LTI or TRI  with a total over 1 720 000 manhours since the last incident  and re-validation off ISO 14001 & 45001 certifications by respective authority for the one year.Exploenergy srl was notified  in November 2023  by the Ministry for Environment and Energy Transition  that the procedure for verification of the technical  organisational  and economic capacity of Exploenergy as a qualified gas operator resulted in a successful decision. This is a significant move for Cadogan. It will allow a geographical diversification of its assets and a significant value creation. In February 2024  the Regional Administrative Court rejected the PITESAI. Exploenergy is awaiting the decision of the Ministry for Environment and Energy Transition to indicate the way forward. The Italian national interest in the development of gas fields remains confirmed.Non E&P operationsDue to the high market volatility resulting from military escalation in Ukraine  Cadogan has maintained its trading activity at a low level. The Company has cautiously executed few deals in the market while strategically positioning itself for future trading seasons. In preparation for the upcoming 2024 trading season  Cadogan purchased 0.7 million m3 of gas at the end of 2023  The oil services activities were used primarily to serve the Group's wells' operations.ProgerIn February 2019  Cadogan used part of its cash (Euros 13.385 million) to enter into a 2-year Loan Agreement with Proger Managers & Partners  together with a Call Option Agreement which could be exercised by Cadogan  with no obligation  between September 2019 and February 2021  and subject to shareholders' approval  into a 33 % equity interest in Proger Ingegneria which in turn held  a 75.95% equity interest in Proger as at 31 December 2020  and a 96.48% equity interest in Proger as of 31 December 2021.As at 25 February 2021  being the Maturity Date  the Call Option was not exercised by Cadogan and accordingly to its previous notification Cadogan demanded repayment of the Loan together with the accumulated interest which in total amounted Euro 14 857 350. After five business days  PMP was in default and asked for an additional term that ended on 19 March 2021. The terms of the Loan Agreement provide for an additional default interest of 2%. End of March 2021  PMP contested the default situation and the obligation to reimburse and asked for an Arbitration according to the said Loan Agreement to get the Loan Agreement recognised as an equity investment contract. Cadogan consider PMP's arguments as groundless and consider that they are intended to delay PMP reimbursement obligations. The Arbitration proceeding ended in July 2022.The Arbitral Committee:- Rejected Proger's principal claim  and declared that the Loan Agreement is valid and effective - Deemed to qualify the Call Option as a preliminary contract under condition  but- Rejected Proger's claim ex art. 2932 Italian Civil Code  stating that it is impossible to give an award producing the same effects of a final contract ex art. 2932 Italian Civil Code - This because of the duties established by the rules of the London Regulatory Authority and because of the need  possibly by both parties  to comply with the due proceedings before the formalization of the entry of Cadogan into the capital of Proger Ingegneria - Subordinated the stipulation of the final contract to the precedent completion of the proceeding and bureaucratic process as per the British rules  stating that  otherwise - There is the obligation on Proger Ingegneria to return the money received under the Loan Agreement.Cadogan introduced an appeal  still pending with a next hearing on September 2025  on the qualification of the Call Option as a preliminary contract.Meanwhile  having taken note of the content of the Award of July 2022  Cadogan repeatedly invited Proger to implement the provisions of the Award. When the invitation remained unsuccessful  Cadogan with a formal notice contested Proger's refusal. This refusal was in direct contrast with the clear and unequivocal provision of the Award  which expressly subordinates the possible transfer of shareholdings to the prior fulfilment of the formalities required by English law and procedures related to Cadogan as a listed company on the London Stock Exchange. Furthermore  Proger behaved and continue to behave in a manner that has made it definitely impossible to the occurrence of the condition precedent referred to in the above-mentioned Award.According to the provisions of the aforementioned Award  the right to reimbursement of the amount covered by the Loan Agreement has arisen in favour of Cadogan  plus interest accrued  and of which Cadogan then demanded immediate payment.Last November 2023  Cadogan had to initiate a second arbitration  with a first audience fixed for the 3rd May 2024  to assert its right to restitution and obtain Proger's condemnation of the consequent payment.OutlookDespite the continuous difficulties and tremendous challenges imposed by the war in Ukraine  the Group has demonstrated its ability to have profitable activities  develop sustainable new activities and diversify in more environmentally friendly activities.Regarding the Loan provided to Proger in February 2019  Cadogan will continue to engage all necessary legal actions to protect its interests and recover the cumulated amount due by Proger.The Group is expecting another challenging year and is seeking to mitigate these constraints through several options and solutions. The diversification along the energy value chain will be pursued and accelerated in 2024 with new sustainable initiatives.This strategy is totally aligned with the Climate Change requirements for sustainability of Cadogan's activities.Fady KhalloufChief Executive Officer07 May 2024Operations ReviewOverviewAt 31 December 2023  the Group held working interests in one conventional gas  condensate and oil exploration and production license in the west of Ukraine.Summary of the Group's licenses (as at 31 December 2023) Working interest (%) License Expiry License type 100 Blazhiv November 2039 Exploration and ProductionWest UkraineE&P activity remained focused on maintaining its license and safely and efficiently producing from the existing wells as well as implementing non-invasive production enhancement scenarios within the Blazhiv oil field.Blazhivska licenseIn 2023  the daily average net oil production reached 326 barrels per day  indicating a 1% increase compared to 2022's production of 323 barrels per day. Due to the ongoing war and its impacts on the energy infrastructures and market the company could not avoid temporary production shutdowns.In 2023  the Company maintained its focus on the subsoil study of the Blazhiv field  building upon the laid in 2022 with the processing and reinterpretation of old 2D seismic data. In 2023  Cadogan completed comprehensive hydrodynamic surveys of Blazhiv-1  Blazhiv-3  Blazhiv-Monastyrets-3  and Blazhiv-10  leading to updates of the hydrodynamic model and production indicators. Furthermore  the Company initiated a new assessment of hydrocarbon reserves conducted by an independent expert  as per to PRMS standards. This assessment was calculated as at 31 December 2023.Cadogan has signed agreements with PJSC Ukrnafta to extend the lease for wells Blazhiv-3 and Blazhiv-Monastyrets-3  extending the duration from three to five years. These extensions were secured before the contracts expired  ensuring uninterrupted production and steady cash flows for the company. Additionally  the extended lease period  five years instead of three previously  will facilitate more secure planning and assessment for potential interventions on the wells.Gas tradingDue to the significant market volatility resulting from the ongoing in Ukraine  Cadogan has maintained its trading activity at a low level. Despite this cautious approach  Cadogan executed few deals and secured 0.7 million m3  as resource reserve for future trading activities.ServiceThe Group continued to provide services through its wholly owned subsidiary Astroservice LLC. The provided services were primarily focused on serving intra-group operational needs in wells' re-entry/repairs and stimulation operations  well surveys and field on-site activities. In the context of the prevailing situation in Ukraine  the services segment was dedicated totally to supporting the Group's production activities.Other eventsThe Company completed the acquisition of the 5% of the share interest in Usenco Nadra LLC and now holds 100% of Usenco Nadra LLC. Such consolidation has allowed to re-engineer the corporate structure in Ukraine and become more efficient.Financial ReviewOverviewIn 2023  the Group had few trading operations and its oil production increased by 1%. The Group's operating divisions delivered a positive contribution of $2.2 million (2022: positive contribution of $2.9 million excluding the impairment of oil and gas assets).The average realised oil price decreased by 19% from $73.4 to $59.3 per barrel.The cash position increased to $14.2 million as at 31 December 2023 compared to $13.9 million as at 31 December 2022.The trading business company bought and sold gas throughout the year  resulting in a negative $61 000 outcome for the year. However  at the end of the year  the company had a gas surplus worth $213 000 in monetary equivalent.Income statementThe Revenues from production decreased from $8.5 million in 2022 to $7.6 million in 2023. This result is integrating mainly a decrease in oil average realised prices by 19%  and E&P costs of sales almost at the same level: $5.39 million in 2023 and $5.55 million in 2022. These costs include production royalties and taxes  fees paid for the rented wells  depreciations  depletion of producing wells  direct staff costs and other costs for exploration and development. Overall  in 2023  E&P made a positive contribution of $2.2 million (2022: $2.9 million) to gross profit.The gas trading business contributed with a slightly gross margin of $3 000 in 2023 (2022: $nil).Administrative expenses (""G&A"") remained contained with an increase of 6% compared to year 2022  note 8.Balance sheetThe Property Plant & Equipment (PP&E) balance was $5.8 million at 31 December 2023 (2022: $6.6 million). It primarily represents the carrying value of the assets invested and engaged in Blazhiv license. The E&E and PP&E are held by Ukrainian subsidiaries with functional currency Ukrainian Hryvna. The Ukrainian Hryvna was devaluated by 3% as at 31 December 2023 compared to 31 December 2022  generating a movement in the E&E and PP&E value presented in the US Dollar.Trade and other receivables of $0.3 million (2022: $0.3 million) include $0.2 million of recoverable VAT (2022: $0.1 million)  which is expected to be recovered through production activities  and $0.1 million (2022: $0.2 million) of other receivables.Inventories slightly increased from $0.3 million to $0.4million principally due to the increase of gas in the stock.The Proger loan was held at amortised cost at $17.1 million (2022: $15.8 million). Refer to the Chief Executive's Report for further details together with note 4(d) and 28.The $1.4 million of trade and other payables as at 31 December 2023 (2022: $1.4 million) consist of $0.8 million (2022: $0.6 million) of accrued expenses and $0.6 million (2022: $0.8 million) of other payables.Provisions include $0.2 million (2022: $0.4 million) of long-term and current provisions for decommissioning costs which represents the present value of these costs that are expected to be incurred in 2039 for producing assets  when the existing Blazhiv license will expire  and current provision for the decommissioning costs of the Bitlyanska license.Net cash slightly increased to $14.2 million at 31 December 2023 compared to $13.9 million at 31 December 2022.Cash flow statementThe Consolidated Cash Flow Statement on page 78 shows operating cash outflow before movements in working capital of $0.6 million (2022: inflow of $0.2 million)  which represents mostly cash generated by the E&P net of corporate expenses.Related party transactionsRelated party transactions are set out in note 30 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.TreasuryThe Group continually monitors its exposure to currency risk. It maintains a portfolio of cash mainly in US dollars (""USD"") and Euro held primarily in the UK. Production revenues from the sale of hydrocarbons are received in Hryvna  the local currency in Ukraine. Since the martial law established in February 2022 in Ukraine  the cash generated in Ukraine must be kept in Hryvna in Ukraine.Risks and uncertaintiesThere are several potential risks and uncertainties that could have a material impact on the Group's long-term performance and could cause the results to differ materially from expected and historical results. Executive management review the potential risks and then classify them as having a high impact if above $5 million  medium impact if above $1 million but below $5 million  and low impact if below $1 million. They also assess the likelihood of these risks occurring. Risk mitigation factors are reviewed and documented based on the level and likelihood of occurrence. The Audit Committee reviews the risk register and monitors the implementation of risk mitigation procedures via Executive management  who are carrying out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the Group  including those potentially threatening its business model  future performance  solvency and liquidity.The Group has analysed the following categories as key risks:Risk Mitigation War risks Since Spring 2021  Russia has gradually increased the concentration of military equipment  weapons and troops near the Ukrainian borders. On 24 February 2022  the Russian troops attacked Ukraine and invaded its territory. Severe fights have been engaged in Kyiv  and several other main cities like Kharkiv  Mariupol  Kherson  Sumy and Chernihiv. Missile attacks and bombing are used by the Russian troops to destroy infrastructures and facilities even in the western cities  like Lviv. Cyber-attacks have increased. Given the unpredictability of the issue of this war  a full-scale invasion of Ukraine or a much longer duration of this war could have material impacts on the Group's operations and on its human  industrial and financial resources. In 2023  the situation remained highly challenging and complicated with the possibility for further escalation. Anticipating the beginning of the war  the Group put in place  since the beginning of February 2022  emergency procedures communicated to all employees on the different sites in Ukraine with an Emergency Committee communicating every day. Safety measures have been dispatched with a remote working organization. Specific measures have been put in place for the operations on site. In case of need  specific measures were put in place to suspend the operations of the Blazhiv field wells  with technical measures for decommissioning and temporary conservation of the wells. The transmission and internet connection systems have been secured with a satellite connection. IT security has been reinforced. The Group is monitoring the situation daily and taking appropriate action to ensure the safety and the essential needs of its employees. In 2023  Cadogan employees in Ukraine continued operating in the combined (remote/ office) work mode with the key focus on the safety measures. Operational risks Health  Safety and Environment (""HSE"") The oil and gas industry by its nature conducts activities  which can cause health  safety and environmental incidents. Serious incidents can have not only a financial impact but can also damage the Group's reputation and the opportunity to undertake further projects. The Group maintains a HSE management system in place and demands that management  staff and contractors adhere to it. The system ensures that the Group meets Ukrainian legislative standards and for the CO2 emissions the British standards and achieves international standards to the maximum extent possible. Management systems and processes have been certified as ISO 14001 and ISO 45001 compliant. Climate change After the Paris Agreement (COP 21) the international community is committed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to slow down the climate change and contain its effects. Countries may impose moratorium on E&P activities or enact tight limits to emissions level  which may curtail production. Shareholders may also request that the Company adopt stringent targets in terms of emissions reduction. A moratorium on domestic production is deemed highly unlikely in Ukraine given the country's need for affordable energy. Such risks exist in Italy  but the Group's exposure there is limited. Management strives to reduce emissions in everything the Group does and has started implementing alternatives to offset and/or mitigate emissions. In 2023  the Group has reviewed its administrative and operational process to identify the areas of further improvement in the limitation of its environmental impact. The Group has launched its gas-to-power project on its Blazhiv oil field in Ukraine. The aim of this project is to capture the gas emissions during oil production and use them to generate electricity to be sold on the grid. This project will allow to decrease significantly Cadogan's annual emissions with the intensity ratio emission to drop from 126 to 32 tons of CO2 e/Kboe. The project will be operational in Q1 2025. For the future  Cadogan will continue to diversify its activities by investing in new activities with a lower impact on environment. Drilling and Work-Over operations The technical difficulty of drilling or re-entering wells in the Group's locations and equipment limitations can result in the unsuccessful completion of the well. The incorporation of detailed sub-surface analysis into a robustly engineered well design and work programme  with appropriate procurement procedures and competent on-site management  aims to minimise risk. Only certified personnel are hired to operate on the rig floor. Contractor's access to the operational sites is allowed only after control of staff qualification and check-up of appropriate technical condition of the equipment and machinery Production and maintenance There is a risk that production or transportation facilities could fail due to non-adequate maintenance  control or poor performance of the Group's suppliers. All plants are operated and maintained at standards above the Ukrainian minimum legal requirements. Operative staff are experienced and receive supplemental training to ensure that facilities are properly operated and maintained. When not in use the facilities are properly kept under conservation and routinely monitored. Service providers are rigorously reviewed at the tender stage and are monitored during the contract period. Sub-surface risks The success of the business relies on accurate and detailed analysis of the sub-surface. This can be impacted by poor quality data  either historic or recently gathered  and limited coverage. Certain information provided by external sources may not be accurate. All externally provided and historic data is rigorously examined and discarded when appropriate. New data acquisition is considered  and appropriate programmes implemented  but historic data can be reviewed and reprocessed to improve the overall knowledge base. Agreements with qualified local and international contractors have been entered into to supplement and broaden the pool of expertise available to the Company. Data can be misinterpreted leading to the construction of inaccurate models and subsequent plans. All analytical outcomes are challenged internally and peer reviewed. Analysis is performed using modern geological software. The area available for drilling operations is limited due to logistics  infrastructures and moratorium. This increases the risk for setting optimum well coordinates. Bottom hole locations are always checked for their operational feasibility  well trajectory  rig type  and verified on updated sub-surface models. They are rejected if deemed to be too risky. The Group may not be successful in proving commercial production from its licenses and consequently the carrying values of the Group's oil and gas assets may have to be impaired. The Group performs  on an annual basis  a review of its oil and gas assets  impairs if necessary  and considers whether to commission a review from a third party or a Competent Person's Report (""CPR"") from an independent qualified contractor depending on the circumstances. Financial risks The Group is at risk from changes in the economic environment both in Ukraine and globally  which can cause foreign exchange movements  changes in the rate of inflation and interest rates and lead to credit risk in relation to the Group's key counterparties. The martial law in Ukraine forbids the transfer of cash outside of Ukraine. The cash held in Ukraine must be held in the local currency (Hryvna). The decrease of the value of the Hryvna is a major risk on the cash held by the Group in Ukraine. Since the martial law in Ukraine  there is an obligation to keep the cash held by Cadogan in Ukraine in Hryvna with period restrictions for transfers out of the Country. In February 2019  Cadogan entered into a 2-year Loan Agreement (Euros 13.385 million) with Proger Management & Partners with a Call Option that could be exercised by Cadogan  between September 2019 and February 2021  with no obligation  allowing a 33 % equity interest in Proger Ingegneria. This represented a key transaction and element of the Group balance sheet. At 25 February 2021  being the Maturity Date  Cadogan did not exercise its Call Option and PMP must reimburse Euros 14 857 350. End of March 2021  PMP did not reimburse and asked for an arbitration to get the Loan Agreement recognized as an equity investment contract. Revenues in Ukraine are received in hryvnia and expenditure is made in Hryvnia. The Group continues to hold most of its cash reserves in the UK mostly in USD and Euro. Cash reserves are placed with leading financial institutions  which are approved by the Audit Committee. Before the war in Ukraine  foreign exchange risk was considered a normal and acceptable business exposure  and the Group did not hedge against this risk for its E&P operations. The Group is currently analysing different options. The terms of the agreement are clear and include the right to repayment at maturity if the Call Option is not exercised. As security for the reimbursement of the loan  Cadogan benefits from a pledge over the shares held by Proger Managers & Partners in Proger Ingegneria. In addition to that  Cadogan is engaging all the necessary actions in the Arbitration process and more generally the adequate legal actions to protect the interests of the Company and all of its stakeholders. The investigation is closed. On 28 July 2022  the Arbitration Committee delivered an award rejecting Proger's request  established that the Loan Agreement was valid and effective  and indicated the conditions precedent for the completion of any transaction with Proger Ingegneria. In case of non-completion  Proger must reimburse Cadogan according to the Loan Agreement. Refer to note 28 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for detail on financial risks. The Group is at risk that counterparties will default on their contractual obligations resulting in a financial loss to the Group. Procedures are in place to scrutinize new counterparties via a Know Your Customer (""KYC"") process  which covers their solvency. In addition  when trading gas  the Group seeks to reduce the risk of customer non-performance by limiting the title transfer to product until the payment is received  prepaying only to known credible suppliers. The Group is at risk that fluctuations in gas prices will have a negative result for the trading operations resulting in a financial loss to the Group. The Group mostly enters back-to-back transactions where the price is known at the time of committing to purchase and sell the product. Sometimes the Group takes exposure to open inventory positions when justified by the market conditions in Ukraine  which is supported by analysis of the specific transactions  market trends and models of the gas prices and foreign exchange rate trends.Country risks Legislative changes may bring unexpected risk and create delays in securing licenses or ultimately prevent licenses and license renewals /conversions from being secured. Compliance procedures  monitoring and appropriate dialogue with the relevant authorities are maintained to minimise the risk. In all cases  deployment of capital in Ukraine is limited and investments are kept at the level required to fulfil license obligations. Other risks The Group's success depends upon skilled management as well as technical and administrative staff. The loss of service of critical members from the Group's team could have an adverse effect on the business. The Group periodically reviews the compensation and contract terms of its staff in order to remain a competitive employer in the markets where it operates. The Group is at risk of underestimating the risk and complexity associated with the entry into new countries. The Group applies rigorous screening criteria in order to evaluate potential investment opportunities. It also seeks input from independent and qualified experts when deemed necessary. Additionally  the required rate of return is adjusted to the perceived level of risk. Local communities and stakeholders may cause delays to the project execution and postpone activities. The Group maintains a transparent and open dialogue with authorities and stakeholders (i) to identify their needs and propose solutions which address them as well as (ii) to illustrate the activities which it intends to conduct and the measures to mitigate their impact. Local needs and protection of the environment are always taken into consideration when designing mitigation measures  which may go beyond the legislative minimum requirement. The Group devotes the highest level of attention and engage qualified consultants to prepare the Environmental Impact Assessment studies and to attend public hearings  both introduced in Ukraine in 2019.Statement of Reserves and ResourcesIn 2023  the company conducted routine rig-less production support activities at the Blazhiv-1  Blazhiv-3 and Blazhiv-Monastyrets-3 and Blazhiv-10 wells to maintain sustainable production using sucker rod pumping systems.Summary of Reserves1at 31 December 2023Mmboe Proved  Probable and Possible Reserves at 1 January 2023 3.94 Production 0.12 Revisions 0.77 Proved  Probable and Possible Reserves at 31 December 2023 3.0511 The new study was completed end of February 2024 by Brend Vik LTD LLC. The last independent valuation of the Company's oil and gas reserves was carried out by Brend-Vik LTD LLC as at 31 December 2023.In addition to the tabled reserves  Cadogan has 0.64 million boe of 2C contingent resources associated with the Blazhiv license.Corporate ResponsibilityUnder Section 414C of the Companies Act 2006 (the ""Act"")  the Board is required to disclose information about environmental matters  employees  human rights and community issues  including information about any policies it has in relation to these matters and the effectiveness of these policies.Being sustainable in our activities means conducting our business with respect for the environment and for the communities hosting us  with the aim of increasing the benefit and value to our stakeholders. We recognize that this is a key element to be competitive and to maintain our license to operate.The Board recognises that the protection of the health and safety of its employees  the communities  and the environment in which it operates is not just an obligation but is part of the personal ethics and beliefs of management and staff. These are the key drivers for a sustainable development of the Company's activity. Cadogan Petroleum  its management and employees are committed to continuously improve Health  Safety and Environment (HSE) performance; follow our Code of Ethics and apply  in conducting our operations  internationally recognized best practices and standards.Our activities are carried out in accordance with a policy manual  endorsed by the Board  which has been disseminated to all staff. The manual includes a Working with Integrity policy and policies on business conduct and ethics  anti-bribery  the acceptance of gifts and hospitality and whistleblowing. Such policies are subject to regular review.In August 2018  Cadogan Ukraine LLC obtained ISO 14001 and ISO 45001 certifications for the following scope: ""Supervision  coordination  management support  control in the field of oil and gas onshore exploration and production."" This provides formal recognition of the process embedded in the Company and demonstrates the commitment and efforts delivered by our employees and management. It is considered a baseline to continue with the efforts to improve the way we conduct the business.The Board believes that health and safety procedures  and training across the Group should be in line with best practice in the oil and gas sector. Accordingly  it has set up a committee to review and agree on the health and safety initiatives for the Company and to report back to the Board on the progress of these initiatives. Management regularly reports to the Board on HSE and key safety and environmental issues  which are discussed at the Executive Management level. The report of the Health  Safety and Environment Committee can be found on page 40 to 41.The General Director of Cadogan Ukraine is the acting Chairman of the HSE Committee and is supported in his role by Cadogan Ukraine's HSE Manager. In accordance with the ISO 14001 and ISO 45001  his role is to ensure that the Group continuously develops suitable procedures  that operational management and their teams incorporate them into daily operations and that the HSE management has the necessary level of autonomy and authority to discharge their duties effectively and efficiently.Health  safety and environment2023 remained extremely challenging due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the resulting subsequent war. Cadogan applied measures to mitigate the risk personnel injuries and loss of well control. Kiev office personnel have been working in the combined office-remote work regime with precise execution of air alert safety requirements  on-field staff as well as all offices have been equipped with satellite means of communication  established internal emergency committee that coordinated the work and liaising with company management of the daily basis. One employee has been demobilized from army during 2023  two remained serving.Also  the HSE management daily monitors health status of the personnel in terms of covid-19.The Group has implemented an integrated HSE management system in accordance with the ISO requirements. The system aims to ensure that a safe and environmentally friendly/protection culture is embedded in the organization with a focus on the local community involvement. The HSE management system ensures that both Ukrainian and international standards are met  with the Ukrainian HSE legislation requirements taken as an absolute minimum. All the Group's local operating companies actively participate in the process. ISO 14001 and ISO 45001 certification were re-validated by the respective authority in August 2023 for a new term.A proactive approach based on a detailed induction process and near miss reporting has been in place throughout 2023 to prevent incidents. Staff training on HSE matters and discussions on near miss reporting are recognised as the key factors to continuously improve. In-house training is provided to help staff meet international standards and follow best practice. The process enacted by the certification  enhances attention to training on risk assessments  emergency response  incident prevention  reporting and investigation  as well as emergency drills regularly run-on operations' sites and offices. This process is essential to ensure that international best practices and standards are maintained to comply with  or exceed  those required by Ukrainian legislation  and to promote continuous improvement.The Board monitors the main Key Performance Indicators (lost time incidents  mileage driven  training received  CO2 emissions) as business parameters. The Board has benchmarked safety performance against the HSE performance index measured and published annually by the International Association of Oil and Gas Producers. In 2023  the Group recorded over 149 000 man-hours worked with no incidents and over 1 720 000 hours have been worked since the last injury in February 2016.During 2023 the Group continued to monitor its greenhouse gas emissions and collect statistical data relating to the consumption of electricity  industrial water and fuel consumption by cars  plants  and other work sites  recording a continuous improvement in the efficient use of resources.EmployeesWellness and professional development are part of the Company's sustainable development policy and wherever possible  local staff are recruited. The Group's activity in Ukraine is entirely managed by local staff. Qualified local contractors are engaged to supplement the required expertise when and to the extent it is necessary.Procedures are in place to ensure that recruitment is undertaken on an open  transparent  and fair basis with no discrimination against applicants. Each operating company has its own Human Resources function to ensure that the Group's employment policies are properly implemented and followed. The Group's Human Resources policy covers key areas such as equal opportunities  wages  overtime and non-discrimination. As required by Ukrainian legislation  Collective Agreements are in place with the Group's Ukrainian subsidiary companies  which outline agreed level of staff benefits and other safeguards for employees.All staff are aware of the Group's grievance procedures. All employees have access to health insurance provided by the Group to ensure that all employees have access to adequate medical facilities.Each employee's training needs are assessed on an individual basis to ensure that their skills are adequate to support the Group's operations  and to help them to develop.DiversityThe Board recognises the benefits and importance of diversity (gender  ethnic  age  sex  disability  educational and professional backgrounds  etc.) and strives to apply diversity values across the business. We endeavour to employ a skilled workforce that reflects the demographic of the jurisdictions in which we operate.

Also  the used methodology was also updated based on methods proposed by DNV GL and in of GHG emissions Inventory referring to the following guidelines and international standards.The Company has reported on all the emission sources required under the Regulations.The Company does not have responsibility for any emission sources that are not included in its consolidated statement.Consolidation approach and organisation boundaryAn operational control approach was used to define the Company's organisational boundary and responsibility for GHG emissions. All material emission sources within this boundary have been reported upon  in line with the requirements of the Regulations.Scope of reported emissionsEmissions data from the sources within Scope 1 and Scope 2 of the Company's operational boundaries is detailed below. This includes direct emissions from assets that fall within the Company's organisational boundaries (Scope 1 emissions)  as well as indirect emissions from energy consumption  such as purchased electricity and heating (Scope 2 emissions).Scope 1 emissions in 2023 has insignificantly increased compared to the previous year (14 933 tons in 2023 vs 14 631 tons in 2022). This was caused by the increase of the annual oil production.Conversely  Scope 2 emissions decreased in 2023 (111 tons in 2023 vs 124 tons in 2022)  as a result of the processes started in 2016 to improve the efficiency of the structure  logistic and facilities. Total emissions in 2023 were 15 044 tons versus the 14 755 tons of 2022.Intensity ratioIn order to express the GHG emissions in relation to a quantifiable factor associated with the Company's activities  wellhead production of crude oil and natural gas has been chosen as the normalisation factor for calculating the intensity ratio. This will allow comparison of the Company's performance over time  as well as with other companies in the Company's peer group.The intensity ratio for E&P operations (same reporting perimeter) has insignificantly increased to 126 36tons CO2e/Kboe in 2023 vs 125 26 tons CO2e/Kboe in 2022.Total greenhouse gas emissions data for the year from 1 January to 31 December.The company conducted a planned repetition of bottomhole oil sampling and analyses during 2023 hydrodynamic surveys of Blazhiv wells to reconcile the associated gas composition data. The repetitive analyses confirmed an increase in methane levels in the gas composition causing an increase in the reported emissions level last year. As previously mentioned in the report  the implementation of the electricity generation project utilising associated gas will lead to a substantial reduction in the CO2 emissions into the atmosphere starting from 2025.Greenhouse gas emissions source E&P 2023 2022 Scope 1 Direct emissions  including combustion of fuel and operation of facilities (tonnes of CO2 equivalent) 14 933 14 631 Scope 2 Indirect emissions from energy consumption  such as electricity and heating purchased for own use (tonnes of CO2 equivalent) 111 124 Total (Scope 1 & 2) 15 044 14 755 Normalisation factor Barrels of oil equivalent  net 119 057 117 793 Intensity ratio Emissions reported above normalised to tonnes of CO2- per total wellhead production of crude oil  condensates  and natural gas  in thousands of Barrels of Oil Equivalent  net 126 36 125 26Energy consumptionThe Company started in 2020 to monitor energy consumption in KwH.2023 2022 % change KwH KwH 2023 - 2022 Ukraine 557 631 575 876 -3%Energy consumption in the UK is immaterial.Task force on climate-related financial disclosures (`TCFD')Climate change remains one of the Group's principal risks with governance over climate-related transition and physical risks provided at the Board and operational levels. The Board has ultimate accountability for ensuring Cadogan maintains sound climate risk management and internal control systems. The Board is ultimately accountable for Cadogan's strategic response to climate change and the energy transition. Directors are responsible for ensuring they remain sufficiently informed of climate related risks to Cadogan and the broader energy sector. In 2023  the Group has reviewed its administrative and operational process to identify the areas of further improvement in the limitation of its environmental impact. The Group has launched its gas-to-power project on its Blazhiv oil field in Ukraine. The aim of this project is to capture the gas emissions during oil production and use them to generate electricity to be sold on the grid. This project will allow to decrease significantly Cadogan's annual emissions with the intensity ratio emission to drop from 126 to 32 tons of CO2 e/Kboe. The project will be operational in Q1 2025.TCFD related disclosuresGovernance Describe the Board's oversight of climate-related risks and opportunities. p.14-17 Describe Management's role in assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities.

Ms Lilia Jolibois   Independent non-executive director  chaired the Audit Committee whilst Mr Jacques Mahaux   non-independent non-executive director  was a member of the Audit Committee during the year.Provision 32 (Remuneration Committee Composition): Given the size and composition of the Board  the Remuneration Committee does not totally consist of independent non-executive directors.

DBV is currently focused on investigating the use of its proprietary technology platform  Viaskin™  to address food allergies  which are caused by a hypersensitive immune reaction and characterized by a range of symptoms varying in severity from mild to life-threatening anaphylaxis. Millions of people live with food allergies  including young children. Through epicutaneous immunotherapy (EPIT™)  the Viaskin platform is designed to introduce microgram amounts of a biologically active compound to the immune system through intact skin. EPIT is a new class of non-invasive treatment that seeks to modify an individual’s underlying allergy by re-educating the immune system to become desensitized to allergen by leveraging the skin’s immune tolerizing properties. DBV is committed to transforming the care of food allergic people. The Company’s food allergy programs include ongoing clinical trials of Viaskin Peanut in peanut allergic toddlers (1 through 3 years of age) and children (4 through 7 years of age).Story continuesDBV Technologies is headquartered in Montrouge  France  with North American operations in Warren  NJ.
