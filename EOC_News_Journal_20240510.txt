40681,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rt.com/business/597258-eu-russian-assets-profits/,EU agrees to tap Russian assets to arm Ukraine,EU countries have agreed on the expropriation of billions in profits from frozen sovereign Russian funds to continue arming Kiev Read Full Article at RT.com,The bloc wants to seize the revenue generated from $200 billion of the frozen fundsThe EU has agreed on the expropriation of revenue generated from frozen Russian assets to continue funding and arming Kiev  Brussels announced on Wednesday. The bloc’s ambassadors agreed on the course of action “in principle ” but the legal text still must be ratified by the EU Council.The proposal targets the proceeds from €191 billion ($205 billion) in Russian funds currently held in Belgian clearinghouse Euroclear. In total  Western states froze an estimated $300 billion of Moscow’s sovereign capital abroad after the start of the Ukraine conflict in February 2022.“EU ambassadors agreed in principle on measures concerning extraordinary revenues stemming from Russia’s immobilized assets ” the Belgian presidency announced on X (formerly Twitter) on Wednesday.Euroclear generates €2-3 billion in profits annually from the Russian money  depending on the interest rates  according to CEO Valerie Urbain.Under the proposal  the EU hopes to send 90% of the profits towards purchasing armaments for Ukraine  and 10% towards non-military aid  with the first tranche expected in July.“There could be no stronger symbol and no greater use for that money than to make Ukraine and all of Europe a safer place to live ” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said.Belgium will continue levying a 25% corporate tax on the revenue  while Euroclear will keep 10% before the money is sent to the EU  to provide the clearinghouse a buffer against ongoing and future litigation by Russia. Euroclear will also keep 0.3% of future profits as an incentive fee.The move follows months of deliberation among Ukraine’s Western backers on how best to utilize Russia’s frozen funds. The US – Kiev’s biggest war sponsor – had proposed seizing the assets entirely  but has faced pushback from the EU thus far.Euroclear’s CEO likened the confiscation of frozen Russian funds to “opening Pandora’s box.” Speaking to L’Echo on Tuesday  she warned it could cause “major international investors to turn away from Europe ” as they could no longer trust that their own assets would not be confiscated.Russia stressed that seizing its sovereign capital or any similar action would not only amount to theft and violate international law  but undermine trust in both Western currencies and the global financial system.If the frozen Russian assets are seized  Moscow will retaliate in kind  Finance Minister Anton Siluanov warned in February. Total foreign direct investments in the Russian economy by the EU  G7  Australia  and Switzerland were estimated to be around $288 billion at the end of 2022.,neutral,0.13,0.68,0.2,negative,0.03,0.31,0.66,True,English,"['Russian assets', 'EU', 'Ukraine', 'President Ursula von der Leyen', 'Finance Minister Anton Siluanov', 'Total foreign direct investments', 'biggest war sponsor', 'global financial system', 'major international investors', 'CEO Valerie Urbain', 'frozen Russian assets', 'Belgian clearinghouse Euroclear', 'Belgian presidency', 'international law', 'frozen funds', 'Russian economy', 'legal text', 'Western states', 'sovereign capital', 'extraordinary revenues', 'interest rates', 'non-military aid', 'first tranche', 'stronger symbol', 'greater use', 'safer place', 'European Commission', '25% corporate tax', 'future litigation', 'incentive fee', 'Western backers', 'The US', 'L’Echo', 'Western currencies', 'Russian funds', 'immobilized assets', 'Russian money', 'similar action', 'future profits', 'EU Council', 'Ukraine conflict', 'EU ambassadors', 'bloc', 'expropriation', 'funding', 'Kiev', 'Brussels', 'Wednesday', 'course', 'principle', 'proposal', 'proceeds', 'Moscow', 'start', 'February', 'measures', 'Twitter', 'armaments', 'July', 'Belgium', 'buffer', 'ongoing', 'move', 'months', 'deliberation', 'pushback', 'confiscation', 'Pandora', 'box', 'Tuesday', 'theft', 'trust', 'kind', 'Australia', 'Switzerland', 'end']",2024-05-09,2024-05-10,rt.com

The bloc said the first payments could be made by the summer  despite calls by Washington for its European allies to go much further and fully seize Russia’s billions for the benefit of Kyiv.EU officials welcomed the agreement. Writing on X  formerly Twitter  EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Thursday  ""there could be no stronger symbol and no greater use for that money than to make Ukraine and all of Europe a safer place to live.""The EU’s Trade Commissioner  Valdis Dombrovskis  wrote that the first $1 billon should be available by the summer  mainly for military support. ""Russia will pay directly for its crimes "" Dombrovskis said.Assets frozenWestern financial institutions and companies are holding billions of dollars of cash and assets of Russia’s central bank  which were frozen by Europe and the United States in the wake of Moscow’s February 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. About 70% of the assets  amounting to more than $200 billion  are held in Brussels at Euroclear  a financial services company and clearing house that specializes in cross-border securities transactions and the safe-keeping of assets.The United States  along with Britain and Canada  have been pushing for those assets to be fully seized and used to help Kyiv fight Russia’s invasion. Last month  Washington passed legislation allowing it to seize Russian foreign currency reserves within the United States to fund weapons for Ukraine.European cautionHowever  Europe is being more cautious. European Union ambassadors meeting in Brussels Wednesday agreed in principle to use only the interest earned on the Russian assets.Ian Bond  a foreign policy analyst and Russia specialist at the Center for European Reform  said Brussels could go further.""What the EU is talking about is not seizing the principal - but using the interest  which might amount to seven or $8 billion a year and using that for the benefit of Ukraine "" Bond told VOA. ""It’s a worthwhile sum of money  but it is a tiny sum of money compared to the amount of damage that Russia has done to Ukraine and the amount of money that Ukraine needs to keep its government services and its war effort going.""The deal should be fully signed off at an EU finance ministers’ meeting on May 14.German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said the bloc must act quickly to support Ukraine.""The funds available there can be used not only for procurement (of weapons) within Europe  but also outside Europe. Because what really matters now is that weapons can be delivered as quickly as possible "" Scholz said Monday during a visit to Latvia.EU fearsSome in Europe fear that the U.S. plan to fully seize Russia’s assets would trigger a lengthy legal battle and may prompt other countries like China to sell their euro investments  destabilizing the currency.Neutral EU states  including Hungary and Austria  objected to using the profits to buy Ukraine weapons. The EU has secured their agreement by ringfencing around 10 per cent of the Russian windfall profits for humanitarian aid.Russian retaliationRussia last month warned the West against seizing its assets. ""Russian assets must remain untouched because otherwise there will be a severe response to Western thievery "" Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova wrote on Telegram April 28.There are concerns in Europe that Moscow will retaliate by seizing more assets belonging to Western companies still operating in Russia.Those companies may find little sympathy in the West  suggests analyst Ian Bond.""My view on that is these companies have had two years to get out of the Russian market. If they stayed in  it was because they thought it was okay to continue to earn money in Russia  despite the fact that it was waging a brutal war of aggression against one of its neighbors. And if they lose their shirts now  that's their tough luck "" he said.""There are European assets in Russia that the Russian government could seize. And it has in some cases already seized the assets of Western private companies in Russia. But I don’t think that the amounts would match up "" Bond added.EU officials hope the deal will be fully implemented by June  when Hungary is due to take over the rotating EU Council presidency. Analysts say there are concerns within the EU that Hungary’s Prime Minister Viktor Orban could try to block the deal if it isn’t fully signed off by then  as he seeks to maintain close ties with Russia.",neutral,0.08,0.57,0.35,mixed,0.14,0.3,0.56,True,English,"['frozen Russian assets', 'Ukraine weapons', 'Europe', 'profits', 'EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen', 'Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova', 'Prime Minister Viktor Orban', 'EU finance ministers’ meeting', 'rotating EU Council presidency', 'German Chancellor Olaf Scholz', 'Russian foreign currency reserves', 'foreign policy analyst', 'cross-border securities transactions', 'lengthy legal battle', 'Western financial institutions', 'financial services company', 'European Union ambassadors', 'Neutral EU states', 'February 2022 full-scale invasion', 'The European Union', 'Russian windfall profits', 'The United States', 'analyst Ian Bond', 'Western private companies', 'Russian retaliation', 'Russian market', 'Russian government', 'EU officials', 'EU fears', 'government services', 'Western thievery', 'European allies', 'European caution', 'European Reform', 'Western companies', 'Russian assets', 'first payments', 'stronger symbol', 'greater use', 'safer place', 'Trade Commissioner', 'first $1 billon', 'military support', 'central bank', 'clearing house', 'worthwhile sum', 'tiny sum', 'war effort', 'U.S.', 'other countries', 'euro investments', '10 per cent', 'humanitarian aid', 'severe response', 'little sympathy', 'two years', 'brutal war', 'tough luck', 'close ties', 'European assets', 'Valdis Dombrovskis', 'Russia specialist', 'Ukraine weapons', 'principle', 'deal', 'proceeds', 'bloc', 'summer', 'calls', 'Washington', 'billions', 'benefit', 'Kyiv', 'agreement', 'Twitter', 'money', 'crimes', 'dollars', 'cash', 'wake', 'Moscow', 'Brussels', 'Euroclear', 'safe-keeping', 'Britain', 'Canada', 'legislation', 'interest', 'Center', 'principal', 'VOA.', 'amount', 'damage', 'May', 'funds', 'procurement', 'visit', 'Latvia', 'China', 'Hungary', 'Austria', 'Telegram', 'concerns', 'view', 'fact', 'aggression', 'neighbors', 'shirts', 'cases', 'June', 'Analysts']",2024-05-09,2024-05-10,voanews.com

We remain confident and determined to pursue our strategic vision  despite the complex and uncertain international context. We will continue to invest in the development of Pisa and Florence airports  with a special focus on sustainability as a key growth driver for the Toscana Aeroporti Group."" Passenger and cargo traffic results at March 31  2024 With approximately 1.5 million passengers handled overall in the first quarter of the year  the Tuscan Airport System hit a new traffic record  up +13.9% compared the same period of 2023. This result was driven by the increase in total flights (+9.4%) and in the load factor of scheduled traffic (+2.4 percentage points to 83.9%) in the first quarter of 2024. With 3 115 tons of goods and mail  cargo traffic decreased by 7.3% compared to the same period of 2023. Pisa Galileo Galilei airport At March 31  2024  Pisa airport handled 855 thousand passengers  with a +4.3% increase compared to 2023. In the reporting period  the load factor of scheduled traffic reached 86.8%  increasing by +2.8 percentage points compared to 2023  whereas total flights declined by 0.8%. Italy was the No. 1 market for Pisa airport  accounting for 29.0% of total traffic  followed by Spain (13.1% of total traffic)  the United Kingdom (12.8%) and Albania (11.8%). With 3 097 tons of carried goods and mail  cargo traffic decreased by 6.7% at March 31  2024 compared to the same period of 2023. 1 Data source: Assaeroporti 1Florence Amerigo Vespucci airport Florence airport hit a record in each individual month of the first quarter of the year  reaching a total of 625 thousand passengers handled  up +30.4% compared to the same period of 2023. National passenger traffic more than doubled by +116.3% and international passenger traffic rose by +21.7%  in a context where the international component accounted for 84.8% of total traffic. The increase in the first quarter was driven by the positive performance of total flights (+20.2%) and by the 80.2% load factor of scheduled traffic (+2.8 pps) compared to 77.4% in 2023. France was the most popular destination among Florence airport's passengers (23.0% of total traffic)  followed by Spain (17.0%) and Italy (15.2%). Consolidated operating results It should first of all be highlighted that the Tuscan Airport System  which is marked by a strong summer seasonality  traditionally records negative profitability margins in the first quarter of the year. Total consolidated revenues reached €20.8 million in the first quarter of 2024  up +6.9% compared to €19.5 million for the same period of 2023. Operating revenues amounted to €18.6 million at March 31  2024  up +16.1% compared to €16.1 million for the same period of 2023. In detail  the higher traffic handled in the first quarter of the year positively impacted both Aviation revenues  amounting to €13.4 million and increasing by +14.5% compared to €11.7 million in 2023  and Non-Aviationrevenues  which stood at €7.7 million  up +17.4% compared to €6.5 million at March 31  2023. Other revenues totaled €1.1 million  decreasing by 55.0% compared to €2.5 million in 2023  due to a decline in the operations of the subsidiary Toscana Aeroporti Costruzioni S.r.l. Revenues from construction services  directly connected with the investments made  amounted to €1.1 million compared to €978 thousand for the first quarter of 2023  with a +13.8% increase. Total consolidated costs for the first quarter of the year were €16.6 million  down 2.7% compared to €17.1 million for the same period of 2023. In detail  costs for services declined by 13.2%  going from €9.5 million to €8.2 million at March 31  2024  chiefly as a result of lower costs for construction services and utilities. The higher traffic handled in the period impacted the increase of both personnel costs  which rose by 10.1% going from €5.8 million to €6.4 million at March 31  2024  and airport fees  which grew by 16.1% to €1.3 million compared to €1.1 million in 2023. As a consequence of the foregoing  EBITDA rose by +64.3% at March 31  2024  going from €2.6 million for the first quarter of 2023 to €4.3 million at March 31  2024. EBITDA margin grew to 20.5%  increasing by 7.2 percentage points compared to 2023. Depreciation  amortization and provisions in the first quarter of the year totaled €3.3 million overall  down 2.3% compared to the same period of 2023. EBIT improved going from a negative €817 thousand in the first quarter of 2023 to a positive €929 thousand at March 31  2024. Net finance costs  which went from a negative €1.5 million to an equally negative €1.7 million  were impacted by higher banking interests accrued on outstanding loans. PBT was negative for €810 thousand  sharply improving compared to a negative €2.3 million for the first quarter of 2023. The Group's net result at March 31  2024 was negative for €654 thousand  improving by €1.1 million compared to a net loss of €1.8 million for the same period of 2023. Investments and financial results The Group's overall investments at March 31  2024 amounted to €1.3 million  essentially referring to Florence airport's terminal project. 2Net financial debt at March 31  2024 was €80.6 million  compared to €79.6 million at December 31  2023 and down compared to €92.2 million for the first quarter of 2023. Cash outflows for the period were mainly attributable to the outstanding loan repayment and to operating activities  partly offset by the sale of the stake in Firenze Parcheggi. The Debt/Equity ratio was 0.76 at March 31  2024. Adjusted net financial debt  i.e.  net of deferred payment commitments for acquisitions and right-of-use financial liabilities  amounted to €75.3 million compared to €74.3 million at December 31  2023 and €85.8 million at March 31  2023.

Outlook In the first quarter of 2024  the Tuscan Airport System handled approximately 2.3 million passengers overall  up +13.2% compared to the same period of 2023 and +6.0% compared to the 2019 pre-pandemic levels. A traffic level exceeding the 2019 pre-Covid volume is expected for 2024  with the ensuing full recovery of operations and margins  despite the context of international tensions triggered by the still ongoing Russia- Ukraine and Israel-Palestine conflicts  which could impact passenger mobility. In 2024  the Company will focus on continuing and finalizing all the activities related to the approval of Florence airport's Master Plan and those instrumental to its implementation  as well as on building Pisa airport's new arrivals terminal. * * * The consolidated financial statements at March 31  2024 are attached hereto.

DBV is currently focused on investigating the use of its proprietary technology platform  Viaskin™  to address food allergies  which are caused by a hypersensitive immune reaction and characterized by a range of symptoms varying in severity from mild to life-threatening anaphylaxis. Millions of people live with food allergies  including young children. Through epicutaneous immunotherapy (EPIT™)  the Viaskin platform is designed to introduce microgram amounts of a biologically active compound to the immune system through intact skin. EPIT is a new class of non-invasive treatment that seeks to modify an individual’s underlying allergy by re-educating the immune system to become desensitized to allergen by leveraging the skin’s immune tolerizing properties. DBV is committed to transforming the care of food allergic people. The Company’s food allergy programs include ongoing clinical trials of Viaskin Peanut in peanut allergic toddlers (1 through 3 years of age) and children (4 through 7 years of age).DBV Technologies is headquartered in Montrouge  France  with North American operations in Warren  NJ.

Great Western Mining Corporation PLC ('Great Western' or the 'Company') explores for  appraises and develops mineral resources on its claims in Nevada  USA but currently has no revenues from its operations. Accordingly  it is reporting a loss after tax of €952 654 for the year (2022: €792 263). At the year end the Company's net assets were €8 831 416 (2022: €8 618 024). The highlight of Great Western's exploration activity in 2023 was the establishment through intensive fieldwork of a copper porphyry in the Huntoon Valley  where Great Western holds 760 claims. A granite outcrop associated with a porphyry  previously and erroneously shown as tertiary cover on official government maps  was identified and 2 km² (490 acres) of ground was sampled in the immediate vicinity  resulting in consistent  strong copper readings. An expert consultant on porphyry systems was invited to the site in October and spent a week in the field reviewing the porphyry potential  subsequently confirming it in a formal report which the Company has published. This is a really significant development for Great Western and raises the possibility  not yet proven  of connectivity  across the Huntoon Valley  with both the M2 claims to the northeast where the Company has already established a copper resource and the M4 prospects to the east  where the Company's limited drilling activity has established very promising copper anomalies. These three main prospect areas  West Huntoon  M2 and M4 have now been internally grouped together and categorised as the Huntoon Copper Project. An expired agreement with Crowne Point Resources  owner of land equivalent to six federal claims around the historic Huntoon Gold Mine  has been novated since the year end and this land will provide surface and road access for early drilling. Since the end of the year  the Company has conducted a geophysical survey to track and measure the continuation of the porphyry system under tertiary cover  where data cannot be obtained through grab and soil sampling  initially yielding positive results. During the 2023 field season  Great Western had two geologists working full time in the field  sampling and mapping a number of prospects  under the direction of the Company's Exploration Manager  Dr James Blight. The sampling carried out around the granite extrusion at West Huntoon also identified unrelated epithermal gold and silver in the same area  including a bonanza silver result. In addition to the West Huntoon area  the team also worked extensively on the M5 prospect in the JS group of claims and on the Rhyolite Dome prospect at the Olympic Gold Project  both of which look highly prospective for precious metals. In April 2024 Great Western exercised its option to purchase the Olympic Gold project and made the final option final payment. There is little doubt that taking an option on Olympic was a good decision in 2020 and the claims are an excellent  complementary add-on to the Company's other claim areas  50 miles away on the other side of Mineral County. The OMCO Mine produced gold at high grades in the early part of the last century and Great Western has already discovered an extension to the OMCO vein. Good intercepts have already been encountered through drilling at the Trafalgar Hill prospect in the east of this 800 acre project area and Rhyolite Dome to the south of the project is potentially large  interesting and has never been drilled. Large quantities of pre-mined material at Olympic Gold is of higher quality and is more accessible than the spoil heaps at the Company's Mineral Jackpot claims  so will enhance the viability of the Company's milling joint venture. Shareholders are urged to read the more detailed Operations section of this report which provides more information on all the exploration activity. During the year the Company completed its earn-in as a 50% participant in Western Milling LLC  a joint venture with Muletown  an established contractor in the Company's area of operations. Western Milling started the construction of a process mill to produce precious metal concentrates from pre-mined material and shallow ore with construction completed after the year-end. Production from this mill will mark the Company's first revenues and move it away from pure exploration  but commissioning of the plant and start-up of production are now dependent on final environmental consent from the State of Nevada. The project has been designedand developed meticulously in line with the regulator's own guidelines and recommendations  initially for gravity processing for which approval is being sought but at a second stage for leaching operations which will require separate approval. The State of Nevada encourages industrial development in its rural areas but due to administrative delays caused by staff shortages in the relevant state department  the Company cannot yet give any firm assurances on the timing of the permit being granted. Great Western has a lot of work ongoing relative to its small size and  although progress may sometimes seem slow with frustrating delays  in the general life cycle of mining operations a great deal has been achieved since the current management took over in late 2019. Few exploration companies of Great Western's size have created and constructed such an advanced commercial project as Western Milling LLC  in a time span of less than 18 months since first heads of terms were signed. There are multiple precious metals prospects on the Company's ground which could supply material to the process mill in the future. Most significantly  the prospect of a major  commercial copper porphyry on the Company's claims offers the sort of upside that should be highly interesting to an investor in mineral resources and provide long term value for shareholders. Looking ahead to the remainder of 2024  we expect to begin commercial production during the year even though precise timing is out of our hands. We will continue to work on the Huntoon Copper Project this summer while actively seeking a larger and better-funded industry partner to help take it to the next stage  confirming that discussions are ongoing with several interested parties. The AGM will be held in Dublin on 5 June with a telephone facility to allow shareholders to listen to the proceedings remotely. I would like to thank our investors for their patience and continuing support and our small technical team for their professionalism  dedication  hard work and positive results. Yours sincerely  Brian Hall Executive ChairmanOperations Report For the year ended 31 December 2023 Principal activities  strategy and business model The principal activity of Great Western is to explore for and develop gold  silver  copper and other minerals  with the aim of increasing shareholder value by the systematic evaluation and exploitation of its existing assets in Mineral County  Nevada  USA. Great Western's strategy is: Exploration for gold and silver on existing licensed claims to establish resources for commercial exploitation.Exploitation of previously mined material containing residual gold and silver to generate revenue.Expanding the search for precious metals into new areas.Developing copper potential based on an existing indicated and inferred resource. During the year ended 31 December 2023  Great Western held interests in seven claim groups are categorised into the following projects: Claim Group Ownership Projects Target mineral Mineral Jackpot Silver  Gold 1 Black Mountain Group 100% M2 (HCP) Copper 2 Huntoon 100% West Huntoon (HCP) Copper  Gold M4 (HCP) Copper  Gold 3 Jack Springs 100% M5 Gold  Silver  Copper 4 Rock House 100% Rock House Gold  Silver  Copper 5 Eastside Mine 100% Eastside Mine Copper 6 TUN 100% TUN Gold  Silver OMCO Mine Gold 100% Trafalgar Hill Gold 7 Olympic Gold (following exercise of West Ridge Gold op�on to purchase) Rhyolite Dome Gold As part of an annual claim renewal procedure  the Group renewed all its claims with effect from 1 September 2023 and subsequently staked 19 additional claims prior to the year-end. The land position held by Great Western in Mineral County currently consists of 760 full and fractional unpatented claims  covering an area of approximately 61 km². In addition to exploration activities  Great Western has created Western Milling LLC  a 50-50 joint venture with a local contractor  to construct a mill at Sodaville  Nevada  which will process historical mine waste into precious metal concentrates  including tailings spoil heaps and stockpiles from Great Western's claims. EXPLORATION - Precious Metals Projects Olympic Gold Project In 2020  the Company acquired an option to purchase the Olympic Gold Project  a group of 48 claims located approximately 50 miles from Great Western's other concessions and still within Mineral County. In April 2024 Great Western exercised its option to purchase Olympic Gold and made the final option payment of the total consideration of $150 000. Work is in progress on several potential prospects at this 800-acre site. The Olympic Gold Project lies on the northern flanks of the Cedar Mountain Range  on the eastern edge of Mineral County  within the Walker Lane Fault Belt at the intersection of two major mineral trends - the Rawhide- Paradise Peak trend and the Aurora-Round Mountain Trend. The mineral deposit style at Olympic is low- sulphidation epithermal banded quartz-gold vein. Production of gold from the Olympic Mine in the interwar period of 1918 to 1939 totalled approximately 35 000 tonnes at a grade of 25 grams/ton gold and 30 grams/ton silver. Based on a review of the historical data  Great Western believes that faulted offsets of the high-grade Olympic Vein remain to be discovered and this forms one of the numerous target zones on the prospect. During 2023 a single core hole was drilled as a twin of the successful 2022-hole OMRC015  to investigate the mineralised intercept in detail. This hole provided the first core at Olympic and penetrated the mineralisedhorizon  but did not improve on the previous intercept. The zone where mineralisation was expected was highly brecciated and susceptible to being lost to the core drilling fluids. The unmined portion of the OMCO vein  as intercepted in OMRC015  remains open along the edge of the workings. Considerable interpretive work has been undertaken for a better understanding of the chemostratigraphy at Olympic and to identify possible vectors towards mineralisation in the existing drill data. This resulting predictive model indicates best potential for gold southeast from the OMCO mine site  east of the major OMCO fault. Grab sampling  soil sampling and mapping were carried out at the as yet undrilled Rhyolite Dome prospect in the south of the claims group. A total of 147 new soil samples were taken in a series of northeast trending traverses  resulting in a positive anomaly for gold (45 samples >10 ppb Au  7 > 20 ppb Au and 3 > 50 ppb Au)  silver and a suite of associated elements  covering around 50 acres on the northwest side of the dome structure. The results will assist in the planning of an induced polarisation (IP) survey and drill targeting at Rhyolite Dome. Black Mountain The Black Mountain Group (""BM"") lies on a southwest trending spur ridge of the Excelsior Range of mountains and comprises 249 full and fractional claims covering 20.7km². The BM group contains both Great Western's copper resource at M2 (see Copper Projects below) and the Mineral Jackpot prospect  where outcropping veins  vein workings and spoil heaps contain high-grade gold and silver. Although the five historic mines making up Mineral Jackpot produced gold and silver around the turn of the 19th-20th century  access had only been by mule track and until 2022 none of the prospects had ever been drilled. Great Western has carried out soil surveys over the last three years  collected rock chip samples and conducted magnetometry surveys. Following a successful intercept in MJRC004  the final hole of 2022  a single follow up hole was drilled in 2023  aimed at again intersecting the near-surface mineralised zone. The zone was identified in chips at the expected position  via alteration and in anomalous assay results  but grades were subeconomic  highlighting the variability of these vein zones over relatively short distances along strike. Further planned drillholes were postponed due to technical issues with the rig. The next stage of exploration at Mineral Jackpot is being evaluated. Rock House The M7 gold-silver prospect lies within the Rock House (RH) group of claims. This area is accessible and lends itself to mining operations but has never been mined in the past  its potential having only recently been identified through the interpretation of satellite imagery. It is an approximately circular structure of around 450 acres associated with a magnetic low  and is an opening of older rock surrounded by younger volcanic cover. It is also adjacent to the prolifically mineralised Golconda thrust fault and 5 km west along strike from the historically significant Candelaria silver mining district. The area is characterised by intense argillic and sericite alteration  along with silicification and oxidation  within basement siltstones and slates. Unlike many of Great Western's other prospects  the RH targets were virgin territory until drilled by the Company in 2021. While past workings represent an important guide for exploration  a lack of any previous workings does not rule out mineralisation and any discovery made in such ground will have the benefit of being entirely intact as its highest- grade and nearest-surface portions will not have been removed by previous mining operations. Rock House was soil sampled in 2023 to test the value of higher resolution surveys around peaks in the previous reconnaissance grid in the north of the area. This work was successful  with a majority of samples matching or exceeding the previous best values obtained for gold. A follow-up broad resampling plan halved the grid spacing of soils at Rock House Northern Shear Zone. This work was underway but incomplete at the end of the year and all samples will be sent to the lab as one batch once the resampling is completed during the 2024 work season. Complex folding was observed at surface in the Southern Alteration Zone. A 3D geological model that takes the effect of folding into account is being developed. For information on the potential for copper at Rock House  see Copper Projects below. Huntoon After staking an additional 19 claims during the year  Great Western holds a total of 126 full and 12 fractional claims which surround the workings of the historic underground Huntoon gold mine and are prospective for gold  silver and copper mineralisation. The claims are located on the northwest side of the Huntoon Valley  covering approximately 10km2. The main focus for GWM at this claim group is copper  and this is covered below under Copper Projects. Huntoon does  however  contain some high-grade  potentially epithermal  preciousmetal veins  which were the target of the old Huntoon mine workings. In 2023 grabs selectively sampled for their apparent copper mineralisation  or because they contained quartz veins  yielded gold grades of 7.29 g/t  5.53 g/t and 4.51 g/t Au  and bonanza silver grades of 2 438 g/t  843 g/t  108 g/t and 102 g/t Ag. Jack Springs (""JS"") The M5 gold prospect lies within the JS Group in altered siliceous host rock surrounded by Tertiary volcaniclastics. Gold  arsenic and antimony were all anomalous in initial reconnaissance samples taken along a northeasterly crest of the central ridge at M5 during the first years of the Company's operations in the area. Since that time  due to other priorities M5 has not been further explored and remains undrilled. During2023 Great Western returned to the M5 prospect and conducted full follow up soil sampling. A total of 335 soil samples were taken in two phases  with 188 samples > 10 ppb Au  49 samples > 30 ppb  and 20 samples 50 ppb. The peak value detected in this sampling was 395 ppb or 0.395 g/t Au. A zone 1500 m long by 400 m wide was identified  which contains several corridors of anomalous gold  open as they reach the edge of surrounding overlying tertiary lavas. Two disconnected areas of sampling  taken over small 'windows' through the tertiary cover  are also broadly anomalous  suggesting a more widespread sub-cropping zone. A total of 19 new selective grab samples were taken at M5 during soil sampling. These were taken from outcrops that were mineralised in appearance or otherwise of interest to the sampling geologist. Two stand-out samples  taken from a small working which features a copper oxide bearing quartz vein  returned 5.14 g/t Au  1 246 g/t Ag (0.125 % Ag) and 0.32% Cu  and 0.291 g/t Au  534 g/t Ag  and 0.105% Cu respectively. These grabs also represents a significant increase in maximum silver results from M5  the previous most silver-rich samples being 24 g/t and 18 g/t in grab samples from the crest of the hill taken prior to 2023. A sample taken from a small pit on the southeastern flank of the M5 hill returned a grade of 1.247 g/t Au. Two other samples with notably high- grade copper (5.16 % and 1.09 % Cu) occurred on the southeast facing flank of the ridge line. These samples feature sulphide stringers with chalcopyrite and abundant copper oxides. The selected high-grade samples described above indicate that several discrete strongly mineralised structures reach the surface at M5 and are a likely source of the soil anomalies. The M4 Copper-Gold project also lies within the JS Group and is covered under Copper Projects below. Tun The M6 gold-silver prospect lies within the Tun Group. The M6 prospect is a parallel system of multiple  oxide and sulphide  gold-silver veins and veinlet stockworks. Supergene  high-grade ores have been mined in the past at M6 and the potential remains for deposits of shallow  oxidised stockworks in the immediate vicinity of the historic workings.An initial reconnaissance soil traverse was undertaken at Tun group early in the year  32 samples being taken in a single traverse  with some positive results (14 samples >10 ppb Au  2 samples >50 ppb Au). This work was an orientation survey to help identify optimal sample spacing for a more thorough future programme. EXPLORATION - Copper Projects Great Western has an exciting and extensive copper portfolio. During the year  the proximity of and possible connectivity between (1) the existing M2 resource  (2) the M4 prospect which has already been successfully drilled and (3) the West Huntoon area led to a re-categorisation of the three projects into a single area of interest  hereinafter described as the Huntoon Copper Project (HCP). The Huntoon Copper Project At M2 in the Black Mountains Group  Great Western has discovered and drilled a partly inferred  partly indicated copper resource of 4.3 million tonnes at a grade of 0.45% Cu in a skarn setting. This was a considerable achievement  with the potential to lead to the discovery of a much larger copper resource. Great Western believes that there is untested potential in both directions along strike  on a structure of up to 5 km  supported by historical mine workings to the northeast and an IP anomaly to the southwest. The M4 copper target in the JS group  approximately 4 km from the M2 resource  was identified through geophysical surveys  soil sampling and mapping of mineralised structures at surface.The Company has previously identified copper in drill intercepts at M4 (21.18 m at 0.35% Cu starting at 106.22 m in hole M2_005 including 5.64 m at 0.48% Cu and 0.105 grams/ton Au starting at 106.22 m). Great Western believes that thebreccia zone intercepted in hole M4_05  along with other such structures mapped at surface  could be offshoot structures in the roof of a buried orebody. Porphyry systems often feature breccia pipes in the upper reaches in 2019 the Group received a drill permit to follow up on the exciting discovery in hole M4_05. The abundance of highly prospective targets in the Company's portfolio  combined with rig availability issues  led to drilling on the JS projects being deferred in recent years. During 2023 the soil grid east of M4 was extended further to the east with the aim of filling a gap where the existing soil anomalies are open and surface showings of copper are present. This work was ongoing at the end of the field season  and samples will be sent to a lab in 2024  once the planned grid is complete. At West Huntoon  situated 7 km west of M4  and 10 km southwest of M2  there is a copper prospect on which the Company has previously drilled a single hole  assaying at 0.35% Cu over 27.4 metres  amongst other grading intercepts. West Huntoon also contains a sizeable copper anomaly in soils  part of which is coincident with a clear magnetic signature identified on drone magnetometry conducted in early 2022. Post mineralisation tertiary lavas obscure both the geochemical anomaly and the southwestern continuation of the linear anomaly associated with the shear zone. Significant field work at West Huntoon during 2023 included mapping  soil sampling and  towards the end of the field season  a field visit by Dr Lawrence Carter  an independent porphyry expert. A significant development occurred at the conclusion of the season's programme with the identification of several granite exposures not recorded on the US Geological Survey's official map of the area. These granites contain textures typically associated with porphyry-linked intrusions  including varying degrees of mineralisation and alteration. 135 new soil samples were taken which established a copper anomaly (>75 ppm Cu) of 2 km2 surrounding the granite outcrop  with strong outlier samples (11 samples >300 ppm  5 samples > 400 ppm  maximum value 528 ppm Cu) at several locations. In 2024 a novated Huntoon Mine Cooperation Agreement has been signed with the owner of six patented claims at the core of the West Huntoon area. This agreement provides GWM with near-term drill access  excellent road infrastructure and a local water supply located in one of the most prospective parts of the wider claim group. Other copper projects The M8 copper prospect lies within the Eastside Mine (EM) claim group  named for the historic Eastside Mine where high-gradecopper-oxide ore was mined from shallow underground workings during the First World War. Conoco investigated Eastside as a copper porphyry prospect in the early 1970s  identifying mineralisation consisting of substantial copper and molybdenum values  within a northeast trending graben structure. Drilling by Conoco at the southern end of this structure identified thick successions of alteration together with copper enrichment  but the results were not followed up. The Company regards the northerly continuation of this structure as a strong  untested target for buried copper mineralisation. During 2021 an IP survey was performedat EM Group and the results were highly encouraging. The key findings of this work were fault zones accompanied by high resistivity and chargeability features  correlating with observed surface stockwork veining  silicification  copper mineralisation and copper soil halos.Although no significant activities took place at the Eastside mine during 2023  there are drill-ready targets. Following the identification of anomalous copper in the final 2022 hole at Rock House  copper oxide has been identified in surface grabs during soil sampling in the Northern Shear Zone. While Tun has in the past been primarily a gold target  initial orientation soil samples taken there early in the year showed copper anomalism. Over 32 samples  15 were >75 ppm Cu  12 > 100 ppm Cu and 5 > 150 ppm Cu  with a peak value of 204 ppm Cu. Seeking Copper JV partner A major copper project remains too large an undertaking for a company of Great Western's size and so a larger industry partner is currently being sought  particularly in light of the potentially transformative porphyry evidence found during the year. Reclamation work Reclamation work undertaken at OMCO has been signed off by the Bureau of Land Management and a new permit issued for planned follow-up drilling and ground disturbance relating to removing mine waste for processing at the Company's milling joint venture.Summary of 2023 Work Programme Discovery of granite at the core of the West Huntoon 2 km 2 copper anomaly shows porphyry potential and new soil results strengthen continuity of the anomaly.

Samples will be submitted to lab once all planned samples have been collected. PROCESSING OPEATIONS - Joint Venture Planned Processing Operations Over the last two years  Great Western has been developing the optimum means of processing mining waste for recovery of gold and silver. Originally this was planned to be a simple gravity separation process for spoil material from Mineral Jackpot  where there are 51 known spoil heaps  but the concept was expanded once work began on the newly acquired Olympic Gold Project in 2021  where extensive tailings  spoil heaps are present and a stockpile of material had been mined but never processed. A 50-50 joint venture known as Western Milling LLC was established with local contractor Muletown Enterprizes to construct a processing mill on land owned by Muletown. Construction of the processing plant was completed in early 2024 and start-up of operations is subject only to final environmental approval from the State of Nevada. Initially material will be processed through a gravity circuit but the plant has been built to meet the specifications required for a chemical leaching project  for which a permit application will be lodged once gravity processing is operational. In 2022  an independent JORC-compliant resource estimate of Great Western's mine waste material resulted in an Inferred Resource of 31 000 tonnes  grading 1.6 grams/ton Au and 3.0 grams/ton Ag in tailings at Olympic Mine and several Exploration Targets at the OMCO Mine and Mineral Jackpot.",neutral,0.42,0.56,0.02,mixed,0.42,0.2,0.38,True,English,"['Great Western Mining', 'Final Results', 'multiple other high-grade precious metal occurrences', 'GREAT WESTERN MINING CORPORATION PLC', 'Great Western Executive Chairman Brian Hall', 'M5 Olympic Gold Project acquisition', 'high priority gold target', 'Western Milling Operating Agreement', 'Euronext Growth Listing Sponsor', 'major, commercial copper porphyry', 'two bonanza-grade silver results', 'Post Period End Highlights', 'environmental permit Granite extrusion', 'significant new copper porphyry', '1 km long trend', 'Several continuous zones', 'long term value', 'value inflection points', 'official government maps', 'abundant copper anomalism', 'Crowne Point Gold', 'Walker Lane trend', '£1.3 million new capital', 'continguous copper samples', 'production-ready pending finalisation', 'Soil sampling results', 'Huntoon Valley area', 'western part', 'great strides', 'New agreement', 'significant upgrade', 'Brian Garrahy', '£700,500 new capital', 'M5 prospect', 'soil results', 'granite outcrop', 'copper targets', 'Anomalous gold', 'Silver LLC', 'new shares', 'FINAL RESULTS', 'Financial Highlights', 'Operational Highlights', 'Initial permit', 'Joe Walker', 'soil samples', 'copper potential', 'recent samples', 'legacy samples', 'West Huntoon', '51 ppb gold', '207 ppb gold', 'development phase', 'Net assets', 'higher grade', 'Positive grab', 'Rhyolite Dome', 'Best grades', 'Induced polarisation', 'resistivity surveys', 'subsequent months', 'mineral resources', 'upcoming transition', 'important milestone', 'busy summer', 'Max Williams', 'Finance Director', 'Joint Broker', 'SP Angel', 'Ewan Leggat', 'Walbrook PR', 'PR advisers', 'Nick Rome', 'Dear Shareholder', 'audited report', 'financial statements', 'exploration activity', 'intensive fieldwork', 'tertiary cover', 'year end', 'mill site', 'report year', 'diluted loss', 'producing company', '200 hectare (490 acres', '10 ppb', '25 ppb', '61 ppb', '58 ppb', 'DECEMBER', 'AIM', 'GWMO', '8GW', 'Nevada', 'USA', 'appraisal', 'revenues', 'Basic', 'year-end', 'Cash', 'Declaration', 'Earn-In', 'placing', 'removal', 'material', 'delivery', 'cooperation', 'drill', 'expenses', 'Progress', 'sort', 'upside', 'investors', 'shareholders', 'permits', 'place', 'updates', 'developments', 'number', 'information', '8780 Davy', 'NOMAD', 'appraises', 'operations', 'tax', 'establishment']",2024-05-09,2024-05-10,marketscreener.com

The parent company  Civitanavi Systems S.p.A. (also referred to as the ""Company"")  is a company incorporated and domiciled in Italy  with its registered office in Pedaso (FM)  Via del Progresso No. 5  organised according to the laws of the Italian Republic.The majority shareholder of the Company is Civitanavi Systems Ltd  which directly holds 66.21% of the share capital  while the remaining 33.79% is in circulation on the stock market (float)  of which 5.09% is held by Athena FH Spa. The shares traded on the stock market are listed on the Euronext Milan market.The Group operates in the sector of the design  development and production of navigation and stabilisation systems in the aerospace and defence (naval  land  aeronautics  and space) and industrial (mines  oil & gas  tunnelling and horizontal drilling) divisions  as well as the provision of consultancy services to undertakings in the same divisions. More specifically  the Group is a vertically integrated supplier of highly accurate inertial systems  designed and manufactured with proprietary methods and techniques  based on FOG (Fiber Optic Gyroscope) and MEMS (Micro Electro Mechanical Systems)  possibly also integrated with other satellite navigation devices (GPS  air speed data  odometers). The inertial navigation and stabilisation systems produced by the Group  thanks to the application of the aforementioned FOG and MEMS technologies  enable (i) autonomous and high-precision inertial navigation (without a GPS)  (ii) stabilisation  (iii) precise orientation (direction with reference to the geographical north) of the mobile device on which they are applied. As part of the activities  recently also the designing and developing GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) algorithms and technologies have been introduced and the talented employee team  responsible for the new activities  has decades of experience in satellite navigation. Having the availability of a proprietary GNSS receiver allows the Company to design navigation systems on national territory that are deeply coupled with the inertial sensors already produced by the Company  in line with the trend outlined by recent scientific research. The goal is to exploit the complementarity of different technologies according to digital architectures called tight and ultra-tight and introduce new solutions on the market in the PNT domain (Position  Navigation  and Time). In this sense  the Group intends to propose new solutions able to satisfy the needs dictated by real applications  in which safety is a key factor.Thanks also to the founders'  Andrea Pizzarulli and Michael Perlmutter  many years of experience in the sector  Civitanavi fast became an important player in the global market for applications in the field of aerospace and defence and for commercial applications  being born as an innovative start-up and becoming an innovative SME in 2017.The Group carries out its activity at the registered office of Pedaso (FM) and four additional sites in Porto Sant'Elpidio (FM)  Pomezia (RM)  in Casoria (NA) and Torino (TO). The Porto Sant'Elpidio (FM) site hosts the administrative structure  the sales structure  the main research and development centre  as well as the prototyping and industrial production plants. The new site has become operating starting from the month of April 2024. At the Pomezia  Casoria and Turin sites  which are located in an area particularly dedicated to the development of activities in the aero-space field  the Group carries out design activities complementary to those performed at the main office. In addition  commercial activities focused on operators in the Rome area are carried out at the Pomezia (RM) location. Currently  in Turin  Civitanavi is working on improving countermeasures against interfering signals  which  as demonstrated by the numerous GNSS signal outages caused by jamming attacks in various GNSS- based applications encountered in recent years and in particular in Ukraine and Russian conflict scenarios  continue to present themselves as a current problem to be solved. (ref. ""When GPS fails  how can weapons find their targets? The location system is vulnerable to jamming by the enemy"" from The Economist of July the 14th 2023  www.economist.com/the-economist-explains/2023/07/14/when-gpsfails-how-can-weapons-find-their-targets). Within this context  Civitanavi Systems considers the availability of authenticated Galileo signals to be an added value to its development strategy. When suitably combined with integrated GNSS/INS platforms and miniaturised atomic clocks (Chip Scale Atomic Clocks)  they can become an extremely effective tool against spoofing attempts.The subsidiary Civitanavi Systems UK LTD located in Filton  Bristol  in the United Kingdom  is dedicated to both business and engineering activities and with the future goal of also becoming a production unit. This project is part of the objectives presented at the IPO  allocating part of the proceeds to increase production capacity (including through the opening of new sites abroad) in order to strengthen its competitiveness in the UK that is relevant to current and potential customers. It is recalled that the Group has been selected by BAE Systems as the supplier of inertial systems for the Tempest demonstration program  a sixth- generation combat aircraft. During the first quarter 2024  the subsidiary has reported operating revenues for the amount of Euro 121 thousand  following both engineering services and the activities on the contracts on orders with customers started during the last quarter 2023.On 27 March 2024  Honeywell announced the intention to acquire the entire share capital of Civitanavi Systems S.p.A.. Honeywell will initiate a voluntary tender offer to acquire all outstanding shares of Civitanavi. The transaction is not subject to any financing condition and is expected to close in the third quarter of 2024  subject to customary closing conditions  including among the others: (i) receipt of required antitrust clearance; (ii) receipt of required clearances pursuant to the foreign direct investment regulations in Italy  United Kingdom and Canada and; (iii) the tender of at least 95% of Civitanavi's outstanding4",neutral,0.02,0.98,0.01,negative,0.01,0.08,0.91,True,English,"['Interim Report Consolidated Operating Revenues', 'Civitanavi S', 'Booking', '31 March', 'Interim Report Consolidated Operating Revenues', 'Civitanavi Systems S.p.A.', 'Micro Electro Mechanical Systems', 'Chip Scale Atomic Clocks', 'numerous GNSS signal outages', 'various GNSS- based applications', 'other satellite navigation devices', 'Civitanavi Systems UK LTD', ""The Porto Sant'Elpidio"", 'Global Navigation Satellite System', 'The Civitanavi Systems Group', 'inertial stabilisation systems sector', 'miniaturised atomic clocks', 'Civitanavi Systems Ltd', 'Via del Progresso', 'Athena FH Spa', 'Fiber Optic Gyroscope', 'air speed data', 'talented employee team', 'Russian conflict scenarios', 'accurate inertial systems', 'four additional sites', 'authenticated Galileo signals', 'integrated GNSS/INS platforms', 'proprietary GNSS receiver', 'high-precision inertial navigation', 'Euronext Milan market', 'recent scientific research', 'industrial production plants', 'Pomezia (RM) location', 'navigation systems', 'location system', 'global market', 'inertial sensors', 'integrated supplier', 'proprietary methods', 'main research', 'interfering signals', 'recent years', 'The Group', 'high-tech navigation', 'real applications', 'commercial applications', 'The Economist', 'main players', 'Italian Republic', 'majority shareholder', 'share capital', 'stock market', 'horizontal drilling', 'consultancy services', 'precise orientation', 'geographical north', 'mobile device', 'national territory', 'digital architectures', 'new solutions', 'PNT domain', 'key factor', 'Andrea Pizzarulli', 'Michael Perlmutter', 'many years', 'important player', 'innovative start-up', 'innovative SME', 'administrative structure', 'sales structure', 'Turin sites', 'jamming attacks', 'current problem', 'effective tool', 'spoofing attempts', 'United Kingdom', 'future goa', 'new activities', 'different technologies', 'registered office', 'main office', 'commercial activities', 'engineering activities', 'same divisions', 'development centre', 'new site', 'aero-space field', 'Rome area', 'development strategy', 'parent company', 'MEMS technologies', 'design activities', '31 March', 'Introduction', 'Italy', 'Pedaso', 'FM', 'laws', 'circulation', 'float', 'shares', 'aerospace', 'defence', 'naval', 'land', 'aeronautics', 'mines', 'oil', 'gas', 'tunnelling', 'provision', 'undertakings', 'techniques', 'FOG', 'GPS', 'odometers', 'autonomous', 'direction', 'reference', 'part', 'algorithms', 'decades', 'experience', 'availability', 'line', 'trend', 'goal', 'complementarity', 'Position', 'Time', 'sense', 'needs', 'safety', 'founders', 'activity', 'Casoria', 'Torino', 'prototyping', 'month', 'April', 'operators', 'countermeasures', 'Ukraine', 'weapons', 'targets', 'enemy', 'July', '14th', 'explains', 'context', 'value', 'subsidiary', 'Filton', 'Bristol', 'business']",2024-05-09,2024-05-10,marketscreener.com

The domestic market shows a growth of 8.5% compared to Q1 2023. Analysis of operating profit and consolidated net profit Turning to an analysis of the Income Statement in the first quarter 2024: the Gross Margin 5Costs of Sale and Distribution   General and Administrative Costs and Other Non-Operating Costs/Revenues amounted to Euro 14.2 million in the period under review and accounted for 44.6% of revenue in the period  compared to Euro 13.2 million in the first quarter of the previous year (43.8% of revenue). Adjusted EBITDA came to Euro 1.2 million  increasing by Euro 0.7 million compared with the same period of the previous year  with an improvement in the incidence on turnover of approximately two percentage points (3.6% Q1 2024 vs 1.6% Q1 2023). It should be noted that  due to the seasonality of the business  the first quarter of the year is the one most penalised in terms of absorption of fixed costs. Net Financial Income and Expense in the first quarter of 2024 amounted to Euro -1.1 million  compared to a result of Euro -0.8 million in the first quarter of 2023; the increase of Euro 0.3 million was mainly due to exchange rate losses recorded following the depreciation of the Swiss Franc. The Adjusted Net Profit for the period was Euro -1.3 million compared to Euro -1.0 million in the first quarter of 2023  due to the above and a lower contribution of recoverable taxes  allocated exclusively to the Parent Company  whose result in the first quarter of 2024 was higher than in the corresponding period of the previous year. Analysis of consolidated net debt Net financial debt  which amounted to Euro 31.4 million as of 31 March 2024 (Euro 35.4 million as of 31 December 2023)  is mainly related to the reduction in net working capital  due to both seasonality-related effects and the actions undertaken to make it more efficient. The leverage ratio  calculated as the ratio of net financial indebtedness to adjusted EBITDA for the last 12 months  is 1.5x (compared with 1.7x at 31 December 2023). 5 The Gross Margin is the difference between sales revenue and the cost of sales. 3Significant events in Q1 2024 During the first few months of 2024  as per internal dealing and relevant shareholding disclosures pursuant to Art. 120 of Legislative Decree no. 58/98  it appears that:o the Chief Executive Officer  Christian Aleotti  purchased 500 368 ordinary shares  reaching a total shareholding of 12.15%;o the Chairman of the Board of Directors  Antonio Luigi Tazartes  purchased a total of 920 368 ordinary shares  reaching a total shareholding of 7.08%.

Current Trading The demand backdrop for our well located  energy efficient new homes remains exceptionally high across all tenure types. In our core first time buyer market  State supports for our customers  a more favourable mortgage market and the limited supply of competitively priced starter homes are driving the positive momentum in our business.The Company continues to grow our longer-term sales pipeline reflecting the increase in active large apartment projects. Our current total closed and forward orderbook now stands at over 2 750 new homes and a net sales value in excess of €1.05 billion (29 February 2024: 2 473 closed and forward sales with a net sales value of €946 million). Over 1 000 of these units will be delivered in 2025 and beyond.Our first three forward fund transactions will deliver nearly 1 300 much needed Social & Affordable new homes  with the first transaction at Parkside (368 new homes) expected to close in the short-term and the other two transactions expected to complete in H2 2024.Agreed commercial terms with a leading university for the forward funded delivery of c. 500 student beds in a scaled development adjacent to their campus. The student accommodation market is significantly undersupplied and the Government has recently launched a new initiative with long-term funding to increase the supply of affordable student housing.Received seven new grants of planning permission for c.1 500 new homes through both the Large-scale Residential Development (LRD) and Strategic Development Zones (SDZ) planning processes  further underpinning our medium-term delivery.Increased our existing €277.5 million sustainability-linked facility by €50.0 million (to €327.5 million). Home Building Finance Ireland (HBFI)  the State supported lender  will be joining our syndicate of lenders. These funds will be used to support the ongoing growth of our established scaled operating platform as we continue to expand and invest in our business and replace maturing debt facilities. Reaffirming FY24 Guidance The Company reaffirms our FY24 guidance: c. 2 200 units [1] ;[1] Operating profit of c. €145 million; andROE of 15%. The Company remains committed to distributing surplus cash to shareholders and our significant cash generation in 2024 and beyond will continue to fund consistent shareholder returns. The remaining c.€13 million in the FY23 share buyback programme is expected to complete shortly  at which point the Company will issue a further capital allocation update. Cairn will release a H1 2024 trading update in early July 2024 in advance of 2024 interim results on 4 September 2024. Commenting on the trading update  Michael Stanley  CEO  said: “We are pleased that our housing output will grow by nearly 30% this year and our forward order book of in excess of €1 billion is a testament to the exceptional demand for our homes. What is equally pleasing is that the broader industry is ramping up completions and Government initiatives are working.” For further information  contact: Cairn Homes plc +353 1 696 4600 Michael Stanley  Chief Executive Officer Richard Ball  Chief Financial Officer Stephen Kane  Director of Corporate Finance & Investor Relations Ailbhe Molloy  Investor Relations Manager Drury Communications +353 1 260 5000 Billy Murphy Claire Fox Morwenna Rice Notes to Editors Cairn Homes plc (“Cairn”) is an Irish homebuilder committed to building high-quality  competitively priced  sustainable new homes and communities in great locations.
