This is according to an announcement made by the EU yesterday that a tentative breakthrough deal has been reached re…,EU to give Ukraine weapons and aid using profits from frozen (stolen) Russian assetsThe European Union will be taking the profits that the Russian assets they froze have earned and sending them to Kiev to fund its war efforts.This is according to an announcement made by the EU yesterday that a tentative breakthrough deal has been reached regarding the handling of frozen Russian assets. Right now  there are more than $200 billion worth of Russian funds that are being held in the Belgian clearinghouse Euroclear after they were frozen shortly after the Ukraine conflict broke out in February 2022. This deal could bring Ukraine as much as $3 billion a year in profits depending on interest rates.EU ambassadors have agreed on how to spend the profits of the immobilized Russian assets  although the bloc’s member states will still need to officially endorse the agreement reached by the ambassadors. Around 90% of these profits will be used to purchase arms for Ukraine  while 10% will be devoted to non-military aid. The first round of aid from this source of funding is expected to be sent in July.However  Euroclear intends to keep 10% of the money before it sends the remainder to the EU as a buffer in case Russia launches future litigation. Belgium also reduced the fee that will be charged by Euroclear to handle the assets to just 0.3% to free up more money for Ukraine in a last-minute concession.Another concession that helped the deal go through was an offer to neutral countries such as Ireland  Austria  Cyprus and Malta to opt out from buying weapons and limit themselves solely to offering humanitarian aid to Ukraine.We are building the infrastructure of human freedom and empowering people to be informed  healthy and aware.

However  the EU has pushed back  partly out of concerns that other major international investors might lose trust in the European Union. Russia has said that seizing the money would constitute a violation of international law as well as theft  in addition to compromising trust in western currencies.In addition  Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov warned earlier this year that if frozen Russian assets are indeed seized  they will retaliate. It is estimated that the total amount of foreign direct investments in the Russian economy by the European Union  G7 nations  Switzerland and Australia amounted to $288 billion at the end of 2022.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen applauded the move  stating: “There could be no stronger symbol and no greater use for that money than to make Ukraine and all of Europe a safer place to live.”Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal and other Ukrainian officials have called on the European Union and G7 nations to go further  confiscating all of the assets and giving to them to Ukraine to use for its defense and recovery.The U.S. has recently made some moves toward directly seizing Russian assets  but it is believed that they are unlikely to do so without first getting approval from other Western nations. Nevertheless  President Biden recently signed legislation that would allow him to seize Russian foreign exchange reserves in the U.S. as part of the Rebuilding Economic Prosperity and Opportunity for Ukrainians Act. A task force has identified more than $5 billion belonging to the Russian central bank in the American banking system.Sources for this article include:RT.comPolitico.euAxios.com,neutral,0.03,0.54,0.42,mixed,0.07,0.3,0.63,True,English,"['stolen) Russian assets', 'EU', 'Ukraine', 'weapons', 'aid', 'profits', 'frozen', 'NaturalNews', 'uncensorable Brighteon.io free speech platform', 'Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal', 'President Ursula von der Leyen', 'Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov', 'free, downloadable generative AI tools', 'other major international investors', 'Russian foreign exchange reserves', 'other Ukrainian officials', 'foreign direct investments', 'Rebuilding Economic Prosperity', 'American banking system', 'Russian central bank', 'other Western nations', 'stolen) Russian assets', 'The U.S.', 'tentative breakthrough deal', 'Belgian clearinghouse Euroclear', 'Brighteon.AI', 'The European Union', 'frozen Russian assets', 'President Biden', 'international law', 'Russian funds', 'Russian economy', 'western currencies', 'G7 nations', 'European Commission', '$200 billion worth', 'interest rates', 'member states', 'future litigation', 'neutral countries', 'human freedom', 'HealthRangerStore.com', 'hot debate', 'total amount', 'stronger symbol', 'greater use', 'safer place', 'Ukrainians Act', 'task force', 'war efforts', 'military aid', 'first round', 'last-minute concession', 'humanitarian aid', 'Politico.eu', 'Ukraine conflict', 'EU ambassadors', 'weapons', 'profits', 'Kiev', 'announcement', 'handling', 'February', 'bloc', 'agreement', 'arms', 'source', 'funding', 'July', 'money', 'remainder', 'buffer', 'case', 'Belgium', 'fee', 'offer', 'Ireland', 'Austria', 'Cyprus', 'Malta', 'infrastructure', 'people', 'purchase', 'humanity', 'knowledge', 'abundance', 'calls', 'subject', 'concerns', 'trust', 'violation', 'theft', 'addition', 'Switzerland', 'Australia', 'end', 'move', 'defense', 'recovery', 'approval', 'legislation', 'part', 'Opportunity', 'article', 'Axios']",2024-05-10,2024-05-11,naturalnews.com

There could be no stronger symbol and no greater use for that money than to make Ukraine and all of Europe a safer place to live "" she said on X.If the move is approved at a gathering of EU finance ministers next Tuesday  the interest - worth up to three billion euros per year - will be used to jointly purchase military hardware for Ukraine.Citing four unnamed EU diplomats  Reuters said that EU ministers still need to approve the legal text that will see 90 percent of the proceeds go into an EU-run fund for military aid for Ukraine  with the other 10 percent would be purportedly used for reconstruction.The Kremlin has previously said that seizing the interest arising from frozen Russian assets was a move toward the ""destruction of the legal foundations of European law and international law.""Around 70 percent of Russian assets frozen in Western countries are held in Euroclear  a Belgian-based securities depository  which has the equivalent of approximately $204 billion worth of Russian central bank securities and cash.Since the onset of the current war  Euroclear has made about â‚¬5 billion in net profits from the Russian assets  of which  net profits produced until mid-February this year will stay with the depository and act as a buffer against legal claims.Back in late April  Moscow threatened the West with a ""severe"" response and ""endless"" legal challenges if the assets are touched.NEWS LETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address",neutral,0.24,0.47,0.29,mixed,0.11,0.27,0.62,True,English,"['frozen Russian assets', 'EU', 'profits', 'Ukraine', 'EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen', 'GlobalSecurity.org mailing list', 'four unnamed EU diplomats', 'Russian central bank securities', 'Russian central bank assets', 'frozen Russian state assets', 'Iran Press TV', 'possible global clash', 'frozen Russian assets', 'EU finance ministers', 'Belgian-based securities depository', 'endless"" legal challenges', 'The European Union', 'EU ministers', 'EU countries', 'EU ambassadors', 'Russian aggression', 'immobilized assets', 'European law', 'legal text', 'legal foundations', 'legal claims', 'military hardware', 'ex-Soviet republic', 'member states', 'extraordinary revenues', 'Belgian presidency', 'military defense', 'first tranche', 'stronger symbol', 'greater use', 'safer place', 'three billion', 'EU-run fund', 'military aid', 'The Kremlin', 'international law', 'Western countries', '$204 billion worth', 'late April', 'severe"" response', 'NEWS LETTER', 'Email Address', 'European bloc', 'windfall profits', 'net profits', 'political agreement', 'current war', 'other 10 percent', '90 percent', '70 percent', 'Ukraine', 'Thursday', 'May', 'order', 'flow', 'arms', 'Envoys', 'principle', 'February', 'part', 'sanctions', 'Moscow', 'measures', 'post', 'funds', 'recovery', 'context', 'July', 'proposal', 'proceeds', 'money', 'X.', 'move', 'gathering', 'interest', 'year', 'Reuters', 'reconstruction', 'destruction', 'Euroclear', 'equivalent', 'cash', 'onset', 'buffer']",2024-05-10,2024-05-11,globalsecurity.org

The bloc said the first payments could be made by the summer  despite calls by Washington for its European allies to go much further and fully seize Russia's billions for the benefit of Kyiv.EU officials welcomed the agreement. Writing on X  formerly Twitter  EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Thursday  ""there could be no stronger symbol and no greater use for that money than to make Ukraine and all of Europe a safer place to live.""The EU's Trade Commissioner  Valdis Dombrovskis  wrote that the first $1 billon should be available by the summer  mainly for military support. ""Russia will pay directly for its crimes "" Dombrovskis said.Assets frozenWestern financial institutions and companies are holding billions of dollars of cash and assets of Russia's central bank  which were frozen by Europe and the United States in the wake of Moscow's February 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. About 70% of the assets  amounting to more than $200 billion  are held in Brussels at Euroclear  a financial services company and clearing house that specializes in cross-border securities transactions and the safe-keeping of assets.The United States  along with Britain and Canada  have been pushing for those assets to be fully seized and used to help Kyiv fight Russia's invasion. Last month  Washington passed legislation allowing it to seize Russian foreign currency reserves within the United States to fund weapons for Ukraine.European cautionHowever  Europe is being more cautious. European Union ambassadors meeting in Brussels Wednesday agreed in principle to use only the interest earned on the Russian assets.Ian Bond  a foreign policy analyst and Russia specialist at the Center for European Reform  said Brussels could go further.""What the EU is talking about is not seizing the principal - but using the interest  which might amount to seven or $8 billion a year and using that for the benefit of Ukraine "" Bond told VOA. ""It's a worthwhile sum of money  but it is a tiny sum of money compared to the amount of damage that Russia has done to Ukraine and the amount of money that Ukraine needs to keep its government services and its war effort going.""The deal should be fully signed off at an EU finance ministers' meeting on May 14.German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said the bloc must act quickly to support Ukraine.""The funds available there can be used not only for procurement (of weapons) within Europe  but also outside Europe. Because what really matters now is that weapons can be delivered as quickly as possible "" Scholz said Monday during a visit to Latvia.EU fearsSome in Europe fear that the U.S. plan to fully seize Russia's assets would trigger a lengthy legal battle and may prompt other countries like China to sell their euro investments  destabilizing the currency.Neutral EU states  including Hungary and Austria  objected to using the profits to buy Ukraine weapons. The EU has secured their agreement by ringfencing around 10 per cent of the Russian windfall profits for humanitarian aid.Russian retaliationRussia last month warned the West against seizing its assets. ""Russian assets must remain untouched because otherwise there will be a severe response to Western thievery "" Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova wrote on Telegram April 28.There are concerns in Europe that Moscow will retaliate by seizing more assets belonging to Western companies still operating in Russia.Those companies may find little sympathy in the West  suggests analyst Ian Bond.""My view on that is these companies have had two years to get out of the Russian market. If they stayed in  it was because they thought it was okay to continue to earn money in Russia  despite the fact that it was waging a brutal war of aggression against one of its neighbors. And if they lose their shirts now  that's their tough luck "" he said.""There are European assets in Russia that the Russian government could seize. And it has in some cases already seized the assets of Western private companies in Russia. But I don't think that the amounts would match up "" Bond added.EU officials hope the deal will be fully implemented by June  when Hungary is due to take over the rotating EU Council presidency. Analysts say there are concerns within the EU that Hungary's Prime Minister Viktor Orban could try to block the deal if it isn't fully signed off by then  as he seeks to maintain close ties with Russia.NEWS LETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address",neutral,0.08,0.57,0.35,mixed,0.1,0.31,0.58,True,English,"['frozen Russian assets', 'Ukraine weapons', 'Europe', 'profits', 'EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen', 'Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova', 'Prime Minister Viktor Orban', 'GlobalSecurity.org mailing list', ""EU finance ministers' meeting"", 'rotating EU Council presidency', 'German Chancellor Olaf Scholz', 'Russian foreign currency reserves', 'foreign policy analyst', 'cross-border securities transactions', 'U.S. plan', 'lengthy legal battle', 'Western financial institutions', 'financial services company', 'European Union ambassadors', 'Neutral EU states', 'February 2022 full-scale invasion', 'The European Union', 'Russian windfall profits', 'The United States', 'analyst Ian Bond', 'frozen Russian assets', 'Western private companies', 'Russian retaliation', 'Russian market', 'Russian government', 'EU officials', 'EU fears', 'government services', 'Western thievery', 'European allies', 'European caution', 'European Reform', 'Western companies', 'Henry Ridgwell', 'first payments', 'stronger symbol', 'greater use', 'safer place', 'Trade Commissioner', 'first $1 billon', 'military support', 'central bank', 'clearing house', 'worthwhile sum', 'tiny sum', 'war effort', 'other countries', 'euro investments', '10 per cent', 'humanitarian aid', 'severe response', 'little sympathy', 'two years', 'brutal war', 'tough luck', 'close ties', 'NEWS LETTER', 'Email Address', 'European assets', 'Valdis Dombrovskis', 'Russia specialist', 'Ukraine weapons', 'principle', 'deal', 'proceeds', 'bloc', 'summer', 'calls', 'Washington', 'billions', 'benefit', 'Kyiv', 'agreement', 'Twitter', 'money', 'crimes', 'dollars', 'cash', 'wake', 'Moscow', 'Brussels', 'Euroclear', 'safe-keeping', 'Britain', 'Canada', 'legislation', 'interest', 'Center', 'principal', 'VOA.', 'amount', 'damage', 'May', 'funds', 'procurement', 'visit', 'Latvia', 'China', 'Hungary', 'Austria', 'Telegram', 'concerns', 'view', 'fact', 'aggression', 'neighbors', 'shirts', 'cases', 'June', 'Analysts']",2024-05-10,2024-05-11,globalsecurity.org

Should the annual general meeting not resolve to increase the maximum number of board members as set out in the articles of association  the nomination committee proposes re-election of Elizabeth Para  Franca Ruhwedel  Johan Roslund and Remco Westermann  and the election of Greg Coleman as new board member  as well as re-election of Tobias M. Weitzel as member and chairman of the board of directors for the period until the close of the annual general meeting 2025 (item 11).Re-election of the company's auditor Deloitte Sweden AB for the period until the close of the annual general meeting 2025. Deloitte Sweden AB has informed the nomination committee that the auditor Christian Lundin will continue as auditor-in-charge if Deloitte Sweden AB is re-elected as auditor (item 11). The nomination committee's complete proposals  including a presentation of the proposed members of the board of directors and an assessment of their independence in relation to the company  the executive management and the company's major shareholders  are available on the company's website (www.mgi-se.com). Item 12(a)-(b). Resolutions on (a) change of the company name by amendment of paragraph 1 of the articles of association and (b) amendment of paragraph 3 of the articles of association The board of directors proposes a change of the company name by amendment of paragraph 1 of the articles of association and  in connection with this  an amendment of paragraph 3 of the articles of association. The changes are proposed in order to mark the completion of the company's transformation into a leading digital media company. The proposals under item 12 of the agenda consist of (a) change of the company name by amendment of paragraph 1 of the articles of association and (b) an amendment of the articles of association and are conditional on each other; thus the board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting's resolutions under item 12 shall be adopted as a single and joint resolution. The resolutions under item 12 are valid only if supported by shareholders holding at least two-thirds of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the annual general meeting. (a) Resolution on change of the company name by amendment of paragraph 1 of the articles of association The board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to change the name of the company to Verve Group SE. The proposal to change the name of the company marks the completion of the company's transformation into a leading digital media company. Over the past years  MGI has strategically shifted its focus towards becoming an integrated digital media company  operating a fast-growing  profitable ad-software platform that matches global advertiser demand with publisher ad-supply while having a strong competitive advantage based on data and AI. The rebranding is a logical next step within this transformation. Based on the advertising part already working with the brand Verve Group  it makes sense to now introduce the Verve brand for the entire company  emphasising today's as well as future focus of the company. The gaming subsidiaries of MGI which support the media business strongly with unique ad-inventory  data and testing environments  will continue to operate under their own brands. The change requires paragraph 1 of the articles of association to be amended accordingly. The board of directors  the CEO or such person as the board of directors authorise  shall be authorised to make such minor amendments and clarifications of the annual general meeting's decision that is required in connection with the registration of this resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office. (b) Resolution on amendment of paragraph 3 of the articles of association In order to align the articles of association with the company's transformation into a leading digital media company and the name change proposed under item 12(a) above  the board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to replace paragraph 3 of the articles of association  objects of the company  as follows: Current wording: The company shall directly or through subsidiaries conduct operations that include (a) distribution of and trade with computer-  console- and video- and mobile games  as distributor  licensee and developer to consumers and business partners and provide online platforms for such games  (b) media activities for advertisers as well as publishers and other connected platforms and partners  to sell and buy ads and to provide the technical platforms and processes as well as data for that  (c) manage and acquire tangible and intangible assets (including majority as well as minority participations) and conduct operations compatible therewith  and (d) any other activities including financing of the herefore mentioned activities. New wording: The company shall conduct operations that include (a)  directly or indirectly through subsidiaries  media activities for advertisers as well as publishers and other connected platforms and partners  to sell and buy ads and to provide the technical platforms and processes as well as data for that  as well as conduct operations compatible therewith and (b)  indirectly through subsidiaries  distribution of and trade with computer-  console- and video- and mobile games  as distributor  licensee and developer to consumers and business partners and provide online platforms for such games. The board of directors  the CEO or such person as the board of directors authorise  shall be authorised to make such minor amendments and clarifications of the annual general meeting's decision that is required in connection with the registration of this resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office. Item 13(a)-(c). Resolutions on (a) the establishment of LTIP 2024  (b) delivery of Shares under the LTIP 2024 through an issue and transfer of warrants of series 2024/2036 and (c) delivery of Shares under the LTIP 2024 through hedging arrangements with a third party (a) Resolution on the establishment of LTIP 2024 Background and purpose The board of directors proposes that the general meeting resolves to establish a new long-term incentive program (""LTIP 2024""). The MGI group is international  with the majority of its revenue and a substantial part of its operations in North America  and thus competes for talent globally. In order to attract and retain talent for key positions it is important that MGI can offer its key employees a competitive remuneration package. This includes being able to offer similar types of compensation as its global competitors  an important component of which is a competitive LTIP program. The proposed LTIP 2024 is similar to the company'sexisting and historical incentive programs that are approaching the end of their duration and is designed to retain and motivate the group's senior key employees. The program is intended to span three years (36 months) from 30 June 2024  with an allocation to participantsspread over the duration of the 36 months program. The purpose of proposing a multiyear program is to give the shareholders greater visibility over potential dilution and to give better foreseeability for participantsas well as to provide flexibility for the company to adapt allocation during the span of the program to cater for inter alia such years when there are more new hires that the company deems shall be encompassed by the program. Approximately 50 key employees  including the top management of the company and certain subsidiaries  will be entitled to participate in the LTIP 2024. The purpose of the LTIP 2024 is to give the participantsan opportunity to take part in a potential increase in the value of the MGI shares  thereby ensuring that the participants' interests are aligned with shareholder interests. Subject to the terms and conditions of the LTIP 2024  the companywill award restricted stock options (""RSOs"") to members of the MGI group's top management  including the CEO  and to other key employees (the ""Participants""). Main terms The RSOs shall be allocated by the board of directors  pursuant to the following main principles (which will be reflected in agreements with each Participant): The maximum number of RSOs that may be granted per each consecutive twelve-month period is 2 300 000 and the maximum number of RSOs that may be granted under the LTIP 2024 is 4 750 000  which can be used to acquire a maximum of 4 750 000 of the company's shares of Class A ("" Shares ""). The aforementioned three consecutive twelve-month periods shall be: 30 June 2024-29 June 2025  30 June 2025-29 June 2026 and 30 June 2026-30 June 2027. The maximum number of RSOs that may be granted is equivalent to a maximum potential average dilution of less than 1.0% per twelve-month period provided an equal part of the maximum number of RSOs are granted each such period and less than 3.0% over the entire duration of the LTIP 2024. If the maximum number of RSOs that may be allocated during one twelve-month period has not been allocated to Participants such period the remainder may be granted in subsequent periods. The RSOs can be exercised to acquire Shares at a strike price equivalent to the higher of EUR 2.00 and 120% of the Share price in connection with the Date of Grant  as further described under ""Price and other terms"" below. The RSOs will be granted to up to 50 Participants. The maximum number of RSOs that can be awarded to any Participant  including the CEO  in one year is 500 000. A Participant may only be granted RSOs once each consecutive twelve-month period during the duration of LTIP 2024. RSOs may be granted to Participants  as of the last business day of the first three quarters each consecutive twelve-month period during the duration of LTIP 2024 (provided for the avoidance of doubt that no RSOs may be granted for the first quarter of 2024). A date on which RSOs are granted is referred to as a "" Date of Grant "". All granted RSOs are subject to being earned and vesting prior to being exercised  each as further described below. If applicable insider rules and regulations prohibit a Participant from being granted RSOs at any of the dates set out above  or in other extraordinary circumstances  the board of directors has the right to postpone the Date of Grant for a Participant. The Participants will earn RSOs each of the first four yearly anniversaries following the applicable Date of Grant (each an "" Earn Event "" where granted RSOs are "" Earned ""). The Participants will Earn 15% at the first Earn Event  25% at the second Earn Event  25% at the third Earn Event and the remaining 35% at the fourth Earn Event until all RSOs granted at a Date of Grant have been Earned after four years from such Date of Grant. The period from a Date of Grant until the fourth Earn Event is referred to as the "" Earn Period "". The RSOs will vest on the date falling two years after each respective Earn Event (meaning that the first 15% of the RSOs will vest three years from each Participant's Date of Grant). If a Participant leaves the MGI group earlier than two years after such Participant's first Date of Grant  all of the Participant's RSOs are lost. However  if a Participant leaves the MGI group more than two years after such Participant's first Date of Grant  such Participant shall be entitled to keep all of his or hers vested RSOs as well as 50% of his or hers Earned but unvested RSOs  and the Participant will not be subject to any additional Earn Events. Any RSOs not exercised at the latest 30 months after a Participant has left the MGI group shall lapse without any compensation to the Participant. The board of directors shall be responsible for the detailed terms and the administration of the LTIP 2024 within the scope and framework of this proposal. Price and other terms Each vested RSO entitles the Participant to acquire one Share at a price equivalent to the higher of (i) EUR 2.00 and (ii) 120% of the average closing price of the Share on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (Xetra) during the period of twenty (20) trading days immediately prior to each relevant Date of Grant (the ""Strike Price""). Participants can exercise vested RSOs as of the last business day of the first three quarters each year (each an ""Exercise Date"")  starting on the date falling two years from the relevant Earn Event (i.e.  on the vesting date) and ending on the date falling three years thereafter (i.e.  five years after the relevant Earn Event). If applicable insider rules and regulations prohibit a Participant from exercising its RSOs at any of the applicable Exercise Dates  the board of directors has the right to postpone the Exercise Date for such Participant. The agreements with the Participants shall include provisions regulating the event of a change in control of the company(meaning a party  or several parties acting in concert  acquiring shares representing more than 90 percent of the votes in the company) or a direct or indirect sale  transfer or other disposal of all or substantially all of the business and assets  in which case any Earned RSOs  plus those that pro rata in relation to the actual time lapsed since the previous Earn Event  would be Earned during that year  and any vested but not already exercised  RSOs shall become exercisable. The maximum number of Shares the RSOs entitle to subscription for and the Strike Price shall be recalculated based on  and in the event of such circumstances set out in  the terms and conditions of the warrants under the Warrant Hedge Arrangement proposed below. The LTIP 2024 will be governed by Swedish law  unless to the extent mandatory applicable law applicable to a Participant requires otherwise. Performance criteria The initial allocation of RSOs to Participants under the LTIP 2024 shall be determined based on the Participants' level of responsibility as well as individual performance. The performance metrics include both financial criteria such as revenue growth and cost control and responsibility and non-financial criteria  such as e.g. onboarding new customers  meeting product or engineering goals. Further  the value of the RSOs is linked to the economic value added by the Participants and as such the equity value of the company. Participants only get the value add  based on the Share price development; i.e. the value of the Share at the Exercise Date minus the Strike Price. Consequently  in order for the RSOs to have any value  MGI'sShare price needs to increase by more than 20% compared to the Share price during the measurement period (as described above). The board of directors thus considers the Participant's incentives to be aligned with MGI'sshareholders without additional performance criteria for the exercise of the RSOs. Delivery of Shares and hedging The board of directors has considered two alternatives for delivering Shares to Participants in the LTIP 2024. Firstly  the board of directors recommends  in accordance with the proposal under item 13(b) on the proposed agenda  that the company issues warrants to a subsidiary or to the company and that the subsidiary or the company may dispose of the warrants in order to ensure the company'sobligations under the LTIP 2024 (the ""Warrant Hedge Arrangement""). However  if the annual general meeting does not resolve on the Warrant Hedge Arrangement  the board of directors has also considered another alternative  a so called swap agreement as proposed under item 13(c) on the proposed agenda. This alternative entails higher costs for MGI  and is therefore only intended to be exercised if the Warrant Hedge Arrangement is not approved by the annual general meeting. In the event a Participant cannot receive Shares under applicable laws or regulations or at reasonable cost or with reasonable administrative effort by the Participant or the company or if otherwise deemed suitable by the board of directors  the board of directors shall have the right to decide to settle the RSOs: (i) wholly or partly in cash (including for the purpose of allowing the Participants to fund the subscription price for Shares through exercise of warrants)  (ii) through the delivery of part of the Shares or warrants against a lower Strike Price  (iii) through a ""net settlement"" whereby a number of warrants are allocated to a Participant for free corresponding to the net value of the Participant's RSOs  or (iv) through a combination thereof. The board of directors shall also have the right to  in its own discretion  decide that Shares  warrants and/or cash shall be withheld by the company in order to cover or facilitate the payment of applicable taxes. Only whole warrants (no fractions) may be delivered to a Participant to settle the company'sobligation under LTIP 2024 and the number of warrants delivered to a Participant in the settlement shall thus be rounded down to the nearest number of whole warrants. Dilution effect The maximum dilution effect will be approximately 3.0 percent if all RSOs are settled in Shares and consequently maximally 4 750 000 warrants of series 2024/2036 are exercised for subscription of up to 4 750 000 new Shares in the company. In the event of a full or partial cash or net settlement  the dilution would be substantially lower than the number of RSOs distributed. If the warrant settlement method proposed under item 13(b)of the proposed agenda is not approved with the requisite majority and the company'sobligations under the LTIP 2024 are settled by way of an equity swap arrangement with a third party proposed under item 13(c)  no dilution effect will arise. Costs The costs for the LTIP 2024 are based on the IFRS 2 reporting standards and will be amortised over the Earn Period. The board of directors has made a preliminary cost calculation for the LTIP 2024  which is based on a share price at the Date of Grant of EUR 1.66  a Strike Price of EUR 2  that all granted RSOs are Earned following the Earn Period and a time period from the granting of the RSOs to exercise of 6.47 years. On the basis of the above assumptions  the value of each RSO has  using a Black & Scholes simulation model been set at EUR 0.85 which implies expected costs for the LTIP 2024 of approximately EUR 4.00 million. No other material costs  including social security costs  are expected in relation to the LTIP 2024. Other share-based incentive programs in MGI For information about other share-based incentive programs in MGI  please refer to the company'sannual report 2024 (see section ""Equity-settled share-based payment transactions""). These main terms are also available on the company's website (www.mgi-se.com). Other than as described therein there are no other share-based incentive schemes in MGI. Preparation of the proposal The LTIP 2024 has been prepared by the company'sremuneration committee and has been adopted by the board of directors. Authorisation Each of the members of board of directors  or such person as the board of directors authorise  shall be authorised to make such minor adjustments to this resolution that may be required for the registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office  Euroclear Sweden AB or any other CSD than Euroclear Sweden AB. The board of directors shall have the right to undertake minor adjustments to the LTIP 2024 due to applicable foreign rules and laws  applicable law  regulation  market practice or otherwise. Majority requirement and conditions for the resolution A resolution in accordance with the board of directors' proposal regarding the establishment of the LTIP 2024 under this item 13(a) of the proposed agenda requires support from shareholders representing more than half of the votes cast at the general meeting. The resolution shall be conditional upon that the general meeting resolves upon either of the board of director's proposals to secure the delivery of Shares under the LTIP 2024 under items 13(b) or 13(c) on the proposed agenda. (b) Resolution on delivery of Shares under the LTIP 2024 through an issue and transfer of warrants of series 2024/2036 Under the LTIP 2024 proposed by the board of directors under item 13(a) of the proposed agenda  the company has an obligation  subject to certain conditions  to deliver Shares to the Participants in the LTIP 2024. In order to secure the company'sobligation to deliver Shares and  to the extent permitted and possible  cover any costs (including taxes and social security charges)  the board of directors proposes that the general meeting resolves to issue and transfer up to 4 750 000 warrants of series 2024/2036 on the terms and conditions set out below. The board of directors considers the warrant settlement method to be the preferred alternative to the equity swap arrangement with a third party included in item 13(c) of the proposed agenda since the costs for an equity swap arrangement are significantly higher than the costs for issuing and transferring warrants.If the general meeting resolves to approve the proposed warrant settlement method under this item 13(b) with the requisite majority  the resolution under item 13(c)below will not be required. In order to secure the company'sobligation to deliver Shares under the LTIP 2024  the board of directors proposes that the general meeting resolves to issue and transfer warrants of series 2024/2036 in the company on the following terms and conditions: A maximum of 4 750 000 warrants of series 2024/2036 shall be issued. The right to subscribe for the warrants shall  with deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights vest with the company or a subsidiary to the company with the right and obligation to dispose of the warrants in accordance with the company's obligations under the LTIP 2024. The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights is to secure the company's obligations to deliver Shares and to cover any costs (including taxes and social security charges) under the LTIP 2024. Subscription for the warrants shall take place on a separate subscription list not later than on 27 June 2024. The warrants shall be issued without consideration. Each warrant shall entitle the holder to subscribe for one new Share (a share in the company of Class A). The exercise price for subscription for Shares based on the warrants shall correspond to the  at the time of exercise  quota value of a share in the company. The warrants may be exercised during the period from and including 30 June 2025 up to and including 31 December 2036. The new Shares shall carry rights to dividends for the first time on the record date for dividends that occurs after subscription has been effected. The number of Shares for which each warrant entitles subscription may be recalculated under certain circumstances as set forth in the complete terms and conditions for the warrants. Upon exercise of all 4 750 000 warrants  the company's share capital will increase by EUR 47 500 (based on a quota value of EUR 0.01 and with EUR 4 750 000 based on a quota value of EUR 1). The new Shares will be encompassed by the conversion clause in the company's articles of association. The company and the subsidiary as applicable may for the purpose of delivering Shares and secure its obligations under the LTIP 2024: transfer the warrants to Participants in LTIP 2024 without consideration whereby subscription of Shares is to be made through the exercise of the warrants and against payment of the quota value transfer the warrants to a third party with whom the company has entered into an agreement regarding exercising the warrants and delivery of Shares to Participants in LTIP 2024 in accordance with the terms and conditions for LTIP 2024  and/orotherwise disposes of the warrants in order to ensure the company's obligations in connection with LTIP 2024. The complete terms and conditions for the warrants of series 2024/2036  a copy of the company's articles of association  other information and documents according to the Swedish companies act will be available at the company and on the company'swebsite (www.mgi-se.com) not later than three weeks prior to the general meeting. A resolution in accordance with the board of directors' proposal requires support from shareholders representing not less than nine-tenths of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the general meeting. (c) Resolution on delivery of Shares under the LTIP 2024 through hedging arrangements with a third party As set out under items 13(a) and 13(b) above  the board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves that MGI  if the required majority for approval is not reached under item 13(b) above  may enter into agreements on hedging arrangements with a third party in order to ensure the company'sobligation to deliver Shares in accordance with LTIP 2024. Such arrangement would mean that MGI enters into an equity swap agreement with a third party for such third party to acquire Shares in its own name and thereafter transfers the Shares (or the corresponding value of a cash settlement  if applicable) to Participants in LTIP 2024. The resolution is conditional upon that the required majority for approval of item 13(b) above is not reached. Item 14. Resolution on an authorisation for the board of directors to resolve on issuance of shares  warrants and convertibles The board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to authorise the board of directors to  at one or several occasions and for the time period until the next annual general meeting  issue shares  warrants and convertibles within the limits of the company's articles of association. The authorisation shall be limited so that the board of directors may not resolve upon issues of shares  warrants and convertibles that entail that the total number of shares that are issued  issued through conversion of convertibles or issued through exercise of warrants exceeds 35% of the total number of shares in the company at the time the board of directors exercises the authorisation for the first time. Issues of shares  warrants and convertibles may be made with or without deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights and with or without provisions for payment in kind  set-off or other conditions. The purpose of the authorisation and the possibility to deviate from the shareholders' preferential rights shall be to finance acquisitions  raise capital to facilitate growth and development of the company or to hedge  facilitate or settle the company's incentive programs. The board of directors  the CEO or such person as the board of directors authorise  shall be authorised to make such minor amendments and clarifications of the annual general meeting's decision that is required in connection with the registration of this resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office. A resolution in accordance with this item 14 is only valid where supported by shareholders holding not less than two-thirds of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the annual general meeting. Items 15(a)-(b). Resolutions on (a) amendment of paragraph 4 of the articles of association and (b) reduction of the share capital The board of directors proposes an adjustment of the company's quota value from EUR 1 per share to EUR 0.01 per share. The adjustment is proposed in order to have a quota value which is more typical for Swedish companies and thus facilitate corporate actions in accordance with Swedish market practice  e.g.  possible future quota value issues  rights issues where a market standard discount is applied  share issues or efficient settlement of incentive programs and share based acquisitions. If the annual general meeting resolves on the amendment of paragraph 4 of the articles of association and the reduction of the share capital according to this item 15 on the proposed agenda  the board of directors intends to amend the terms of the outstanding warrants in the company to align inter alia the strike price with the new quota value. The proposals under item 15 of the agenda consist of (a) an amendment of paragraph 4 of the articles of association and (b) a reduction of the share capital and are conditional on each other; thus the board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting's resolutions under item 15 shall be adopted as a single and joint resolution. The resolutions under item 15 are valid only if supported by shareholders holding at least two-thirds of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the annual general meeting. (a) Resolution on amendment of paragraph 4 of the articles of association In order to enable the reduction of the share capital proposed under item 15(b) below  the board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves that the limitations with respect to the share capital in paragraph 4 of the company's articles of association  are amended so that the minimum share capital is EUR 1 550 000 and the maximum share capital is EUR 6 200 000. The board of directors  the CEO or such person as the board of directors authorise  shall be authorised to make such minor amendments and clarifications of the annual general meeting's decision that is required in connection with the registration of this resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office  Euroclear Sweden AB or any other CSD than Euroclear Sweden AB  or due to other formal requirements. (b) Resolution on a reduction of the share capital The board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves on a reduction of the share capital on the following terms and conditions. The share capital is to be reduced by EUR 157 656 864.42. The reduction of the share capital is to be effected without redemption of shares. The purpose of the reduction is allocation to unrestricted shareholders' equity in order to reduce the company's quota value. Following the reduction  the share capital will amount to EUR1 592 493.58 divided among 159 249 358 class A shares and 0 class B shares (i.e. 159 249 358 shares in total)  each with a quota value of EUR 0.01. The reduction of the share capital is subject to amendment of the articles of association pursuant to item 15(a) above. The company may not execute the reduction without approval from the Swedish Companies Registration Office or a public court  since the measures taken together result in a decrease in the company's restricted share capital. The board of directors  the CEO or such person as the board of directors authorise  shall be authorised to make such minor amendments and clarifications of the annual general meeting's decision that is required in connection with the registration of this resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office  Euroclear Sweden AB or any other CSD than Euroclear Sweden AB  or due to other formal requirements. SHAREHOLDERS' RIGHT TO REQUEST INFORMATION The board of directors and the CEO shall  if any shareholder so requests and the board of directors believes that it can be done without significant harm to the company  provide information in respect of any circumstances which may affect the assessment of a matter on the agenda and any circumstances that may affect the assessment of the company's financial position. The duty to provide information shall also apply to the company's relationship with another group company  the consolidated accounts and such circumstances regarding subsidiaries that are referred to in the preceding sentence.

(the ""Issuer"" or the ""Company"")  subject to compliance with all relevant laws  regulations and directives  may from time to time issue Euro Medium Term Notes (the ""Notes""). The aggregate nominal amount of Notes outstanding under the Programme will not at any time exceed Euro 6 000 000 000 (or the equivalent in other currencies)  subject to increase as provided herein. Notice of the aggregate nominal amount of Notes  interest payable in respect of Notes and the issue price of Notes will be set out in the Final Terms  which will also complete information set out in the terms and conditions (the ""Terms and Conditions of the Notes"" or the ""Conditions"") applicable to each Tranche  as required. Application has been made to the Luxembourg Stock Exchange for the Notes issued under the Programme for the period of 12 months from the date of this base prospectus (the ""Base Prospectus"") to be admitted to the official list of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (the ""Official List"") and to be admitted to trading on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange's regulated market. References in this Base Prospectus to Notes being ""listed"" (and all related references) shall mean that such Notes have been admitted to the Official List and admitted to trading on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange's regulated market. The Luxembourg Stock Exchange's regulated market is a regulated market for the purposes of Directive 2014/65/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council on markets in financial instruments  as amended (""MiFID II""). The Programme provides for Notes to be listed on such other or further stock exchange(s) as may be agreed between the Issuer and the relevant Dealer(s). The relevant Final Terms in respect of the issue of any Notes will specify whether or not such Notes will be listed on the Official List and admitted to trading on the Luxembourg Stock Exchange's regulated market (or any other stock exchange). Copies of the Final Terms in relation to the Notes to be listed on the Official List will also be published on the website of the Luxembourg Stock Exchange (www.luxse.com.). This Base Prospectus has been approved by the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (the ""CSSF"")  as competent authority under Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 (the ""Prospectus Regulation""). The CSSF only approves this Base Prospectus as meeting the standards of completeness  comprehensibility and consistency imposed by the Prospectus Regulation. Such approval should not be considered as an endorsement of either the Issuer or the quality of the Notes that are the subject of this Base Prospectus and investors should make their own assessment as to the suitability of investing in the Notes. The CSSF assumes no responsibility as to the economic and financial soundness of the issue of any Notes or the quality or solvency of the Issuer in line with the provisions of article 6(4) of the Luxembourg Act dated 16 July 2019 relating to prospectuses for securities. Each Series (as defined in ""General Description of the Programme - Method of Issue"") of Notes will be represented on issue by a temporary global note in bearer form (each a ""temporary Global Note"") or a permanent global note in bearer form (each a ""permanent Global Note"" and together with the temporary Global Notes  the ""Global Notes""). If the Global Notes are stated in the applicable Final Terms to be issued in new global note (""NGN"") form  the Global Notes will be delivered on or prior to the original issue date of the relevant Tranche to a common safekeeper (the ""Common Safekeeper"") for Euroclear Bank SA/NV (""Euroclear"") and Clearstream Banking  S.A.

Global Notes which are not issued in NGN form (""Classic Global Notes"" or ""CGNs"") will be deposited on the issue date of the relevant Tranche with a common depositary on behalf of Euroclear and Clearstream  Luxembourg (the ""Common Depositary""). The provisions governing the exchange of interests in Global Notes for other Global Notes and definitive Notes are described in ""Overview of Provisions Relating to the Notes while in Global Form"". Tranches of Notes will be rated or unrated. Where a Tranche of Notes is to be rated  such rating will be specified in the relevant Final Terms. Whether or not a rating in relation to any Tranche of Notes will be treated as having been (i) issued or endorsed by a credit rating agency established in the European Union (the ""EU"") and registered under Regulation (EC) 1060/2009 on credit rating agencies (the ""EU CRA Regulation"") and/or (ii) issued or endorsed by a credit rating agency established in the United Kingdom and registered or certified under Regulation (EU) No 1060/2009 as it forms part of the domestic law of the United Kingdom by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (the ""UK CRA Regulation"") will be disclosed in the relevant Final Terms. A list of registered credit rating agencies is published at the European Securities and Market Authority's website: http://www.esma.europa.eu/page/List-registered-and-certified-CRAs. A rating is not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold securities and may be subject to suspension  reduction or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. This Base Prospectus will be valid as a base prospectus under the Prospectus Regulation for 12 months from 10 May 2024 (i.e.  until and including 10 May 2025).

The Arranger and the Dealers have not separately verified the information contained in this Base Prospectus. To the fullest extent permitted by law  none of the Dealers or the Arranger makes any representation  express or implied  or accepts any responsibility for the contents of this Base Prospectus (including the information contained or incorporated by reference in this Base Prospectus)  the accuracy or completeness of any of the information in this Base Prospectus or for any other statement  made or purported to be made by the Arranger or a Dealer or on its behalf in connection with the Issuer or the issue and offering of the Notes. The Arranger and each Dealer accordingly disclaim all and any liability whether arising in tort or contract or otherwise (save as referred to above) which it 4might otherwise have in respect of this Base Prospectus or any such statement. Neither this Base Prospectus nor any other financial statements are intended to provide the basis of any credit or other evaluation and should not be considered as a recommendation by any of the Issuer  the Arranger or the Dealers that any recipient of this Base Prospectus or any other financial statements should purchase the Notes. Each potential purchaser of Notes should determine for itself the relevance of the information contained in this Base Prospectus and its purchase of Notes should be based upon such investigation as it deems necessary.

In connection with the issue of any Tranche of Notes  the Dealer or Dealers (if any) acting as Stabilisation Manager(s) (or persons acting on behalf of any Stabilisation Manager(s)) as specified in the applicable Final Terms may over- allot Notes or effect transactions with a view to supporting the market price of the Notes at a level higher than that which might otherwise prevail. However  stabilisation may not necessarily occur. Any stabilisation action may begin on or after the date on which adequate public disclosure of the terms of the offer of the relevant Tranche of Notes is made and  if begun  cease at any time  but it must end no later than the earlier of 30 days after the issue date of the relevant Tranche of Notes and 60 days after the date of the allotment of the relevant Tranche of Notes. Any stabilisation action or over-allotment must be conducted by the relevant Stabilisation Manager(s) (or any person(s) acting on behalf of any Stabilisation Manager(s)) in accordance with all applicable laws and rules. In this Base Prospectus  unless otherwise specified or the context otherwise requires  references to Euro and € are to the currency introduced at the start of the third stage of European economic and monetary union pursuant to the Treaty establishing the European Community  as amended. Certain figures included in this Base Prospectus have been subject to rounding adjustments; accordingly  figures shown for the same category presented in different tables may vary slightly and figures shown as totals in certain tables may not be an arithmetic aggregation of the figures which precede them. The language of this Base Prospectus is English. Certain legislative references and technical terms have been cited in their original language in order that the correct technical meaning may be ascribed to them under applicable law. The aggregate nominal amount of Notes outstanding under the Programme will not at any time exceed Euro 6 000 000 000 and  for this purpose  any Notes denominated in another currency shall be translated into Euro at the date of the agreement to issue such Notes (calculated in accordance with the provisions of the Dealer Agreement). The maximum aggregate nominal amount of Notes which may be outstanding at any one time under the Programme may be increased from time to time  subject to compliance with the relevant provisions of the Dealer Agreement. NO ACTIVE TRADING MARKET Notes issued under the Programme will be new securities which may not be widely distributed and for which there is currently no active trading market (unless  in the case of any particular Tranche  such Tranche is to be consolidated with and form a single series with an outstanding Tranche of Notes). If the Notes are traded after their initial issuance  they may trade at a discount to their initial offering price  depending upon prevailing interest rates  the market for similar securities  general economic conditions and the financial condition of the Issuer. Although application has been made to the Luxembourg Stock Exchange for Notes issued under the Programme during the period of 12 months after the date of this Base Prospectus to be admitted to the official list and to trading on its regulated market  there is no assurance that such applications will be accepted  that any particular Tranche of Notes will be so admitted or that 5an active trading market will develop. Accordingly  there is no assurance as to the development or liquidity of any trading market for any particular Tranche of Notes. LEGAL INVESTMENT CONSIDERATIONS MAY RESTRICT CERTAIN INVESTMENT The investment activities of certain investors are subject to legal investment laws and regulations  or review or regulation by certain authorities. Each potential investor should consult its legal advisers to determine whether and to what extent: (i) Notes are legal investments for it; (ii) Notes can be used as collateral for various types of borrowing; and (iii) other restrictions apply to its purchase or pledge of any Notes. Financial institutions should consult their legal advisers or the appropriate regulators to determine the appropriate treatment of Notes under any applicable risk-based capital or similar rules. NOTES MAY NOT BE A SUITABLE INVESTMENT FOR ALL INVESTORS Each potential investor in any Notes must determine the suitability of that investment in light of its own circumstances. In particular  each potential investor should: have sufficient knowledge and experience to make a meaningful evaluation of the relevant Notes  the merits and risks of investing in the relevant Notes and the information contained or incorporated by reference in this Base Prospectus or any applicable supplement; have access to  and knowledge of  appropriate analytical tools to evaluate  in the context of its particular financial situation  an investment in the relevant Notes and the impact such investment will have on its overall investment portfolio; have sufficient financial resources and liquidity to bear all of the risks of an investment in the relevant Notes  including where principal or interest is payable in one or more currencies  or where the currency for principal or interest payments is different from the potential investor's currency; understand thoroughly the terms of the relevant Notes and be familiar with the behaviour of any relevant indices and financial markets; and be able to evaluate (either alone or with the help of a financial adviser) possible scenarios for economic  interest rate and other factors that may affect its investment and its ability to bear the applicable risks. Some Notes are complex financial instruments and such instruments may be purchased as a way to reduce risk or enhance yield with an understood  measured  appropriate addition of risk to their overall portfolios. A potential investor should not invest in Notes which are complex financial instruments unless it has the expertise (either alone or with the help of a financial adviser) to evaluate how the Notes will perform under changing conditions  the resulting effects on the value of such Notes and the impact this investment will have on the potential investor's overall investment portfolio.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This Base Prospectus includes statements that are  or may be deemed to be  forward-looking statements.

These forward-looking statements include all matters that are not historical facts. They appear in a number of places throughout this Base Prospectus and include  but are not limited to  statements regarding the Issuer's intentions  beliefs or current expectations concerning  among other things  the Issuer's results of operations  financial position  prospects  anticipated growth  Business Strategy  financing strategies  prospects for sourcing  acquiring and relationships with tenants  liquidity of the Issuer's assets  the state of the Spanish and Portuguese and global economy and expectations for the Spanish and Portuguese real estate industry and elsewhere. By their nature  forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to future events and circumstances. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the actual results of the Issuer's operations and the development of the markets and the industry in which the Issuer operates  may differ materially from those described in  or suggested by  the forward-looking statements contained in this Base Prospectus. In addition  even if the Issuer's results of operations  financial position and growth  and the development of the markets and the industry in which the Issuer operates  are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this Base Prospectus  those results or developments may not be indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods. A number of factors could cause results and developments of the Issuer to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements including  without limitation  general economic and business conditions  Spanish and Portuguese real estate market conditions  industry trends  competition  changes in law or regulation  changes in taxation regimes or development planning regime  the availability and cost of capital  currency fluctuations  changes in its Business Strategy  political and economic uncertainty and other factors discussed in ""Risk Factors"". The Issuer undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements and will not publicly release any revisions it may make to these forward-looking statements that may occur due to any change in the Issuer's expectations or to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Base Prospectus  except where required by applicable law. Given the uncertainty inherent in forward-looking statements  prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these statements. The Dealers assume no responsibility or liability for  and make no representations  warranty or assurance whatsoever in respect of  any of the forward-looking statements contained in this Base Prospectus. ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES The financial data included and incorporated by reference in this Base Prospectus  in addition to the conventional financial performance measures established by IFRS-EU  contains certain alternative performance measures (as defined in the ESMA Guidelines on Alternative Performance Measures) (""APMs"") that are presented for purposes of providing investors with a better understanding of the financial performance of the Group  its cash flows or financial position as they are used by the Company when managing its business. The relevant metrics are identified as APMs and accompanied by an explanation of each such metric's components in Appendix 5 to the 2023 Consolidated Management Report accompanying the consolidated financial statements of the Issuer and Note 14 of the 2022 Consolidated Management Report accompanying the consolidated financial statements of the Issuer  both of which are incorporated by reference in this Base Prospectus. Such measures should not be considered as a substitute for those required by IFRS-EU. PROHIBITION OF SALES TO EEA RETAIL INVESTORS The Notes are not intended to be offered  sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered  sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (""EEA""). For these purposes  a retail 7investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (""MiFID II""); (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97  as amended (the ""Insurance Distribution Directive"")  where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Regulation. Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended the ""PRIIPs Regulation"") for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation. MIFID II product governance / professional investors and ECPs only target market - The Final Terms in respect of any Notes may include a legend entitled ""MiFID II Product Governance"" which will outline the target market assessment in respect of the Notes and which channels for distribution of the Notes are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering  selling or recommending the Notes (a ""distributor"") should take into consideration the target market assessment; however  a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels. A determination will be made in relation to each issue about whether  for the purpose of the MiFID Product Governance rules under EU Delegated Directive 2017/593 (the ""MiFID Product Governance Rules"")  any Dealer subscribing for any Notes is a manufacturer in respect of such Notes  but otherwise neither the Arranger nor the Dealers nor any of their respective affiliates will be a manufacturer for the purpose of the MiFID Product Governance Rules.

Consequently  no key information document required by the PRIIPs Regulation as it forms part of domestic law by virtue of the EUWA (the ""UK PRIIPs Regulation"") for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the UK has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the UK may be unlawful under the UK PRIIPs Regulation. UK MiFIR product governance / professional investors and ECPs only target market - The Final Terms in respect of any Notes may include a legend entitled ""UK MiFIR Product Governance"" which will outline the target market assessment in respect of the Notes and which channels for distribution of the Notes are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering  selling or recommending the Notes (a ""distributor"") should take into consideration the target market assessment; however  a distributor subject to the FCA Handbook Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook (the ""UK MiFIR Product Governance Rules"") is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels. A determination will be made in relation to each issue about whether  for the purpose of the UK MiFIR Product Governance Rules  any Dealer subscribing for any Notes is a manufacturer in respect of such Notes  but otherwise neither the Arranger nor the Dealers nor any of their respective affiliates will be a manufacturer for the purpose of the UK MIFIR Product Governance Rules.

The CSSF only approves this Base Prospectus as meeting the standards of completeness  comprehensibility and consistency imposed by the Prospectus Regulation. Such approval should not be considered as an endorsement of either the Issuer or the quality of the Notes that are the subject of this Base Prospectus and investors should make their own assessment as to the suitability of investing in the Notes. The CSSF assumes no responsibility as to the economic and financial soundness of the issue of any Notes or the quality or solvency of the Issuer in line with the provisions of article 6(4) of the Luxembourg Act dated 16 July 2019 relating to prospectuses for securities.

The provisions governing the exchange of interests in Global Notes for other Global Notes and definitive Notes are described in ""Overview of Provisions Relating to the Notes while in Global Form"". Tranches of Notes will be rated or unrated. Where a Tranche of Notes is to be rated  such rating will be specified in the relevant Final Terms. Whether or not a rating in relation to any Tranche of Notes will be treated as having been (i) issued or endorsed by a credit rating agency established in the European Union (the ""EU"") and registered under Regulation (EC) 1060/2009 on credit rating agencies (the ""EU CRA Regulation"") and/or (ii) issued or endorsed by a credit rating agency established in the United Kingdom and registered or certified under Regulation (EU) No 1060/2009 as it forms part of the domestic law of the United Kingdom by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (the ""UK CRA Regulation"") will be disclosed in the relevant Final Terms. A list of registered credit rating agencies is published at the European Securities and Market Authority's website: http://www.esma.europa.eu/page/List-registered-and-certified-CRAs.

Neither this Base Prospectus nor any other financial statements are intended to provide the basis of any credit or other evaluation and should not be considered as a recommendation by any of the Issuer  the Arranger or the Dealers that any recipient of this Base Prospectus or any other financial statements should purchase the Notes.

However  stabilisation may not necessarily occur. Any stabilisation action may begin on or after the date on which adequate public disclosure of the terms of the offer of the relevant Tranche of Notes is made and  if begun  cease at any time  but it must end no later than the earlier of 30 days after the issue date of the relevant Tranche of Notes and 60 days after the date of the allotment of the relevant Tranche of Notes.

The maximum aggregate nominal amount of Notes which may be outstanding at any one time under the Programme may be increased from time to time  subject to compliance with the relevant provisions of the Dealer Agreement. NO ACTIVE TRADING MARKET Notes issued under the Programme will be new securities which may not be widely distributed and for which there is currently no active trading market (unless  in the case of any particular Tranche  such Tranche is to be consolidated with and form a single series with an outstanding Tranche of Notes). If the Notes are traded after their initial issuance  they may trade at a discount to their initial offering price  depending upon prevailing interest rates  the market for similar securities  general economic conditions and the financial condition of the Issuer. Although application has been made to the Luxembourg Stock Exchange for Notes issued under the Programme during the period of 12 months after the date of this Base Prospectus to be admitted to the official list and to trading on its regulated market  there is no assurance that such applications will be accepted  that any particular Tranche of Notes will be so admitted or that 5an active trading market will develop. Accordingly  there is no assurance as to the development or liquidity of any trading market for any particular Tranche of Notes. LEGAL INVESTMENT CONSIDERATIONS MAY RESTRICT CERTAIN INVESTMENT The investment activities of certain investors are subject to legal investment laws and regulations  or review or regulation by certain authorities. Each potential investor should consult its legal advisers to determine whether and to what extent: (i) Notes are legal investments for it; (ii) Notes can be used as collateral for various types of borrowing; and (iii) other restrictions apply to its purchase or pledge of any Notes. Financial institutions should consult their legal advisers or the appropriate regulators to determine the appropriate treatment of Notes under any applicable risk-based capital or similar rules. NOTES MAY NOT BE A SUITABLE INVESTMENT FOR ALL INVESTORS Each potential investor in any Notes must determine the suitability of that investment in light of its own circumstances. In particular  each potential investor should: have sufficient knowledge and experience to make a meaningful evaluation of the relevant Notes  the merits and risks of investing in the relevant Notes and the information contained or incorporated by reference in this Base Prospectus or any applicable supplement; have access to  and knowledge of  appropriate analytical tools to evaluate  in the context of its particular financial situation  an investment in the relevant Notes and the impact such investment will have on its overall investment portfolio; have sufficient financial resources and liquidity to bear all of the risks of an investment in the relevant Notes  including where principal or interest is payable in one or more currencies  or where the currency for principal or interest payments is different from the potential investor's currency; understand thoroughly the terms of the relevant Notes and be familiar with the behaviour of any relevant indices and financial markets; and be able to evaluate (either alone or with the help of a financial adviser) possible scenarios for economic  interest rate and other factors that may affect its investment and its ability to bear the applicable risks. Some Notes are complex financial instruments and such instruments may be purchased as a way to reduce risk or enhance yield with an understood  measured  appropriate addition of risk to their overall portfolios. A potential investor should not invest in Notes which are complex financial instruments unless it has the expertise (either alone or with the help of a financial adviser) to evaluate how the Notes will perform under changing conditions  the resulting effects on the value of such Notes and the impact this investment will have on the potential investor's overall investment portfolio.

The purchaser should refer to any applicable provisions of the securities legislation of the purchaser's province or territory for particulars of these rights or consult with a legal adviser. Pursuant to section 3A.3 (or  in the case of securities issued or guaranteed by the government of a non-Canadian jurisdiction  section 3A.4) of National Instrument 33-105 Underwriting Conflicts (NI 33-105)  6the Dealers are not required to comply with the disclosure requirements of NI 33-105 regarding underwriter conflicts of interest in connection with any Notes issued under the Programme. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS This Base Prospectus includes statements that are  or may be deemed to be  forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of forward-looking terminology  including the terms ""anticipates""  ""believes""  ""estimates""  ""expects""  ""intends""  ""may""  ""plans""  ""projects""  ""should"" or ""will""  or  in each case  their negative or other variations or comparable terminology  or by discussions of strategy  plans  targets  objectives  goals  future events or intentions. These forward-looking statements include all matters that are not historical facts. They appear in a number of places throughout this Base Prospectus and include  but are not limited to  statements regarding the Issuer's intentions  beliefs or current expectations concerning  among other things  the Issuer's results of operations  financial position  prospects  anticipated growth  Business Strategy  financing strategies  prospects for sourcing  acquiring and relationships with tenants  liquidity of the Issuer's assets  the state of the Spanish and Portuguese and global economy and expectations for the Spanish and Portuguese real estate industry and elsewhere. By their nature  forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to future events and circumstances. Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and the actual results of the Issuer's operations and the development of the markets and the industry in which the Issuer operates  may differ materially from those described in  or suggested by  the forward-looking statements contained in this Base Prospectus. In addition  even if the Issuer's results of operations  financial position and growth  and the development of the markets and the industry in which the Issuer operates  are consistent with the forward-looking statements contained in this Base Prospectus  those results or developments may not be indicative of results or developments in subsequent periods. A number of factors could cause results and developments of the Issuer to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements including  without limitation  general economic and business conditions  Spanish and Portuguese real estate market conditions  industry trends  competition  changes in law or regulation  changes in taxation regimes or development planning regime  the availability and cost of capital  currency fluctuations  changes in its Business Strategy  political and economic uncertainty and other factors discussed in ""Risk Factors"". The Issuer undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements and will not publicly release any revisions it may make to these forward-looking statements that may occur due to any change in the Issuer's expectations or to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Base Prospectus  except where required by applicable law. Given the uncertainty inherent in forward-looking statements  prospective investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these statements. The Dealers assume no responsibility or liability for  and make no representations  warranty or assurance whatsoever in respect of  any of the forward-looking statements contained in this Base Prospectus. ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES The financial data included and incorporated by reference in this Base Prospectus  in addition to the conventional financial performance measures established by IFRS-EU  contains certain alternative performance measures (as defined in the ESMA Guidelines on Alternative Performance Measures) (""APMs"") that are presented for purposes of providing investors with a better understanding of the financial performance of the Group  its cash flows or financial position as they are used by the Company when managing its business. The relevant metrics are identified as APMs and accompanied by an explanation of each such metric's components in Appendix 5 to the 2023 Consolidated Management Report accompanying the consolidated financial statements of the Issuer and Note 14 of the 2022 Consolidated Management Report accompanying the consolidated financial statements of the Issuer  both of which are incorporated by reference in this Base Prospectus. Such measures should not be considered as a substitute for those required by IFRS-EU. PROHIBITION OF SALES TO EEA RETAIL INVESTORS The Notes are not intended to be offered  sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered  sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (""EEA""). For these purposes  a retail 7investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (""MiFID II""); (ii) a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97  as amended (the ""Insurance Distribution Directive"")  where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii) not a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Regulation. Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended the ""PRIIPs Regulation"") for offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Notes or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation. MIFID II product governance / professional investors and ECPs only target market - The Final Terms in respect of any Notes may include a legend entitled ""MiFID II Product Governance"" which will outline the target market assessment in respect of the Notes and which channels for distribution of the Notes are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering  selling or recommending the Notes (a ""distributor"") should take into consideration the target market assessment; however  a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Notes (by either adopting or refining the target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels. A determination will be made in relation to each issue about whether  for the purpose of the MiFID Product Governance rules under EU Delegated Directive 2017/593 (the ""MiFID Product Governance Rules"")  any Dealer subscribing for any Notes is a manufacturer in respect of such Notes  but otherwise neither the Arranger nor the Dealers nor any of their respective affiliates will be a manufacturer for the purpose of the MiFID Product Governance Rules. PROHIBITION OF SALES TO UK RETAIL INVESTORS The Notes are not intended to be offered  sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered  sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the United Kingdom (the ""UK"").

In addition  the nomination committee proposes that a total fee of EUR 25 000 shall be allotted to the chairman of the audit committee as well as to the chairman of the remuneration committee. These fees shall apply for a full period between the election and the next annual general meeting. This means that the board fees amount to  in total  EUR 400 000  provided that the annual general meeting resolves to increase the maximum number of board members as set out in the articles of association and to EUR 350 000 should the annual general meeting not resolve to increase the number of board members (item 9).That fees to the auditor shall be paid in accordance with approved invoice (item 9).Provided that the annual general meeting resolves to increase the maximum number of board members  that the board of directors shall comprise seven directors. Should the annual general meeting not resolve to increase the maximum number of board members as set out in the articles of association  the board of directors shall comprise six directors (item 10).That the company shall have one auditor (item 10).Provided that the annual general meeting resolves to increase the maximum number of board members as set out in the articles of association  re-election of the board members Elizabeth Para  Franca Ruhwedel  Johan Roslund and Remco Westermann  and the election of Greg Coleman and Peter Huijboom as new board members  as well as re-election of Tobias M.

Weitzel as member and chairman of the board of directors for the period until the close of the annual general meeting 2025 (item 11).Re-election of the company's auditor Deloitte Sweden AB for the period until the close of the annual general meeting 2025.

The nomination committee's complete proposals  including a presentation of the proposed members of the board of directors and an assessment of their independence in relation to the company  the executive management and the company's major shareholders  are available on the company's website (www.mgi-se.com). Item 12(a)-(b). Resolutions on (a) change of the company name by amendment of paragraph 1 of the articles of association and (b) amendment of paragraph 3 of the articles of association The board of directors proposes a change of the company name by amendment of paragraph 1 of the articles of association and  in connection with this  an amendment of paragraph 3 of the articles of association. The changes are proposed in order to mark the completion of the company's transformation into a leading digital media company. The proposals under item 12 of the agenda consist of (a) change of the company name by amendment of paragraph 1 of the articles of association and (b) an amendment of the articles of association and are conditional on each other; thus the board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting's resolutions under item 12 shall be adopted as a single and joint resolution. The resolutions under item 12 are valid only if supported by shareholders holding at least two-thirds of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the annual general meeting. (a) Resolution on change of the company name by amendment of paragraph 1 of the articles of association The board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to change the name of the company to Verve Group SE. The proposal to change the name of the company marks the completion of the company's transformation into a leading digital media company. Over the past years  MGI has strategically shifted its focus towards becoming an integrated digital media company  operating a fast-growing  profitable ad-software platform that matches global advertiser demand with publisher ad-supply while having a strong competitive advantage based on data and AI. The rebranding is a logical next step within this transformation. Based on the advertising part already working with the brand Verve Group  it makes sense to now introduce the Verve brand for the entire company  emphasising today's as well as future focus of the company. The gaming subsidiaries of MGI which support the media business strongly with unique ad-inventory  data and testing environments  will continue to operate under their own brands. The change requires paragraph 1 of the articles of association to be amended accordingly. The board of directors  the CEO or such person as the board of directors authorise  shall be authorised to make such minor amendments and clarifications of the annual general meeting's decision that is required in connection with the registration of this resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office. (b) Resolution on amendment of paragraph 3 of the articles of association In order to align the articles of association with the company's transformation into a leading digital media company and the name change proposed under item 12(a) above  the board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to replace paragraph 3 of the articles of association  objects of the company  as follows: Current wording: The company shall directly or through subsidiaries conduct operations that include (a) distribution of and trade with computer-  console- and video- and mobile games  as distributor  licensee and developer to consumers and business partners and provide online platforms for such games  (b) media activities for advertisers as well as publishers and other connected platforms and partners  to sell and buy ads and to provide the technical platforms and processes as well as data for that  (c) manage and acquire tangible and intangible assets (including majority as well as minority participations) and conduct operations compatible therewith  and (d) any other activities including financing of the herefore mentioned activities. New wording: The company shall conduct operations that include (a)  directly or indirectly through subsidiaries  media activities for advertisers as well as publishers and other connected platforms and partners  to sell and buy ads and to provide the technical platforms and processes as well as data for that  as well as conduct operations compatible therewith and (b)  indirectly through subsidiaries  distribution of and trade with computer-  console- and video- and mobile games  as distributor  licensee and developer to consumers and business partners and provide online platforms for such games. The board of directors  the CEO or such person as the board of directors authorise  shall be authorised to make such minor amendments and clarifications of the annual general meeting's decision that is required in connection with the registration of this resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office. Item 13(a)-(c). Resolutions on (a) the establishment of LTIP 2024  (b) delivery of Shares under the LTIP 2024 through an issue and transfer of warrants of series 2024/2036 and (c) delivery of Shares under the LTIP 2024 through hedging arrangements with a third party (a) Resolution on the establishment of LTIP 2024 Background and purpose The board of directors proposes that the general meeting resolves to establish a new long-term incentive program (""LTIP 2024""). The MGI group is international  with the majority of its revenue and a substantial part of its operations in North America  and thus competes for talent globally. In order to attract and retain talent for key positions it is important that MGI can offer its key employees a competitive remuneration package. This includes being able to offer similar types of compensation as its global competitors  an important component of which is a competitive LTIP program. The proposed LTIP 2024 is similar to the company'sexisting and historical incentive programs that are approaching the end of their duration and is designed to retain and motivate the group's senior key employees. The program is intended to span three years (36 months) from 30 June 2024  with an allocation to participantsspread over the duration of the 36 months program. The purpose of proposing a multiyear program is to give the shareholders greater visibility over potential dilution and to give better foreseeability for participantsas well as to provide flexibility for the company to adapt allocation during the span of the program to cater for inter alia such years when there are more new hires that the company deems shall be encompassed by the program. Approximately 50 key employees  including the top management of the company and certain subsidiaries  will be entitled to participate in the LTIP 2024. The purpose of the LTIP 2024 is to give the participantsan opportunity to take part in a potential increase in the value of the MGI shares  thereby ensuring that the participants' interests are aligned with shareholder interests. Subject to the terms and conditions of the LTIP 2024  the companywill award restricted stock options (""RSOs"") to members of the MGI group's top management  including the CEO  and to other key employees (the ""Participants""). Main terms The RSOs shall be allocated by the board of directors  pursuant to the following main principles (which will be reflected in agreements with each Participant): The maximum number of RSOs that may be granted per each consecutive twelve-month period is 2 300 000 and the maximum number of RSOs that may be granted under the LTIP 2024 is 4 750 000  which can be used to acquire a maximum of 4 750 000 of the company's shares of Class A ("" Shares ""). The aforementioned three consecutive twelve-month periods shall be: 30 June 2024-29 June 2025  30 June 2025-29 June 2026 and 30 June 2026-30 June 2027. The maximum number of RSOs that may be granted is equivalent to a maximum potential average dilution of less than 1.0% per twelve-month period provided an equal part of the maximum number of RSOs are granted each such period and less than 3.0% over the entire duration of the LTIP 2024. If the maximum number of RSOs that may be allocated during one twelve-month period has not been allocated to Participants such period the remainder may be granted in subsequent periods. The RSOs can be exercised to acquire Shares at a strike price equivalent to the higher of EUR 2.00 and 120% of the Share price in connection with the Date of Grant  as further described under ""Price and other terms"" below. The RSOs will be granted to up to 50 Participants. The maximum number of RSOs that can be awarded to any Participant  including the CEO  in one year is 500 000. A Participant may only be granted RSOs once each consecutive twelve-month period during the duration of LTIP 2024. RSOs may be granted to Participants  as of the last business day of the first three quarters each consecutive twelve-month period during the duration of LTIP 2024 (provided for the avoidance of doubt that no RSOs may be granted for the first quarter of 2024). A date on which RSOs are granted is referred to as a "" Date of Grant "". All granted RSOs are subject to being earned and vesting prior to being exercised  each as further described below. If applicable insider rules and regulations prohibit a Participant from being granted RSOs at any of the dates set out above  or in other extraordinary circumstances  the board of directors has the right to postpone the Date of Grant for a Participant. The Participants will earn RSOs each of the first four yearly anniversaries following the applicable Date of Grant (each an "" Earn Event "" where granted RSOs are "" Earned ""). The Participants will Earn 15% at the first Earn Event  25% at the second Earn Event  25% at the third Earn Event and the remaining 35% at the fourth Earn Event until all RSOs granted at a Date of Grant have been Earned after four years from such Date of Grant. The period from a Date of Grant until the fourth Earn Event is referred to as the "" Earn Period "". The RSOs will vest on the date falling two years after each respective Earn Event (meaning that the first 15% of the RSOs will vest three years from each Participant's Date of Grant). If a Participant leaves the MGI group earlier than two years after such Participant's first Date of Grant  all of the Participant's RSOs are lost. However  if a Participant leaves the MGI group more than two years after such Participant's first Date of Grant  such Participant shall be entitled to keep all of his or hers vested RSOs as well as 50% of his or hers Earned but unvested RSOs  and the Participant will not be subject to any additional Earn Events. Any RSOs not exercised at the latest 30 months after a Participant has left the MGI group shall lapse without any compensation to the Participant. The board of directors shall be responsible for the detailed terms and the administration of the LTIP 2024 within the scope and framework of this proposal. Price and other terms Each vested RSO entitles the Participant to acquire one Share at a price equivalent to the higher of (i) EUR 2.00 and (ii) 120% of the average closing price of the Share on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (Xetra) during the period of twenty (20) trading days immediately prior to each relevant Date of Grant (the ""Strike Price""). Participants can exercise vested RSOs as of the last business day of the first three quarters each year (each an ""Exercise Date"")  starting on the date falling two years from the relevant Earn Event (i.e.  on the vesting date) and ending on the date falling three years thereafter (i.e.  five years after the relevant Earn Event). If applicable insider rules and regulations prohibit a Participant from exercising its RSOs at any of the applicable Exercise Dates  the board of directors has the right to postpone the Exercise Date for such Participant. The agreements with the Participants shall include provisions regulating the event of a change in control of the company(meaning a party  or several parties acting in concert  acquiring shares representing more than 90 percent of the votes in the company) or a direct or indirect sale  transfer or other disposal of all or substantially all of the business and assets  in which case any Earned RSOs  plus those that pro rata in relation to the actual time lapsed since the previous Earn Event  would be Earned during that year  and any vested but not already exercised  RSOs shall become exercisable. The maximum number of Shares the RSOs entitle to subscription for and the Strike Price shall be recalculated based on  and in the event of such circumstances set out in  the terms and conditions of the warrants under the Warrant Hedge Arrangement proposed below. The LTIP 2024 will be governed by Swedish law  unless to the extent mandatory applicable law applicable to a Participant requires otherwise. Performance criteria The initial allocation of RSOs to Participants under the LTIP 2024 shall be determined based on the Participants' level of responsibility as well as individual performance. The performance metrics include both financial criteria such as revenue growth and cost control and responsibility and non-financial criteria  such as e.g. onboarding new customers  meeting product or engineering goals. Further  the value of the RSOs is linked to the economic value added by the Participants and as such the equity value of the company. Participants only get the value add  based on the Share price development; i.e. the value of the Share at the Exercise Date minus the Strike Price. Consequently  in order for the RSOs to have any value  MGI'sShare price needs to increase by more than 20% compared to the Share price during the measurement period (as described above). The board of directors thus considers the Participant's incentives to be aligned with MGI'sshareholders without additional performance criteria for the exercise of the RSOs. Delivery of Shares and hedging The board of directors has considered two alternatives for delivering Shares to Participants in the LTIP 2024. Firstly  the board of directors recommends  in accordance with the proposal under item 13(b) on the proposed agenda  that the company issues warrants to a subsidiary or to the company and that the subsidiary or the company may dispose of the warrants in order to ensure the company'sobligations under the LTIP 2024 (the ""Warrant Hedge Arrangement""). However  if the annual general meeting does not resolve on the Warrant Hedge Arrangement  the board of directors has also considered another alternative  a so called swap agreement as proposed under item 13(c) on the proposed agenda. This alternative entails higher costs for MGI  and is therefore only intended to be exercised if the Warrant Hedge Arrangement is not approved by the annual general meeting. In the event a Participant cannot receive Shares under applicable laws or regulations or at reasonable cost or with reasonable administrative effort by the Participant or the company or if otherwise deemed suitable by the board of directors  the board of directors shall have the right to decide to settle the RSOs: (i) wholly or partly in cash (including for the purpose of allowing the Participants to fund the subscription price for Shares through exercise of warrants)  (ii) through the delivery of part of the Shares or warrants against a lower Strike Price  (iii) through a ""net settlement"" whereby a number of warrants are allocated to a Participant for free corresponding to the net value of the Participant's RSOs  or (iv) through a combination thereof. The board of directors shall also have the right to  in its own discretion  decide that Shares  warrants and/or cash shall be withheld by the company in order to cover or facilitate the payment of applicable taxes. Only whole warrants (no fractions) may be delivered to a Participant to settle the company'sobligation under LTIP 2024 and the number of warrants delivered to a Participant in the settlement shall thus be rounded down to the nearest number of whole warrants. Dilution effect The maximum dilution effect will be approximately 3.0 percent if all RSOs are settled in Shares and consequently maximally 4 750 000 warrants of series 2024/2036 are exercised for subscription of up to 4 750 000 new Shares in the company. In the event of a full or partial cash or net settlement  the dilution would be substantially lower than the number of RSOs distributed. If the warrant settlement method proposed under item 13(b)of the proposed agenda is not approved with the requisite majority and the company'sobligations under the LTIP 2024 are settled by way of an equity swap arrangement with a third party proposed under item 13(c)  no dilution effect will arise. Costs The costs for the LTIP 2024 are based on the IFRS 2 reporting standards and will be amortised over the Earn Period. The board of directors has made a preliminary cost calculation for the LTIP 2024  which is based on a share price at the Date of Grant of EUR 1.66  a Strike Price of EUR 2  that all granted RSOs are Earned following the Earn Period and a time period from the granting of the RSOs to exercise of 6.47 years. On the basis of the above assumptions  the value of each RSO has  using a Black & Scholes simulation model been set at EUR 0.85 which implies expected costs for the LTIP 2024 of approximately EUR 4.00 million. No other material costs  including social security costs  are expected in relation to the LTIP 2024. Other share-based incentive programs in MGI For information about other share-based incentive programs in MGI  please refer to the company'sannual report 2024 (see section ""Equity-settled share-based payment transactions""). These main terms are also available on the company's website (www.mgi-se.com). Other than as described therein there are no other share-based incentive schemes in MGI. Preparation of the proposal The LTIP 2024 has been prepared by the company'sremuneration committee and has been adopted by the board of directors. Authorisation Each of the members of board of directors  or such person as the board of directors authorise  shall be authorised to make such minor adjustments to this resolution that may be required for the registration with the Swedish Companies Registration Office  Euroclear Sweden AB or any other CSD than Euroclear Sweden AB. The board of directors shall have the right to undertake minor adjustments to the LTIP 2024 due to applicable foreign rules and laws  applicable law  regulation  market practice or otherwise. Majority requirement and conditions for the resolution A resolution in accordance with the board of directors' proposal regarding the establishment of the LTIP 2024 under this item 13(a) of the proposed agenda requires support from shareholders representing more than half of the votes cast at the general meeting. The resolution shall be conditional upon that the general meeting resolves upon either of the board of director's proposals to secure the delivery of Shares under the LTIP 2024 under items 13(b) or 13(c) on the proposed agenda. (b) Resolution on delivery of Shares under the LTIP 2024 through an issue and transfer of warrants of series 2024/2036 Under the LTIP 2024 proposed by the board of directors under item 13(a) of the proposed agenda  the company has an obligation  subject to certain conditions  to deliver Shares to the Participants in the LTIP 2024. In order to secure the company'sobligation to deliver Shares and  to the extent permitted and possible  cover any costs (including taxes and social security charges)  the board of directors proposes that the general meeting resolves to issue and transfer up to 4 750 000 warrants of series 2024/2036 on the terms and conditions set out below. The board of directors considers the warrant settlement method to be the preferred alternative to the equity swap arrangement with a third party included in item 13(c) of the proposed agenda since the costs for an equity swap arrangement are significantly higher than the costs for issuing and transferring warrants.If the general meeting resolves to approve the proposed warrant settlement method under this item 13(b) with the requisite majority  the resolution under item 13(c)below will not be required. In order to secure the company'sobligation to deliver Shares under the LTIP 2024  the board of directors proposes that the general meeting resolves to issue and transfer warrants of series 2024/2036 in the company on the following terms and conditions: A maximum of 4 750 000 warrants of series 2024/2036 shall be issued. The right to subscribe for the warrants shall  with deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights vest with the company or a subsidiary to the company with the right and obligation to dispose of the warrants in accordance with the company's obligations under the LTIP 2024. The reason for the deviation from the shareholders' pre-emptive rights is to secure the company's obligations to deliver Shares and to cover any costs (including taxes and social security charges) under the LTIP 2024. Subscription for the warrants shall take place on a separate subscription list not later than on 27 June 2024. The warrants shall be issued without consideration. Each warrant shall entitle the holder to subscribe for one new Share (a share in the company of Class A). The exercise price for subscription for Shares based on the warrants shall correspond to the  at the time of exercise  quota value of a share in the company. The warrants may be exercised during the period from and including 30 June 2025 up to and including 31 December 2036. The new Shares shall carry rights to dividends for the first time on the record date for dividends that occurs after subscription has been effected. The number of Shares for which each warrant entitles subscription may be recalculated under certain circumstances as set forth in the complete terms and conditions for the warrants. Upon exercise of all 4 750 000 warrants  the company's share capital will increase by EUR 47 500 (based on a quota value of EUR 0.01 and with EUR 4 750 000 based on a quota value of EUR 1). The new Shares will be encompassed by the conversion clause in the company's articles of association. The company and the subsidiary as applicable may for the purpose of delivering Shares and secure its obligations under the LTIP 2024: transfer the warrants to Participants in LTIP 2024 without consideration whereby subscription of Shares is to be made through the exercise of the warrants and against payment of the quota value transfer the warrants to a third party with whom the company has entered into an agreement regarding exercising the warrants and delivery of Shares to Participants in LTIP 2024 in accordance with the terms and conditions for LTIP 2024  and/orotherwise disposes of the warrants in order to ensure the company's obligations in connection with LTIP 2024. The complete terms and conditions for the warrants of series 2024/2036  a copy of the company's articles of association  other information and documents according to the Swedish companies act will be available at the company and on the company'swebsite (www.mgi-se.com) not later than three weeks prior to the general meeting. A resolution in accordance with the board of directors' proposal requires support from shareholders representing not less than nine-tenths of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the general meeting. (c) Resolution on delivery of Shares under the LTIP 2024 through hedging arrangements with a third party As set out under items 13(a) and 13(b) above  the board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves that MGI  if the required majority for approval is not reached under item 13(b) above  may enter into agreements on hedging arrangements with a third party in order to ensure the company'sobligation to deliver Shares in accordance with LTIP 2024. Such arrangement would mean that MGI enters into an equity swap agreement with a third party for such third party to acquire Shares in its own name and thereafter transfers the Shares (or the corresponding value of a cash settlement  if applicable) to Participants in LTIP 2024. The resolution is conditional upon that the required majority for approval of item 13(b) above is not reached. Item 14. Resolution on an authorisation for the board of directors to resolve on issuance of shares  warrants and convertibles The board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to authorise the board of directors to  at one or several occasions and for the time period until the next annual general meeting  issue shares  warrants and convertibles within the limits of the company's articles of association. The authorisation shall be limited so that the board of directors may not resolve upon issues of shares  warrants and convertibles that entail that the total number of shares that are issued  issued through conversion of convertibles or issued through exercise of warrants exceeds 35% of the total number of shares in the company at the time the board of directors exercises the authorisation for the first time. Issues of shares  warrants and convertibles may be made with or without deviation from the shareholders' preferential rights and with or without provisions for payment in kind  set-off or other conditions. The purpose of the authorisation and the possibility to deviate from the shareholders' preferential rights shall be to finance acquisitions  raise capital to facilitate growth and development of the company or to hedge  facilitate or settle the company's incentive programs. The board of directors  the CEO or such person as the board of directors authorise  shall be authorised to make such minor amendments and clarifications of the annual general meeting's decision that is required in connection with the registration of this resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office. A resolution in accordance with this item 14 is only valid where supported by shareholders holding not less than two-thirds of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the annual general meeting. Items 15(a)-(b). Resolutions on (a) amendment of paragraph 4 of the articles of association and (b) reduction of the share capital The board of directors proposes an adjustment of the company's quota value from EUR 1 per share to EUR 0.01 per share. The adjustment is proposed in order to have a quota value which is more typical for Swedish companies and thus facilitate corporate actions in accordance with Swedish market practice  e.g.  possible future quota value issues  rights issues where a market standard discount is applied  share issues or efficient settlement of incentive programs and share based acquisitions. If the annual general meeting resolves on the amendment of paragraph 4 of the articles of association and the reduction of the share capital according to this item 15 on the proposed agenda  the board of directors intends to amend the terms of the outstanding warrants in the company to align inter alia the strike price with the new quota value. The proposals under item 15 of the agenda consist of (a) an amendment of paragraph 4 of the articles of association and (b) a reduction of the share capital and are conditional on each other; thus the board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting's resolutions under item 15 shall be adopted as a single and joint resolution. The resolutions under item 15 are valid only if supported by shareholders holding at least two-thirds of both the votes cast and the shares represented at the annual general meeting. (a) Resolution on amendment of paragraph 4 of the articles of association In order to enable the reduction of the share capital proposed under item 15(b) below  the board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves that the limitations with respect to the share capital in paragraph 4 of the company's articles of association  are amended so that the minimum share capital is EUR 1 550 000 and the maximum share capital is EUR 6 200 000. The board of directors  the CEO or such person as the board of directors authorise  shall be authorised to make such minor amendments and clarifications of the annual general meeting's decision that is required in connection with the registration of this resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office  Euroclear Sweden AB or any other CSD than Euroclear Sweden AB  or due to other formal requirements. (b) Resolution on a reduction of the share capital The board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves on a reduction of the share capital on the following terms and conditions. The share capital is to be reduced by EUR 157 656 864.42. The reduction of the share capital is to be effected without redemption of shares. The purpose of the reduction is allocation to unrestricted shareholders' equity in order to reduce the company's quota value. Following the reduction  the share capital will amount to EUR1 592 493.58 divided among 159 249 358 class A shares and 0 class B shares (i.e. 159 249 358 shares in total)  each with a quota value of EUR 0.01. The reduction of the share capital is subject to amendment of the articles of association pursuant to item 15(a) above. The company may not execute the reduction without approval from the Swedish Companies Registration Office or a public court  since the measures taken together result in a decrease in the company's restricted share capital. The board of directors  the CEO or such person as the board of directors authorise  shall be authorised to make such minor amendments and clarifications of the annual general meeting's decision that is required in connection with the registration of this resolution with the Swedish Companies Registration Office  Euroclear Sweden AB or any other CSD than Euroclear Sweden AB  or due to other formal requirements. SHAREHOLDERS' RIGHT TO REQUEST INFORMATION The board of directors and the CEO shall  if any shareholder so requests and the board of directors believes that it can be done without significant harm to the company  provide information in respect of any circumstances which may affect the assessment of a matter on the agenda and any circumstances that may affect the assessment of the company's financial position. The duty to provide information shall also apply to the company's relationship with another group company  the consolidated accounts and such circumstances regarding subsidiaries that are referred to in the preceding sentence.

(hereafter ""Unieuro"" and the ""Company"") (Euronext STAR Milan: UNIR)  Italy's leading distributor of consumer electronics and household appliances  at a meeting today chaired by Stefano Meloni  reviewed and approved the consolidated and separate financial statements for the fiscal year ended February 29  2024.Giancarlo Nicosanti Monterastelli  Chief Executive Officer of Unieuro  stated:""In the fiscal year just ended  against a challenging geopolitical and macroeconomic backdrop and faced with a further deterioration in the consumer electronics market  we worked to achieve dual objectives: to preserve the Group's profitability in the short term and to accelerate our medium to long-term growth trajectory.The results achieved  meeting the guidance communicated to the market  demonstrate the validity of our approach. In accordance with the Strategic Plan  we acquired Covercare  a transformative and crucial transaction for us that will improve the range of services and boost Group profitability"".In application of IFRS 5  the operating  equity and cash flow indicators for the fiscal year ended February 29  2024 do not include the contribution of Monclick S.r.l. in liquidation; the comparative figures for the previous fiscal year are therefore restated  where required. The newly-acquired Covercare S.p.A. and its subsidiaries (""Covercare"") have been consolidated as of December 1  2023.In FY 2023/24  the consumer electronics market was impacted for the second consecutive year by slowing demand  due both to the settling of certain product categories that had seen record growth over the preceding years and a reduction in consumer purchasing power. The overall market was worth Euro 15.8 billion  decreasing 6.9% on the previous fiscal year  although in excess of pre-pandemic levels.Within this challenging environment  Unieuro undertook direct initiatives to protect margins  focusing on the higher-marginsales channels and product categories  such as the White category  and those which favour in-store traffic  such as the Grey category  and implemented an efficiency plan involving all operating levers.The initiatives undertaken have enabled  from the second quarter  a gradual improvement of operating profitability on a quarterly basis on the comparable periods.In FY 2023/24  Unieuro confirmed its sector leadership with revenues of Euro 2 634.9 million and a substantially unchanged market share. The profitability and financial objectives were fully achieved  with Adjusted EBIT of Euro 34.8 million and Net cash of Euro 44.5 million in the fiscal year ended February 29  2024.In view of the current Dividend Policy  the Board of Directors approved the proposal to the Shareholders' Meeting to issue a dividend of Euro 0.46 per share  corresponding to a dividend yield of 5.0%5.",neutral,0.07,0.92,0.01,negative,0.01,0.42,0.57,True,English,"['Unieuro Sp.A.', 'FY 2023/24 Results', 'Board', 'Directors', 'Monclick S.r.l.', 'Covercare S.p.A.', 'Unieuro S.p.A.', 'Euronext STAR Milan', 'Giancarlo Nicosanti Monterastelli', 'Chief Executive Officer', 'consumer purchasing power', 'separate financial statements', 'long-term growth trajectory', 'cash flow indicators', 'current Dividend Policy', 'second consecutive year', 'previous fiscal year', 'consumer electronics market', 'record growth', 'second quarter', 'financial objectives', 'Net cash', 'overall market', 'PRESS RELEASE', 'leading distributor', 'household appliances', 'Stefano Meloni', 'challenging geopolitical', 'macroeconomic backdrop', 'dual objectives', 'short term', 'medium to', 'Strategic Plan', 'crucial transaction', 'operating, equity', 'comparative figures', 'product categories', 'preceding years', 'pre-pandemic levels', 'challenging environment', 'higher-marginsales channels', 'White category', 'store traffic', 'Grey category', 'efficiency plan', 'operating levers', 'gradual improvement', 'quarterly basis', 'comparable periods', 'sector leadership', 'Adjusted EBIT', 'dividend yield', 'market share', 'direct initiatives', 'operating profitability', ""Shareholders' Meeting"", 'Group profitability', 'Forlì', 'Board', 'Directors', 'Company', 'UNIR', 'Italy', 'deterioration', 'results', 'guidance', 'validity', 'approach', 'accordance', 'transformative', 'range', 'services', 'application', 'IFRS', 'contribution', 'liquidation', 'subsidiaries', 'December', 'FY', 'demand', 'settling', 'reduction', 'excess', 'revenues', 'unchanged', 'view', 'proposal']",2024-05-10,2024-05-11,marketscreener.com

In its May 2 webinar polling of more than 1 400 attendees  CT Corporation found that nearly 40% of respondents viewed keeping pace with ongoing reporting obligations as their top concern.“Submitting a company’s initial beneficial ownership reporting data by the specified deadline in no way means that this process is a one-time occurrence ” said Rupak Venugopal  Vice President  Beneficial Ownership  Wolters Kluwer Financial & Corporate Compliance. “As 39% of poll participants indicated  compliance will require ongoing due diligence and vigilance in keeping beneficial ownership information current with respect to reporting.”Other challenges cited by respondents include “Determining whether my business is subject to the reporting requirement ” at 25%  and “Identifying the beneficial owner(s) in an organization who are subject to the rule” at 24%. The remaining polling option  “Resource allocation of costs and staff time to gather and submit the required information ” was selected by 12% of respondents.CT Corporation conducted audience polling in conjunction with BOI compliance webinars it held in January 2024 and November 2023. The May 2 webinar marks the first time that attendees were asked to identify their biggest concerns around BOI compliance.Since last November’s polling  overall readiness levels for CTA compliance have shown modest increases: the percentage of those confident that their organizations were at least 75% prepared rose from 15% in November  to 29% in January  to 33% in May’s polling  while 9% percent of respondents in May’s webinar considered their organizations fully ready to comply  an uptick from 7% in January and 3% in November 2023.The percentage who perceive their organizations as “Not at all ready” to comply decreased from 38% in November to 16% in May.CT Corporation offers a suite of BOI solutions to help businesses of all sizes meet their ongoing reporting obligations. Its Beneficial Ownership Platform securely stores and retains BOI filing information  making both multiple entity filings and amendments much less time-consuming. CT Corporation is now an authorized API filing participant for the U.S Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). The CT technology connects directly to FinCEN via the API  enabling the upload of thousands of filings in real time to FinCEN in a compliant  secure manner.For more information on navigating the BOI reporting requirements  visit “Beneficial Ownership Information Compliance from CT Corporation.”About Wolters KluwerWolters Kluwer (EURONEXT: WKL) is a global leader in information  software solutions and services for professionals in healthcare; tax and accounting; financial and corporate compliance; legal and regulatory; corporate performance and ESG.

The Declaration of Withdrawal must contain at least the following information: (i) the personal data (name  surname  place and date of birth in the case of a natural person; company name and registered office in the case of a legal entity)  the tax code (if attributed)  the domicile (and  where possible  a telephone number and/or e-mail address) of the withdrawing shareholder for communications pertaining to the Right of Withdrawal; (ii) the number of Exprivia shares for which the Right of Withdrawal is exercised; (iii) the details and coordinates of the current account of the withdrawing shareholder to which the Liquidation Value of the shares themselves is to be credited; and (iv) the indication of the intermediary with which the account in which the shares for which the Right of Withdrawal is exercised are registered  with the details of the aforementioned account. To this end  shareholders may also use the facsimile of Declaration of Withdrawal made available by Exprivia  on its website  at www.exprivia.it  section ""Corporate Governance -> Shareholders' Meetings -> Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting of April 30  2024."" It should be recalled that  pursuant to Article 43  first paragraph  of the Single Provision on post-trading adopted by Consob and the Bank of Italy on August 13  2018 (the ""Single Provision"")  the withdrawing shareholder - in addition to sending Exprivia the Declaration of Withdrawal in the manner and within the terms indicated above - must request  pursuant to Art. 41 of the Unified Provision  to the intermediary with which the account in which the Exprivia shares for which the Right of Withdrawal is being exercised are registered  to send Exprivia the appropriate communication (the ""Intermediary Communication"") certifying: (i) the uninterrupted ownership  in the hands of the withdrawing shareholder  of the shares with respect to which the Right of Withdrawal is exercised  from the date of the Meeting until the date of exercise of the Right of Withdrawal itself; and (ii) the absence of lien or other encumbrance on the shares in relation to which the Right of Withdrawal is exercised (if this is not the case  the withdrawing shareholder must provide the Company  as a condition for the admissibility of the Declaration of Withdrawal  with a special statement made by the pledgee or by the party in whose favor there is another lien on the shares  by which such party gives its irrevocable and unconditional consent to carry out the liquidation of the shares subject to the Right of Withdrawal in accordance with the instructions of the withdrawing shareholder). Statements of Withdrawal sent after the deadline of May 22  2024 and/or lacking the above information required and/or for which the necessary Notice from the Intermediary is not received in due time will have no 2PRESS RELEASE effect and  therefore  will not be taken into consideration by Exprivia. Please note that  pursuant to Article 43  second paragraph  of the Single Provision  the shares subject to the Intermediary's Communication will be made unavailable. Therefore  the shares for which the Right of Withdrawal has been legitimately exercised may not be sold or otherwise constitute the subject of acts of disposition by the withdrawing shareholder. Please note that the Right of Withdrawal  legitimately exercised  will be effective subject to the execution of the deed of Merger. In the event that one or more shareholders should exercise the Right of Withdrawal  the liquidation proceedings will be conducted in accordance with Article 2437-quater of the Civil Code  pursuant to which Exprivia's directors will first offer the shares subject to withdrawal as an option to all other shareholders  in proportion to the number of shares held by them. Exprivia shareholders who exercise their option rights  provided they make a simultaneous request  will also have a right of first refusal to purchase the unopted shares. The terms of the option and pre-emption offer  as well as any further information on the liquidation process  will be disclosed in the manner prescribed by current regulations. 3",neutral,0.03,0.88,0.09,negative,0.06,0.31,0.64,True,English,"['withdrawal period', 'Exprivia S', 'Registration', 'resolution', 'Abaco3', 'start', 'BARI COMPANIES REGISTER START', 'Exprivia S.p.A.', 'Abaco3 S.p.A.', 'Italian Stock Exchange', 'list voting mechanism', 'Via Adriano Olivetti', 'MERGE EXPRIVIA INTO', 'Euronext Milan market', 'Certified Electronic Mail', 'Italian Civil Code', ""extraordinary shareholders' meeting"", 'PRESS RELEASE REGISTRATION', 'tax code', 'XPR.MI', '2437- quinquies', 'Art. 83-sexies', 'liquidation value', 'six hundred', 'seventy-two cents', 'arithmetic mean', 'closing prices', 'six months', '15 calendar days', 'sealed envelope', 'Investor Relator', 'orderly conduct', 'following information', 'personal data', 'natural person', 'legal entity', 'withdrawing shareholder', 'following address', 'telephone number', 'mail address', 'Exprivia shares', 'merger project', 'current account', 'same date', 'WITHDRAWAL PERIOD', 'WITHDRAWAL FOLLOWING', 'company name', 'registered letter', 'Merger resolution', 'incorporation', 'right', 'May', 'April', 'minutes', 'approval', 'Articles', 'paragraph', 'METHODS', 'TERMS', 'ENTRY', 'part', '2437-quinquies', 'elimination', 'exclusion', 'listing', 'TUF', 'favor', 'entitlement', 'opening', 'proceedings', 'relation', 'Article 2437', 'publication', 'Notice', 'March', 'today', 'Declaration', 'Molfetta', 'PEC', 'purpose', 'procedure', 'exercise', 'prejudice', 'need', 'law', 'surname', 'place', 'birth', 'case', 'office', 'domicile', 'communications', 'details', 'coordinates', 'indication', 'intermediary', '00']",2024-05-10,2024-05-11,marketscreener.com

Total revenue in the quarter declined by 3.9%  reflecting the impact of strategic asset disposals completed in the second half of 2023  the net effect of which were broadly neutral as the proceeds were used to repay higher cost debt and strengthen the Balance Sheet. Our business continues to be supported by highly recurring cashflows and strong rent collections  which remain in excess of 99% and in line with 2023.The Company continues to maintain its focus on prudent balance sheet and capital management. LTV1 at 31 March 2024 was 44.7% (31 December 2023: 44.3%) and well within our banking covenants and Irish REIT regime rules. The increase in LTV was primarily driven by the payment of the Company’s final 2023 dividend during the period.I-RES will hold its 2024 AGM today at 11:30am at the Herbert Park Hotel  Ballsbridge  Dublin 4 D04 R2T2.Eddie Byrne  CEO of I-RES  commented:“I-RES has continued its momentum from 2023 into the first quarter of 2024  delivering another strong operational performance. Occupancy rates across our portfolio continue to be in excess of 99%  demonstrating the high-quality nature of our assets in attractive locations  and driven by our market leading digital operating platform. We continue to believe the medium-term outlook for both the PRS sector in Ireland and the I-RES portfolio remains positive  underpinned by strong levels of demand which far outstrip supply. We are continuing to conduct a thorough and comprehensive Strategic Review at pace  which is attempting to unlock the inherent value contained with the I-RES operating platform and maximise value for shareholders”.1 LTV is based on portfolio valuation as at 31 December 2023ENDFor further information please contact:For Investor Relations at Irish Residential Properties REIT plc:Luke Ferriter  Investor Relations investors@iresreit.ie Tel: +353 (0) 1 563 4000Eddie Byrne  Chief Executive Officer Tel: +353 (0) 1 557 0974For Media Queries:Padraig McKeon  I-RES PR and Communications Tel: + 353 (0) 87 231 2632Jonathan Neilan  FTI Consulting ires@fticonsulting.com Tel: +353 (0) 86 231 4135About Irish Residential Properties REIT plcIrish Residential Properties REIT plc (“I-RES”) is a growth oriented Real Estate Investment Trust providing quality professionally managed homes in sustainable communities in Ireland.

40769,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/05/10/2879376/0/en/Report-on-Payments-to-Governments.html,Report on Payments to Governments,Kenmare Resources plc(“Kenmare” or “the Company” or “the Group”)    10 May 2024    Report on Payments to Governments    Kenmare Resources plc (LSE:KMR ......,"Kenmare Resources plc(“Kenmare” or “the Company” or “the Group”)10 May 2024Report on Payments to GovernmentsKenmare Resources plc (LSE:KMR  ISE:KMR)  one of the leading global producers of titanium minerals and zircon  which operates the Moma Titanium Minerals Mine (the ""Mine"" or ""Moma"") in northern Mozambique  announces the publication of its Report on Payments to Governments.IntroductionThis report details payments to governments made by Kenmare Resources plc (the “Company”) and its subsidiary undertakings (the “Group”) for the financial year ended 31 December 2023.This report has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Part 2A of the Transparency (Directive 2004/109/EC) Regulations  2007 (as amended) (“Part 2A”)  Part 26 of the Companies Act 2014 (“Part 26”) and rule DTR 4.3A of the UK Financial Conduct Authority’s Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules (“DTR 4.3A”). Part 2A and Part 26 enact in Ireland domestic rules in line with Directive 2013/34/EU (the “EU Accounting Directive (2013)”) and apply to large Irish incorporated companies  like the Company  that are involved in the exploration  discovery  development  and extraction of minerals. DTR 4.3A imposes equivalent requirements on issuers  like the Company  admitted to trading on the London Stock Exchange that are similarly involved in the exploration  development and extraction of minerals.About Kenmare Resources plcKenmare Resources plc is an Irish incorporated company with a premium listing on the London Stock Exchange and a secondary listing on Euronext Dublin. Kenmare operates the Moma Titanium Minerals Mine (the “Moma Mine”)  which is located on the northern coast of Mozambique. Moma is one of the world’s largest producers of minerals sands products  accounting for production of approximately 7% of global titanium feedstocks and supplying to customers operating in over 15 countries. The Group’s products are key raw materials  ultimately consumed in everyday quality-of-life products such as paints  plastics  and ceramic tiles.The Group consists of the parent company (Kenmare Resources plc) and its subsidiary undertakings. The mining operations at the Moma Mine are carried out by the Mozambique branch of Kenmare Moma Mining (Mauritius) Limited (“KMML”) and downstream processing is undertaken by the Mozambique branch of Kenmare Moma Processing (Mauritius) Limited (“KMPL”)  both of which are wholly-owned subsidiary undertakings of the Company. KMML and KMPL account for 100% of the Group’s turnover and 99% of the Group’s total assets. Therefore  all revenues and operating costs of the Group’s mining and processing operations are recorded by KMML and KMPL within the same tax jurisdiction  namely Mozambique.The parent company  Kenmare Resources plc  conducts no direct exploration or mining activities. The Group’s corporate costs are recorded by the parent company.Scope of reportDisclosure of payments to Governments is required in respect of payments arising from the exploration  discovery  development and extraction of minerals; the payments included within this report therefore relate to the Group’s mining and processing activities at the Moma Mine in Mozambique.Groups are required to prepare a consolidated report disclosing payments made by the parent company and its subsidiary undertakings. Accordingly  this report reflects payments made by the Group companies conducting mining and processing activities  namely KMML and KMPL. The Group owns 100% of these entities and the amounts reflect 100% of the payments made by these subsidiary undertakings.For a broader discussion of the Group’s payments to governments and its contribution to its host communities  please see the Group’s 2023 Sustainability Report  available on the Company’s website at www.kenmareresources.com/investors/reports-and-presentationsPaymentsThe payments disclosed in this report are on a cash basis.The payments made to Governments are required to be analysed into the following categories:Production entitlements - this category includes the host Government’s share of production  which is usually outlined in a production sharing agreement. In 2023  the Group did not make relevant payments in this category.Taxes - this category includes taxes paid to governments on income  profits or production arising from the Group’s exploration  discovery  development and extraction of minerals. Taxes levied on consumption such as value added taxes  personal income taxes and sales taxes are excluded. KMML is subject to a corporation tax rate of 35% of the taxable profits of its Mozambique branch. Taxable profits of the branch are calculated by reference to the cash costs of producing Heavy Mineral Concentrate (“HMC”) net of allowable tax deductions and increased by a defined margin.KMML’s Mozambique branch produces one product from its mining activities  namely HMC. HMC is sold to KMPL  which processes it into finished products (ilmenite  zircon  rutile and mineral sands concentrate)  which are exported worldwide to third party customers. The cash costs of mining include the costs of mine face preparation  dredging and dry mining operations  Wet Concentrator Plant operations  rehabilitation and support services.The margin applied to the cash costs of mining is stipulated in the Mineral Licensing Contract  dated 21 January 2002. The contract is between KMML and the Ministry of Mineral Resources and Energy (MIREME) of the Republic of Mozambique  acting for and on behalf of the Government of the Republic of Mozambique  which details the terms and conditions for the exploration  development and production of heavy minerals in the areas of Moma  Congolone and Quinga. The margin is determined by dividing the prices for sale of finished products to third party customers earned by KMPL in the year by the prices earned in the prior year  adjusted for inflation and applying this factor to the prior year margin. For the fiscal year ending 31 December 2023 the margin was 58.8%.KMPL has the benefit of operating within an Industrial Free Zone (“IFZ”) and as an IFZ company  it is exempt from corporation tax.Royalties – this category includes payments to a Government for the rights to extract minerals or other materials. Typically amounts are levied based on production levels or revenues. KMML is subject to a mining royalty of 3% based on HMC sold to KMPL. The royalty is calculated by multiplying the cash costs of producing HMC  plus the margin as detailed above  by 3%.KMPL is subject to a revenue royalty of 1% on revenue recognised.Dividends - this category includes dividend payments other than dividends paid to a Government as an ordinary shareholder of the Company or one of its subsidiary undertakings. In 2023  the Group did not make relevant payments in this category.Bonuses - this category includes bonuses paid to a Government for and in consideration of signature  discovery  production  awards  grants and transfers of extraction rights and production bonuses. In 2023  the Group did not make relevant payments in this category.Fees – this category includes licence fees  rental fees  entry fees and other considerations for mining licences or concessions.Infrastructure improvements – this category includes payments to Governments for infrastructure other than in circumstances where the infrastructure is expected to be primarily dedicated to operational activities throughout its useful life. Payments that form part of the Group’s social investment activities (which are primarily organised and administered by Kenmare Moma Development Association) are excluded. Such payments would include contributions in respect of local schools  healthcare or community facilities  or improvements to the general environment of local communities.Government“Government” means any national  regional or local authority of a country  and includes a department  agency or undertaking that is a subsidiary undertaking where the authority is the parent undertaking.All payments referred to in this report are made to the Government of Mozambique or its agencies; in particular  they are made to Autoridade Tributária Unidade dos Grandes Contribuintes–Nampula  a department of the Mozambican tax authority.Analysis by project/entityAn analysis of payments by project is required where payments are attributable to specific projects. Projects are defined as operational activities which are governed by a single contract  licence  lease  concession or similar legal agreement  and form the basis for payment liabilities with a government. Where agreements are substantially interconnected in operating and geographical terms  with substantially similar terms  those agreements should be treated as a single project. Payments may be disclosed at an entity level where payments are made in respect of obligations imposed at that entity level rather than at a project level. Payments below are disclosed at the entity level for KMML and KMPL  which between them operate the Moma Mine  which is treated as one project for purposes of this Report.MaterialityUnder Part 2A and Part 26  a payment need not be disclosed if it is a single payment of less than the equivalent of €100 000 or a series of related payments in a single year whose total is less than the equivalent of €100 000. Under DTR 4.3A  a payment need not be disclosed if it is a single payment of less than the equivalent of £86 000 or a series of related payments in a single year whose total is less than the equivalent of £86 000.Currency and roundingAll monetary amounts in this report refer to United States dollars unless otherwise indicated. The amounts shown in this report have been rounded to the nearest $1 000.Payments to Governments – 2023Production entitlements Taxes Royalties Dividends Bonuses Fees Infrastructure improvements Total $’000 $’000 $’000 $’000 $’000 $’000 $’000 $’000 Country summary Government of Mozambique - 19 798 10 259 - - 504 - 30 561 Total - 19 798 10 259 - - 504 - 30 561 Entity report KMML - 19 798 5 674 - - 504 - 25 976 KMPL - - 4 585 - - - - 4 585 Total - 19 798 10 259 - - 504 - 30 561This report for Kenmare Resources plc (registered number 37550) was approved by the Directors of the Company on 9 May 2024 and signed on their behalf byMichael Carvill Tom Hickey Director DirectorFor further information  please contact:Kenmare Resources plcJeremy Dibb / Katharine Sutton / Michael StarkeInvestor Relationsir@kenmareresouces.comTel: +353 1 671 0411Mob: +353 87 943 0367 / +353 87 663 0875Murray (PR advisor)Paul O’Kanepokane@murraygroup.ieTel: +353 1 498 0300Mob: +353 86 609 0221About Kenmare ResourcesKenmare Resources plc is one of the world's largest producers of mineral sands products.
