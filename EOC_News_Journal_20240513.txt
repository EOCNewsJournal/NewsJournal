This new European patent provides intellectual property (IP) protection for masitinib in this indication until October 2036 and adds to IP coverage already granted in the USA (US 10045978B2) and Japan (JP 6801892B2).Masitinib is positioned as a treatment of severely symptomatic systemic mastocytosis patients  including the subvariants of indolent and smoldering systemic mastocytosis  who are unresponsive to optimal symptomatic treatment. More specifically  this patent provides protection of masitinib and related compounds for treatment of systemic mastocytosis in a patient population presenting with at least two severe mast cell mediator release associated symptoms  selected from pruritus  flushes or depression (Hamilton rating scale). This patient population is consistent with results from masitinib study AB06006 [1] and also the on-going clinical development program of masitinib in severe systemic mastocytosis.Masitinib has also received orphan drug designation for mastocytosis from both the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This orphan drug designation provides 10 and 7 years of market exclusivity in Europe and the United States respectively  subsequent to product approval.The same medical use patent strategy had been successfully pursued in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis  with patent granted worldwide until 2037  and is being pursued in other indications such as multiple sclerosis  Alzheimer’s disease for protection until 2041  and in prostate cancer until 2042.Reference[1] Lortholary O  Chandesris MO  Bulai Livideanu C  et al. Masitinib for treatment of severely symptomatic indolent systemic mastocytosis: a randomised  placebo-controlled  phase 3 study. Lancet. 2017;389(10069):612-620.About Indolent Systemic MastocytosisIndolent systemic mastocytosis (ISM) is a hematological disease characterized by an abnormal number and activation of mast cells in the bone marrow and other organs. The disease if characterized by multiple symptoms that are disabling and can in some cases be life-threatening. Symptoms associated ISM are predominantly associated with neurological disorders (depression  fatigue  cognitive impairment  headache)  skin disorders (pruritus  skin lesions)  flushing and gastro-intestinal disorders. ISM affects approximately 40 000 people in Europe and 25 000 in the USA. There is currently a high unmet medical need in this population.About masitinibMasitinib is a orally administered tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets mast cells and macrophages  important cells for immunity  through inhibiting a limited number of kinases. Based on its unique mechanism of action  masitinib can be developed in a large number of conditions in oncology  in inflammatory diseases  and in certain diseases of the central nervous system. In oncology due to its immunotherapy effect  masitinib can have an effect on survival  alone or in combination with chemotherapy. Through its activity on mast cells and microglia and consequently the inhibition of the activation of the inflammatory process  masitinib can have an effect on the symptoms associated with some inflammatory and central nervous system diseases and the degeneration of these diseases.About AB ScienceFounded in 2001  AB Science is a pharmaceutical company specializing in the research  development and commercialization of protein kinase inhibitors (PKIs)  a class of targeted proteins whose action are key in signaling pathways within cells. Our programs target only diseases with high unmet medical needs  often lethal with short term survival or rare or refractory to previous line of treatment.AB Science has developed a proprietary portfolio of molecules and the Company’s lead compound  masitinib  has already been registered for veterinary medicine and is developed in human medicine in oncology  neurological diseases  inflammatory diseases and viral diseases. The company is headquartered in Paris  France  and listed on Euronext Paris (ticker: AB).Further information is available on AB Science’s website: www.ab-science.com.Forward-looking Statements - AB ScienceThis press release contains forward-looking statements.
