Authorities are also testing out extended trading hours of the domestic won market  ahead of its official extension due in July.Such measures would be “nice-to-have but not necessarily a deal breaker since other markets such as China/Malaysia have limited liquid extended trading hours ” the Goldman analysts wrote.Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek©2024 Bloomberg L.P.,neutral,0.11,0.88,0.01,neutral,0.08,0.84,0.09,True,English,"['Major Bond Index', 'South Korea', 'Goldman', 'important remaining key issue', 'local interbank currency market', 'Goldman Sachs Group Inc', 'liquid extended trading hours', 'key global bond index', 'World Government Bond Index', 'Local media reports', 'domestic won market', 'Euroclear Bank SA', 'Korean sovereign securities', '2024 Bloomberg L.P.', 'foreign investors’ access', 'global investors', 'government debt', 'Goldman analysts', 'foreign capital', 'Danny Suwanapruti', 'next review', '$60 billion worth', 'watch list', 'Asian country', 'official extension', 'Such measures', 'deal breaker', 'other markets', 'Bloomberg Businessweek', 'South Korea', 'FTSE Russell', 'September', 'breakthrough', 'Clearstream', 'June', 'nation', 'inclusion', 'note', 'move', 'inflows', 'efforts', 'Authorities', 'July', 'China', 'Malaysia']",2024-05-15,2024-05-16,finance.yahoo.com

Securities admitted to trading on the ISM are not admitted to the Official List of the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the ""FCA"").

As described herein  the terms of the Securities also provide for circumstances under which the Issuer shall be restricted from making an interest payment (in whole or in part) on the Securities on an Interest Payment Date  and the interest payable in respect of any such Interest Payment Date shall be deemed cancelled (in whole or in part) and therefore not due and payable. Interest will only be due and payable on an Interest Payment Date to the extent it is not cancelled or deemed cancelled in accordance with the terms of the Securities and as further described herein. Any interest cancelled or deemed cancelled (in each case  in whole or in part) in accordance with the terms of the Securities and as further described herein shall not be due and shall not accumulate or be payable at any time thereafter  and holders of the Securities shall have no rights thereto or to receive any additional interest or compensation as a result of such cancellation or deemed cancellation.The Securities are perpetual and have no fixed maturity or fixed redemption date.

As described herein  we may  at our option  redeem the Securities  in whole but not in part  on (i) any day falling in the period commencing on (and including) June 15  2030 and ending on (and including) the first Reset Date or (ii) any day falling in the period commencing on (and including) the date that is six months before any subsequent Reset Date and ending on (and including) such Reset Date at 100% of their principal amount  together with any accrued but unpaid interest (which excludes any interest cancelled or deemed cancelled as described herein) to (but excluding) the date fixed for redemption.

Additionally  if at any time from the fifth anniversary of the Issue Date (unless otherwise permitted by the PRA (as defined herein))  the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Securities is 25% or less of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities originally issued  we may redeem all (but not some only) of the outstanding Securities at a redemption price equal to 100% of their principal amount  together with any accrued but unpaid interest (which excludes any interest cancelled or deemed cancelled as described herein) to (but excluding) the date fixed for redemption. Following the occurrence of such changes in certain U.K. regulatory capital requirements or upon the occurrence of certain tax events  we may also  at our option either substitute all (but not some only) of the Securities for  or vary the terms of the Securities so that they remain or  as appropriate  become  Compliant Securities (as defined herein).

Each potential investor in the Securities must determine the suitability of that investment in light of its own circumstances. In particular  each potential investor should: have sufficient knowledge and experience to make a meaningful evaluation of the Securities  the merits and risk of investing in the Securities and the information contained or incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus; have access to  and knowledge of  appropriate analytical tools to evaluate  in the context of its particular financial situation  an investment in the Securities and the impact such investment will have on its overall investment portfolio; have sufficient financial resources and liquidity to bear all of the risks of an investment in the Securities or where the currency for principal or interest payments is different from the currency in which such investor's financial activities are principally denominated; understand thoroughly the terms of the Securities  such as the provisions governing an Automatic Conversion (including  in particular  the circumstances under which a Capital Adequacy Trigger Event may occur) and the situations in which interest payments may be cancelled or deemed cancelled and be familiar with the resolution regime applicable to the Group  including the possibility that the Securities may become subject to write-down or conversion if the resolution powers are exercised; be able to evaluate (either alone or with the help of a financial adviser) possible scenarios for economic  interest rate and other factors that may affect its investment and its ability to bear the applicable risks; and understand the accounting  legal  regulatory and tax implications of a purchase  and the holding and disposal of an investment in the Securities. The investment activities of certain investors are subject to legal investment laws and regulations  or review or regulation by certain authorities. Each potential investor should consult its legal advisers to determine whether and to what extent: (i) the Securities are legal investments for it; (ii) the Securities can be used as collateral for various types of borrowing; and (iii) other restrictions apply to its purchase or pledge of the Securities. Financial institutions should consult their legal advisors or the appropriate regulators to determine the appropriate treatment of the Securities under any applicable risk-based capital or similar rules. Prior to making an investment decision  potential investors should consider carefully  in light of their own financial circumstances and investment objectives  all the information included and incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus. S-1PROHIBITION ON MARKETING AND SALES TO RETAIL INVESTORS The Securities are complex financial instruments and are not a suitable or appropriate investment for all investors  especially retail investors. In some jurisdictions  regulatory authorities have adopted or published laws  regulations or guidance with respect to the offer or sale of securities such as the Securities. Potential investors in the Securities should inform themselves of  and comply with  any applicable laws  regulations or regulatory guidance with respect to any resale of the Securities (or any beneficial interests therein). (a) In the U.K.  the COBS requires  in summary  that the Securities should not be offered or sold to retail clients (as defined in COBS 3.4 and each a ""retail client"") in the U.K. Certain of the underwriters are required to comply with the COBS. By purchasing  or making or accepting an offer to purchase  any Securities (or a beneficial interest in such Securities) from the Issuer and/or the underwriters  each prospective investor represents  warrants  agrees with and undertakes to the Issuer and each of the underwriters that: it is not a retail client in the U.K.; and it will not sell or offer the Securities (or any beneficial interest therein) to retail clients in the U.K. or communicate (including the distribution of this prospectus supplement or the accompanying prospectus) or approve an invitation or inducement to participate in  acquire or underwrite the Securities (or any beneficial interests therein) where that invitation or inducement is addressed to or disseminated in such a way that it is likely to be received by a retail client in the U.K. In selling or offering the Securities or making or approving communications relating to the Securities  prospective investors may not rely on the limited exemptions set out in the COBS. The obligations in paragraph 2 above are in addition to the need to comply at all times with all other applicable laws  regulations and regulatory guidance (whether inside or outside the EEA or the U.K.) relating to the promotion  offering  distribution and/or sale of the Securities (or any beneficial interests therein)  whether or not specifically mentioned in this prospectus supplement or the accompanying prospectus  including (without limitation) any requirements under MiFID II or the U.K. FCA Handbook as to determining the appropriateness and/or suitability of an investment in the Securities (or any beneficial interests therein) for investors in any relevant jurisdiction. Where acting as agent on behalf of a disclosed or undisclosed client when purchasing  or making or accepting an offer to purchase  any Securities (or any beneficial interests therein) from the Issuer and/ or the underwriters the foregoing representations  warranties  agreements and undertakings will be given by and be binding upon both the agent and its underlying client. IMPORTANT-PRIIPs REGULATION / PROHIBITION OF SALES TO EEA RETAIL INVESTORS. The Securities are not intended to be offered  sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered  sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes  a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the Insurance Distribution Directive  where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II. Consequently  no key information document required by the PRIIPs Regulation for offering or selling the Securities or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Securities or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation. U.K. MIFIR PRODUCT GOVERNANCE / PROFESSIONAL INVESTORS AND ECPS ONLY TARGET MARKET-Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer's product approval process  the target market assessment in respect of the Securities has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Securities is only eligible counterparties  as defined in COBS  and professional clients  as defined in U.K. MiFIR; S-2",neutral,0.02,0.97,0.01,negative,0.02,0.28,0.7,True,English,"['Prospectus Supplement', 'Barclays', 'Publication', '8.500% Fixed Rate Resetting Perpetual Subordinated Contingent Convertible Securities', 'U.K. Financial Conduct Authority', 'applicable Mid-Market Swap Rate', 'London Stock Exchange plc', 'relevant Reset Determination Date', 'U.K. MiFIR', 'fifth (5th) anniversary', 'three decimal places', 'initial interest rate', '0,000 aggregate principal amount', 'first Reset Date', 'subordinated obligations', 'Interest Payment Date', 'International Securities Market', 'perpetual securities', 'fixed maturity', 'Financial Services', 'quarterly rate', 'Barclays PLC', 'Issue Date', 'redemption date', 'Calculation Agent', 'market convention', 'regulated market', 'MiFID II', 'professional investors', 'Official List', 'domestic law', 'United Kingdom', 'European Union', 'absolute discretion', 'direct, unsecured', 'minimum denominations', 'integral multiples', 'additional interest', 'Prospectus Supplement', 'accompanying prospectus', 'Markets Act', 'sole discretion', 'The Securities', 'The ISM', 'The LSE', 'Withdrawal Act', 'Part VI', 'Issuer', 'December', 'annum', 'next', 'sum', 'conditions', 'arrear', 'March', 'June', 'September', 'year', 'purposes', 'FCA', 'contents', 'particulars', 'FSMA', 'Regulation', 'virtue', 'terms', 'times', 'reason', 'circumstances', 'respect', 'extent', 'accordance', 'case', 'holders', 'rights', 'compensation', 'result', 'cancellation', 'fact', 'winding-up', 'administration', 'preference', 'form', 'excess', 'option', 'day', 'period', '25']",2024-05-15,2024-05-16,marketscreener.com

Annual General Meeting 2024 Legal - 24233450.2Letter from the Chairman EPE Special Opportunities Limited (a company incorporated in Bermuda with registered number 53954  with registered office: Clarendon House  2 Church Street  Hamilton HM11  Bermuda) Directors: Business Address: C L Spears (Non-executive Chairman) Gaspe House H Bestwick (Non-executive Director) 66-72 Esplanade M M Gray (Non-executive Director) St Helier D R Pirouet (Non-executive Director) Jersey JE1 2LH 15 May 2024 Dear Shareholders  Annual General Meeting 1. Introduction Please find enclosed notice of the forthcoming Annual General Meeting of the Company to be held at 15.30pm (Jersey time) on 12 June 2024 at Gaspe House  66-72 Esplanade  St Helier  Jersey  JE1 2LH. 2. Shareholder Questions Please note that the Annual General Meeting will be restricted to its formal business only. However  the Board recognises that the Annual General Meeting represents an opportunity to engage with Shareholders and provides a forum that enables Shareholders to ask questions of the Board. In light of this  Shareholders are invited to submit their questions by email to eso@langhamhall.com by 15.30pm (Jersey time) on 11 June 2024. Such questions will be considered by the Board  and the Company will respond to any relevant questions that are received. 3. Duration of the Company The Board keeps the duration of the Company under periodic review and the position was last brought to Shareholders' attention at the annual general meeting on 30 July 2019. It was then resolved that the Shareholders be asked to vote on an ordinary resolution to extend the existence of the Company until 31 December 2025. The Board believes that the best value for the current investments can be achieved by continuing to hold them for the medium-to-long term. This would give their respective management teams and the Investment Advisor the opportunity to enhance the value of the assets through the implementation of organic and acquisition-led growth strategies. In addition  the Company continues to investigate a pipeline of potential new investments made available by the favourable dynamics within lower mid-market private equity  wherein a large universe of companies and the relatively low availability of financing can create opportunities to acquire high quality assets at attractive entry valuations. The Board believes that the Company's ability to take advantage of such opportunities would be best served by extending the life of the Company. 2 Legal - 24233450.2The Board believes that  in combination  the continued development of the existing investments over the medium-to-long term and the potential for strong value creation in new investments acquired at attractive pricing creates an opportunity for significant growth in the Company's net asset value. The Board is therefore proposing that Shareholders be asked to vote on an ordinary resolution to continue the life of the Company until 31 December 2030. If such continuation resolution is passed  it is proposed that the next continuation resolution be put to the annual general meeting of the Company in 2030. If such continuation resolution is not passed  the Board will submit alternative proposals for a re-organisation of the Company to Shareholders by no later than 31 January 2025. 4. Resolutions: general The resolutions described below will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting: an ordinary resolution adopting the audited accounts of the Company for the year ended 31 January 2024 (together with the Directors' and Auditor's reports thereon); an ordinary resolution re-appointing PricewaterhouseCoopers CI LLP as Auditors of the Company; an ordinary resolution authorising the Directors to determine PricewaterhouseCoopers CILLP's remuneration; an ordinary resolution to re-appoint Clive Spears as a Director of the Company; an ordinary resolution authorising the Company to complete share and debt purchases where the aggregate consideration in the 12 months preceding the record date for the proposed purchase will exceed 10 per cent. of the mean market capitalisation of all of the Company's equitable securities listed on any stock exchange; and an ordinary resolution to continue the life of the Company until 31 December 2030. The quorum for the Annual General Meeting is either two persons entitled to attend and to vote on the business to be transacted  each being a Shareholder or a proxy for a Shareholder or a duly authorised representative of a corporation which is a Shareholder or one person entitled to attend and to vote on the business to be transacted  being a Shareholder holding not less than one-tenth of the nominal issued share capital of the Company to which the voting rights are attached and being present in person (or  being a corporation  by representative) or by proxy. On a show of hands  each holder who is present in person or (being a corporation) by a duly authorised representative has one vote. On a poll  each holder who is present in person or by proxy or (being a corporation) by a duly authorised representative has one vote for every ordinary share held. In order to be passed  the ordinary resolutions must be passed by a majority of not less than half of such Shareholders as  being entitled so to do  vote in person (or  being a corporation  by representative) or by proxy at the Annual General Meeting. The Company Board  pursuant to the Company's bye-laws  specifies that only those members registered in the register of members of the Company as at 15.30pm (Jersey time) on 10 June 2024 (or in the event that the meeting is adjourned  on the register of members not later than 15.30pm (Jersey time) two business days prior to the time of any adjournment meeting) shall be entitled to attend or vote at the meeting in respect of the ordinary shares registered in their name at that time. Changes to entries on the register of members of the Company after 15.30pm (Jersey time) on 10 June 2024 (or  in the event that the meeting is adjourned  on the register of members later than 15.30pm (Jersey time) two business days prior to the time of any adjourned meeting) shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend or vote at the meeting. 3 Legal - 24233450.25.

To allow effective constitution of the Annual General Meeting  if it is apparent to the chairman of the meeting that no shareholders will be present in person or by proxy  other than by proxy in the chairman of the meeting's favour  then the chairman of the meeting may appoint a substitute to act as proxy in his/her stead for any shareholder  provided that such substitute proxy shall vote on the same basis as the chairman of the meeting.

To be entitled to attend and vote at the Annual General Meeting (and for the purpose of the determination by the Company of the votes they may cast)  shareholders must be registered in the register of members of the Company at 15.30pm (Jersey time) on 10 June 2024 or  in the event of any adjournment  at 15.30pm (Jersey time) on the date which is two days before the time of the adjourned meeting. Changes to entries on the register of shareholders after the relevant deadline shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend and vote at the Annual General Meeting. CREST members CREST members who wish to instruct Computershare by utilising the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so for the Annual General Meeting (and any adjournments thereof) by utilising the procedures described in the CREST Manual. CREST personal members or other CREST sponsored members  and those CREST members who have appointed a voting service provider(s) should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service providers  who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf. In order for an instruction made by means of CREST to be valid  the appropriate CREST Proxy Instruction must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited's specifications and must contain the information required for such instructions  as described in the CREST Manual. The message must be transmitted so as to be received by the Registrar  by the latest time for receipt of instructions specified in this notice of Annual General Meeting. For this purpose  the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST Applications Host) from which the issuer's agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. CREST members and  where applicable  their CREST sponsors or voting service providers should note that Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited does not make available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages.

As described in this prospectus supplement  the terms of the Securities provide that interest on the Securities will be due and payable only at the sole discretion of the Issuer  and the Issuer shall have sole and absolute discretion at all times and for any reason to cancel (in whole or in part) any interest payment that would otherwise be payable on any Interest Payment Date. As described herein  the terms of the Securities also provide for circumstances under which the Issuer shall be restricted from making an interest payment (in whole or in part) on the Securities on an Interest Payment Date  and the interest payable in respect of any such Interest Payment Date shall be deemed cancelled (in whole or in part) and therefore not due and payable. Interest will only be due and payable on an Interest Payment Date to the extent it is not cancelled or deemed cancelled in accordance with the terms of the Securities and as further described herein. Any interest cancelled or deemed cancelled (in each case  in whole or in part) in accordance with the terms of the Securities and as further described herein shall not be due and shall not accumulate or be payable at any time thereafter  and holders of the Securities shall have no rights thereto or to receive any additional interest or compensation as a result of such cancellation or deemed cancellation.The Securities are perpetual and have no fixed maturity or fixed redemption date.

The Securities will be in registered form in minimum denominations of £200 000 and in integral multiples of £1 000 in excess thereof. As described herein  we may  at our option  redeem the Securities  in whole but not in part  on (i) any day falling in the period commencing on (and including) June 15  2030 and ending on (and including) the first Reset Date or (ii) any day falling in the period commencing on (and including) the date that is six months before any subsequent Reset Date and ending on (and including) such Reset Date at 100% of their principal amount  together with any accrued but unpaid interest (which excludes any interest cancelled or deemed cancelled as described herein) to (but excluding) the date fixed for redemption. As described herein  we may also  at our option  redeem the Securities  in whole but not in part  at any time in the event of a change in certain U.K. regulatory capital requirements or upon the occurrence of certain tax events as described herein at 100% of their principal amount  together with any accrued but unpaid interest (which excludes any interest cancelled or deemed cancelled as described herein) to (but excluding) the date fixed for redemption. Additionally  if at any time from the fifth anniversary of the Issue Date (unless otherwise permitted by the PRA (as defined herein))  the outstanding aggregate principal amount of the Securities is 25% or less of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities originally issued  we may redeem all (but not some only) of the outstanding Securities at a redemption price equal to 100% of their principal amount  together with any accrued but unpaid interest (which excludes any interest cancelled or deemed cancelled as described herein) to (but excluding) the date fixed for redemption. Following the occurrence of such changes in certain U.K. regulatory capital requirements or upon the occurrence of certain tax events  we may also  at our option either substitute all (but not some only) of the Securities for  or vary the terms of the Securities so that they remain or  as appropriate  become  Compliant Securities (as defined herein). If a Capital Adequacy Trigger Event (as defined herein) occurs  then an Automatic Conversion (as defined herein) will occur on the Conversion Date (as defined herein)  at which point all of the Issuer's obligations under the Securities (other than certain Issuer obligations in connection with the Conversion Shares Offer (as defined herein)  if any  which are referred to herein as the CSO Obligations) shall be irrevocably and automatically released in consideration of the Issuer's issuance of the Conversion Shares (as defined herein) to the Conversion Shares Depository (as defined herein) (or other relevant recipient as described herein)  and under no circumstances shall such released obligations be reinstated. The Conversion Shares shall initially be registered in the name of the Conversion Shares Depository (which shall hold the Conversion Shares on behalf of the holders of the Securities) or the relevant recipient in accordance with the terms of Securities.

The realizable value of any Conversion Shares received by a holder of the Securities following an Automatic Conversion may be significantly less than the Conversion Price (as defined herein) of £1.65 initially and holders of the Securities could lose all or part of their investment in the Securities as a result of the Automatic Conversion. Following an Automatic Conversion  the Securities shall remain in existence until the applicable Cancellation Date (as defined herein) for the sole purpose of evidencing (a) the holder's right to receive Conversion Shares or Conversion Shares Offer Consideration (as defined herein)  as applicable  from the Conversion Shares Depository and (b) the Issuer's CSO Obligations  if any. All obligations of the Issuer under the Securities (except for the CSO Obligations  if any) shall be irrevocably and automatically released inconsideration of the Issuer's issuance of the Conversion Shares to the Conversion Shares Depository (or other relevant recipient as described herein) on the Conversion Date.

Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 as it forms part of domestic law of the U.K. by virtue of the Withdrawal Act (the ""U.K. PRIIPs Regulation"") for offering or selling the Securities or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the U.K. has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Securities or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the U.K. may be unlawful under the U.K. PRIIPs Regulation. In addition to the above  pursuant to the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority Conduct of Business Sourcebook (""COBS"") the Securities are not intended to be offered  sold or otherwise made available and should not be offered  sold or otherwise made available to retail clients (as defined in COBS 3.4) in the U.K. U.K. MIFIR PRODUCT GOVERNANCE / PROFESSIONAL INVESTORS AND ECPS ONLY TARGET MARKET-Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer's product approval process  the target market assessment in respect of the Securities has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Securities is only eligible counterparties  as defined in COBS  and professional clients  as defined in U.K. MiFIR; and (ii) all channels for distribution of the Securities to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering  selling or recommending the Securities (a ""Distributor"") should take into consideration the manufacturers' target market assessment; however  a Distributor subject to the FCA Handbook Product Intervention and Product Governance Sourcebook (the ""U.K. MiFIR Product Governance Rules"") is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the Securities (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers' target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels. The Issuer is not a bank nor an authorized deposit-taking institution which is authorized under the Banking Act 1959 (Cth) of Australia (the ""Australian Banking Act"") nor is it authorized to carry on banking business under the Australian Banking Act. The Securities are not obligations of any government and  in particular  are not guaranteed by the Commonwealth of Australia. The Issuer is not supervised by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority. Securities that are offered for issue or sale or transferred in  or into  Australia are offered only in circumstances that would not require disclosure to investors under Part 6D.2 or Part 7.9 of the Corporations Act 2001 of Australia and issued and transferred in compliance with the terms of the exemption from compliance with section 66 of the Australian Banking Act that is available to the Issuer. Such Securities areissued or transferred in  or into  Australia in parcels of not less than A$500 000 in aggregate principal amount. An investment in any Securities issued by the Issuer will not be covered by the depositor protection provisions in section 13A of the Australian Banking Act and will not be covered by the Australian government's bank deposit guarantee (also commonly referred to as the Financial Claims Scheme) under the Australian Banking Act.

In particular  each potential investor should: have sufficient knowledge and experience to make a meaningful evaluation of the Securities  the merits and risk of investing in the Securities and the information contained or incorporated by reference in this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus; have access to  and knowledge of  appropriate analytical tools to evaluate  in the context of its particular financial situation  an investment in the Securities and the impact such investment will have on its overall investment portfolio; have sufficient financial resources and liquidity to bear all of the risks of an investment in the Securities or where the currency for principal or interest payments is different from the currency in which such investor's financial activities are principally denominated; understand thoroughly the terms of the Securities  such as the provisions governing an Automatic Conversion (including  in particular  the circumstances under which a Capital Adequacy Trigger Event may occur) and the situations in which interest payments may be cancelled or deemed cancelled and be familiar with the resolution regime applicable to the Group  including the possibility that the Securities may become subject to write-down or conversion if the resolution powers are exercised; be able to evaluate (either alone or with the help of a financial adviser) possible scenarios for economic  interest rate and other factors that may affect its investment and its ability to bear the applicable risks; and understand the accounting  legal  regulatory and tax implications of a purchase  and the holding and disposal of an investment in the Securities.

Each potential investor should consult its legal advisers to determine whether and to what extent: (i) the Securities are legal investments for it; (ii) the Securities can be used as collateral for various types of borrowing; and (iii) other restrictions apply to its purchase or pledge of the Securities. Financial institutions should consult their legal advisors or the appropriate regulators to determine the appropriate treatment of the Securities under any applicable risk-based capital or similar rules.

S-1PROHIBITION ON MARKETING AND SALES TO RETAIL INVESTORS The Securities are complex financial instruments and are not a suitable or appropriate investment for all investors  especially retail investors. In some jurisdictions  regulatory authorities have adopted or published laws  regulations or guidance with respect to the offer or sale of securities such as the Securities. Potential investors in the Securities should inform themselves of  and comply with  any applicable laws  regulations or regulatory guidance with respect to any resale of the Securities (or any beneficial interests therein). (a) In the U.K.  the COBS requires  in summary  that the Securities should not be offered or sold to retail clients (as defined in COBS 3.4 and each a ""retail client"") in the U.K. Certain of the underwriters are required to comply with the COBS. By purchasing  or making or accepting an offer to purchase  any Securities (or a beneficial interest in such Securities) from the Issuer and/or the underwriters  each prospective investor represents  warrants  agrees with and undertakes to the Issuer and each of the underwriters that: it is not a retail client in the U.K.; and it will not sell or offer the Securities (or any beneficial interest therein) to retail clients in the U.K. or communicate (including the distribution of this prospectus supplement or the accompanying prospectus) or approve an invitation or inducement to participate in  acquire or underwrite the Securities (or any beneficial interests therein) where that invitation or inducement is addressed to or disseminated in such a way that it is likely to be received by a retail client in the U.K. In selling or offering the Securities or making or approving communications relating to the Securities  prospective investors may not rely on the limited exemptions set out in the COBS. The obligations in paragraph 2 above are in addition to the need to comply at all times with all other applicable laws  regulations and regulatory guidance (whether inside or outside the EEA or the U.K.) relating to the promotion  offering  distribution and/or sale of the Securities (or any beneficial interests therein)  whether or not specifically mentioned in this prospectus supplement or the accompanying prospectus  including (without limitation) any requirements under MiFID II or the U.K. FCA Handbook as to determining the appropriateness and/or suitability of an investment in the Securities (or any beneficial interests therein) for investors in any relevant jurisdiction. Where acting as agent on behalf of a disclosed or undisclosed client when purchasing  or making or accepting an offer to purchase  any Securities (or any beneficial interests therein) from the Issuer and/ or the underwriters the foregoing representations  warranties  agreements and undertakings will be given by and be binding upon both the agent and its underlying client. IMPORTANT-PRIIPs REGULATION / PROHIBITION OF SALES TO EEA RETAIL INVESTORS. The Securities are not intended to be offered  sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered  sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the EEA. For these purposes  a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i) a retail client as defined in point (11) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II; or (ii) a customer within the meaning of the Insurance Distribution Directive  where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as defined in point (10) of Article 4(1) of MiFID II. Consequently  no key information document required by the PRIIPs Regulation for offering or selling the Securities or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the Securities or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation. U.K. MIFIR PRODUCT GOVERNANCE / PROFESSIONAL INVESTORS AND ECPS ONLY TARGET MARKET-Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer's product approval process  the target market assessment in respect of the Securities has led to the conclusion that: (i) the target market for the Securities is only eligible counterparties  as defined in COBS  and professional clients  as defined in U.K. MiFIR; S-2",neutral,0.02,0.97,0.01,negative,0.02,0.28,0.7,True,English,"['Prospectus Supplement', 'Barclays', 'Publication', '8.500% Fixed Rate Resetting Perpetual Subordinated Contingent Convertible Securities', 'U.K. Financial Conduct Authority', 'applicable Mid-Market Swap Rate', 'London Stock Exchange plc', 'relevant Reset Determination Date', 'U.K. MiFIR', 'fifth (5th) anniversary', 'three decimal places', 'initial interest rate', '0,000 aggregate principal amount', 'first Reset Date', 'subordinated obligations', 'Interest Payment Date', 'International Securities Market', 'perpetual securities', 'fixed maturity', 'Financial Services', 'quarterly rate', 'Barclays PLC', 'Issue Date', 'redemption date', 'Calculation Agent', 'market convention', 'regulated market', 'MiFID II', 'professional investors', 'Official List', 'domestic law', 'United Kingdom', 'European Union', 'absolute discretion', 'direct, unsecured', 'minimum denominations', 'integral multiples', 'additional interest', 'Prospectus Supplement', 'accompanying prospectus', 'Markets Act', 'sole discretion', 'The Securities', 'The ISM', 'The LSE', 'Withdrawal Act', 'Part VI', 'Issuer', 'December', 'annum', 'next', 'sum', 'conditions', 'arrear', 'March', 'June', 'September', 'year', 'purposes', 'FCA', 'contents', 'particulars', 'FSMA', 'Regulation', 'virtue', 'terms', 'times', 'reason', 'circumstances', 'respect', 'extent', 'accordance', 'case', 'holders', 'rights', 'compensation', 'result', 'cancellation', 'fact', 'winding-up', 'administration', 'preference', 'form', 'excess', 'option', 'day', 'period', '25']",2024-05-15,2024-05-16,marketscreener.com

The focus on improving our earnings sustainably in tandem with international expansion is increasingly showing up in our key figures and sets us clearly apart in our sector.Our international expansion continues to progress in line with our growth strategy. Our production facility in India  which went into operation in the third quarter of 2023  completed its first major deliveries to customers in the public safety sector in the first quarter. Our sales team in the United States is likewise being scaled up as planned. We are also on schedule with the expansion of our new site in Cluj  Romania  and the establishment of membrane production in the UK  which is an important building block in SFC Energy’s long-term competitiveness and the achievement of greater vertical integration.In the first quarter  a follow-up order worth a record EUR 27.8 million was awarded. This success is the result of the unwavering commitment of the entire team at SFC Energy  which is increasingly reflected in the sustainable expansion of the international footprint of our business as well as in long-term partnerships. One example of a successful partnership – both at the customer and the product level – is the series launch of the H 2 Genset mobile hydrogen (electricity) generator following a successful field test at music festivals  by construction companies and telecommunications providers. Together with our partners TEST-Fuchs GmbH from Austria and the Auto AG Group from Switzerland  we have already sold preliminary units after a period of just under 24 months from the initial idea to series production  including CE certification. Similarly  our newly developed EFOY ProShelter hybrid system is now proving its capabilities under extreme weather conditions in Northern Quebec  Canada  supplying electrical power to critical telecommunications infrastructure.At the Hanover Fair  we not only welcomed new customers and signed contracts  but also presented our EFOY H 2 PowerPack X50 pilot series (“EFOY Hydrogen Power Pack X50”). With a continuous electrical power output of 50 kW  the EFOY H 2 PowerPack X50 sets new standards and addresses a wider range of power requirements. Reliable  low-maintenance and emission-free output of up to 200 kW can be achieved by clustering four units. Our mobile and stationary power supply solutions based on our hydrogen and methanol fuel cells now offer a “continuous” power range from 20 W to 200 kW for a variety of customer applications.The extremely satisfying first quarter of 2024 was driven by the Clean Energy segment and the regions of Europe and Asia. In addition  a higher operating leverage effect  thanks to disproportionately low costs relative to sales  and a favourable product mix resulted in further significant improvements in margins.Development of orders and salesOrder intake in the reporting period came to EUR 51 608 thousand (Q1/2023: EUR 34 809 thousand). Accordingly  the Group’s order backlog widened to EUR 92 848 thousand as of March 31  2024 (December 31  2023: EUR 81 300 thousand).In the period from January 1 to March 31  2024  the SFC Energy Group generated significant growth of 45.9% in sales  which climbed to EUR 40 048 thousand (Q1/2023: EUR 27 454 thousand). This favourable performance is once again the result of strong organic growth in the Clean Energy segment. In regional terms  Asian business generated very positive impetus from India  delivering some of the strongest sales growth and significantly widening its share of Group sales to 27.4%  up from 3.5% in the previous year.Sales by segment in EUR thousand Q1/2024 Q1/2023 Clean Energy 30 804 17 764 Clean Power Management 9 244 9 690 Total 40 048 27 454Development of the segmentsSales in the Clean Energy segment increased significantly by 73.4% to EUR 30 804 thousand in the first quarter of 2024  up from EUR 17 764 thousand in the same quarter of the previous year. The segment’s sales growth was driven on the one hand by fuel cell solutions for industrial applications – which made the greatest contribution to segment sales – and on the other hand by higher sales to customers in the public safety sector. Sales to industrial customers in the segment climbed by around 30% compared to the previous year. By contrast  sales to customers for private applications decreased. Clean Energy  whose share of Group sales widened significantly in the first quarter to 76.9% (Q1/2023: 64.7%)  remained the segment with the highest sales. By contrast  the Clean Power Management segment’s share of Group sales contracted to 23.1% (Q1/2023: 35.3%). Sales in this segment fell slightly by 4.6% to EUR 9 224 thousand in the quarter under review  compared to EUR 9 690 thousand in the previous year. While business in Power Management solutions expanded noticeably  frequency converter business for the upstream oil and gas industry experienced a decline over the same quarter of the previous year.Development of earningsThe sharp organic sales growth and the significant increase in the gross profit margin in both segments led to a substantial 75.2% increase in gross profit to EUR 17 893 thousand in the first quarter of 2024 (Q1/2023: EUR 10 214 thousand). The resulting gross margin for the Group came to 44.7% in the quarter under review (Q1/2023: 37.2%)  significantly higher than in the same quarter of the previous year.Gross profit for the individual segments compared to the previous year is as follows:Gross profit by segment in EUR thousand Q1/2024 Q1/2023 Clean Energy 15 296 7 648 Clean Power Management 2 597 2 566 Total 17 893 10 214EBITDA adjusted for non-recurring effects climbed significantly in the first quarter of 2024 to EUR 8 997 thousand (Q1/2023: EUR 3 347 thousand)  mainly due to the higher gross profit and the disproportionally small increase in functional costs relative to sales. The adjusted EBITDA margin also widened at an extraordinary rate compared to the previous year to 22.5% (Q1/2023: 12.2%).EBIT adjusted for non-recurring effects rose to EUR 7 548 thousand (Q1/2023: EUR 2 151 thousand)  resulting in an adjusted EBIT margin of 18.8%  which was more than double that of the previous year (Q1/2023: 7.8%). The first quarter closed with a consolidated net result for the period of EUR 5 248 thousand (Q1/2023: EUR 2 035 thousand)  which corresponds to an increase of 157.8%. Undiluted and diluted earnings per share in accordance with IFRS improved in the quarter under review to EUR 0.30 and EUR 0.29 respectively (Q1/2023: EUR 0.12 and EUR 0.11 respectively).Balance sheetAt 72.5% as of March 31  2024  the equity ratio was broadly unchanged over the end of 2023 (72.6%). The net financial position (freely available cash and cash equivalents less liabilities to banks) increased to EUR 63 234 thousand as of March 31  2024 (December 31  2023: EUR 56 056 thousand). As of March 31  2024  the SFC Energy Group had 413 permanent employees (December 31  2023: 403).Forecast for 2024Following a very successful start to the 2024 financial year  which saw exceptionally strong sales growth in the Clean Energy segment  the Management Board confirms its full-year forecast for the current financial year dated February 22  2024 and expects Group sales of between EUR 141.7 million to EUR 153.5 million (2023: EUR 118.1 million)  adjusted EBITDA in the range of EUR 17.5 million to EUR 22.4 million (2023: EUR 15.2 million) and adjusted EBIT of EUR 9.8 million to EUR 14.7 million (2023: EUR 9.7 million). In particular  this forecast takes account of expenses in connection with regional expansion and the establishment of MEA production in Swindon  UK  the expansion of the service and sales subsidiary in Orem (UT)  United States  and the ramp-up of the production company in Cluj  Romania  which will have a negative impact on earnings in the Clean Energy segment.Furthermore  the Management Board assumes that there will be capacity restrictions in the production of fuel cells in the second and possibly the third quarter  depending on the availability of MEAs.Key figures for Q1 2024/Q1 2023in EUR thousand 01/01–03/31/2024 01/01–03/31/2023 Sales 40 048 27 453 Gross profit 17 893 10 214 Gross margin 44.7 % 37.2 % EBITDA 8 640 3 506 EBITDA margin 21.6 % 12.8 % Adjusted EBITDA 8 997 3 347 Adjusted EBITDA margin 22.5 % 12.2 % EBIT 7 191 2 310 EBIT margin 18.0 % 8.4 % Adjusted EBIT 7 548 2 151 Adjusted EBIT margin 18.8 % 7.8 % Consolidated net result for the period 5 248 2 035 Order book* 92 848 81 300* As of March 31  2024/December 31  2023Detailed financial informationSFC Energy AG’s interim statement for the first quarter of 2024 is available at www.sfc.com.SFC Energy AG will be holding a conference call in English for interested investors and members of the press today  May 15  2024  at 9.00 a.m.To register  please send an e-mail to susan.hoffmeister@sfc.com.About SFC Energy AGSFC Energy AG is a leading provider of hydrogen and methanol fuel cells for stationary and mobile hybrid power solutions.

40985,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://news.artnet.com/art-world/ai-photo-london-2487330,New A.I. Works Fuse Fantasy and Memory at Photo London,This year's Photo London fair once again presents some of the latest developments in A.I.  including a new project by Roope Rainisto.,As art fairs go  this year’s Photo London is an entertaining romp. Featuring 120 exhibitors from nearly 50 cities  it promises delights at every turn  from huge names like Steven Meisel  Martin Parr  and Lee Miller to the next generation of creators. Take for example artists spotlighted by the Deutsche Börse Photography Foundation  which places its emphasis on particularly timely topics. These include Marvel Harris’s ongoing series Inner Journey  which documents his gender transition  Anastasia Samoylova’s subtle studies of impending climate doom in Miami  and Philip Montgomery’s visions of American life racked by inner turmoil.Among several strong solo presentations of women photographers  the standouts are charming portraits of New York street life by Helen Levitt at Cologne’s Zander Galerie and the strikingly monochromatic landscapes  interiors  and still lifes of Yildiz Moran  a Turkish photographer who deserves greater recognition  presented by Galeri Nev from Ankara. This year’s Master of Photography  Valérie Belin  is honored by a small retrospective that also features entirely new  unseen work.For those hoping to determine what new directions the medium might be taking  the fair is littered with pieces that show how photography keeps evolving as it feeds into and emerges out of all manner of artistic practices. On show are textiles  sculptural pieces  and paintings  alongside an increasingly prominent yet still controversial presence: A.I. Here are some of the most interesting examples on show.Roope RainistoFinnish artist Roope Rainisto has become a prominent name on the Web3 scene for his experimental projects using A.I. He will likely be unknown to many attendees of Photo London  who will encounter his latest series  Vacation  presented by the NFT platform Verse Works in an immersive holiday-inspired setting. Almost like ads  the works contain hyperreal images of classic vacation scenes that are imbued with heightened luxury and beauty. At a passing glance nothing is amiss but  on closer inspection  limbs suddenly appear out of nowhere  a diner stool has too many legs  or a plane is strangely distorted.Is there always such a chasm between our want or expectation and the eventual reality? “Dream” holidays represent a utopian ideal into which we can escape  if only for a week or two. Their innate impossibility and the disappointments that follow lay bear the hollow superficiality of our aspirations.“That’s really the perfect theme for A.I.  to visualize these fantasies ” said Rainisto at the show’s installation. “The photographic style gives people the impression that it’s reality. I want to play with that [assumption].”He noted also that  unlike on a small digital screen  the physical prints can be blown up to show off the works’ impressively high resolution. “You can actually see small skin details  so you really get the extra impact of the size.”Sander CoersAt some point  our recollection of a trip will become almost entirely informed by faded old photographs. The eerily false impression this inevitably creates is at the heart of Dutch artist Sander Coers’s series POST  from which several new works are on view at Open Doors Gallery. Small-scale  fragmented  and grainy  his images evoke a nostalgic longing that is hard to place. A man wades through a field of flowers that reach up to his waist amid alpine scenery. A well groomed 1950s-style couple stare out to sea. If these images aren’t real then what are the tell-tale signs?That A.I.-generated images are plainly fake yet still manage to evoke something close to truth underscores the futility of looking to any one image for an objective or faithful representation. Rather  our vision of the past always takes on a cinematic quality  regardless of the medium.Jamie GallagherAt Notton Gallery in the fair’s Discovery section  artist Jamie Gallagher has taken a different approach  training A.I. on his previous paintings in order to create images that reinterpret his style in new and unexpected ways. The alien-like beings that result have taken on a life of their own  much as any creative act is inevitably born out of what came before.Photo London 2024 is at Somerset House in London through May 19.Follow Artnet News on Facebook:,neutral,0.13,0.86,0.01,mixed,0.32,0.21,0.47,True,English,"['New A.I.', 'Photo London', 'Fantasy', 'Memory', 'Deutsche Börse Photography Foundation', 'several strong solo presentations', 'Dutch artist Sander Coers', 'Finnish artist Roope Rainisto', 'New York street life', 'A.I.-generated images', 'impending climate doom', 'Valérie Belin', 'immersive holiday-inspired setting', 'small digital screen', 'small skin details', 'artist Jamie Gallagher', 'new, unseen work', 'Open Doors Gallery', 'classic vacation scenes', 'several new works', 'small retrospective', 'new directions', 'Notton Gallery', 'American life', 'art fairs', 'entertaining romp', 'huge names', 'Steven Meisel', 'Martin Parr', 'Lee Miller', 'next generation', 'example artists', 'timely topics', 'Marvel Harris', 'Inner Journey', 'gender transition', 'Anastasia Samoylova', 'subtle studies', 'Philip Montgomery', 'inner turmoil', 'women photographers', 'charming portraits', 'Helen Levitt', 'Zander Galerie', 'monochromatic landscapes', 'Yildiz Moran', 'Turkish photographer', 'greater recognition', 'Galeri Nev', 'artistic practices', 'controversial presence', 'interesting examples', 'Web3 scene', 'experimental projects', 'many attendees', 'NFT platform', 'heightened luxury', 'passing glance', 'closer inspection', 'diner stool', 'many legs', 'Dream” holidays', 'utopian ideal', 'innate impossibility', 'hollow superficiality', 'perfect theme', 'physical prints', 'high resolution', 'extra impact', 'old photographs', 'nostalgic longing', 'alpine scenery', '1950s-style couple', 'tell-tale signs', 'one image', 'faithful representation', 'cinematic quality', 'Discovery section', 'different approach', 'unexpected ways', 'creative act', 'Somerset House', 'Artnet News', 'hyperreal images', 'Photo London', 'Verse Works', 'ongoing series', 'latest series', 'sculptural pieces', 'prominent name', 'eventual reality', 'photographic style', 'false impression', 'previous paintings', '120 exhibitors', '50 cities', 'delights', 'turn', 'creators', 'emphasis', 'Miami', 'visions', 'standouts', 'Cologne', 'interiors', 'still', 'lifes', 'Ankara', 'Master', 'medium', 'manner', 'show', 'textiles', 'ads', 'beauty', 'limbs', 'plane', 'chasm', 'want', 'expectation', 'week', 'disappointments', 'aspirations', 'fantasies', 'installation', 'people', 'size', 'recollection', 'trip', 'faded', 'heart', 'POST', 'view', 'field', 'flowers', 'waist', 'sea', 'something', 'truth', 'futility', 'objective', 'past', 'order', 'alien', 'beings', 'May', 'Facebook']",2024-05-16,2024-05-16,news.artnet.com

Banijay Entertainment (form…,EXCLUSIVE: There’s a group-wide rebrand afoot at FL Entertainment  the parent of Big Brother firm Banijay.Euronext Amsterdam-listed FL will now be known as Banijay Group  with three Banijay-branded subsidiaries sitting underneath. Banijay Entertainment (formerly Banijay) will house the content production and distribution business under CEO Marco Bassetti.Banijay Live is the new moniker for live experiences business Banijay Events  and Banijay Gaming is the new name for the company’s online sports betting and gaming activities  housing Betclic and Bet at Home.From a reporting standpoint  Banijay Entertainment and Banijay Live will be housed together under Bassetti  with Nicolas Béraud running Banijay Gaming as CEO.Like the existing Banijay TV group  Banijay Entertainment will comprise more than 130 production companies across 21 territories. Producers in the group include Bunim/Murray  the Endemol Shine- and Nordisk-branded labels  Grøenlandia  Initial  Kudos  Mastiff  Remarkable and Stephen David Entertainment and Banijay Rights is the distributor  shopping the likes of Big Brother  Deal or No Deal  Peaky Blinders  Survivor and MasterChef around the world.The division will retain its pink Banijay branding and leaderships and staff remain unchanged.“This strategic rebranding reflects the complementarity nature of our existing activities and underlines our ambition as an integrated and diversified entertainment leader ” said Banijay Group CEO François Riahi. “Banijay Group gathers an incredible amount of talent  committed to create passion  emotion and to conceive entertaining experiences for the general public globally.”FL Entertainment was formed in May 2022 through a merger with Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) Pegasus Entrepreneurs  which was backed by European asset management company Tikehau Capital and investment firm Financière Agache. The move saw Banijay founder Stephane Courbit take Banijay and Betclic public in a deal backed by the likes of Bernard Arnault and Vincent Bolloré.The company launched with an enterprise value of €7.2B ($7.8B). In March  we reported FL had increased revenue nearly 6% year-on-year to reach €3.3B and adjusted EBIDTA nearly 7% to €494M. Q1 2024 results showed revenues up 10.6% at €1B and adjusted earnings of €164M.Banijay remains the biggest indie production house in the world by turnover  ahead of the likes of ITV Studios and Fremantle. The company was created in 2008 after former Endemol Shine France boss Courbit acquired a number of European production outfits. It was previously known as Banijay Entertainment in a period before it merged with another European production group  Zodiak Media  to form Banijay Group in 2015. Banijay later bought Endemol Shine Group before FL Entertainment was formed and listed on the Dutch stock exchange.Whippet handled the rebrand.,neutral,0.03,0.97,0.0,neutral,0.07,0.92,0.01,True,English,"['Big Brother’ Company', 'FL Entertainment', 'Banijay Group', 'Rebrand', 'former Endemol Shine France boss Courbit', 'biggest indie production house', 'Special Purpose Acquisition Company', 'European asset management company', 'Endemol Shine Group', 'existing Banijay TV group', 'European production outfits', 'three Banijay-branded subsidiaries', 'online sports betting', 'Nicolas Béraud', 'François Riahi', 'Financière Agache', 'Dutch stock exchange', 'European production group', 'Stephen David Entertainment', 'diversified entertainment leader', 'Euronext Amsterdam-listed FL', 'pink Banijay branding', 'Big Brother firm', 'CEO Marco Bassetti', 'live experiences business', 'Banijay Group CEO', 'Stephane Courbit', 'existing activities', 'content production', '130 production companies', 'distribution business', 'entertaining experiences', 'investment firm', 'Banijay Live', 'FL Entertainment', 'Banijay Entertainment', 'new moniker', 'new name', 'gaming activities', 'reporting standpoint', 'Nordisk-branded labels', 'Grøenlandia', 'Peaky Blinders', 'strategic rebranding', 'complementarity nature', 'incredible amount', 'general public', 'Pegasus Entrepreneurs', 'Tikehau Capital', 'Bernard Arnault', 'Vincent Bolloré', 'enterprise value', 'Q1 2024 results', 'ITV Studios', 'Zodiak Media', 'Banijay Events', 'Banijay Gaming', 'Banijay Rights', 'Banijay founder', 'group-wide rebrand', 'No Deal', 'parent', 'housing', 'Betclic', 'Home', '21 territories', 'Producers', 'Bunim/Murray', 'Initial', 'Kudos', 'Mastiff', 'Remarkable', 'distributor', 'likes', 'Survivor', 'MasterChef', 'world', 'division', 'leaderships', 'staff', 'ambition', 'integrated', 'talent', 'passion', 'emotion', 'May', 'merger', 'SPAC', 'move', 'March', 'revenue', 'year', 'EBIDTA', 'earnings', 'turnover', 'Fremantle', 'number', 'period', 'Whippet']",2024-05-15,2024-05-16,deadline.com

Euronext  which operates stock markets across Paris  Amsterdam  Brussels  Dublin  Lisbon and Oslo  said liquidity for the French company is “massively better” in Europe than in the US.European exchanges are struggling to hold on to companies that believe they can achieve higher valuations from the deeper pool of investors in the US. The urge to shake off this discount is particularly strong for Big Oil  which is regarded more favorably by Wall Street fund managers who pay less attention to environmental  social and governance metrics than their European peers.TotalEnergies CEO Patrick Pouyanne has said the findings of a study into a potential switch in primary listing from Paris to New York would be presented to the board in September. He returned to the topic Wednesday during a panel discussion at the Qatar Economic Forum.“There is no emotion — it’s a question of business ” Pouyanne said in Doha. “What we observe is that we have more and more US shareholders. Today we can only offer them ADR and we want to offer them shares.”“We have less European shareholders  including French shareholders  probably because of all the debate about ESG  etcetera ” Pouyanne said. “And then you see quite a difference of valuation between the US market and the European market. So it’s a fiduciary duty for the board to study” the proposal  he said.French President Emmanuel Macron has voiced his disapproval at the possibility  saying he would be “not at all” happy with such a decision by the oil giant.Boujnah said that European investors are “more tempted” to follow ESG requirements  which reduces their appetite for the sector. “It’s true that the peers of Total enjoy better multiple valuations in the US because the investor base in the US remains more friendly to oil and gas than the European investor base.”The European Union’s largest bank  BNP Paribas SA  for instance  has said it won’t be participating in conventional bond issuance for the oil and gas sector increasing its restrictions on fossil-fuel clients.Shell Plc CEO Wael Sawan  on the other hand  has said the oil major continues to trade below “fair market value ” but believes that “simply relisting is not going to address” the fundamental valuation of the company.,neutral,0.38,0.61,0.01,mixed,0.16,0.29,0.55,True,English,"['Euronext CEO', 'Main Listing', 'Total', 'Paris', 'Euronext Chief Executive Officer Stephane Boujnah', 'Shell Plc CEO Wael Sawan', 'Pan-European stock exchange Euronext NV', 'French energy giant TotalEnergies SE', 'Wall Street fund managers', 'French President Emmanuel Macron', 'TotalEnergies CEO Patrick Pouyanne', 'Qatar Economic Forum', 'BNP Paribas SA', 'conventional bond issuance', 'The European Union', 'primary stock listing', 'fair market value', 'European investor base', 'US investor money', 'less European shareholders', 'French shareholders', 'stock markets', 'primary listing', 'oil giant', 'European market', 'French company', 'main listing', 'less attention', 'European exchanges', 'New York', 'technical solutions', 'Bloomberg TV', 'higher valuations', 'deeper pool', 'environmental, social', 'governance metrics', 'potential switch', 'panel discussion', 'fiduciary duty', 'multiple valuations', 'largest bank', 'fossil-fuel clients', 'other hand', 'US shareholders', 'US market', 'European peers', 'European investors', 'potential move', 'valuation gap', 'fundamental valuation', 'US competitors', 'Big Oil', 'oil major', 'ESG requirements', 'gas sector', 'order', 'liquidity', 'interview', 'Wednesday', 'Paris', 'Amsterdam', 'Brussels', 'Dublin', 'Lisbon', 'Oslo', 'companies', 'urge', 'discount', 'findings', 'study', 'board', 'September', 'topic', 'emotion', 'question', 'business', 'Doha', 'ADR', 'shares', 'debate', 'difference', 'proposal', 'disapproval', 'possibility', 'decision', 'appetite', 'instance', 'restrictions', 'relisting']",2024-05-15,2024-05-16,rigzone.com

The collaboration was expanded in January 2022 to two new disease areas  Heart Failure and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)  demonstrating how the Benevolent Platform™ can be applied across multiple therapeutic areas.The innovative collaboration structure sees scientists and technologists from the two companies work side-by-side  combining BenevolentAI’s AI-driven drug discovery platform and biomedical knowledge with AstraZeneca’s scientific and disease specific expertise  leading to novel and robust Target Identification. Both the initial and extended collaboration were agreed on similar terms with upfront payments on signing  research funding alongside discovery  development and commercial milestones. Additionally  the Company will receive tiered royalties on net sales of any commercialised products.Heart Failure is a complex syndrome which occurs when the heart cannot pump enough blood around the body. It is often complicated by multiple interrelated diseases  so requires a deep understanding of the potential disease drivers in individual patients. Current heart failure treatments follow a “one-size-fits-all” approach. However  due to the wide range of mechanisms by which heart failure can occur  there remains an unmet need for new therapies as up to 50% of patients die within five years of diagnosis.Dr Anne Phelan  Chief Scientific Officer of BenevolentAI  said:“I am delighted that AstraZeneca has selected one of the novel Heart Failure targets that we have been jointly working on to enter its portfolio. Heart Failure is a therapeutic area where there is significant medical need but  due to the size of the market  requires a team effort and significant momentum  so we are delighted to be working with AstraZeneca in this important field of medicine.”Regina Fritsche Danielson  SVP and Head of Research and Early Development  Cardiovascular  Renal and Metabolism  at AstraZeneca said :“Our ongoing collaboration with BenevolentAI has been instrumental in uncovering new insights into complex diseases such as CKD and Heart Failure. This shared expertise  combined with the power of AI  has the potential to identify the right therapeutic targets for patients with heart failure and help deliver the next generation of innovative therapies.”About BenevolentAIAt BenevolentAI (AMS: BAI)  we serve patients by leveraging our proprietary and validated Benevolent Platform™ that integrates AI and science to uncover new biology  predict novel targets and develop first-in-class or best-in-class drugs for complex diseases. By applying proprietary advanced AI tools  in combination with in-house scientific expertise and wet-lab facilities  BenevolentAI is well-positioned to identify and accelerate novel drug discovery. The Company’s business model presents multiple routes for value creation  including discovery collaborations with pharma companies like AstraZeneca and Merck and advancing in-house pipelines to inflection points. Headquartered in London  with wet labs in Cambridge (UK)  BenevolentAI is at the forefront of reshaping the future of drug discovery and delivering innovative medicines.Category: non-regulatoryView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240514379947/en/Investors:Catherine Isted – Chief Financial Officerinvestors@benevolent.aiT: +44(0) 203 781 9360Media:James Osbornpress@benevolent.aiT: +44(0) 203 781 9360FTI Consulting:Ben Atwell/Simon Conway/Victoria Foster MitchellBenevolentAI@fticonsulting.comT: +44 203 727 1000,neutral,0.15,0.82,0.03,mixed,0.37,0.3,0.33,True,English,"['Novel Heart Failure Target', 'Further Success', 'AstraZeneca Collaboration', 'BenevolentAI', 'Current heart failure treatments', 'two new disease areas', 'AI-driven drug discovery platform', 'proprietary advanced AI tools', 'novel Heart Failure targets', 'chronic kidney disease', 'continued positive progress', 'idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Dr Anne Phelan', 'Regina Fritsche Danielson', 'Chief Financial Officer', 'Victoria Foster Mitchell', 'multiple therapeutic areas', 'right therapeutic targets', 'disease specific expertise', 'potential disease drivers', 'biopharma drug discovery', 'potential new treatments', 'Chief Scientific Officer', 'AI-drug discovery platform', 'novel drug discovery', 'robust Target Identification', 'multiple interrelated diseases', 'significant medical need', 'innovative collaboration structure', 'house scientific expertise', 'novel targets', 'two companies', 'multiple routes', 'new therapies', 'new insights', 'new biology', 'First target', 'unmet need', 'significant momentum', 'discovery collaborations', 'house pipelines', 'complex diseases', 'innovative therapies', 'innovative medicines', 'Benevolent Platform™', 'Further Success', 'Euronext Amsterdam', 'discovery portfolio', 'biomedical knowledge', 'similar terms', 'upfront payments', 'commercial milestones', 'tiered royalties', 'net sales', 'commercialised products', 'complex syndrome', 'enough blood', 'deep understanding', 'wide range', 'five years', 'team effort', 'next generation', 'wet-lab facilities', 'business model', 'value creation', 'pharma companies', 'inflection points', 'wet labs', 'source version', 'Catherine Isted', 'James Osborn', 'FTI Consulting', 'Ben Atwell', 'Simon Conway', 'extended collaboration', 'strategic collaboration', 'ongoing collaboration', 'important field', 'Early Development', 'class drugs', 'The Company', 'individual patients', 'AstraZeneca Collaboration', 'BenevolentAI', 'BAI', 'leader', 'IPF', 'CKD', 'January', 'SLE', 'scientists', 'technologists', 'initial', 'signing', 'research', 'body', 'approach', 'mechanisms', 'diagnosis', 'size', 'market', 'SVP', 'Head', 'Cardiovascular', 'Renal', 'Metabolism', 'power', 'science', 'combination', 'Merck', 'London', 'Cambridge', 'UK', 'forefront', 'future', 'Category', 'regulatory', 'businesswire', 'Investors', 'Media', 'fticonsulting']",2024-05-15,2024-05-16,investorsobserver.com

In 2022  JCDecaux – a global-leading player  the inventor of the self-cleaning public toilet and the current operator of 435 facilities – was commissioned by the City of Paris to replace and modernise its facilities  following a competitive tender process that began in August 2020. The roll-out began after a 2-year manufacturing process.More hygienic  more eco-friendly and with a higher capacity  these new facilities will gradually replace the current models to promote universal access to hygiene services in the public realm.The toilets will be installed by early July 2024 on all the Olympic Games sites. Installation of the remaining models will take place from September 2024 to May 2025.JCDecaux and its partners Enedis and Eau de Paris (Paris Water) will replace around 10 toilets a week  located throughout the districts of Paris  to ensure consistently high service quality in each of the city’s districts. Facilities will be removed and installed at night  to avoid disturbing traffic and pedestrian flows. The new installation will perfectly fit the current footprint.Combining technology and manufacturing performance to serve Paris  Parisians and its visitorsThanks to its 40 years of industry experience  JCDecaux harnessed the expertise of its fully-integrated teams in R&D  engineering  ergonomics  design and operations to jointly develop a facility that caters to every need of the City of Paris. The all-new model will operate faster  with hands-free interfaces and equipped with a second urinal cabin. JCDecaux was supported by an industrial value chain across France  mainly comprising SMEs  to manufacture facility parts assembled at its manufacturing centre in Les Yvelines.The completion of these new self-cleaning public toilets represents an achievement  both from a technological and manufacturing standpoint. The Group overcame numerous challenges  whether technical  ecological or societal  to deliver an even higher quality service for Parisians and visitors alike.With functionality as a top priority  JCDecaux’s teams designed a toilet facility with a spacious main cabin that enables universal access and a second urinal cabin  respecting the same footprint as the current facility. The waiting time between each visit to the main cabin is now reduced by a third  with the time between a customer leaving the toilet and it being available for the next customer reduced to just 30 seconds. During this time  the toilet cabin is cleaned and disinfected for the comfort of the next user. The urinal cabin is disinfected immediately after each user visit and available immediately with no waiting time. As a result  the capacity of the automatic public toilets in the capital will be doubled to accommodate 870 users simultaneously  while the availability of the service will be multiplied by four  making it the largest network of public toilets in any city worldwide.Priority number two was low-impact. JCDecaux’s engineers developed a system that cuts water consumption by almost 2/3rds and electricity consumption by 1/3rd compared to the current position. In addition  JCDecaux focused on reducing the weight of the facilities to shrink CO 2 emissions during manufacture and transportation by opting for lighter materials with an optimised design. As a result  compared to the previous cycle  this new facility’s manufacturing phase halves the impact of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. Replaced toilets will be refurbished before being redeployed to other markets in France or internationally. Cleaning and maintenance operatives  who are pivotal to ensuring service quality  will now use cargo bikes during servicing  in an effort to promote environmentally-friendly practices and zero traffic congestion. Repairs requiring spare parts will be carried out by operatives driving electric vehicles.A project championing universal access to hygiene in the public realmThanks to JCDecaux’s teams  the new facility has innovative features to encourage best-in-class hygiene standards.All customer interfaces will operate hands-free.The facility’s external fountain and wash-hand sink include a detergent dispenser  enabling all users to wash their hands when they are in the public space.The toilet bowl is washed and disinfected after each use  while an innovative cleaning process uses water economically to fully clean and remove any rubbish left on the floor.A free-of-charge app will also enable users to check the availability of facilities in their area  the shortest route to reach them and other useful information.The public will be able to report any vandalism or maintenance requests in real time so JCDecaux’s teams can respond as quickly as possible.Design that respects the heritage of ParisPatrick Jouin  who designed the French capital’s current fleet  was tasked with creating the new facility’s aesthetics  aligning the silhouette with the existing model. This enables the easy identification of the service by the public  seamlessly integrating into the Parisian cityscape and providing an elegant  sleek and timeless aesthetic with this subtle redesign. Particular care was taken with the roof to provide a visual amenity with the surrounding buildings.Readily accessible facilitiesThe new toilets fully comply with NFP 99-611  which is the go-to standard for public sanitary facilities. They are fitted with a “C” type cabin  allowing ample space for a person in a wheelchair to make a complete turn and leave the wheelchair on its side if moved on to the toilet seat. The facility’s multiple features serve to guarantee greater access. These include level access  hands-free buttons positioned at optimal height  large mirrors  accessible coat-hooks  a washbasin  a detergent dispenser and hand dryer  and adaptive lighting. In addition  a standard-compliant (NF S32-002) remote control provides instructions for people who are visually or hearing impaired. Externally  these messages guide users to the toilet (within a 5-metre radius)  updating them on availability (vacant/cleaning underway/occupied). Inside the facility  operating instructions are given next to each of its amenities. The second urinal provides the added advantage of increasing capacity for people with reduced mobility as they use the main cabin.Patrick Jouin  the Designer behind the new facility  said: “Working in tandem with JCDecaux  we enter a new era for the French capital’s cityscape. True to the aesthetics of our initial model  this next generation of public toilets takes on a sleek design  with a more distinctive silhouette designed to interact with Paris’ iconic urban infrastructure including its Morris columns and Wallace fountains. All features harmoniously fit to scale.”Jean-Charles Decaux  Chairman of the Executive Board and Co-CEO of JCDecaux  said: “As the French capital prepares for the arrival of millions of visitors this summer  we are proud to initiate the roll-out of a new generation of self-cleaning public toilets. In line with our commitments  we installed the first of these new models on schedule. I want to commend this achievement from an industrial and operational perspective  and sincerely thank all of our teams and partners who worked tirelessly for the duration of this initiative. For more than 40 years  JCDecaux has strived to promote public hygiene  drawing on its founder’s invention of the first-ever self-cleaning toilet in 1981 with the two inaugural models installed in Paris’ Beaubourg district. Backed by its unique expertise as designer and operator  JCDecaux currently manages the world’s leading network of automatic public toilets  with 31 million users per year. Our toilets in Paris serve more than 15 million users each year. Thanks to this new model  Paris will benefit from the most innovative and greatest capacity fleet in the world. We remain convinced of the growing use of these facilities  with increased universal access to hygiene in the public realm.”Key Figures for JCDecaux2023 revenue: €3 570.0m (a)N°1 Out-of-Home Media company worldwideA daily audience of 850 million people in more than 80 countries1 056 833 advertising panels worldwidePresent in 3 918 cities with more than 10 000 inhabitants11 650 employeesJCDecaux is listed on the Eurolist of Euronext Paris and is part of the Euronext 100 and Euronext Family Business indexesJCDecaux is recognised for its extra-financial performance in the FTSE4Good (3.4/5)  CDP (A)  MSCI (AAA)  Sustainalytics (13.7)  and has achieved Gold Medal status from EcoVadis1st Out-of-Home Media company to join the RE100Leader in self-service bike rental scheme: pioneer in eco-friendly mobilityN°1 worldwide in street furniture (630 196 advertising panels)N°1 worldwide in transport advertising with 153 airports and 258 contracts in metros  buses  trains and tramways (319 081 advertising panels)N°1 in Europe for billboards (85 743 advertising panels worldwide)N°1 in outdoor advertising in Europe (708 620 advertising panels)N°1 in outdoor advertising in Asia-Pacific (165 292 advertising panels)N°1 in outdoor advertising in Latin America (91 682 advertising panels)N°1 in outdoor advertising in Africa (25 337 advertising panels)N°1 in outdoor advertising in the Middle East (21 300 advertising panels)(a) Adjusted revenueFor more information about JCDecaux  please visit jcdecaux.com .Join us on Twitter   LinkedIn   Facebook   Instagram and YouTube.Communications Department: Albert Asséraf+33 (0) 1 30 79 79 10 – albert.asseraf@jcdecaux.comInvestor Relations: Rémi Grisard+33 (0) 1 30 79 79 93 – remi.grisard@jcdecaux.comAttachment,neutral,0.02,0.97,0.01,positive,0.75,0.24,0.02,True,English,"['next-generation public toilet facilities', 'JCDecaux', 'roll-out', 'City', 'Paris', 'one outdoor advertising company', 'Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions', 'new self-cleaning public toilets', 'next-generation public toilet facilities', 'competitive tender process', 'industrial value chain', 'zero traffic congestion', 'other useful information', '2-year manufacturing process', 'second urinal cabin', 'Olympic Games sites', 'spacious main cabin', 'class hygiene standards', 'automatic public toilets', 'high service quality', 'innovative cleaning process', 'Eau de Paris', 'higher quality service', 'CO 2 emissions', 'toilet cabin', 'public realm', 'public space', 'Paralympic Games', 'disturbing traffic', 'other markets', 'innovative features', 'toilet bowl', 'new model', 'manufacturing performance', 'manufacturing centre', 'manufacturing standpoint', 'manufacturing phase', 'Replaced toilets', 'toilet facility', 'new facility', 'global-leading player', 'current operator', 'higher capacity', 'current models', 'universal access', 'hygiene services', 'early July', 'remaining models', 'pedestrian flows', 'current footprint', 'industry experience', 'R&D', 'hands-free interfaces', 'Les Yvelines', 'The Group', 'numerous challenges', 'top priority', 'same footprint', 'next user', 'electricity consumption', 'current position', 'lighter materials', 'previous cycle', 'cargo bikes', 'environmentally-friendly practices', 'spare parts', 'electric vehicles', 'external fountain', 'wash-hand sink', 'detergent dispenser', 'shortest route', 'maintenance requests', 'Paris 2024 Olympic', 'new facilities', 'new installation', 'facility parts', 'current facility', 'next customer', 'water consumption', 'customer interfaces', 'waiting time', 'real time', 'user visit', 'Priority number', 'maintenance operatives', 'Euronext Paris', 'integrated teams', 'Paris Water', 'JCDecaux SE', '10 toilets', '435 facilities', 'roll-out', '15 May', 'citizens', 'millions', 'tourists', 'inventor', 'August', 'September', 'partners', 'Enedis', 'districts', 'night', 'technology', 'Parisians', 'visitors', '40 years', 'expertise', 'engineering', 'ergonomics', 'design', 'operations', 'need', 'France', 'SMEs', 'completion', 'achievement', 'technological', 'societal', 'functionality', '30 seconds', 'comfort', 'result', 'capital', '870 users', 'availability', 'network', 'impact', 'engineers', 'system', '2/3rds', '1/3rd', 'addition', 'weight', 'manufacture', 'transportation', 'servicing', 'effort', 'Repairs', 'project', 'rubbish', 'floor', 'charge', 'app', 'area', 'vandalism']",2024-05-15,2024-05-16,marketscreener.com

The collaboration was expanded in January 2022 to two new disease areas  Heart Failure and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)  demonstrating how the Benevolent Platform™ can be applied across multiple therapeutic areas.The innovative collaboration structure sees scientists and technologists from the two companies work side-by-side  combining BenevolentAI’s AI-driven drug discovery platform and biomedical knowledge with AstraZeneca’s scientific and disease specific expertise  leading to novel and robust Target Identification. Both the initial and extended collaboration were agreed on similar terms with upfront payments on signing  research funding alongside discovery  development and commercial milestones. Additionally  the Company will receive tiered royalties on net sales of any commercialised products.Heart Failure is a complex syndrome which occurs when the heart cannot pump enough blood around the body. It is often complicated by multiple interrelated diseases  so requires a deep understanding of the potential disease drivers in individual patients. Current heart failure treatments follow a “one-size-fits-all” approach. However  due to the wide range of mechanisms by which heart failure can occur  there remains an unmet need for new therapies as up to 50% of patients die within five years of diagnosis.Dr Anne Phelan  Chief Scientific Officer of BenevolentAI  said:“I am delighted that AstraZeneca has selected one of the novel Heart Failure targets that we have been jointly working on to enter its portfolio. Heart Failure is a therapeutic area where there is significant medical need but  due to the size of the market  requires a team effort and significant momentum  so we are delighted to be working with AstraZeneca in this important field of medicine.”Regina Fritsche Danielson  SVP and Head of Research and Early Development  Cardiovascular  Renal and Metabolism  at AstraZeneca said:“Our ongoing collaboration with BenevolentAI has been instrumental in uncovering new insights into complex diseases such as CKD and Heart Failure. This shared expertise  combined with the power of AI  has the potential to identify the right therapeutic targets for patients with heart failure and help deliver the next generation of innovative therapies.”About BenevolentAIAt BenevolentAI (AMS: BAI)  we serve patients by leveraging our proprietary and validated Benevolent Platform™ that integrates AI and science to uncover new biology  predict novel targets and develop first-in-class or best-in-class drugs for complex diseases.

The transactions were mainly lease renewals and extensions at Europlaza and Arcs de Seine  as well as the arrival of a first-time tenant at Rives de Bercy  less than three months after completion of the Charenton-le-Pont campus. A lease for a fixed six-year term on 5 600 sq.m of space at Rives de Bercy – almost 20% of the property – has been signed with a major French industry player. The new tenant began preparing the property for their move in March  aiming to welcome its teams in the third quarter of 2024.The occupancy rate of buildings in operation was 82% at March 31  2024  and 69% including the 31 000 sq.m Rives de Bercy campus  delivered at the end of 2023._________________________________1 The property portfolio is divided into buildings in use and assets undergoing repositioning. The delivery of Rives de Bercy at the end of 2023 brings the total number of buildings in use to four. As from January 1  2024  only Office Kennedy and Passy Kennedy are vacant and undergoing redevelopment work.Key figuresVitura’s IFRS rental income was €10.9 million for the three months ended March 31  2024  compared with €12.7 million for the same period in 2023. The positive impact from recently signed leases and index-linked rent increases was offset by the impact of tenants leaving in 2023  particularly at Passy Kennedy and Office Kennedy  which were vacated in view of the project to combine the two buildings within a single 34 000 sq.m complex. The complex  located in Paris' extended CBD with wide views over the Seine  will offer a broad range of upscale amenities – food services  a gym  wellness and social areas  and facilities encouraging low-carbon mobility – and meet the highest environmental standards. Vitura has already obtained a building permit for this ambitious project. The new financing (debt and capital) will cover the works program  the refinancing of the two outstanding loans  and financing costs. The maturity of the €140 million debt for the Passy Kennedy building has been extended to June 30  2024 so that an agreement can be reached on this new financing.The Universal Registration Document comprising the 2023 annual financial report was filed with the French financial markets authority (Autorité des marchés financiers – AMF) on April 29  2024 and is available on Vitura's website.Investor CalendarJune 19  2024: General Shareholders’ MeetingAbout VituraCreated in 2006  Vitura is a listed real estate company (“SIIC”) that invests in prime office properties in Paris and Greater Paris.

(NASDAQ: VEON  Euronext Amsterdam: VEON)  a global digital operator that provides converged connectivity and online services  is delighted to announce that it has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Beeline Kazakhstan  the GSMA and the Barcelona Supercomputing Center - Centro Nacional de Supercomputacion (BSC-CNS) to explore collaboration on the development of artificial intelligence and language technologies for languages with low digital resources.The parties will explore collaboration opportunities focusing on the development of mechanisms and documentation on language models and AI systems for under-resourced languages  including the local languages of the countries where VEON operates.The MoU was signed by the four parties during M360 Eurasia. The event  opening in Baku today  welcomes global connectivity leaders and policymakers for two days of discussion  debate and networking.Out of nearly 7000 languages spoken around the globe  only seven are considered high-resource languages in the digital world: English  Spanish  French  Mandarin  Arabic  German and Japanese. The lack of resources in other languages results in an AI language gap which leads to sub-optimal user experience in AI applications  deepens the bias in AI models and risks deepening the digital divide in AI technologies.Catalan is spoken by 10 million people  spread across various parts of Spain and other areas of Europe  such as Andorra and Alghero. For this reason  the BSC Language Technologies unit has as a priority generating digital resources to guarantee the presence of Catalan in the digital world  while making these resources useful for other languages with the same objective.Operating in countries that are home to 7% of the global population that mostly speak under-sourced languages  VEON is committed to addressing the AI language gap by supporting the usage of low-resource languages in AI  starting with Kazakhstan where Beeline Kazakhstan’s IT subsidiary QazCode already launched Kaz-RoBERTA-conversational – a Kazakh-language AI module supporting customer service in Beeline Kazakhstan’s digital applications.“Artificial Intelligence is the next game changer in the history of technology  and it is in our hands to design and develop it in a way that promotes inclusion for all. Enabling low-resource languages to be a part of the world of AI empowers hundreds of millions of people around the globe by addressing the current shortcomings of the AI landscape. We are delighted to be the first operator group to partner with Barcelona Supercomputing Center and the GSMA to explore opportunities to raise to this challenge.” said Kaan Terzioglu  Group CEO of VEON.“Beeline Kazakhstan is the leading operator in AI technologies in the markets where VEON operates. Having previously developed AI-based solutions in Kazakh language  Beeline Kazakhstan and Qazcode are well aware of the challenges and opportunities that come with Kazakhstan’s transformation into the age of AI. We are extremely excited to partner with Barcelona Supercomputing Center and the GSMA  bringing international experience to our journey of developing new use cases for Kazakh-language AI applications.” said Evgeny Nastradin  CEO of Beeline Kazakhstan.“The development of artificial intelligence also generates gaps between languages. It is important to close them. For this reason  we are making our knowledge and resources available. The work through the Aina Alliance keeps growing and has allowed us to sign a strategic agreement with the GSMA. This is one more step for making our open-source AI expertise accessible to the international community. BSC has published a wide-range number of datasets and open-source models through the Aina project  leading the path into the open-source AI resources availability.”said Mateo Valero Cortes  Director of the BSC-CNS.“The project with VEON and Beeline Kazakhstan is the first on our exciting journey with the BSC. We now call on industry to join us and work together to reduce the disparity in developing and applying AI technologies across different languages. This disparity exacerbates the AI language gap  and the challenges that come with it  including siloed innovation and widening the digital divide. The Aina Alliance aims to ensure that no language is left behind as the world advances into an increasingly AI-driven future.” said Alex Sinclair  Chief Technology Officer of the GSMA.Key to the partnership will be the GSMA Foundry innovation accelerator  an initiative that brings together mobile operators and the wider technology industry  to help members forge the digital future by rapidly developing real-world solutions to industry challenges.Cooperation will take place within the scope of Aina Alliance  a collaboration between the Government of Catalonia and the GSMA  which builds on the Aina Project promoted and financed by the Government of Catalonia  and which seeks to support the presence of non-global languages in artificial intelligence models  enabling speakers of all languages to participate fully in the evolution of the digital world. VEON is the first pilot in the partnership  with the Aina Alliance now inviting other mobile operator partners and organisations to take part in addressing the AI Language gap through collaborative effort.About Barcelona Supercomputing Center - Centro Nacional de SupercomputacionBarcelona Supercomputing Center-Centro Nacional de Supercomputación (BSC-CNS) is the national supercomputing centre in Spain.

Indeed  we have successfully refocused our clinical programs to indications of high medical needs to provide a therapeutic alternative mainly to patients with severe and resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections  often associated with high mortality and strong impact on healthcare budgets.This is particularly the case for Prosthetic Joint Infections  where PHAXIAM plans to strengthen its leading competitive position through an upcoming first global Phase 2 study  but also for Endocarditis Infections  with the beginning  a couple of weeks ago  of a unique Phase 1 study in this indication with phage therapy.Beyond these two strategic clinical studies  our technological platform and know-how enable us to evaluate our phages in additional indications  such as Diabetic Food Ulcer caused by S. aureus  and potentially later  Urinary Tract Severe Infections caused by E. coli  reinforcing our ambition to develop a unique portfolio of innovative therapies for patients who failed traditional antimicrobial treatments.”BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTSa) Important progress for the Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) programProsthetic Joint Infections (PJI)PHAXIAM is accelerating its PJI clinical development efforts through active preparations of a global Phase 2 proof-of-concept (POC) study. The Phase 2 POC study is intended to be a multicentric  randomized  double-blind trial and is expected to include 100 patients in Europe and the US. PHAXIAM confirms its objective to file a Clinical Trial Application (CTA) with the EMA and the FDA in 3Q 2024 in view of starting patient enrollment in early 2025. The Company intends to capitalize on promising activity signals from real-life compassionate treatments and valuable insights from the PhagoDAIR pilot study  the data of which should be available by the end of 2024.Endocarditis Infections (EI)PHAXIAM has recently initiated the enrolment of a phase 1 study (pharmacokinetic (PK) data) in Endocarditis Infections caused by S. aureus  its second sponsored clinical trial  to evaluate the safety of intravenous administration (IV) of its anti-S. aureus phages. Preliminary clinical results are expected in 2H 2024.b) Complementary clinical trials and programs to confirm the versatility and the value of PHAXIAM’s phage-platformDiabetic Foot Ulcer (DFU): Phase 2 (POC) Investigator-Sponsored TrialThis clinical study is targeting DFU infections due to mono-bacterial S. aureus infection in 60 diabetic patients to be enrolled across 10 French hospitals.Escherichia coli (E. coli) program: Phase 1 PK Trial Targeting patients having failed traditional antimicrobial treatment in complex mono-bacterial E. coli infections in the urinary tract due to neurogenic bladder. PHAXIAM has received the validation from the ANSM (French Regulatory agency) to initiate this sponsored clinical trial in France  subject to available financing.These complementary clinical studies are the opportunity to bring additional clinical POC data in other high-value indications.1Q 2024 FINANCIAL INFORMATIONAs of March 31  2024  PHAXIAM had cash and cash equivalents totaling €5.8 million  compared with €10.5 million as of December 31  2023. The €4.5 million decrease in cash position during the first quarter of 2024 was reflecting the R&D and regulatory activities from the newly integrated PHAXIAM team to advance the company’s pipeline  mostly in its S. aureus program.The current cash position can fund PHAXIAM’s programs and planned operating expenses into August 2024.

Additionally  the Company will receive tiered royalties on net sales of any commercialised products.Heart Failure is a complex syndrome which occurs when the heart cannot pump enough blood around the body. It is often complicated by multiple interrelated diseases  so requires a deep understanding of the potential disease drivers in individual patients. Current heart failure treatments follow a one-size-fits-all approach. However  due to the wide range of mechanisms by which heart failure can occur  there remains an unmet need for new therapies as up to 50% of patients die within five years of diagnosis.here or remove ads . 3rd party Ad.

Coordinator Investigator of the ACTISAVE study  presented the main results of the study during the opening session of the conference ""Official welcome & Large Clinical Trial"": ""ACTISAVE Clinical Trial: Efficacy and Safety of Glenzocimab on Top of Thrombolysis with or without Mechanical Thrombectomy."" He also highlighted the differences between the ACTIMIS and ACTISAVE studies in terms of patient population.Dr. Martin Köhrmann  M.D.  PhD.  Coordinator Investigator of the ACTISAVE study  stated: ""The analysis of the phase 2/3 ACTISAVE study in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke did not demonstrate  in the overall population  the efficacy of glenzocimab on the primary endpoint  the proportion of patients with severe disability or death (mRS 4-6) 90 days after stroke  nor on the secondary endpoint  the proportion of patients returning to life without disability (mRS 0-2). However  a trend was observed in the proportion of patients returning to normal life (mRS 0-1)  especially for patients with complete recanalization after thrombectomy (eTICI score 3). These data encourage us to search for patient subpopulations among whom an advantage of glenzocimab may be demonstrated  as its favorable safety profile remains confirmed in this study.""Gilles Avenard  Chief Executive Officer  developed: ""We are faced with results that challenge our initial expectations  but the further analysis of the study data on certain subgroups is promising. Glenzocimab has shown beneficial effects in certain patient subgroups that warrant further exploration  allowing us to consider continuing discussions with the pharmaceutical groups with whom we are in contact. These data encourage us to refine and potentially redefine the positioning of glenzocimab in the treatment of strokes.""During this conference  in the ""Hyperacute Management"" session on Wednesday  May 15th  Dr. Davide Carone from Brainomix Ltd will also present the latest brain imaging analyses obtained in the ACTIMIS study: ""Patients randomized to Glenzocimab suffered less hemorrhagic transformation with greater benefit in larger baseline infarct core "" reinforcing the potential of glenzocimab in certain patient subpopulations  particularly those presenting larger volumes of cerebral infarction at baseline.Glenzocimab is also being evaluated in two other clinical studies conducted by academic teams  which do not question their work and confirm their confidence in the potential of the product.Phase 2/3 GREEN study in the treatment of stroke in patients undergoing mechanical thrombectomy with a futility analysis after the inclusion of the first 78 patients (30% of patients) expected in the fourth quarter of 2024;Phase 2b LIBERATE study in the treatment of myocardial infarction with final results expected in the fourth quarter of 2025.The company plans to actively continue discussions with pharmaceutical partners to explore potential strategic collaborations that could support future phases of glenzocimab's development and clinical application.As announced on April 25  2024  during the release of the ACTISAVE results  the company is able to fund its operations until October 2024.About ESOCThe European Stroke Organisation (ESO) is a pan-European society of researchers and physicians specializing in strokes  national and regional stroke societies  and non-professional organizations  founded in December 2007. ESO is a non-governmental organization composed of individual and organizational members. ESO serves as the voice of stroke in Europe  harmonizing stroke care across Europe and taking action to reduce the burden of stroke at regional and global levels.The 10th European Stroke Organisation Conference took place on May 15th  16th  and 17th  2024  in Basel.About ACTICOR BIOTECHActicor Biotech is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing glenzocimab  an innovative drug for the treatment of cardiovascular emergencies  particularly ischemic stroke.Positive results from the phase 1b/2a study  ACTIMIS  published in January 2024 in the Lancet Neurology (link to publication) confirmed the safety profile of glenzocimab and showed a reduction in mortality and intracerebral haemorrhage in the glenzocimab-treated group of stroke patients. A post-hoc analysis of brain imaging at 0 and 24 hours using artificial intelligence confirmed these results  showing a reduction in the number and volume of intracerebral lesions in patients treated with glenzocimab.On April 25  2024  the company announced the initial results of the ACTISAVE trial (NCT05070260)  an international phase 2/3 study in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke  which showed no efficacy of glenzocimab on the primary endpoint  the proportion of patients with severe disability or death (mRS 4-6) 90 days after stroke  nor on the secondary endpoint  the proportion of patients returning to life without disability (mRS 0-2) 90 days after stroke.ACTISAVE (NCT05070260)  an international  adaptive  multicenter  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled  parallel-group Phase 2/3 study  evaluated the safety and efficacy of a single dose of glenzocimab used in combination with the standard of care (thrombolysis +/- thrombectomy) for acute ischemic stroke. The study was deployed in the United States  Europe (8 countries)  Israel and the United Kingdom.Acticor Biotech is currently investigating any influencing factors that may have accounted for these results  which contradict the findings of pharmacology studies and previous clinical data.Acticor Biotech is backed by a panel of European and international investors (Mediolanum farmaceutici  Karista  Go Capital  Newton Biocapital  CMS Medical Venture Investment (HK) Limited  A&B (HK) Limited  Anaxago  and the Armesa Foundation) and has been listed on Euronext Growth Paris since November 2021 (ISIN: FR0014005OJ5 - ALACT).For further information  please visit: https://www.acticor-biotech.com/View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240515314114/en/",neutral,0.01,0.98,0.01,positive,0.76,0.22,0.01,True,English,"['Phase 2/3 ACTISAVE Study', 'ACTICOR BIOTECH', 'Main Results', 'Presentation', 'Treatment', 'Stroke', 'ESOC', '10th European Stroke Organisation Conference', 'Professor Martin Köhrmann', 'Dr. Martin Köhrmann', 'phase 2b LIBERATE studies', 'two other clinical studies', 'The European Stroke Organisation', 'latest brain imaging analyses', 'Phase 2b LIBERATE study', 'larger baseline infarct core', 'clinical stage biopharmaceutical company', 'Phase 2/3 GREEN study', 'phase 2/3 study results', 'Dr. Davide Carone', 'Large Clinical Trial', 'new perspectives Continued', 'Chief Executive Officer', 'less hemorrhagic transformation', 'phase 1b/2a study', 'clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company', 'ACTISAVE Clinical Trial', 'Hyperacute Management"" session', '2/3 ACTISAVE study', 'acute ischemic stroke', 'potential strategic collaborations', 'favorable safety profile', 'regional stroke societies', 'ACTISAVE studies', 'clinical application', 'larger volumes', 'stroke care', 'opening session', 'ACTISAVE results', 'Regulatory News', 'ACTICOR BIOTECH', 'innovative drug', 'cardiovascular emergencies', 'M.D.', 'Coordinator Investigator', 'main results', 'Official welcome', 'patient population', 'overall population', 'primary endpoint', 'secondary endpoint', 'complete recanalization', 'eTICI score', 'patient subpopulations', 'Gilles Avenard', 'initial expectations', 'beneficial effects', 'pharmaceutical groups', 'May 15th', 'Brainomix Ltd', 'greater benefit', 'cerebral infarction', 'academic teams', 'fourth quarter', 'myocardial infarction', 'final results', 'pharmaceutical partners', 'future phases', 'pan-European society', 'non-professional organizations', 'non-governmental organization', 'organizational members', 'global levels', 'Positive results', 'Lancet Neurology', 'intracerebral haemorrhage', 'glenzocimab-treated group', 'artificial intelligence', 'ACTIMIS study', 'study data', 'specific subgroups', 'Mechanical Thrombectomy', 'patient subgroups', 'stroke patients', 'severe disability', 'normal life', 'continuing discussions', 'futility analysis', 'post-hoc analysis', 'first 78 patients', 'way', 'commitment', 'ISIN', 'FR0014005OJ5', 'ALACT', 'Paris', 'treatment', 'presentation', 'Wednesday', 'ESOC', 'occasion', 'PhD.', 'Efficacy', 'Top', 'Thrombolysis', 'differences', 'terms', 'proportion', 'death', 'mRS', 'trend', 'advantage', 'exploration', 'contact', 'positioning', 'strokes', 'work', 'confidence', 'product', 'inclusion', 'development', 'April', 'release', 'operations', 'October', 'researchers', 'physicians', 'national', 'December', 'individual', 'voice', 'action', 'burden', 'place', '16th', 'January', 'link', 'publication', 'reduction', 'mortality', '24 hours', 'number']",2024-05-15,2024-05-16,marketscreener.com

Remarkably  this response was achieved at a very low dose of AB8939  corresponding to the second step of dose increment (out of 13 potential steps) in phase I. The patient also showed good tolerance to AB8939  having experienced no treatment-related toxicities. At the request of the investigator  AB Science has authorized further treatment cycles of AB8939 to this patient. One month after the second treatment cycle of three consecutive days at this dose  a good response has been maintained with bone marrow blasts being at 10% (corresponding to a 5-fold reduction relative to baseline).

See disclosureorAB Science wants to focus the majority of our clinical resources on the development of rare diseases with masitinib  on the development of the microtubule platform with AB8939 and future molecules of the same family due to the very encouraging first results.Seeking of license for masitinibThis license search is a priority in the Company's strategy  given the number of clinical studies already conducted and the maturity of the pipeline  and given the additional investments required to complete the clinical program  up to market authorizations. We want to highlight that the duration of this license search is not predictable and that the realization of a license is dependent on a number of factors and is not guaranteed. However  the milestones reached at this stage are essential factors that contribute to the feasibility of this strategy.As a result of the focus strategy  AB Science has decided to adapt its organization  which lead to a significant reduction in costs. AB Science has therefore implemented a redundancy plan.Renewal of the Programme d'Augmentation de Capital Ã Terme (PACT) concluded with Alpha Blue Ocean and subscription by Alpha Blue Ocean of a tranche of one million sharesAlpha Blue Ocean is committed to subscribe  from April 28  2023  to newly issued shares of AB Science (in tranches comprised of a number of shares between 500 000 and 1 million) over a period of 24 months  up to a maximum of 4.0 million shares in total (or 7.2% of the company's share capital on the basis of the capital after the capital increase announced on 24 April 2023).here or remove ads . 3rd party Ad.

See disclosureorThe Board of Directors of AB Science decided to draw down one million shares under this programme  on the basis of the 17th resolution of the Combined General Meeting of shareholders of 30 June 2023 (reserved cash capital increase with cancellation of preferential subscription rights). They were subscribed by Alpha Blue Ocean at the end of March 2024 at a price of €2.5701 (i.e. the volume-weighted average price of AB Science shares on Euronext Paris over the three trading sessions preceding the drawdown request). AB Science received all the proceeds from the issue of the shares subscribed by Alpha Blue Ocean  and 80% of these proceeds were then placed in an escrow account. Alpha Blue Ocean is now responsible for the orderly sale of the AB Science shares subscribed for. 95% of the sale proceeds (less a structuring fee) will be paid monthly to AB Science  either directly by Alpha Blue Ocean or by drawing on the escrow account referred to above  after deduction of the 20% advance on the issue proceeds retained by AB Science.Following this drawdown and the corresponding capital increase  the company's share capital amounted to €588 662.03  made up of 52 071 069 ordinary shares with a par value of €0.01 each (and 58 866 203 including all categories of shares).

This procedure continued in 2023.In January 2024  AB Science announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) had proposed that AB Science respond in writing to the outstanding questions at D195 of the procedure  instead of addressing these questions at the Oral Explanation. AB Science accepted this proposal. A new Oral Explanation is not mandatory and will only be scheduled if major objections remain after the review of the written responses.AB Science now expects an opinion from the CHMP before the end of the second quarter of 2024.Continuation of the Notice of Compliance with Conditions procedure with Health Canada for masitinib in the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)In February 2022  AB Science announced that it had submitted a conditional marketing authorization application to Health Canada for masitinib in the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). This procedure continued in 2023.AB Science announced in February 2024 that Health Canada had issued a Notice of Deficiency-Withdrawal (NOD/w) regarding the submission file for masitinib in the treatment of ALS and indicated its intention to file a request for reconsideration of the file.In April 2024  AB Science announced that Health Canada had deemed the request for reconsideration of masitinib eligible. The reconsideration process will re-assess  with new reviewers  the decision on the basis of the data in the initial dossier.Health Canada and AB Science have met to discuss the reconsideration process. AB Science is working closely with the Agency to facilitate the review of the conditional approval of masitinib in ALS.First complete bone marrow response in an acute myeloid leukemia patient in its AB8939 Phase I/II clinical trialAB Science announced in March 2023 a case report from the initial stage of its Phase I/II study (AB18001) evaluating AB8939  a microtubule destabilizer  in patients with refractory and relapsed acute myeloid leukemia (AML).The AML patient in question was in failure to prior treatment with azacitidine and presented with a MECOM gene rearrangement  which is a biomarker for resistance to standard chemotherapies that is associated with a high-risk of disease progression and inferior prognosis.One month after the first treatment cycle (i.e.  three consecutive days of AB8939 treatment) there was a drastic reduction in bone marrow blast cells (i.e.  leukemia cells)  from a pretreatment level of 55% to 5% (i.e.  a morphologic leukemia free state). Remarkably  this response was achieved at a very low dose of AB8939  corresponding to the second step of dose increment (out of 13 potential steps) in phase I. The patient also showed good tolerance to AB8939  having experienced no treatment-related toxicities. At the request of the investigator  AB Science has authorized further treatment cycles of AB8939 to this patient. One month after the second treatment cycle of three consecutive days at this dose  a good response has been maintained with bone marrow blasts being at 10% (corresponding to a 5-fold reduction relative to baseline). A third treatment cycle for this patient has been initiated.New clinical development program for masitinib in sickle cell disease  among the winning projects to be funded under the sixth call for ""Hospital-University Research in Health"" (Recherche Hospitalo-Universitaire en santé) projects  part of the Future Investments ProgramAB Science announced that a new clinical development program for masitinib in sickle cell disease is among the winning projects to be funded under the sixth call for ""Hospital-University Research in Health"" (Recherche Hospitalo-Universitaire en santé) projects  which is part of the Future Investments Program.The ""Hospital-University Research in Health"" (RHU) call for projects of the Future Investments Program  operated by the National Research Agency  aims to support innovative and large-scale research projects in the field of health. Focused on translational research  i.e.  converting results in basic research into results that directly benefit humans  RHU projects involve academic  hospital  and business stakeholders.As part of this call for projects  the SICKMAST project  funded with 9.2 million euros  aims to:First  identify and validate  from a database of 1500 patients (including 700 already identified)  biomarkers highlighting the role of mast cells and basophils in orchestrating acute and chronic complications of sickle cell disease.Second  demonstrate in a phase 2 clinical trial the efficacy of masitinib in the treatment of acute and chronic complications of sickle cell disease in patients identified based on biomarkers.The Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP) will be the promoter of these phase 2 studies. AB Science will mainly be involved in supplying masitinib and monitoring masitinib pharmacovigilance data. AB Science remains free to carry out  as it sees fit  any potential phase 3 development following the success of phase 2.A new patent has been filed  which  if granted  will extend the international protection of masitinib in sickle cell disease until 2040. As part of the consortium agreement established for its patents  AB Science will pay royalties to AP-HP in the event of commercialization of masitinib in sickle cell disease.Strengthening of intellectual property protection for masitinib in ALS  mastocytosis and prostate cancerIn ALS  AB Science announced that announced that the patent Office of Japan and the patent Office of Canada and have issued a Notice of Allowance (NOA) for a patent relating to methods of treating amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) with its lead compound masitinib. These new patents provide strong protection for masitinib in the treatment of ALS until 2037 and completes the IP coverage for ALS across all key geographic areas where masitinib could be marketed.In mastocytosis  AB Science announced that the European Patent Office has issued a Notice of Allowance for a patent relating to methods of treating severe systemic mastocytosis (i.e. a medical use patent) with masitinib. This new European patent provides intellectual property protection for masitinib in this indication until October 2036.In prostate cancer  AB Science announced that the European Patent Office has issued a Notice of Allowance for a patent relating to methods of treating (mCRPC) with masitinib  based on findings from study AB12003. This new European patent provides intellectual property protection for masitinib in the treatment of mCRPC until 2042.The same medical use patent strategy is being pursued in other indications such as multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer’s disease for protection until 2041.CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION FOR THE YEAR 2023The operating result as of 31 December 2023 was a loss of €13 429k  compared with a loss of €15 937k as of 31 December 2022  a decrease in the operating loss of €2 508k (15.7%).Operating income  exclusively made up of revenues related to the operation of a drug in veterinary medicine  amounted to €970k as of 31 December 2023  compared to €958k a year earlier.Operating expenses decreased by 14.8% between the years ended 31 December 2023 and 2022. This decrease is mainly due to lower research and development costs (down 21.5%).Marketing expenses were stable compared to 31 December 2022  rising from €480k as of 31 December 2022 to €522k as of 31 December 2023.Administrative expenses were stable compared to 31 December 2022  decreasing from €3 040k as of 31 December 2022 to €3 017k as of 31 December 2023.Research and development costs decreased by €2 868k  or 21.5%  from €13 3453k as of 31 December 2022 to €10 477k as of 31 December 2023.Net financial income for the years ended 31 December 2022 and 31 December 2023 was €2 326k and €3 382k respectively. In 2023  as in 2022  this financial result has no cash impact. The financial result of €3 382k includes income of €4 169k (versus €3 165k in 2022) resulting from the valuation of these financial instruments  and a financial expense of €1 598k (versus €1 510k in 2022)  of which €941k corresponds to the provision for capitalised interest relating to the loan with the EIB.The consolidated net loss as of 31 December 2023 is €10 048k compared to a loss of €13 615k as of 31 December 2022  a decrease of 26.2%.The following table summarizes the consolidated financial statements for the year 2023 prepared in accordance with IFRS  and comparative information with the year 2022:In thousands of euros  except for share data 31/12/2023 31/12/2022 Net turnover 970 958 Cost of sales (383) (31) Marketing expenses (522) (480) Administrative expenses (3 017) (3 040) Research and development expenses (10 477) (13 345) Operating income (13 429) (15 937) Financial income 5 962 4 904 Financier expenses (2 580) (2 578) Financial income 3 382 2 326 Net income (10 048) (13 615) Total comprehensive income for the period (9 791) (13 356) Basic earnings per share - in euros (0 20) (0 29) Diluted earnings per share - in euros (0 20) (0 29)In thousands of euros 31/12/2023 31/12/2022 Cash and cash equivalents 6 066 7 269 Total Assets 25 499 23 841 Equity (21 010) (35 670) Non-current liabilities 27 825 36 432 Trade payables 11 075 12 248 Current liabilities 18 683 23 079OTHER CORPORATE INFORMATION FOR YEAR 2023 AND SINCE DECEMBER 31  2023Clinical development strategy based on two platforms: the late-stage masitinib clinical phase 3 platform and the new microtubule platform in clinical Phase 1In April 2023  AB Science announced its decision to focus its development strategy as follows:Allocation of current resources primarily to the development of masitinib for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and the development of the microtubule destabilizer agents (MDA) platform  with the clinical development of AB8939 in refractory acute myeloid leukemia and the initiation of regulatory preclinical development of a new oral molecule in the same microtubule class for sarcoma and solid tumors.AB Science wants to focus the majority of our clinical resources on the development of rare diseases with masitinib  on the development of the microtubule platform with AB8939 and future molecules of the same family due to the very encouraging first results.Seeking of license for masitinibThis license search is a priority in the Company's strategy  given the number of clinical studies already conducted and the maturity of the pipeline  and given the additional investments required to complete the clinical program  up to market authorizations. We want to highlight that the duration of this license search is not predictable and that the realization of a license is dependent on a number of factors and is not guaranteed. However  the milestones reached at this stage are essential factors that contribute to the feasibility of this strategy.As a result of the focus strategy  AB Science has decided to adapt its organization  which lead to a significant reduction in costs. AB Science has therefore implemented a redundancy plan.Renewal of the Programme d’Augmentation de Capital à Terme (PACT) concluded with Alpha Blue Ocean and subscription by Alpha Blue Ocean of a tranche of one million sharesAlpha Blue Ocean is committed to subscribe  from April 28  2023  to newly issued shares of AB Science (in tranches comprised of a number of shares between 500 000 and 1 million) over a period of 24 months  up to a maximum of 4.0 million shares in total (or 7.2% of the company’s share capital on the basis of the capital after the capital increase announced on 24 April 2023).The Board of Directors of AB Science decided to draw down one million shares under this programme  on the basis of the 17th resolution of the Combined General Meeting of shareholders of 30 June 2023 (reserved cash capital increase with cancellation of preferential subscription rights). They were subscribed by Alpha Blue Ocean at the end of March 2024 at a price of €2.5701 (i.e. the volume-weighted average price of AB Science shares on Euronext Paris over the three trading sessions preceding the drawdown request). AB Science received all the proceeds from the issue of the shares subscribed by Alpha Blue Ocean  and 80% of these proceeds were then placed in an escrow account. Alpha Blue Ocean is now responsible for the orderly sale of the AB Science shares subscribed for. 95% of the sale proceeds (less a structuring fee) will be paid monthly to AB Science  either directly by Alpha Blue Ocean or by drawing on the escrow account referred to above  after deduction of the 20% advance on the issue proceeds retained by AB Science.Following this drawdown and the corresponding capital increase  the company's share capital amounted to €588 662.03  made up of 52 071 069 ordinary shares with a par value of €0.01 each (and 58 866 203 including all categories of shares). By way of illustration  a shareholder holding 1% of the company's share capital (all classes of shares included) before the first tranche of the PACT® programme was drawn down held 0.98% of the company's share capital after the drawdown.PACT featuresFor each tranche  the issuance price of new shares of AB Science  subscribed by Alpha Blue Ocean  shall be equal to 100% of the volume-weighted average price of the shares of AB Science traded on Euronext Paris over the three trading days preceding a tranche drawdown request.For each tranche  and after the settlement-delivery of the new shares of AB Science following the relevant capital increase  80% of the proceeds of the tranche shall be secured in an escrow account with a third-party escrow agent. The remaining balance shall be kept by AB Science.Following predefined trading rules for each tranche  Alpha Blue Ocean shall manage the orderly sale  on or off the market  of the AB Science shares subscribed to. 95% of the proceeds shall be distributed to AB Science on a monthly basis (minus a structuration fee)  directly from Alpha Blue Ocean or by way of a release from the escrow account.AB Science has no obligations to draw down on the PACT and shall utilise this innovative financing solution only if necessary and if the market conditions are favourable to the interests of AB Science and its shareholders.Coverage initiation by DNA Finance and In Extenso FinanceAB Science announced that two financial analysis firms  DNA Finance and In Extenso Finance  have initiated the coverage of the Company.DNA Finance estimates that AB Science stands out as a compelling investment opportunity in the biotech sector.In Extenso has initiated a strong buy opinion on the share.These new coverages aim to strengthen the AB Science visibility among French and international institutional investors and to broaden its investor base. They are in addition to the coverage by Chardan  an investment bank based in the United States and specialized in biotechnologies and health technologies.Partial payments of 2020 and 2021 research tax credit by the tax administrationPartial payments of the 2020 and 2021 research tax credit by the tax administration took place in 2024 for a total amount of €4 942k. The difference between the planned initial amount of research tax credit and the amount paid is currently under discussion with the tax administration.The partial payment of the 2022 research tax credit is expected in the first half of 2024  for an estimated amount of €3 040k.The total or partial payment of the 2023 research tax credit  or its mobilisation  is anticipated in the second half of 2024.Going concern is guaranteed for 12 months  taking into account partial payments of the 2020 and 2021 research tax credit and estimated payments of the 2022 and 2023 research tax credit.Confirmation by the Paris Court of Appeal of the acquittal of the CEO of AB Science  Alain Moussy  and reduction of the amount of the financial penalty imposed on AB ScienceAB Science and the Chairman of the French market regulator (Autorité des Marchés Financiers - AMF) had filed an appeal to the Paris Court of Appeal against the decision of the AMF Sanctions commission  dated March 24  2022  which acquitted Alain Moussy  CEO of AB Science  for an alleged insider trading and sanctioned AB Science for a failure to comply with some of its communication obligations (as part of the assessment of conditions for a deferral of privileged information publication)  as indicated in the AB Science press release of March 29  2022.The Paris Court of Appeal confirmed the fully acquittal of Alain Moussy and reduced by 200 000 euros the amount of the financial penalty pronounced against AB Science. This amount of 200 000 euros will have to be reimbursed by the French Treasury  as AB Science has paid the full financial penalty initially pronounced by the AMF Sanctions commission on March 24  2022.Financial restructuringIn April 2023  AMY S.A.S and Alain Moussy (majority shareholders)  AB Science and the minority shareholder entities (including in particular the convertible bondholders  the Tax Research Credit lenders and the APDC holders) signed an Agreement relating to:the implementation of AB Science's new strategy the financing of AB Science andthe restructuring of AB Science's bond debt and Class C preference shares.Restructuring of convertible bonds issued in February 2022 and Class C preferred sharesAB Science announced on 21 April 2023 the negotiation of a framework agreement under which the terms and conditions of the bond issue agreement (entered into with the holders of the US$8.5 million convertible bonds issued in February 2022 and to which 50 000 warrants were attached with an exercise price of 000 warrants with an exercise price of EUR 12.65) would be amended to provide  on 15 July 2023 and automatically  for the conversion of all the convertible bonds into ordinary shares of AB Science on the basis of a price per share of EUR 5.75 (i.e. the subscription price of the New Shares).The framework agreement has also been negotiated with the holders of Class C preferred shares (the “C Preferred”). It provides the C Preferred still in circulation to be repurchased by AB Science for one symbolic euro (and subsequently cancelled)  which was done in March 2024. 520 786 share warrants (each warrant entitling the holder to subscribe for one ordinary share of AB Science at par value for a period of 12 months) will be issued in substitution of the C Preferred. In addition  still in substitution of the C Preferred  it provides a new class of preferred shares to be created  benefiting from priority dividend rights (equal to 1.25% of the net sales of masitinib or of any licensing royalties  up to a limit of 9.0 million euros) and convertible into 750 000 ordinary shares of AB Science if the share price of AB Science exceeds a threshold of 30 euros for more than 90 consecutive days.Finally  it has been proposed to the shareholders to extend the term of certain lines of warrants already issued  to adapt to the evolution of AB Science’s strategy and of its clinical pipeline.Capital increase for an amount of 15 million eurosAB Science announced on April 24  2023 the success of its capital increase through the issuance of new ordinary shares with attached warrants  with a waiver of preferential subscription rights.The Capital Increase consisted of a private placement pursuant to Articles L. 225-136 of the French Commercial Code and L. 411-2 1° of the French Monetary and Financial Code and has been carried out with a waiver of preferential subscription rights  pursuant to the delegation of authority granted to the Board of Directors under the 20th resolution of the Combined General Shareholders’ Meeting of June 29  2022. The Capital Increase has taken the form of the issuance of 2 608 686 actions new ordinary shares (the “New Shares”) to each of which are attached a share subscription warrant (the “Warrants”).The Capital Increase was made through a cash contribution of approximately EUR 11.5 million and by offsetting existing receivables  i.e. approximately EUR 3.0 million (receivables related to the pre-financing of the research tax credit for the 2020 financial year and maturing in 2023  as well as approximately EUR 500 000 in interest accrued to date on the convertible bonds issued in February 2022).Two warrants giving the right to subscribe to one ordinary share  all of the 2 608 686 New Shares and all of the 1 304 343 new shares that would be issued upon exercise of the warrants  i.e. a total of 3 913 029 shares in the Company  represent 7.36% of the Company's current share capital. The issue price of the New Shares has been set at 5.75 euros (0.01 euro par value and 5.74 euros issue premium) and the exercise price of the Warrants at 8.625 euros  representing a total fundraising of approximately EUR 15.0 million (taking into account the exercise of the warrants  the maximum amount of the Capital Increase could be increased by an amount of 26.3 million euros).The Warrants may be exercised from January 1st  2025 to December 31  2030.Drawdown of the second tranche of €6 million under its financing agreement with the European Investment BankAB Science announced in January 2023 that it has received payment of €6.0 million as the second tranche of a €15 million loan from the European Investment Bank (EIB).The second tranche has a maturity of five years and is therefore repayable in January 2028. It carries a capitalized annual interest rate of 7.0% and the issuance of 115 830 warrants  each giving the right to subscribe to one ordinary share of AB Science at 14.0 euros for 15 years. These warrants represent 0.22% of the current capital of the Company (if they were to be exercised in their entirety).Other eventsOther securities transactionsDuring the year 2023  the following were granted:69 000 share warrants  of which 54 000 were granted to a business finder  and 15 000 to directors105 900 stock-options to an employeeIn September 2023  12 560 free shares (AGAP B') were issued.

The accounting presentation of the revenues of the activities is reported in the annex to the press release.Leasing revenue on owned equipment continues to improve thanks to the growth of the owned fleet and the good utilisation rate of our equipment  with an increase of +13.1% (+€2.2 million).Ancillary services decreased by -€2.0 million  mainly on the chartering activity for the River Barges division. Sale of owned equipment fell by -€0.8 million  particularly on the Containers activity.Management activities remained stable (-€0.1 million)  while the fall in sales fees on second-hand equipment owned by investors (-€0.5 million) was compensated by the increase of syndication fees (+€0.4 million).ANALYSIS OF THE CONTRIBUTION BY DIVISIONRestated Revenue from activities Q1 2024Q1 2023Variation(in € thousand) Leasing revenue on owned equipment 12 234 11 124 1 110 Ancillary services 1 137 1 938 -801 Total leasing activity 13 371 13 062 309 Sales of owned equipment 136 76 60 Total sales of equipment 136 76 60 Total of owned activity 13 507 13 138 369 Syndication fees 188 0 188 Management fees 558 538 20 Total of management activity 746 538 208 Total Freight railcars 14 253 13 676 577 Leasing revenue on owned equipment 1 749 1 878 -129 Ancillary services 1 196 2 072 -876 Total leasing activity 2 945 3 950 -1 005 Sales of owned equipment 1 0 1 Total sales of equipment 1 0 1 Total of owned activity 2 946 3 950 -1 004 Management fees 32 11 21 Total of management activity 32 11 21 Total River Barges 2 978 3 961 -983 Leasing revenue on owned equipment 5 393 4 133 1 260 Ancillary services 688 1 021 -333 Total leasing activity 6 081 5 154 927 Sales of owned equipment 8 955 10 211 -1 256 Total sales of equipment 8 955 10 211 -1 256 Total of owned activity 15 036 15 365 -329 Syndication fees 236 0 236 Management fees 425 472 -47 Sales fees 326 861 -535 Total of management activity 987 1 333 -346 Total Containers 16 023 16 698 -675 Leasing revenue on owned equipment 5 4 1 Total leasing activity 5 4 1 Sales of owned equipment 3 121 2 766 355 Total sales of equipment 3 121 2 766 355 Total of owned activity 3 126 2 770 356 Other capital gains on disposals 0 1 -1 Total Others 0 1 -1 Total Miscellaneous and eliminations 3 126 2 771 355 Total Restated Revenue from activities 36 380 37 106 -726The Freight Railcars business grew by 4.2% (+€0.6 million)  driven by leasing revenues from owned equipment. This increase is explained by the regular investments generating additional revenues  and by maintaining an average utilisation rate of 87% in the 1st quarter of 2024. Management activities also performed well  rising by +€0.2 million with the resumption of syndication transactions.The River Barges activity decreased by -€1.0 million compared with the 1st quarter of 2023. This decrease is due to the slowdown of the ancillary chartering services (with a limited impact on earnings  as the chartering costs decreased at the same time)  and to the average utilisation rate of 92.5% during the quarter (compared with 100% the previous year). However  the utilisation rate returned to 100% at the end of March 2024.Revenues in the Containers division amounted to €16.0 million but decreased by -€0.7 million over the period. In the context of market normalisation since the beginning of 2023  sales of owned containers and ancillary services (pick-up charges) respectively decreased by -€1.3 million and -€0.3 million compared with the 1st quarter 2023. Contrary  leasing revenue on owned equipment rose by +€1.3 million driven by an average utilisation rate of 96.7% during the quarter (compared with 95.1% for the full year 2023).Management activities fell by -€0.3 million  due to a slight decline in sale fees on investor equipment.The Modular Buildings  accounted in the ""Miscellaneous"" line  has been continuing to perform well since 2023  showing a net increase of +€0.4 million (+13%). The coming year looks good  with a high order backlog.OUTLOOKThe normalisation of the container traffic ended early 2024  and the container trade expressed in TEU-miles is now expected to rise by +9.2% over the year (or +4.1% if the “Red Sea effect” is adjusted)  according to Clarkson forecasts dated April 2024. This rebound should lead to an increase in leasing demand.

SATISFACTORY OUTLOOK FOR THE NEW FISCAL YEAR 2024-25.Q4 fiscal sales remained buoyant despite a sluggish consumer environment. As expected  Q4 23-24 sales were down at €6.39m vs. €7.49m in 22-23.The drop in sales was mainly due to the non-renewal of a branded robot sale for Mainbot  and to a lesser extent to a drop in sales on Amazon in a context of post-Christmas inventory rationalization.Over the full fiscal year  sales rose by a further 14.36% to €58.55M  compared with €51.2M a year earlier.The Group continued its communications campaign in Europe during the quarter  exceeding one billion digital impressions over its fiscal year. The Group also invested more than 1 million euros in digital advertising on the American market to raise brand awareness locally.Q1 24-25 is expected to be slightly up on Q1 23-24  and augurs another year of profitable growth for Lexibook  despite a less favorable euro/US dollar exchange rate and deteriorating international freight conditions.Lexibook (ISIN FR0000033599) today announced its sales (unaudited) for the period ending March 31  2024 (period from April 1er 2023 to March 31  2024).Consolidated sales (M€) 2022/2023 2023/2024 Var 1er quarter 6 93 7 01 +1 15% Of which FOB 2 22 2 21 -0 45% Of which Non FOB 4 71 4 8 +1 91% 2éme quarter 13 4 15 13 +12 91% Of which FOB 4 32 2 85 -34 03% Of which Non FOB 9 08 12 28 +35 24% 3rd quarter 23 41 30 01 +28 19% Of which FOB 0 72 0 88 +22 22% Of which Non FOB 22 69 29 13 +28 38% 4éme quarter 7 49 6 39 -14 69% Of which FOB 1 87 1 03 -44 92% Of which Non FOB 5 62 5 35 -4 80% +14 36%Total 12 months 51 2 58 55After a very dynamic third quarter of FY23-24  with growth of 28.2%  the last quarter of the fiscal year  which was already down by 11.3% in FY22-23  was  as expected  down again  to €6.39M vs. €7.49M in FY22-23 (-14.7%). This drop in activity is essentially due to the non-renewal of a robot delivery for Mainbot  and to a lesser extent by a lower level of orders from Amazon Europe as a result of their inventory rationalization policy after the Christmas season. FOB sales (sales invoiced directly from HK on FOB HK deliveries by full containers) fell sharply by 45%  as the sale to Mainbot took place on an FOB HK basis in Q1 2023. Non-FOB sales were down slightly  mainly due to Amazon Europe.Over the full year  sales rose by 14.4% to €58.55 million  a record level for the Group.In terms of products  the decline in sales over the quarter was concentrated on Mainbot robots. Sales of other products showed little change in proportion to the quarter's activity.Sales of licensed products remained buoyant over the quarter  both for existing licenses such as Snow Queen  Pat Patrol and Spiderman  and for new licenses such as Stitch  Wish and Barbie.The Group maintained its communication efforts and continued its massive  Europe-wide digital marketing campaign on the Group's new products. This campaign generated more than a billion digital impressions of the Group's products over the fiscal year in Europe  helping to boost Lexibook brand awareness to an unprecedented level. At the same time  Lexibook duplicated this campaign over the year and particularly reinforced it in its fiscal Q4 on the US market to prepare for the 2024 Christmas season locally. Overall  advertising expenditure in the USA will exceed €1 million over the year.OutlookThe Group presented its 2024 collections to international retailers  and the new items were well received. Listings for the 2024 Christmas campaign are very encouraging and point to a new 2024-25 financial year in line with 23-24. The order book points to a slight year-on-year increase in business for Q1 2024-25  and Lexibook intends to maintain its momentum of profitable growth this year.Several renewals of license agreements expiring in the next few months are currently being negotiated  and the Group aims to extend them to new areas. Confirmation of these renewals will be the subject of separate press releases as they are signed.The euro/US dollar exchange rate was less favorable in the first half of the fiscal year. International freight conditions also deteriorated sharply due to the Red Sea shipping crisis. This impacted delivery times and cost prices for the Group's products.Financial calendar 2024/2025Annual results to March 31  2024: June 28  2024Availability of the Universal Registration Document on March 31  2024: June 28  2024About LexibookLexibook®  owner of more than 22 registered international brands such as Powerman®  Decotech®  Karaoke Micro Star®  Chessman®  Cyber Arcade®  Lexitab®  iParty®  FlashBoom®  etc.  is the leader in intelligent electronic leisure products for children.

This decline in production – which will gradually worsen throughout the year – stems from the significant drop in sales during the past 18 months in a drastic property market crisis.The Renovation business posted revenue of €12.8 million.Revenue from the “intermediated” business  consisting of commissions received via franchisee networks  amounted to €3.0 million. Efforts are ongoing to develop the sales network of the Illico Travaux and Camif Habitat brands. The Rénovert “energy renovation” offering has just been launched  and the first franchisees will be operational by summer 2024.Production for the “General Contractor” business – resulting from progress on renovation contracts marketed both by Hexaom's home building brands and by the specialised Camif Habitat brand for the Rhone-Alpes and Ile de France regions – amounted to €9.8 million  compared with €10.9 million in the first quarter of 2023. This drop is mainly due to the gradual transfer of Camif Habitat's “General Contractor” business to the franchise network.Real Estate Development saw Q1 revenue increase 11.4% to €12.7 million  benefiting from postponed transactions that were originally scheduled for the last quarter of 2023.Land Development posted revenue of €3.6 million  in line with current market conditions and group expectations.Quarterly order intake reflects a persistently difficult market environmentAs expected  the order intake at the end of March 2024 shows that market conditions remain difficult for the sector  even though certain signs point to a slight improvement over the coming months (first fall in interest rates  easing of lending conditions by the banks  stabilisation of prices  etc.).Home BuildingOrder intake in the first quarter of 2024 represented revenue of €105.4 million  down 39.7% compared to the same period in 2023  penalised by both a difficult market and an unfavourable base effect. Indeed  2023 sales began to fall sharply from the second quarter onwards.The average selling price has stabilised at €169.1k excluding VAT.RenovationAt 31 March 2024  “intermediated” order intake from the franchise networks totalled €34.8 million  compared with €25.9 million for the same period in 2023  an increase of 34.3%.General contractor revenue amounted to €6.3 million  compared with €10.6 million last year. This variation is mainly due to the shift of Camif Habitat's business to a franchising model.Real Estate DevelopmentAt the end of March 2024  the real estate development business had a backlog of €125.8 million  and potential inventory for delivery (including projects where a preliminary land deal has been signed) represented revenue of €324.2 million  i.e. 1 484 housing units.While a slight upturn is taking shape in the real estate development market  Hexaom's strategy remains focused on small  mid-range to high-end offerings mainly in French regions away from Paris  with a secure customer mix (predominantly social housing and institutional investors).Land DevelopmentAt the end of March  the order book (unreserved inventory) for the land development business stood at €12.5 million  representing 133 lots. This level of activity reflects the market environment.Positive outlook for 2024 operating profitabilityFor 2024  after taking into account orders at the end of April  Hexaom anticipates a decline in production of around 25 to 30% compared with 2023.Measures to adjust the cost structure to market conditions  already largely implemented in 2023  are ongoing. Hexaom should maintain a satisfactory operating profitability in 2024 of between 3% and 4% of annual revenue.With solid foundations and a very healthy financial structure  Hexaom remains confident in its ability to seize opportunities as they arise  and to bounce back as soon as market conditions improve.Next press release: 2024 Half-Year Revenue  8 August 2024  after market close.ABOUT THE GROUPSince 1919  five generations of the same family have successively taken over the helm of HEXAOM  a group that drives and federates an ecosystem of 45 brands and subsidiaries with complementary expertise.

Supported by this continued growth  the strengthening of its financial position and the expected improvement in its profitability  GECI International confirms the relevance of its strategy and its ability to maintain sustainable growth.KEY DEVELOPMENTS FOR THE YEAR__________GECI International recorded consolidated revenues of €22.8m during the year (April 2023-March 2024)  up +11.0% compared with the previous year (+11.1% at constant exchange rates).This organic progress primarily reflects the continued growth in operations to install telecommunications equipment in Brazil  as well as the continued development of the High Performance Computing (HPC) business in France. These advances are in line with the Company's strategy to focus its digital activities more on HPC  a high value-added activity with strong potential for development. However  financial IT and IT outsourcing saw a contraction in business over the year. Lastly  consolidated revenues take into account the deconsolidation of the Telecoms engineering activity in France since March 1  2024 following the sale of its business operations[1].At March 31  2024  the breakdown of the Group's consolidated revenues was as follows: 60% in France and 40% in Brazil. It factors in a non-significant negative exchange effect in Brazil  representing 0.1% of revenues.At end-March 2024  the Group had a total of 542 employees  compared with 530 at end-March 2023. The Group sold its “Telecoms” activities in France  which represented 27 people.During the year  the Group continued moving forward with its international partnerships and alliances policy  particularly with IBM  Hewlett Packard Entreprise and Amazon Web Services (AWS) for technological and commercial aspects.CHANGE IN REVENUES FOR EACH BUSINESS LINE AND REGION__________(currently being audited) Apr 2023 to Mar 2024(12 months) Apr 2022 to Mar 2023(12 months) Change €m % of rev €m % of rev (%)Half-year periods H1 11.57 50.7% 9.80 47.7% + 18.0% H2 11.25 49.3% 10.77 52.3% + 4.5% Full-year revenues 22.82 100% 20.57 100% + 11.0%Business division Digital 10.57 46.3% 11.91 57.9% - 11.3% Technology 12.26 53.7% 8.66 42.1% + 41.6% Full-year revenues 22.82 100% 20.57 100% + 11.0%Region France 13.68 60.0% 15.27 74.2% - 10.4% Brazil 9.14 40.0% 5.27 25.6% + 73.4% Israel 0.00 0.0% 0.03 0.1% ns Full-year revenues 22.82 100% 20.57 100% + 11.0%The Digital division (€10.6m  representing 46.3% of full-year revenues) is down -11.3% year-on-year. This contraction is linked mainly to the lower level of IT Outsourcing business over the period (-40.1%)  while the activities relating to High Performance Computing (HPC) show solid growth (+5.4%) and the financial activities consolidated compared with the previous year's high performance levels.The Technology division (€12.3m  representing 53.7% of full-year revenues) shows significant year-on-year growth of +41.6%. This sustained expansion is linked primarily to the ramping up of the Brazilian subsidiary's business development (+73.8% at constant exchange rates)  resulting from the rollout of major contracts signed in previous years in the telecommunications sector. In France  the Telecoms business (€2.5m over 11 months) was marked by its deconsolidation from the Group's accounts since March 1  2024. The Engineering business is stable compared with the previous year.FINANCIAL POSITION__________FY 2023-24 shows a very significant reduction in the Group's financial debt and a marked improvement in its financial position  with:the strong revenue growth for the Technologies division and the resilience of the Digital division's revenues in a complex economic environment; the strengthening of its presence alongside its main contracting authorities with a range of stronger value-added solutions  the continued increase in the average daily billing rate in France (+9.2% between April 2023 and March 2024).Net financial debt was reduced from €6.6m in March 2023 to €1.3m in March 2024  down €5.3m or 80% (figures currently being audited). This change primarily factors in the end of the Group's dispute with the party selling the Eolen companies  as well as the repayment of certain debt lines.The Group's net financial debt at end-March 2024 includes €0.6m of financial debt (including overdrafts)  €1.6m for the factoring advance  €0.9m of net OBSA bond and convertible bond debt  €0.5m for the restatement of lease charges  and €2.2m of cash.During FY 2023-24  the Group raised:€0.25m gross following a drawdown of 25 ORNAN bonds redeemable in cash and/or new shares[2] in June 2023. €1.7m gross  in March 2024  through the bond financing set up with BSA warrants attached (OBSA). At year-end March 31  2024  the Group had received more than half of the subscriptions  with the balance received in April 2024.In addition  the sale of the Telecoms activity's business operations in France enabled the Group to further strengthen its cash position by €1.5m.These various financial operations contributed to reducing the Group's debt and strengthening its equity at end-March 2024. They will also help consolidate its net working capital requirements and support its redeployment.OUTLOOK FOR 2024-25__________The digital and technology markets  with exponential growth  are rapidly transforming and opening up promising possibilities.Alliance Services Plus ( AS+) leadership for High Performance Computing: a strategic asset for GECI InternationalAS+  a Group subsidiary  has built up strong expertise in IT activities relating to High Performance Computing (HPC) powering digital simulations  IA  Big Data… and has a leading position in France in this area.In the last few years  HPC has become a strategic element for many sectors  including academic research (climatology  meteorology  genomics  etc.)  industry (biotechnology  petroleum  automotive  space  aerospace  defense  etc.) and finance (banking  insurance  etc.).

DBV is currently focused on investigating the use of its proprietary technology platform  Viaskin  to address food allergies  which are caused by a hypersensitive immune reaction and characterized by a range of symptoms varying in severity from mild to life-threatening anaphylaxis. Millions of people live with food allergies  including young children. Through epicutaneous immunotherapy (EPIT)  the Viaskin platform is designed to introduce microgram amounts of a biologically active compound to the immune system through intact skin. EPIT is a new class of non-invasive treatment that seeks to modify an individual's underlying allergy by re-educating the immune system to become desensitized to allergen by leveraging the skin's immune tolerizing properties. DBV is committed to transforming the care of food allergic people. The Company's food allergy programs include ongoing clinical trials of Viaskin Peanut in peanut allergic toddlers (1 through 3 years of age) and children (4 through 7 years of age).DBV Technologies is headquartered in Châtillon  France  with North American operations in Warren  NJ.

The collaboration was expanded in January 2022 to two new disease areas  Heart Failure and Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE)  demonstrating how the Benevolent PlatformTM can be applied across multiple therapeutic areas.The innovative collaboration structure sees scientists and technologists from the two companies work side-by-side  combining BenevolentAI’s AI-driven drug discovery platform and biomedical knowledge with AstraZeneca’s scientific and disease specific expertise  leading to novel and robust Target Identification. Both the initial and extended collaboration were agreed on similar terms with upfront payments on signing  research funding alongside discovery  development and commercial milestones. Additionally  the Company will receive tiered royalties on net sales of any commercialised products.Heart Failure is a complex syndrome which occurs when the heart cannot pump enough blood around the body. It is often complicated by multiple interrelated diseases  so requires a deep understanding of the potential disease drivers in individual patients. Current heart failure treatments follow a “one-size-fits-all” approach. However  due to the wide range of mechanisms by which heart failure can occur  there remains an unmet need for new therapies as up to 50% of patients die within five years of diagnosis.Dr Anne Phelan  Chief Scientific Officer of BenevolentAI  said:“I am delighted that AstraZeneca has selected one of the novel Heart Failure targets that we have been jointly working on to enter its portfolio. Heart Failure is a therapeutic area where there is significant medical need but  due to the size of the market  requires a team effort and significant momentum  so we are delighted to be working with AstraZeneca in this important field of medicine.”Regina Fritsche Danielson  SVP and Head of Research and Early Development  Cardiovascular  Renal and Metabolism  at AstraZeneca said:“Our ongoing collaboration with BenevolentAI has been instrumental in uncovering new insights into complex diseases such as CKD and Heart Failure. This shared expertise  combined with the power of AI  has the potential to identify the right therapeutic targets for patients with heart failure and help deliver the next generation of innovative therapies.”,neutral,0.28,0.7,0.02,mixed,0.39,0.31,0.3,True,English,"['novel Heart Failure target', 'AstraZeneca collaboration', 'BenevolentAI', 'success', 'AI-driven drug discovery platform', 'two new disease areas', 'Current heart failure treatments', 'novel Heart Failure targets', 'chronic kidney disease', 'multiple therapeutic areas', 'right therapeutic targets', 'continued positive progress', 'idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis', 'Systemic Lupus Erythematosus', 'Dr Anne Phelan', 'Regina Fritsche Danielson', 'biopharma drug discovery', 'AI-drug discovery platform', 'potential new treatments', 'potential disease drivers', 'multiple interrelated diseases', 'disease specific expertise', 'Chief Scientific Officer', 'significant medical need', 'robust Target Identification', 'innovative collaboration structure', 'two companies', 'new therapies', 'new insights', 'unmet need', 'significant momentum', 'complex diseases', 'innovative therapies', 'novel target', 'First target', 'Euronext Amsterdam', 'Benevolent PlatformTM', 'biomedical knowledge', 'similar terms', 'upfront payments', 'commercial milestones', 'tiered royalties', 'net sales', 'commercialised products', 'complex syndrome', 'enough blood', 'deep understanding', 'wide range', 'five years', 'team effort', 'next generation', 'extended collaboration', 'strategic collaboration', 'ongoing collaboration', 'advanced AI', 'research funding', 'important field', 'Early Development', 'individual patients', 'London', 'BenevolentAI', 'Company', 'BAI', 'leader', 'AstraZeneca', 'portfolio', 'IPF', 'CKD', 'January', 'SLE', 'scientists', 'technologists', 'initial', 'signing', 'body', 'approach', 'mechanisms', 'diagnosis', 'size', 'market', 'medicine', 'SVP', 'Head', 'Cardiovascular', 'Renal', 'Metabolism', 'power']",2024-05-16,2024-05-16,pharmiweb.com
