This document will be made available on the Company's website at https://aterianplc.com/LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN OF ATERIAN PLC Directors: Registered Office: Charles Bray (Chairman) 27-28 Eastcastle Street Kasra Pezeshki (Non-Executive Director) London Alister Masterton-Hume(Non-Executive Director) England Simon Rollason (CEO and Director) W1W 8DH Devon Marais (Non-Executive Director) 15 May 2024 Dear Shareholder  Notice of the Annual General Meeting Definitions used below have the meaning given to them in the Definitions section on page 6. Introduction The purpose of this document is to provide you with information about  background to  and reasons for  the Annual General Meeting and to explain why the Board unanimously recommends that you vote in favour of the Resolutions to be proposed at the Annual General Meeting  notice of which is set out at the end of this document. In addition to the ordinary business to be discussed at the Annual General Meeting  in line with a fundraising which the Company recently undertook  the Directors of the Company are intending to re-organise the Company's share capital to make it more attractive for investors. The business to be considered includes the approval of a share split and redesignation followed by a consolidation (""Capital Reorganisation""  as further detailed below)  resolutions granting the Directors authority to allot new shares (following the conversion of convertible loan notes which have been or may be granted to certain investors)  and  the disapplication of statutory pre-emption rights in relation to the issue. This letter also explains why the Directors recommend that Shareholders of the Company vote in favour of the Resolutions being proposed at the Annual General Meeting. Share Capital Reorganisation The Company currently has 1 089 171 000 ordinary shares of 1p each in issue (""Existing Ordinary Shares""). The Company plans to redesignate its share capital split so that each ordinary share of £0.01 each is split into 1 (one) ordinary share of £0.001 each (""New 0.1p Ords"") and 1 (one) deferred shares of £0.009 each (""Deferred Shares"") to enable the Company to reduce the nominal value of its shares (""Share Redesignation""). Also the Board believes this number of ordinary shares is too high and so propose to consolidate Company's the ordinary share capital on a 100 to 1 basis (""Consolidation"") so the Company will have a more manageable number of issued ordinary shares. This means that each 100 of New 0.1p Ords will be consolidated into one ordinary share of £0.10 each (""New Ordinary Shares""). 2The Deferred Shares will have no right to vote or participate in the capital of the Company save in respect of insolvency and the Company will not issue any certificates or credit CREST accounts in respect of them. The Deferred Shares will not be admitted to trading on any exchange. The rights of the New Ordinary Shares and the Deferred Shares are already set out in the articles of association that the Company adopted on 26 June 2023. For purely illustrative purposes  examples of the effects of the proposed Capital Reorganisation (should it be approved by Shareholders) are set out below: Number of Existing Number of New 0.1p Number of Number of Ordinary Shares held Ords Shares following Deferred New Ordinary the Share Shares Shares Redesignation following the following the Share Consolidation Redesignation and Redesignation 100 100 100 1 1 000 1 000 1000 10 10 000 10 000 10 000 100 It is likely that the Consolidation will result in fractional entitlements to a New Ordinary Share where any holding is not precisely divisible by 100. No certificates will be issued for fractional entitlements to New Ordinary Shares. Following the implementation of the share capital consolidation  certain shareholders may not have a proportionate shareholding of New Ordinary Shares exactly equal to their proportionate holding of Existing Ordinary Shares. Furthermore  any shareholders holding fewer than 100 Existing Ordinary Shares as at close of business on 10 June 2024 (the ""Record Date"") will cease to be a shareholder of the Company. The minimum threshold to receive New Ordinary Shares will be 100 Existing Ordinary Shares. The Articles currently permit the Directors to sell shares representing fractional entitlements arising from the proposed consolidation at Article 13. Any New Ordinary Shares in respect of which there are fractional entitlements will therefore be aggregated and sold in the market for the best price reasonably obtainable on behalf of shareholders entitled to fractions. The Company will distribute the proceeds of sale in due proportion to any such shareholders in accordance with the Articles provided that always where a member is entitled to net proceeds of sale of less that £5 these proceeds will not be distributed and will be retained for the benefit of the Company. Share certificates in respect of the New Ordinary Shares  will be issued following the Capital Reorganisation or  in the case of uncertificated holders  Euroclear UK and International Limited will be instructed to credit the CREST participant's account with New Ordinary Shares. Admission of the New Ordinary Shares Application will be made for the New Ordinary Shares to be admitted to trading on the Standard Segment of the Main Market of the Official List of the London Stock Exchange in place of the Existing Ordinary Shares. It is expected that Admission will become effective and that dealings in the New Ordinary Shares will commence on 11 June 2024. The Company's new ISIN code  following the Capital Reorganisation  will be announced as soon as available. 3Shareholders who hold Existing Ordinary Shares in uncertificated form will have such shares disabled in their CREST accounts on the Record Date  and their CREST accounts will be credited with the New Ordinary Shares following Admission  which is expected to take place on 11 June 2024. Following the Capital Reorganisation  share certificates in respect of Existing Ordinary Shares will cease to be valid. Share certificates in respect of holding of New Ordinary Shares will be sent to the registered address of shareholders on the register at 6.00pm on the record date. The share certificates will be despatched by 1st class post  at the risk of the shareholder. CLNS On 03 May 2024 the Company issued £500 000 of convertible loan notes (""CLNs"") raising £500 000 (""Fundraise"") as it was not able to issue shares due to the market price being below the nominal value of Ordinary Shares. The Company has authorised the issue of up to another £1 500 000 of CLNs. The principal due under the CLNs will automatically convert to New Ordinary Shares in the Company at a conversion price of 70 pence per ordinary shares  equating to 714 285 New Ordinary Shares (""CLN Shares"") upon the resolutions related to Capital Reorganisation being passed [and the Company publishing a simplified prospectus that is approved by the FCA (""Prospectus""). If the CLNs are not converted by 03 July 2024 then the CLNs will accrue interest at a rate of 12% per annum until 03 October 2024 when the interest rate increases to 24% per annum. Interest will be paid in cash on repayment or conversion of the CLNs. The CLNs are due to be repaid by the Company on 30 June 2025 but they become repayable earlier if there is an event of default which includes if the Capital Re-organisation is not approved before 30 June 2024. Under the terms of the CLNs  upon conversion of the CLNs holders of CLNs will receive the CLN Shares. The CLNs were issued to Simon Rollason and Altus Exploration Management Limited. Simon Rollason is a director of the Company. Altus Exploration Management Limited is the Company's largest shareholder prior to its disposal on 03 May 2024 of 65 333 371 Existing Ordinary Shares.

Appointment of ProxiesIf you are a member of the Company at the time set out in note 1 above  you are entitled to appoint a proxy to exercise all or any of your rights to ask questions and vote at the meeting and you should have received a Proxy Form with this notice of meeting. You can only appoint a proxy using the procedures set out in these notes and the notes to the Proxy Form.

Seniority is determined by the order in which the names of the joint holders appear in the Company's register of members in respect of the joint holding (the first-named being the most senior).A vote withheld is not a vote in law  which means that the vote will not be counted in the calculation of votes for or against the resolution.

Your proxy will vote (or abstain from voting) as he or she thinks fit in relation to any other matter which is put before the meeting.

Appointment of Proxies Through CREST CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies by utilising the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so for the meeting and any adjournment(s) thereof by utilising the procedures described in the CREST Manual. CREST personal members or other CREST sponsored members  and those CREST members who have appointed a voting service provider(s)  should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s)  who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf. In order for a proxy appointment made by means of CREST to be valid  the appropriate CREST message (a CREST Proxy Instruction) must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK & International Limited's (EUI) specifications and must contain the information required for such instructions  as described in the CREST Manual. The message must be transmitted so as to be received by the issuer's 8agent (7RA11) by 11.00am on 24 June 2024.

CREST members and  where applicable  their CREST sponsors or voting service providers should note that EUI does not make available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings and limitations will therefore apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or  if the CREST member is a CREST personal member or sponsored member or has appointed a voting service provider(S)  to procure that his CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time.

The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001.

Krka has been listed on the Ljubljana Stock Exchange since 1997 under the KRKG stock symbol  and since April 2012 additionally on the Warsaw Stock Exchange under the KRK stock symbol. Krka Group at a glance The Krka Group consists of the controlling company  Krka  d. d.  Novo mesto  a subsidiary in Slovenia  Terme Krka  d. o. o.  Novo mesto  and 33 subsidiaries outside Slovenia. The controlling company has a 100% stake in all subsidiaries except in Ningbo Krka Menovo Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd.  where Krka holds a 60% stake and the Chinese partner  Ningbo Menovo Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd.  a 40% stake. The Krka Group develops  produces  markets  and sells human health products (prescription pharmaceuticals and non-prescription products)  animal health products  and health resort and tourist services. Production takes place in the controlling company in Slovenia and at Krka subsidiaries in the Russian Federation  Poland  Croatia  and Germany. These subsidiaries  apart from Krka-Rus in the Russian Federation  deal with marketing and sales in addition to production. In China  production takes place in facilities subject to a long-term lease. Other subsidiaries outside Slovenia market and/or sell Krka products but do not have production capacities. The subsidiary Terme Krka provides health resort and tourist services and is the owner of Golf Grad Otočec. Krka Group business objectives for 2024 Product and service sales are projected to reach €1 850 million.The proportion of sales in markets outside Slovenia is estimated at 94%.Prescription pharmaceuticals are expected to remain the most important product class  accounting for 81% of total sales.Net profit is planned at just over €310 million.The total number of employees in Slovenia and abroad is projected to increase by 3%.€150 million primarily in expanding production and development facilities  infrastructure  and technological upgrades. The 2024 business objectives derive from the 2024-2028Krka Group Development Strategy and are based on estimates  assessments  projections  and other available data. The Management Board believe the projections are reasonable. In the event of major changes in the business environment  e.g. price erosion  rising prices of raw materials  changes in exchange rates for certain currencies important for Krka  and lower demand for pharmaceutical products  the actual operating results can deviate from the plan. Krka and Krka Group Unaudited Report Q1 2024 5BUSINESS REPORT Financial risks Foreign exchange risk Krka's key currency risk management policy remains to mitigate currency risk exposure by natural hedging. We also use financial instruments to a limited extent. The Russian rouble continues to represent the largest Krka Group currency risk. International markets offer no financial instruments to mitigate this risk  therefore we have adopted natural hedging strategies. The value of the Russian rouble denominated in the euro was stable over the course of the first three months of 2024  while the average value of the rouble expressed in the euro dropped by 20.3% year on year. We continued to hedge the risk exposure to US dollar with financial instruments in the first quarter of 2024. Unlike with other currencies  exposure to the US dollar arises from a surplus of liabilities over assets from regular business operations  or in other words  the currency position is short. Exposure to the US dollar arises primarily from purchasing raw and other materials. The value of the US dollar denominated in euros increased by 2.2% during the first quarter  while year on year the dollar's average value dropped by 1.2%. Krka's other important currencies on the sell-side remained stable in the first quarter of 2024. Total net financial gain for the first quarter of 2024 amounted to €4.5 million  taking into account net foreign exchange differences  income and expenses from financial instruments  interest income and expense  and other financial income and expenses. Credit risk The key credit risk of the Krka Group arises from trade receivables. The centralised credit control process at the Krka Group level includes all customers with credit limits exceeding €20 000. The list included over 670 such customers at the end of the first quarter of 2024  accounting for more than 95% of total trade receivables. Credit control of small customers is decentralised and carried out in the sales network under the constant supervision of the controlling company. Our credit risk management policy remained unchanged in the first three months of 2024. At the end of this period  more than 90% of Krka Group trade receivables were insured with a credit insurance company. At the end of the first quarter  the total value of trade receivables denominated in euros was up 11% from the beginning of the year. The maturity structure of receivables remained stable. The percentage of overdue receivables compared to total trade receivables remained within acceptable limits at the end of the first quarter. Investor and share information The Krka share price on the Ljubljana Stock Exchange increased by 16.8% during the first three months of 2024  trading at €128.50 on 31 March 2024. There were no major changes in the shareholder structure in the reported period.

41088,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://www.theartnewspaper.com/2024/05/17/south-african-artist-deutsche-borse-prize-lebohang-kganye,South African artist wins prestigious photo prize for 'risk-taking' Apartheid work,Johannesburg-based artist Lebohang Kganye has been awarded the Deutsche Börse Photography Foundation Prize for 2024.,Johannesburg-based artist Lebohang Kganye has been awarded the Deutsche Börse Photography Foundation Prize for 2024.The 33-year-old South African  whose works incorporate photographic montage  texts  performance and film animation  often presented as sculptural or installation pieces  collected the £30 000 award at a prize ceremony last night at The Photographers’ Gallery in London. Her work is on show there in a group exhibition with the other shortlisted artists—Valie Export  Gauri Gill & Rajesh Vangad and Hrair Sarkissian—until 2 June  which then travels to the Deutsche Börse Photography Foundation in Frankfurt (13 June-22 September).Portrait of Lebohang Kganye © Lebohang Kganye. Courtesy of the artistThe prize  perhaps the most prestigious in the world of art and documentary photography  rewards “artists and their projects recognised as having made the most significant contribution to international contemporary photography over the past 12 months”. Kganye was nominated for last year’s exhibition  Haufi nyana? I’ve come to take you home  shown at Foam in Amsterdam. The other shortlisted artists receive £5 000.The title of her work in the prize exhibition is Haufi nyana?  meaning ‘too close?’ in the Sesotho language. The large-scale installation explores “notions of home  belonging  heritage and identity”  including silhouettes and life-sized cut-out figures of her family crafted from images in photo albums to consider the legacy of apartheid through her own personal history.“This work is really based on research that I've been doing since the moment that my mother passed away ” Kganye said in her acceptance speech last night. “So this moment is very much about a celebration of the legacy she's left me... my inheritance  my heritage… and also really finding my identity as a young South African woman.”She is the third South African artist to win the prize  which this year celebrated the 20th anniversary of its collaboration between The Photographers’ Gallery—which initiated and runs the award—and the Deutsche Börse Photography Foundation (a selection of its burgeoning collection is currently on show at Somerset House as part of Photo London  on until 19 May). Mikhael Subotzky won with Patrick Waterhouse in 2015  and Adam Broomberg collected the prize alongside Oliver Chanarin in 2013.The prize also has a strong connection with South African and a particular South African school of photography. The Market Photo Workshop in Johannesburg was founded by David Goldblatt  who was nominated for the prize in 2004. Jo Ratcliffe  shortlisted in 2022  taught there. And both Kganye and Zanele Muholi  shortlisted in 2015  were students there. Outside of the workshop  another two South Africans have been nominated also: Pieter Hugo (2012) and Roger Ballen (in 2002  when the prize was known as the Citigroup Photography Prize).In the wake of George Floyd’s murder and ensuing Black Lives Matters protests  the prize and its organisers were criticised for the lack of winners who were artists of colour. Just three artists of colour had won the prize prior to Mohamed Bourouissa in 2020: Shirana Shahbazi 2002)  Walid Raad (2007) and Luke Willis Thompson (2018).

Despite this  the dividend yield at 4.89% is below the top quartile in the Dutch market  and its dividend history over the past decade has been volatile with no consistent growth pattern. The stock is currently valued at 14.5% below estimated fair value  suggesting potential undervaluation.

At the same time the pipeline looks promising to ensure a strong 2024.HighlightsRevenue achievement for 1Q24 similar to the first quarter of 2023.Secured revenue* of 135.6Mio€ sustaining our revenue guidance of EUR 180-195 million.Operational expenses under control  with some investments in an increasing team member base to support our continuous growth ambitions.Based on the 1Q24 results  a full year EBIT guidance of EUR 38.0 – 45.0 million is announced.Net cash is restoring to EUR 56.1 million  with important progress made on clearing aged receivables.*secured revenue includes the already recognized revenue as well as open orders on hand that will be recognized as revenue in 2024CommentsSerge Van Herck  CEO comments:“As we navigate through the first quarter  we are well-positioned to deliver a robust performance in 2024.This year holds special significance for EVS as we celebrate our 30th anniversary. Over the past three decades  we have continuously pushed the boundaries of innovation in the broadcast industry  and we are excited to mark this milestone with our customers  channel partners and EVS operators around the world. Additionally  as we look ahead  we are proud to power the major Big Events with worldwide viewership taking place in Europe over the coming months  further showcasing the reliability and excellence of our various EVS solutions. Additionally  I am pleased to highlight the growing attention our Media Infrastructure solutions are receiving from customers worldwide. These solutions will also play a significant role in delivering the upcoming major Big Events to billions of viewers worldwide  further solidifying EVS as a trusted partner in delivering seamless and reliable live broadcast experiences.At EVS  innovation remains at the core of everything we do. Our generative AI-enabled XtraMotion capability that is seamlessly integrated in our LiveCeption solution  continues to revolutionize the industry  transforming regular broadcast cameras into super slow-motion cameras. The integration of artificial intelligence-based search capabilities in our MediaCeption solution  coupled with the recent launch of VIA MAP during NAB in Las Vegas  underscores our commitment to advancing technological boundaries and delivering unparalleled value to our customers.Furthermore  I am delighted to share that our environmental  social  and governance (ESG) efforts are gaining further recognition  with EVS now being included in the BEL ESG index. This recognition reflects our ongoing commitment to sustainability and responsible corporate citizenship.However  amidst our optimism  we remain vigilant in the face of challenges. The geopolitical situation in Ukraine and Palestine continues to present uncertainties  particularly concerning component supply. We are closely monitoring developments and taking necessary precautions to mitigate any potential impact on our operations.”Commenting on the results and the outlook  Veerle De Wit  CFO  said:“Despite a limited production capacity  due to the preparation of the Big Events of 2024  EVS is again able to deliver a strong quarter in terms of revenue. At the same time  our pipeline is shaping up  stemming us positively on the full year potential. We continue to keep control over our spending patterns  with some planned investments in our team member base. These investments are primarily focused on accelerating our growth in North America. Next to that  we continue to invest in our digital transformation and our security framework.Besides a strong income statement  we are also happy to see that our cash position is further strengthening. We were able to considerably reduce our aged receivables compared to end of 2023.With the current revenue guidance in vigor  we issue an Earnings Before Interest & Taxes (EBIT) guidance of the year: based on the 1Q24 results and the market dynamics  we expect it to land between EUR 38.0 – 45.0 million. The higher end of the range clearly underlines our ambition to realize sustainable and profitable growth again in 2024.”Market & customersDuring the preceding quarter  EVS persistently advanced its growth drivers  notably focusing on LAB market pillar  the NALA region  MediaCeption  and Media Infrastructure solutions  alongside fortifying its indirect sales channels.Supported by a robust order backlog  revenues from LAB customers and the NALA region exhibited year-over-year growth  bolstered by the global upsurge in revenue from MediaCeption and MediaInfra solutions.EVS's channel partner ecosystem further gained in strength  evident at the NAB event in April. Amid commemorations of the company’s 30-year anniversary  our partners showcased EVS solutions to a diverse array of customers  extending beyond the established large clientele. The compelling narrative surrounding MediaInfra solutions led to fervent interest and engagement  occupying a significant portion of our booth’s demonstration space.The spectrum of growth extends beyond these pivotal levers. The EMEA region experienced a notable surge in order intake  with customers expressing keen interest in VIA MAP  introduced at last year’s IBC in Europe and this year’s NAB in North America.EVS remains committed to empowering LSP customers through the modernization of their OBVans  exemplified by initiatives such as Alkass's deployment of LiveCeption solution in Qatar and LMG's adoption of LiveIP Strada evolutive routing solution in the US to serve All-Elite-Wrestling  as announced at NAB.While revenues from China have yet to reclaim pre-COVID levels  there are signs of a gradual resurgence in orders.EVS maintains meticulous inventory management practices to ensure timely delivery of hardware-based products in accordance with commitments. Accelerated production efforts are underway to meet demand ahead of major upcoming events this summer. Furthermore  EVS remains vigilant in monitoring inflationary trends across global regions  progressively integrating adjustments into pricing and business models.TechnologiesEVS remains dedicated to nurturing its ""premium live ecosystem.""Enhancements to LiveCeption now incorporate more AI-based effects  augmenting the existing XtraMotion capabilities. Additionally  EVS is introducing a suite of image enhancements – for example cinematic effects – readily activatable by EVS operators from any broadcast camera with just a touch  eliminating the need for specialized cameras at the venue.Furthermore  EVS offers diverse operational modes for the XT-VIA  coupled with innovative business models. Through flexible on-demand activation of extra features  EVS technology becomes more accessible and cost-effective for both LAB and LSP customers.MediaInfra solutions have seen significant enhancements  including the widespread deployment of Neuron View – a low-latency multiviewer. This new application not only enhances the Neuron platform's versatility but also significantly reduces carbon footprint through server reuse. The Neuron platform itself demonstrates exceptional energy efficiency  outperforming pure software platforms by up to 8 times and rival solutions by up to twice in energy efficiency.EVS continues to expand its solutions by integrating third-party components. Providius  a media network performance monitoring platform  now serves as a premium solution partner with Cerebrum  ensuring seamless operation of LiveIP networks. Cerebrum now supports an extended range of touch panels  offering customers a wider selection for efficient control over broadcast equipment and workflows.In addition  MediaCeption solutions have been reinforced to seamlessly integrate with VizRT newsroom playout automation  enhancing the scope of innovations within the software production server.Lastly  EVS remains steadfast in developing cybersecurity across its product portfolio. The NAB breakfast  co-hosted by EVS in collaboration with Arista and Providius  focused on cybersecurity and witnessed full attendance. This underscores the industry's growing interest in this domain and reaffirms EVS's commitment to its Environmental  Social  and Governance (ESG) objectives.Corporate topics2024 is an important year for EVS: we celebrate 30 years of broadcast innovation. Centered around the theme of “Family & Friends Together for Live”  EVS will engage with the global community in live production around these festivities.In the first quarter of 2024 we renewed our EcoVadis rating: for a second consecutive year  our ESG strategy was awarded with a silver medal. This rating recognizes our reinforced commitment to sustainability and ranks EVS at the forefront of companies implementing ESG policies.Another important event marking our sustainability agenda  is the fact that EVS entered the BEL ESG index in March. The BEL ESG index  published by Euronext  serves as a benchmark for investors and shareholders seeking companies that prioritize sustainability and responsible business practices.Finally  on the social forefront of our ESG agenda  we have also renewed our Top Employer status (second year in a row).In 2024 we will continue and progress on our ESG journey. We will renew our carbon footprint exercise with focus on quality and consistency of data points  we will start the roll out of the CSRD requirements for 2025 and we will continue to put focus on those actions that really matter.From a security point of view  we will carefully monitor the evolution of the NIS2 requirements  and ensure that we remain at the forefront of this evolution.From a tooling perspective  we want to continue build on our backbone that we have put in place over the last years. We focus on unlocking the full power of our ERP implementation but also develop new tooling to ensure optimal efficiency. This year we will implement a new Configure  Price & Quoting tool (CPQ) and we will focus our efforts to implement a fully operational On Demand Activation of our licenses.As the macro-economic environment is still quite volatile  it is important that we continue to focus on the profitability of our solutions. We systematically monitor the pricing models and strategy  to cope with market realities and trends. This resulted in new list prices announced in March 2024.In terms of team members  we expect a net increase in the number of team members during the year as we accelerate our growth in North America.OutlookThe 2024 secured revenue on March 31st reaches EUR 135.6 million. Based on this measure  we are reconfirming our revenue guidance for the full year from EUR 180-195 million.The gross margin for the full year 2024 is expected to decline marginally as a result of a change in the solution mix. The gross margin by solution is expected to evolve positively  with any impact of rising costs of components being reflected in the price increases modelled. The most recent price increase was introduced in March 2024.Operational expenses continue to be closely monitored and controlled. At the end of 2023 we have gradually grown our team member base again (after some months of stabilization). The investments are continuing in 2024 and are primarily focussing on reinforcing our teams in North America.With the revenue guidance reconfirmed  we also introduce an EBIT guidance for the year to be in the range of EUR 38.0 – 45.0 million.DividendWe reiterate the full year 2024 expected dividend distribution of EUR 1.10 per share  which remains subject to market conditions and to the approval of the Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders.Corporate CalendarMay 21th  2024: General AssemblyAugust 13th  2024: Q2 and H1 2024 results (post closing of the market)November 14th  2024: Q3 2024 Trading update (post closing of the market)For more information  please contact:Veerle De Wit  CFO*EVS Broadcast Equipment S.A.

At the same time the pipeline looks promising to ensure a strong 2024.HighlightsRevenue achievement for 1Q24 similar to the first quarter of 2023.Secured revenue* of 135.6Mio€ sustaining our revenue guidance of EUR 180-195 million.Operational expenses under control  with some investments in an increasing team member base to support our continuous growth ambitions.Based on the 1Q24 results  a full year EBIT guidance of EUR 38.0 – 45.0 million is announced.Net cash is restoring to EUR 56.1 million  with important progress made on clearing aged receivables.*secured revenue includes the already recognized revenue as well as open orders on hand that will be recognized as revenue in 2024CommentsSerge Van Herck  CEO comments:“As we navigate through the first quarter  we are well-positioned to deliver a robust performance in 2024.This year holds special significance for EVS as we celebrate our 30th anniversary. Over the past three decades  we have continuously pushed the boundaries of innovation in the broadcast industry  and we are excited to mark this milestone with our customers  channel partners and EVS operators around the world. Additionally  as we look ahead  we are proud to power the major Big Events with worldwide viewership taking place in Europe over the coming months  further showcasing the reliability and excellence of our various EVS solutions. Additionally  I am pleased to highlight the growing attention our Media Infrastructure solutions are receiving from customers worldwide. These solutions will also play a significant role in delivering the upcoming major Big Events to billions of viewers worldwide  further solidifying EVS as a trusted partner in delivering seamless and reliable live broadcast experiences.At EVS  innovation remains at the core of everything we do. Our generative AI-enabled XtraMotion capability that is seamlessly integrated in our LiveCeption solution  continues to revolutionize the industry  transforming regular broadcast cameras into super slow-motion cameras. The integration of artificial intelligence-based search capabilities in our MediaCeption solution  coupled with the recent launch of VIA MAP during NAB in Las Vegas  underscores our commitment to advancing technological boundaries and delivering unparalleled value to our customers.Furthermore  I am delighted to share that our environmental  social  and governance (ESG) efforts are gaining further recognition  with EVS now being included in the BEL ESG index. This recognition reflects our ongoing commitment to sustainability and responsible corporate citizenship.However  amidst our optimism  we remain vigilant in the face of challenges. The geopolitical situation in Ukraine and Palestine continues to present uncertainties  particularly concerning component supply. We are closely monitoring developments and taking necessary precautions to mitigate any potential impact on our operations.”Commenting on the results and the outlook  Veerle De Wit  CFO  said:“Despite a limited production capacity  due to the preparation of the Big Events of 2024  EVS is again able to deliver a strong quarter in terms of revenue. At the same time  our pipeline is shaping up  stemming us positively on the full year potential. We continue to keep control over our spending patterns  with some planned investments in our team member base. These investments are primarily focused on accelerating our growth in North America. Next to that  we continue to invest in our digital transformation and our security framework.Besides a strong income statement  we are also happy to see that our cash position is further strengthening. We were able to considerably reduce our aged receivables compared to end of 2023.With the current revenue guidance in vigor  we issue an Earnings Before Interest & Taxes (EBIT) guidance of the year: based on the 1Q24 results and the market dynamics  we expect it to land between EUR 38.0 – 45.0 million. The higher end of the range clearly underlines our ambition to realize sustainable and profitable growth again in 2024.”Market & customersDuring the preceding quarter  EVS persistently advanced its growth drivers  notably focusing on LAB market pillar  the NALA region  MediaCeption  and Media Infrastructure solutions  alongside fortifying its indirect sales channels.Supported by a robust order backlog  revenues from LAB customers and the NALA region exhibited year-over-year growth  bolstered by the global upsurge in revenue from MediaCeption and MediaInfra solutions.EVS's channel partner ecosystem further gained in strength  evident at the NAB event in April. Amid commemorations of the company’s 30-year anniversary  our partners showcased EVS solutions to a diverse array of customers  extending beyond the established large clientele. The compelling narrative surrounding MediaInfra solutions led to fervent interest and engagement  occupying a significant portion of our booth’s demonstration space.The spectrum of growth extends beyond these pivotal levers. The EMEA region experienced a notable surge in order intake  with customers expressing keen interest in VIA MAP  introduced at last year’s IBC in Europe and this year’s NAB in North America.EVS remains committed to empowering LSP customers through the modernization of their OBVans  exemplified by initiatives such as Alkass's deployment of LiveCeption solution in Qatar and LMG's adoption of LiveIP Strada evolutive routing solution in the US to serve All-Elite-Wrestling  as announced at NAB.While revenues from China have yet to reclaim pre-COVID levels  there are signs of a gradual resurgence in orders.EVS maintains meticulous inventory management practices to ensure timely delivery of hardware-based products in accordance with commitments. Accelerated production efforts are underway to meet demand ahead of major upcoming events this summer. Furthermore  EVS remains vigilant in monitoring inflationary trends across global regions  progressively integrating adjustments into pricing and business models.TechnologiesEVS remains dedicated to nurturing its ""premium live ecosystem.""Enhancements to LiveCeption now incorporate more AI-based effects  augmenting the existing XtraMotion capabilities. Additionally  EVS is introducing a suite of image enhancements – for example cinematic effects – readily activatable by EVS operators from any broadcast camera with just a touch  eliminating the need for specialized cameras at the venue.Furthermore  EVS offers diverse operational modes for the XT-VIA  coupled with innovative business models. Through flexible on-demand activation of extra features  EVS technology becomes more accessible and cost-effective for both LAB and LSP customers.MediaInfra solutions have seen significant enhancements  including the widespread deployment of Neuron View – a low-latency multiviewer. This new application not only enhances the Neuron platform's versatility but also significantly reduces carbon footprint through server reuse. The Neuron platform itself demonstrates exceptional energy efficiency  outperforming pure software platforms by up to 8 times and rival solutions by up to twice in energy efficiency.EVS continues to expand its solutions by integrating third-party components. Providius  a media network performance monitoring platform  now serves as a premium solution partner with Cerebrum  ensuring seamless operation of LiveIP networks. Cerebrum now supports an extended range of touch panels  offering customers a wider selection for efficient control over broadcast equipment and workflows.In addition  MediaCeption solutions have been reinforced to seamlessly integrate with VizRT newsroom playout automation  enhancing the scope of innovations within the software production server.Lastly  EVS remains steadfast in developing cybersecurity across its product portfolio. The NAB breakfast  co-hosted by EVS in collaboration with Arista and Providius  focused on cybersecurity and witnessed full attendance. This underscores the industry's growing interest in this domain and reaffirms EVS's commitment to its Environmental  Social  and Governance (ESG) objectives.Corporate topics2024 is an important year for EVS: we celebrate 30 years of broadcast innovation. Centered around the theme of “Family & Friends Together for Live”  EVS will engage with the global community in live production around these festivities.In the first quarter of 2024 we renewed our EcoVadis rating: for a second consecutive year  our ESG strategy was awarded with a silver medal. This rating recognizes our reinforced commitment to sustainability and ranks EVS at the forefront of companies implementing ESG policies.Another important event marking our sustainability agenda  is the fact that EVS entered the BEL ESG index in March. The BEL ESG index  published by Euronext  serves as a benchmark for investors and shareholders seeking companies that prioritize sustainability and responsible business practices.Finally  on the social forefront of our ESG agenda  we have also renewed our Top Employer status (second year in a row).In 2024 we will continue and progress on our ESG journey. We will renew our carbon footprint exercise with focus on quality and consistency of data points  we will start the roll out of the CSRD requirements for 2025 and we will continue to put focus on those actions that really matter.From a security point of view  we will carefully monitor the evolution of the NIS2 requirements  and ensure that we remain at the forefront of this evolution.From a tooling perspective  we want to continue build on our backbone that we have put in place over the last years. We focus on unlocking the full power of our ERP implementation but also develop new tooling to ensure optimal efficiency. This year we will implement a new Configure  Price & Quoting tool (CPQ) and we will focus our efforts to implement a fully operational On Demand Activation of our licenses.As the macro-economic environment is still quite volatile  it is important that we continue to focus on the profitability of our solutions. We systematically monitor the pricing models and strategy  to cope with market realities and trends. This resulted in new list prices announced in March 2024.In terms of team members  we expect a net increase in the number of team members during the year as we accelerate our growth in North America.OutlookThe 2024 secured revenue on March 31st reaches EUR 135.6 million. Based on this measure  we are reconfirming our revenue guidance for the full year from EUR 180-195 million.The gross margin for the full year 2024 is expected to decline marginally as a result of a change in the solution mix. The gross margin by solution is expected to evolve positively  with any impact of rising costs of components being reflected in the price increases modelled. The most recent price increase was introduced in March 2024.Operational expenses continue to be closely monitored and controlled. At the end of 2023 we have gradually grown our team member base again (after some months of stabilization). The investments are continuing in 2024 and are primarily focussing on reinforcing our teams in North America.With the revenue guidance reconfirmed  we also introduce an EBIT guidance for the year to be in the range of EUR 38.0 – 45.0 million.DividendWe reiterate the full year 2024 expected dividend distribution of EUR 1.10 per share  which remains subject to market conditions and to the approval of the Ordinary General Meeting of Shareholders.Corporate CalendarMay 21th  2024: General AssemblyAugust 13th  2024: Q2 and H1 2024 results (post closing of the market)November 14th  2024: Q3 2024 Trading update (post closing of the market)For more information  please contact:Veerle De Wit  CFO*EVS Broadcast Equipment S.A.

These resolutions and their results are posted on the Investors/Annual General Meetings section of the Company’s website: https://dbv-technologies.com/events/2024-annual-general-meeting/.About DBV TechnologiesDBV Technologies is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing treatment options for food allergies and other immunologic conditions with significant unmet medical need. DBV is currently focused on investigating the use of its proprietary technology platform  Viaskin™  to address food allergies  which are caused by a hypersensitive immune reaction and characterized by a range of symptoms varying in severity from mild to life-threatening anaphylaxis. Millions of people live with food allergies  including young children. Through epicutaneous immunotherapy (EPIT™)  the Viaskin platform is designed to introduce microgram amounts of a biologically active compound to the immune system through intact skin. EPIT is a new class of non-invasive treatment that seeks to modify an individual’s underlying allergy by re-educating the immune system to become desensitized to allergen by leveraging the skin’s immune tolerizing properties. DBV is committed to transforming the care of food allergic people. The Company’s food allergy programs include ongoing clinical trials of Viaskin Peanut in peanut allergic toddlers (1 through 3 years of age) and children (4 through 7 years of age).DBV Technologies is headquartered in Châtillon  France  with North American operations in Warren  NJ.

The safety data was unblinded to the DMC but remains blinded with respect to the Company. The DMC review supports the continuation of the NATiV3 clinical trial without modification to the current trial protocol. This positive recommendation confirms the good safety and tolerability profile of lanifibranor.About lanifibranorLanifibranor  Inventiva’s lead product candidate  is an orally-available small molecule that acts to induce anti-fibrotic  anti-inflammatory and beneficial vascular and metabolic changes in the body by activating all three peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (“PPAR”) isoforms  which are well-characterized nuclear receptor proteins that regulate gene expression. Lanifibranor is a PPAR agonist that is designed to target all three PPAR isoforms in a moderately potent manner  with a well-balanced activation of PPARα and PPARδ  and a partial activation of PPARγ. While there are other PPAR agonists that target only one or two PPAR isoforms for activation  lanifibranor is the only pan-PPAR agonist in clinical development for the treatment of MASH/NASH. Inventiva believes that lanifibranor’s moderate and balanced pan-PPAR binding profile contributes to the favorable tolerability profile that has been observed in clinical trials and pre-clinical studies to date. The FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy and Fast Track designation to lanifibranor for the treatment of MASH/NASH.About the NATiV3 Phase III trialNATiV3 is a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lanifibranor (800mg/daily and 1200mg/daily) in adult patients with biopsy-proven non-cirrhotic MASH/NASH and F2/F3 stage of liver fibrosis. The trial takes place in 24 countries and more than 400 clinical sites and to recruit approximately 900 patients to be treated over a 72-week period. The effect of lanifibranor will be assessed on several histological endpoints  including NASH resolution and improvement of fibrosis of at least one stage.An exploratory cohort is anticipated to enrol approximately 200 patients with MASH/NASH and fibrosis who are not eligible for the main NATiV3 trial. Inventiva anticipates that this exploratory cohort may allow the generation of additional data using non-invasive tests and contribute to the regulatory safety database requirement to support the planned submission for potential accelerated approval to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and potential conditional approval to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) of lanifibranor for the treatment of NASH.For more information about NATiV3  visit clinicaltrials.gov.About InventivaInventiva is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the research and development of oral small molecule therapies for the treatment of patients with MASH/NASH and other diseases with significant unmet medical need.

The 2.4% increase in revenues generated by retailers in retail units of less than 500 sqm was partly offset by the 1.3% fall in revenues from units of more than 500 sqm.In terms of letting activity  eight leases were signed2 representing total rents of €0.3 million and a total floor area of 1 550 sqm. These include the signing of a lease for a total of 400 sqm with discount retailer Normal  providing a second anchor for the Ollioules regional shopping centre alongside the Carrefour hypermarket.Change in gross rental incomeGross rental income for the first quarter of 2024 totalled €3.77 million. This represents a slight fall of 0.8% relative to the same period in 2023.€m Q12024 Q12023 Change Total gross rental income 3.77 3.80 -0.8%(unaudited figures)MRM benefited from indexation  which averaged at 4.7% in the first quarter of 2024  as well as the effect of new leases signed since 1st January 2023. However  these positive factors did not completely make up for the impact of several units becoming vacant as a result of two main events:The strategic vacancy of space within the Flins regional shopping centre with the framework of proposed redevelopment/renovation works. At the end of December 2023  this vacancy represented 1 700 sqm. In the first quarter of 2024  two new units were vacated in the zone in question  bringing the total floor space involved to 2 150 sqm. As a reminder  MRM has stated that this vacancy would affect a total of 13 lots representing 2 900 sqm  or 29% of the centre’s floor area;The departure of Habitat that has been placed in receivership  which occupied a 2 500 sqm unit at Carré Vélizy. MRM confirms that it has received letters of interest about reletting this space.Adjusted for these two events  revenues increased by €0.2 million (+5.8%).Non-Financial Performance StatementOn 26 April 2024  MRM published its Non-Financial Performance Statement (Déclaration de Performance Extra-Financière or DPEF3) on a voluntary basis for the second year in a row.In keeping with its decision to give priority initially to the challenges of climate change  the Non-Financial Performance Statement can be used to track progress made in achieving a more efficient  low-carbon energy mix. MRM reiterates that at the end of 2023  it was ahead of schedule in achieving the energy efficiency and decarbonisation targets set for its property portfolio by 2030  i.e.:A 45% reduction in energy consumption relative to the baseline years  5 points ahead of the target of a 40% reduction by 2030 in line with the French Tertiary Decree. In total  90% of the portfolio already complies with the 2030 regulation.A 48% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions relative to the baseline years in 2023  which were below the level set for achieving the 2030 target.OutlookMRM will continue in 2024 to pursue its asset management strategy based on:Analysing and implementing investment programmes aimed at enhancing the value of properties. Priorities include the partial redevelopment/renovation of the Flins regional shopping centre and that of Les Halles du Beffroi in Amiens with a view to extending the food anchor;Proactive management of the retailer mix and letting of available space  including the signing of a lease for the unit vacated by Habitat at Carré Vélizy;The rollout of the ESG action plan and the Climate Plan adopted by the Company  paying particular attention to continuing to reduce energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.MRM confirms its target of annualised net rents of over €16 million in 2025. This target is based on the current portfolio (excluding acquisitions and disposals).CalendarThe general shareholders’ meeting to approve the financial statements for 2023 will be held on 5 June 2024.Revenues for the second quarter and 2024 first half results will be released on 26 July 2024 after market close.About MRMMRM is a listed real estate investment company that owns and manages a portfolio of retail properties across several regions of France.

Unit sales: On 13 July 2022  DGB already sold 507 720 carbon units (approximately 30% of the total expected tCO 2 e of the Project) against an upfront payment of €1.7 million upon completing certain milestones. On 10 April 2024  DGB achieved the final milestone under this agreement.

Timeline and prospects: The Project is now progressing through the rigorous verification process as DGB has submitted for the Project's first verification at the Gold Standard registry for the 2022-2024 monitoring period. The first carbon units are expected to be delivered in Q3 2024.In 2020  DGB started with its first project and now has seven large-scale projects under management and in operation. The operational team is conducting preliminary studies on 12 more projects. Projects need two to six years of financing before they start producing carbon units. In 2023  the Group expanded its project development pipeline to 60.1 million carbon units under management  marking a substantial +58% year-over-year growth. Complementing this growth  DGB has strategically diversified its project pipeline  venturing into new domains with the inclusion of plastic and biodiversity credits through new projects and methodologies. This strategic diversification into new project types marks a pivotal step in its ongoing commitment to environmental innovation  sustainability  and diversified revenue streams.Photos and mediaLinksProject pageRecent Project updateGold Standard listingContact for press enquiriesFor more information about DGB's initiatives  please contact:DGB GROUP NVpress@green.earth+31320788118Visit our website: https://www.green.earth/DisclaimerThis press release does not contain an (invitation to make an) offer to buy or sell or otherwise acquire or subscribe to shares in DGB and is not an advice or recommendation to take or refrain from taking any action.

This facility is designed to meet the exponential demand for the decarbonization of air transport. Developed with multiple public and private partners  Paris-Vatry SAF will be located at Paris-Vatry airport  in the Grand-Est Region.“This is a strategic project  as it contributes to the decarbonization of aviation and reflects the green reindustrialization policy  a source of job creation  that we are collectively pursuing. It offers unprecedented development prospects for the economic and industrial sovereignty of the Grand-Est Region and of France""  states Regional President Franck Leroy.The biofuel will be produced using Haffner Energy's patented technological process  via the thermolysis of local biomass residues. Marne County (“département de la Marne”) is close to Paris and owns Paris-Vatry airport  where the project will be developed. It is also France's leading agricultural county in terms of Useful Agricultural Surface (SAU)  with a remarkably high level of agricultural residues.The county has signed an MoU with Haffner Energy.“Haffner Energy's SAF production project is fully in line with our ambition to enhance the attractiveness of Paris-Vatry airport in order to strengthen its economic development ” says Jean-Marc Roze  President of the Marne County government. “Our airport has great potential  and the availability of sustainable aviation fuel will be a competitive advantage in attracting airlines with regular import and export flows ” he adds.An ambitious project to decarbonize aviationParis-Vatry SAF will boast an initial production capacity of 30 000 tonnes of SAF per year  with the option of doubling production to 60 000 tonnes. A tripling to 90 000 tonnes per year could also be achieved by adding modules in a second phase of the project.Each tonne of SAF amounts to 3 tons of CO2 avoided in the atmosphere  according to life-cycle analysis. In addition  more than 3 tonnes of biogenic CO2 are extracted from the SAFNOCA® process.This project will contribute to meet regulatory obligations to decarbonize aviation in Europe. Several airlines have already expressed a keen interest in the SAF produced at Paris-Vatry airport  not least because of its proximity to major international airports  primarily Paris-Charles de Gaulle  but also Luxembourg and Brussels. Several industry players have expressed an interest in investing in this project.SAFNOCA® technology for SAF productionThe proprietary SAFNOCA® technology developed by Haffner Energy  the result of its 30 years' experience  has the unique characteristic of being feedstock agnostic. Biomass is an abundant raw material provided it is used in a technology process that requires no restrictive quality criteria.A sustainable and competitive SAF project requires the ability to accept all kinds of biomass without conflicts of use nor restrictions. This is where the unique positioning of SAFNOCA® technology comes into play.A strong contribution to the circular economy  particularly in agricultureAgricultural residues with no conflicts of use will provide local farmers with a significant and stable additional income over the long term. Biomass handling and logistics will create many indirect jobs.A solid ecosystem of partners to contribute to the project's successIn addition to the partnership with Marne County  the project will rely on a number of technological partnerships  including with leading engineering companies.Haffner Energy has also forged partnerships with several biomass suppliers (agricultural and forestry residues  energy crops grown on marginal land) to secure the supply of the biomass required for this project. This approach is part of a strong commitment to involve all stakeholders.A new unit structured around the development of SAFParis-Vatry SAF is the first SAF project announced by Haffner Energy. The Company is actively developing other SAF projects in Europe and the United States. Among other things  current discussions on Paris-Vatry SAF also involve opportunities to replicate the project internationally.“These major strategic projects are highly value-creating for the Company  which is why we have created a dedicated SAF unit headed by Marcella Franchi  with Francisco Da Silva Passos in charge of SAF Business Development”  says Philippe Haffner  Chairman and CEO of the Company.ABOUT HAFFNER ENERGYHaffner Energy designs  manufactures  supplies and operates biofuel and hydrogen solutions using biomass residues. Its innovative  patented thermolysis technology produces Sustainable Aviation Fuel  as well as renewable gas  hydrogen and methanol. It also contributes to regenerating the planet through the co-production of biogenic CO2 and/or biochar/biocarbon.

Tenders have been won in several European countries  the UK  the USA  Canada and JAPAC countries  while order intake remain dependent on the timelines for managing state budgets in several NATO countries.Photogrammetry businessRevenues for the photogrammetry business came to €6.4m (-10% at constant exchange rates)  representing 41% of Group revenues. The basis for comparison includes non-recurring enterprise deployments recorded in early 2023. Innovations  particularly to expand the compatibility of solutions with mobile phones  were launched in April: they further strengthen synergies between the data captured by the drones and data on the ground  and add assisted reality features that increase precision levels and provide very innovative capabilities for tracking over time. They are aimed in priority at the construction  geomatics and civil security sectors.OutlookWhile the interest in secure and autonomous microdrones is highlighted by the preponderance of new technologies in the current conflicts  Parrot is working to meet the technological and operational challenges faced to ensure the success of its next microdrone  which is driving trends in 2024.In the photogrammetry sector  the expansion of the addressable market  capitalizing in particular on complementary equipment  is a key area for growth  as in 2023.With the effective implementation of its strategic plan and its rigorous management of operations and investments  the Group has financial resources in place enabling it to continue moving forward with its ambitions for development.Next financial datesCombined general meeting: Wednesday June 5  2024 from 9am2024 second-quarter business and 2024 first-half earnings: Friday August 2  2024 at 8amABOUT THE PARROT GROUPParrot is Europe's leading commercial microUAV group.

The Company anticipates that the ADS Ratio Change will be effective on or about June 3rd  2024 (the ""Effective Date"").For the Company's ADS holders  the change in the ADS Ratio will have the same effect as a one-for-two reverse ADS split and is intended to enable the Company to regain compliance with the Nasdaq minimum bid price requirement. On the Effective Date  registered holders of company ADSs held in certificated form will be required on a mandatory basis to surrender their certificated ADSs to the depositary bank for cancellation and will receive one (1) new ADS in exchange for every two existing ADSs surrendered. Holders of uncertificated ADSs in the Direct Registration System (""DRS"") and in The Depository Trust Company (""DTC"") will have their ADSs automatically exchanged and need not take any action. The exchange of every two existing ADSs then-held for one (1) new ADS will occur automatically  at the Effective Date  with the then-held ADSs being cancelled and new ADSs being issued by the depositary bank. DBV's ADSs will continue to be traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the ticker symbol ""DBVT"".No fractional new ADSs will be issued in connection with the change in the ADS Ratio. Instead  fractional entitlements to new ADSs will be aggregated and sold by the depositary bank and the net cash proceeds from the sale of the fractional ADS entitlements (after deduction of fees  taxes and expenses) will be distributed to the applicable ADS holders by the depositary bank. The ADS Ratio Change will have no impact on DBV's underlying ordinary shares  and no ordinary shares will be issued or cancelled in connection with the ADS Ratio Change.As a result of the change in the ADS Ratio  DBV's ADS trading price is expected to increase proportionally  although the Company can give no assurance that the ADS trading price after the ADS Ratio Change will be equal to or greater than twice the ADS trading price before the change.About DBV TechnologiesDBV Technologies is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing treatment options for food allergies and other immunologic conditions with significant unmet medical need. DBV is currently focused on investigating the use of its proprietary technology platform  Viaskin  to address food allergies  which are caused by a hypersensitive immune reaction and characterized by a range of symptoms varying in severity from mild to life-threatening anaphylaxis. Millions of people live with food allergies  including young children. Through epicutaneous immunotherapy (EPIT)  the Viaskin platform is designed to introduce microgram amounts of a biologically active compound to the immune system through intact skin.

DBV is committed to transforming the care of food allergic people. The Company's food allergy programs include ongoing clinical trials of Viaskin Peanut in peanut allergic toddlers (1 through 3 years of age) and children (4 through 7 years of age).DBV Technologies is headquartered in Châtillon  France  with North American operations in Warren  NJ.

Watch out for this level in the next sessions.The RSI at 38.84 is approaching the oversold area  but given the extreme volatility of the last days  it cannot be followed accurately.Ivory Coast and Ghana represent together about 60% of world's production with Ivory Coast exports down 30% and Ghana down 41% year to date as a result of bad weather and a devastating bean disease. Cocoa remains in deficit for the third year and is expected to be in deficit in 2025 as well  with some light positive news from the recent World Cocoa Conference in Brussels indicating a production increase in the next crop (October-March).Short term though  the fundamental situation has not changed much  and with a majority of speculative positions and record-low liquidity  this market will stay very volatile for a while.Positive Performers This Week in EuropeCorn (XBM24) +5.30%: European corn is moving above the 10  20  and 50 EMA in an uptrend. From the 168 minimum from Feb. 19  this has been a solid rally with less volatility in the last sessions. Euronext Commitments of Traders report for May 10 shows additional investors adding to the net long positions.There are concerns about dry weather in Russia mixed with severe rains early in May in southern Brazil. Russia's 2024 wheat crop now is estimated at 91 million metric tons  down from 93 million tons  and it might get worse as the weather is particularly dry so far this season.The daily RSI at 65.4 still might have more sessions to run  but once above 70 we note many pullbacks on the chart. The trend continues up.Copper Grade A 3M Cash (P0Y00) +5.25%:This industrial metal  a key barometer for inflation and activity  is firmly on an uptrend since March 13. LME copper stocks are at 104 425t as of May 15  a significant decline from the191 925 near-term peak  set in October. There are reports about copper shortages in the market.Also  the last report on UK LME Copper Future and Options Manage Money Net Position marks a record 63 247 contracts  which is supporting the current boom.Candles are showing successive higher highs and higher lows together with a widening upward spread between all 10 and 20 EMAs. The 10 EMA acts as a very reliable dynamic support which has been an ideal entry for long traders so far. Any full candle below the 10 EMA should sound alarms on existing long positions.The daily RSI marking 71.31 is entering the overbought area. However  we see that statistically only levels above 75 produced important pullbacks - something to watch closely for long traders.A recent S&P Global report states that achieving net-zero carbon emission targets would likely entail a doubling of annual copper demand by 2035 to 50 million metric tons.Facing strong historical resistance at the 10 700 level plus the mentioned record net position have both historically triggered reversals. For now  the trend is your friend.Nickel 3M Cash (P8Y00) +1.58%: Nickel keeps running the uptrend well above the 10  20  and 50 EMA. The market is using the 20 EMA as an effective dynamic support from the last 30 daily sessions. Volume is also trading above average in recent sessions  north of 6 500 contracts per day.There are reported new fund positions and news of supply shortages in New Caledonia as a result of political unrest there. New Caledonia is one of the top nickel mining regions globally. Prices look set to break the fundamental 20 000 mark soon  and we could be in for a rally if the supply issues are not addressed soon.Negative Performers This Week in EuropeWhite Sugar #5(SWQ24)-6.85%: We have bearish news from Brazil  as sugar industry group UNICA reported on Wednesday that sugar production in the Centre-South region totaled 1.84 million tons in the second half of April  up 84.25% from the same period a year earlier. The general downward movement in all soft commodities this week is also supporting the direction.The daily RSI is marking 29  which is extreme oversold. On the 3 previous dates when the indicator crossed down the critical 30 level - in June 2023  December 2023 and April 2024 - the market experienced a turnaround.Also note that 530 is an important historical support  so it's not clear how much steam is left to continue the selling pressure.UK Natural Gas Jun 24 (NFM24) -3.37%:UK nat gas is stuck in a range  as anticipated in my previous articles. All of the EMAs are very close to each other  and price action shows very little volatility. The 50 EMA is still acting as strong support  but for now the supply and demand seems to have found a balance in the absence of major news.Storage levels across Europe remain at 64%  and it is expected by most analysts that Europe will achieve 100% storage at the start of the heating season. So  any starting rally looks like will be contained.Robusta Coffee 10-T (RMN24) -0.55%: Following a pattern similar to cocoa  European robusta coffee also had its crash breaking down the 10  20  and 50 EMAs from its 4 338 top on April 25. The daily RSI hit 32.83 on May 7  and from there made an impressive turnaround. Near 30  at the oversold level  the RSI seems to be an effective tool so far.Roasters are looking for more affordable blend options and as arabica prices had its boom and crash  robusta (the less preferred category) is following suit.The main reasons for the price action were dry conditions in Brazil  and more recently in Vietnam  plus the ongoing Red Sea crisis and its effect on trade routes. Reports of recovery in ICE robusta coffee inventories also put downward pressure in prices this week  together with fund liquidations. The overall picture remains mixed  with dryness still an issue in Brazil.,neutral,0.03,0.58,0.39,mixed,0.28,0.23,0.49,True,English,"['European Commodities', 'Cocoa Prices', 'Fundamentals', 'recent S&P Global report', 'Copper Grade A 3M Cash', 'net-zero carbon emission targets', 'top nickel mining regions', '10-unit exponential moving average', 'UK LME Copper Future', '2035 to 50 million metric tons', 'recent World Cocoa Conference', 'Nickel 3M Cash', 'LME copper stocks', 'UK Natural Gas', 'UK nat gas', 'devastating bean disease', '91 million metric tons', 'Money Net Position', 'widening upward spread', 'general downward movement', 'historical record run', 'record net position', 'reliable dynamic support', 'effective dynamic support', 'reliable entry point', 'successive higher highs', 'annual copper demand', 'strong historical resistance', 'net long positions', 'existing long positions', 'important historical support', 'new fund positions', 'daily RSI marking', 'light positive news', 'last 30 daily sessions', 'recent sessions', '93 million tons', '1.84 million tons', 'copper shortages', 'last report', 'Traders report', 'strong support', 'speculative positions', 'Positive Performers', 'higher lows', 'ideal entry', 'long traders', 'important pullbacks', 'New Caledonia', 'The RSI', 'last days', 'last sessions', 'record 63,247 contracts', 'impressive crash', 'first move', 'short term', 'next sessions', 'oversold area', 'extreme volatility', 'Ivory Coast', 'third year', 'next crop', 'fundamental situation', 'record-low liquidity', 'European corn', 'less volatility', 'Euronext Commitments', 'additional investors', 'severe rains', '2024 wheat crop', 'many pullbacks', 'industrial metal', 'key barometer', 'significant decline', '191,925 near-term peak', 'current boom', 'full candle', 'overbought area', 'political unrest', 'fundamental 20,000 mark', 'Negative Performers', 'bearish news', 'industry group', 'Centre-South region', 'second half', 'same period', 'soft commodities', '3 previous dates', 'selling pressure', 'previous articles', 'price action', 'little volatility', 'major news', 'bad weather', 'production increase', 'dry weather', 'supply shortages', 'supply issues', 'White Sugar', 'solid rally', 'southern Brazil', 'Storage levels', 'sugar production', 'Europe Corn', 'critical 30 level', 'The 10 EMA', 'The 50 EMA', '6,500 contracts', '10,700 level', '20 EMA', 'CAN24', 'April', 'start', 'September', 'bears', 'charge', 'prices', '50 EMAs', 'Ghana', 'result', 'deficit', 'Brussels', 'October-March', 'majority', 'market', 'XBM24', 'uptrend', '168 minimum', 'Feb.', 'May', 'concerns', 'Russia', 'chart', 'P0Y00', 'inflation', 'activity', 'reports', 'Options', 'Candles', 'alarms', 'something', 'doubling', 'reversals', 'friend', 'P8Y00', 'Volume', 'UNICA', 'Wednesday', 'direction', 'indicator', 'June', 'December', 'turnaround', 'steam', 'NFM24', 'range', 'balance', 'absence', '10, 20', '75']",2024-05-17,2024-05-17,theglobeandmail.com
