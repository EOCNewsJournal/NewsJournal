This focus comes at a...,As of May 2024  the Euronext Amsterdam is witnessing a keen interest in dividend stocks amid fluctuating global economic conditions. This focus comes at a time when investors are increasingly seeking stable returns in a landscape marked by varying central bank policies and economic uncertainties across Europe. In this context  understanding what constitutes a good dividend stock involves looking for companies with consistent payout histories  robust financial health  and the potential to sustain or grow dividends even during economic downturns. These qualities become particularly appealing as they can offer investors a degree of predictability and security amidst broader market volatility.Top 5 Dividend Stocks In The NetherlandsName Dividend Yield Dividend Rating Acomo (ENXTAM:ACOMO) 6.52% ★★★★★☆ ABN AMRO Bank (ENXTAM:ABN) 9.60% ★★★★☆☆ Van Lanschot Kempen (ENXTAM:VLK) 9.99% ★★★★☆☆ Randstad (ENXTAM:RAND) 4.51% ★★★★☆☆ Koninklijke KPN (ENXTAM:KPN) 4.33% ★★★★☆☆ Koninklijke Heijmans (ENXTAM:HEIJM) 4.90% ★★★★☆☆Click here to see the full list of 6 stocks from our Top Euronext Amsterdam Dividend Stocks screener.Underneath we present a selection of stocks filtered out by our screen.Simply Wall St Dividend Rating: ★★★★☆☆Overview: Koninklijke Heijmans N.V. operates in property development  construction  and infrastructure sectors primarily in the Netherlands and abroad  with a market capitalization of approximately €487.16 million.Operations: Koninklijke Heijmans N.V. generates revenue through its Real Estate segment (€411.79 million)  Van Wanrooij division (€124.76 million)  Infrastructure Works (€800.03 million)  and Construction & Technology sector (€1.08 billion).Dividend Yield: 4.9%Koninklijke Heijmans exhibits a mixed performance as a dividend stock. While the company maintains a low payout ratio of 37.1%  ensuring earnings sufficiently cover dividend payments  its dividend history shows volatility over the past decade  indicating some level of unpredictability in returns to shareholders. Furthermore  despite a reasonable cash payout ratio of 59%  the annual growth in earnings (19.4% over five years) and an upcoming stock split suggest potential for future stability and growth in shareholder value. However  its current dividend yield at 4.9% remains below the top quartile of Dutch dividend payers.Story continuesENXTAM:HEIJM Dividend History as at May 2024Simply Wall St Dividend Rating: ★★★★☆☆Overview: Randstad N.V. specializes in offering a range of work and human resources services  with a market capitalization of approximately €8.96 billion.Operations: Unfortunately  the provided text does not include specific details on Randstad N.V.'s revenue segments in terms of numerical values or descriptions  so I'm unable to summarize this information into a sentence.Dividend Yield: 4.5%Randstad N.V. faces challenges as a dividend stock with its 4.51% yield trailing the top Dutch payers and a history of unstable dividends over the past decade. Despite this  dividends are sustainable with a payout ratio of 73.4% and cash payout ratio at 45.9%  indicating coverage by both earnings and cash flows. Recent financials show a dip in Q1 sales to €5.94 billion from €6.52 billion year-over-year  with net income also down to €88 million from €154 million  reflecting potential pressures on future dividend reliability.ENXTAM:RAND Dividend History as at May 2024Simply Wall St Dividend Rating: ★★★★☆☆Overview: Van Lanschot Kempen NV  operating both in the Netherlands and internationally  offers a range of financial services with a market capitalization of approximately €1.69 billion.Operations: Van Lanschot Kempen NV generates revenue primarily through two segments: €41 million from Investment Banking Clients and €83.10 million from Wholesale & Institutional Clients.Dividend Yield: 10%Van Lanschot Kempen  trading at a reasonable price-to-earnings ratio of 12.9x  below the Dutch market average of 18.8x  has shown significant profit growth with a net income increase to €125.2 million from €84.16 million year-over-year. Despite only initiating dividends three years ago  the company has consistently raised its dividend payout  proposing an increase to €2.00 per share for 2023 from €1.75 previously. However  its dividend history remains relatively short and unstable over this period; yet with a current payout ratio of 70.9%  dividends are well-covered by earnings which are forecasted to grow by 4.22% annually.ENXTAM:VLK Dividend History as at May 2024Seize The OpportunityAccess the full spectrum of 6 Top Euronext Amsterdam Dividend Stocks by clicking on this link.Have you diversified into these companies?

I would like to thank Crédit Argicole Assurances as well as HLD Europe  Flat Footed and Leima Valeurs  for their support in the execution of this plan and more widely for their support and commitment to our corporate purpose  our values and strategy  at a time when the assistance and care needs of vulnerable people have never been so great.""Nicolas Denis  Chief Executive Officer of Crédit Agricole Assurances  said: ""Crédit Agricole Assurance  as a long-standing shareholder of Clariane  has been strongly involved since November 2023 in accompanying the Company in the different parts of its refinancing plan. We are today delighted by the interest and support in the capital increase from these new financial partners. Their support  together with ours  confirms the relevance of the refinancing plan and Clariane’s corporate project  aiming to reinforce the value creation and the confidence of all its financial partners.""Jean-Bernard Lafonta  President of HLD Europe  said: ""Clariane is a European leader playing a major role in public health  particularly in the care of our elderly in nursing homes. Clariane has encountered difficulties in the context of the macro-economic shocks following the pandemic and the very rapid rise in inflation. We became convinced that the quality of care offered by Clariane was an important priority and that this group was perfectly equipped to face the very significant challenges of an ageing population by 2030.HLD has a great deal of experience in the healthcare sector  having in particular created a European leader: Santé Cie  which supports more than 200 000 patients at home  particularly those suffering from chronic illnesses. We will put our experience as a shareholder at the disposal of the Clariane group and Its management  to support its development in line with its purpose and values.""*Regulatory News:NOT FOR DISTRIBUTION IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA  CANADA  AUSTRALIA OR JAPAN. THIS PRESS RELEASE DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN OFFER OF SECURITIES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA OR ANY OTHER COUNTRY.Clariane (Paris:CLARI) today announces the proposed structure of the capital increase part of the plan to strengthen its financial structure as announced on 14 November 2023.At the Combined General Meeting on 26 March  98% of shareholders voted in favour of a capital increase with preferential subscription rights of shareholders for a maximum nominal amount of €300 million  which Predica subsidiary of Crédit Agricole Assurances  the Company's largest shareholder with 24.6% of the capital  has undertaken to underwrite  if necessary  up to a maximum amount of €200 million.As part of the preparations for this transaction  the Company has received various expressions of interest from both existing shareholders and third-party investors to support the Group's debt reduction strategy and make a long-term commitment  alongside Crédit Agricole Assurances  to work with the Group's management to support its strategy 'At your side''  and offering to acquire a significant stake in the company or strengthen their capital position and underwrite the capital increase with preferential subscription rights approved by the General Meeting of shareholders on 26 March 2024.After examining these expressions of interest during the Board of Directors meeting on 14 May 2024  Clariane agreed to structure the capital increase in two stages  in order to allow the entry of a new long-term investor by ensuring a significant shareholding and to ensure the execution of the total amount of the capital increase and maintaining the preferential subscription rights.At the next Combined General Meeting of Shareholders  to be held on 10 June 2024  the company will therefore be proposing a reserved capital increase totalling c. €92.1 million  to the benefit of the investment group HLD Europe for €74.1 million  acquiring a 20.0% stake in Clariane. HLD Europe has also undertaken  under the usual conditions  to subscribe to the capital increase with preferential subscription rights.HLD Europe is a recognised private equity group  backed by leading French entrepreneurs  which supports European companies with high growth potential  particularly in the healthcare and essential services sectors. Through this transaction  HLD Europe would become one of the Group's main shareholders.The company will also be proposing to the Combined General Meeting of Shareholders that this reserved capital increase should be subscribed  under the usual conditions  by the investment funds Flat Footed for c. € 15 million and Leima Valeurs for c. € 3 million  these investors presently own 8.6% and 5.0% respectively of the company's capital  they have also undertaken to subscribe to the capital increase with preferential subscription rights.The reserved capital increase  if approved  would be carried out at a price of €2.60 per new share; which represents a discount of 4.3% versus the volume-weighted average trading price (VWAP1 ) of the Clariane shares over the period from 26 April 2024  the date of publication of the revenue figures for the 1er quarter  to 14 May 2024 of €2.7179 (including all trading platforms in Europe) and would be launched on 10 June 2024  subject to approval by the Autorité des Marchés Financiers (""AMF"") of the prospectus relating to the reserved capital increase and to the approval of the Combined General Meeting of Shareholders with a majority of two-thirds of the votes of the shareholders present or represented. Following this transaction  HLD Europe  Flat Footed and Leima Valeurs would hold approximately 20%  10.5% and 4.6% respectively of Clariane's share capital.The reserved capital increase would result in the issue of 35 423 076 new shares corresponding to 33% of the share capital today. On the basis of the company's current (non-diluted) share capital  a shareholder owning 1% of the share capital before the transaction would be diluted to 0.75% of the share capital after completion of the reserved capital increase.Crédit Agricole Assurances and Holding Malakoff Humanis have already announced that they will vote in favour of the resolutions necessary to the reserved capital increase.The reserved capital increase would be followed by a capital increase with preferential subscription rights open to all shareholders  as authorised by the Combined General Meeting of Shareholders on 26 March 2024  for an amount of approximately €236 million. This capital increase is expected to be carried out at a discount of between 40% and 50% to the theoretical ex-rights price based on the closing price of the company's shares on the trading day preceding approval by the Autorité des Marchés Financiers of the prospectus relating to the capital increase with preferential subscription rights  in line with market practice for comparable transactions.The total amount of the planned capital increases would therefore amount to a maximum of approximately €328 million.The company has received commitments from Crédit Agricole Assurances  HLD Europe  Flat Footed and Leima Valeurs covering the full amount of this second capital increase with preferential subscription rights.These commitments in connection with this second capital increase are as follows:Crédit Agricole Assurance via its subsidary Predica: up to a maximum shareholding of 29.9% of Clariane's capital and voting rights following the capital increases 2    HLD Europe: for a maximum of €83.2 million  up to a maximum shareholding of 29.9% of Clariane's capital and voting rights following the capital increases Flat Footed: for a maximum of c. €65 million Leima Valeurs: for a maximum of c. €27 million.The fulfilment of these undertakings  which have been the subject of firm agreements between the company and each of the parties concerned  remains subject to a favourable vote of the necessary resolutions at the Combined General Meeting of Clariane shareholders convened for 10 June 2024  to the approval of the prospectuses corresponding to these transaction and the preparation of a fairness opinion by Finexsi. The company's Board of Directors has voluntarily appointed Finexsi  acting as an independent expert  to provide a fairness opinion on the reserved capital increase  which will be made available to shareholders prior to the General Meeting. A fairness opinion will also be delivered for the capital increase with preferential subscription rights  and will be available in the prospectus relating to this operation.Flat Footed is expected to apply for prior authorisation under Article L. 151-3 of the French Monetary and Financial Code to subscribe to capital increases  due to the crossing of the threshold of 10% of the votes in the company.Shareholders are reminded that this second capital increase provides for the maintenance of their preferential subscription rights and that they may therefore subscribe to this capital increase in order to maintain their shareholding by benefiting from the discount. Otherwise  shareholders who do not wish to exercise their preferential subscription rights will be subject to significant dilution  which may be offset in whole or in part by the sale of their preferential subscription rights.In addition  and in accordance with the undertakings it gave when it became a purpose driven company (Société à Mission) in 2023 and the resolutions adopted by the Combined General Meeting of 26 March 2024  the company plans to launch  depending on market conditions  in the coming months  a capital increase reserved for its employees  which will enable them to be fully involved in the Group's refinancing and development plan.The capital increases announced today are the third part of the plan announced by the Group on 14 November 2023 to strengthen its financial structure and reduce its debt.This plan  totalling €1.5 billion  has been put in place to resolve the difficulties in accessing the financing markets.In December 2023  the Company completed the first two parts of this plan:The completion of the ""Gingko"" real-estate partnership for €140 million on 15 December 2023  followed by the completion of the ""Juniper"" real-estate partnership for €90 million on 28 December 2023 with Credit Agricole Assurances via Its subsidary Predica; Crédit Agricole Assurances was reimbursed €90 million following the sale of the UK assets by Clariane in March 2024;The arrangement and drawdown of a €200 million term loan with Caisse Régionale de Crédit Agricole Mutuel de Paris et d'Ile de France (CADIF)  LCL and Crédit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank (CACIB).At the same time  the Group has also embarked on the fourth part of the plan  a programme of disposals of operating and real-estate assets  as well as capital partnerships  with expected gross proceeds of approximately €1 billion. With the disposals in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands and the planned sale of its Hospitalisation à Domicile (HAD) business in France announced on 6 May 2024  which received a favourable opinion from employee representative bodies on 14 May 2024  the Group has already completed around 40% of this total disposal programme.Crédit Agricole Assurances  aiming to maintain its present shareholding in Clariane following the two capital increases at least the level of 24.6% its holds presently  has signed an agreement with Holding Malakoff Humanis to acquire in the context of the capital increase with preferential subscription rights  part or all of the subscription rights depending on the final terms of the capital of the capital increase  with the intention to exercise the rights acquired.Clariane specifies that  in accordance with the separate agreements signed with HLD  Flat Footed and Leima Valeurs  the transactions described in this press release  namely a capital increase of approximately €92.1 million reserved for HLD  Flat Footed LLC and Leima Valeur followed by a capital increase with shareholders' preferential subscription rights for a maximum amount of approximately €236 million  with the individual subscription commitments from these three investors and Credit Agricole Assurances  form an indissociable whole.If the reserved capital increase is not approved by the General Meeting of Shareholders on 10 June 2024  neither of these two capital increases will be carried out.In this case  Clariane would not be in a position to carry out a capital increase of €300 million in June or July 2024  as provided for in its capital strengthening plan. Clariane would therefore have to examine ways of carrying out this capital increase in September 2024 on the basis of the resolution passed by the General Meeting of Shareholders on 26 March 2024. This would involve identifying investors or banks capable of guaranteeing the portion not guaranteed by Predica  and satisfying the conditions precedent to Crédit Agricole Assurances' guarantee commitment of €200 million specified in the press release of 14 November 2023 still outstanding  namely (i) obtaining authorisations from the relevant competition authorities for the possible takeover of Clariane by Crédit Agricole Assurances  (ii) obtaining an amendment to the terms and conditions of the contract for the issue of Oceanes maturing in 2027 (0.875% - FR 0013489739) in order to exclude early redemption in the event that Crédit Agricole Assurances crosses the 40% threshold in terms of voting rights  (iii) the independent expert Finexsi delivers a fairness opinion and (iv) the Autorité des Marchés Financiers approval of the prospectus relating to the capital increase.There is no guarantee that Clariane will succeed in carrying out a capital increase of €300 million within the required timeframe. Failing to do so  Clariane would have to place itself under a protection regime adapted to renegotiate its debt with its creditors.The Board of Directors has decided to propose to the Combined General Meeting to be held on 10 June 2024 the appointment of three directors  subject to the approval by this meeting of the resolutions relating to the reserved capital increase. One of whom with replace the representative of Malakoff Humanis whose mandate is expiring. The appointment of these new directors would take effect after completion of the reserved capital increase.Two of these candidates  whose appointment would take effect after the completion of the reserved capital increase  would be nominated by HLD Europe. In this case HLD Europe has given the Company an undertaking that in case the shareholding of HLD were to fall below 20% one of the Directors would have to resign and both in the case the shareholding were to fall and remain below 10% for 24 months.A third candidate would be nominated by Leima Valeurs  who has given the Company an undertaking that this director would have to resign if  within 24 months of his appointment  the shareholding did not reach at least 10% of the share capital  or at a later date if the shareholding were to fall below 10%.The composition of Clariane's Board of Directors would remain balanced and in line with the AFEP-MEDEF Code.The Board would have 16 members  including 8 independent members  2 representatives for both Crédit Agricole Assurances and HLD Europe  one representative for Leima Valeurs  the CEO who also has a mandate as a Director  and 2 members representing the employees  chaired by Mr. Jean-Pierre Duprieu  one of the independent members.The composition of the committees would also be modified  with in particular the presence of a member proposed by HLD Europe on the Audit Committee  the Remuneration and Appointments Committee  the Investment Committee and the Ethics  Quality and CSR Committee.Crédit Agricole Assurances  HLD Europe  Flat Footed and Leima Valeurs have each undertaken not to acquire shares of Clariane following the transactions as far as the acquisition of these shares could lead them (including the shares held by any entity of their group) to cross the threshold of 30% of the capital or the voting rights of Clariane  these undertakings are for a period of 12 months for Crédit Agricole Assurances and 36 months for HLD Europe  Flat Footed and Leima Valeurs. HLD Europe  Flat Footed and Leima Valeurs have also undertaken to hold the shares subscribed under the reserved capital increase for a period of 18 months following the completion of the transactions.Finally  Credit Agricole Assurances  HLD Europe  Flat Footed and Leima Valeurs are not acting In concert and have Indicated having no Intention to act in concert.Due to the calendar of the transactions described in this press release  the Company announces that it will postpone the publication date of its first half results to 5 August 2024.* * *About HLD EuropeFounded in 2010 by a group of entrepreneurs  HLD is a permanent European investment group with operations in Luxembourg  France  Switzerland  the Netherlands and Italy.

The gradual recovery of our activity in China  which remained well below pre-covid levels  is continuing with a high single-digit organic revenue growth rate this quarter.As far as Q2 is concerned  we expect organic revenue growth around +12.0% driven by continued strong digital revenue growth across all business segments and including the positive impact of the Paris Olympics and the UEFA Euro 2024 in Germany.We are confident that Out of Home (OOH) will continue to grow its market share in a fragmented media landscape with Digital Out of Home (DOOH) being the fastest growing media segment. JCDecaux as the industry leader and the most digitised global OOH Media company is well positioned to benefit from this digital transformation.”Following the adoption of IFRS 11 from January 1st  2014  the operating data presented below is adjusted to include our prorata share in companies under joint control.Please refer to the paragraph “Adjusted data” of this release for the definition of adjusted data and reconciliation with IFRS.The values shown in the tables are generally expressed in millions of euros. The sum of the rounded amounts or variations calculations may differ  albeit to an insignificant extent  from the reported values.Adjusted revenue for the first quarter 2024 increased by +11.1% to €801.6 million compared to €721.3 million in the first quarter of 2023.Excluding the negative impact from foreign exchange variations and the positive impact of changes in perimeter  adjusted revenue increased by +11.0%.Adjusted advertising revenue  excluding revenue related to sale  rental and maintenance of street furniture and advertising displays  increased by +12.0% on an organic basis in the first quarter of 2024.By activity:Q1 adjusted revenue 2024 (€m) 2023 (€m) Reported growth Organic growth(a) Street Furniture 400.8 364.3 +10.0% +9.2% Transport 288.2 254.0 +13.5% +15.1% Billboard 112.6 103.0 +9.4% +7.0% Total 801.6 721.3 +11.1% +11.0%a.

Most geographies grew double-digit. Transport remained meaningfully impacted by the lower level of activity in China compared to pre-covid.BILLBOARDFirst quarter adjusted revenue increased by +9.4% to €112.6 million (+7.0% on an organic basis) driven by the most digitised markets  while France decreased due to the ongoing rationalisation of our inventory in line with regulations. UK and Rest of the World were the drivers of growth with a double-digit increase.ADJUSTED DATAUnder IFRS 11  applicable from January 1st  2014  companies under joint control are accounted for using the equity method.However  in order to reflect the business reality of the Group  operating data of the companies under joint control will continue to be proportionately integrated in the operating management reports used by directors to monitor the activity  allocate resources and measure performance.Consequently  pursuant to IFRS 8  Segment Reporting presented in the financial statements complies with the Group’s internal information  and the Group’s external financial communication therefore relies on this operating financial information.

The Company anticipates that the ADS Ratio Change will be effective on or about June 3rd  2024 (the “Effective Date”).For the Company’s ADS holders  the change in the ADS Ratio will have the same effect as a one-for-two reverse ADS split and is intended to enable the Company to regain compliance with the Nasdaq minimum bid price requirement. On the Effective Date  registered holders of company ADSs held in certificated form will be required on a mandatory basis to surrender their certificated ADSs to the depositary bank for cancellation and will receive one (1) new ADS in exchange for every two existing ADSs surrendered. Holders of uncertificated ADSs in the Direct Registration System (“DRS”) and in The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) will have their ADSs automatically exchanged and need not take any action. The exchange of every two existing ADSs then-held for one (1) new ADS will occur automatically  at the Effective Date  with the then-held ADSs being cancelled and new ADSs being issued by the depositary bank. DBV’s ADSs will continue to be traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the ticker symbol “DBVT”.No fractional new ADSs will be issued in connection with the change in the ADS Ratio. Instead  fractional entitlements to new ADSs will be aggregated and sold by the depositary bank and the net cash proceeds from the sale of the fractional ADS entitlements (after deduction of fees  taxes and expenses) will be distributed to the applicable ADS holders by the depositary bank. The ADS Ratio Change will have no impact on DBV’s underlying ordinary shares  and no ordinary shares will be issued or cancelled in connection with the ADS Ratio Change.As a result of the change in the ADS Ratio  DBV’s ADS trading price is expected to increase proportionally  although the Company can give no assurance that the ADS trading price after the ADS Ratio Change will be equal to or greater than twice the ADS trading price before the change.About DBV TechnologiesDBV Technologies is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing treatment options for food allergies and other immunologic conditions with significant unmet medical need. DBV is currently focused on investigating the use of its proprietary technology platform  Viaskin™  to address food allergies  which are caused by a hypersensitive immune reaction and characterized by a range of symptoms varying in severity from mild to life-threatening anaphylaxis. Millions of people live with food allergies  including young children. Through epicutaneous immunotherapy (EPIT™)  the Viaskin platform is designed to introduce microgram amounts of a biologically active compound to the immune system through intact skin. EPIT is a new class of non-invasive treatment that seeks to modify an individual’s underlying allergy by re-educating the immune system to become desensitized to allergen by leveraging the skin’s immune tolerizing properties. DBV is committed to transforming the care of food allergic people. The Company’s food allergy programs include ongoing clinical trials of Viaskin Peanut in peanut allergic toddlers (1 through 3 years of age) and children (4 through 7 years of age).DBV Technologies is headquartered in Châtillon  France  with North American operations in Warren  NJ. The Company’s ordinary shares are traded on segment B of Euronext Paris (Ticker: DBV  ISIN code: FR0010417345) and the Company’s ADSs (each representing one-half of one ordinary share) are traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market (Ticker: DBVT  CUSIP: 23306J101).For more information  please visit www.dbv-technologies.com and engage with us on X (formerly Twitter) and LinkedIn.Forward Looking StatementsThis press release may contain forward-looking statements and estimates  including the expected impact of the ADS Ratio Change on DBV’s trading price and ability to maintain compliance with the Nasdaq minimum bid price requirement.
