(Euronext: ONWD)  the medical technology company creating innovative spinal cord stimulation therapies to restore movement  function  and independence in people with spinal cord injury (SCI)  today announces the publication of global Up-LIFT pivotal trial results in Nature Medicine. The study achieved all primary safety and effectiveness endpoints  and ARC-EX Therapy demonstrated significant improvements in upper limb strength  function  and sensation among people with chronic tetraplegia due to cervical SCI.ADVERTISEMENTAt the end of the trial  72% of trial participants were considered responders to non-invasive ARC-EX Therapy* based on a conservative definition requiring responders to meet improvement criteria in both strength and functional domains vs. standard of care rehabilitation alone. Notably  the number of responders increased to 90% when the definition included participants with improvements in at least one strength or functional outcome*.“Trial results far exceeded our hypothesis of a 50% response rate to ARC-EX Therapy  giving new hope to people with SCI and to rehabilitation providers ” said Chet Moritz  Ph.D.  publication lead author  co-Principal Investigator  and Professor of Electrical & Computer Engineering and Rehabilitation Medicine at the University of Washington. “After only two months  more than half of Up-LIFT participants achieved average improvements in grasp force greater than that required to lift filled cups and in pinch force equivalent to that required to pick up an item with a fork or insert a key.1 2 This indicates not only improved strength and function  but also the potential for greater independence with ARC-EX Therapy.”Story continuesDesigned to restore movement of the upper limbs after spinal cord injuryStudy participants also reported reduced spasm frequency  improved sleep  and improved upper body sensation  including the sense of touch*. 87% of participants reported that ARC-EX Therapy delivered improvements in overall quality of life*. Self-care  a key component of independence after SCI  also improved significantly*.“Improvement in arm and hand function is among the highest priorities for people with tetraplegia3 who have endured far too long without effective therapies for functional recovery ” said Dave Marver  CEO  ONWARD Medical. “The findings published in Nature Medicine provide critical and compelling evidence that ARC-EX has the potential to restore independence in daily activities and improve quality of life. We are laser-focused on our commitment to bring this first-of-its-kind technology to the SCI Community as soon as possible.”“We are proud that ONWARD has developed this first-ever therapy shown to improve strength and function after chronic incomplete tetraplegia ” said ONWARD Medical co-founders Grégoire Courtine  PhD  Professor of Neuroscience and Neurotechnology at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL)  and Jocelyne Bloch  MD  Head of Functional Neurosurgery at Lausanne University Hospital and Professor of Neurosurgery at EPFL. “We commend the outstanding researchers and study participants who contributed to this seminal trial.”ARC-EX Therapy is external  programmed electrical stimulation that targets the spinal cord non-invasively and is designed to aid in functional recovery after SCI. The Up-LIFT study was a prospective  single-arm pivotal study designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the ARC-EX System to treat upper extremity functional deficits in people with chronic tetraplegia. The global study was conducted with 65 participants at 14 leading SCI centers in the United States  Europe  and Canada.At the end of Q1  ONWARD Medical submitted a De Novo application to the US Food and Drug Administration for market clearance of the ARC-EX System. The Company plans to follow the US application with an application for market approval in Europe.On Thursday  May 23rd at 2:30pm CET/8:30am ET following a brief Q1 Business Update  CEO Dave Marver will host a discussion of Up-LIFT pivotal trial results with a panel of principal investigators and study participants.To join the webcast via Zoom  please register using this link.Participants may also join by phone:+32 2 290 9360 (Belgium)+33 1 7037 2246 (France)+49 69 3807 9884 (Germany)+31 20 794 0854 (Netherlands)+41 22 591 0156 (Switzerland)+44 203 481 5240 (United Kingdom)+1 346 248 7799 (US)Additional telephone numbers availableMeeting ID: 879 5741 2479A recording of the webcast will be available on the Company’s website following the live event.Note: All ONWARD® Medical devices and therapies  including but not limited to ARC-IM®  ARC-EX®  ARC-BCI™  and ARC Therapy™  alone or in combination with a brain-computer interface (BCI)  are investigational and not available for commercial use.About ONWARD MedicalONWARD® Medical is a medical technology company creating therapies to restore movement  function  and independence in people with spinal cord injury (SCI) and movement disabilities.
