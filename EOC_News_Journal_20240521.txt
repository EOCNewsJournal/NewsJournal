The share of the precious metal in reserves climbed to 4.9% in April  the highest since records began in 2015  according to the People’s Bank of China.,neutral,0.03,0.87,0.1,negative,0.02,0.34,0.64,True,English,"['record amount', 'dollar assets', 'China', 'data', 'second largest foreign holder', 'The Brussels-based clearinghouse Euroclear', 'rising geopolitical tensions', 'Fed rate-cut cycle', 'chief Asia foreign-exchange', 'US-China trade war', 'first three months', 'foreign exchange reserves', 'other G7 countries', 'Russian sovereign funds', 'US borrowing costs', 'US Treasury Department', 'Treasury Department data', 'US dollar-denominated assets', 'US Treasury assets', 'US Treasury securities', 'US dollar holdings', 'The West', 'Treasury market', 'dollar assets', 'Russian assets', 'US securities', 'first quarter', 'other commodities', 'US bonds', 'Russian reserves', 'record number', 'latest data', 'agency bonds', 'same time', 'broader strategy', 'economic impact', 'Ukraine conflict', 'similar risks', 'Craig Shapiro', 'macroeconomic adviser', 'LaDuc Trading', 'reporting period', 'clear intention', 'Stephen Chiu', 'rates strategist', 'official reserves', 'precious metal', 'US Treasuries', 'Western sanctions', 'Bloomberg Intelligence', 'Beijing', 'year', 'country', 'shift', 'total', 'purchases', 'gold', 'analysts', 'reduction', 'experts', 'handling', 'threats', 'expropriations', 'exposure', 'Newsweek', 'Saturday', 'seizure', 'start', 'custodian', 'Japan', 'sell-off', 'economists', 'fact', 'selling', 'Trump', 'president', 'share', 'April', 'records', 'People', 'Bank']",2024-05-20,2024-05-21,rt.com

(“BMS”) for a total equity value of approximately $14 billion (the “Transaction”). The Company received approximately $293 million gross proceeds from the sale of its Karuna equity position. In addition  the Company is eligible to receive further milestones and royalty payments based on certain regulatory and commercial successes.On 25 April 2024  the Company published its annual report and accounts for the year ending 31 December 2023 (“2023 Annual Report”). The Annual Report included an update on subsequent events following the financial year end up to 25 April 2024. The Company’s performance and outlook has continued in line with expectations since the publication of the 2023 Annual Report.As stated in the 2023 Annual Report  the Company determines its capital allocation with a measured approach that balances support for its current internal and founded entity programs and the funding of future innovation  with the goal of maximising Shareholder returns. The Board will assess ongoing opportunities to improve Shareholder returns  including additional capital returns to Shareholders from future monetisation events  while maintaining a cash runway of at least three years to support its internal programs  founded entities  future innovation and operational needs. The Board has determined that the Tender Offer would be the most suitable way of returning a proportion of the proceeds of the Transaction to Shareholders in a quick and efficient manner  taking account of the relative costs  complexity and timeframes of the possible methods available.Subject to the passing of the Resolution by Shareholders at the General Meeting  the Directors will give Shareholders the opportunity to tender Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs) through the Tender Offer for cash only. The Resolution will give the Directors authority to acquire up to 33 500 000 Ordinary Shares at a fixed tender price of 250 pence per Ordinary Share (the “Tender Price”).Tenders will only be accepted at the Tender Price. Subject to satisfaction of the Tender Conditions to the Tender Offer  Ordinary Shares which are successfully tendered under the Tender Offer will be purchased at the Tender Price.If the full amount of the $100 million is not returned through the Tender Offer  and if there is sufficient surplus  the Board intends to return such surplus by way of the Special Dividend.The Issued Ordinary Share Capital on the Latest Practicable Date was 270 761 077 Ordinary Shares (excluding 18 707 082 Ordinary Shares held in treasury). If the Tender Offer is implemented in full  this will result in the purchase and cancellation of up to 33 500 000 Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs) (representing approximately 12 percent of the Issued Ordinary Share Capital of the Company on the Latest Practicable Date). Shareholders should note that the Issued Ordinary Share Capital numbers referred to in this paragraph take no account of any dilution which may be caused by the Share Plans  which is explained in further detail in the Circular.2.2 Benefits of the Tender OfferThe Board considered various options for returning cash to Shareholders and determined that the Tender Offer  together with any subsequent Special Dividend (if any)  would be the most appropriate means of returning cash to Shareholders. In particular:the Tender Offer provides those Shareholders who wish to sell Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs) with the opportunity to do so at a market-driven price with a premium as at the Latest Practicable Date;the Tender Offer enables those Shareholders who do not wish to receive capital at this time to maintain their full investment in the Company;the Tender Price represents a premium of 25 percent to PureTech’s trailing volume weighted average price per Ordinary Share over the three days prior to 19 March 2024  the date of PureTech’s initial announcement of the Tender Offer proposals and a premium of 12.6 percent to the closing price of 222 pence per Ordinary Share on the Latest Practicable Date;the Tender Offer is available to all Shareholders regardless of the size of their shareholdings; andthe Tender Offer allows the Company to broaden the scope of the return of capital to include Ordinary Shares held by those Shareholders whose Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs) might not be purchased by the Company through a share purchase programme.2.3 Principal Terms of the Tender OfferJefferies will implement the Tender Offer by acquiring  as principal  the successfully tendered Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs) at the Tender Price. Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs) purchased by Jefferies pursuant to the Tender Offer will be purchased as principal and such purchases will be market purchases in accordance with the provisions of the Act  the Prospectus Regulation Rules  the Listing Rules  the rules of the London Stock Exchange  the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules and the Takeover Code. Immediately following completion of the Tender Offer  Jefferies shall exercise its right to sell such Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs) to the Company  at the Tender Price  pursuant to the Option Agreement. If Jefferies does not exercise its right to require the Company to purchase such Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs)  the Company has the right to require Jefferies to sell such Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs) to it at the Tender Price. Purchases of Ordinary Shares by the Company pursuant to the Option Agreement will also be market purchases in accordance with the provisions of the Act  the Prospectus Regulation Rules  the Listing Rules  the rules of the London Stock Exchange  the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules and the Takeover Code.All of the Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs) purchased by the Company pursuant to the Option Agreement in connection with the Tender Offer will be cancelled. Further details on the Option Agreement are set out in Part VIII of the Circular.Shareholders can decide whether they want to tender all  some or none of their Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs) in the Tender Offer.As at the date of this announcement  it is proposed that a maximum of 33 500 000 Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs) be purchased under the Tender Offer at the Tender Price  representing approximately 12 percent of the Company’s Issued Ordinary Share Capital as at 16 May 2024  being the Latest Practicable Date  for a maximum aggregate amount of $100 million. The maximum amount of $100 million will be translated into a pounds sterling amount on the Ordinary Share Closing Date  which pounds sterling amount shall determine the maximum number of shares to be accepted for payment in the Tender Offer.Tenders in respect of Ordinary Shares may only be made at the Tender Price and tenders of ADSs may only be made at the ADS Tender Price.Each ADS represents 10 Ordinary Shares. Accordingly  the amount an ADS Holder will receive for each ADS in respect of which the underlying Ordinary Shares are successfully tendered under the Tender Offer will be an amount of £25.00 (twenty five pounds sterling)  being ten times the Tender Price  with such amounts to be converted by the Tender Agent from pounds sterling into US dollars and paid to the ADS Holder in US dollars (the “ADS Tender Price”). For illustrative purposes  the ADS Tender Price is equivalent to $31.68 per ADS (each of which represents 10 Ordinary Shares)  based on an exchange rate of pounds sterling to US dollars of £1.00 to $1.2671 (being the exchange rate on the Latest Practicable Date). The actual amount of US dollars such ADS Holder receives will depend upon the exchange rate prevailing at the time the Tender Agent converts the pounds sterling amount into US dollars.ADS Holders should be aware that the US dollar/pound sterling exchange rate that is prevailing on the date on which ADSs are tendered may be different than the US dollar/pound sterling exchange rate prevailing at the time the pounds sterling are converted into US dollars.Successfully tendered Ordinary Shares that are accepted for payment will be cancelled.Shareholders do not have to tender any Ordinary Shares if they do not wish to do so  and ADS Holders do not have to tender any ADSs if they do not wish to do so.ADS Holders should refer to Part VIII of the Circular.The Tender Offer will close at 1:00 p.m. (London time) on Thursday 20 June 2024 (and for ADS Holders at 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on Tuesday 18 June 2024) and tenders received after those times (as appropriate) will not be accepted (unless the Tender Offer is extended).Shareholders should note that  once tendered  Ordinary Shares may not be sold  transferred  charged  or otherwise disposed of other than in accordance with the Tender Offer.Shareholders who are in any doubt as to the contents of this announcement or as to the action to be taken should immediately consult their stockbroker  bank manager  solicitor  accountant  or other independent financial advisor authorised under FSMA  if taking advice in the UK or  if resident in another jurisdiction  from another appropriately authorised independent financial or professional advisor.2.4 Number of Ordinary Shares to be purchasedIf the aggregate value at the Tender Price of all validly tendered Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs) exceeds $100 million (based on the applicable exchange rate of US dollars to pounds sterling on the Ordinary Share Closing Date)  or the number of validly tendered Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs) exceeds 33 500 000 Ordinary Shares  acceptances of validly tendered Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs) will be scaled-down pro-rata to the total number of Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs) so tendered by that Shareholder  as described in paragraphs 2.14 and 2.15 of Part V of the Circular. Accordingly  where scaling-down applies  there is no guarantee that all of the Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs) which are tendered will be accepted for purchase.Successfully tendered Ordinary Shares will be purchased free of commission and dealing charges.Any Ordinary Shares repurchased by the Company from Jefferies following the purchase by Jefferies will be cancelled. Any rights of Shareholders who choose not to tender their Ordinary Shares or ADSs will be unaffected.Subject to any applicable law and regulatory requirements (including the rules and regulations of the London Stock Exchange and SEC)  the Company reserves the right at any time prior to the expiration of the Tender Offer  and with the prior consent of Jefferies  to extend the period during which the Tender Offer is open  based on market conditions and/or other factors.2.5 Circumstances in which the Tender Offer may not proceedThere is no guarantee that the Tender Offer will take place. The Tender Offer is conditional on  among other things:the passing of the Resolution at the General Meeting; receipt of valid tenders in respect of at least 2 707 611 Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs) (representing approximately one percent of the Issued Ordinary Share Capital of the Company as at the Latest Practicable Date) by 1:00 p.m. on the Ordinary Share Closing Date (unless the Tender Offer is extended); Jefferies being satisfied  acting reasonably  that  at all times up to immediately prior to the announcement of the results of the Tender Offer  the Company has complied with its obligations  and is not in breach of any of the representations and warranties given by it  under the Option Agreement; the Company continuing to have sufficient profits available for distribution to acquire  under the Option Agreement  the Ordinary Shares purchased by Jefferies pursuant to the Tender Offer; there not arising any material adverse change or certain other force majeure events prior to the closing of the Tender Offer; and certain other Tender Conditions as set out in paragraph 2.1 of Part V of the Circular.The Company has reserved the right at any time prior to the expiration of the Tender Offer  with the prior consent of Jefferies  to extend the period during which the Tender Offer is open and/or vary the aggregate value of the Tender Offer  based on market conditions and/or other factors  subject to compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Any such decision will be announced by the Company through a Regulatory Information Service and by a press release in the US.The Company may terminate the Tender Offer if the Company concludes  in its reasonable discretion  one or more of the Tender Conditions set out in paragraph 2.1 of Part V of this Tender Offer have not been satisfied.2.6 Results announcementAs set out in the expected timetable below  it is expected that the results of the Tender Offer will be announced on 24 June 2024  subject to the satisfaction of the Tender Conditions. Settlement is then expected to take place as set out in the timetable.2.7 Full terms and conditions of the Tender OfferFull details of the Tender Offer  including the terms and conditions on which it is made  are set out in Part V of the Circular. Some questions and answers related to the Tender Offer are set out in Part IV of the Circular.Further details of the Tender Offer in respect of the ADSs  including some questions and answers relating to the tender of the Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs and certain terms and conditions on which the Tender Offer is made in respect of the ADSs  are set out in Part VIII of the Circular.3. GENERAL MEETING TO APPROVE THE RESOLUTIONThe Tender Offer requires the approval by Shareholders of the Resolution at the General Meeting. For this purpose  the Company is convening the General Meeting for 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) (4:00 p.m. (London time)) on 6 June 2024 to be held at 6 Tide Street  Boston  Massachusetts  02210  United States to consider and  if thought fit  pass the Resolution to authorise and to approve the terms on which the Tender Offer will be effected. A notice convening the General Meeting is set out at the end of the Circular.The General Meeting has been convened to consider and  if thought fit  approve a resolution authorising the Company to purchase up to a maximum of 33 500 000 Ordinary Shares  representing approximately 12 percent of the Issued Ordinary Share Capital as at the Latest Practicable Date.The Company will not purchase Ordinary Shares pursuant to the Tender Offer unless the Resolution is duly passed.A summary of action to be taken by Shareholders in connection with the General Meeting is set out in paragraph 9 of Part III of the Circular  together with the notes to the Notice of General Meeting as set out in Part X of the Circular.4. TAXShareholders and ADS Holders should note that  due to the circumstances of its formation and the application of Section 7874 of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986  as amended (“Code”)  the Company is treated as a US domestic corporation for US federal income tax purposes. Accordingly  the Company is subject to US federal income tax as if it were a US corporation  and distributions made by the Company (including certain payments in respect of the Tender Offer that are treated as distributions for US federal income tax purposes) are generally treated as US-source dividends. As a result  both US Holders and Non-US Holders may be subject to US federal income tax withholding on receipt of cash proceeds from any tendered Ordinary Shares or ADSs accepted in the Tender Offer and the Special Dividend (if any).The attention of Shareholders is drawn to Part VI of the Circular  which provides a summary of certain material UK tax and US federal income tax consequences for Shareholders of accepting the Tender Offer or receipt of the Special Dividend (if any). Part VI also provides additional information to Shareholders on Section 302 Certifications  IRS Form W-9 and IRS Form W-8.This information is not tax advice. Shareholders and ADS Holders should consult their professional tax advisors  in particular regarding their individual tax position and the exemptions or reductions of US withholding tax that may be available to them.5. OVERSEAS SHAREHOLDERSThe attention of Shareholders who are not resident in  or nationals or citizens of  the United Kingdom is drawn to paragraph 5 of Part V of the Circular.6. BOARD INTENTIONSThe Company’s Chief Executive Officer  Dr Bharatt Chowrira  has confirmed that he does not intend to tender any of his current individual beneficial holding of Ordinary Shares through the Tender Offer. The remainder of the Board  comprising the Company’s interim chair and the Company’s non-executive directors  are each considering their individual position and may tender Ordinary Shares of which they are the registered or beneficial holder  or otherwise hold on trust as trustees (as applicable)  under the Tender Offer.7. RECOMMENDATION BY THE BOARDThe Directors consider that the Tender Offer is in the best interests of the Shareholders as a whole. Accordingly  the Board recommends that Shareholders vote in favour of the Resolution  as the Directors intend to do for their respective individual beneficial holdings of  in aggregate  7 938 094 Ordinary Shares  representing approximately 3 per cent. of the Issued Ordinary Share Capital of the Company as at the Latest Practicable Date.The Board makes no recommendation to Shareholders in relation to participation in the Tender Offer itself. Whether or not Shareholders decide to tender all  or any  of their Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs) will depend on  among other things  their view of the Company’s prospects and their own individual circumstances  including their own financial and tax position. Shareholders are required to take their own decision and are recommended to consult with their duly authorised independent financial or professional advisor.Appendix IExpected TimetableAnnouncement of launch of the Tender Offer  publication of the Circular and the Notice of General Meeting 20 May 2024 File Schedule TO with the SEC 20 May 2024 Tender Offer opens 20 May 2024 Latest time and date for receipt by the Depositary of voting instructions in respect of ADSs for the General Meeting 10:00 a.m. New York City time on 31 May 2024 Latest time and date for receipt of Forms of Proxy for the General Meeting 11:00 a.m. New York City time (4:00 p.m. London time) on 4 June 2024 General Meeting 11:00 a.m. New York City time (4:00 p.m. London time) on 6 June 2024 Announcement of results of the General Meeting 6 June 2024 Latest time and date for receipt by Tender Agent of Letters of Transmittal for ADSs and book-entry transfer of ADSs 5:00 p.m. New York City time on 18 June 2024 Latest time and date for receipt of Tender Forms and share certificates in relation to the Tender Offer 1:00 p.m. London time on 20 June 2024 Latest time and date for receipt of TTE Instructions in relation to the Tender Offer 1:00 p.m. London time on 20 June 2024 Announcement of results of the Tender Offer 24 June 2024 Purchase of Ordinary Shares under the Tender Offer 24 June 2024 CREST accounts credited with Tender Offer proceeds in respect of uncertificated Ordinary Shares by 25 June 2024 CREST accounts credited for revised  uncertificated holdings of Ordinary Shares (or  in the case of unsuccessful tenders  for entire holdings of Ordinary Shares) by 25 June 2024 Cheques despatched in respect of Tender Offer proceeds for Certificated Ordinary Shares by 3 July 2024 Credit of proceeds in respect of book-entry ADSs by 3 July 2024 Despatch of balance of ADSs by 3 July 2024 Cheques despatched in respect of Tender Offer proceeds for Certificated ADSs by 3 July 2024 Return of share certificates in respect of unsuccessful tenders of Certificated Ordinary Shares by 3 July 2024 Despatch of balancing share certificates (in respect of Certificated Ordinary Shares) for revised  certificated holdings in the case of partially successful tenders by 3 July 2024Notes:The dates and times set forth above are in accordance with English law and practice and are subject to the Company’s right or  upon certain conditions set forth in the US securities laws  the Company’s obligation to extend or amend the Tender Offer.References to times in this timetable are to London time (British Summer Time (BST)) or New York City time (Eastern Daylight Time (EDT)) (as stated).DefinitionsThe following definitions apply throughout this announcement  unless stated otherwise:Act the Companies Act 2006 of England and Wales  as amended from time to time ADR American Depositary Receipt representing ADSs ADS American Depositary Share  each representing 10 Ordinary Shares ADS Closing Date 5:00 p.m. New York City time on Tuesday 18 June 2024  unless the Tender Offer is extended ADS Holders the holder(s) of ADSs from time to time ADS Tender Price an amount of £25.00 (twenty five pounds sterling)  being ten times the Tender Price  with such amounts to be converted by the Tender Agent from pounds sterling into US dollars and paid to the ADS Holder in US dollars BMS Bristol Myers Squibb  Inc.

If Jefferies does not exercise its right to require the Company to purchase such Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs)  the Company has the right to require Jefferies to sell such Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs) to it at the same price. The Company intends to cancel the Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs) purchased by it pursuant to the Tender Offer.Shareholders can decide whether they want to tender all  some or none of their Ordinary Shares or ADSs in the Tender Offer.If the aggregate value at the Tender Price of all validly tendered Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs) exceeds $100 million (based on the applicable exchange rate of US dollars to pounds sterling on the Ordinary Share Closing Date) or the number of validly tendered Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs) exceeds 33 500 000 Ordinary Shares  then not all of the Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs) validly tendered will be accepted and purchased. In these circumstances  tenders will be scaled down pro-rata to the total number of Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs) so tendered by that shareholder  such that the total cost of Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs) purchased pursuant to the Tender Offer does not exceed $100 million or the total number of validly tendered Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs) does not exceed 33 500 000 Ordinary Shares.Certain US Federal Income Tax Considerations with Respect to the Tender OfferShareholders and ADS Holders should consult their professional tax advisors in connection with the Tender Offer.Shareholders and ADS Holders should note that  due to the circumstances of its formation and the application of Section 7874 of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986  as amended (Code)  the Company is treated as a US domestic corporation for US federal income tax purposes.

TENDER OFFER2.1 Background to and reasons for the Tender OfferOn 18 March 2024  the Company announced the completion of the sale of its stocks in Karuna to Bristol Myers Squibb  Inc. (BMS) for a total equity value of approximately $14 billion (the Transaction). The Company received approximately $293 million gross proceeds from the sale of its Karuna equity position. In addition  the Company is eligible to receive further milestones and royalty payments based on certain regulatory and commercial successes.On 25 April 2024  the Company published its annual report and accounts for the year ending 31 December 2023 (2023 Annual Report). The Annual Report included an update on subsequent events following the financial year end up to 25 April 2024. The Company's performance and outlook has continued in line with expectations since the publication of the 2023 Annual Report.As stated in the 2023 Annual Report  the Company determines its capital allocation with a measured approach that balances support for its current internal and founded entity programs and the funding of future innovation  with the goal of maximising Shareholder returns. The Board will assess ongoing opportunities to improve Shareholder returns  including additional capital returns to Shareholders from future monetisation events  while maintaining a cash runway of at least three years to support its internal programs  founded entities  future innovation and operational needs. The Board has determined that the Tender Offer would be the most suitable way of returning a proportion of the proceeds of the Transaction to Shareholders in a quick and efficient manner  taking account of the relative costs  complexity and timeframes of the possible methods available.Subject to the passing of the Resolution by Shareholders at the General Meeting  the Directors will give Shareholders the opportunity to tender Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs) through the Tender Offer for cash only. The Resolution will give the Directors authority to acquire up to 33 500 000 Ordinary Shares at a fixed tender price of 250 pence per Ordinary Share (the Tender Price).Tenders will only be accepted at the Tender Price. Subject to satisfaction of the Tender Conditions to the Tender Offer  Ordinary Shares which are successfully tendered under the Tender Offer will be purchased at the Tender Price.If the full amount of the $100 million is not returned through the Tender Offer  and if there is sufficient surplus  the Board intends to return such surplus by way of the Special Dividend.The Issued Ordinary Share Capital on the Latest Practicable Date was 270 761 077 Ordinary Shares (excluding 18 707 082 Ordinary Shares held in treasury). If the Tender Offer is implemented in full  this will result in the purchase and cancellation of up to 33 500 000 Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs) (representing approximately 12 percent of the Issued Ordinary Share Capital of the Company on the Latest Practicable Date). Shareholders should note that the Issued Ordinary Share Capital numbers referred to in this paragraph take no account of any dilution which may be caused by the Share Plans  which is explained in further detail in the Circular.2.2 Benefits of the Tender OfferThe Board considered various options for returning cash to Shareholders and determined that the Tender Offer  together with any subsequent Special Dividend (if any)  would be the most appropriate means of returning cash to Shareholders. In particular:the Tender Offer provides those Shareholders who wish to sell Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs) with the opportunity to do so at a market-driven price with a premium as at the Latest Practicable Date;the Tender Offer enables those Shareholders who do not wish to receive capital at this time to maintain their full investment in the Company;the Tender Price represents a premium of 25 percent to PureTech's trailing volume weighted average price per Ordinary Share over the three days prior to 19 March 2024  the date of PureTech's initial announcement of the Tender Offer proposals and a premium of 12.6 percent to the closing price of 222 pence per Ordinary Share on the Latest Practicable Date;the Tender Offer is available to all Shareholders regardless of the size of their shareholdings; andthe Tender Offer allows the Company to broaden the scope of the return of capital to include Ordinary Shares held by those Shareholders whose Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs) might not be purchased by the Company through a share purchase programme.2.3 Principal Terms of the Tender OfferJefferies will implement the Tender Offer by acquiring  as principal  the successfully tendered Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs) at the Tender Price. Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs) purchased by Jefferies pursuant to the Tender Offer will be purchased as principal and such purchases will be market purchases in accordance with the provisions of the Act  the Prospectus Regulation Rules  the Listing Rules  the rules of the London Stock Exchange  the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules and the Takeover Code. Immediately following completion of the Tender Offer  Jefferies shall exercise its right to sell such Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs) to the Company  at the Tender Price  pursuant to the Option Agreement. If Jefferies does not exercise its right to require the Company to purchase such Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs)  the Company has the right to require Jefferies to sell such Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs) to it at the Tender Price. Purchases of Ordinary Shares by the Company pursuant to the Option Agreement will also be market purchases in accordance with the provisions of the Act  the Prospectus Regulation Rules  the Listing Rules  the rules of the London Stock Exchange  the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules and the Takeover Code.All of the Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs) purchased by the Company pursuant to the Option Agreement in connection with the Tender Offer will be cancelled. Further details on the Option Agreement are set out in Part VIII of the Circular.Shareholders can decide whether they want to tender all  some or none of their Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs) in the Tender Offer.As at the date of this announcement  it is proposed that a maximum of 33 500 000 Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs) be purchased under the Tender Offer at the Tender Price  representing approximately 12 percent of the Company's Issued Ordinary Share Capital as at 16 May 2024  being the Latest Practicable Date  for a maximum aggregate amount of $100 million. The maximum amount of $100 million will be translated into a pounds sterling amount on the Ordinary Share Closing Date  which pounds sterling amount shall determine the maximum number of shares to be accepted for payment in the Tender Offer.Tenders in respect of Ordinary Shares may only be made at the Tender Price and tenders of ADSs may only be made at the ADS Tender Price.Each ADS represents 10 Ordinary Shares. Accordingly  the amount an ADS Holder will receive for each ADS in respect of which the underlying Ordinary Shares are successfully tendered under the Tender Offer will be an amount of £25.00 (twenty five pounds sterling)  being ten times the Tender Price  with such amounts to be converted by the Tender Agent from pounds sterling into US dollars and paid to the ADS Holder in US dollars (the ADS Tender Price). For illustrative purposes  the ADS Tender Price is equivalent to $31.68 per ADS (each of which represents 10 Ordinary Shares)  based on an exchange rate of pounds sterling to US dollars of £1.00 to $1.2671 (being the exchange rate on the Latest Practicable Date). The actual amount of US dollars such ADS Holder receives will depend upon the exchange rate prevailing at the time the Tender Agent converts the pounds sterling amount into US dollars.ADS Holders should be aware that the US dollar/pound sterling exchange rate that is prevailing on the date on which ADSs are tendered may be different than the US dollar/pound sterling exchange rate prevailing at the time the pounds sterling are converted into US dollars.Successfully tendered Ordinary Shares that are accepted for payment will be cancelled.Shareholders do not have to tender any Ordinary Shares if they do not wish to do so  and ADS Holders do not have to tender any ADSs if they do not wish to do so.ADS Holders should refer to Part VIII of the Circular.The Tender Offer will close at 1:00 p.m. (London time) on Thursday 20 June 2024 (and for ADS Holders at 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on Tuesday 18 June 2024) and tenders received after those times (as appropriate) will not be accepted (unless the Tender Offer is extended).Shareholders should note that  once tendered  Ordinary Shares may not be sold  transferred  charged  or otherwise disposed of other than in accordance with the Tender Offer.Shareholders who are in any doubt as to the contents of this announcement or as to the action to be taken should immediately consult their stockbroker  bank manager  solicitor  accountant  or other independent financial advisor authorised under FSMA  if taking advice in the UK or  if resident in another jurisdiction  from another appropriately authorised independent financial or professional advisor.2.4 Number of Ordinary Shares to be purchasedIf the aggregate value at the Tender Price of all validly tendered Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs) exceeds $100 million (based on the applicable exchange rate of US dollars to pounds sterling on the Ordinary Share Closing Date)  or the number of validly tendered Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs) exceeds 33 500 000 Ordinary Shares  acceptances of validly tendered Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs) will be scaled-down pro-rata to the total number of Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs) so tendered by that Shareholder  as described in paragraphs 2.14 and 2.15 of Part V of the Circular. Accordingly  where scaling-down applies  there is no guarantee that all of the Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs) which are tendered will be accepted for purchase.Successfully tendered Ordinary Shares will be purchased free of commission and dealing charges.Any Ordinary Shares repurchased by the Company from Jefferies following the purchase by Jefferies will be cancelled. Any rights of Shareholders who choose not to tender their Ordinary Shares or ADSs will be unaffected.Subject to any applicable law and regulatory requirements (including the rules and regulations of the London Stock Exchange and SEC)  the Company reserves the right at any time prior to the expiration of the Tender Offer  and with the prior consent of Jefferies  to extend the period during which the Tender Offer is open  based on market conditions and/or other factors.2.5 Circumstances in which the Tender Offer may not proceedThere is no guarantee that the Tender Offer will take place.

Accordingly  the Company is subject to US federal income tax as if it were a US corporation  and distributions made by the Company (including certain payments in respect of the Tender Offer that are treated as distributions for US federal income tax purposes) are generally treated as US-source dividends. As a result  both US Holders and Non-US Holders may be subject to US federal income tax withholding on receipt of cash proceeds from any tendered Ordinary Shares or ADSs accepted in the Tender Offer and the Special Dividend (if any).The attention of Shareholders is drawn to Part VI of the Circular  which provides a summary of certain material UK tax and US federal income tax consequences for Shareholders of accepting the Tender Offer or receipt of the Special Dividend (if any).

Whether or not Shareholders decide to tender all  or any  of their Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs) will depend on  among other things  their view of the Company's prospects and their own individual circumstances  including their own financial and tax position. Shareholders are required to take their own decision and are recommended to consult with their duly authorised independent financial or professional advisor.Appendix IExpected TimetableAnnouncement of launch of the Tender Offer  publication of the Circular and the Notice of General Meeting 20 May 2024 File Schedule TO with the SEC 20 May 2024 Tender Offer opens 20 May 2024 Latest time and date for receipt by the Depositary of voting instructions in respect of ADSs for the General Meeting 10:00 a.m. New York City time on 31 May 2024 Latest time and date for receipt of Forms of Proxy for the General Meeting 11:00 a.m. New York City time (4:00 p.m. London time) on 4 June 2024 General Meeting 11:00 a.m. New York City time (4:00 p.m. London time) on 6 June 2024 Announcement of results of the General Meeting 6 June 2024 Latest time and date for receipt by Tender Agent of Letters of Transmittal for ADSs and book-entry transfer of ADSs 5:00 p.m. New York City time on 18 June 2024 Latest time and date for receipt of Tender Forms and share certificates in relation to the Tender Offer 1:00 p.m. London time on 20 June 2024 Latest time and date for receipt of TTE Instructions in relation to the Tender Offer 1:00 p.m. London time on 20 June 2024 Announcement of results of the Tender Offer 24 June 2024 Purchase of Ordinary Shares under the Tender Offer 24 June 2024 CREST accounts credited with Tender Offer proceeds in respect of uncertificated Ordinary Shares by 25 June 2024 CREST accounts credited for revised  uncertificated holdings of Ordinary Shares (or  in the case of unsuccessful tenders  for entire holdings of Ordinary Shares) by 25 June 2024 Cheques despatched in respect of Tender Offer proceeds for Certificated Ordinary Shares by 3 July 2024 Credit of proceeds in respect of book-entry ADSs by 3 July 2024 Despatch of balance of ADSs by 3 July 2024 Cheques despatched in respect of Tender Offer proceeds for Certificated ADSs by 3 July 2024 Return of share certificates in respect of unsuccessful tenders of Certificated Ordinary Shares by 3 July 2024 Despatch of balancing share certificates (in respect of Certificated Ordinary Shares) for revised  certificated holdings in the case of partially successful tenders by 3 July 2024Notes:The dates and times set forth above are in accordance with English law and practice and are subject to the Company's right or  upon certain conditions set forth in the US securities laws  the Company's obligation to extend or amend the Tender Offer.References to times in this timetable are to London time (British Summer Time (BST)) or New York City time (Eastern Daylight Time (EDT)) (as stated).DefinitionsThe following definitions apply throughout this announcement  unless stated otherwise:Act the Companies Act 2006 of England and Wales  as amended from time to time ADR American Depositary Receipt representing ADSs ADS American Depositary Share  each representing 10 Ordinary Shares ADS Closing Date 5:00 p.m. New York City time on Tuesday 18 June 2024  unless the Tender Offer is extended ADS Holders the holder(s) of ADSs from time to time ADS Tender Price an amount of £25.00 (twenty five pounds sterling)  being ten times the Tender Price  with such amounts to be converted by the Tender Agent from pounds sterling into US dollars and paid to the ADS Holder in US dollars BMS Bristol Myers Squibb  Inc.

The maximum amount of $100 million will be translated into a pounds sterling amount on the Ordinary Share Closing Date  and that pounds sterling amount shall determine the maximum number of shares to be accepted for payment in the Tender Offer.The Tender Price represents a premium of 25 percent to PureTech’s trailing volume weighted average price per Ordinary Share over the three days prior to 19 March 2024  the date of the Company’s initial announcement of the Tender Offer proposals and a premium of 12.6 percent to the closing price of 222 pence per Ordinary Share on the Latest Practicable Date.If the full $100 million is not returned through the Tender Offer  then  if there is sufficient surplus  the Company’s board of directors (“Board”) intends to return such surplus by way of a special dividend following completion of the Tender Offer  without interest  less any applicable withholding taxes and subject to market and industry conditions at the time and any relevant legal restrictions (the “Special Dividend”).Completion of the Tender Offer will be conditional  among other things  on shareholder approval at a general meeting of the Company to be held at 11:00 a.m. New York City time (4:00 p.m. London time) on 6 June 2024 at the Company’s offices at 6 Tide Street  Boston  Massachusetts  02210  United States (the “General Meeting”).Full details of the Tender Offer are included in a circular to the Company’s Shareholders (the “Circular”) which will be mailed to Shareholders and ADS Holders today and available on a website set up by the Company for the purposes of the Tender Offer. The website is available at https://investors.puretechhealth.com/tender-offer . Copies of the Circular will be submitted to the National Storage Mechanism and will be available for inspection at https://data.fca.org.uk/#/nsm/nationalstoragemechanism . The Circular will also be included as an exhibit to the Schedule TO to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and will be available for inspection at https://www.sec.gov .. Copies of the Circular will be submitted to the National Storage Mechanism and will be available for inspection at . The Circular will also be included as an exhibit to the Schedule TO to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and will be available for inspection at . SHAREHOLDERS AND ADS HOLDERS ARE ADVISED TO CONSULT WITH THEIR PROFESSIONAL TAX ADVISORS IN CONNECTION WITH CERTAIN US FEDERAL WITHHOLDING TAX CONSIDERATIONS DESCRIBED IN FURTHER DETAIL BELOW (SEE “Certain US Federal Income Tax Considerations with Respect to the Tender Offer”).Structure of the Tender OfferThe Tender Offer will be implemented on the basis of Jefferies International Limited (“Jefferies”) acquiring  as principal  the successfully tendered Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs) at the Tender Price. In turn  Jefferies has the right to require the Company to purchase such Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs) from it at the same Tender Price pursuant to an option agreement entered into between the Company and Jefferies (the “Option Agreement”). If Jefferies does not exercise its right to require the Company to purchase such Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs)  the Company has the right to require Jefferies to sell such Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs) to it at the same price. The Company intends to cancel the Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs) purchased by it pursuant to the Tender Offer.Shareholders can decide whether they want to tender all  some or none of their Ordinary Shares or ADSs in the Tender Offer.If the aggregate value at the Tender Price of all validly tendered Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs) exceeds $100 million (based on the applicable exchange rate of US dollars to pounds sterling on the Ordinary Share Closing Date) or the number of validly tendered Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs) exceeds 33 500 000 Ordinary Shares  then not all of the Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs) validly tendered will be accepted and purchased. In these circumstances  tenders will be scaled down pro-rata to the total number of Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs) so tendered by that shareholder  such that the total cost of Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs) purchased pursuant to the Tender Offer does not exceed $100 million or the total number of validly tendered Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs) does not exceed 33 500 000 Ordinary Shares.Certain US Federal Income Tax Considerations with Respect to the Tender OfferShareholders and ADS Holders should consult their professional tax advisors in connection with the Tender Offer.Shareholders and ADS Holders should note that  due to the circumstances of its formation and the application of Section 7874 of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986  as amended (“Code”)  the Company is treated as a US domestic corporation for US federal income tax purposes. Accordingly  the Company is subject to US federal income tax as if it were a US corporation  and distributions made by the Company (including certain payments in respect of the Tender Offer that are treated as distributions for US federal income tax purposes) are generally treated as US-source dividends  as if the Company were incorporated in the US. As a result  both US Holders and Non-US Holders (each as defined in the Circular) may be subject to US federal income tax withholding on receipt of cash proceeds from any tendered Ordinary Shares or ADSs accepted in the Tender Offer and the Special Dividend (if any).The attention of Shareholders and ADS Holders is drawn to Part VI of the Circular  which provides a summary of certain material UK tax and US federal income tax consequences for Shareholders and ADS Holders of accepting the Tender Offer or receipt of the Special Dividend (if any).All Shareholders and ADS Holders should receive a Section 302 Certification. Copies of the Section 302 Certification  IRS Form W-9  and IRS Forms W-8  as well the IRS instructions with respect to such IRS Forms  are also available on the Microsite set up by the Company for the purposes of the Tender Offer.

IRS Form W-9 and IRS Form W-8 will also be relevant in connection with the Special Dividend (if any).This information is not tax advice  and the Company cannot advise you with respect to taxes.

The capital return of $100 million represents approximately 14 percent of the Company’s market capitalisation based on the Company’s closing share price as at 18 March 2024  being the date prior to the announcement of the proposed Tender Offer.The Company’s $50 million share buyback program completed on 7 February 2024  which  together with the proposed Tender Offer  would constitute $150 million of capital returned to Shareholders  representing approximately 20 percent of the Company’s market capitalisation as at 16 May 2024  being the Latest Practicable Date before publication of the Circular.The fixed Tender Price of 250 pence per Ordinary Share (equivalent to £25.00 per ADS) represents:a premium of 25 percent to PureTech’s trailing volume weighted average price per Ordinary Share over the three days prior to 19 March 2024  the date of PureTech’s initial announcement of the Tender Offer proposals; anda premium of 12.6 percent to the closing price of 222 pence per Ordinary Share on the Latest Practicable Date.Shareholders are not required to tender any or all of their Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs) if they do not wish to do so. There is no guarantee that the Tender Offer will return the full sum of $100 million to Shareholders. If the full $100 million is not returned through the Tender Offer  then  if there is sufficient surplus  the Board intends to return such surplus by way of a special dividend following completion of the Tender Offer  without interest  less any applicable withholding taxes and subject to market and industry conditions at the time and any relevant legal restrictions (the “Special Dividend”).Shareholder approval for the maximum number of Ordinary Shares which may be acquired and the fixed price at which Ordinary Shares may be acquired at a General Meeting to be held at 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) (4:00 p.m. (London time)) on 6 June 2024. The Notice of General Meeting is set out in the Circular.The Circular contains details of the procedure that should be followed by those Shareholders and ADS Holders wishing to participate in the Tender Offer.Shareholders and ADS Holders should note that any amounts paid to Shareholders or ADS Holders in respect of the Tender Offer and the Special Dividend (if any) may be subject to US withholding tax unless the appropriate certifying forms can be provided by such Shareholder or ADS Holder to establish an exemption from  or a reduction of  such US withholding tax.Shareholders and ADS Holders should refer to Part VI of the Circular for further information on the important tax considerations in respect of the Tender Offer and Special Dividend (if any)  together with instructions on the arrangements to provide appropriate certifying forms.2. TENDER OFFER2.1 Background to and reasons for the Tender OfferOn 18 March 2024  the Company announced the completion of the sale of its stocks in Karuna to Bristol Myers Squibb  Inc. (“BMS”) for a total equity value of approximately $14 billion (the “Transaction”). The Company received approximately $293 million gross proceeds from the sale of its Karuna equity position. In addition  the Company is eligible to receive further milestones and royalty payments based on certain regulatory and commercial successes.On 25 April 2024  the Company published its annual report and accounts for the year ending 31 December 2023 (“2023 Annual Report”). The Annual Report included an update on subsequent events following the financial year end up to 25 April 2024. The Company’s performance and outlook has continued in line with expectations since the publication of the 2023 Annual Report.As stated in the 2023 Annual Report  the Company determines its capital allocation with a measured approach that balances support for its current internal and founded entity programs and the funding of future innovation  with the goal of maximising Shareholder returns. The Board will assess ongoing opportunities to improve Shareholder returns  including additional capital returns to Shareholders from future monetisation events  while maintaining a cash runway of at least three years to support its internal programs  founded entities  future innovation and operational needs. The Board has determined that the Tender Offer would be the most suitable way of returning a proportion of the proceeds of the Transaction to Shareholders in a quick and efficient manner  taking account of the relative costs  complexity and timeframes of the possible methods available.Subject to the passing of the Resolution by Shareholders at the General Meeting  the Directors will give Shareholders the opportunity to tender Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs) through the Tender Offer for cash only. The Resolution will give the Directors authority to acquire up to 33 500 000 Ordinary Shares at a fixed tender price of 250 pence per Ordinary Share (the “Tender Price”).Tenders will only be accepted at the Tender Price. Subject to satisfaction of the Tender Conditions to the Tender Offer  Ordinary Shares which are successfully tendered under the Tender Offer will be purchased at the Tender Price.If the full amount of the $100 million is not returned through the Tender Offer  and if there is sufficient surplus  the Board intends to return such surplus by way of the Special Dividend.The Issued Ordinary Share Capital on the Latest Practicable Date was 270 761 077 Ordinary Shares (excluding 18 707 082 Ordinary Shares held in treasury). If the Tender Offer is implemented in full  this will result in the purchase and cancellation of up to 33 500 000 Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs) (representing approximately 12 percent of the Issued Ordinary Share Capital of the Company on the Latest Practicable Date). Shareholders should note that the Issued Ordinary Share Capital numbers referred to in this paragraph take no account of any dilution which may be caused by the Share Plans  which is explained in further detail in the Circular.2.2 Benefits of the Tender OfferThe Board considered various options for returning cash to Shareholders and determined that the Tender Offer  together with any subsequent Special Dividend (if any)  would be the most appropriate means of returning cash to Shareholders. In particular:the Tender Offer provides those Shareholders who wish to sell Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs) with the opportunity to do so at a market-driven price with a premium as at the Latest Practicable Date;the Tender Offer enables those Shareholders who do not wish to receive capital at this time to maintain their full investment in the Company;the Tender Price represents a premium of 25 percent to PureTech’s trailing volume weighted average price per Ordinary Share over the three days prior to 19 March 2024  the date of PureTech’s initial announcement of the Tender Offer proposals and a premium of 12.6 percent to the closing price of 222 pence per Ordinary Share on the Latest Practicable Date;the Tender Offer is available to all Shareholders regardless of the size of their shareholdings; andthe Tender Offer allows the Company to broaden the scope of the return of capital to include Ordinary Shares held by those Shareholders whose Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs) might not be purchased by the Company through a share purchase programme.2.3 Principal Terms of the Tender OfferJefferies will implement the Tender Offer by acquiring  as principal  the successfully tendered Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs) at the Tender Price. Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs) purchased by Jefferies pursuant to the Tender Offer will be purchased as principal and such purchases will be market purchases in accordance with the provisions of the Act  the Prospectus Regulation Rules  the Listing Rules  the rules of the London Stock Exchange  the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules and the Takeover Code. Immediately following completion of the Tender Offer  Jefferies shall exercise its right to sell such Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs) to the Company  at the Tender Price  pursuant to the Option Agreement. If Jefferies does not exercise its right to require the Company to purchase such Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs)  the Company has the right to require Jefferies to sell such Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs) to it at the Tender Price. Purchases of Ordinary Shares by the Company pursuant to the Option Agreement will also be market purchases in accordance with the provisions of the Act  the Prospectus Regulation Rules  the Listing Rules  the rules of the London Stock Exchange  the Disclosure Guidance and Transparency Rules and the Takeover Code.All of the Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs) purchased by the Company pursuant to the Option Agreement in connection with the Tender Offer will be cancelled. Further details on the Option Agreement are set out in Part VIII of the Circular.Shareholders can decide whether they want to tender all  some or none of their Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs) in the Tender Offer.As at the date of this announcement  it is proposed that a maximum of 33 500 000 Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs) be purchased under the Tender Offer at the Tender Price  representing approximately 12 percent of the Company’s Issued Ordinary Share Capital as at 16 May 2024  being the Latest Practicable Date  for a maximum aggregate amount of $100 million. The maximum amount of $100 million will be translated into a pounds sterling amount on the Ordinary Share Closing Date  which pounds sterling amount shall determine the maximum number of shares to be accepted for payment in the Tender Offer.Tenders in respect of Ordinary Shares may only be made at the Tender Price and tenders of ADSs may only be made at the ADS Tender Price.Each ADS represents 10 Ordinary Shares. Accordingly  the amount an ADS Holder will receive for each ADS in respect of which the underlying Ordinary Shares are successfully tendered under the Tender Offer will be an amount of £25.00 (twenty five pounds sterling)  being ten times the Tender Price  with such amounts to be converted by the Tender Agent from pounds sterling into US dollars and paid to the ADS Holder in US dollars (the “ADS Tender Price”). For illustrative purposes  the ADS Tender Price is equivalent to $31.68 per ADS (each of which represents 10 Ordinary Shares)  based on an exchange rate of pounds sterling to US dollars of £1.00 to $1.2671 (being the exchange rate on the Latest Practicable Date). The actual amount of US dollars such ADS Holder receives will depend upon the exchange rate prevailing at the time the Tender Agent converts the pounds sterling amount into US dollars.ADS Holders should be aware that the US dollar/pound sterling exchange rate that is prevailing on the date on which ADSs are tendered may be different than the US dollar/pound sterling exchange rate prevailing at the time the pounds sterling are converted into US dollars.Successfully tendered Ordinary Shares that are accepted for payment will be cancelled.Shareholders do not have to tender any Ordinary Shares if they do not wish to do so  and ADS Holders do not have to tender any ADSs if they do not wish to do so.ADS Holders should refer to Part VIII of the Circular.The Tender Offer will close at 1:00 p.m. (London time) on Thursday 20 June 2024 (and for ADS Holders at 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on Tuesday 18 June 2024) and tenders received after those times (as appropriate) will not be accepted (unless the Tender Offer is extended).Shareholders should note that  once tendered  Ordinary Shares may not be sold  transferred  charged  or otherwise disposed of other than in accordance with the Tender Offer.Shareholders who are in any doubt as to the contents of this announcement or as to the action to be taken should immediately consult their stockbroker  bank manager  solicitor  accountant  or other independent financial advisor authorised under FSMA  if taking advice in the UK or  if resident in another jurisdiction  from another appropriately authorised independent financial or professional advisor.2.4 Number of Ordinary Shares to be purchasedIf the aggregate value at the Tender Price of all validly tendered Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs) exceeds $100 million (based on the applicable exchange rate of US dollars to pounds sterling on the Ordinary Share Closing Date)  or the number of validly tendered Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs) exceeds 33 500 000 Ordinary Shares  acceptances of validly tendered Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs) will be scaled-down pro-rata to the total number of Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs) so tendered by that Shareholder  as described in paragraphs 2.14 and 2.15 of Part V of the Circular. Accordingly  where scaling-down applies  there is no guarantee that all of the Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs) which are tendered will be accepted for purchase.Successfully tendered Ordinary Shares will be purchased free of commission and dealing charges.Any Ordinary Shares repurchased by the Company from Jefferies following the purchase by Jefferies will be cancelled. Any rights of Shareholders who choose not to tender their Ordinary Shares or ADSs will be unaffected.Subject to any applicable law and regulatory requirements (including the rules and regulations of the London Stock Exchange and SEC)  the Company reserves the right at any time prior to the expiration of the Tender Offer  and with the prior consent of Jefferies  to extend the period during which the Tender Offer is open  based on market conditions and/or other factors.2.5 Circumstances in which the Tender Offer may not proceedThere is no guarantee that the Tender Offer will take place. The Tender Offer is conditional on  among other things:the passing of the Resolution at the General Meeting; receipt of valid tenders in respect of at least 2 707 611 Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs) (representing approximately one percent of the Issued Ordinary Share Capital of the Company as at the Latest Practicable Date) by 1:00 p.m. on the Ordinary Share Closing Date (unless the Tender Offer is extended); Jefferies being satisfied  acting reasonably  that  at all times up to immediately prior to the announcement of the results of the Tender Offer  the Company has complied with its obligations  and is not in breach of any of the representations and warranties given by it  under the Option Agreement; the Company continuing to have sufficient profits available for distribution to acquire  under the Option Agreement  the Ordinary Shares purchased by Jefferies pursuant to the Tender Offer; there not arising any material adverse change or certain other force majeure events prior to the closing of the Tender Offer; and certain other Tender Conditions as set out in paragraph 2.1 of Part V of the Circular.The Company has reserved the right at any time prior to the expiration of the Tender Offer  with the prior consent of Jefferies  to extend the period during which the Tender Offer is open and/or vary the aggregate value of the Tender Offer  based on market conditions and/or other factors  subject to compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Any such decision will be announced by the Company through a Regulatory Information Service and by a press release in the US.The Company may terminate the Tender Offer if the Company concludes  in its reasonable discretion  one or more of the Tender Conditions set out in paragraph 2.1 of Part V of this Tender Offer have not been satisfied.2.6 Results announcementAs set out in the expected timetable below  it is expected that the results of the Tender Offer will be announced on 24 June 2024  subject to the satisfaction of the Tender Conditions. Settlement is then expected to take place as set out in the timetable.2.7 Full terms and conditions of the Tender OfferFull details of the Tender Offer  including the terms and conditions on which it is made  are set out in Part V of the Circular. Some questions and answers related to the Tender Offer are set out in Part IV of the Circular.Further details of the Tender Offer in respect of the ADSs  including some questions and answers relating to the tender of the Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs and certain terms and conditions on which the Tender Offer is made in respect of the ADSs  are set out in Part VIII of the Circular.3. GENERAL MEETING TO APPROVE THE RESOLUTIONThe Tender Offer requires the approval by Shareholders of the Resolution at the General Meeting. For this purpose  the Company is convening the General Meeting for 11:00 a.m. (New York City time) (4:00 p.m. (London time)) on 6 June 2024 to be held at 6 Tide Street  Boston  Massachusetts  02210  United States to consider and  if thought fit  pass the Resolution to authorise and to approve the terms on which the Tender Offer will be effected. A notice convening the General Meeting is set out at the end of the Circular.The General Meeting has been convened to consider and  if thought fit  approve a resolution authorising the Company to purchase up to a maximum of 33 500 000 Ordinary Shares  representing approximately 12 percent of the Issued Ordinary Share Capital as at the Latest Practicable Date.The Company will not purchase Ordinary Shares pursuant to the Tender Offer unless the Resolution is duly passed.A summary of action to be taken by Shareholders in connection with the General Meeting is set out in paragraph 9 of Part III of the Circular  together with the notes to the Notice of General Meeting as set out in Part X of the Circular.4. TAXShareholders and ADS Holders should note that  due to the circumstances of its formation and the application of Section 7874 of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986  as amended (“Code”)  the Company is treated as a US domestic corporation for US federal income tax purposes. Accordingly  the Company is subject to US federal income tax as if it were a US corporation  and distributions made by the Company (including certain payments in respect of the Tender Offer that are treated as distributions for US federal income tax purposes) are generally treated as US-source dividends. As a result  both US Holders and Non-US Holders may be subject to US federal income tax withholding on receipt of cash proceeds from any tendered Ordinary Shares or ADSs accepted in the Tender Offer and the Special Dividend (if any).The attention of Shareholders is drawn to Part VI of the Circular  which provides a summary of certain material UK tax and US federal income tax consequences for Shareholders of accepting the Tender Offer or receipt of the Special Dividend (if any). Part VI also provides additional information to Shareholders on Section 302 Certifications  IRS Form W-9 and IRS Form W-8.This information is not tax advice. Shareholders and ADS Holders should consult their professional tax advisors  in particular regarding their individual tax position and the exemptions or reductions of US withholding tax that may be available to them.5. OVERSEAS SHAREHOLDERSThe attention of Shareholders who are not resident in  or nationals or citizens of  the United Kingdom is drawn to paragraph 5 of Part V of the Circular.6. BOARD INTENTIONSThe Company’s Chief Executive Officer  Dr Bharatt Chowrira  has confirmed that he does not intend to tender any of his current individual beneficial holding of Ordinary Shares through the Tender Offer. The remainder of the Board  comprising the Company’s interim chair and the Company’s non-executive directors  are each considering their individual position and may tender Ordinary Shares of which they are the registered or beneficial holder  or otherwise hold on trust as trustees (as applicable)  under the Tender Offer.7. RECOMMENDATION BY THE BOARDThe Directors consider that the Tender Offer is in the best interests of the Shareholders as a whole. Accordingly  the Board recommends that Shareholders vote in favour of the Resolution  as the Directors intend to do for their respective individual beneficial holdings of  in aggregate  7 938 094 Ordinary Shares  representing approximately 3 per cent. of the Issued Ordinary Share Capital of the Company as at the Latest Practicable Date.The Board makes no recommendation to Shareholders in relation to participation in the Tender Offer itself. Whether or not Shareholders decide to tender all  or any  of their Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares represented by ADSs) will depend on  among other things  their view of the Company’s prospects and their own individual circumstances  including their own financial and tax position. Shareholders are required to take their own decision and are recommended to consult with their duly authorised independent financial or professional advisor.Appendix IExpected TimetableAnnouncement of launch of the Tender Offer  publication of the Circular and the Notice of General Meeting 20 May 2024 File Schedule TO with the SEC 20 May 2024 Tender Offer opens 20 May 2024 Latest time and date for receipt by the Depositary of voting instructions in respect of ADSs for the General Meeting 10:00 a.m. New York City time on 31 May 2024 Latest time and date for receipt of Forms of Proxy for the General Meeting 11:00 a.m. New York City time (4:00 p.m. London time) on 4 June 2024 General Meeting 11:00 a.m. New York City time (4:00 p.m. London time) on 6 June 2024 Announcement of results of the General Meeting 6 June 2024 Latest time and date for receipt by Tender Agent of Letters of Transmittal for ADSs and book-entry transfer of ADSs 5:00 p.m. New York City time on 18 June 2024 Latest time and date for receipt of Tender Forms and share certificates in relation to the Tender Offer 1:00 p.m. London time on 20 June 2024 Latest time and date for receipt of TTE Instructions in relation to the Tender Offer 1:00 p.m. London time on 20 June 2024 Announcement of results of the Tender Offer 24 June 2024 Purchase of Ordinary Shares under the Tender Offer 24 June 2024 CREST accounts credited with Tender Offer proceeds in respect of uncertificated Ordinary Shares by 25 June 2024 CREST accounts credited for revised  uncertificated holdings of Ordinary Shares (or  in the case of unsuccessful tenders  for entire holdings of Ordinary Shares) by 25 June 2024 Cheques despatched in respect of Tender Offer proceeds for Certificated Ordinary Shares by 3 July 2024 Credit of proceeds in respect of book-entry ADSs by 3 July 2024 Despatch of balance of ADSs by 3 July 2024 Cheques despatched in respect of Tender Offer proceeds for Certificated ADSs by 3 July 2024 Return of share certificates in respect of unsuccessful tenders of Certificated Ordinary Shares by 3 July 2024 Despatch of balancing share certificates (in respect of Certificated Ordinary Shares) for revised  certificated holdings in the case of partially successful tenders by 3 July 2024Notes:The dates and times set forth above are in accordance with English law and practice and are subject to the Company’s right or  upon certain conditions set forth in the US securities laws  the Company’s obligation to extend or amend the Tender Offer.References to times in this timetable are to London time (British Summer Time (BST)) or New York City time (Eastern Daylight Time (EDT)) (as stated).DefinitionsThe following definitions apply throughout this announcement  unless stated otherwise:Act the Companies Act 2006 of England and Wales  as amended from time to time ADR American Depositary Receipt representing ADSs ADS American Depositary Share  each representing 10 Ordinary Shares ADS Closing Date 5:00 p.m. New York City time on Tuesday 18 June 2024  unless the Tender Offer is extended ADS Holders the holder(s) of ADSs from time to time ADS Tender Price an amount of £25.00 (twenty five pounds sterling)  being ten times the Tender Price  with such amounts to be converted by the Tender Agent from pounds sterling into US dollars and paid to the ADS Holder in US dollars BMS Bristol Myers Squibb  Inc.

41233,Euroclear,Bing API,https://www.devdiscourse.com/article/law-order/2945888-eu-leverages-frozen-russian-assets-for-ukraine-defense-aid,EU Leverages Frozen Russian Assets for Ukraine Defense Aid,The European Union has adopted a plan to use windfall profits from frozen Russian central bank assets for Ukraine's defense  marking a complex and controversial precedent. The move aims to channel billions in profits to Ukraine through various methods ,"European Union countries formally adopted a plan on Tuesday to use windfall profits from Russian central bank assets frozen in the EU for Ukraine's defence. It is the first in what could be a series of moves by the G7 group of large Western nations to utilise the near $300 billion worth of Moscow's assets that have been immobilised  but it remains a highly complex and controversial precedent.Here is what has been done and some of the other ideas being looked at: SIPHONING OFF PROCEEDS Tuesday's EU move exploits the fact that the lion's share of the Russian reserves - essentially bonds and other types of securities in which the Russian central bank had invested - are held in a Brussels-based depository called Euroclear.Under the agreement  90% of the proceeds that the bonds generate will go into an EU-run fund for military aid for Ukraine  with the other 10% going to support Kyiv in other ways. The EU expects the assets to yield about 15-20 billion euros ($16-$22 billion) in profits by 2027. Ukraine is expected to receive the first tranche of around 3.5 billion euros in July. This will be on top of a 50 billion euro support programme that the EU set up on Feb. 1. Some are still wary  though  including the European Central Bank  which has said that any seizure of the Russian assets should only be done in concert with other G7 powers. They want to ensure it is not only the euro that is affected if other countries such as China start repatriating their reserves as a precaution against their being frozen. Some lawyers also say that  legally  there is little difference between siphoning off the bonds' revenues and seizing the full $300 billion or so. There is a risk that Russia could  through court action  try to seize Euroclear cash in securities depositories in Hong Kong  Dubai and elsewhere. This could potentially drain Euroclear's capital and require a huge bailout. There are plans  therefore  to set aside some of the siphoned-off money as a safety net. COLLATERALISED LOAN U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen will next week push fellow G7 finance officials - from Japan  Germany  France  Britain  Italy and Canada - to get the interest earnings on the frozen Russian assets to Ukraine far more quickly. The U.S. wants to pull forward the interest on the assets to back a bond or a loan that would provide Ukraine with perhaps $50 billion as it battles increasing Russian military pressure in its east and north. 'Collateralising' the Russian assets for loans instead of seizing them outright could be more palatable to some European countries and others elsewhere in the world. Daleep Singh  the U.S. deputy national security adviser who is one of the architects of the plan  has said it is conceptually possible to transfer 10 or even 30 years of future profits.Sources briefed on the plans say the goal is to reach a decision at the G7 leaders' annual summit in Italy in June. FULL CONFISCATION Washington continues to back the idea of seizing the immobilised Russian reserves in their entirety and handing them to Ukraine  though it acknowledges that other countries would need to be on board  something that is not the case at the moment. Some top lawyers argue it can be done under a doctrine of international law known as ""countermeasures"". The assets would then be sold or collateralised and the proceeds handed to Ukraine  or to its dedicated reconstruction fund. European officials raise concerns  however  that it could violate international law and open a Pandora's box as Russia challenges the move in the courts. Previous examples of such seizures  such as of Iraqi assets after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait  and of German assets after World War Two  happened after those wars had ended  not while they were still raging - as with Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Even in the United States  leading sovereign debt experts have highlighted that the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) does not authorise an outright confiscation of frozen Russian property in the absence of actual armed conflict between the U.S. and Russia. The IMF is wary too. Its managing director  Kristalina Georgieva  urged G7 nations on May 21 to think ""very carefully"" about how they use the Russian assets.REPARATION BONDS ""Reparation bonds"" have also been suggested as a way of circumventing some of the legal problems. Ukraine would sell securities that pay out if - and only if - it receives reparations for the devastation inflicted by the war. Interest payments could also roll up and only become payable if Kyiv gets compensation. The bondholders would not have a contractual claim on the Kremlin's frozen reserves. But given that Russia is unlikely to pay up willingly  these assets would be the most likely source of reparation money.Since the reserves are accruing interest  they could be used to pay both the bonds' principal and more regular coupon payments. This would be different from confiscation  because the assets would only be transferred if a legitimate compensation mechanism first ruled that damages were due to Ukraine. Ukraine would have a way to collect on any damages awarded up to the value of the reserves. It could therefore issue reparation bonds up to $300-350 billion. But it would only get anything like this sum if the United States  EU governments and other allies were willing to buy the securities.SYNDICATED LOAN The bond idea has been fleshed out further by Singh  Lee Buchheit  a veteran legal expert in sovereign debt  and Reuters Commentator-at-Large Hugo Dixon. Their view is that Ukraine could pledge its claim against Russia to a syndicate of its allies in return for a loan. If Moscow refused to pay the damages  the allies could then use Russia's frozen assets to pay off the loan. The justification for doing this is the widely recognised legal principle that if a creditor controls a debtor's assets  it can set off those assets against an unpaid debt.(This story has not been edited by Devdiscourse staff and is auto-generated from a syndicated feed.)",neutral,0.05,0.87,0.08,negative,0.02,0.24,0.73,True,English,"['EU Leverages Frozen Russian Assets', 'Ukraine Defense Aid', 'COLLATERALISED LOAN U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen', 'U.S. deputy national security adviser', 'International Emergency Economic Powers Act', 'leading sovereign debt experts', ""G7 leaders' annual summit"", 'fellow G7 finance officials', '50 billion euro support programme', 'The U.S.', 'Russian central bank assets', 'European Central Bank', 'other G7 powers', 'near $300 billion worth', 'actual armed conflict', 'large Western nations', '15-20 billion euros', 'dedicated reconstruction fund', 'regular coupon payments', 'Russian military pressure', 'frozen Russian property', 'legitimate compensation mechanism', 'European Union countries', '3.5 billion euros', 'European officials', 'G7 nations', 'G7 group', 'international law', 'European countries', 'EU-run fund', 'military aid', 'The IMF', 'other countries', 'Russian assets', 'other ideas', 'other types', 'other ways', 'Russian reserves', 'frozen reserves', 'controversial precedent', 'Brussels-based depository', 'first tranche', 'little difference', 'court action', 'Hong Kong', 'huge bailout', 'off money', 'safety net', 'Daleep Singh', 'Previous examples', 'United States', 'managing director', 'Kristalina Georgieva', 'legal problems', 'Interest payments', 'contractual claim', 'likely source', 'reparation money', 'Iraqi assets', 'German assets', 'windfall profits', 'future profits', 'FULL CONFISCATION', 'outright confiscation', ""bonds' revenues"", 'Reparation bonds', ""bonds' principal"", 'Euroclear cash', 'interest earnings', 'securities depositories', 'top lawyers', 'World War', 'EU move', 'plan', 'Tuesday', 'Ukraine', 'defence', 'series', 'moves', 'Moscow', 'complex', 'SIPHONING', 'PROCEEDS', 'fact', 'share', 'agreement', 'Kyiv', 'July', 'Feb.', 'seizure', 'concert', 'China', 'precaution', 'risk', 'Dubai', 'capital', 'Japan', 'Germany', 'France', 'Britain', 'Italy', 'Canada', 'increasing', 'east', 'north', 'loans', 'others', 'architects', '30 years', 'Sources', 'goal', 'decision', 'June', 'Washington', 'entirety', 'board', 'something', 'case', 'moment', 'doctrine', 'countermeasures', 'concerns', 'Pandora', 'box', 'courts', '1990 invasion', 'Kuwait', 'wars', 'IEEPA', 'absence', 'May', 'reparations', 'devastation', 'bondholders', 'Kremlin', 'damages', '10']",2024-05-21,2024-05-21,devdiscourse.com

The vast majority of the funds has been held through the Belgium-based settlement giant Euroclear  where they have generated about €3.9 billion in net profit since last year.The US has been pushing a separate plan that would leverage the future revenue of the frozen assets to back a $50 billion loan to Ukraine. Should the G-7 reach an agreement on this accord  it would replace the EU initiative.Bloomberg reported earlier Tuesday that Germany is now ready to support the American plan.Under the EU’s plan  Ukraine would receive the net profits from Feb. 15 onwards.

The EU plan also includes a mechanism to allow the clearing house to retain more funds should those resources prove insufficient to manage any sudden and unexpected risks.The adoption of the proposal by EU affairs ministers in Brussels comes after months of haggling between member states amid worries about possible legal challenges  retaliation from Russia and risk to the stability of the euro.The assets are expected to generate about €5 billion a year  with Ukraine receiving the aid twice a year.--With assistance from Megan Howard.(Updates with details on a US plan in the fourth paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek©2024 Bloomberg L.P.,neutral,0.09,0.74,0.17,negative,0.04,0.19,0.77,True,English,"['Frozen Russian Assets', 'EU', 'Plan', 'Profits', 'Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky', 'first quarter financial results', 'European Union member states', 'social media platform', 'Belgium-based settlement giant', 'possible legal challenges', 'EU affairs ministers', '2024 Bloomberg L.P.', 'Russian sovereign assets', 'legal action', 'Russian assets', 'military defense', 'Seven nations', 'vast majority', 'net profit', 'last year', 'The US', 'future revenue', '$50 billion loan', 'clearing house', 'Megan Howard', 'fourth paragraph', 'EU initiative', 'separate plan', 'American plan', 'US plan', 'Bloomberg Businessweek', 'unexpected risks', 'EU plan', 'Feb. 15 date', 'profits', 'Tuesday', 'Ukraine', 'recovery', 'move', 'Group', '2022 invasion', 'two-thirds', 'funds', 'Euroclear', 'G-7', 'agreement', 'accord', 'Germany', 'mechanism', 'resources', 'sudden', 'adoption', 'proposal', 'Brussels', 'months', 'worries', 'retaliation', 'stability', 'aid', 'assistance', 'Updates', 'details']",2024-05-21,2024-05-21,ca.news.yahoo.com

This partnership introduces the use of wCBDC by the SNB for initial settlement.The coupon and redemption payments will be made using tokenized CHF on the SDX. The SDX connects to conventional settlement systems such as Euroclear and Clearstream  via SIX SIS  allowing investors to hold the digital bond through their traditional custodians. The transaction follows the World Bank’s recent digital issuance on Euroclear’s Digital Financial Market Infrastructure (D-FMI) and builds upon its partnerships with core market infrastructure providers to scale digitalization efforts.The bond is listed on both SIX Digital Exchange and the traditional SIX Swiss Exchange. The securities are governed by Swiss law. The bond was placed mainly in Switzerland  with banks  bank treasuries and corporates representing the majority share of allocations at 60%  followed by asset managers  insurance companies and pension funds at 39%. The remainder was placed with central banks and official institutions.“We are grateful for the opportunity to issue the first CHF digital bond as an international issuer. This achievement marks another significant step in the World Bank’s commitment to increasing capital markets’ efficiency through digitalization in partnership with central banks and central securities depositories. It builds on our previous accomplishments with bond-i and the issuance of digitally native notes last October ”said Jorge Familiar  Vice President and Treasurer of the World Bank.“Being able to settle wholesale transactions in tokenized central bank money is a critical  foundational requirement for the adoption of a blockchain based capital markets infrastructure.

41242,Clearstream,Bing API,https://www.tradersmagazine.com/xtra/canadian-market-increases-automation-ahead-of-t1/,Canadian Market Increases Automation Ahead of T+1,In addition to T+1  the Canadian market also faces the disappearance of Banker’s Acceptances following the cessation of the Canadian Dollar Offer Rate on 28 June this year  so participants need another funding mechanism.,The new Canadian Collateral Management Service (CCMS)  which enables domestic tri-party repo capabilities for the first time  has been launched ahead of the country shortening its settlement cycle this month.TMX Group  which operates Toronto Stock Exchange and post-trade infrastructure including the Canadian Depository for Securities developed CCMS with Clearstream  the international central securities depository of Germany’s Deutsche Börse. The new platform enables market participants to transact domestic tri-party repos for the first time  with the aim of increasing liquidity.Steve Everett  head of post trade innovation at TMX Group  told Markets Media that CCMS interoperates with the group’s settlement engine  which is critical in avoiding further fragmentation.Steve Everett  TMX“The way we have designed CCMS brings those two worlds together ” he added. “Through unlimited substitution we have the ability to bring assets back in time for settlement without manual intervention.”The end-to-end lifecycle of a repo trade is fully automated  which is important as Canada is cutting its settlement cycle from two days after a trade  T+2  to T+1 on 27 May this year  one day before US markets make that transition.Repos allow one firm to sell a security to another firm with a simultaneous promise to buy the security back at a later date at a specified price  which has the economic effect of a collateralized loan  as they are mainly used to borrow cash using securities as collateral. In a bilateral repo  each counterparty’s custodian bank is responsible for the clearing and settlement of the trade. In contrast  a triparty repo involves a clearing bank who supports both parties in the trade and settles the repo on its books.Everett said: “The ability to interoperate between custodians means we are able to substitute and settle straight out of the trade accounts and bring automation.”TechnologyThe ability to settle collateral from trade accounts means counterparties can keep their existing custody relationships  while being able to benefit from the benefits of CCMS. Everett continued that average collateral reuse processes can take up to nine hops  so recalling assets in time to meet T+1 settlement deadlines can be problematic  as it can take hours  if not days. CCMS automation reduces this top minutes.“CCMS necessitates behavioural change  because it is so fast  efficient and secure ” added Everett. “It is like a speedboat in a sea of tugboats.”Marton Szigeti  head of collateral  lending & liquidity solutions at Clearstream  told Markets Media that CCMS is a development of the firm’s triparty collateral management platform that has been running for more than 20 years.“Our platform is unique because we can do third party collateral management ” said Szigeti. “We use a data interface where we receive the mirrored account information.”Szigeti continued that the Clearstream platform had to be fine tuned for the Canadian market  which took about 12 months before it went live this month. Clearstream also worked with some Canadian clients on testing and connectivity for CCMS during the market readiness period.Marton Szigeti  ClearstreamCCMS has generated interest in other countries. Szigeti said there are some conversations in different parts of the world around how the model works  especially in an environment of accelerating settlement periods.“Higher collateral velocity is needed to survive in a T+1 environment ” he added.In addition  banks are increasingly facing balance sheet pressure and market participants want to use their collateral as efficiently as possible to lower their funding costs.Szigeti said: “Collateral efficiency is a general theme in the industry on a global basis.”Increasing participationThe big five Canadian banks – BMO  CIBC  RBC  Scotiabank and TD – have conducted inaugural trades on CCMS. In addition  more than 20 market participants are in the process of being onboard according to Everett.In addition to T+1  the Canadian market also faces the disappearance of Banker’s Acceptances following the cessation of the Canadian Dollar Offer Rate on 28 June this year  so participants need another funding mechanism.“We look forward to welcoming corporates in the triparty repo for the first time in Canada  as an alternative to money markets “ said Everett.”We are expanding and democratising type of counterparties in the repo market  as well as the type of assets that can be used.”Other users could include asset managers  insurance companies and pensions to diversify both cash and collateral providers.“The vision for CCMS is to facilitate a liquidity hub here in Canada by bringing together cash and collateral providers in one place and giving them a very simple way to transact very complex products ” Everett added.Everett expects CCMS to have really positive volumes by the fall of this year as more counterparties are added.Nicholas Chan  BMONicholas Chan  head  financial resource management  BMO Capital Markets and co-chair  Canadian Infrastructure and Market Practices Advisory Group (CIMPA)  said in a statement: “The development of a tri-party repo service represents an advancement in the evolution of liquidity management in Canada  leveraging technology to optimise efficiency  risk management and collateral eligibility in the Canadian market.”Only fixed income securities can currently be used as collateral in CCMS  but equities will be added shortly in the next update.“It is really interesting to add additional exposures ” he added. “We will eventually expand the service into securities lending.”CCMS first aims to mobilise domestic assets before addressing foreign exposures and assets. Clearstream is an international securities depository and some Canadian institutions also operate in Europe.Szigeti said it will take a number of years before clients can link collateral in Canada and international securities in Clearstream and automatically move collateral between the two in their collateral management programmes. For example  it will take time to align collateral rules and schedules across markets so that market participants can have a single view of their collateral across different markets  and then optimise appropriately.CCMS also allows real-time repo simulations and introduces real time repo simulations and introduces Clearstream’s artificial intelligence-based collateral solution  OSCAR (Own Selection Criteria with Automated Reasoning)  for the creation of collateral baskets.“Weeks ago we didn’t even have triparty repo but all these other features have landed at the same time ” said Everett. “I call it a quantum leap.”,neutral,0.06,0.94,0.01,mixed,0.22,0.34,0.44,True,English,"['Canadian Market', 'Automation', 'T+1', 'new Canadian Collateral Management Service', 'Canadian Dollar Offer Rate', 'average collateral reuse processes', 'third party collateral management', 'big five Canadian banks', 'domestic tri-party repo capabilities', 'international central securities depository', 'triparty collateral management platform', 'financial resource management', 'Toronto Stock Exchange', 'Deutsche Börse', 'domestic tri-party repos', 'existing custody relationships', 'balance sheet pressure', 'Higher collateral velocity', 'market readiness period', 'Market Practices Adviso', 'post trade innovation', 'BMO Capital Markets', 'T+1 settlement deadlines', 'Canadian Depository', 'new platform', 'Canadian market', 'Canadian clients', 'Canadian Infrastructure', 'triparty repo', 'Collateral efficiency', 'collateral providers', 'repo market', 'Markets Media', 'US markets', 'money markets', 'bilateral repo', 'post-trade infrastructure', 'market participants', 'two worlds', 'unlimited substitution', 'manual intervention', 'simultaneous promise', 'economic effect', 'collateralized loan', 'custodian bank', 'nine hops', 'top minutes', 'behavioural change', 'data interface', 'account information', 'other countries', 'different parts', 'funding costs', 'general theme', 'global basis', 'inaugural trades', 'funding mechanism', 'Other users', 'asset managers', 'insurance companies', 'one place', 'simple way', 'complex products', 'positive volumes', 'Nicholas Chan', 'settlement cycle', 'settlement engine', 'settlement periods', 'repo trade', 'trade accounts', 'liquidity solutions', 'liquidity hub', 'first time', 'end lifecycle', 'two days', 'clearing bank', 'T+1 environment', 'Clearstream platform', 'TMX Group', 'one firm', 'Marton Szigeti', 'Steve Everett', 'CCMS automation', 'country', 'Germany', 'aim', 'head', 'fragmentation', 'ability', 'assets', 'Canada', '27 May', 'transition', 'security', 'date', 'price', 'cash', 'counterparty', 'contrast', 'parties', 'books', 'custodians', 'Technology', 'benefits', 'hours', 'speedboat', 'sea', 'tugboats', 'lending', 'development', '20 years', 'mirrored', 'testing', 'connectivity', 'interest', 'conversations', 'model', 'addition', 'industry', 'Increasing', 'participation', 'CIBC', 'RBC', 'Scotiabank', 'TD', 'disappearance', 'Banker', 'Acceptances', 'cessation', '28 June', 'corporates', 'alternative', 'type', 'pensions', 'vision', 'fall', 'chair', '12']",2024-05-21,2024-05-21,tradersmagazine.com

CASL not only tracks the performance of its underlying Cardano token ADA  recognised for its extensive academic peer-reviewed research  but also generates staking rewards. Admitted to the exchange as an Exchange Traded Product (ETP)  the product is already available to investors on the Swiss SIX exchange and as of 22 May on the regulated segment of Deutsche Börse XETRA (WKN A4AFBK  German ticker CSLE  ISIN code CH1327686056).More rewards  less management fee  higher profitabilityAccording to the co-founder of Liqwid Finance  Florian Volery  ""CASL combines the advantages of a traditional product with the staking rewards inherent in blockchain technology. It's accessible  cost-effective  effortless and secure. With CASL  we aim to take a transformative leap  one that will establish a new standard for digital asset management."" Until now  most financial instruments in the crypto sphere have granted access to underlying asset developments (Bitcoin  Ethereum  ADA  etc.)  but CASL offers more by redistributing staking rewards to investors.This dual return on investment  coupled with lower management fees (1.5%) provides investors with unparalleled benefits. Finally  the fund is fully backed by physical stocks of ADA tokens securely held in an offline (""cold"") wallet. CASL ETP provides instantaneous liquidity without any lock-in period  leveraging the flexibility of Cardano's blockchain.Cardano  one of the safest networks worldwideLiqwid  the company behind the innovative idea  carries out the staking of ETP's ADA tokens on the Cardano network  which has remained operational without any outages over the past five years. In contrast  its major competitors  such as Solana  Ethereum  and Avalanche  all based on proof-of-stake consensus  have experienced interruptions. Cardano's scientific-based technology is evidenced by a vibrant ecosystem of companies building innovative applications and supported by over 4.5 million wallets. Its network is widely regarded as the most decentralised and secure in existence. The Cardano blockchain has been adopted by the Refugees Agency of the United Nations (UNHCR) to help raise funds using staking to support people forced to flee.Story continuesFor Bruce Jackson  Head of Digital Assets at Apex Group  “There is a strong interest among investors for easily accessible crypto assets such as CASL. The first listing of CASL on the Swiss SIX Exchange on March 2024 proved the appetite for a new generation of crypto ETPs  enabling investors to earn returns but also contributes to the decentralisation of the network  a crucial aspect for blockchain to serve as a financial platform and create a more inclusive world.” Tim Brückmann  CASL partner and founder of IAMX  emphasises the potential of blockchain to bank the unbanked once digital ID is integrated  potentially onboarding millions of individuals onto the Cardano blockchain.To find out more: see attached factsheetPress Contact: press@liqwid.ch or +41 79 269 53 31About Liqwid FinanceLiqwid is a liquidity protocol for lending and borrowing Cardano native assets.

Furthermore  the activities are split by type: (i) subscription revenue  (ii) transaction revenue  (iii) license sales and (iv) project revenue.The traditional communication services are nearly exclusively volume-based and split into (i) hybrid digital activities and (ii) paper business.Digital service revenueRevenue growth is mostly in line with expectations for all regions with a low teens growth rate across geographies  except for the Nordic region  where divestment plans are currently ongoing  and the Balkan region due to government delays in activating new features on the eFaktura platformTransaction revenue growth was mostly flat year-on-year  reflecting subdued demand due to the macroeconomic environmentSubscription revenue growth was mainly driven by the increase in e-identity subscriptions.The number of subscription customers continued to grow in the quarter  while the ARPU 2 on subscription revenue decreased as this quarters increase in subscriptions was weighted towards e-identity services  which have a lower subscription revenue per useron subscription revenue decreased as this quarters increase in subscriptions was weighted towards e-identity services  which have a lower subscription revenue per user Project-related services such as implementations and follow-ups on change requests continued to decrease as the Group focused on onboarding new and existing clients to the centralised Banqup platform.Traditional communication servicesPostage and Parcel activities  developed only in the Nordics  continues to face declining volumes as we experience an increasing transition towards digital products. Meanwhile  pricing was adjusted upwards to compensate for the rising cost structure driven by inflation.Strengthening financial positionUnifiedpost continues to streamline its business model towards a complete digital landscape. Through our divestments  we aim to create partnerships to accelerate our digital growth and use the proceeds to reduce our debt and strengthen our cash position.The divestment of FitekIN / Onea and the ongoing negotiation on the sale of 21 Grams are on track  while the Group is considering other non-core divestments to focus on its digital growth.In May 2024  Unifiedpost converted 130.750 subscription rights into newly issued capital.

(Euronext: ONWD)  the medical technology company creating innovative spinal cord stimulation therapies to restore movement  function  and independence in people with spinal cord injury (SCI)  today announces the publication of global Up-LIFT pivotal trial results in Nature Medicine. The study achieved all primary safety and effectiveness endpoints  and ARC-EX Therapy demonstrated significant improvements in upper limb strength  function  and sensation among people with chronic tetraplegia due to cervical SCI.At the end of the trial  72% of trial participants were considered responders to non-invasive ARC-EX Therapy* based on a conservative definition requiring responders to meet improvement criteria in both strength and functional domains vs. standard of care rehabilitation alone. Notably  the number of responders increased to 90% when the definition included participants with improvements in at least one strength or functional outcome*.“Trial results far exceeded our hypothesis of a 50% response rate to ARC-EX Therapy  giving new hope to people with SCI and to rehabilitation providers ” said Chet Moritz  Ph.D.  publication lead author  co-Principal Investigator  and Professor of Electrical & Computer Engineering and Rehabilitation Medicine at the University of Washington. “After only two months  more than half of Up-LIFT participants achieved average improvements in grasp force greater than that required to lift filled cups and in pinch force equivalent to that required to pick up an item with a fork or insert a key.1 2 This indicates not only improved strength and function  but also the potential for greater independence with ARC-EX Therapy.”Study participants also reported reduced spasm frequency  improved sleep  and improved upper body sensation  including the sense of touch*. 87% of participants reported that ARC-EX Therapy delivered improvements in overall quality of life*. Self-care  a key component of independence after SCI  also improved significantly*.“Improvement in arm and hand function is among the highest priorities for people with tetraplegia3 who have endured far too long without effective therapies for functional recovery ” said Dave Marver  CEO  ONWARD Medical. “The findings published in Nature Medicine provide critical and compelling evidence that ARC-EX has the potential to restore independence in daily activities and improve quality of life. We are laser-focused on our commitment to bring this first-of-its-kind technology to the SCI Community as soon as possible.”“We are proud that ONWARD has developed this first-ever therapy shown to improve strength and function after chronic incomplete tetraplegia ” said ONWARD Medical co-founders Grégoire Courtine  PhD  Professor of Neuroscience and Neurotechnology at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Lausanne (EPFL)  and Jocelyne Bloch  MD  Head of Functional Neurosurgery at Lausanne University Hospital and Professor of Neurosurgery at EPFL. “We commend the outstanding researchers and study participants who contributed to this seminal trial.”ARC-EX Therapy is external  programmed electrical stimulation that targets the spinal cord non-invasively and is designed to aid in functional recovery after SCI. The Up-LIFT study was a prospective  single-arm pivotal study designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the ARC-EX System to treat upper extremity functional deficits in people with chronic tetraplegia. The global study was conducted with 65 participants at 14 leading SCI centers in the United States  Europe  and Canada.At the end of Q1  ONWARD Medical submitted a De Novo application to the US Food and Drug Administration for market clearance of the ARC-EX System. The Company plans to follow the US application with an application for market approval in Europe.On Thursday  May 23rd at 2:30pm CET/8:30am ET following a brief Q1 Business Update  CEO Dave Marver will host a discussion of Up-LIFT pivotal trial results with a panel of principal investigators and study participants.To join the webcast via Zoom  please register using this link.Participants may also join by phone:+32 2 290 9360 (Belgium)+33 1 7037 2246 (France)+49 69 3807 9884 (Germany)+31 20 794 0854 (Netherlands)+41 22 591 0156 (Switzerland)+44 203 481 5240 (United Kingdom)+1 346 248 7799 (US)Additional telephone numbers availableMeeting ID: 879 5741 2479A recording of the webcast will be available on the Company’s website following the live event.Note: All ONWARD® Medical devices and therapies  including but not limited to ARC-IM®  ARC-EX®  ARC-BCI™  and ARC Therapy™  alone or in combination with a brain-computer interface (BCI)  are investigational and not available for commercial use.About ONWARD MedicalONWARD® Medical is a medical technology company creating therapies to restore movement  function  and independence in people with spinal cord injury (SCI) and movement disabilities.

This success is due not only to our teams but also to our shareholders who have supported us and to our clients who took the risk of trusting a young independent SME.""Innovation Rooted in French Scientific ExcellenceENERTIME's technologies  based on thermodynamics combined with rotating machinery design  exploit a science born in France 200 years ago that is essential to the energy transition. They offer decarbonized and decentralized solutions as an alternative to centralized production solutions.Tailored Solutions for Industrial NeedsENERTIME provides customized systems for industrial clients  developing a unique ability to understand and address their issues  which fosters continuous and sustainable innovation.Strategic Vision Coupled with InnovationWith full ownership of its intellectual property and patents  ENERTIME can deploy its technologies  developed on Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) machines  in other fields. These capabilities are a significant asset for developing high-temperature  high-power heat pumps (HTHP). The natural gas expansion turbine installed for GRTgaz in Villiers-le-Bel and the partnership with STOLECT illustrate other successful applications of these technologies.Inherently Competitive TechnologiesA high-power ORC (typically 2 to 3 MW) for waste heat recovery is a very competitive solution with a typical LCOE[1] of €62/MWhe. A high temperature heat pump producing steam  reduces the CO2 emissions of steam production by a factor of ten in France and is 2 to 3 times more efficient than an electric boiler. It also avoids pollutant emissions associated with biomass or RDF[2] combustion. ENERTIME has developed these complex technologies without decarbonization subsidies  which were nonexistent before 2021  and plans to build 10 new machines in two years  in addition to the 12 commissioned between 2012 and 2023.Strong International AmbitionTo become competitive  decarbonization technologies must target a global market. ENERTIME has always aimed to develop relevant international solutions to compensate for a domestic market that take time to open. This strategy has led to successes on three continents and exports to eleven countries. ENERTIME expects most of its revenue to come from exports by 2030. In May 2024  ENERTIME was labeled an Efficient Solution for its ORC modules by the Solar Impulse Foundation and joined this global alliance.ABOUT ENERTIMECreated in 2008  ENERTIME designs  develops  and implements Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) machines  gaz expansion turbines and high temperature heat pumps for industrial energy efficiency and decentralized production of renewable energy. ORC machines convert heat into electricity. Heat pumps use low-temperature heat to produce high-temperature heat.ENERTIME is the only player offering ORC machines and a portfolio of technology in the field of thermodynamics for the energy transition. For ORC technology  it is one of the four main global players and the only French one fully mastering this technology of high-power machines (1 MW and more).

May 20  2024. Late-breaking data were presented from the NOTUS phase 3 study evaluating the investigational use of Dupixent® (dupilumab) as an add-on maintenance treatment in adults with uncontrolled COPD on maximal standard-of-care inhaled therapy (nearly all on triple therapy) and evidence of type 2 inflammation (i.e.  blood eosinophils ≥300 cells per μL). The NOTUS study confirmed the positive results demonstrated in the landmark phase 3 BOREAS study  with its data presented at a late-breaking session of the 2024 American Thoracic Society (ATS) International Conference and simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM).Surya Bhatt  M.D.  MSPHProfessor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham  Division of Pulmonary  Allergy  and Critical Care Medicine  and a co-principal investigator of the study“In my more than 20 years of practice  there have been limited advancements for patients struggling with the debilitating effects of uncontrolled COPD  and too many patients experience a vicious cycle of exacerbations that can result in loss of lung function and greatly diminish their quality of life. In NOTUS  dupilumab reduced exacerbations by a magnitude never seen before with an investigational biologic in a phase 3 COPD clinical study. These comprehensive results reinforce that  if approved  dupilumab could provide a first-of-its-kind medical advancement for the COPD community.”As presented and published  the NOTUS study met its primary and key secondary endpoints. All patients were on background maximal standard-of-care inhaled therapy (nearly all on triple therapy). Patients receiving Dupixent (n=470) experienced the following  compared to placebo (n=465):34% reduction in moderate or severe COPD exacerbations over 52 weeks (p<0.001)  the primary endpoint.over 52 weeks (p<0.001)  the primary endpoint. More than two times greater improvement in lung function (pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 ) from baseline at 12 weeks (139 mL vs. 57 mL; p<0.001)  with an improvement maintained at week 52 (115 mL vs. 54 mL; p=0.018)  secondary endpoints.(pre-bronchodilator FEV ) from baseline at 12 weeks (139 mL vs. 57 mL; p<0.001)  with an improvement maintained at week 52 (115 mL vs. 54 mL; p=0.018)  secondary endpoints. Numerically greater improvements in health-related quality of life from baseline at 52 weeks  a secondary endpoint  as defined by patient-reported outcomes (PRO) in the St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ).from baseline at 52 weeks  a secondary endpoint  as defined by patient-reported outcomes (PRO) in the St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). Numerically greater reductions in respiratory symptom severity from baseline to 52 weeks  a secondary endpoint  as defined by PROs in Evaluating Respiratory Symptoms in COPD (E-RS).The safety results were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. Overall rates of adverse events (AEs) were 67% for Dupixent and 66% for placebo. AEs more commonly observed with Dupixent than placebo included COVID-19 (9.4% Dupixent  8.2% placebo)  nasopharyngitis (6.2% Dupixent  5.2% placebo)  and headache (7.5% Dupixent  6.5% placebo). AEs more commonly observed with placebo than Dupixent included COPD (7.8% placebo  4.9% Dupixent). AEs leading to deaths were 2.6% for Dupixent and 1.5% for placebo.Dupixent is currently under Priority Review by the US Food and Drug Administration as an add-on maintenance treatment in certain adult patients with uncontrolled COPD with evidence of type 2 inflammation. The target action date is June 27  2024. Regulatory submissions are also under review in the European Union and China  and discussions with other regulatory authorities around the world are ongoing.The potential use of Dupixent in COPD is currently under clinical development  and its safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority in this setting.About COPDCOPD is a respiratory disease that damages the lungs and causes progressive lung function decline. Symptoms include persistent cough  breathlessness and excessive mucus production that may impair the ability to perform routine daily activities  which may lead to anxiety  depression and sleep disturbances. COPD is also associated with a significant health and economic burden due to recurrent acute exacerbations that require systemic corticosteroid treatment and/or lead to hospitalization. Smoking and exposure to noxious particles are key risk factors for COPD  but even individuals who quit smoking can still develop or continue having the disease. There have been no new treatment approaches approved for more than a decade. In the US  approximately 300 000 people live with uncontrolled COPD with evidence of type 2 inflammation.About the Dupixent COPD phase 3 study programBOREAS and NOTUS are replicate  randomized  phase 3  double-blind  placebo-controlled studies that evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in adults who were current or former smokers with moderate-to-severe COPD. Patients were aged 40 to 80 years in BOREAS and 40 to 85 years in NOTUS. All 1 874 patients enrolled in BOREAS and NOTUS had evidence of type 2 inflammation  as measured by blood eosinophils ≥300 cells per µL. Patients with a diagnosis or history of asthma were excluded from the studies.During the 52-week treatment period  patients in BOREAS and NOTUS received Dupixent or placebo every two weeks added to a maximal standard-of-care inhaled triple therapy of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)  long-acting beta agonists (LABA)  and long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA). Double maintenance therapy  which included LABA and LAMA  was allowed if ICS was contraindicated.The primary endpoint for BOREAS and NOTUS evaluated the annualized rate of acute moderate or severe COPD exacerbations. Moderate exacerbations were defined as those requiring systemic steroids and/or antibiotics. Severe exacerbations were defined as those requiring hospitalization; requiring more than a day of observation in an emergency department or urgent care facility; or resulting in death. Key secondary endpoints included change from baseline in lung function (assessed by pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume [FEV1]) at 12 and 52 weeks  change from baseline at 52 weeks in SGRQ total score compared to placebo  and safety.Data from BOREAS were also published in the New England Journal of Medicine.About Sanofi and Regeneron’s COPD Clinical Research ProgramSanofi and Regeneron are motivated to transform the treatment paradigm of COPD by examining the role different types of inflammation play in the disease progression through the investigation of two potentially first-in-class biologics  Dupixent and itepekimab.Dupixent inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and the program focuses on a specific population of people with evidence of type 2 inflammation. Itepekimab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits interleukin-33 (IL-33)  an initiator and amplifier of broad inflammation in COPD.Itepekimab is currently under clinical investigation  with two phase 3 studies currently enrolling  and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.About DupixentDupixent is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in phase 3 studies  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are two of the key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in more than 60 countries in one or more indications including certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)  prurigo nodularis and chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) in different age populations. More than 850 000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical studies involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in phase 3 studies  including chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritus of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About RegeneronRegeneron (NASDAQ: REGN) is a leading biotechnology company that invents  develops and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

May 20  2024. Late-breaking data were presented from the NOTUS phase 3 study evaluating the investigational use of Dupixent ® (dupilumab) as an add-on maintenance treatment in adults with uncontrolled COPD on maximal standard-of-care inhaled therapy (nearly all on triple therapy) and evidence of type 2 inflammation (i.e.  blood eosinophils ‰¥300 cells per Î¼L). The NOTUS study confirmed the positive results demonstrated in the landmark phase 3 BOREAS study  with its data presented at a late-breaking session of the 2024 American Thoracic Society (ATS) International Conference and simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM).Surya Bhatt  M.D.  MSPHProfessor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham  Division of Pulmonary  Allergy  and Critical Care Medicine  and a co-principal investigator of the studyIn my more than 20 years of practice  there have been limited advancements for patients struggling with the debilitating effects of uncontrolled COPD  and too many patients experience a vicious cycle of exacerbations that can result in loss of lung function and greatly diminish their quality of life. In NOTUS  dupilumab reduced exacerbations by a magnitude never seen before with an investigational biologic in a phase 3 COPD clinical study. These comprehensive results reinforce that  if approved  dupilumab could provide a first-of-its-kind medical advancement for the COPD community.As presented and published  the NOTUS study met its primary and key secondary endpoints. All patients were on background maximal standard-of-care inhaled therapy (nearly all on triple therapy). Patients receiving Dupixent (n=470) experienced the following  compared to placebo (n=465):34% reduction in moderate or severe COPD exacerbations over 52 weeks (pover 52 weeks (p More than two times greater improvement in lung function (pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 ) from baseline at 12 weeks (139 mL vs. 57 mL; p(pre-bronchodilator FEV ) from baseline at 12 weeks (139 mL vs. 57 mL; p Numerically greater improvements in health-related quality of life from baseline at 52 weeks  a secondary endpoint  as defined by patient-reported outcomes (PRO) in the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ).from baseline at 52 weeks  a secondary endpoint  as defined by patient-reported outcomes (PRO) in the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). Numerically greater reductions in respiratory symptom severity from baseline to 52 weeks  a secondary endpoint  as defined by PROs in Evaluating Respiratory Symptoms in COPD (E-RS).The safety results were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. Overall rates of adverse events (AEs) were 67% for Dupixent and 66% for placebo. AEs more commonly observed with Dupixent than placebo included COVID-19 (9.4% Dupixent  8.2% placebo)  nasopharyngitis (6.2% Dupixent  5.2% placebo)  and headache (7.5% Dupixent  6.5% placebo). AEs more commonly observed with placebo than Dupixent included COPD (7.8% placebo  4.9% Dupixent). AEs leading to deaths were 2.6% for Dupixent and 1.5% for placebo.Dupixent is currently under Priority Review by the US Food and Drug Administration as an add-on maintenance treatment in certain adult patients with uncontrolled COPD with evidence of type 2 inflammation. The target action date is June 27  2024. Regulatory submissions are also under review in the European Union and China  and discussions with other regulatory authorities around the world are ongoing.The potential use of Dupixent in COPD is currently under clinical development  and its safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority in this setting.About COPDCOPD is a respiratory disease that damages the lungs and causes progressive lung function decline. Symptoms include persistent cough  breathlessness and excessive mucus production that may impair the ability to perform routine daily activities  which may lead to anxiety  depression and sleep disturbances. COPD is also associated with a significant health and economic burden due to recurrent acute exacerbations that require systemic corticosteroid treatment and/or lead to hospitalization. Smoking and exposure to noxious particles are key risk factors for COPD  but even individuals who quit smoking can still develop or continue having the disease. There have been no new treatment approaches approved for more than a decade. In the US  approximately 300 000 people live with uncontrolled COPD with evidence of type 2 inflammation.About the Dupixent COPD phase 3 study programBOREAS and NOTUS are replicate  randomized  phase 3  double-blind  placebo-controlled studies that evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in adults who were current or former smokers with moderate-to-severe COPD. Patients were aged 40 to 80 years in BOREAS and 40 to 85 years in NOTUS. All 1 874 patients enrolled in BOREAS and NOTUS had evidence of type 2 inflammation  as measured by blood eosinophils ‰¥300 cells per µL. Patients with a diagnosis or history of asthma were excluded from the studies.During the 52-week treatment period  patients in BOREAS and NOTUS received Dupixent or placebo every two weeks added to a maximal standard-of-care inhaled triple therapy of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)  long-acting beta agonists (LABA)  and long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA). Double maintenance therapy  which included LABA and LAMA  was allowed if ICS was contraindicated.The primary endpoint for BOREAS and NOTUS evaluated the annualized rate of acute moderate or severe COPD exacerbations. Moderate exacerbations were defined as those requiring systemic steroids and/or antibiotics. Severe exacerbations were defined as those requiring hospitalization; requiring more than a day of observation in an emergency department or urgent care facility; or resulting in death. Key secondary endpoints included change from baseline in lung function (assessed by pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume [FEV1]) at 12 and 52 weeks  change from baseline at 52 weeks in SGRQ total score compared to placebo  and safety.Data from BOREAS were also published in the New England Journal of Medicine.About Sanofi (NASDAQ: ) and Regeneron (NASDAQ: )'s COPD Clinical Research ProgramSanofi and Regeneron are motivated to transform the treatment paradigm of COPD by examining the role different types of inflammation play in the disease progression through the investigation of two potentially first-in-class biologics  Dupixent and itepekimab.Dupixent inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and the program focuses on a specific population of people with evidence of type 2 inflammation. Itepekimab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits interleukin-33 (IL-33)  an initiator and amplifier of broad inflammation in COPD.Itepekimab is currently under clinical investigation  with two phase 3 studies currently enrolling  and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.About DupixentDupixent is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in phase 3 studies  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are two of the key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in more than 60 countries in one or more indications including certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)  prurigo nodularis and chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) in different age populations. More than 850 000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical studies involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in phase 3 studies  including chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritus of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About RegeneronRegeneron (NASDAQ: REGN) is a leading biotechnology company that invents  develops and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

It also delisted its shares on Dublin’s Euronext that day.Its shares are currently trading at around $83 each in New York  giving the company a $57bn market capitalisation.Since September 25 last year  the Iseq 20 – which tracks the performance of Ireland’s biggest listed companies such as Ryanair  Bank of Ireland  Kerry Group and Glanbia – has climbed 17.7pc.Gainers on the Iseq 20 over the past eight months include Glanbia  which has risen about 16pc. Shares in Ryanair have also climbed about 16pc in that time  while AIB is up 23pc and insulation giant Kingspan is up 32pc.CRH  whose CEO is Albert Manifold  shifted its primary listing to New York as the US becomes an increasingly important market for the group.Last year  CRH generated revenue of $34.9bn  with about $20.5bn of that in the United States. In terms of earnings before interest  tax  depreciation and amortisation (Ebitda)  the US accounted for 75pc of the total $6.2bn it generated last year.As it moved its primary listing to New York last year  CRH said the US is expected to be a “key driver” for the group’s future growth due to continued economic expansion  a growing population and significant construction needs.“As the leading building materials solutions business in North America  CRH is uniquely positioned to capitalise on the strong growth opportunities in the US construction market  underpinned by long-term structural tailwinds from federal  state and municipal funding support ” it added.Shares in gambling giant Flutter  which owns Paddy Power  have barely budged since the company secured a listing in New York at the end of January. Flutter is in the process of moving its primary listing from London to New York at the end of this month.It’s also hoping to capitalise on the growth of its FanDuel brand in the US  where it has become the leading online sportsbetting company after a string of states legalised sportsbetting.Flutter’s shares were trading at $212 when they began changing hands in New York at the end of January  rose to $225 in mid-March and are currently trading at around $208. That gives it a market capitalisation of $37bn.Flutter chief executive Peter Jackson previously said that potential investors in the US like to see companies reporting under US GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting Practices).“They also like to see companies listed on their domestic exchanges. It gives people a lot more comfort in their ability to invest ” Mr Jackson said last year  adding that a lack of stamp duty on share trades  and high levels of equity liquidity are also helpful for investors.Releasing first-quarter results recently  Flutter said FanDuel performed strongly in the period  seeing 15pc year-on-year growth in average monthly players.,neutral,0.14,0.85,0.02,positive,0.68,0.3,0.01,True,English,"['CRH shares', 'US', 'move', 'Iseq', 'shade', 'leading building materials solutions business', 'Flutter chief executive Peter Jackson', 'Irish building materials giant CRH', 'leading online sportsbetting company', 'New York Stock Exchange', 'insulation giant Kingspan', 'past eight months', 'continued economic expansion', 'significant construction needs', 'long-term structural tailwinds', 'municipal funding support', 'average monthly players', 'gambling giant Flutter', '$57bn market capitalisation', 'strong growth opportunities', 'biggest listed companies', 'US construction market', 'primary share listing', 'Mr Jackson', 'important market', 'share trades', 'primary listing', 'Albert Manifold', 'key driver', 'future growth', 'growing population', 'North America', 'federal, state', 'Paddy Power', 'Accounting Practices', 'domestic exchanges', 'stamp duty', 'high levels', 'equity liquidity', 'first-quarter results', 'year growth', 'United States', 'FanDuel brand', 'potential investors', 'US GAAP', 'Iseq 20 index', 'Kerry Group', 'performance', 'shares', 'Dublin', 'Ireland', 'favour', 'September', 'London', 'Euronext', 'Ryanair', 'Bank', 'Glanbia', 'Gainers', 'time', 'AIB', 'CEO', 'revenue', 'terms', 'earnings', 'interest', 'tax', 'depreciation', 'amortisation', 'Ebitda', '75pc', 'total', 'end', 'January', 'process', 'string', 'hands', 'mid-March', 'people', 'comfort', 'ability', 'lack', 'period', '15pc']",2024-05-20,2024-05-21,independent.ie

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today presented late-breaking data from the NOTUS Phase 3 trial evaluating the investigational use of Dupixent® (dupilumab) as an add-on maintenance treatment in adults with uncontrolled COPD on maximal standard-of-care inhaled therapy (nearly all on triple therapy) and evidence of type 2 inflammation (i.e.  blood eosinophils ≥300 cells per μL). The NOTUS trial confirmed the positive results demonstrated in the landmark Phase 3 BOREAS trial  with its data presented at a late-breaking session of the 2024 American Thoracic Society (ATS) International Conference and simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM).“In my more than 20 years of practice  there have been limited advancements for patients struggling with the debilitating effects of uncontrolled COPD  and too many patients experience a vicious cycle of exacerbations that can result in loss of lung function and greatly diminish their quality of life ” said Surya Bhatt  M.D.  MSPH  Professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham  Division of Pulmonary  Allergy  and Critical Care Medicine and a co-principal investigator of the trial. “In NOTUS  dupilumab reduced exacerbations by a magnitude never seen before with an investigational biologic in a Phase 3 COPD clinical trial. These comprehensive results reinforce that  if approved  dupilumab could provide a first-of-its-kind medical advancement for the COPD community.”As presented and published  the NOTUS trial met its primary and key secondary endpoints. All patients were on background maximal standard-of-care inhaled therapy (nearly all on triple therapy). Patients receiving Dupixent (n=470) experienced the following  compared to placebo (n=465):34% reduction in moderate or severe COPD exacerbations over 52 weeks (p<0.001)  the primary endpoint.over 52 weeks (p<0.001)  the primary endpoint. More than two times greater improvement in lung function (pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 ) from baseline at 12 weeks (139 mL vs. 57 mL; p<0.001)  with an improvement maintained at week 52 (115 mL vs. 54 mL; p=0.018)  secondary endpoints.(pre-bronchodilator FEV ) from baseline at 12 weeks (139 mL vs. 57 mL; p<0.001)  with an improvement maintained at week 52 (115 mL vs. 54 mL; p=0.018)  secondary endpoints. Numerically greater improvements in health-related quality of life from baseline at 52 weeks  a secondary endpoint   as defined by patient-reported outcomes (PRO) in the St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ).from baseline at 52 weeks  a secondary endpoint as defined by patient-reported outcomes (PRO) in the St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). Numerically greater reductions in respiratory symptom severity from baseline to 52 weeks  a secondary endpoint  as defined by PROs in Evaluating Respiratory Symptoms in COPD (E-RS).The safety results were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. Overall rates of adverse events (AE) were 67% for Dupixent and 66% for placebo. AEs more commonly observed with Dupixent than placebo included COVID-19 (9.4% Dupixent  8.2% placebo)  nasopharyngitis (6.2% Dupixent  5.2% placebo)  and headache (7.5% Dupixent  6.5% placebo). AEs more commonly observed with placebo than Dupixent included COPD (7.8% placebo  4.9% Dupixent). AEs leading to deaths were 2.6% for Dupixent and 1.5% for placebo.Dupixent is currently under Priority Review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as an add-on maintenance treatment in certain adult patients with uncontrolled COPD with evidence of type 2 inflammation. The target action date is June 27  2024. Regulatory submissions are also under review in the European Union and China  and discussions with other regulatory authorities around the world are ongoing.The potential use of Dupixent in COPD is currently under clinical development  and its safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority in this setting.About COPDCOPD is a respiratory disease that damages the lungs and causes progressive lung function decline. Symptoms include persistent cough  breathlessness and excessive mucus production that may impair the ability to perform routine daily activities  which may lead to anxiety  depression and sleep disturbances. COPD is also associated with a significant health and economic burden due to recurrent acute exacerbations that require systemic corticosteroid treatment and/or lead to hospitalization. Smoking and exposure to noxious particles are key risk factors for COPD  but even individuals who quit smoking can still develop or continue having the disease. There have been no new treatment approaches approved for more than a decade. In the U.S.  approximately 300 000 people live with uncontrolled COPD with evidence of type 2 inflammation.About the Dupixent COPD Phase 3 Trial ProgramBOREAS and NOTUS are replicate  randomized  Phase 3  double-blind  placebo-controlled trials that evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in adults who were current or former smokers with moderate-to-severe COPD. Patients were aged 40 to 80 years in BOREAS and 40 to 85 years in NOTUS. All 1 874 patients enrolled in BOREAS and NOTUS had evidence of type 2 inflammation  as measured by blood eosinophils ≥300 cells per µL. Patients with a diagnosis or history of asthma were excluded from the trials.During the 52-week treatment period  patients in BOREAS and NOTUS received Dupixent or placebo every two weeks added to a maximal standard-of-care inhaled triple therapy of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)  long-acting beta agonists (LABA)  and long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA). Double maintenance therapy  which included LABA and LAMA  was allowed if ICS was contraindicated.The primary endpoint for BOREAS and NOTUS evaluated the annualized rate of acute moderate or severe COPD exacerbations. Moderate exacerbations were defined as those requiring systemic steroids and/or antibiotics. Severe exacerbations were defined as those requiring hospitalization; requiring more than a day of observation in an emergency department or urgent care facility; or resulting in death. Key secondary endpoints included change from baseline in lung function (assessed by pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume [FEV1]) at 12 and 52 weeks  change from baseline at 52 weeks in SGRQ total score compared to placebo  and safety.Data from BOREAS were previously published in the New England Journal of Medicine.About Regeneron and Sanofi’s COPD Clinical Research ProgramRegeneron and Sanofi are motivated to transform the treatment paradigm of COPD by examining the role different types of inflammation play in the disease progression through the investigation of two potentially first-in-class biologics  Dupixent and itepekimab.Dupixent inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and the program focuses on a specific population of people with evidence of type 2 inflammation. Itepekimab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits interleukin-33 (IL-33)  an initiator and amplifier of broad inflammation in COPD.Itepekimab is currently under clinical investigation  with two Phase 3 trials currently enrolling  and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.About DupixentDupixent  which was invented using Regeneron’s proprietary VelocImmune® technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are two of the key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in more than 60 countries in one or more indications including certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)  prurigo nodularis  and chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) in different age populations. More than 850 000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.About Regeneron's VelocImmune® TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder  President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create a substantial portion of all original  FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Dupixent  Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent® (alirocumab)  Kevzara® (sarilumab)  Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb® (atoltivimab  maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritus of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. INDICATIONSDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe eczema (atopic dermatitis or AD) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today presented late-breaking data from the NOTUS Phase 3 trial evaluating the investigational use of Dupixent® (dupilumab) as an add-on maintenance treatment in adults with uncontrolled COPD on maximal standard-of-care inhaled therapy (nearly all on triple therapy) and evidence of type 2 inflammation (i.e.  blood eosinophils ≥300 cells per μL). The NOTUS trial confirmed the positive results demonstrated in the landmark Phase 3 BOREAS trial  with its data presented at a late-breaking session of the 2024 American Thoracic Society (ATS) International Conference and simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM).“In my more than 20 years of practice  there have been limited advancements for patients struggling with the debilitating effects of uncontrolled COPD  and too many patients experience a vicious cycle of exacerbations that can result in loss of lung function and greatly diminish their quality of life ” said Surya Bhatt  M.D.  MSPH  Professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham  Division of Pulmonary  Allergy  and Critical Care Medicine and a co-principal investigator of the trial. “In NOTUS  dupilumab reduced exacerbations by a magnitude never seen before with an investigational biologic in a Phase 3 COPD clinical trial. These comprehensive results reinforce that  if approved  dupilumab could provide a first-of-its-kind medical advancement for the COPD community.”As presented and published  the NOTUS trial met its primary and key secondary endpoints. All patients were on background maximal standard-of-care inhaled therapy (nearly all on triple therapy). Patients receiving Dupixent (n=470) experienced the following  compared to placebo (n=465):34% reduction in moderate or severe COPD exacerbations over 52 weeks (p<0.001)  the primary endpoint.over 52 weeks (p<0.001)  the primary endpoint. More than two times greater improvement in lung function (pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 ) from baseline at 12 weeks (139 mL vs. 57 mL; p<0.001)  with an improvement maintained at week 52 (115 mL vs. 54 mL; p=0.018)  secondary endpoints.(pre-bronchodilator FEV ) from baseline at 12 weeks (139 mL vs. 57 mL; p<0.001)  with an improvement maintained at week 52 (115 mL vs. 54 mL; p=0.018)  secondary endpoints. Numerically greater improvements in health-related quality of life from baseline at 52 weeks  a secondary endpoint   as defined by patient-reported outcomes (PRO) in the St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ).from baseline at 52 weeks  a secondary endpoint as defined by patient-reported outcomes (PRO) in the St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). Numerically greater reductions in respiratory symptom severity from baseline to 52 weeks  a secondary endpoint  as defined by PROs in Evaluating Respiratory Symptoms in COPD (E-RS).The safety results were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. Overall rates of adverse events (AE) were 67% for Dupixent and 66% for placebo. AEs more commonly observed with Dupixent than placebo included COVID-19 (9.4% Dupixent  8.2% placebo)  nasopharyngitis (6.2% Dupixent  5.2% placebo)  and headache (7.5% Dupixent  6.5% placebo). AEs more commonly observed with placebo than Dupixent included COPD (7.8% placebo  4.9% Dupixent). AEs leading to deaths were 2.6% for Dupixent and 1.5% for placebo.Dupixent is currently under Priority Review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as an add-on maintenance treatment in certain adult patients with uncontrolled COPD with evidence of type 2 inflammation. The target action date is June 27  2024. Regulatory submissions are also under review in the European Union and China  and discussions with other regulatory authorities around the world are ongoing.The potential use of Dupixent in COPD is currently under clinical development  and its safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority in this setting.About COPDCOPD is a respiratory disease that damages the lungs and causes progressive lung function decline. Symptoms include persistent cough  breathlessness and excessive mucus production that may impair the ability to perform routine daily activities  which may lead to anxiety  depression and sleep disturbances. COPD is also associated with a significant health and economic burden due to recurrent acute exacerbations that require systemic corticosteroid treatment and/or lead to hospitalization. Smoking and exposure to noxious particles are key risk factors for COPD  but even individuals who quit smoking can still develop or continue having the disease. There have been no new treatment approaches approved for more than a decade. In the U.S.  approximately 300 000 people live with uncontrolled COPD with evidence of type 2 inflammation.About the Dupixent COPD Phase 3 Trial ProgramBOREAS and NOTUS are replicate  randomized  Phase 3  double-blind  placebo-controlled trials that evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in adults who were current or former smokers with moderate-to-severe COPD. Patients were aged 40 to 80 years in BOREAS and 40 to 85 years in NOTUS. All 1 874 patients enrolled in BOREAS and NOTUS had evidence of type 2 inflammation  as measured by blood eosinophils ≥300 cells per µL. Patients with a diagnosis or history of asthma were excluded from the trials.During the 52-week treatment period  patients in BOREAS and NOTUS received Dupixent or placebo every two weeks added to a maximal standard-of-care inhaled triple therapy of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)  long-acting beta agonists (LABA)  and long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA). Double maintenance therapy  which included LABA and LAMA  was allowed if ICS was contraindicated.The primary endpoint for BOREAS and NOTUS evaluated the annualized rate of acute moderate or severe COPD exacerbations. Moderate exacerbations were defined as those requiring systemic steroids and/or antibiotics. Severe exacerbations were defined as those requiring hospitalization; requiring more than a day of observation in an emergency department or urgent care facility; or resulting in death. Key secondary endpoints included change from baseline in lung function (assessed by pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume [FEV1]) at 12 and 52 weeks  change from baseline at 52 weeks in SGRQ total score compared to placebo  and safety.Data from BOREAS were previously published in the New England Journal of Medicine.About Regeneron and Sanofi’s COPD Clinical Research ProgramRegeneron and Sanofi are motivated to transform the treatment paradigm of COPD by examining the role different types of inflammation play in the disease progression through the investigation of two potentially first-in-class biologics  Dupixent and itepekimab.Dupixent inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and the program focuses on a specific population of people with evidence of type 2 inflammation. Itepekimab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits interleukin-33 (IL-33)  an initiator and amplifier of broad inflammation in COPD.Itepekimab is currently under clinical investigation  with two Phase 3 trials currently enrolling  and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.About DupixentDupixent  which was invented using Regeneron’s proprietary VelocImmune® technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are two of the key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in more than 60 countries in one or more indications including certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)  prurigo nodularis  and chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) in different age populations. More than 850 000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.About Regeneron's VelocImmune® TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder  President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create a substantial portion of all original  FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Dupixent  Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent® (alirocumab)  Kevzara® (sarilumab)  Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb® (atoltivimab  maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritus of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. INDICATIONSDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe eczema (atopic dermatitis or AD) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi (NASDAQ: ) today presented late-breaking data from the NOTUS Phase 3 trial evaluating the investigational use of Dupixent ® (dupilumab) as an add-on maintenance treatment in adults with uncontrolled COPD on maximal standard-of-care inhaled therapy (nearly all on triple therapy) and evidence of type 2 inflammation (i.e.  blood eosinophils ‰¥300 cells per Î¼L). The NOTUS trial confirmed the positive results demonstrated in the landmark Phase 3 BOREAS trial  with its data presented at a late-breaking session of the 2024 American Thoracic Society (ATS) International Conference and simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM).In my more than 20 years of practice  there have been limited advancements for patients struggling with the debilitating effects of uncontrolled COPD  and too many patients experience a vicious cycle of exacerbations that can result in loss of lung function and greatly diminish their quality of life  said Surya Bhatt  M.D.  MSPH  Professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham  Division of Pulmonary  Allergy  and Critical Care Medicine and a co-principal investigator of the trial. In NOTUS  dupilumab reduced exacerbations by a magnitude never seen before with an investigational biologic in a Phase 3 COPD clinical trial. These comprehensive results reinforce that  if approved  dupilumab could provide a first-of-its-kind medical advancement for the COPD community.As presented and published  the NOTUS trial met its primary and key secondary endpoints. All patients were on background maximal standard-of-care inhaled therapy (nearly all on triple therapy). Patients receiving Dupixent (n=470) experienced the following  compared to placebo (n=465):34% reduction in moderate or severe COPD exacerbations over 52 weeks (p<0.001)  the primary endpoint.over 52 weeks (p<0.001)  the primary endpoint. More than two times greater improvement in lung function (pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 ) from baseline at 12 weeks (139 mL vs. 57 mL; p<0.001)  with an improvement maintained at week 52 (115 mL vs. 54 mL; p=0.018)  secondary endpoints.(pre-bronchodilator FEV ) from baseline at 12 weeks (139 mL vs. 57 mL; p<0.001)  with an improvement maintained at week 52 (115 mL vs. 54 mL; p=0.018)  secondary endpoints. Numerically greater improvements in health-related quality of life from baseline at 52 weeks  a secondary endpoint   as defined by patient-reported outcomes (PRO) in the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ).from baseline at 52 weeks  a secondary endpoint as defined by patient-reported outcomes (PRO) in the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). Numerically greater reductions in respiratory symptom severity from baseline to 52 weeks  a secondary endpoint  as defined by PROs in Evaluating Respiratory Symptoms in COPD (E-RS).The safety results were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. Overall rates of adverse events (AE) were 67% for Dupixent and 66% for placebo. AEs more commonly observed with Dupixent than placebo included COVID-19 (9.4% Dupixent  8.2% placebo)  nasopharyngitis (6.2% Dupixent  5.2% placebo)  and headache (7.5% Dupixent  6.5% placebo). AEs more commonly observed with placebo than Dupixent included COPD (7.8% placebo  4.9% Dupixent). AEs leading to deaths were 2.6% for Dupixent and 1.5% for placebo.Dupixent is currently under Priority Review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as an add-on maintenance treatment in certain adult patients with uncontrolled COPD with evidence of type 2 inflammation. The target action date is June 27  2024. Regulatory submissions are also under review in the European Union and China  and discussions with other regulatory authorities around the world are ongoing.The potential use of Dupixent in COPD is currently under clinical development  and its safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority in this setting.About COPDCOPD is a respiratory disease that damages the lungs and causes progressive lung function decline. Symptoms include persistent cough  breathlessness and excessive mucus production that may impair the ability to perform routine daily activities  which may lead to anxiety  depression and sleep disturbances. COPD is also associated with a significant health and economic burden due to recurrent acute exacerbations that require systemic corticosteroid treatment and/or lead to hospitalization. Smoking and exposure to noxious particles are key risk factors for COPD  but even individuals who quit smoking can still develop or continue having the disease. There have been no new treatment approaches approved for more than a decade. In the U.S.  approximately 300 000 people live with uncontrolled COPD with evidence of type 2 inflammation.About the Dupixent COPD Phase 3 Trial ProgramBOREAS and NOTUS are replicate  randomized  Phase 3  double-blind  placebo-controlled trials that evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in adults who were current or former smokers with moderate-to-severe COPD. Patients were aged 40 to 80 years in BOREAS and 40 to 85 years in NOTUS. All 1 874 patients enrolled in BOREAS and NOTUS had evidence of type 2 inflammation  as measured by blood eosinophils ‰¥300 cells per µL. Patients with a diagnosis or history of asthma were excluded from the trials.During the 52-week treatment period  patients in BOREAS and NOTUS received Dupixent or placebo every two weeks added to a maximal standard-of-care inhaled triple therapy of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)  long-acting beta agonists (LABA)  and long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA). Double maintenance therapy  which included LABA and LAMA  was allowed if ICS was contraindicated.The primary endpoint for BOREAS and NOTUS evaluated the annualized rate of acute moderate or severe COPD exacerbations. Moderate exacerbations were defined as those requiring systemic steroids and/or antibiotics. Severe exacerbations were defined as those requiring hospitalization; requiring more than a day of observation in an emergency department or urgent care facility; or resulting in death. Key secondary endpoints included change from baseline in lung function (assessed by pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume [FEV1]) at 12 and 52 weeks  change from baseline at 52 weeks in SGRQ total score compared to placebo  and safety.Data from BOREAS were previously published in the New England Journal of Medicine.About Regeneron and Sanofi's COPD Clinical Research ProgramRegeneron and Sanofi are motivated to transform the treatment paradigm of COPD by examining the role different types of inflammation play in the disease progression through the investigation of two potentially first-in-class biologics  Dupixent and itepekimab.Dupixent inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and the program focuses on a specific population of people with evidence of type 2 inflammation. Itepekimab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits interleukin-33 (IL-33)  an initiator and amplifier of broad inflammation in COPD.Itepekimab is currently under clinical investigation  with two Phase 3 trials currently enrolling  and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.About DupixentDupixent  which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune ® technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are two of the key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in more than 60 countries in one or more indications including certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)  prurigo nodularis  and chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) in different age populations. More than 850 000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.About Regeneron's VelocImmune ® TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder  President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite ® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create a substantial portion of all original  FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes REGEN-COV ® (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Dupixent  Libtayo ® (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent ® (alirocumab)  Kevzara ® (sarilumab)  Evkeeza ® (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb ® (atoltivimab  maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritus of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. INDICATIONSDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe eczema (atopic dermatitis or AD) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies.
