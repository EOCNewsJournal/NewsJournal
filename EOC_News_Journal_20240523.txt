Up to â‚¬3B only this year  90% goes for Ukraine's military "" Lipavsky said on X.Following the start of Russia's special military operation  the US-led West slapped widespread sanctions on Moscow  including freezing Russian assets worth approximately 300 billion euros ($329 billion). The bulk of this sum  approximately 200 billion euros ($221 billion)  is being held in the European Union  predominantly in accounts at Euroclear  a European central securities depository.Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said that the EU plan to seize Russian central bank assets was an ""escalation of economic aggression"" and a trade war  and warned that Russia would respond in a correspondingly harsh manner. She said that any attempt to confiscate Russian assets would be a gross violation of the West's own law  international rules and bilateral obligations.Â© SputnikNEWS LETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address",neutral,0.02,0.93,0.05,negative,0.02,0.2,0.78,True,English,"['Frozen Russian Assets', 'Czech Foreign Minister', 'EU', 'Use', 'Income', 'Ukraine', 'Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova', 'Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky', 'GlobalSecurity.org mailing list', 'European central securities depository', 'Russian central bank assets', 'Ukrainian armed forces', 'The European Union', 'special military operation', 'Frozen Russian Assets', 'widespread sanctions', '200 billion euros', 'economic aggression', 'trade war', 'harsh manner', 'gross violation', 'international rules', 'bilateral obligations', 'NEWS LETTER', 'Email Address', 'US-led West', 'Sputnik News', 'EU plan', 'Use', 'Income', 'Ukraine', 'MOSCOW', 'revenues', 'Tuesday', 'sum', 'X.', 'start', 'bulk', 'accounts', 'Euroclear', 'escalation', 'attempt', 'law']",2024-05-22,2024-05-23,globalsecurity.org

She added that the amount raised would help Ukraine not just through 2025 but further down the line.“Our hope would be to show that those assets do provide a viable stream of support in the years to come ” she told reporters ahead of meetings with her G-7 counterparts. “This is an assured source of financing and it’s important that Russia realize that we will not be deterred from supporting Ukraine for lack of resources.”Story continuesKey IssueItalian Finance Minister Giancarlo Giorgetti struck a similarly positive note  saying he is “optimistic” on this “key issue” and that the hope is to present the G-7 leaders with a plan.“The problem is what legal basis we have ” he told reporters. “It’s not simple  we’re working on it we need to be a bit creative. Currently legally the idea is to use the interest to repay the loans we give to Ukraine. The issue is we have to see if that’s feasible.”His German counterpart  Christian Lindner  also highlighted that “there are many unresolved issues  many unanswered questions here.”“Now is an opportunity to talk about it ” he said. “However  I don’t expect any decisions to be made  the matter is too complex for that  there are still far too many questions open.”The EU has separately already agreed to provide Ukraine twice a year with the profits from the frozen funds as they are generated. The US has been pushing to leverage those profits to be able to provide Kyiv with more money up front  with the future proceeds covering that outlay. The frozen assets are expected to raise about $5 billion a year.Should the G-7 come to an agreement  that accord would replace the EU initiative.An advantage of front-loading the proceeds from the assets would be to secure the benefit for Ukraine regardless of political uncertainty surrounding the presidential election in the US. Divisions in Washington have already made it difficult for President Joe Biden to extend more aid to Ukraine  and his challenger  former President Donald Trump  has expressed skepticism about support for the embattled country.Stumbling BlocksStill  officials caution that a lot of key details still need to be agreed given uncertainties surrounding the assets’ continued immobilization and the various technical aspects of this plan.Should the war come to an end and some kind of peace settlement is struck with Russia  with Moscow agreeing to pay for Ukraine’s reconstruction  that would raise questions over whether the assets would remain frozen and  if not  what guarantees would be provided for repaying the loan.Another uncertainty may stem from the fact that the EU has to renew its decision on keeping the assets immobilized every six months if the initiative is structured as a sanction  a procedure that would require unanimity. While unlikely  that raises the risk that a single EU nation could throw loan repayments into doubt by blocking a continued freeze.The European Central Bank and EU member states are also concerned about protecting Belgian-based Euroclear  which holds most of the assets  from any financial risk  for example from Russian lawsuits or possible retaliation from Moscow. Under the EU’s current initiative the clearing house retains the profits generated before Feb. 15 to cover those scenarios and a mechanism has been put in place to hold back more funds should the risks prove greater than anticipated.--With assistance from Alberto Nardelli  Jorge Valero  Alessandra Migliaccio  Kamil Kowalcze  Zoe Schneeweiss and Caroline Connan.(Updates with Giorgetti  Lindner starting in 11th paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek©2024 Bloomberg L.P.,neutral,0.05,0.74,0.22,mixed,0.13,0.29,0.59,True,English,"['Frozen Russian Assets', 'G-7 Closing', 'US-Led Push', 'Italian Finance Minister Giancarlo Giorgetti', 'US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen', 'former President Donald Trump', 'military offensive gaining ground', 'The European Central Bank', 'Russian central bank funds', 'President Joe Biden', 'various technical aspects', 'many unresolved issues', 'single EU nation', 'EU member states', 'many critical details', 'many unanswered questions', 'sustainable financial support', 'assets’ continued immobilization', 'Finance ministers', 'The US', 'military needs', 'many questions', 'The Group', 'Russian lawsuits', 'key details', 'continued freeze', 'US proposal', 'Russian assets', 'Seven countries', 'political shifts', 'future revenue', 'broad strokes', 'exact mechanism', 'participating parties', 'one thing', 'medium-term assistance', 'strong signal', 'viable stream', 'assured source', 'positive note', 'legal basis', 'German counterpart', 'Christian Lindner', 'presidential election', 'Stumbling Blocks', 'peace settlement', 'Belgian-based Euroclear', 'possible retaliation', 'critical financing', 'financial risk', 'Key Issue', 'US plan', 'G-7 governments', 'G-7 economies', 'G-7 allies', 'G-7 counterparts', 'massive loan', 'final decision', 'future proceeds', 'EU initiative', 'political uncertainty', 'loan repayments', 'G-7 leaders', 'frozen assets', 'Bloomberg', 'value', 'move', 'Ukraine', 'sides', 'Atlantic', 'Officials', 'discussions', 'Kyiv', 'matter', 'meeting', 'Stresa', 'Italy', 'aim', 'options', 'June', 'agreement', 'people', 'talks', 'size', 'amount', 'consensus', 'war', 'signs', 'abating', 'focus', 'Moscow', 'stake', 'defense', 'debt', 'money', 'reconstruction', 'line', 'hope', 'years', 'reporters', 'lack', 'resources', 'Story', 'problem', 'idea', 'interest', 'loans', 'opportunity', 'decisions', 'profits', 'outlay', 'accord', 'advantage', 'benefit', 'Divisions', 'Washington', 'aid', 'challenger', 'skepticism', 'country', 'lot', 'uncertainties', 'end', 'kind', 'guarantees', 'fact', 'sanction', 'procedure', 'unanimity', 'doubt', 'example']",2024-05-23,2024-05-23,finance.yahoo.com

Loading...President Vladimir Putin has signed a decree that could lead to the seizure of U.S. assets in Russia. This comes as a countermeasure to any potential confiscation of Russian assets frozen in the U.S.What Happened: The decree comes amid ongoing discussions by G7 negotiators on how to leverage approximately $300 billion of Russian financial assets  including major currencies and government bonds  frozen after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022  Reuters reported on Thursday.According to officials  despite dwindling foreign investment limiting Russia’s ability for a like-for-like retaliation  the country may target private investors’ cash.The decree allows a Russian entity to seek compensation through a Russian court if its property is unjustifiably seized. The court could then order compensation in the form of U.S. assets or property in Russia.See Also: GameStop  AMC Entertainment Shares Spike Monday Afternoon: What’s Going On?U.S.-owned assets potentially liable for seizure include securities  stakes in Russian companies  real estate  movable property  and property rights.Former president Dmitry Medvedev acknowledged that Russia’s response would likely focus on private individuals’ assets  as the country holds a minimal amount of American state property.Assets of foreign investors  including individuals and major U.S. investment funds  are held in special “type-C” accounts introduced by Russia after its invasion of Ukraine. Funds in these accounts cannot be transferred out of Russia without permission from Russian authorities.The U.S. has passed legislation allowing President Joe Biden‘s administration to confiscate Russian assets held in American banks and transfer them to Ukraine  a move Russia has repeatedly deemed illegal.Why It Matters: The threat of asset seizure has been looming since April 2024  when Russia warned of retaliation over the potential seizure of its frozen assets to aid Ukraine. Valentina Matviyenko  the speaker of the Russian upper house of parliament said Russia is ready to react strongly if its frozen assets are seized.The Hermitage Capital CEO had urged the use of $300B frozen Russian assets to stop the Ukraine war in early May. ""At the end of the day  this is a war of resources. If Ukraine runs out of resources  Russia wins. One way to stop Ukraine from running out of resources is to give them the $300 billion that was frozen of Russian central bank assets "" he said.Earlier this week  EU member states approved a plan to divert earnings from those assets  which have amassed about €3.9 billion ($4.23 billion) in the past year  to Ukraine‘s war effort against Moscow’s invasion. The funds are being managed by a Belgium-based financial service and clearing company  Euroclear. Under the EU plan  $3.3 billion would reach Ukraine this year.Read Next: 69% Of Voters  Including Majority Of Republicans  Support Marijuana Legalization: Did You Catch That  Biden And Trump?Photo by Salma Bashir Motiwala on ShutterstockThis story was generated using Benzinga Neuro and edited by Pooja Rajkumari",neutral,0.04,0.66,0.3,negative,0.02,0.27,0.71,True,English,"['US Assets', 'Potential Seizure', 'Frozen Assets', 'Russia', 'Response', 'major U.S. investment funds', 'The Hermitage Capital CEO', 'Former president Dmitry Medvedev', 'U.S.-owned assets', 'Russian central bank assets', '$300B frozen Russian assets', 'The U.S.', 'dwindling foreign investment', 'President Vladimir Putin', 'U.S. assets', 'Belgium-based financial service', 'Salma Bashir Motiwala', 'Russian upper house', 'private investors’ cash', 'EU member states', 'President Joe Biden', 'Russian financial assets', 'special “type-C” accounts', 'private individuals’ assets', 'American state property', 'frozen assets', 'major currencies', 'foreign investors', 'Russian entity', 'Russian companies', 'Russian authorities', 'American banks', 'Russian court', 'potential confiscation', 'ongoing discussions', 'G7 negotiators', 'government bonds', 'AMC Entertainment', 'real estate', 'minimal amount', 'Valentina Matviyenko', 'early May', 'One way', 'past year', 'clearing company', 'EU plan', 'Marijuana Legalization', 'Benzinga Neuro', 'Pooja Rajkumari', 'movable property', 'property rights', 'war effort', 'asset seizure', 'potential seizure', 'Ukraine war', 'decree', 'countermeasure', 'invasion', 'February', 'Reuters', 'Thursday', 'officials', 'ability', 'retaliation', 'country', 'compensation', 'GameStop', 'Spike', 'Afternoon', 'securities', 'stakes', 'response', 'permission', 'legislation', 'administration', 'move', 'threat', 'April', 'speaker', 'parliament', 'end', 'resources', 'earnings', 'Moscow', 'Euroclear', 'Voters', 'Majority', 'Republicans', 'Trump', 'Photo', 'Shutterstock', 'story']",2024-05-23,2024-05-23,benzinga.com

Soitec will offer X-FAB’s customers easy access to the SmartSiC™ substrate through a joint supply chain consignment model.X-FAB is the pioneer and leader of the foundry model in the fast-growing SiC market. Silicon carbide (SiC) is a disruptive compound semiconductor material with intrinsic properties providing superior performance and efficiency over silicon in power applications.SmartSiC™ is a proprietary Soitec technology based on the company’s SmartCut™ process  in which a thin layer of a high-quality monocrystalline (mono-SiC) ‘donor’ wafer is split off and bonded to a low resistivity polycrystalline (poly-SiC) ‘handle’ wafer. The resulting substrate offers improved device performance and manufacturing yields. The process allows multiple re-uses of a single donor wafer  significantly reducing cost and related CO 2 emissions.In this fast-growing market  Soitec is ramping production of SmartSiC™ substrates at its new plant of Bernin  near Grenoble (France). X-FAB is increasing production capacity for SiC devices at the Lubbock plant. The use of the SmartSiC™ substrate enables X-FAB’s customers to design smaller devices  resulting in efficiency improvements through an increased number of dies per wafer. The benefit of reduced CO 2 emissions from the substrate manufacturing process will also contribute to X-FAB's initiative to reduce its overall carbon footprint.Sophie Le-Guyadec VP Procurement of X-FAB  states: “As the leading SiC foundry  we want to provide our customers the full range of opportunities to design innovative and robust SiC devices for electric vehicles  renewable power and industrial applications. To offer the most advanced silicon carbide processes and manufacturing capabilities  we jointly agreed to provide our customers easy access to Soitec’s innovative SmartSiC™ via a consignment model.”Emmanuel Sabonnadiere  Soitec Executive Vice President Automotive and Industry comments: “Soitec’s SmartSiC substrates and X-FAB’s foundry services are a perfect fit to meet increasing demand for new SiC products. This cooperation is a significant milestone for the deployment of SmartSiC in the U.S. market and internationally  thanks to X-FAB’s global footprint.”About X-FABX-FAB is the leading analog/mixed-signal and MEMS foundry group manufacturing silicon wafers for automotive  industrial  consumer  medical and other applications. Its customers worldwide benefit from the highest quality standards  manufacturing excellence and innovative solutions by using X-FAB’s modular CMOS and SOI processes in geometries ranging from 1.0 µm to 110 nm  and its special silicon carbide and MEMS long-lifetime processes.

(Euronext Growth Paris: ALVIO)  a clinical-stage biotechnology company specializing in the development of innovative drugs targeting tumor DNA Damage Response (DDR) and driver oncogenes  today announced the completion of dosing for the first cohort of subjects in its Phase 1/2 trial of lead candidate  VIO-01  a pan-DDR decoy for the treatment of solid tumors.VIO-01 is the next-generation DNA decoy generated from Valerio Therapeutics’ proprietary PlatON platform. An optimized product with modifications for increased half-life  plasma stability and tumor targeting  VIO-01 is a potent pan-DDR trapper capable of abrogating multiple DNA damage pathways including homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining. The pan trapping nature of VIO-01 allows for treatment of a wide range of potential solid tumor indications rather than restrictions to BRCA1/2 mutations or HRD positivity as with other DNA damage inhibitors.The Clinical Review Committee (CRC) is composed of Valerio Therapeutics Medical and Safety teams as well as Principal Investigators convened to review all available and relevant safety information from the first cohort of 3 patients. No clinically significant adverse events or serious adverse events were reported and no MTD was declared  allowing the Clinical Review Committee to unanimously agree to escalate to the second dose cohort.The VIO-01-101 Phase 1b portion of the trial aims to determine to recommended phase 2 dose and/or pharmacologically active dose in patients with selected solid tumors including  HRD+ Ovarian cancer  BRCA1/2 mutant Breast Cancer  HRR mutated prostate cancer  and solid tumors with HRR mutations. The dose escalation to clinically relevant exposures and safety expansion is expected to continue through 2024.Dr. Shefali Agarwal  Chairwoman of the Board of Directors and CEO  stated:""The result of this meeting represents one of the key milestones in the development of VIO-01 and the PlatON platform. This is an import step on our way to becoming a leader in the development of innovative drugs with unique mechanisms of action. We are pleased with the encouraging tolerability seen in this first cohort of patients and look forward to bringing this drug-candidate another step closer to patients.

Al…,"Resolution 23  being the ordinary resolution to approve the waiver by the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers under Rule 9 of the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers (the ""Rule 9 waiver"") in connection with the Company's buyback programme was duly passed by 77.06% of the votes cast by the independent shareholders of the Company (being shareholders other than Olive and its presumed concert parties) with 22.94% of votes cast against. Resolution 23 is a standing agenda item at each Annual General Meeting to enable CCEP to exercise the authorities under Resolution 26 to purchase its own shares on market and Resolution 27 to purchase its own shares off market  which were passed with majorities of 99.85% and 99.51% respectively. This will enable CCEP to make use of the option to return value to shareholders through a possible future buyback programme. Had Resolution 23 not been passed  the Company would not have been able to effect such buyback programmes  as explained in the Notice of AGM and also in the Letter to Shareholders issued via RNS on 10 May 2024. CCEP intends to continue to engage with ISS on their standing policy to generally recommend a vote against Rule 9 waivers which we believe may be a contributing factor in influencing investor decisions in this regard. In addition  CCEP will continue to engage  in normal course and as appropriate  with shareholders who did not support Resolution 23 to understand the reasons for their vote against the proposal and to continue a transparent and constructive dialogue on this topic.Olive is currently interested in 166 128 987 shares in the Company and the Waiver does not entitle Olive to be interested in a greater number of shares. The Waiver would allow Olive's interest in shares as a percentage of the Company's total shares to increase as a result of the exercise of the Company's authorities to purchase its own shares  but only to the extent that the resulting interest of Olive  together with any concert parties  in the shares of the Company did not then exceed 40.1034%.In accordance with Listing Rule 14.3.6R  copies of the resolutions that do not constitute ordinary business at an annual general meeting will be submitted to the National Storage Mechanism and will shortly be available for inspection at https://data.fca.org.uk/#/nsm/nationalstoragemechanism.CONTACTS Company Secretariat Investor Relations Media Relations Clare Wardle Sarah Willett Shanna Wendt T +44 (0)20 7355 8406 T +44 (0)7970 145 218 T +44 (0)7976 595 168ABOUT CCEPCCEP is one of the leading consumer goods companies in the world.

The product provides a centralized view of the progress of all questionnaires  so that users can quickly see what information has been received  where the source documents are located  and which files have been completed and assessed.Users can amend questionnaires on the fly  with a full audit trail  as they receive updates from clients  removing the need to send emails back and forth to request data. DossierFlow helps do away with fragmented information coming from different sources.The product enables constant communication with customers and a daily summary of status updates. It also offers secure transfer and storage of files with SOC (Service Organization Control) type 1 and 2 certification  widely recognized information security standards.“It is well documented that the workload of accountants is increasing in the Netherlands and elsewhere  further raising already-high stress levels ” Kniphorst said. “A solution like DossierFlow can help address these issues for practitioners  given that it can save time and boost productivity while also increasing accuracy.”About Wolters KluwerWolters Kluwer (EURONEXT: WKL) is a global leader in information  software solutions and services for professionals in healthcare; tax and accounting; financial and corporate compliance; legal and regulatory; corporate performance and ESG.

The alfapump is the Company’s fully implantable  wirelessly charged device for patients with recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis and received breakthrough device designation from the US FDA in 2019.The PMA application for the alfapump system  which was based on the successful execution of Sequana Medical’s pivotal POSEIDON study  was accepted for substantive review on 29 January 2024. Following a review of this application by the FDA  the Company received a “Day 90” major deficiency letter and a “Day 100” meeting was held with FDA to align on key findings. The FDA confirmed completion of the substantive review and no further new questions on the clinical study or the pre-clinical data  unless related to the Company’s response to the “Day 90” Letter. The FDA had a number of non-clinical questions that require additional work and the Company currently anticipates to submit this additional information by the end of September 2024. In light of the FDA’s feedback and the rapidly evolving cybersecurity environment  the Company intends to exclude RPMS/DirectLink (the software for remote uploading of performance data from the alfapump) from the PMA application and the initial alfapump commercialisation  and to submit a next-generation version in a PMA supplement post-approval.The Company now forecasts FDA approval before the end of Q1 2025  with no change to the planned US commercial launch in H2 2025. The Company continues to evaluate its financing options to achieve FDA approval and prepare for commercial launch of the alfapump.Timur Resch  Global Vice President QM/QA/RA at Sequana Medical  commented: “The receipt of the PMA Day 90 letter and completion of the Day 100 meeting is another huge milestone for Sequana  and reflects the significant amount of work by the team for the preparation of the marketing application. We appreciate the positive interaction with the FDA and believe that the outstanding questions are manageable. We intend to complete these activities in time for a response to the FDA by the end of Q3 this year.”Ian Crosbie  Chief Executive Officer of Sequana Medical  commented: “We are very pleased with the progress of our alfapump PMA application and grateful for the collaborative nature of discussions with the FDA for our breakthrough device. The completion of the substantive review and confirmation there will be no further new questions related to the clinical study data or pre-clinical data  unless related to our responses  is a very important event for us  providing clarity on the approval path forward and derisking the alfapump program. We look forward to addressing the remaining questions from FDA and anticipate approval before the end of Q1 2025.”--- END ---For more information  please contact:Sequana MedicalIan Crosbie  CEOE: IR@sequanamedical.comT: +44 7973 42 99 17About alfapump in recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosisRecurrent or refractory ascites is a severe condition characterized by the accumulation of fluid in the abdomen. The current standard treatment involves therapeutic paracentesis  an invasive and burdensome procedure that drains ascites from the abdomen using a large needle over an extended period. If approved by the FDA  the alfapump could become the first active implantable medical device in the US that automatically and continuously removes ascites from the abdomen into the bladder  where it is naturally eliminated through urination.The PMA application submitted to the US FDA was based on the successful execution of Sequana Medical’s pivotal POSEIDON study  a landmark study across 18 centers in the US and Canada with a total of 69 patients implanted with the alfapump. The primary effectiveness endpoints at six months post-implantation in the Pivotal Cohortii exceeded the predefined thresholds with statistical significance  and primary safety endpoint data was in line with expectationsiii. Data at 12 months post-implantation continued to show a strong and durable clinical profile  virtually eliminating the need for therapeutic paracentesis and delivering a clinically meaningful improvement in patients’ quality of lifeiv.Data from the patient preference study and a matched cohort analysis of the NACSELD-III registry with the POSEIDON Pivotal Cohort indicated that US patients have a strong preference for the alfapump vs standard paracentesis procedures and that the safety profile of the alfapump is comparable to standard of care.The North American market of recurrent and refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis is forecast to grow on average 9% per year  from approximately 78 000 patients in 2025 reaching 147 000 patients by 2032  primarily driven by the increasing prevalence of NASHv. The total market opportunity for alfapump is estimated at $2.4 billion in 2025  including approximately $600 million from the Company’s initial priority market targeting patients requiring at least 12 paracentes per year. To date  over 1 000 alfapump systems have been implanted.About Sequana MedicalSequana Medical NV is a pioneer in treating fluid overload  a serious and frequent clinical complication in patients with liver disease  heart failure and cancer. This causes major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care  they become ineffective  untolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing ""diuretic-resistant"" patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  delivering major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients and reducing costs for healthcare systems.The Company's Premarket Approval (PMA) application for the alfapump was submitted to the US FDA in December 2023 and accepted for substantive review in January 2024  having reported positive primary and secondary endpoint data from the North American pivotal POSEIDON study in recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis. US market approval of the alfapump is anticipated before the end of Q1 2025 with US commercial launch planned for H2 2025.Results of the Company's RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure support DSR's mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE  a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study  have been successfully treated with DSR  resulting in a dramatic improvement in diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements. The independent Data Safety Monitoring Board approved the start of the randomized MOJAVE cohort of up to a further 30 patients  which is planned after alfapump US PMA approval.Sequana Medical is listed on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent  Belgium.

In the United States and Canada  the alfapump system is currently under clinical investigation (POSEIDON Trial) and is being studied in adult patients with refractory or recurrent ascites due to liver cirrhosis. DSR® therapy is still in development and it should be noted that any statements regarding safety and efficacy arise from ongoing pre-clinical and clinical investigations which have yet to be completed. There is no link between DSR therapy and ongoing investigations with the alfapump system in Europe  the United States or Canada.Note: alfapump® and DSR® are registered trademarks.Forward-looking statementsThis press release may contain predictions  estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking statements.Such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance.

MACK-3 is composed of HOMA-IR  AST and CK-18 and has been validated against histology as a diagnostic marker for active MASH/NASH with fibrosis. The authors demonstrated that the decrease in MACK-3 value at the end of a 24 week-treatment period was significantly higher among the patients treated with lanifibranor which were qualified as responders for the histological endpoints of “MASH/NASH resolution and fibrosis improvement”  “Fibrosis improvement without worsening of MASH/NASH” and “MASH/NASH resolution without fibrosis worsening  compared to patients treated with lanifibranor but qualified as non-responders for the endpoints. Similar results were observed for improvement of NAS  SAF  and individual liver lesions: steatosis  lobular inflammation  and ballooning. MACK-3 improvement correlated as well as with increase of adiponectin levels and decrease of Pro-C3  a circulating marker of fibrogenesis  following therapy with lanifibranor. These results warrant additional study to evaluate MACK-3 as a potential marker for the evaluation of a treatment response to lanifibranor.The second abstract evaluates the effect of the pan-PPAR agonist  lanifibranor  on the improvement of liver histology as well as vascular alterations in a model of early MASLD. An increase in intrahepatic vascular resistance related to endothelial dysfunction in MASLD can be a potential driver of disease progression. The authors demonstrated that in a model of early MASLD  lanifibranor improved steatosis  normalized the mean arterial blood pressure  strongly decreased the portal pressure in-vivo and normalized the transhepatic pressure gradient ex-vivo. Furthermore  lanifibranor also decreased the reactivity to the vasoconstrictor methoxamine and normalized the hyporeactivity to vasodilator acetylcholine. The results from the collaboration between the University of Antwerp and Inventiva support the role of intrahepatic vascular alterations in the development of MASLD-related portal hypertension as well as in the progression to MASH and highlight the potential of lanifibranor in addressing all the components of MASH disease.The details of the presentations are as follows:Abstracts :Abstract #1 title: ""Improvements in MACK-3  a diagnostic test for active metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis  parallel response to lanifibranor therapy"" Poster identifier: SAT-206 Presentation type: Poster presentation Authors: Michael P Cooreman  Sven Francque  Philippe Huot-Marchant  Lucile Dzen  Martine Baudin  Jean-Louis Junien  Pierre Broqua  Manal F Abdelmalek  Jérôme Boursier Date: Saturday June 8  2024 – 8:30-17:00 (CEST)Abstract #2 title: ""Altered liver vascular biology occurring in early stages of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease is significantly improved by the pan-peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonist lanifibranor  associating with improved liver histology"" Poster identifier: THU-258-YI Presentation type: Poster presentation Authors: Shivani Chotkoe  Guillaume Wettstein  Jean-Louis Junien  Luisa Vonghia  Denise van der Graaff  Joris De Man  Benedicte De Winter  Wilhelmus J.

As AI demands new ways to ingest and access massive volumes of data  Ngenea for AI helps teams speed up performance  simplify data management and open their data assets to new AI-powered use cases.Ngenea for AI is the companion to two Ngenea editions for Media & Entertainment and HPC customers  respectively. The new Ngenea for AI empowers AI innovators to speed up their ingest performance and access their unstructured data from a unified  global name space. Kalray debuted Ngenea for AI at Dell Technologies World 2024 in Las Vegas  where the software's performance on Dell servers is being showcased in the Kalray Booth #1026.The generative AI (GenAI) market is predicted to see 42% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) across the next 10 years into a $1.3 trillion space  from just $40 billion in 2022 (Bloomberg Intelligence). Yet innovative AI constructs such as large language models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)  and applications including Smart Vision and GenAI  are challenging the ability of IT systems to move data to and from their massive data stores.Enabling GenAI and RAGNgenea for AI adds data indexing and search capabilities  which users can leverage to feed any data to Smart Vision  GenAI and RAG applications effortlessly. The new offering enables AI customers to fully harness their existing assets when deploying GenAI applications  regardless of where the data is stored. These GenAI and RAG capabilities simplify and automate what would otherwise be a complex workflow from a data management aspect.”Fast AI processing is mission-critical to our business of detecting railcar anomalies before they lead to breakdowns or derailments. With Ngenea deployed along with Dell Technologies products  Duos achieved a 120x performance boost on our Railcar Inspection Portal (RIP®) solution  and an 8x increase in inspection accuracy. Working with Kalray helped us put railroads at the forefront of innovation ” said Jeff Necciai  chief technology officer of Duos Technologies.High-Performance Storage Tier to Feed GPUs EffortlesslyThe Ngenea for AI platform also incorporates a high-performance storage tier for the most data-intensive AI workloads. The tier is powered by a proven high-performance parallel file system that can easily manage petabytes of data and billions of files – whether data live on the edge  in the cloud  or on premises. This allows customers and partners to maximize the value of their GPU investment  without rip-and-replace deployments.With Ngenea  AI innovators:Accelerate AI workflows by optimizing AI data pipelines and enhancing the overall speed and efficiency of AI operations.by optimizing AI data pipelines and enhancing the overall speed and efficiency of AI operations.

For example  when integrating Ngenea with Perifery Vision AI  users can intuitively search for historical content across a vast amount of data on locations  types  and collections.“Traditional data centers weren't built for massive data sets found in AI workloads – or to process these workloads rapidly and efficiently “ said Eric Baissus  CEO of Kalray. “Kalray's Ngenea for AI is the data acceleration platform for the AI age – software that elevates performance on existing servers and storage and provides toolkits that streamline application integration. With our software  enterprises and service providers can feed GPUs effortlessly - optimizing data movement and orchestration as the foundation of their infrastructure - so that AI genuinely delivers a competitive edge.“The Ngenea for AI platform joins two other Ngenea editions that streamline application integration for specific use cases: Ngenea for HPC – providing scratch storage  or storage for temporary user data  and Ngenea for Media & Entertainment – to accelerate post-production workflows.Ngenea for AI is available today from Dell  from Kalray and select partners.

The freight market and strong year-over-year demand growth offer clear indications that the market is beginning to tighten. Looking forward  the demand outlook is broadly optimistic  firmly supported by limited fleet supply growth  particularly in the Capesize segment. The Company has over the last three years returned over $1 billion  or $5.1 per share in dividends to its shareholders  largely due to the modern fleet and industry low cash break even rates. Given its fleet profile and significant exposure to the trades offering the greatest upside  the Company has the potential to generate significant returns to its shareholders in the coming years.”The Board of DirectorsGolden Ocean Group LimitedHamilton  BermudaMay 22  2024Questions should be directed to:Lars-Christian Svensen: Chief Executive Officer  Golden Ocean Management AS+47 22 01 73 40Peder Simonsen: Chief Financial Officer  Golden Ocean Management AS+47 22 01 73 40The full report is available in the link below.Forward-Looking StatementsMatters discussed in this earnings report may constitute forward-looking statements.

The financial statements3 were approved by the Board of Directors during its meeting today.Pierre Barnabé  Soitec’s CEO  commented: “Fiscal year 2024 was a challenging year  marked by the impact on our sales of RF-SOI inventories correction across the entire smartphone value chain. Despite these difficult market conditions  we succeeded in maintaining a solid level of profitability  while continuing to invest both in innovation and industrial capacity to prepare for the future.Regarding our fiscal year 2025  the RF-SOI inventory correction will continue to impact our revenue through the first part of the year. However  we are seeing early signs of improvement downstream  led by the ongoing return to growth of the smartphone market  which gives us confidence in the recovery of our RF-SOI sales in the second half of the year. At the same time  we will continue to benefit from strong performance of our other SOI products  and from the successful expansion of our product portfolio  with increased penetration of POI and the ramp-up of SmartSiCTM.Looking ahead  we remain very confident in our ability to leverage the significant growth drivers underpinning our three end-markets. Coupled with the increasing adoption of engineered substrates to deliver more powerful and energy-efficient solutions to a growing number of customers  our continued diversification and expansion of our product portfolio  in both SOI and Compound substrates  supports our clear vision towards $2bn revenue in the medium term  with significant margin expansion potential ” added Pierre Barnabé.Fourth quarter FY’24 consolidated revenueQ4’24 Q4’23 Q4’24/Q4’23 (Euros millions) change reported chg. at const. exch. rates & perimeter Mobile Communications 222 220 +1% +1% Automotive & Industrial 44 47 -6% -6% Smart Devices 70 77 -9% -9% Total revenue 337 344 -2% -2%Soitec revenue reached 337 million Euros in the fourth quarter of FY’24  down 2% both on a reported basis and at constant exchange rates and perimeter4 against the record quarterly revenue of 344 million Euros achieved in the fourth quarter of FY’23.Mobile CommunicationsIn the fourth quarter of FY’24  Mobile Communications revenue reached 222 million Euros  up 1% year-on-year at constant exchange rates compared to the fourth quarter of FY’23 and up 71% sequentially compared to the third quarter of FY’24.As mentioned in previous quarterly publications  Soitec revenue has been affected since the beginning of fiscal year 2024 by the ongoing inventory adjustment of RF-SOI products at its customers level. In the fourth quarter of FY’24  RF-SOI revenue benefited from some restocking by major customers in anticipation of a smartphone market recovery in calendar year 2024  and also from orders by new RF-SOI customers. This temporary sequential rebound means that RF-SOI inventories at foundries level remain high at the end of fiscal year 2024  which will impact RF-SOI revenue in the first half of FY’25. The early signs of improvement with some downstream inventory digestion at OEMs and Fabless level  supported by the ongoing penetration of high-end smartphones  are expected to support growth in the second half of FY’25.Sales of POI (Piezoelectric-on-Insulator) wafers dedicated to smartphone RF filters have been significantly growing quarter-over-quarter since the beginning of fiscal year 2024  with another sequential double-digit growth recorded in the fourth quarter of FY’24 compared to the third quarter of FY’24. POI activity benefited from the full impact of the two new customers in entered in production in the third quarter of FY’24 as well as a new US tier one customer in the fourth quarter of FY’24  pushing the total to eight  while more than ten customers are in the qualification phase.Sales of FD-SOI wafers continue to show year-on-year growth  demonstrating the value they bring to front end modules integrated in both 5G Sub-6 GHz and 5G mmWave smartphones.Automotive & IndustrialAutomotive & Industrial revenue reached 44 million Euros in the fourth quarter of FY’24  down 6% year-on-year at constant exchange rates compared to the fourth quarter of FY’23 and sequentially stable compared to the third quarter of FY’24.Soitec continues to leverage strong demand from the automotive industry  powered by increasing semiconductor content embedded in the latest generations of vehicles to enable more digitalization - autonomous and assisted driving  functional safety  infotainment – and higher electrification with notably the growing penetration of electric vehicles.Power-SOI wafers continued to show year-on-year growth in the fourth quarter of FY’24  essentially driven by higher volumes. Growing demand for Power-SOI  which enables infotainment  functional safety and Battery Management Systems  strengthens the roadmap towards 300mm substrates.In the fourth quarter of FY’24  FD-SOI wafers sales  which continued to be mostly driven by adoption for automotive microcontrollers  recorded a year-on-year decline in volumes due to a high comparison basis in the fourth quarter of FY’23. Looking ahead  strengthening demand from key IDMs for FD-SOI  notably for automotive radar and AI applications  supports Soitec’s product roadmap towards 18nm and beyond.Contribution of revenue generated by Soitec’s SmartSiCTM technology for future generations of electric vehicles has further increased in the fourth quarter of FY’24 compared to previous quarters but was slightly lower on a year-on-year basis as Soitec benefited in the fourth quarter of FY’23 from an initial installment in connection with its cooperation agreement with STMicroelectronics. Soitec’s SmartSiCTM roadmap is on track on all aspects: technology  industrial  supply and commercial. A second customer was secured last February. Production ramp-up at Soitec’s new plant dedicated to SmartSiC™ substrates is still expected from the second half of FY’25.Smart DevicesSmart Devices revenue reached 70 million Euros in the fourth quarter of FY’24  down 9% at constant exchange rates compared to the fourth quarter of FY’23  up 8% on sequential basis compared to the third quarter of FY’24.Products dedicated to Smart Devices are supporting the need for more complex sensors  higher connectivity functionalities and embedded intelligence  leading to more powerful and energy-efficient chips for Edge Artificial Intelligence  Image Sensors  Data Centers and Cloud Computing.Supported by structural demand for Edge Computing devices across consumer and industrial sectors  sales of FD-SOI wafers in the fourth quarter of FY’24 were broadly in line with revenue recorded in the fourth quarter of FY’23 as well as with the level achieved in the third quarter of FY’24.After low sales in the first half of FY’24  sales of Imager-SOI wafers for 3D imaging applications  rebounded in the third quarter of FY’24 and remained at a sound level in the fourth quarter of FY’24.Sales of Photonics-SOI wafers were lower than in the fourth quarter of FY’23  impacted by a challenging data center environment.FY’24 consolidated revenueFY’24 FY’23 FY’24/FY’23 (Euros millions) change reported chg. at const. exch. rates & perimeter Mobile Communications 611 731 -16% -16% Automotive & Industrial 163 141 +16% +16% Smart Devices 204 217 -6% -6% Total revenue 978 1 089 -10% -10%Overall  consolidated revenue reached 978 million Euros in FY’24  down 10% both on a reported basis and at constant exchange rates and perimeter5 compared to 1 089 million Euros in FY’23. This 10% decline is in line with Soitec’s latest guidance provided in early February 2024.The decline in revenue essentially reflects lower volumes  as well as an unfavorable mix effect. Performance was mixed across Soitec’s three end-markets:Mobile Communications revenue reached 611 million Euros in FY’24 (62% of total revenue)  down 16% on a reported basis and at constant exchange rates compared to FY’23. The decline reflects lower RF-SOI volumes in connection with the inventory adjustment resulting from the smartphone market slowdown in 2022 and 2023. It was  however  partly offset by a significant acceleration in POI and  to a lesser extent  growing FD-SOI penetration.revenue reached 611 million Euros in FY’24 (62% of total revenue)  down 16% on a reported basis and at constant exchange rates compared to FY’23.

It was  however  partly offset by a significant acceleration in POI and  to a lesser extent  growing FD-SOI penetration. Automotive & Industrial revenue amounted to 163 million Euros in FY’24 (17% of total revenue)  up 16% on a reported basis and at constant exchange rates compared to FY’23. This strong performance was essentially driven by a solid increase in Power-SOI wafer sales (mostly higher volumes  but also a favorable price / mix effect). Sales of automotive FD-SOI came a bit lower than in FY’23 which was a particularly high comparison basis. Soitec also benefited from the growth in revenue generated by SmartSiC TM technology.revenue amounted to 163 million Euros in FY’24 (17% of total revenue)  up 16% on a reported basis and at constant exchange rates compared to FY’23.

Sales of automotive FD-SOI came a bit lower than in FY’23 which was a particularly high comparison basis. Soitec also benefited from the growth in revenue generated by SmartSiC technology. Smart Devices revenue reached 204 million Euros in FY’24 (21% of total revenue)  down 6% on a reported basis and at constant exchange rates compared to FY’23. Solid growth in FD-SOI wafer sales was more than offset by lower sales of both Imager-SOI wafers and Photonics-SOI due to lower smartphone volumes and the weak data center environment respectively.EBITDA1 margin2 maintained at a robust levelConsolidated income statement (part 1)(Euros millions) FY’24 FY’23 % change Revenue 978 1 089 -10% Gross profit 332 402 -17% As a % of revenue 34.0% 37.0% Net research and development expenses (61) (64) -5% Selling  general and administrative expenses (63) (71) -12% Current operating income 208 267 -22% As a % of revenue 21.3% 24.5% EBITDA1 6 332 391 -15% As a % of revenue 34.0% 36.0%Despite the decrease in revenue  Soitec was able to reach a solid level of profitability with current operating income amounting to 208 million Euros in FY’24  down from 24.5% of revenue in FY’23 to 21.3% of revenue in FY’24:Reflecting the lower level of activity recorded in FY’24  gross profit reached 332 million Euros  down from 402 million Euros in FY’23. Gross margin declined from 37.0% of revenue in FY’23 to 34.0% in FY’24 as a result of lower utilization of Soitec industrial capacity resulting from lower volumes of RF-SOI wafers. The lower gross margin also reflects  to a lesser extent  an unfavorable mix effect. In addition  depreciation costs went higher due to previous capacity investments. These factors were slightly offset by the recognition of subsidies and strong cost management.reached 332 million Euros  down from 402 million Euros in FY’23.

These factors were slightly offset by the recognition of subsidies and strong cost management. Net R&D expenses decreased from 64 million Euros in FY’23 to 61 million Euros in FY’24  representing 6.3% of revenue. Lower net R&D expenses came as a result of higher subsidies. Gross R&D expenses before capitalization went up 12% to 137 million Euros  in line with the ambition to continue to invest in new products development. On the other hand  the Group benefited from the recognition of higher R&D subsidies mainly due to the IPCEI MECT program.decreased from 64 million Euros in FY’23 to 61 million Euros in FY’24  representing 6.3% of revenue. Lower net R&D expenses came as a result of higher subsidies. Gross R&D expenses before capitalization went up 12% to 137 million Euros  in line with the ambition to continue to invest in new products development. On the other hand  the Group benefited from the recognition of higher R&D subsidies mainly due to the IPCEI MECT program. Soitec also drove selling  general and administrative (SG&A) expenses down from 71 million Euros in FY’23 to 63 million Euros in FY’24  representing a slightly lower percentage of revenue  at 6.4% compared to 6.5% in FY’23. Salary inflation has been more than offset by an overall effort to contain external spendings  lower share-based compensation as well as favorable non-recurring effects. IT expenses went up  notably reflecting the Group’s efforts to strengthen cybersecurity.The EBITDA1 amounted to 332 million Euros in FY’24  down 15% from 391 million Euros in FY’23. EBITDA1 margin2 remained a robust level  reaching 34.0%  two points below the record 36.0% margin of FY’23. Despite a lesser absorption of fixed costs due to lower volumes and an unfavorable mix effect  Soitec achieved a strong industrial performance and kept a tight control over operating expenses in an inflationary context  while maintaining a high level of R&D investment.Consolidated income statement (part 2)(Euros millions) FY’24 FY’23 % change Operating income 205 268 -23% Net financial result (5) (10) Income tax (23) (26) Net profit from continuing operations 178 232 -23% Net profit from discontinued operations 0 1 Net profit  Group share 178 233 -23% Basic earnings per share (in €) 5.00 6.63 -25% Diluted earnings per share (in €) 4.88 6.41 -24% Weighted average number of ordinary shares 35 655 679 35 133 150 Weighted average number of diluted ordinary shares 37 710 587 37 240 396The net financial result was a net financial expense of 5 million Euros in FY’24 compared to a net financial expense of 10 million Euros in FY’23. In the context of rising interest rates  the Group benefited from a 14 million Euros increase in financial income mainly from cash investments  which more than offset a 6 million Euros increase in net financial expenses and a 4 million Euros impairment of financial investments.The income tax expense amounted to 23 million Euros in FY’24 compared to 26 million Euros in FY’23. The slightly higher effective tax rate of 11% compared to 10% in FY’23 reflects both a higher contribution from Soitec’s Singaporean operations to the Group’s results and lower deferred taxes on tax losses carryforwards.The net profit  Group share  amounted to 178 million  representing an 18.2% net margin.Free Cash Flow reflects seasonality and investments in mid-term growthConsolidated cash-flows(Euros millions) FY’24 FY’23 Continuing operations EBITDA1 332 391 Change in working capital (142) (96) Tax paid (25) (32) Net cash generated by operating activities 166 263 Net cash used in investing activities (209) (228) Free Cash Flow (43) 34 New loans and debt repayment (including finance leases)  drawing on credit lines (15) 32 Financial expenses (12) (7) Liquidity contract and other items (7) (4) Net cash (used in) / generated from financing activities (33) 20 Impact of exchange rate fluctuations (3) 6 Net change in cash (80) 60The Group generated a negative Free Cash Flow of 43 million Euros in FY’24 compared to a 34 million Euros positive Free Cash Flow in FY’23. This comes as a result of lower EBITDA  higher working capital needs  and capital expenditure maintained at a high level to support future expansion.The cash outflow from working capital amounted to 142 million Euros in FY’24  compared to 96 million Euros in FY’23. This is essentially reflecting:a 19 million Euros increase in inventories due to late changes in the customers demand leading to raw material inventory at the end of the year a 94 million Euros increase in trade receivables  explained by the seasonality of sales with high Q4’24 including a very high level in March  combined with an unfavorable customer mix a 45 million Euros decrease in trade payables  mainly due to non-recurring downpayments as the Group is increasing its supplier base for SOI products and securing new suppliers for its SmartSiCTM roadmap.The net cash used in investing activities amounted to 209 million Euros in FY’24  slightly lower than the 228 million Euros spent in FY’23. Including tools financed through leasing contracts (51 million Euros over FY’24)  total cash out related to investing activities amounted to 276 million Euros  slightly below the 290 million Euros initially planned  as the Group uses agility in deploying capacity in line with customer demand. This takes into account 17 million Euros of financial income from cash investment. Capital expenditure was essentially related to industrial investments:300-mm SOI production capacity investments  both in Bernin and in Singapore  including refresh capacity in Bernin 4the installation of the first SmartSiC™ production capacities and the second tranche of Bernin 4 work related to the extension of Singapore facility.Capital expenditure also included capitalized development costs  notably related to SmartSiC™ technology  investments supporting the Group’s environmental policy and IT investments.Net cash used in financing activities amounted to 33 million Euros in FY’24 essentially reflecting a net decrease in borrowings and related interest paid  as well as 8 million Euros dedicated to the implementation of a liquidity contract.In total  including a 3 million Euros negative impact of exchange rate fluctuations (6 million Euros positive impact in FY’23)  the net cash outflow reached 80 million Euros in FY’24 (compared to a cash generation of 60 million Euros in FY’23) leading to a cash position of 708 million Euros on March 31st  2024.Strong balance sheet maintainedSoitec maintained a strong balance sheet as of March 31st  2024.Shareholders’ equity increased by 189 million Euros in FY’24 to 1.5 billion Euros on March 31st  2024  mainly attributed to the net profit generated during the period.Financial debt stood at 747 million Euros on March 31st  2024. This represents a 99 million Euros increase compared to March 31st  2023  resulting from a net increase in leasing debt  including the arrangement of the first tranche of the lease secured for Bernin 4 for 59 million Euros and other lease agreements to finance production equipment for 51 million Euros.The combination of the 99 million Euros increase in financial debt and the 80 million Euros cash outflow led to a net debt position7 of 39 million Euros on March 31st  2024 compared to a net cash position7 of 140 million Euros on March 31st  2023 FY’25 outlook confirmedSoitec confirms expecting FY’25 revenue to be stable year on year at constant exchange rates and perimeter as compared to FY’24. However  as previously reported  the level of RF-SOI inventories at some foundries remains high  which will impact the first half of FY’25 performance. H1’25 revenue is expected to decline by around 15% year-on-year  at constant exchange rates and perimeter  with a low point expected in Q1’25. Soitec then anticipates revenue to rebound in the second half of FY’25  driven by the recovery of the RF-SOI activity following the end of the inventory correction. Besides  Soitec will continue to benefit from the strong structural demand for other SOI products  the continued adoption of POI and the start of the SmartSiCTM ramp-up.Soitec also confirms expecting FY’25 EBITDA1 margin2 to be around 35%.FY’25 Capital expenditure is expected to be around 250 million Euros in order to support growth beyond FY’25. The Group will continue to invest in capacity expansion: 300mm SOI in Singapore  POI ramp up and SmartSiCTM tools in France. The Group will also continue ongoing investments in innovation  sustainability as well as IT and cybersecurity investments.Soitec confidently foresees its long-term growth trajectory to resume rapidly after the end of the RF-SOI inventory correction. The strong penetration of 5G  the advent of electrification for automotive and the acceleration of artificial intelligence provide significant growth opportunities  thanks in particular to the successful expansion of Soitec’s product portfolio  both in SOI and Compound semiconductors.As a reminder  in line with what Soitec communicated in its March 27th 2024 press release  Soitec confirms that no more guidance will be given beyond yearly guidance.

While one of the vessels delivered into a higher rate charter  the other was off-hire for a handful of days before delivery and this  combined with lower rates on our single variable rate contract reduced our overall fleet TCE to $77 200 per day.Energy security concerns continue to support the price of LNG at above $9/MMBTU  which is supportive of shipping as average cargo values now exceed $30 million. Our next available vessels are well spaced and do not come open before the second half of 2024  when the market is anticipated to be in a seasonal upswing. Additionally  following two atypically warm winters in the northern hemisphere  during which China and India relied heavily upon significant coal inventories  we expect to see longer voyage distances in the second half of 2024 as greater volumes of LNG head east.Subsequent to the first quarter  CoolCo was pleased to announce a long-term charter for one of its two state-of-the-art Newbuilds and looks forward to securing employment for its second Newbuild. The 14-year long-term charter takes CoolCo’s firm revenue backlog to more than $1.2 billion and total revenue backlog including extensions to almost $1.9 billion as of March 31  2024  and underscores the significant gap between the prevailing spot market and the long-term employment prospects for the high-quality  fuel-efficient LNG carriers.""Financial HighlightsThe table below sets forth certain key financial information for Q1 2024  Q4 2023 and Q1 2023.(in thousands of $  except average daily TCE) Q1 2024 Q4 2023 Q1 2023 Time and voyage charter revenues 78 710 89 319 91 168 Total operating revenues 88 125 97 144 98 649 Operating income 44 097 55 051 52 022 Net income1 36 812 22 415 70 132 Adjusted EBITDA2 58 541 69 432 67 814 Average daily TCE2 (to the closest $100) 77 200 87 300 83 700LNG Market ReviewThe average Japan/Korea Marker gas price (""JKM"") for the Quarter was $9.43/MMBtu compared to $15.82/MMBtu for Q4 2023; with average JKM for Q2 2024 at $9.96/MMBtu as of May 14  2024. The Quarter commenced with Dutch Title Transfer Facility gas price (""TTF"") at $10.31/MMBtu and quoted TFDE headline spot rates of $78 750 per day. The Quarter concluded with TTF at $8.76/MMBtu and quoted TFDE headline spot rates of $39 500 per day. The TFDE headline spot rate has subsequently stabilized at around this level and is quoted at $39 000 per day as of May 14  2024.Most LNG has continued to trade within its basin of origin  reducing the number of long-distance inter-basin voyages and limiting the effect of the Panama and Suez Canal closures. While demand for gas in Europe has dropped  the price of LNG is supported by concerns over energy security and the potential for a further decrease in gas from Russia whether in gas or liquid form. The high value of the cargos delivered into Europe is supportive of LNG shipping even though the distances involved are shorter.The volatility of LNG markets is expected to increase as the winter heating season approaches. Onshore storage in Europe could fill up  resulting in more cargoes heading east and a return to using LNG carriers for storage – both of which would be positive for CoolCo’s vessels.Operational ReviewCoolCo's fleet continued to perform well with a Q1 fleet utilization of 95% compared to 97% for Q4 2023  with the difference primarily reflecting 51 off-hire days due to time lost between charterhire as Kool Husky transitioned to its new charter in early March. While there were no drydocks during Q1 2024  one drydock has commenced in the second quarter  with a further three vessels scheduled to start their drydocks during the third quarter of 2024. The average cost of these drydocks is estimated to be at approximately $6.5 million per vessel  plus up to 30 days off-hire. One of the drydocks scheduled for the third quarter will also include the upgrade of a vessel to LNGe specification through the retrofit of a sub-cooler with high liquefaction capacity and other performance enhancements at an estimated cost of an additional $15.0 million and an additional 20 days off-hire.Business DevelopmentThe chartering of one of CoolCo’s two Newbuilds sets a strong precedent for the second Newbuild and CoolCo continues to be in discussions with potential charterers regarding its employment. CoolCo is also developing leads for its other two vessels redelivering in the second half of 2024  both of which are earmarked for an upgrade to LNGe specification during their scheduled drydocks during the first half of 2025.Financing and LiquidityDuring the Quarter  the Company closed on the upsize of the existing $520 million term loan facility maturing in May 2029 in anticipation of the maturity of the two existing sale & leaseback facilities (Kool Ice and Kool Kelvin) during the first quarter of 2025. As previously disclosed  the $200 million upsize will be available on a delayed drawdown basis  at our option.As of March 31  2024  CoolCo had cash and cash equivalents of $105.8 million and total short and long-term debt  net of deferred finance charges  amounting to $1 042.6 million. In addition  CoolCo has approximately $49 million remaining undrawn capacity under its Newbuild Vessel pre-delivery facility. Total Contractual Debt2 stood at $1 145.9 million  which is comprised of $475.8 million in respect of the $570 million bank facility maturing in March 2027  $461.9 million in respect of the $520 million term loan facility maturing in May 2029  $168.2 million of sale and leaseback financing in respect of the two vessels maturing in the first quarter of 2025 (Kool Ice and Kool Kelvin) and $40.0 million in respect of the Newbuilds' financing (Kool Tiger and Kool Panther).In February 2024  lender approval was obtained for an amendment of financial covenants under the $570 million bank facility including a relaxation of the minimum cash covenant and a reduction in the minimum value clause. The new financial ratios include minimum net worth  maximum net debt to total assets and a minimum free cash restriction.In March 2024  the Company and a group of lenders under the $520 million term loan facility maturing in May 2029  signed an amendment for a $200 million upsize of this facility (on a delayed drawdown basis) in anticipation of the maturity of the two existing sale and leaseback facilities during the first quarter of 2025. The amendment also includes a reduction in minimum free cash restriction.Overall  the Company’s interest rate on its debt is currently fixed or hedged for approximately 80% of the notional amount of net debt  adjusting for existing cash on hand.Corporate and Other MattersAs of March 31  2024  CoolCo had 53 702 846 shares issued and outstanding. Of these  31 254 390 shares (58.2%) were owned by EPS Ventures Ltd (""EPS"") and 22 448 456 (41.8%) were owned by other public investors.In line with the Company’s variable dividend policy  the Board has declared a Q1 dividend of $0.41 per common share. The record date is May 31  2024 and the dividend will be distributed to DTC-registered shareholders on or around June 10  2024  while due to the implementation of the Central Securities Depositories Regulation in Norway  the dividend will be distributed to Euronext VPS-registered shareholders on or around June 13  2024.OutlookIn the near term  the spot LNG carrier market is likely to remain substantially detached from prospects for either multi-year secondhand employment or very long-term charters for newbuilds. Charterer comfort levels have been buoyed by two consecutive mild winters in the northern hemisphere and delays to commissioning and startup of very late-stage liquefaction facilities  resulting in both an enlarged pool of vessels available for short-term employment and an increased willingness of charterers to rely upon the availability of such temporary tonnage. As evidenced by the dislocation between the spot market and longer-term charter markets  current prevailing spot rates are more indicative of a market in a holding pattern than a longer-term call on overall market direction.As anticipated  the imposition of a carbon pricing scheme and increasingly stringent environmental regulations are increasingly disadvantaging older steam turbine vessels in mainstream LNG trades. As such  that portion of the fleet  representing approximately 30% of the global LNG carriers  is experiencing both increased idleness and reduced charter rates relative to more modern  fuel-efficient vessels. Additionally  as has been seen in other shipping sectors in recent years  an increasing number of older steam turbine vessels have begun transitioning out of mainstream trades via sales to owners based primarily in Asia. This phenomenon has served as a dampener on anticipated scrapping levels for those older  less efficient ships  but nevertheless removes them from direct competition for primary business in a way that is likely to be sticky.Moving beyond the short-term  liquefaction projects that have already reached FID (“Final Investment Decision”) remain set to increase the total volume of LNG on the water by more than 50% in the years ahead  with a particularly heavy concentration for commissioning in 2025  for which charterers will need to secure tonnage. Even against the backdrop of a sizable orderbook and relatively limited scrapping of older steam turbine vessels  the charter market is positioned to tighten considerably as these new volumes come online. Furthermore  even a typical winter season has the potential to absorb significant incremental tonnage. In that scenario  the prospect of being short transportation capacity is likely to reorient charterers away from their recent complacency in the spot market and back towards the risk-averse  energy security focus they have historically been willing to pay a premium for in the multi-year charter market.1 Net income for Q1 2024 includes a mark-to market gain on interest rate swaps amounting to $11.3 million  of which $8.1 million was unrealized gain. 2 Refer to 'Appendix A' - Non-GAAP financial measures and definitions  for definitions of these measures and a reconciliation to the nearest GAAP measure.Forward Looking StatementsThis press release and any other written or oral statements made by us in connection with this press release include forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (US GAAP)  this earnings release and the associated investor presentation and discussion contain references to the non-GAAP financial measures which are included in the table below. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business  enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance  and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business and measuring our performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for  or superior to  financial measures calculated in accordance with US GAAP  and the financial results calculated in accordance with US GAAP. Non-GAAP measures are not uniformly defined by all companies  and may not be comparable with similar titles  measures and disclosures used by other companies. The reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated.Non-GAAP measure Closest equivalentUS GAAP measure Adjustments to reconcile toprimary financial statementsprepared under US GAAP Rationale for adjustments Performance Measures Adjusted EBITDA Net income +/- Other non-operating income +/- Net financial expense  representing: Interest income  Interest expense  Gains/(Losses) on derivative instruments and Other financial items  net +/- Income taxes  net + Depreciation and amortization - Amortization of intangible assets and liabilities - charter agreements  net Increases the comparability of total business performance from period to period and against the performance of other companies by removing the impact of other non-operating income  depreciation  amortization of intangible assets and liabilities -charter agreements  net  financing and tax items.

Measure of the average daily net revenue performance of a vessel. Standard shipping industry performance measure used primarily to compare period-to-period changes in the vessel’s net revenue performance despite changes in the mix of charter types (i.e. spot charters  time charters and bareboat charters) under which the vessel may be employed between the periods. Assists management in making decisions regarding the deployment and utilization of its fleet and in evaluating financial performance. Liquidity measures Total Contractual Debt Total debt (current and non-current)  net of deferred finance charges + VIE Consolidation and fair value adjustments upon acquisition + Deferred Finance Charges We consolidate two lessor VIEs for our sale and leaseback facilities (for the vessels Ice and Kelvin). This means that on consolidation  our contractual debt is eliminated and replaced with the Lessor VIEs’ debt. Contractual debt represents our actual debt obligations under our various financing arrangements before consolidating the Lessor VIEs. The measure enables investors and users of our financial statements to assess our liquidity and the split of our debt (current and non-current) based on our underlying contractual obligations. Total Company Cash CoolCo cash based on GAAP measures: + Cash and cash equivalents + Restricted cash and short-term deposits (current and non-current) - VIE restricted cash and short-term deposits (current and non-current) We consolidate two lessor VIEs for our sale and leaseback facilities. This means that on consolidation  we include restricted cash held by the lessor VIEs. Total Company Cash represents our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and short-term deposits (current and non-current) before consolidating the lessor VIEs. Management believes that this measure enables investors and users of our financial statements to assess our liquidity and aids comparability with our competitors.Reconciliations - Performance MeasuresAdjusted EBITDA(in thousands of $) Jan-March2024 Oct-Dec2023 Jan-March2023 Net income 36 812 22 415 70 132 Other non-operating income — — (42 528 ) Interest income (1 705 ) (1 743 ) (1 517 ) Interest expense 19 678 20 463 19 485 (Gains)/Losses on derivative instruments (11 301 ) 13 115 6 001 Other financial items  net 480 426 393 Income taxes  net 133 375 56 Depreciation and amortization 18 936 18 898 19 897 Amortization of intangible assets and liabilities - charter agreements  net (4 492 ) (4 517 ) (4 105 ) Adjusted EBITDA 58 541 69 432 67 814Average daily TCE(in thousands of $  except number of days and average daily TCE) Jan-March2024 Oct-Dec2023 Jan-March2023 Time and voyage charter revenues 78 710 89 319 91 168 Voyage  charter hire and commission expenses  net (1 439 ) (1 019 ) (1 499 ) 77 271 88 300 89 669 Calendar days less scheduled off-hire days 1 001 1 012 1 071 Average daily TCE (to the closest $100) $ 77 200 $ 87 300 $ 83 700Reconciliations - Liquidity measuresTotal Contractual Debt(in thousands of $) At March 31 2024 At December 31 2023 Total debt (current and non-current) net of deferred finance charges 1 042 610 1 061 084 Add: VIE consolidation and fair value adjustments 98 184 97 245 Add: Deferred finance charges 5 083 5 563 Total Contractual Debt 1 145 877 1 163 892Total Company Cash(in thousands of $) At March 31 2024 At December 31  2023 Cash and cash equivalents 105 818 133 496 Restricted cash and short-term deposits 3 705 3 842 Less: VIE restricted cash (3 242 ) (3 350 ) Total Company Cash 106 281 133 988Other definitionsContracted Revenue BacklogContracted revenue backlog is defined as the contracted daily charter rate for each vessel multiplied by the number of scheduled hire days for the remaining contract term.

Q1 2024 Business Update By Investing.com,Cool Company Ltd. Q1 2024 Business Update,"LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--This release includes business updates and unaudited financial results for the three months ended March 31  2024 (""Q1""  ""Q1 2024"" or the ""Quarter"") of Cool Company Ltd. (""CoolCo"" or the ""Company"") (NYSE:CLCO / CLCO.OL).This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240521645435/en/Q1 Highlights and Subsequent EventsGenerated total operating revenues of $88.1 million in Q1  compared to $97.1 million for the fourth quarter of 2023 (""Q4"" or ""Q4 2023"") primarily related to brief off-hire on the Kool Husky as it transitioned to a new charter and a lower floating rate on another vessel;as it transitioned to a new charter and a lower floating rate on another vessel; Net income of $36.81 million in Q1  compared to $22.41 million for Q4 with the increase primarily related to unrealized mark-to-market gains on our interest rate swaps;Achieved average Time Charter Equivalent Earnings (""TCE"")2 of $77 200 per day for Q1  compared to $87 300 per day for Q4;Adjusted EBITDA2 of $58.5 million for Q1  compared to $69.4 million for Q4;Upsized the $520 million term loan facility by $200 million  pushing out the first debt maturity to February 2027;Secured a 14-year charter with GAIL (India) Limited during Q2 2024 for one of the two state-of-the-art MEGA LNG carriers currently under order at Hyundai-Samho (the ""Newbuilds"")  expected to be delivered towards the end of 2024;Commenced drydock cycle with one vessel during Q2 2024  with a further three vessels scheduled to follow in Q3 2024;Declared a quarterly dividend of $0.41 per share  payable to shareholders of record on May 31  2024.Richard Tyrrell  CEO  commented:The first quarter was a transitional quarter for both the market and CoolCo after the winter season in northern hemisphere ended early and two of CoolCo's vessels delivered into new charters. While one of the vessels delivered into a higher rate charter  the other was off-hire for a handful of days before delivery and this  combined with lower rates on our single variable rate contract reduced our overall fleet TCE to $77 200 per day.Energy security concerns continue to support the price of LNG at above $9/MMBTU  which is supportive of shipping as average cargo values now exceed $30 million. Our next available vessels are well spaced and do not come open before the second half of 2024  when the market is anticipated to be in a seasonal upswing. Additionally  following two atypically warm winters in the northern hemisphere  during which China and India relied heavily upon significant coal inventories  we expect to see longer voyage distances in the second half of 2024 as greater volumes of LNG head east.Subsequent to the first quarter  CoolCo was pleased to announce a long-term charter for one of its two state-of-the-art Newbuilds and looks forward to securing employment for its second Newbuild. The 14-year long-term charter takes CoolCo's firm revenue backlog to more than $1.2 billion and total revenue backlog including extensions to almost $1.9 billion as of March 31  2024  and underscores the significant gap between the prevailing spot market and the long-term employment prospects for the high-quality  fuel-efficient LNG carriers.""Financial HighlightsThe table below sets forth certain key financial information for Q1 2024  Q4 2023 and Q1 2023.(in thousands of $  except average daily TCE) Q1 2024 Q4 2023 Q1 2023 Time and voyage charter revenues 78 710 89 319 91 168 Total operating revenues 88 125 97 144 98 649 Operating income 44 097 55 051 52 022 Net income1 36 812 22 415 70 132 Adjusted EBITDA2 58 541 69 432 67 814 Average daily TCE2 (to the closest $100) 77 200 87 300 83 700LNG Market ReviewThe average Japan/Korea Marker gas price (""JKM"") for the Quarter was $9.43/MMBtu compared to $15.82/MMBtu for Q4 2023; with average JKM for Q2 2024 at $9.96/MMBtu as of May 14  2024. The Quarter commenced with Dutch Title Transfer Facility gas price (""TTF"") at $10.31/MMBtu and quoted TFDE headline spot rates of $78 750 per day. The Quarter concluded with TTF at $8.76/MMBtu and quoted TFDE headline spot rates of $39 500 per day. The TFDE headline spot rate has subsequently stabilized at around this level and is quoted at $39 000 per day as of May 14  2024.Most LNG has continued to trade within its basin of origin  reducing the number of long-distance inter-basin voyages and limiting the effect of the Panama and Suez Canal closures. While demand for gas in Europe has dropped  the price of LNG is supported by concerns over energy security and the potential for a further decrease in gas from Russia whether in gas or liquid form. The high value of the cargos delivered into Europe is supportive of LNG shipping even though the distances involved are shorter.The volatility of LNG markets is expected to increase as the winter heating season approaches. Onshore storage in Europe could fill up  resulting in more cargoes heading east and a return to using LNG carriers for storage “ both of which would be positive for CoolCo's vessels.Operational ReviewCoolCo's fleet continued to perform well with a Q1 fleet utilization of 95% compared to 97% for Q4 2023  with the difference primarily reflecting 51 off-hire days due to time lost between charterhire as Kool Husky transitioned to its new charter in early March. While there were no drydocks during Q1 2024  one drydock has commenced in the second quarter  with a further three vessels scheduled to start their drydocks during the third quarter of 2024. The average cost of these drydocks is estimated to be at approximately $6.5 million per vessel  plus up to 30 days off-hire. One of the drydocks scheduled for the third quarter will also include the upgrade of a vessel to LNGe specification through the retrofit of a sub-cooler with high liquefaction capacity and other performance enhancements at an estimated cost of an additional $15.0 million and an additional 20 days off-hire.Business DevelopmentThe chartering of one of CoolCo's two Newbuilds sets a strong precedent for the second Newbuild and CoolCo continues to be in discussions with potential charterers regarding its employment. CoolCo is also developing leads for its other two vessels redelivering in the second half of 2024  both of which are earmarked for an upgrade to LNGe specification during their scheduled drydocks during the first half of 2025.Financing and LiquidityDuring the Quarter  the Company closed on the upsize of the existing $520 million term loan facility maturing in May 2029 in anticipation of the maturity of the two existing sale & leaseback facilities (Kool Ice and Kool Kelvin) during the first quarter of 2025. As previously disclosed  the $200 million upsize will be available on a delayed drawdown basis  at our option.As of March 31  2024  CoolCo had cash and cash equivalents of $105.8 million and total short and long-term debt  net of deferred finance charges  amounting to $1 042.6 million. In addition  CoolCo has approximately $49 million remaining undrawn capacity under its Newbuild Vessel pre-delivery facility. Total Contractual Debt2 stood at $1 145.9 million  which is comprised of $475.8 million in respect of the $570 million bank facility maturing in March 2027  $461.9 million in respect of the $520 million term loan facility maturing in May 2029  $168.2 million of sale and leaseback financing in respect of the two vessels maturing in the first quarter of 2025 (Kool Ice and Kool Kelvin) and $40.0 million in respect of the Newbuilds' financing (Kool Tiger and Kool Panther).In February 2024  lender approval was obtained for an amendment of financial covenants under the $570 million bank facility including a relaxation of the minimum cash covenant and a reduction in the minimum value clause. The new financial ratios include minimum net worth  maximum net debt to total assets and a minimum free cash restriction.In March 2024  the Company and a group of lenders under the $520 million term loan facility maturing in May 2029  signed an amendment for a $200 million upsize of this facility (on a delayed drawdown basis) in anticipation of the maturity of the two existing sale and leaseback facilities during the first quarter of 2025. The amendment also includes a reduction in minimum free cash restriction.Overall  the Company's interest rate on its debt is currently fixed or hedged for approximately 80% of the notional amount of net debt  adjusting for existing cash on hand.Corporate and Other MattersAs of March 31  2024  CoolCo had 53 702 846 shares issued and outstanding. Of these  31 254 390 shares (58.2%) were owned by EPS Ventures Ltd (""EPS"") and 22 448 456 (41.8%) were owned by other public investors.In line with the Company's variable dividend policy  the Board has declared a Q1 dividend of $0.41 per common share. The record date is May 31  2024 and the dividend will be distributed to DTC-registered shareholders on or around June 10  2024  while due to the implementation of the Central Securities Depositories Regulation in Norway  the dividend will be distributed to Euronext VPS-registered shareholders on or around June 13  2024.OutlookIn the near term  the spot LNG carrier market is likely to remain substantially detached from prospects for either multi-year secondhand employment or very long-term charters for newbuilds. Charterer comfort levels have been buoyed by two consecutive mild winters in the northern hemisphere and delays to commissioning and startup of very late-stage liquefaction facilities  resulting in both an enlarged pool of vessels available for short-term employment and an increased willingness of charterers to rely upon the availability of such temporary tonnage. As evidenced by the dislocation between the spot market and longer-term charter markets  current prevailing spot rates are more indicative of a market in a holding pattern than a longer-term call on overall market direction.As anticipated  the imposition of a carbon pricing scheme and increasingly stringent environmental regulations are increasingly disadvantaging older steam turbine vessels in mainstream LNG trades. As such  that portion of the fleet  representing approximately 30% of the global LNG carriers  is experiencing both increased idleness and reduced charter rates relative to more modern  fuel-efficient vessels. Additionally  as has been seen in other shipping sectors in recent years  an increasing number of older steam turbine vessels have begun transitioning out of mainstream trades via sales to owners based primarily in Asia. This phenomenon has served as a dampener on anticipated scrapping levels for those older  less efficient ships  but nevertheless removes them from direct competition for primary business in a way that is likely to be sticky.Moving beyond the short-term  liquefaction projects that have already reached FID (Final Investment Decision) remain set to increase the total volume of LNG on the water by more than 50% in the years ahead  with a particularly heavy concentration for commissioning in 2025  for which charterers will need to secure tonnage. Even against the backdrop of a sizable orderbook and relatively limited scrapping of older steam turbine vessels  the charter market is positioned to tighten considerably as these new volumes come online. Furthermore  even a typical winter season has the potential to absorb significant incremental tonnage. In that scenario  the prospect of being short transportation capacity is likely to reorient charterers away from their recent complacency in the spot market and back towards the risk-averse  energy security focus they have historically been willing to pay a premium for in the multi-year charter market.1 Net income for Q1 2024 includes a mark-to market gain on interest rate swaps amounting to $11.3 million  of which $8.1 million was unrealized gain. 2 Refer to 'Appendix A' - Non-GAAP financial measures and definitions  for definitions of these measures and a reconciliation to the nearest GAAP measure.Forward Looking StatementsThis press release and any other written or oral statements made by us in connection with this press release include forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (US GAAP)  this earnings release and the associated investor presentation and discussion contain references to the non-GAAP financial measures which are included in the table below. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business  enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance  and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business and measuring our performance. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for  or superior to  financial measures calculated in accordance with US GAAP  and the financial results calculated in accordance with US GAAP. Non-GAAP measures are not uniformly defined by all companies  and may not be comparable with similar titles  measures and disclosures used by other companies. The reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated.Non-GAAP measure Closest equivalentUS GAAP measure Adjustments to reconcile toprimary financial statementsprepared under US GAAP Rationale for adjustments Performance Measures Adjusted EBITDA Net income +/- Other non-operating income +/- Net financial expense  representing: Interest income  Interest expense  Gains/(Losses) on derivative instruments and Other financial items  net +/- Income taxes  net + Depreciation and amortization - Amortization of intangible assets and liabilities - charter agreements  net Increases the comparability of total business performance from period to period and against the performance of other companies by removing the impact of other non-operating income  depreciation  amortization of intangible assets and liabilities -charter agreements  net  financing and tax items. Average daily TCE Time and voyage charter revenues - Voyage  charter hire and commission expenses  net The above total is then divided by calendar days less scheduled off-hire days. Measure of the average daily net revenue performance of a vessel. Standard shipping industry performance measure used primarily to compare period-to-period changes in the vessel's net revenue performance despite changes in the mix of charter types (i.e. spot charters  time charters and bareboat charters) under which the vessel may be employed between the periods. Assists management in making decisions regarding the deployment and utilization of its fleet and in evaluating financial performance. Liquidity measures Total Contractual Debt Total debt (current and non-current)  net of deferred finance charges + VIE Consolidation and fair value adjustments upon acquisition + Deferred Finance Charges We consolidate two lessor VIEs for our sale and leaseback facilities (for the vessels Ice and Kelvin). This means that on consolidation  our contractual debt is eliminated and replaced with the Lessor VIEs' debt. Contractual debt represents our actual debt obligations under our various financing arrangements before consolidating the Lessor VIEs. The measure enables investors and users of our financial statements to assess our liquidity and the split of our debt (current and non-current) based on our underlying contractual obligations. Total Company Cash CoolCo cash based on GAAP measures: + Cash and cash equivalents + Restricted cash and short-term deposits (current and non-current) - VIE restricted cash and short-term deposits (current and non-current) We consolidate two lessor VIEs for our sale and leaseback facilities. This means that on consolidation  we include restricted cash held by the lessor VIEs. Total Company Cash represents our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and short-term deposits (current and non-current) before consolidating the lessor VIEs. Management believes that this measure enables investors and users of our financial statements to assess our liquidity and aids comparability with our competitors.Reconciliations - Performance MeasuresAdjusted EBITDA(in thousands of $) Jan-March2024 Oct-Dec2023 Jan-March2023 Net income 36 812 22 415 70 132 Other non-operating income ” ” (42 528 ) Interest income (1 705 ) (1 743 ) (1 517 ) Interest expense 19 678 20 463 19 485 (Gains)/Losses on derivative instruments (11 301 ) 13 115 6 001 Other financial items  net 480 426 393 Income taxes  net 133 375 56 Depreciation and amortization 18 936 18 898 19 897 Amortization of intangible assets and liabilities - charter agreements  net (4 492 ) (4 517 ) (4 105 ) Adjusted EBITDA 58 541 69 432 67 814Average daily TCE(in thousands of $  except number of days and average daily TCE) Jan-March2024 Oct-Dec2023 Jan-March2023 Time and voyage charter revenues 78 710 89 319 91 168 Voyage  charter hire and commission expenses  net (1 439 ) (1 019 ) (1 499 ) 77 271 88 300 89 669 Calendar days less scheduled off-hire days 1 001 1 012 1 071 Average daily TCE (to the closest $100) $ 77 200 $ 87 300 $ 83 700Reconciliations - Liquidity measuresTotal Contractual Debt(in thousands of $) At March 31 2024 At December 31 2023 Total debt (current and non-current) net of deferred finance charges 1 042 610 1 061 084 Add: VIE consolidation and fair value adjustments 98 184 97 245 Add: Deferred finance charges 5 083 5 563 Total Contractual Debt 1 145 877 1 163 892Total Company Cash(in thousands of $) At March 31 2024 At December 31  2023 Cash and cash equivalents 105 818 133 496 Restricted cash and short-term deposits 3 705 3 842 Less: VIE restricted cash (3 242 ) (3 350 ) Total Company Cash 106 281 133 988Other definitionsContracted Revenue BacklogContracted revenue backlog is defined as the contracted daily charter rate for each vessel multiplied by the number of scheduled hire days for the remaining contract term.

This causes major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care  they become ineffective  intolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing ""diuretic-resistant"" patient population.Story continuesalfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  delivering major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients and reducing costs for healthcare systems.The Company’s Premarket Approval (PMA) application for the alfapump was submitted to the US FDA in December 2023 and accepted for substantive review in January 2024  having reported positive primary and secondary endpoint data from the North American pivotal POSEIDON study in recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis. US market approval of the alfapump is anticipated before the end of Q1 2025 with US commercial launch planned for H2 2025.Results of the Company's RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure support DSR's mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE  a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study  have been successfully treated with DSR  resulting in a dramatic improvement in diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements. The independent Data Safety Monitoring Board approved the start of the randomized MOJAVE cohort of up to a further 30 patients  which is planned after alfapump US PMA approval.Sequana Medical is listed on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent  Belgium. For further information  please visit www.sequanamedical.com .Important Regulatory DisclaimersThe alfapump® system is currently not approved in the United States or Canada. In the United States and Canada  the alfapump system is currently under clinical investigation (POSEIDON Trial) and is being studied in adult patients with refractory or recurrent ascites due to liver cirrhosis. DSR® therapy is still in development and it should be noted that any statements regarding safety and efficacy arise from ongoing pre-clinical and clinical investigations which have yet to be completed. There is no link between DSR therapy and ongoing investigations with the alfapump system in Europe  the United States or Canada.Note: alfapump® and DSR® are registered trademarks.Forward-looking statementsThis press release may contain predictions  estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking statements.

This causes major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care  they become ineffective  intolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing ""diuretic-resistant"" patient population.alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  delivering major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients and reducing costs for healthcare systems.The Company's Premarket Approval (PMA) application for the alfapump was submitted to the US FDA in December 2023 and accepted for substantive review in January 2024  having reported positive primary and secondary endpoint data from the North American pivotal POSEIDON study in recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis. US market approval of the alfapump is anticipated before the end of Q1 2025 with US commercial launch planned for H2 2025.Results of the Company's RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure support DSR's mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE  a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study  have been successfully treated with DSR  resulting in a dramatic improvement in diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements. The independent Data Safety Monitoring Board approved the start of the randomized MOJAVE cohort of up to a further 30 patients  which is planned after alfapump US PMA approval.Sequana Medical is listed on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels.Important Regulatory DisclaimersThe alfapump® system is currently not approved in the United States or Canada. In the United States and Canada  the alfapump system is currently under clinical investigation (POSEIDON Trial) and is being studied in adult patients with refractory or recurrent ascites due to liver cirrhosis. DSR® therapy is still in development and it should be noted that any statements regarding safety and efficacy arise from ongoing pre-clinical and clinical investigations which have yet to be completed. There is no link between DSR therapy and ongoing investigations with the alfapump system in Europe  the United States or Canada.Note: alfapump® and DSR® are registered trademarks.Forward-looking statementsThis press release may contain predictions  estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking statements.
