She added that the amount raised would help Ukraine not just through 2025 but further down the line.“Our hope would be to show that those assets do provide a viable stream of support in the years to come ” she told reporters ahead of meetings with her G-7 counterparts. “This is an assured source of financing and it’s important that Russia realize that we will not be deterred from supporting Ukraine for lack of resources.”Story continuesKey IssueItalian Finance Minister Giancarlo Giorgetti struck a similarly positive note  saying he is “optimistic” on this “key issue” and that the hope is to present the G-7 leaders with a plan.“The problem is what legal basis we have ” he told reporters. “It’s not simple  we’re working on it we need to be a bit creative. Currently legally the idea is to use the interest to repay the loans we give to Ukraine. The issue is we have to see if that’s feasible.”His German counterpart  Christian Lindner  also highlighted that “there are many unresolved issues  many unanswered questions here.”“Now is an opportunity to talk about it ” he said. “However  I don’t expect any decisions to be made  the matter is too complex for that  there are still far too many questions open.”The EU has separately already agreed to provide Ukraine twice a year with the profits from the frozen funds as they are generated. The US has been pushing to leverage those profits to be able to provide Kyiv with more money up front  with the future proceeds covering that outlay. The frozen assets are expected to raise about $5 billion a year.Should the G-7 come to an agreement  that accord would replace the EU initiative.An advantage of front-loading the proceeds from the assets would be to secure the benefit for Ukraine regardless of political uncertainty surrounding the presidential election in the US. Divisions in Washington have already made it difficult for President Joe Biden to extend more aid to Ukraine  and his challenger  former President Donald Trump  has expressed skepticism about support for the embattled country.Stumbling BlocksStill  officials caution that a lot of key details still need to be agreed given uncertainties surrounding the assets’ continued immobilization and the various technical aspects of this plan.Should the war come to an end and some kind of peace settlement is struck with Russia  with Moscow agreeing to pay for Ukraine’s reconstruction  that would raise questions over whether the assets would remain frozen and  if not  what guarantees would be provided for repaying the loan.Another uncertainty may stem from the fact that the EU has to renew its decision on keeping the assets immobilized every six months if the initiative is structured as a sanction  a procedure that would require unanimity. While unlikely  that raises the risk that a single EU nation could throw loan repayments into doubt by blocking a continued freeze.The European Central Bank and EU member states are also concerned about protecting Belgian-based Euroclear  which holds most of the assets  from any financial risk  for example from Russian lawsuits or possible retaliation from Moscow. Under the EU’s current initiative the clearing house retains the profits generated before Feb. 15 to cover those scenarios and a mechanism has been put in place to hold back more funds should the risks prove greater than anticipated.--With assistance from Alberto Nardelli  Jorge Valero  Alessandra Migliaccio  Kamil Kowalcze  Zoe Schneeweiss and Caroline Connan.(Updates with Giorgetti  Lindner starting in 11th paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek©2024 Bloomberg L.P.,neutral,0.05,0.74,0.22,mixed,0.13,0.29,0.59,True,English,"['Frozen Russian Assets', 'G-7 Closing', 'US-Led Push', 'Italian Finance Minister Giancarlo Giorgetti', 'US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen', 'former President Donald Trump', 'military offensive gaining ground', 'The European Central Bank', 'Russian central bank funds', 'President Joe Biden', 'various technical aspects', 'many unresolved issues', 'single EU nation', 'EU member states', 'many critical details', 'many unanswered questions', 'sustainable financial support', 'assets’ continued immobilization', 'Finance ministers', 'The US', 'military needs', 'many questions', 'The Group', 'Russian lawsuits', 'key details', 'continued freeze', 'US proposal', 'Russian assets', 'Seven countries', 'political shifts', 'future revenue', 'broad strokes', 'exact mechanism', 'participating parties', 'one thing', 'medium-term assistance', 'strong signal', 'viable stream', 'assured source', 'positive note', 'legal basis', 'German counterpart', 'Christian Lindner', 'presidential election', 'Stumbling Blocks', 'peace settlement', 'Belgian-based Euroclear', 'possible retaliation', 'critical financing', 'financial risk', 'Key Issue', 'US plan', 'G-7 governments', 'G-7 economies', 'G-7 allies', 'G-7 counterparts', 'massive loan', 'final decision', 'future proceeds', 'EU initiative', 'political uncertainty', 'loan repayments', 'G-7 leaders', 'frozen assets', 'Bloomberg', 'value', 'move', 'Ukraine', 'sides', 'Atlantic', 'Officials', 'discussions', 'Kyiv', 'matter', 'meeting', 'Stresa', 'Italy', 'aim', 'options', 'June', 'agreement', 'people', 'talks', 'size', 'amount', 'consensus', 'war', 'signs', 'abating', 'focus', 'Moscow', 'stake', 'defense', 'debt', 'money', 'reconstruction', 'line', 'hope', 'years', 'reporters', 'lack', 'resources', 'Story', 'problem', 'idea', 'interest', 'loans', 'opportunity', 'decisions', 'profits', 'outlay', 'accord', 'advantage', 'benefit', 'Divisions', 'Washington', 'aid', 'challenger', 'skepticism', 'country', 'lot', 'uncertainties', 'end', 'kind', 'guarantees', 'fact', 'sanction', 'procedure', 'unanimity', 'doubt', 'example']",2024-05-23,2024-05-24,finance.yahoo.com

Shareholders will receive one (1) subscription right for each share held on the record date  whereby three (3) subscription rights entitles to subscription of seventeen (17) new B-shares.

The subscription price is SEK 0.09 per new B-share  corresponding to total issue proceeds of up to SEK 312 442 117 before deduction of transaction costs related to the Rights Issue  assuming that the Rights Issue is fully subscribed.In the event that not all B-shares are subscribed for by exercising subscription rights  the Company’s Board of Directors shall  within the maximum amount of the Rights Issue  decide on the allotment of B-shares subscribed for without subscription rights. In such cases  allotment of new B-shares shall be carried out in accordance with the following:Firstly  allotment of B-shares shall be granted to those who have subscribed for B-shares by exercising subscription rights  regardless if the subscriber were registered as shareholder on the record date on 30 May 2024 or not and  in the event of over-subscription  pro rata in relation to their subscription by exercising subscription rights  and  to the extent this is not possible  by drawing lots.Secondly  allotment of B-shares shall be granted to others who have subscribed for B-shares without exercising subscription rights  and in the event of over-subscription  pro rata in relation to the subscribed amount  and to the extent this is not possible  by drawing lots.Thirdly  allotment of B-shares  that does not constitute FDI Shares (as defined below)  shall as applicable be granted to a party who have guaranteed part of the Rights Issue with allotment before other guarantors in accordance with separate agreement with the Company (“Primary Subscription Guarantee”).Fourthly  allotment of B-shares  that does not constitute FDI Shares (as defined below)  shall as applicable be granted to the parties who  subordinated to the Primary Subscription Guarantee  guarantees part of the Rights Issue  pro rata in relation to such guarantee commitments in accordance with separate agreement with the Company.Ultimately  as applicable  allotment of B-shares that constitutes FDI Shares (as defined below) shall be granted to the relevant party who guarantees part of the Rights Issue if and when that guarantor has obtained a positive FDI Decision (as defined below).Allotment of B-shares in the Rights Issue that would entail that a party who guarantees part of the Rights Issue gains control of ten (10) per cent or more of the votes in the Company following the Rights Issue requires a prior decision from the Inspectorate of Strategic Products (“ISP”) in accordance with the Screening of Foreign Direct Investment Act (the “Swedish FDI Act”) (Sw. lag (2023:560) om granskning av utländska direktinvesteringar)  and  if applicable  any other equivalent body pursuant to legislation in any other jurisdiction  to approve the investment or leave the application therefore without remark (“FDI Decision”). Such B-shares in the Rights Issue which  if granted to a party who guarantees part of the Right Issue  would require a FDI Decision and such FDI Decision has not been obtained at the time of granting are referred to as “FDI Shares”.Some of the Company’s shareholders (including members of the Board of Directors and executive management) have undertaken to subscribe for new B-shares for a total amount of approximately SEK 1.5 million in the Rights Issue. Furthermore  in a display of continued support of the Company  an entity managed by Heights Capital Management  Inc. (“HCM”) have entered into a guarantee commitment consisting of a so-called top guarantee in an amount of up to SEK 50 million and  subordinated to HCM’s top guarantee  a so-called bottom guarantee in an amount of up to SEK 100 million. In addition  certain other external investors have  subordinated to HCM’s top guarantee  entered into bottom guarantee commitments which together with HCM’s bottom guarantee amounts to up to approximately SEK 225 million. If the Rights Issue is subscribed and paid for in an amount between SEK 225 million and SEK 275 million  the top guarantee covers the subscription and payment of B-shares in the Rights Issue up to SEK 275 million and if the Rights Issue is subscribed and paid for in an amount under SEK 225 million  the bottom guarantees covers the subscription of and payment for B-shares in the Rights Issue up to SEK 225 million. No guarantee commitment covers the subscription of and payment for B-shares in the Rights Issue in excess of SEK 275 million. Accordingly  the Rights Issue is covered by subscription undertakings and guarantee commitments in an aggregate amount of up to SEK 275 million.The record date for determining which shareholders are entitled to subscribe for new B-shares is 30 May 2024. The B-shares are traded including right to participate in the Rights Issue up to and including 28 May 2024. The subscription period is expected to run from and including 3 June 2024 up to and including 17 June 2024. In the event that any guarantee commitment will require the subscription and payment of FDI Shares  there will be a separate and longer subscription and payment period in respect of such FDI Shares which may run up until 31 August 2024. Trading in subscription rights is expected to take place on Nasdaq Stockholm from and including 3 June 2024 up to and including 12 June 2024  and trading in paid subscribed B-shares (Sw. betald tecknad aktie “BTA”) is expected to occur from and including 3 June 2024 up to and including 27 June 2024.The Company’s Board of Directors will apply for admission to trading of the new B-shares on Nasdaq Stockholm. First day of trading is expected to occur on or about 3 July 2024.Shareholders not participating in the Rights Issue will be subject to a dilutive effect corresponding to approximately 85.0 percent of the number of shares and approximately 83.6 percent of the number of votes upon full subscription in the Rights Issue. However  the shareholders have the possibility to fully or partly compensate themselves financially for this dilutive effect by selling their subscription rights.Further and as announced by way of press release on 26 April 2024  the Swedish Securities Council (Sw. Aktiemarknadsnämnden) granted one of the external guarantors  HCM  an exemption from the mandatory bid obligations under the Swedish Act on Public Takeovers on the Stock Market (Sw. lagen (2006:451) om offentliga uppköpserbjudanden på aktiemarknaden). The exemption is however conditional upon that (i) the Company’s shareholders prior to the annual general meeting  are informed about the total holding of shares and votes that HCM may receive as a result of its guarantee commitment (if fully utilised) and (ii) the Rights Issue is approved by the annual general meeting with at least two thirds of both the votes cast and shares represented at the meeting  excluding any shares held and represented by HCM. Against the above and in accordance with the final terms of the Rights Issue  HCM may receive a total of 1 666 666 666 shares and votes in Fingerprints if their guarantee commitment is fully utilised  which if the Rights Issue is fully subscribed corresponds to 40.8 percent of the number of shares in the Company and 40.1 percent of the number of votes in the Company following the completion of the Rights Issue.1The Rights Issue is subject to the approval by the annual general meeting to be held on 28 May 2024.

In France it involves picking a yearly cohort of 120 high-potential startups — the French Tech 120 — including 40 private companies deemed as most promising  dubbed the Next40.The French secretary of state for Digital Affairs  as of this year  Marina Ferrari  revealed this year’s laureates during VivaTech week in Paris. According to its promoters  this fifth class was the most selective since the inception of the program.The French Tech Next40/120 program launched in 2019  and lessons have been learned along the way  especially when some unicorns turned out to be ZIRPicorns. Following recommendations from tech insiders  criteria have changed  and half of the selection is now based on revenue metrics  rather than fundraising.As a result  only 28 of the French Tech 120 selected in 2024 claim valuations of $1 billion or more. On the other hand  La French Tech reports that the cohort collectively had a net revenue of €10 billion in 2023  compared with €7.5 billion in 2022. Thirty-one companies reported a net revenue above €100 million.In aggregate  this cohort reveals or confirms some interesting trends that France is riding  such as the rise of deep tech and AI. But it is also worth zooming in on new laureates of the Next40: If and when the IPO window reopens  the expectation would be for some of these to go public and reinject long-awaited liquidity into the venture capital pipeline.Without further ado  here’s the class of 2024  summed up in one image:Image Credits: French Tech Next40/120That’s not the most digestible format  so let’s take a closer look at newcomers.Welcome to the club(s)Here are some of the companies that joined the Next40 list:It is impressive  in particular  to see how fast Mistral AI joined the same list as two-decade-old Weezevent. The AI company only recently turned one  but Arthur Mensch and his co-founders are now at the helm of one of France’s most promising companies  and perhaps eventually a publicly listed one.While that’s somewhat implied by the “Next40” moniker alluding to France’s CAC 40  it is too early to tell which of these will turn into IPO candidates and when or where. In 2023  Euronext only welcomed 64 new listings  down from 83 in 2022 and 212 in 2021.Among the other 80 companies that complete the FrenchTech 120  new entrants are Adagio  AQEMIA  Braincube  Comet  DriiveMe  Ekimetrics  Exotrail  Flowdesk  Foodles  Greenly  HappyVore  Hoppen  iSupplier  La Fourche  Madbox  Moon Surgical  Mooncard  mylight150  Opteamis  Pasqal  PerfectStay  Planity  Shares  SiPearl  Swan  Umiami  Unseenlabs  Volta Medical  WAAT  WeMaintain and Worldia.To our knowledge  none of these startups is a unicorn (yet). Then again  maybe that should never have been the North Star. Regardless  it would have been a tough goal to achieve in recent months: Investment into French startups declined significantly last year  from €13.49 billion in 2022 to €8.32 billion. According to EY  green tech was the largest cohort with €2.7 billion in funding  and is also well represented in the French Tech 120.Reflecting trendsThe French Tech 120 come from a variety of sectors  from fintech to space tech  but there are clear trends at play.A caveat  though: For the first time  applicants were asked to respect commitments in terms of gender equality and ecological transition. The latter could have given a bit more weight to green tech companies  which represent 30% of the 2024 class  but that’s also roughly in line with the share of investment they attracted last year.AI is another sector in which French startups attracted mega-rounds  even at the seed stage. There’s something going on with AI startups in France  and the French government wants to support this. The French Tech Next40/120 reflects that trend with the inclusion of Mistral AI  but also pharmatech AQEMIA and quantum computing startup Pasqal.Beyond AI  it’s deep tech that comes up as a heavyweight on the list  accounting for 23% of the 120 companies. Again  that’s no surprise: We already reported that deep tech was on the rise in Europe  with tailwinds from public funding.The French Tech Next40/120 program also comes with perks. There’s no direct funding involved; the main benefit is the promise of less friction and fewer “unnecessary institutional obstacles.” It is quite telling that this is touted as a largess  and presumably  more companies could benefit from that. But if you want to have global champions  you have to start somewhere.The French Tech Next40/120 already crossed borders: 88% of companies in the new class have a physical presence or significant commercial activity abroad in 2024.Being selected will give them more international visibility  but it’s at home that it will more directly open doors: Since 2023  an initiative called “Je Choisis la French Tech” encourages public administrations and large corporations to procure solutions from French startups. Now that markets care more about profitability  this is much more tangible than a unicorn horn.,neutral,0.07,0.92,0.01,mixed,0.49,0.26,0.25,True,English,"['biggest French startups', 'French government', 'The French Tech Next40/120 program', 'fewer “unnecessary institutional obstacles', 'quantum computing startup Pasqal', 'many ways countries', 'venture capital pipeline', 'significant commercial activity', 'The AI company', 'La French Tech', 'green tech companies', 'French secretary', 'French government', 'tech industries', 'tech insiders', 'deep tech', 'space tech', 'La Fourche', 'French startups', 'Digital Affairs', 'Marina Ferrari', 'VivaTech week', 'revenue metrics', '2024 claim valuations', 'other hand', 'net revenue', 'interesting trends', 'IPO window', 'one image', 'Image Credits', 'digestible format', 'closer look', 'two-decade-old Weezevent', 'Arthur Mensch', 'IPO candidates', '64 new listings', 'new entrants', 'Moon Surgical', 'Volta Medical', 'North Star', 'tough goal', 'recent months', 'Reflecting trends', 'clear trends', 'first time', 'gender equality', 'ecological transition', 'seed stage', 'main benefit', 'less friction', 'global champions', 'physical presence', 'international visibility', 'public administrations', 'large corporations', '120 high-potential startups', 'Mistral AI', '40 private companies', 'Thirty-one companies', 'same list', 'promising companies', 'Next40” moniker', 'other 80 companies', 'public funding', 'direct funding', 'AI startups', 'yearly cohort', 'fifth class', 'new laureates', 'largest cohort', 'pharmatech AQEMIA', 'new class', 'Next40 list', '120 companies', '2024 class', 'France', 'state', 'Paris', 'promoters', 'inception', 'lessons', 'unicorns', 'ZIRPicorns', 'recommendations', 'criteria', 'half', 'selection', 'fundraising', 'result', 'aggregate', 'rise', 'expectation', 'liquidity', 'ado', 'newcomers', 'Welcome', 'club', 'founders', 'helm', 'CAC', 'Euronext', 'FrenchTech', 'Adagio', 'Braincube', 'Comet', 'DriiveMe', 'Ekimetrics', 'Exotrail', 'Flowdesk', 'Foodles', 'Greenly', 'HappyVore', 'Hoppen', 'iSupplier', 'Madbox', 'Mooncard', 'mylight150', 'Opteamis', 'PerfectStay', 'Planity', 'Shares', 'SiPearl', 'Swan', 'Umiami', 'Unseenlabs', 'WAAT', 'WeMaintain', 'Worldia', 'knowledge', 'none', 'Investment', 'EY', 'variety', 'sectors', 'fintech', 'play', 'caveat', 'applicants', 'commitments', 'terms', 'weight', 'mega-rounds', 'something', 'inclusion', 'Europe', 'tailwinds', 'perks', 'promise', 'largess', 'borders', 'home', 'doors', 'initiative', 'solutions', 'markets', 'profitability']",2024-05-23,2024-05-24,techcrunch.com

With a market capitalization of $259.86 million  Nyxoah is positioning itself to leverage the proceeds from this offering to further its commercial and developmental ambitions.An InvestingPro Tip highlights that analysts are anticipating sales growth in the current year  which aligns with the company's aggressive commercialization plans in the U.S. This optimism is further supported by the substantial revenue growth Nyxoah has experienced over the last twelve months  with a notable increase of 78.99%. This figure suggests a strong upward trajectory in the company's sales performance  potentially enhancing investor confidence.On the flip side  another InvestingPro Tip indicates that analysts do not expect the company to be profitable this year  which is corroborated by a negative P/E ratio of -6.44. This metric may raise caution among investors  as it reflects the company's current lack of profitability. Moreover  the cash burn concern is substantiated by the company's operating income margin at -895.46%  highlighting the significant expenses incurred in relation to its revenue.Still  the company's liquid assets surpassing short-term obligations suggest a degree of financial stability that could reassure investors of its ability to meet immediate financial commitments.

In addition  its solid expertise of bank debt will prove valuable for turning Atos around – a venture Jean-Louis Bouchard intends to proceed with immediately  providing the conditions are met.A BOUT ECONOCOMThe Econocom Group  created 50 years ago  is a pioneer in supporting the digital transformation of companies.

(Euronext: ONWD)  a medical technology company creating innovative spinal cord stimulation therapies to restore movement  function  and independence in people with spinal cord injury (SCI)  today provided a Q1 2024 business update.“This week’s publication of Up-LIFT pivotal trial results in Nature Medicine underscores the tremendous potential of ARC-EX Therapy to restore independence in daily activities for people with spinal cord injury ” said Dave Marver  CEO of ONWARD Medical. “We are working closely with the FDA toward clearance for the ARC-EX System and we are preparing to introduce this technology to the SCI Community in the US later this year.”Q1 and Year-To-Date Highlights:Clinical and DevelopmentIn January 2024  the Company expanded its HemON clinical feasibility study to explore use of the ARC-IM System to improve blood pressure regulation after SCI with the addition of Sint Maartenskliniek in the Netherlands. This additional research site prepares the Company for expected Q4 2024 initiation of a global pivotal trial called Empower BP to assess the safety and efficacy of ARC-IM Therapy to improve blood pressure regulation.In February 2023  the Company announced it has been awarded Breakthrough Device Designation (BDD) by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the ARC-BCI™ System  which uses brain-computer interface (BCI) technology in conjunction with its ARC-IM Therapy to restore thought-driven lower limb mobility after spinal cord injury (SCI). This is the Company’s tenth BDD.In March 2024  ONWARD Medical was only the second BCI company admitted into the FDA’s new Total Product Lifecycle Advisory Program (TAP).In April 2024  the Company announced it had submitted a De Novo application to the US FDA to obtain regulatory clearance to begin marketing its non-invasive ARC-EX System in the United States. Clearance is expected Q4 2024.In May 2024  the Company announced the publication of global Up-LIFT pivotal trial results in Nature Medicine. The study achieved all primary and secondary safety and effectiveness endpoints  and ARC-EX Therapy demonstrated significant improvements in upper limb strength  function  and sensation among people with chronic tetraplegia due to cervical SCI.Intellectual PropertyThe Company was issued 13 new patents during Q1 2024  bringing its total number of issued patents year-to-date to more than 265  further strengthening its first-mover advantage.Corporate and FinancialIn March 2024  the Company completed a EUR 20M equity financing that strengthened its cash position to support investments in product development  clinical trials  operational and commercial capabilities; this financing extended the Company’s cash runway through mid-2025.The Company reported cash and cash equivalents of EUR 42 million as of March 31  2024.Outlook:ONWARD Medical expects steady and consistent execution to continue throughout 2024 with planned achievement of the following target milestones:The Company expects FDA clearance and first commercial sale in the US for its ARC-EX System sometime in Q4 2024. European regulatory approval and commercialization are expected sometime in 2025.The Company continues to prepare for its Empower BP global pivotal trial to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of its implantable ARC-IM System to address blood pressure instability after SCI. It expects IDE approval from FDA in Q4 2024 to commence this study. First participant enrollment could occur in late 2024 or early 2025. The Company also expects publication of interim results from clinical feasibility studies for this indication in a leading scientific journal sometime in 2H 2024.The Company expects to gain additional clinical data and experience with its implantable ARC-IM System in 2024  with several implants planned with support from the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson’s Research as well as several more planned in combination with an investigational brain-computer interface (BCI) with support from the European Innovation Council.The Company reaffirmed its expected cash runway through mid-2025 and will opportunistically evaluate measures to further strengthen its balance sheet in the coming months.Conference Call & WebcastONWARD Medical will host a conference call with a live webcast today  May 23  2024  at 2:30 pm CET / 8:30 am ET.

This large-scale project confirms Séché's world-renowned expertise in environmental services.Séché Environnement will be in charge of this worksite  which is expected to last about 3 years and will constitute the final stage in the remediation of the land.The site has hydrocarbon soil pollution located mainly between 5 and 8 meters deep  linked to the area’s industrial past and in particular to the presence of previous oil activities.Séché Environnement will deploy its remediation expertise  implementing a comprehensive environmental management plan that will include excavation  analysis and treatment of the impacted soils. This project meets the most stringent environmental standards and is part of a circular economy approach  aiming to treat and then reuse all regenerated soil on site.Ricardo Labarca  Las Salinas Development Director  stressed that “the choice of Séché Environnement  a recognized partner  to lead this major project marks a new milestone in the work begun over 20 years ago now to revitalize this area emblematic of Viña del Mar’s industrial past. Our environmental and social commitment to the city drives us to continue our efforts to revitalize these lands and develop a project offering the best opportunities for the entire community “.“We are very honored to have been chosen by Las Salinas for this far-reaching project ” said Maxime Séché  Chief Executive Officer of Séché Environnement. “We look forward to applying our expertise and commitment to environmental excellence to help revitalize Las Salinas and create a safe and sustainable urban environment for future generations.”Implanted in Chile since 2017  the Group confirms here its international expertise in the field of depollution and remediation services.Proven expertiseIn France  the company is currently working on the decontamination of 11 hectares in the town center of Frontignan  impacted by the activity of a former refinery. The project involves multiple challenges  given its location in a densely populated urban area close to the coast  and the need to control pyrotechnic risks  linked to the site’s history as a target for bombing during the Second World War. This worksite  which will last more than three years  will enable the city to reclaim land to develop a new district  thus meeting the objectives of zero net artificialization.Séché Environnement was also involved in the clean-up of the 12-hectares site of the newly inaugurated Olympic Aquatic Center on the outskirts of Paris. Once a gas factory  the challenge was unprecedented  given the timeframe  location  size and complexity of the decontamination to be carried out  as well as the circular economy issues involved. Inaugurated last April  the Aquatic Center will host some of the events of the Paris 2024 Olympic Games.About Séché EnvironnementSéché Environnement is a leading player in waste management  including the most complex and hazardous waste  and in environmental services  particularly in the event of an environmental emergency.Thanks to its expertise in the creation of circular economy loops  decarbonization and hazard control  the group has been contributing to the ecological transition of industries and territories  as well as to the protection of the living world  for nearly 40 years. A French family-owned industrial group  Séché Environnement deploys the cutting-edge technologies developed by its R&D department at the heart of territories  in more than 120 locations in 15 countries  including some fifty industrial sites in France. With more than 6 000 employees  including 2 500 in France  Séché Environnement generated a turnover of €1 013 5 million in 2023  26% of which was generated internationally.Séché Environnement is listed on Eurolist by Euronext (compartment B).

The innovative Identity system is built upon Thales’ end-to-end solution  covering the process from citizens’ enrolment to physical and digital identity issuance  and prioritises a comprehensive approach to global security. Mauritius will become the first African country to implement a fully interoperable digital ID wallet  based on international ISO standards.The Mauritius Prime Minister's Office (PMO) has entrusted the consortium led by Thales  which includes the leading Mauritian-grown IT provider Harel Mallac Technologies (HMT)  with a crucial step toward developing a comprehensive National ID system to improve citizen services and bolstering identity security. This partnership sets the foundations for the next generation digital journey of Mauritius  fully aligned with the country’s 2030 digital strategy.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240523106005/en/©ThalesThis ambitious modernisation effort draws on Thales experience from 300 government projects worldwide  and ensures that field-proven technology can be associated for timely delivery and reliable project execution. It is a long-term partnership providing consistent and expert support in all key components of the identity scheme  from citizen enrolment to physical and digital ID issuance. This end-to-end approach effectively meets future evolutions as well as potential identity threats.As part of the 10-year contract Thales is providing a powerful and modular Identity Management System to securely issue cutting-edge eID cards and its mobile companion  the Digital ID Wallet. The solution assures comprehensive trust and privacy in daily interactions between public entities and individuals. The user experience is at the core of this modernisation drive  illustrated by the wider range of new functionalities and services it brings to citizens.The citizen’s journey starts with a frictionless enrolment process  which can be initiated online from the comfort of home to save citizens time when visiting the enrolment centre. Once enrolled  the holder will receive a new eID card which relies on the latest Thales embedded software and advanced security features  including high resolution colour photo1  to effectively combat forgery and identity theft. For more convenience  self-service kiosks will be installed at dedicated spots to enable users to update their ID cards’ information (with new address  etc) and manage the PIN code associated with the digital certificates stored in their card.Citizens can also activate their Digital ID Wallet  a secure mobile application where they can securely store and share digital identity documents. The wallet will initially include digital versions of the identity card and will subsequently contain other official documents such as birth and marriage certificates. These may then be shared both online and in-person. Citizens will also be able to digitally sign documents with a one-time certificate as well as log in to online government services by using their digital wallet. For service providers (public administrations  banks  retailers  universities  etc…) it will be a simpler and more secure way to verify identities. Citizens’ control over their personal data is guaranteed thanks to stringent data privacy and consent management mechanisms.Mauritius identity cards production will benefit from Thales factories’ sustainability action plan  which aims to reduce the carbon footprint by utilising 100% renewable electricity  optimising energy consumption and minimising waste. As a complement to this approach  the Mauritius project is part of Thales' offsetting program which supports sustainable initiatives2 worldwide (selected in collaboration with Climate Impact Partner) by offsetting the carbon emissions from all its travel and ID solutions.During the official launching on 26th February 2024 of the national ID card at the Sir Harilal Vaghjee Memorial Hall  Government Centre  Port Louis  it was stated that:“The purpose of modernising the present system with sophisticated and next generation technology is to enable new services while increasing citizen security and convenience. The next-generation ID system will lay the foundation for supporting the country's digital transformation  benefiting all stakeholders and fostering economic growth.”“With this implementation  blending ID cards and digital identity  Mauritius fully leverages the best of both worlds  offering the optimal combination of security and ease ” says Youzec Kurp  VP Identity and Biometrics Solutions at Thales. “The new Mauritius ID system stands as one of the most advanced and marks the first implementation of a fully interoperable Digital ID Wallet in Africa  adhering to international ISO standards. This positions Mauritius amongst the pioneer countries in identity solutions worldwide.”1 The new e-document incorporates latest generation of embedded software together with advanced physical features such as Thales Colour Laser Shield technology (high resolution colour portrait) ensuring state-of-the-art protection against counterfeiting for both blank and personalised documents  True Vision (high resolution true-colour UV picture)  transparent window element with the holders’ ghost image  and Secure Surface 3D tactile features combining movement and light reflection.2 Example of supported projects in 2023: Vichada Afforestation in Colombia  Aqua Clara Water Filters in Kenya  Renewable Energy Portfolio worldwide.About ThalesThales (Euronext Paris: HO) is a global leader in advanced technologies specialized in three business domains: Defence & Security  Aeronautics & Space  and Cybersecurity & Digital identity.It develops products and solutions that help make the world safer  greener and more inclusive.The Group invests close to €4 billion a year in Research & Development  particularly in key innovation areas such as AI  cybersecurity  quantum technologies  cloud technologies and 6G.Thales has close to 81 000* employees in 68 countries.

This large-scale project confirms SÃ©chÃ©'s world-renowned expertise in environmental services.SÃ©chÃ© Environnement will be in charge of this worksite  which is expected to last about 3 years and will constitute the final stage in the remediation of the land.The site has hydrocarbon soil pollution located mainly between 5 and 8 meters deep  linked to the area's industrial past and in particular to the presence of previous oil activities.SÃ©chÃ© Environnement will deploy its remediation expertise  implementing a comprehensive environmental management plan that will include excavation  analysis and treatment of the impacted soils. This project meets the most stringent environmental standards and is part of a circular economy approach  aiming to treat and then reuse all regenerated soil on site.Ricardo Labarca  Las Salinas Development Director  stressed that the choice of SÃ©chÃ© Environnement  a recognized partner  to lead this major project marks a new milestone in the work begun over 20 years ago now to revitalize this area emblematic of ViÃ±a del Mar's industrial past. Our environmental and social commitment to the city drives us to continue our efforts to revitalize these lands and develop a project offering the best opportunities for the entire community .We are very honored to have been chosen by Las Salinas for this far-reaching project  said Maxime SÃ©chÃ©  Chief Executive Officer of SÃ©chÃ© Environnement. We look forward to applying our expertise and commitment to environmental excellence to help revitalize Las Salinas and create a safe and sustainable urban environment for future generations.Implanted in Chile since 2017  the Group confirms here its international expertise in the field of depollution and remediation services.Proven expertiseIn France  the company is currently working on the decontamination of 11 hectares in the town center of Frontignan  impacted by the activity of a former refinery. The project involves multiple challenges  given its location in a densely populated urban area close to the coast  and the need to control pyrotechnic risks  linked to the site's history as a target for bombing during the Second World War. This worksite  which will last more than three years  will enable the city to reclaim land to develop a new district  thus meeting the objectives of zero net artificialization.SÃ©chÃ© Environnement was also involved in the clean-up of the 12-hectares site of the newly inaugurated Olympic Aquatic Center on the outskirts of Paris. Once a gas factory  the challenge was unprecedented  given the timeframe  location  size and complexity of the decontamination to be carried out  as well as the circular economy issues involved. Inaugurated last April  the Aquatic Center will host some of the events of the Paris 2024 Olympic Games.About SÃ©chÃ© EnvironnementSÃ©chÃ© Environnement is a leading player in waste management  including the most complex and hazardous waste  and in environmental services  particularly in the event of an environmental emergency.Thanks to its expertise in the creation of circular economy loops  decarbonization and hazard control  the group has been contributing to the ecological transition of industries and territories  as well as to the protection of the living world  for nearly 40 years. A French family-owned industrial group  SÃ©chÃ© Environnement deploys the cutting-edge technologies developed by its R&D department at the heart of territories  in more than 120 locations in 15 countries  including some fifty industrial sites in France. With more than 6 000 employees  including 2 500 in France  SÃ©chÃ© Environnement generated a turnover of €1 013 5 million in 2023  26% of which was generated internationally.SÃ©chÃ© Environnement is listed on Eurolist by Euronext (compartment B).

Using Nokia's Network as Code platform with developer portal  developers will be able to test and take advantage of Orange's 5G network capabilities to create applications for customers in France and other parts of Europe.Orange  one of Europe's leading telecommunications providers with more than 280 million mobile subscribers  is already providing commercial production grade network API capabilities to developers using the Orange Developer Portal.Orange aims to accelerate and further tap into the global ecosystem of developers and unlock 5G network capabilities such as dynamic bandwidth allocation  real-time location insights  predictive maintenance  and event-driven triggers for security and safety responses.To make that happen  Nokia's Network as Code platform with developer portal will provide application developers with access to Software Development Kits (SDK); Network API documentation  a 'sandbox' to create software code for use case simulation and testing; and code 'snippets' that can be included in new applications in addition to Orange Developer Portal.As a result of this expanded partnership  an extension of Orange and Nokia's long-standing relationship  developers will have the tools to leverage Orange's network features  develop new use cases  and create new value for developer and Orange customers.As part of the first step in their network API collaboration  Orange and Nokia will co-host a ""Network as Code Hackathon"" on May 23-24 at France's premier tech start-up conference  Viva Tech. This hackathon will provide a forum for developers to build new  innovative use cases and applications using Nokia's Network as Code platform with developer portal.Going forward  as part of the expanded partnership  Orange and Nokia will further engage with the developer community by enabling pre-commercial use case support while leveraging network API expertise and network capabilities provided by both partners. This pilot program will become available progressively in select European countries at first by leveraging Orange 5G Labs network.Nokia's Network as Code platform with developer portal brings together telco networks  systems integrators  and software developers from around the world into a unified ecosystem to accelerate the development of software applications that can harness the untapped capabilities of 5G and 4G networks.The platform uses technical standards produced through industry initiatives such as the GSMA Open Gateway initiative and the Linux Foundation CAMARA. Nokia and Orange contribute to both initiatives. Orange has already implemented Linux Foundation CAMARA's guidelines and first commercial grade APIs are available in France and Spain.Nokia has signed collaboration agreements with 12 network operators and ecosystem partners around the world to use its Network as Code platform with developer portal.Laurent Leboucher  Group CTO at Orange  said: ""We are very pleased to open another area of collaboration with Nokia that enables compelling business use cases to consume our network assets in ways that were not really feasible years ago. Today  the level of collaboration among operators  system integrators  developers  and partners  is a step change and this is positioning us to better tap the cloud-native capabilities built into Orange's 5G network.""Raghav Sahgal  President of Cloud and Network Services at Nokia  said: ""This is an important step in our relationship with Orange and further validation of the steps we are taking in the API journey to help customers achieve network programmability and monetization. We look forward to our continued close cooperation with developers to create and drive new opportunities that support Orange in delivering even more value from its network assets.""About NokiaAt Nokia  we create technology that helps the world act together.As a B2B technology innovation leader  we are pioneering networks that sense  think and act by leveraging our work across mobile  fixed and cloud networks.

Due to the company's capabilities and the expertise of its people  Eviden representatives from Poland contributed to the Poland-Finland team that was awarded 2nd place  following on from Poland’s 3rd place ranking last year. This year also marks the 2nd consecutive participation of Romania  which teamed up with cybersecurity specialists from other countries.The exercise took place between 22 – 26 April and brought together almost 4 000 military and civilian cyber defense professionals  from more than 40 nations. Locked Shields as a platform enables countries to exchange best practices  innovate strategies  and collectively improve their cyber incident response capabilities.Eviden experts  through their participation in Locked Shields  have showcased a remarkable ability to navigate the complex cyber battleground  demonstrating resilience and strategic acumen in safeguarding digital fortresses. Their collective expertise has been pivotal in fortifying cyber defenses and fostering a culture of continuous learning and innovation.Chris Moret  Global Head of Cybersecurity Services at Eviden  Atos Group: ”Eviden takes pride in our team's achievements showcased at Locked Shields 2024. Being part of such an important project underscores the caliber of expertise within our company and reaffirms our dedication to fortifying cyber defenses on a global scale”.LtCol Urmet Tomp  Director of Locked Shields 2024: “Every year  Locked Shields aims to push the boundaries of what can be achieved in cyber defence training  and 2024 has been no exception. The skills trained here directly translate to stronger national defences against real-world cyber threats  enhancing our collective security”.Dr Mart Noorma  Director of the NATO CCDCOE: “The purpose of the exercise is to help our nations develop their capabilities to face cyber threats as a coalition. We have real threats around us  and most of our participants came out of the trenches of real cyber warfare to participate in Locked Shields. I am confident they will go back defending their nations stronger than ever”.Major General Engineer Gheorghe Iordache  Commander of the Cyber Defence Command  Romanian Ministry of National Defence: “We need to strengthen the link with the private sector to face more easily certain challenges which  at one point  could exceed our possibilities of reaction. It is no secret that NATO is also trying to bring together military and civilian specialized institutions in order to have a common reaction and to have some common compatibilities regarding the threats coming from the cyber space.”Together with colleagues from other countries  all Eviden experts proved the readiness of a fictitious country's defense structures against cyber-attacks targeting critical infrastructures. In addition to securing complex IT and operational systems  participating teams must be effective across a wide range of disciplines  including incident reporting and solving forensic  legal  media operations  and information warfare challenges.###Additional Information for journalists:About our teamsThe Eviden’s cyber security experts from Romania - Sergiu-Andrei Chirlejan (Threat Hunting team) and Bogdan Irimia (Software Mediation team) - were part of the international defense team (also called ""Blue Team""). This year marked Romania’s fourth consecutive participation  and 2nd for the Eviden Romania  teaming up with cybersecurity specialists from Bulgaria and Republic of Moldova. The Romanian team was coordinated by the Cyber Defense Agency within the Cyber Defense Command and consists of over 150 specialists from the national defense institutions  public order and national security system  but also from private companies active in the field  Eviden Romania being one of them.From Poland  Bartosz Wawrzyniak (Threat Intelligence team)  Piotr Mazurkiewicz (Computer Security Incident Response team)  Damian Falatyn (Computer Security Incident Response team) and Michal Cichorz (Computer Security Incident Response team) were part of the Finland-Poland team. They were part of the team that took 2nd place  making it two years in a row they've reached podium success. For Poland  this was the 3rd participation in the exercise  this year jointly with a team of cybersecurity experts from Finland.Their achievement was powered by Eviden's cloud-based Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) investigator tooling  which proved valuable during the forensics investigation. The exercise’s strength lies in its comprehensive approach  combining technical skills with strategic  legal  and communication expertise to develop a diverse defense strategy. The Poland team was coordinated by Cyberspace Defense Forces Component Command.What is Locked Shields?Locked Shields is the largest international Live Fire Exercise (LFX) in cyber-defense and is the most advanced in terms of technical expertise required. Participants are involved in a Red Team vs. Blue Team training exercise  where rapid response teams from NATO member states and partner countries help a fictitious country under a large-scale cyberattack to protect in real time computer networks of the government and critical national infrastructures (banking systems  gas and electricity distribution systems  satellite communication systems and 5G) against multiple and multidirectional cyber-attacks. Thus  teams can assess the ability to maintain functional systems in real situations and under special conditions.The exercise is designed to train and test teams of specialists by engaging them in solving complex scenarios and massive cyber incidents under intense pressure  including the areas of strategic decision  legal  public communication  as well as the evaluation  based on score  of the ability of teams to adapt and protect their own networks.***About Eviden1Eviden is a next-gen technology leader in data-driven  trusted and sustainable digital transformation with a strong portfolio of patented technologies.

The Romanian team …,"Press ReleaseEviden wins 2nd place in the world’s largest cyber defense exerciseEviden Poland team  part of the international Poland-Finland team  is on podium for second year in a rowParis  May 23  2024 - Eviden   the Atos Group business leading in digital  cloud  big data and security today announces that four of its cybersecurity experts based in Poland and two in Romania have participated in the largest international cyber defense exercise  ""Locked Shields 2024""  organized by the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defense Center of Excellence (CCDCOE) . Due to the company's capabilities and the expertise of its people  Eviden representatives from Poland contributed to the Poland-Finland team that was awarded 2nd place  following on from Poland’s 3rd place ranking last year. This year also marks the 2nd consecutive participation of Romania  which teamed up with cybersecurity specialists from other countries.The exercise took place between 22 – 26 April and brought together almost 4 000 military and civilian cyber defense professionals  from more than 40 nations. Locked Shields as a platform enables countries to exchange best practices  innovate strategies  and collectively improve their cyber incident response capabilities.Eviden experts  through their participation in Locked Shields  have showcased a remarkable ability to navigate the complex cyber battleground  demonstrating resilience and strategic acumen in safeguarding digital fortresses. Their collective expertise has been pivotal in fortifying cyber defenses and fostering a culture of continuous learning and innovation.Chris Moret  Global Head of Cybersecurity Services at Eviden  Atos Group: ”Eviden takes pride in our team's achievements showcased at Locked Shields 2024. Being part of such an important project underscores the caliber of expertise within our company and reaffirms our dedication to fortifying cyber defenses on a global scale”.LtCol Urmet Tomp  Director of Locked Shields 2024: “Every year  Locked Shields aims to push the boundaries of what can be achieved in cyber defence training  and 2024 has been no exception. The skills trained here directly translate to stronger national defences against real-world cyber threats  enhancing our collective security”.Dr Mart Noorma  Director of the NATO CCDCOE: “The purpose of the exercise is to help our nations develop their capabilities to face cyber threats as a coalition. We have real threats around us  and most of our participants came out of the trenches of real cyber warfare to participate in Locked Shields. I am confident they will go back defending their nations stronger than ever”.Major General Engineer Gheorghe Iordache  Commander of the Cyber Defence Command  Romanian Ministry of National Defence: “We need to strengthen the link with the private sector to face more easily certain challenges which  at one point  could exceed our possibilities of reaction. It is no secret that NATO is also trying to bring together military and civilian specialized institutions in order to have a common reaction and to have some common compatibilities regarding the threats coming from the cyber space.”Together with colleagues from other countries  all Eviden experts proved the readiness of a fictitious country's defense structures against cyber-attacks targeting critical infrastructures. In addition to securing complex IT and operational systems  participating teams must be effective across a wide range of disciplines  including incident reporting and solving forensic  legal  media operations  and information warfare challenges.###Additional Information for journalists:About our teamsThe Eviden’s cyber security experts from Romania - Sergiu-Andrei Chirlejan (Threat Hunting team) and Bogdan Irimia (Software Mediation team) - were part of the international defense team (also called ""Blue Team""). This year marked Romania’s fourth consecutive participation  and 2nd for the Eviden Romania  teaming up with cybersecurity specialists from Bulgaria and Republic of Moldova. The Romanian team was coordinated by the Cyber Defense Agency within the Cyber Defense Command and consists of over 150 specialists from the national defense institutions  public order and national security system  but also from private companies active in the field  Eviden Romania being one of them.From Poland  Bartosz Wawrzyniak (Threat Intelligence team)  Piotr Mazurkiewicz (Computer Security Incident Response team)  Damian Falatyn (Computer Security Incident Response team) and Michal Cichorz (Computer Security Incident Response team) were part of the Finland-Poland team. They were part of the team that took 2nd place  making it two years in a row they've reached podium success. For Poland  this was the 3rd participation in the exercise  this year jointly with a team of cybersecurity experts from Finland.Their achievement was powered by Eviden's cloud-based Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) investigator tooling  which proved valuable during the forensics investigation. The exercise’s strength lies in its comprehensive approach  combining technical skills with strategic  legal  and communication expertise to develop a diverse defense strategy. The Poland team was coordinated by Cyberspace Defense Forces Component Command.What is Locked Shields?Locked Shields is the largest international Live Fire Exercise (LFX) in cyber-defense and is the most advanced in terms of technical expertise required. Participants are involved in a Red Team vs. Blue Team training exercise  where rapid response teams from NATO member states and partner countries help a fictitious country under a large-scale cyberattack to protect in real time computer networks of the government and critical national infrastructures (banking systems  gas and electricity distribution systems  satellite communication systems and 5G) against multiple and multidirectional cyber-attacks. Thus  teams can assess the ability to maintain functional systems in real situations and under special conditions.The exercise is designed to train and test teams of specialists by engaging them in solving complex scenarios and massive cyber incidents under intense pressure  including the areas of strategic decision  legal  public communication  as well as the evaluation  based on score  of the ability of teams to adapt and protect their own networks.***About Eviden1Eviden is a next-gen technology leader in data-driven  trusted and sustainable digital transformation with a strong portfolio of patented technologies.

Prior to the launch of the offering  Robert Taub  who is the chairman of the board of directors  had expressed an interest to participate in the offering and purchase (either directly or indirectly through entities controlled/managed by him or otherwise) offered shares  it being understood that the number of offered shares allocated to Robert Taub (if any) and the applicable price would depend on the outcome of the offering process.As Robert Taub qualifies as a related party of the Company  the board of directors applied the related parties procedure of Article 7:97 of the Belgian Companies and Associations Code in connection with the potential participation of Robert Taub (either directly or indirectly through entities controlled/managed by him or otherwise) to the offering. Within the context of the aforementioned procedure  prior to resolving on the offering  a committee of three independent directors of the Company (the “Committee”) issued an advice to the board of directors in which the Committee assessed the participation of Robert Taub in the offering. In its advice to the board of directors  the Committee concluded the following: “Based on the information provided  the Committee considers that the proposed transaction is in line with the strategy pursued by the Company  will be done on market terms  and is unlikely to lead to disadvantages for the Company and its shareholders (in terms of dilution) that are not sufficiently compensated by the advantages that the transaction offers the Company”.When approving the offering  the Company’s board of directors did not deviate from the Committee's advice. The Company’s statutory auditor's assessment of the Committee's advice and the minutes of the meeting of the Company’s board of directors  is as follows: “Based on our limited review performed in accordance with ISRE 2410 "" Review of interim financial information performed by the independent auditor of the entity"" and the applicable standards of the ""Institut des Réviseurs d'Entreprises/Instituut der Bedrijfsrevisoren""  nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the financial and accounting data contained in the minutes of the board of directors’ meeting of May 22  2024 and in the advice of the committee of independent directors in accordance with article 7:97 of the Companies and Associations Code would contain material inconsistencies with the information available to us in the course of our engagement. However  we do not express an opinion on the value of the transaction or on the appropriateness of the decision of the board of directors”.Important InformationNo public offering will be made and no one has taken any action that would  or is intended to  permit a public offering in any country or jurisdiction  other than the United States  where any such action is required  including in Belgium.

Shares in the company rose 3 per cent to 47.4 cents in Dublin.“It provides an important financial backstop for the business through the completion of its ongoing strategic investment process  which we understand is progressing in line with expectations ” Mr Mitchell said.Corre  which floated on Euronext Dublin almost three years ago  said last month that it has hired investment bank Rothschild & Co to advise it on approaches it has had “from multiple parties” to invest in the company to provide it with additional funding for investment on projects and working capital.Shares in the company have fallen by more than 85 per cent over the past 12 months. This has been partly down to a slump across the wider green energy sector amid a decline in energy prices and the weight of higher interest rates on this capital-intensive sector.However  according to observers  it is also down to concerns about Corre having failed to sufficiently spell out the financial details of its various projects to allow investors assess their potential for profit.[ Ex-Corre Energy director says he is still committed to 38% stake after sudden exit ]Corre’s most advanced development is its Zuidwending (ZW1) project in the province of Groningen in the Netherlands. ZW1 will be capable of supplying up to 320MW of electricity to the grid for up to 3½ days and is due to come on stream around the end of 2026.Other key projects include Corre’s 320MW Green Hydrogen Hub project in Denmark  another facility in the Netherlands (ZW2) and a plan to develop three compressed air energy storage plants in caverns secured last year in Germany.Shares in Corre were hit in late February – falling below its €1 initial public offering price for the first time – when Mr Green stepped down as an executive director after a Singaporean company ultimately owned by him was named by UK tax authorities in relation to an alleged tax-avoidance scheme.Mr Green told The Irish Times that he was “absolutely astonished” by the news and had not been a director of – or been involved in the running of – that company for years.,neutral,0.22,0.76,0.02,negative,0.02,0.24,0.74,True,English,"['short-term cash', 'long-term investor', 'Corre', 'founders', '€', 'three compressed air energy storage plants', 'current monthly cash burn rate', '320MW Green Hydrogen Hub project', 'renewable energy storage developer', '€1 initial public offering price', 'Davy analyst Michael Mitchell', 'wider green energy sector', 'ongoing strategic investment process', 'up to 320MW', 'Darren Patrick Green', 'businessman Brendan Boyd', 'higher interest rates', 'Zuidwending (ZW1) project', 'UK tax authorities', 'The Irish Times', 'important financial backstop', 'Ex-Corre Energy director', 'up to 3½ days', 'other eligible shareholders', 'Other key projects', 'working capital runway', 'additional share sale', 'investment bank Rothschild', 'three months', 'energy prices', 'Mr Green', 'Mr Mitchell', 'capital-intensive sector', 'coming days', 'additional funding', 'financial details', 'founding shareholders', 'long-term investor', 'former director', 'chief executive', 'Keith McGrane', 'next stage', 'READ MORE', '€2.12 million proceeds', '85 per cent', 'past 12 months', 'various projects', 'sudden exit', 'advanced development', 'first time', 'executive director', 'tax-avoidance scheme', 'larger investors', 'Euronext Dublin', 'multiple parties', 'late February', 'Singaporean company', 'Dublin-listed', 'Thursday', 'talks', 'chance', 'stakes', 'placing', 'group', 'Shares', '47.4 cents', 'completion', 'line', 'expectations', 'approaches', 'slump', 'weight', 'observers', 'concerns', 'potential', 'profit', '38% stake', 'province', 'Groningen', 'Netherlands', 'electricity', 'grid', 'stream', 'Denmark', 'facility', 'caverns', 'Germany', 'relation', 'alleged', 'news', 'running', 'years']",2024-05-23,2024-05-24,irishtimes.com

HS is one of the most burdensome  chronic  systemic  inflammatory skin diseases that can have a profound impact on patients' health-related quality of life.2 3 4""Publication of results from the BE HEARD I and II trials in The Lancet  a world-leading medical journal  reflects the significance of these data to the dermatology community. People living with hidradenitis suppurativa face high unmet medical needs. The positive results from these trials support global regulatory submissions for BIMZELX in this chronic inflammatory skin disease "" said Emmanuel Caeymaex  Executive Vice President  Head of Patient Impact  Chief Commercial Officer  UCB.""The Phase 3 studies with bimekizumab represent a significant milestone for the hidradenitis suppurativa community  and they include HiSCR75  a high threshold endpoint  as a key ranked secondary outcome. In these studies  bimekizumab consistently demonstrated sustained improvements in clinical- as well as patient-reported outcomes for people with moderate to severe disease. These findings provide strong support for targeting IL-17A and IL-17F as a new and promising therapeutic approach for the future "" said Lead Investigator  Alexa B. Kimball  MD  MPH  Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Professor of Dermatology  Harvard Medical School  Boston  MA  U.S.In April 2024  UCB announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration accepted for review the supplemental biologics license application for BIMZELX for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe HS. In April 2024  UCB also announced that the European Commission granted marketing authorization for BIMZELX for the treatment of active moderate-to-severe HS in adults with an inadequate response to conventional systemic HS therapy. Other regulatory submissions for BIMZELX in the treatment of moderate-to-severe hidradenitis suppurativa are underway around the world.Notes to editors:About BE HEARD I and BE HEARD IIBE HEARD I and BE HEARD II were randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled  parallel-group  multicenter  Phase 3 trials designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab in adults with moderate-to-severe hidradenitis suppurativa (HS).1 The two trials had a combined enrolment of 1 014 participants with a diagnosis of moderate-to-severe HS.1 The primary endpoint in both trials was HiSCR50 at Week 16.1 A key secondary endpoint was HiSCR75 at Week 16.1 HiSCR50 and HiSCR75 are defined as at least either a 50 or 75 percent reduction from baseline in the total abscess and inflammatory nodule count  with no increase from baseline in abscess and inflammatory nodule count or draining tunnel count.1Results from BE HEARD I and BE HEARD II showed that a significantly higher proportion of patients treated with bimekizumab versus placebo achieved a 50 percent or greater improvement in HS signs and symptoms at Week 16  as measured by HiSCR50  the primary endpoint in both trials. Bimekizumab treatment also resulted in clinically meaningful improvements in the ranked key secondary endpoint  HiSCR75 versus placebo at Week 16. Responses were maintained to Week 48.1 The safety profile of bimekizumab was consistent with safety data seen in previous trials with no new observed safety signals.1About Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS)Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic  recurring  painful  and debilitating inflammatory skin disease.2 3 The main symptoms are nodules  abscesses  and pus-discharging fistulas (channels leading out of the skin)  which typically occur in the armpits  groin  and buttocks.2 3 People with HS experience flare-ups of the disease as well as severe pain  which can have a major impact on quality of life.2 3HS most commonly develops in early adulthood and affects approximately one percent of the population in most studied countries.2 3 Approximately one-third of people with HS have a family history of HS  and lifestyle factors such as smoking and obesity can also play a crucial role in the clinical course of HS.2 3The symptoms of pain  discharge  and scarring are not only a physical burden.2 5 People with HS also experience stigma: worrying about  or directly experiencing  negative attitudes  and reactions from society in response to their symptoms.4 These feelings can lead to embarrassment  social isolation  low self-esteem  and sexual life impairment  and impact all areas of life  including interpersonal relationships  education  and work.2 5About BIMZELX (bimekizumab-bkzx)Bimekizumab is a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to IL-17A  IL-17F  and IL-17AF cytokines  blocking their interaction with the IL-17RA/IL-17RC receptor complex.6In the U.S.  BIMZELX is approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy.6 BIMZELX is not approved in the U.S. for the treatment of moderate-to-severe hidradenitis suppurativa (HS). In the U.S.  the efficacy and safety of BIMZELX in the treatment of moderate-to-severe HS has not been established  and this is an investigational indication.BIMZELX is not approved in HS by any regulatory authority worldwide.Please see Important Safety Information below and full U.S. prescribing information at www.UCB- USA.com/Innovation/Products/BIMZELX .BIMZELX U.S. IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION6Suicidal Ideation and BehaviorBIMZELX® (bimekizumab-bkzx) may increase the risk of suicidal ideation and behavior (SI/B). A causal association between treatment with BIMZELX and increased risk of SI/B has not been established. Prescribers should weigh the potential risks and benefits before using BIMZELX in patients with a history of severe depression or SI/B. Advise monitoring for the emergence or worsening of depression  suicidal ideation  or other mood changes. If such changes occur  advise to promptly seek medical attention  refer to a mental health professional as appropriate  and re-evaluate the risks and benefits of continuing treatment.InfectionsBIMZELX may increase the risk of infections. Do not initiate treatment with BIMZELX in patients with any clinically important active infection until the infection resolves or is adequately treated. In patients with a chronic infection or a history of recurrent infection  consider the risks and benefits prior to prescribing BIMZELX. Instruct patients to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms suggestive of clinically important infection occur. If a patient develops such an infection or is not responding to standard therapy  monitor the patient closely and do not administer BIMZELX until the infection resolves.TuberculosisEvaluate patients for tuberculosis (TB) infection prior to initiating treatment with BIMZELX. Avoid the use of BIMZELX in patients with active TB infection. Initiate treatment of latent TB prior to administering BIMZELX. Consider anti-TB therapy prior to initiation of BIMZELX in patients with a past history of latent or active TB in whom an adequate course of treatment cannot be confirmed. Closely monitor patients for signs and symptoms of active TB during and after treatment.Liver Biochemical AbnormalitiesElevated serum transaminases were reported in clinical trials with BIMZELX. Test liver enzymes  alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin at baseline  periodically during treatment with BIMZELX and according to routine patient management. If treatment-related increases in liver enzymes occur and drug-induced liver injury is suspected  interrupt BIMZELX until a diagnosis of liver injury is excluded. Permanently discontinue use of BIMZELX in patients with causally associated combined elevations of transaminases and bilirubin. Avoid use of BIMZELX in patients with acute liver disease or cirrhosis.Inflammatory Bowel DiseaseCases of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have been reported in patients treated with IL-17 inhibitors  including BIMZELX. Avoid use of BIMZELX in patients with active IBD. During BIMZELX treatment  monitor patients for signs and symptoms of IBD and discontinue treatment if new onset or worsening of signs and symptoms occurs.ImmunizationsPrior to initiating therapy with BIMZELX  complete all age-appropriate vaccinations according to current immunization guidelines. Avoid the use of live vaccines in patients treated with BIMZELX.Most Common Adverse ReactionsMost common adverse reactions (≥1 percent) are upper respiratory infections  oral candidiasis  headache  injection site reactions  tinea infections  gastroenteritis  Herpes Simplex Infections  acne  folliculitis  other Candida infections  and fatigue.For further information  contact UCB:Investor RelationsAntje WitteT +32.2.559.94.14email antje.witte@ucb.comU.S. CommunicationsNicole HergaT +1.773.960.5349email nicole.herga@ucb.comAbout UCBUCB  Brussels  Belgium (www.ucb.com) is a global biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of innovative medicines and solutions to transform the lives of people living with severe diseases of the immune system or of the central nervous system.

(Euronext Amsterdam: VVY; NL00150002Q7) (Vivoryon)  a clinical stage company focused on the discovery and development of small molecule medicines to modulate the activity and stability of pathologically altered proteins  today announced financial results for the first quarter of 2024  ending March 31  2024  and provides a corporate update.“Vivoryon has now achieved proof of concept for varoglutamstat and validated the mechanism of action of QPCT/L inhibition. While the results in early AD were not what we had hoped for  we are excited about the promising effect of varoglutamstat on the pre-specified endpoint of kidney function given the established role of pro-inflammatory cytokines and peptides in driving the progression of kidney disease. In the past weeks  our team  which remains highly dedicated to driving our strategic shift and transformation  has continued to delve into the data on kidney function and we are pleased to see consistent results. We have observed robust and meaningful improvements in eGFR in patients treated with varoglutamstat compared to placebo across a range of different methods assessing eGFR. Effect sizes in favor of varoglutamstat were confirmed in patients with risk factors for CKD including diabetes and hypertension and were observed consistently across the range of eGFR baseline impairment levels in the study. We are now working on crystallizing our strategy and positioning in the kidney disease market and establishing potential clinical development plans for varoglutamstat in both large indications  such as CKD  and in certain rare diseases that impact kidney function ” said Frank Weber  MD  CEO of Vivoryon.Q1 2024 and Post-Period UpdatesStrategic shift towards a focus on inflammatory and fibrotic diseases:Following the announcement on March 4  2024  that the VIVIAD Phase 2b study did not achieve its primary and key secondary endpoints in early AD and the subsequent results showing a significant positive effect of varoglutamstat on kidney function  Vivoryon announced on April 24  2024  a strategic shift towards a focus on inflammatory and fibrotic diseases. Key priorities now include: exploring varoglutamstat’s potential in inflammatory and fibrotic disorders  including of the kidney; concluding VIVIAD Phase 2b clinical study program and in-depth analysis; discontinuing VIVA-MIND clinical Phase 2 study with varoglutamstat in the U.S. in early AD in the second half of 2024; leveraging the data from VIVA-MIND to inform next steps in AD; and continuing to actively pursue potential business development and financing opportunities.Varoglutamstat – kidney disease:QPCT/L inhibition has shown robust evidence of benefits in animal models of inflammatory and fibrotic disorders such as glomerulonephritis and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The VIVIAD protocol prospectively specified measurement of kidney function by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)  a primary endpoint in many development programs of kidney disorders  and additional biomarkers  in order to further investigate this potential activity.Varoglutamstat 600mg BID increased eGFR over the treatment period up to 96 weeks in patients with early AD  indicating a potential benefit of varoglutamstat on kidney function.Further sensitivity and subgroup analysis has shown this effect is observed across the range of eGFR levels at baseline in the study  and when assessed using a set of diverse and validated methods for calculating kidney function.Additionally  the Company has explored the effect of varoglutamstat on levels of pyroglu-CCL2 (pE-CCL2)  a pro-inflammatory cytokine. Persistent  low grade inflammation is considered a hallmark feature of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Results showed a significant and dose-dependent reduction in pE-CCL2 in the serum of VIVIAD patients following treatment with varoglutamstat. This demonstrates the effectiveness of varoglutamstat in inhibiting systemic intracellular QPCT/L and strongly supports an anti-inflammatory effect.Vivoryon is evaluating a clinical development path  as well as business development and financing opportunities  to further explore the potential of varoglutamstat and QPCT/L inhibitors in kidney disease in both large indications  such as CKD  and in certain rare diseases that impact kidney function  such as Alport Syndrome.Primary analysis of change of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR  slope analysis including all measurement timepoints during treatment):Annualized change of eGFR* P-Value Annualized Change of eGFR* P-Value Formula (creatinine) MDRD CKD-EPI 2021 Placebo -1.51 -0.75 Varoglutamstat +1.92 +1.44 Treatment Effect (Δ) 3.43 p=0.0002 2.19 p=0.0015* mL/min/1.73m2/yearSensitivity analysis of estimated glomerular filtration (eGFR) rate using Cystatin C and Creatinine (remeasured on Atellica® platform) CKD-EPI 2021 formula at baseline  week 24 and week 48:Cystatin C Cystatin C and Creatinine Creatinine Week 24 Week 48 Week 24 Week 48 Week 24 Week 48 Placebo(eGFR mL/min) 73.88 71.39 84.15 82.07 89.74 88.74 Varoglutamstat(eGFR mL/min) 78.15 80.88 88.91 91.21 93.33 93.98 Treatment Effect* (Δ) 4.27 9.49 4.76 9.14 3.59 5.24 P-Value 0.0186 <0.0001 0.0041 <0.0001 0.0019 0.0003* Baseline Adjusted LSMean EstimatesVaroglutamstat – early Alzheimer’s disease (AD):In recent weeks Vivoryon has continued its in-depth analysis of the VIVIAD data  following the March 4  2024  and April 24  2024  disclosures. While these analyses remain ongoing  findings to date continue to confirm there is no consistent effect of varoglutamstat up to 600mg BID on cognition and function  including in high exposure patients. Data from VIVA-MIND  anticipated by the end of 2024  is expected to contribute to the overall dataset informing varoglutamstat’s development strategy in AD.Early-Stage PipelineVivoryon’s main focus is on its clinical-stage activities  however it will continue to explore pre-clinical QPCT/L inhibitors for use in inflammatory and fibrotic disorders and other indications such as oncology and CNS as well as pre-clinical meprin inhibitors  in particular for fibrotic disorders  and QPCT/L inhibitors with good blood brain barrier penetration. The Company’s antibody program  PBD-C06  will remain active as a candidate for further potential partnering opportunities.Corporate Development UpdatesIn March 2024  Kugan Sathiyanandarajah and Professor Dr. Morten Asser Karsdal stepped down from Vivoryon’s Board of Directors. They had been appointed as Non-Executive Directors in June 2023.In March 2024  Anne Doering  CFA  assumed the role of Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of Vivoryon  following her previous position as Chief Strategy & Investor Relations Officer.In May 2024  Vivoryon announced it will hold its 2024 Annual General Meeting on Friday  June 21  2024  at 1:00 p.m. (CEST) in Amsterdam  the Netherlands. The full agenda and all relevant documents are available on the Company’s website (https://www.vivoryon.com/2024-annual-general-meeting/).Financial Results for the First Quarter of 2024Revenues were zero in the three months ended March 31  2024  as well as in the three months ended March 31  2023.Research and development expenses increased by EUR 4.3 million to EUR 7.4 million in the three months ended March 31  2024  compared to EUR 3.1 million in the three months ended March 31  2023. This increase was largely attributable to the increase in clinical development costs from the VIVIAD and VIVA-MIND studies.General and administrative expenses were EUR 2.1 million in the three months ended March 31  2024  compared to EUR 1.9 million in the three months ended March 31  2023. The increase of EUR 0.2 million was largely attributable to higher expenses for share-based payments as well as legal and consulting fees.Net loss for the three months ended March 31  2024  was EUR 9.3 million  compared to EUR 5.1 million for the three months ended March 31  2023.The Company held EUR 22.0 million in cash and cash equivalents as of March 31  2024  compared to EUR 28.6 million  which includes cash and cash equivalents and financial assets  as of December 31  2023.Outlook & Financial GuidanceAs published on April 24  2024  the Company expects  on the basis of its most recent financial and business plan  that its existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund its operating plans  excluding any additional financings  into the second quarter of 2025.This cash runway guidance reflects the shift in focus of research and development resources towards inflammatory and fibrotic disorders  such as of the kidney  and an overall reduction in cash utilization including the ramp down of spending on VIVIAD as it approaches its conclusion  the discontinuation of VIVA-MIND  the discontinuation of VIVALONG preparation activities given the developments of VIVIAD and VIVA-MIND  as well as the streamlining of manufacturing costs and programs for API development.The viability of the Company beyond the second quarter of 2025 is dependent on its ability to raise additional funds to finance its operations which also depends on the success of its research and development activities such as those focusing on exploring opportunities in kidney disease.Conference Call and WebcastVivoryon will host a conference call and webcast today  May 23  2024  at 3:00 pm CEST (9:00 am EDT).

(Euronext Amsterdam: VVY; NL00150002Q7) (Vivoryon)  a clinical stage company focused on the discovery and development of small molecule medicines to modulate the activity and stability of pathologically altered proteins  today announced financial results for the first quarter of 2024  ending March 31  2024  and provides a corporate update.“Vivoryon has now achieved proof of concept for varoglutamstat and validated the mechanism of action of QPCT/L inhibition. While the results in early AD were not what we had hoped for  we are excited about the promising effect of varoglutamstat on the pre-specified endpoint of kidney function given the established role of pro-inflammatory cytokines and peptides in driving the progression of kidney disease. In the past weeks  our team  which remains highly dedicated to driving our strategic shift and transformation  has continued to delve into the data on kidney function and we are pleased to see consistent results. We have observed robust and meaningful improvements in eGFR in patients treated with varoglutamstat compared to placebo across a range of different methods assessing eGFR. Effect sizes in favor of varoglutamstat were confirmed in patients with risk factors for CKD including diabetes and hypertension and were observed consistently across the range of eGFR baseline impairment levels in the study. We are now working on crystallizing our strategy and positioning in the kidney disease market and establishing potential clinical development plans for varoglutamstat in both large indications  such as CKD  and in certain rare diseases that impact kidney function ” said Frank Weber  MD  CEO of Vivoryon.Q1 2024 and Post-Period UpdatesStrategic shift towards a focus on inflammatory and fibrotic diseases:Following the announcement on March 4  2024  that the VIVIAD Phase 2b study did not achieve its primary and key secondary endpoints in early AD and the subsequent results showing a significant positive effect of varoglutamstat on kidney function  Vivoryon announced on April 24  2024  a strategic shift towards a focus on inflammatory and fibrotic diseases. Key priorities now include: exploring varoglutamstat’s potential in inflammatory and fibrotic disorders  including of the kidney; concluding VIVIAD Phase 2b clinical study program and in-depth analysis; discontinuing VIVA-MIND clinical Phase 2 study with varoglutamstat in the U.S. in early AD in the second half of 2024; leveraging the data from VIVA-MIND to inform next steps in AD; and continuing to actively pursue potential business development and financing opportunities.Varoglutamstat – kidney disease:QPCT/L inhibition has shown robust evidence of benefits in animal models of inflammatory and fibrotic disorders such as glomerulonephritis and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The VIVIAD protocol prospectively specified measurement of kidney function by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR)  a primary endpoint in many development programs of kidney disorders  and additional biomarkers  in order to further investigate this potential activity.Varoglutamstat 600mg BID increased eGFR over the treatment period up to 96 weeks in patients with early AD  indicating a potential benefit of varoglutamstat on kidney function.Further sensitivity and subgroup analysis has shown this effect is observed across the range of eGFR levels at baseline in the study  and when assessed using a set of diverse and validated methods for calculating kidney function.Additionally  the Company has explored the effect of varoglutamstat on levels of pyroglu-CCL2 (pE-CCL2)  a pro-inflammatory cytokine. Persistent  low grade inflammation is considered a hallmark feature of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Results showed a significant and dose-dependent reduction in pE-CCL2 in the serum of VIVIAD patients following treatment with varoglutamstat. This demonstrates the effectiveness of varoglutamstat in inhibiting systemic intracellular QPCT/L and strongly supports an anti-inflammatory effect.Vivoryon is evaluating a clinical development path  as well as business development and financing opportunities  to further explore the potential of varoglutamstat and QPCT/L inhibitors in kidney disease in both large indications  such as CKD  and in certain rare diseases that impact kidney function  such as Alport Syndrome.Primary analysis of change of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR  slope analysis including all measurement timepoints during treatment):Annualized change of eGFR* P-Value Annualized Change of eGFR* P-Value Formula (creatinine) MDRD CKD-EPI 2021 Placebo -1.51 -0.75 Varoglutamstat +1.92 +1.44 Treatment Effect (Δ) 3.43 p=0.0002 2.19 p=0.0015* mL/min/1.73m2/yearSensitivity analysis of estimated glomerular filtration (eGFR) rate using Cystatin C and Creatinine (remeasured on Atellica® platform) CKD-EPI 2021 formula at baseline  week 24 and week 48:Cystatin C Cystatin C and Creatinine Creatinine Week 24 Week 48 Week 24 Week 48 Week 24 Week 48 Placebo(eGFR mL/min) 73.88 71.39 84.15 82.07 89.74 88.74 Varoglutamstat(eGFR mL/min) 78.15 80.88 88.91 91.21 93.33 93.98 Treatment Effect* (Δ) 4.27 9.49 4.76 9.14 3.59 5.24 P-Value 0.0186 <0.0001 0.0041 <0.0001 0.0019 0.0003* Baseline Adjusted LSMean EstimatesVaroglutamstat – early Alzheimer’s disease (AD):In recent weeks Vivoryon has continued its in-depth analysis of the VIVIAD data  following the March 4  2024  and April 24  2024  disclosures. While these analyses remain ongoing  findings to date continue to confirm there is no consistent effect of varoglutamstat up to 600mg BID on cognition and function  including in high exposure patients. Data from VIVA-MIND  anticipated by the end of 2024  is expected to contribute to the overall dataset informing varoglutamstat’s development strategy in AD.Early-Stage PipelineVivoryon’s main focus is on its clinical-stage activities  however it will continue to explore pre-clinical QPCT/L inhibitors for use in inflammatory and fibrotic disorders and other indications such as oncology and CNS as well as pre-clinical meprin inhibitors  in particular for fibrotic disorders  and QPCT/L inhibitors with good blood brain barrier penetration. The Company’s antibody program  PBD-C06  will remain active as a candidate for further potential partnering opportunities.Corporate Development UpdatesIn March 2024  Kugan Sathiyanandarajah and Professor Dr. Morten Asser Karsdal stepped down from Vivoryon’s Board of Directors. They had been appointed as Non-Executive Directors in June 2023.In March 2024  Anne Doering  CFA  assumed the role of Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of Vivoryon  following her previous position as Chief Strategy & Investor Relations Officer.In May 2024  Vivoryon announced it will hold its 2024 Annual General Meeting on Friday  June 21  2024  at 1:00 p.m. (CEST) in Amsterdam  the Netherlands.

HS is one of the most burdensome  chronic  systemic  inflammatory skin diseases that can have a profound impact on patients' health-related quality of life.2 3 4""Publication of results from the BE HEARD I and II trials in The Lancet  a world-leading medical journal  reflects the significance of these data to the dermatology community. People living with hidradenitis suppurativa face high unmet medical needs. The positive results from these trials support global regulatory submissions for bimekizumab in this chronic inflammatory skin disease "" said Emmanuel Caeymaex  Executive Vice President  Head of Patient Impact  Chief Commercial Officer  UCB.""The Phase 3 studies with bimekizumab represent a significant milestone for the hidradenitis suppurativa community  and they include HiSCR75  a high threshold endpoint  as a key ranked secondary outcome. In these studies  bimekizumab consistently demonstrated sustained improvements in clinical- as well as patient-reported outcomes for people with moderate to severe disease. These findings provide strong support for targeting IL-17A and IL-17F as a new and promising therapeutic approach for the future "" said Lead Investigator  Alexa B. Kimball  MD  MPH  Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Professor of Dermatology  Harvard Medical School  Boston  MA  U.S.In April 2024  UCB announced that the European Commission granted marketing authorization for bimekizumab for the treatment of active moderate to severe HS in adults with an inadequate response to conventional systemic HS therapy. In April 2024  UCB also announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration accepted for review the supplemental biologics license application for bimekizumab-bkzx for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe HS. Other regulatory submissions for bimekizumab in the treatment of moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa are underway around the world.Notes to editors:About BE HEARD I and BE HEARD IIBE HEARD I and BE HEARD II were randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled  parallel-group  multicenter  Phase 3 trials designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bimekizumab in adults with moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (HS).1 The two trials had a combined enrolment of 1 014 participants with a diagnosis of moderate to severe HS.1 The primary endpoint in both trials was HiSCR50 at Week 16.1 A key secondary endpoint was HiSCR75 at Week 16.1 HiSCR50 and HiSCR75 are defined as at least either a 50 or 75 percent reduction from baseline in the total abscess and inflammatory nodule count  with no increase from baseline in abscess and inflammatory nodule count or draining tunnel count.1Results from BE HEARD I and BE HEARD II showed that a significantly higher proportion of patients treated with bimekizumab versus placebo achieved a 50 percent or greater improvement in HS signs and symptoms at Week 16  as measured by HiSCR50  the primary endpoint in both trials. Bimekizumab treatment also resulted in clinically meaningful improvements in the ranked key secondary endpoint  HiSCR75 versus placebo at Week 16. Responses were maintained to Week 48.1 The safety profile of bimekizumab was consistent with safety data seen in previous trials with no new observed safety signals.1About hidradenitis suppurativa (HS)Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic  recurring  painful  and debilitating inflammatory skin disease  that is associated with systemic manifestations.2 3 The main symptoms are nodules  abscesses  and pus-discharging fistulas (channels leading out of the skin) which typically occur in the armpits  groin  and buttocks.2 3 People with HS experience flare-ups of the disease as well as severe pain  which can have a major impact on quality of life.2 3 HS most commonly develops in early adulthood and affects approximately one percent of the population in most studied countries.2 3 Approximately one-third of people with HS have a family history of HS  and lifestyle factors such as smoking and obesity can also play a crucial role in the clinical course of HS.2 3 The symptoms of pain  discharge and scarring are not only a physical burden. People with HS also experience stigma: worrying about  or directly experiencing  negative attitudes and reactions from society in response to their symptoms.4 These feelings can lead to embarrassment  social isolation  low self-esteem and sexual life impairment  and impact all areas of life  including interpersonal relationships  education  and work.5About bimekizumabBIMZELX® (bimekizumab) is a humanized monoclonal IgG1 antibody designed to selectively inhibit both interleukin 17A (IL-17A) and interleukin 17F (IL-17F)  two key cytokines driving inflammatory processes.6The therapeutic indications in the EU are7:Plaque psoriasis: Bimekizumab is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates for systemic therapy.Psoriatic arthritis: Bimekizumab  alone or in combination with methotrexate  is indicated for the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis in adults who have had an inadequate response or who have been intolerant to one or more disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs).Axial Spondyloarthritis: Bimekizumab is indicated for the treatment of adults with active non radiographic axial spondyloarthritis with objective signs of inflammation as indicated by elevated C reactive protein (CRP)  and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) who have responded inadequately or are intolerant to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)  and for the treatment of adults with active ankylosing spondylitis who have responded inadequately or are intolerant to conventional therapy.Hidradenitis suppurativa: Bimekizumab is indicated for the treatment of active moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (HS; acne inversa) in adults with an inadequate response to conventional systemic HS therapy.BIMZELX® ▼ (bimekizumab) EU/EEA* Important Safety Information7The most frequently reported adverse reactions with bimekizumab were upper respiratory tract infections (14.5%  14.6%  16.3%  8.8% in plaque psoriasis  psoriatic arthritis  axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) and hidradenitis suppurativa  respectively) and oral candidiasis (7.3%  2.3%  3.7%  5.6% in PSO  PsA  axSpA and HS  respectively). Common adverse reactions (≥1/100 to <1/10) were oral candidiasis  tinea infections  ear infections  herpes simplex infections  oropharyngeal candidiasis  gastroenteritis  folliculitis  vulvovaginal mycotic infection (including vulvovaginal candidiasis)  headache  rash  dermatitis and eczema  acne  injection site reactions  fatigue.

The Company is addressing a hugely important global market with its proven and scalable innovative technology that enables a more sustainable and healthier life for everyone  with multiple applications across water  air and surface disinfection. Its UV-C LED products are a highly effective replacement to current methods through a lower power consumption  CO2 footprint and cost  as well as being environmentally safe.Q1 2024 and Post Period HighlightsQ1:Global sales pipeline further scaled  with 24 new design-ins and 5 design-wins  an increase of 45% during the quarter60% of the design-wins in water  one of them with a global acting strategic key customer in AMERICAS in the Point of Use water treatment segment  and 40% in surface disinfectionOngoing commercial traction and active discussions with a number of global names  some advancedAchieved first cost reduction for the UV-C LED product  providing benefits to customers through a 10% lower pricing and improving CrayoNano's competitiveness in the marketplacePost period end:Dr. Thomas Dobbertin appointed as CEO  strengthening and expanding the breadth of the Executive Team2 new design-in partnership agreements signed with leading LED module experts: YuGuang Electronics and Taiwan Semiconductor Lighting Company (TSLC)5 design-wins secured  illustrating the positive advancement of the pipeline following actively working with partners on design-insGood progress being made in product development  and targeting to reduce the price-performance parameter by 50%  with pilot products anticipated to be ready by end Q4 2024Jens Kielland  CFO  said:""We continued to gain commercial traction and improve our competitiveness in the market during Q1 24. We are in active discussions with a number of global names  some advanced  and hope to announce a further contract as well as other strategic and commercial partnerships shortly. We are confident we can deliver meaningful progress in 2024 and are focused on scaling revenue  continuing to optimise our operating structure  and ongoing product development to grow our total addressable market.""Introduction and Q1 2024 OverviewRecently the market has been experiencing longer qualification and design-in lead times  and therefore longer market entry timelines for products. This had a temporary impact on CrayoNano's conversion of its extensive sales pipeline into further revenue growth in Q1 2024. Notwithstanding this  CrayoNano is in active discussions with a number of global names  some advanced  which could meaningfully scale revenue in the near-term  and hopes to announce a new contract as well as other partnerships shortly.Alongside advancing contracts  progress in Q1 2024 included the further scaling of the global sales pipeline including design-ins  and improvements to the competitiveness of the UV-C LED product in the marketplace thereby growing the total addressable market. CrayoNano continues to have a secure order book of initial volume sales  and with the considerable scope to add contracts as the year progresses  is confident in the outturn for 2024.Operational ReviewPipeline and SalesCrayoNano's key growth indicator is its sales funnel and pipeline. As above the extensive global sales pipeline covering APAC  AMERICAS and EMEA was further scaled in the period  demonstrating ongoing customer attraction and commercial traction. At the end of Q1 2024  CrayoNano had a pipeline featuring 170 sales leads  144 opportunities  76 ongoing design-in activities  and 16 design-wins. Within this  CrayoNano acquired 24 new design-ins and 5 design-wins  an increase of 45% during the quarter. They remain a key focus as they validate the commerciality of CrayoNano's product and lead to significant revenue opportunity.CrayoNano is currently focused on the more developed market areas such as the water disinfection sector  and the most meaningful opportunities in its pipeline supported by selective sales campaigns. CrayoNano is currently in active discussions and working closely with several global names  including a leading home appliance manufacturer  and hopes to announce a new design-in with a blue-chip brand shortly  as well as other strategic and commercial partnerships.CrayoNano continues to have an order book of a minimum NOK 13m value to be delivered in 2024  with opportunities to increase the value of each secured frame contract beyond the initial volume amounts  as well as add meaningful new contracts as above. As detailed in the Financial Update below  revenue growth is anticipated to be second-half weighted due to the anticipated lead times.Sales Channel NetworkCrayoNano has continued to expand and leverage its sales channel partner network that was strongly established throughout 2023. To-date  CrayoNano has a total of 15 partner contracts in place across APAC  AMERICAS and EMEA  with the network supported by CrayoNano's own local sales representatives across five countries.CrayoNano continues be highly visibility in the marketplace  receiving very positive feedback from both customers and the wider industry  and recently attended the IUVA conference in the USA.Operations and Supply ChainCrayoNano strategically invested in its operations and inventory throughout 2023  and is commercially ready to deliver on its initial order book and large scale volume orders with little additional capex due to its fab-lite strategy.Following the considerable progress made during 2023  CrayoNano is continuing to look at optimising its operating structure and introduce further efficiencies  including through increasing the level of operative business in Taiwan  the home of the semiconductor industry. By moving more of its supply chain operations to Taiwan  CrayoNano can generate significant cost savings  in line with its fab-lite model. As part of this  CrayoNano is currently in the process of onboarding and qualifying samples for a corresponding package foundry partnership  and anticipates signing a contract during Q3 2024.Executive TeamIt was announced on 13 May 2024 that Dr. Thomas Dobbertin had joined CrayoNano as CEO  strengthening and expanding the breadth of the Executive Team. Dr. Dobbertin has an extensive international track-record in leadership positions in the photonics and semiconductor industry  and will work alongside Jens Kielland who has resumed his role as CFO and the rest of the team. Dr. Dobbertin was formerly General Manager and Vice President at ams AG in Singapore for optical components and prior to this  headed up the global laser business at OSRAM Opto in Germany  servicing tier-1 clients globally.Product DevelopmentCrayoNano has made further progress in the development of its next UV-C LEDs  and is continuing to grow the total addressable market and applications for its product through ongoing technology and pricing. Through recent engineering  CrayoNano has been able to achieve a first cost reduction for its UV-C LED product  providing benefits to customers through a 10% lower pricing and improving its competitiveness in the marketplace. CrayoNano is still targeting to implement a significant step forward to a market leading position by reducing the price-performance parameter by 50%. Good progress was made in Q1 2024 and to date  with pilot products anticipated to be ready by end Q4 2024 followed by production and deliveries in Q2 2025. Driving down the price-performance KPI is key to growing the total addressable market and becoming competitive against other disinfection technology.Post Period UpdatePost the period end to-date  CrayoNano has signed two new design-in partnership agreements  the first being with YuGuang Electronics  representing CrayoNano's third design-in partnership in the Asia-Pacific region. YuGuang Electronics is a leader in LED module and light engine manufacturing  and the partnership serves to strengthen CrayoNano's operations and market presence in the water disinfection sector. In May 2024  CrayoNano then signed a design-in partnership with Taiwan Semiconductor Lighting Company (TSLC)  a renown UK-LED system and module design expert.CrayoNano has also secured five design-wins since the period end to date  illustrating the ongoing positive advancement of the pipeline following actively working with partners on design-ins. These design-wins cover a disinfection solution for the Korean public transportation system  water and surface disinfection for smart farming  and further water disinfection reactors.Q1 2024 Financial UpdateRevenue and Operating CostsSales revenue in Q1 2024 was NOK 129 000 (Q1 2023: NOK 135 000) and related to sample shipments to prospective customers and initial sales to distributors. The sales performance reflects the longer lead-times as detailed above. Notwithstanding this  and as detailed in the Operational Review  CrayoNano continues to have a secure order book of a minimum NOK 13m to be delivered in 2024  expected to be second-half weighted  with opportunities to increase the value of existing contracts  and add meaningful new ones.Total operating costs in Q1 2024 were NOK 17.3m  a decrease of NOK 6.0m (25.8%) compared with Q1 2023 (Q1 2023: NOK 23.3m). This reflects success in optimising the operating structure and introducing efficiencies  including the strategically important moving of operations to Taiwan. Further operating efficiencies are expected to be introduced over the coming year due to the actions detailed in the Operational Review. As a result  despite considerable scaling of revenue in 2024 against 2023 (2023: total revenue NOK 0.9m)  total operating costs in 2024 are anticipated to be of a similar level to 2023.CrayoNano already has the operating structure and purchased inventory in place to deliver on the initial NOK 13m order book. In addition  only modest additional operating costs and capex would be required to deliver on additional large scale volume orders. With CrayoNano's fab-lite strategy  capex requirements are low  with capex mainly related to R&D and intangible assets.As a consequence of the optimisation and efficiencies to-date  EBITDA in Q1 2024 was NOK -17.2m  a reduction of NOK 4.2m against Q1 2023 (Q1 2023: NOK -21.5m).Cash Flow Development and Balance SheetNet cash flow from operating activities in Q1 2024 was NOK -15.7m (Q1 2023: NOK -24.0m; Q4 2023: NOK -19.0m). At the end of Q1 2024  available cash was NOK 13.2m (Q4 2023: NOK 40.5m)  including that available through its asset backed lending facility. This facility was successfully secured in 2023  and can be increased based on the scale-up of commercial activities.The reduction in available cash is driven by; i) a negative operating result; ii) an increase in working capital including a continued modest investment in inventory to support delivery and scaling of revenue in 2024; and iii) a final patent payment.Having strategic inventory is an important asset to support revenue generation as well as mitigate against any product availability constraints in the market. Inventory was NOK 14.8m at the end of Q1 2024  a modest increase on Q4 2023 (Q4 2023: NOK 13.7m).FinancingAs detailed in the Q4 2023 Investor Update  CrayoNano has a funding requirement prior to reaching breakeven through the scaling of revenue  and continues to look at a number of options in relation to funding. The Company continues to progress both short-term and longer-term funding discussions  and hopes to be in a position to provide an update on short-term funding very shortly  with any offer being made available to all shareholders on the same terms.At the current monthly opex of approximately NOK 6m  CrayoNano would be breakeven at approximately NOK 150m sales revenue using a +50% gross margin assumption. To give an idea of the progression to breakeven  the weighted pipeline for 2024 currently shows projected sales revenue of NOK 67m  and NOK 133m for 2025. The sales pipeline contains many large individual potential contracts  so any one of these would materially advance CrayoNano to a breakeven position.Q1 2024 Results Presentation and Q&ACrayoNano will deliver a live presentation via webcast at 10:00 CET today (09:00 GMT). The live video webcast will be accessible via the Company's website: https://webcast.openbriefing.com/crayonano-may24/Presentation is available here.An audio recording will also be made available after the webcast via the same link.For more information  please contact:CFO Jens KiellandEmail investor@crayonano.comPhone +47 72 90 98 60About CrayoNanoCrayoNano develops and manufactures nanomaterials-based semiconductor components using proprietary technologies.
