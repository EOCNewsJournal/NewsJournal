Earlier in the year  Hungary was for weeks the sole country blocking the EU's $54 billion aid package for the Kiev regime.Hungary is yet again refusing to kowtow to EU diktat on funding weapons for the Kiev regime. In this case  it is reportedly holding up legislation to fast-track handing Ukraine profits from illegally frozen Russian assets.Specifically  it is objecting to forgoing a requirement for unanimous backing from all 27 member states for each cash disbursement to Kiev  the Financial Times reported  citing sources.""For the time being they are blocking everything connected to the military support to Ukraine "" one insider was cited as saying  adding that Budapest would likely stick to its guns until the European elections in June.EU officials are said to have offered Hungary an arrangement whereby their share of the funds would not be used to purchase weapons for Ukraine. This reportedly stopped Budapest from vetoing the scheme entirely. But Budapest's concerns were about making payments automatic  one source claimed.Hungary has staunchly refused to be pressured into funding the ongoing NATO proxy conflict in Ukraine. Prime Minister Viktor Orban reiterated this stance on Friday  as he appeared on state radio.""We do not approve of this  nor do we want to participate in financial or arms support [for Ukraine ] even within the framework of NATO "" Orban said  adding that Hungary has to ""redefine our position within the military alliance  and our lawyers and officers are working on ... how Hungary can exist as a NATO member while not participating in NATO actions outside of its territory.""Last December  Orban held up the EU's allocation of 50 billion euros in aid to Ukraine  and has been adamant that the conflict cannot be settled on the battlefield.In a decision that took months of debate  the European Union announced on Tuesday that it had approved the use of income from frozen Russian assets for Ukraine. Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky added that 90% of the sum would go to the Ukrainian Armed Forces. It is estimated that an interest worth up to three billion euros ($3.25 billion) could be used for weapons from the EU to prop up Kiev's military  mired in manpower and hardware shortages  and battlefield woes.The EU published a detailed decision on frozen Russian assets as part of the package of economic sanctions against Moscow  effective as of May 23.Following the start of Russia's special military operation  the US-led West slapped widespread sanctions on Moscow  including freezing Russian assets worth approximately 300 billion euros ($329 billion). The bulk of this sum  approximately 200 billion euros ($221 billion)  is being held in the European Union  predominantly in accounts at Euroclear  a European central securities depository.There is also a separate US plan in the works to issue a loan to Ukraine - possibly worth around $50 billion - that could be repaid by the future income earned on the Russian assets. The plan has been pushed by US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen for months. Finance chiefs of the G7 are ""making progress"" on ways to use income from frozen Russian assets ""to the benefit of Ukraine "" according to a draft statement cited by Reuters.According to Germany's Finance Minister Christian Lindner  Berlin was ""prepared to take further steps that would not have any legally disadvantageous or economically risky consequences."" A final decision is expected at the G7 summit in Italy on June 13-15.Western governments  faced with legal challenges that seizing Russian assets outright would entail  have decided to use the interest accrued from these assets. They believe that such a strategy exposes them to less legal liability.Moscow has castigated the decision by the EU to use income from frozen Russian sovereign assets to help Ukraine as expropriation  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Wednesday.""They see the potential danger of such decisions and understand the danger for them of the potential consequences that are inevitable  so they went for a truncated version  but the truncated version is nothing more than expropriation "" Peskov told reporters.Russia will continue assessing the consequences of the EU's decision and its response  Peskov added.From the outset  Russia has warned that the EU plan to seize Russian Central Bank assets was an ""escalation of economic aggression"" and a gross violation of the West's own law  international rules  and bilateral obligations. Russia has reserved the right to respond in a correspondingly harsh manner.Â© SputnikNEWS LETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address",neutral,0.06,0.79,0.15,negative,0.02,0.28,0.7,True,English,"['Frozen Russian Assets', 'EU Pressure', 'Hungary', 'Ukraine', 'Profits', 'US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen', 'Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky', 'independent foreign policy course', 'GlobalSecurity.org mailing list', 'Finance Minister Christian Lindner', 'Prime Minister Viktor Orban', 'ongoing NATO proxy war', 'European central securities depository', 'ongoing NATO proxy conflict', 'Russian Central Bank assets', 'Ukrainian Armed Forces', 'separate US plan', 'less legal liability', 'special military operation', 'economically risky consequences', 'three billion euros', 'Frozen Russian Assets', 'Russian sovereign assets', '$54 billion aid package', 'Finance chiefs', '50 billion euros', '200 billion euros', 'NATO member', 'NATO actions', 'European elections', 'European Union', 'legal challenges', 'Svetlana Ekimenko', 'sole country', 'unanimous backing', '27 member states', 'cash disbursement', 'military support', 'one insider', 'one source', 'state radio', 'arms support', 'military alliance', 'hardware shortages', 'economic sanctions', 'widespread sanctions', 'draft statement', 'Western governments', 'Kremlin spokesman', 'potential consequences', 'truncated version', 'economic aggression', 'gross violation', 'international rules', 'bilateral obligations', 'harsh manner', 'NEWS LETTER', 'Email Address', 'EU Pressure', 'Sputnik News', 'Kiev regime', 'EU diktat', 'Financial Times', 'EU officials', 'battlefield woes', 'The EU', 'US-led West', 'G7 summit', 'potential danger', 'EU plan', 'detailed decision', 'final decision', 'Dmitry Peskov', 'future income', 'Ukraine profits', '© Sputnik', 'Hungary', 'year', 'weeks', 'funding', 'weapons', 'case', 'legislation', 'requirement', 'sources', 'everything', 'Budapest', 'guns', 'June', 'arrangement', 'share', 'funds', 'scheme', 'concerns', 'payments', 'stance', 'Friday', 'framework', 'position', 'lawyers', 'officers', 'territory', 'allocation', 'months', 'debate', 'Tuesday', 'use', 'interest', 'manpower', 'part', 'Moscow', 'May', 'start', 'bulk', 'accounts', 'Euroclear', 'works', 'loan', 'progress', 'ways', 'benefit', 'Reuters', 'Germany', 'Berlin', 'steps', 'legally', 'disadvantageous', 'Italy', 'strategy', 'expropriation', 'Wednesday', 'decisions', 'reporters', 'response', 'outset', 'escalation', 'right']",2024-05-26,2024-05-27,globalsecurity.org
