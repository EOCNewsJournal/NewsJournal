The company’s oncology-focused pipeline is designed to act on the tumor microenvironment (TME) and the cancer immunity cycle by breaking tumor protection barriers against the immune system and blocking tumor repair. By neutralizing chemokines in the TME  TME Pharma’s approach works in combination with other forms of treatment to weaken tumor defenses and enable greater therapeutic impact. In the GLORIA Phase 1/2 clinical trial  TME Pharma is studying its lead drug candidate NOX-A12 in newly diagnosed brain cancer patients who will not benefit clinically from standard chemotherapy. TME Pharma has delivered top-line data from the NOX-A12 three dose-escalation cohorts combined with radiotherapy of the GLORIA clinical trial  observing consistent tumor reductions and objective tumor responses. Additionally  GLORIA expansion arms evaluate safety and efficacy of NOX-A12 in other combinations where the interim results from the triple combination of NOX-A12  radiotherapy and bevacizumab suggest even deeper and more durable responses  and improved survival. US FDA has approved the design of a randomized Phase 2 trial in glioblastoma and TME Pharma was awarded fast track designation by the FDA for NOX-A12 in combination with radiotherapy and bevacizumab for use in the treatment of the aggressive adult brain cancer  glioblastoma. NOX-A12 in combination with radiotherapy had also previously received orphan drug designation (ODD) for glioblastoma in the United States and glioma in Europe. TME Pharma has delivered final top-line data with encouraging overall survival and safety profile from its NOX-A12 combination trial with Keytruda® in metastatic colorectal and pancreatic cancer patients  which was published in the Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer in October 2021. The company has entered in its second collaboration with MSD/Merck for its Phase 2 study  OPTIMUS  to further evaluate safety and efficacy of NOX-A12 in combination with Merck’s Keytruda® and two different chemotherapy regimens as second-line therapy in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. The design of the trial has been approved in France  Spain and the United States. The company’s second clinical-stage drug candidate  NOX-E36  is designed to target the innate immune system. TME Pharma is considering several solid tumors for further clinical development.

A post-hoc analysis of brain imaging at 0 and 24 hours using artificial intelligence confirmed these results  showing a reduction in the number and volume of intracerebral lesions in patients treated with glenzocimab.On April 25  2024  the company announced the initial results of the international phase 2/3 ACTISAVE study in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke  which showed no efficacy of glenzocimab on the primary endpoint  the proportion of patients with severe disability or death (mRS 4-6) 90 days after stroke  nor on the secondary endpoint  the proportion of patients returning to life without disability (mRS 0-2).On May 15  2024  Prof. Mikael KÃ¶hrmann (Principal Investigator of ACTISAVE) presented the main results of the study at the opening session of the European Stroke Organization Conference (ESOC)  confirming the neutrality of the study on the primary and secondary endpoints  and showing trends in return to normal life (mRS 0-1)  notably in sub-populations of patients with complete recanalization after mechanical thrombectomy.Glenzocimab is being evaluated in 2 other clinical trials initiated by academic teams:GREEN: a phase 2/3 study in the treatment of stroke in thrombectomized patients  with a futility analysis after inclusion of the first 78 patients (30% of patients) expected in Q4 2024;LIBERATE: a Phase 2b LIBERATE trial in the treatment of myocardial infarction  with final results expected in Q4 2025.Acticor Biotech is supported by a panel of European and international investors (Mediolanum farmaceutici  Karista  Go Capital  Newton Biocapital  CMS Medical Venture Investment (HK) Limited  A&B (HK) Limited  Anaxago  and the Armesa Foundation) and has been listed on Euronext Growth Paris since November 2021 (ISIN: FR0014005OJ5 - ALACT).View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240527866847/en/ACTICOR BIOTECHGilles AVENARD  MDCEO and Foundergilles.avenard@acticor-biotech.comSophie BINAY  PhDGeneral Manager and CSOSophie.binay@acticor-biotech.comNewCapMathilde BOHINInvestor Relationsacticor@newcap.euT. : +33 (0)1 44 71 94 95NewCapArthur ROUILLÃ‰Media Relationsacticor@newcap.euT. : +33 (0)1 44 71 00 15Source: Acticor Biotech,neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,neutral,0.03,0.95,0.03,True,English,"['Acticor Biotech', 'Total Number', 'Voting Rights', 'Investing.com', 'Disclosure', 'Shares', 'April', 'Arthur ROUILLÃ‰ Media Relations acticor', 'Prof. Mikael KÃ¶hrmann', 'CMS Medical Venture Investment', 'French Financial Markets Authority', 'clinical stage biopharmaceutical company', 'Phase 2b LIBERATE trial', 'European Stroke Organization Conference', '2 other clinical trials', 'Investor Relations acticor', 'clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company', 'French Commercial Code', 'Euronext Growth Paris', 'phase 1b/2a study', 'phase 2/3 study', 'acute ischemic stroke', 'actual voting rights', '2/3 ACTISAVE study', 'international phase', 'ACTICOR BIOTECH', 'BUSINESS WIRE', 'Regulatory News', 'innovative drug', 'cardiovascular emergencies', 'General Regulation', 'Listing Place', 'ISIN Code', 'Web site', 'share capital', 'general meeting', 'Lancet Neurology', 'safety profile', 'intracerebral hemorrhage', 'glenzocimab-treated group', 'post-hoc analysis', 'brain imaging', 'artificial intelligence', 'intracerebral lesions', 'secondary endpoint', 'Principal Investigator', 'opening session', 'complete recanalization', 'mechanical thrombectomy', 'academic teams', 'futility analysis', 'myocardial infarction', 'international investors', 'Mediolanum farmaceutici', 'Go Capital', 'Newton Biocapital', 'HK) Limited', 'A&B', 'Armesa Foundation', 'General Manager', 'Mathilde BOHIN', 'positive results', 'initial results', 'main results', 'final results', 'total number', 'Theoretical number', 'stroke patients', 'primary endpoint', 'severe disability', 'normal life', 'source version', 'thrombectomized patients', 'first 78 patients', 'Article L.', 'Gilles AVENARD', 'Sophie BINAY', 'FR0014005OJ5', 'ALACT', 'treatment', 'shares', 'April', 'Date', 'accordance', 'AMF', 'vote', 'basis', 'ACTIMIS', 'January', 'link', 'publication', 'reduction', 'mortality', '24 hours', 'volume', 'efficacy', 'proportion', 'death', 'mRS', 'May', 'ESOC', 'neutrality', 'trends', 'return', 'sub-populations', 'GREEN', 'inclusion', 'Q4', 'panel', 'Karista', 'Anaxago', 'November', 'businesswire', 'MD', 'CEO', 'Founder', 'PhD', 'CSO', 'acticor-biotech', 'NewCap', 'T.']",2024-05-27,2024-05-28,investing.com

Existing shares will therefore trade ex-right from May 28th  2024.Each existing share will entitle its holder to receive one (1) preferential subscription right. 5 preferential subscription rights will entitle holders to subscribe for 1 new share on an irreducible basis (à titre irréductible)  at a subscription price of €13.0.Subscriptions on a reducible basis (à titre réductible) will be accepted. Any new shares not subscribed on an irreducible basis (à titre irréductible) will be distributed and allocated to the holders of the rights having submitted additional subscription orders on a reducible basis (à titre réductible) subject to reduction in the event of oversubscription.Based on the closing price of Alstom shares on the regulated market of Euronext Paris (“Euronext Paris”) on May 23rd  2024  i.e. €18.22:the theoretical value of 1 preferential subscription right is €0.87 (this value may fluctuate during the rights trading period  in particular depending on changes in Alstom’s share price);the theoretical value of the ex-right share is €17.35;the subscription price for the new shares of €13.0 per share (representing a nominal value of €7 plus an issue premium of €6) reflects a discount of 25.1% to the theoretical ex-right share price and 28.6% to the closing price on May 23rd  2024.These values neither presuppose the preferential subscription right value throughout the rights trading period nor Alstom’s share price ex-rights as they will be observed in the market.The rights issue will be open to the public in France only.Subscription undertakingsEach of Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (“CDPQ”) and Bpifrance Investissement (in respect of shares held through the SLP Lac 1 fund)  currently holding respectively 17.4% and 7.5% of Alstom’s share capital  has undertaken to subscribe for its respective pro-rata share of the capital increase (i.e.  for a total amount of €173.8 million and €75.0 million  respectively).Alstom is not aware of the subscription intentions of any other shareholder.Lock-up agreementsAlstom has agreed to a lock-up period starting on the date of signing of the underwriting agreement and ending 180 calendar days after the settlement and delivery date of the rights issue  subject to certain customary exceptions.Each of CDPQ and Bpifrance Investissement (in respect of shares held through the SLP Lac 1 fund) has agreed to a lock-up period starting on the date of approval by the Autorité des marchés financiers (“AMF”) of the prospectus relating to the rights issue (the “Prospectus”) and ending 180 calendar days after the settlement and delivery date of the rights issue  subject to certain customary exceptions.DilutionFor illustrative purposes only  a shareholder holding 1% of the Alstom’s share capital as of May 24th  2024  and who does not participate in the rights issue  would hold 0.83% following the rights issue (on a non-diluted basis).UnderwritingThe rights issue  to the extent not covered by the subscription undertakings of CDPQ and Bpifrance Investissement  is being underwritten pursuant to an underwriting agreement entered into on May 24th  2024 with a syndicate of banks including BNP Paribas  Crédit Agricole CIB  J.P. Morgan and Société Générale acting as Joint Global Coordinators  Lead Managers and Joint Bookrunners  BofA Securities  Citigroup  Mizuho and Natixis acting as Joint Bookrunners and BBVA  CIC and Deutsche Bank acting as Co-Bookrunners.

Existing shares will therefore trade ex-right from May 28th  2024.Each existing share will entitle its holder to receive one (1) preferential subscription right. 5 preferential subscription rights will entitle holders to subscribe for 1 new share on an irreducible basis (à titre irréductible)  at a subscription price of €13.0.Subscriptions on a reducible basis (à titre réductible) will be accepted. Any new shares not subscribed on an irreducible basis (à titre irréductible) will be distributed and allocated to the holders of the rights having submitted additional subscription orders on a reducible basis (à titre réductible) subject to reduction in the event of oversubscription.Based on the closing price of Alstom shares on the regulated market of Euronext Paris (“Euronext Paris”) on May 23rd  2024  i.e. €18.22:the theoretical value of 1 preferential subscription right is €0.87 (this value may fluctuate during the rights trading period  in particular depending on changes in Alstom’s share price);the theoretical value of the ex-right share is €17.35;the subscription price for the new shares of €13.0 per share (representing a nominal value of €7 plus an issue premium of €6) reflects a discount of 25.1% to the theoretical ex-right share price and 28.6% to the closing price on May 23rd  2024.These values neither presuppose the preferential subscription right value throughout the rights trading period nor Alstom’s share price ex-rights as they will be observed in the market.The rights issue will be open to the public in France only.Subscription undertakingsEach of Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (“CDPQ”) and Bpifrance Investissement (in respect of shares held through the SLP Lac 1 fund)  currently holding respectively 17.4% and 7.5% of Alstom’s share capital  has undertaken to subscribe for its respective pro-rata share of the capital increase (i.e.  for a total amount of €173.8 million and €75.0 million  respectively).Alstom is not aware of the subscription intentions of any other shareholder.Lock-up agreementsAlstom has agreed to a lock-up period starting on the date of signing of the underwriting agreement and ending 180 calendar days after the settlement and delivery date of the rights issue  subject to certain customary exceptions.Each of CDPQ and Bpifrance Investissement (in respect of shares held through the SLP Lac 1 fund) has agreed to a lock-up period starting on the date of approval by the Autorité des marchés financiers (“AMF”) of the prospectus relating to the rights issue (the “Prospectus”) and ending 180 calendar days after the settlement and delivery date of the rights issue  subject to certain customary exceptions.DilutionFor illustrative purposes only  a shareholder holding 1% of the Alstom’s share capital as of May 24th  2024  and who does not participate in the rights issue  would hold 0.83% following the rights issue (on a non-diluted basis).UnderwritingThe rights issue  to the extent not covered by the subscription undertakings of CDPQ and Bpifrance Investissement  is being underwritten pursuant to an underwriting agreement entered into on May 24th  2024 with a syndicate of banks including BNP Paribas  Crédit Agricole CIB  J.P. Morgan and Société Générale acting as Joint Global Coordinators  Lead Managers and Joint Bookrunners  BofA Securities  Citigroup  Mizuho and Natixis acting as Joint Bookrunners and BBVA  CIC and Deutsche Bank acting as Co-Bookrunners.

The company’s oncology-focused pipeline is designed to act on the tumor microenvironment (TME) and the cancer immunity cycle by breaking tumor protection barriers against the immune system and blocking tumor repair. By neutralizing chemokines in the TME  TME Pharma’s approach works in combination with other forms of treatment to weaken tumor defenses and enable greater therapeutic impact. In the GLORIA Phase 1/2 clinical trial  TME Pharma is studying its lead drug candidate NOX-A12 in newly diagnosed brain cancer patients who will not benefit clinically from standard chemotherapy. TME Pharma has delivered top-line data from the NOX-A12 three dose-escalation cohorts combined with radiotherapy of the GLORIA clinical trial  observing consistent tumor reductions and objective tumor responses. Additionally  GLORIA expansion arms evaluate safety and efficacy of NOX-A12 in other combinations where the interim results from the triple combination of NOX-A12  radiotherapy and bevacizumab suggest even deeper and more durable responses  and improved survival. US FDA has approved the design of a randomized Phase 2 trial in glioblastoma and TME Pharma was awarded fast track designation by the FDA for NOX-A12 in combination with radiotherapy and bevacizumab for use in the treatment of the aggressive adult brain cancer  glioblastoma. NOX-A12 in combination with radiotherapy had also previously received orphan drug designation (ODD) for glioblastoma in the United States and glioma in Europe. TME Pharma has delivered final top-line data with encouraging overall survival and safety profile from its NOX-A12 combination trial with Keytruda® in metastatic colorectal and pancreatic cancer patients  which was published in the Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer in October 2021. The company has entered in its second collaboration with MSD/Merck for its Phase 2 study  OPTIMUS  to further evaluate safety and efficacy of NOX-A12 in combination with Merck’s Keytruda® and two different chemotherapy regimens as second-line therapy in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. The design of the trial has been approved in France  Spain and the United States. The company’s second clinical-stage drug candidate  NOX-E36  is designed to target the innate immune system. TME Pharma is considering several solid tumors for further clinical development.

GLORIA further evaluates safety and efficacy of NOX-A12 three additional arms combining NOX-A12 with: A. radiotherapy in patients with complete tumor resection; B. radiotherapy and bevacizumab; and C. radiotherapy and pembrolizumab.About the OPTIMUS StudyOPTIMUS (NCT04901741) is TME Pharma’s planned open-label two-arm Phase 2 study of NOX-A12 combined with pembrolizumab and nanoliposomal irinotecan/5-FU/leucovorin or gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel in microsatellite-stable metastatic pancreatic cancer patients.DisclaimerTranslations of any press release into languages other than English are intended solely as a convenience to the non-English-reading audience.

The country has emerged as a rising star in Europe’s active financial technology (FinTech) sector  attracting a surge of venture capital investment that is fueling the growth of startups seeking to disrupt traditional banking.Riding a $4 billion investment from Microsoft announced on May 14  a series of public-private partnerships and investment-friendly regulation have made France a formidable FinTech destination after years in the digital dark ages. According to PYMNTS author and noted economist David Evans  writing in PYMNTS on April 18  Europe has created relatively few leading digital businesses during the past three decades. “Of the 69 digital businesses worth $10 billion or more as of December 2023  Europe  which accounts for 21% of global GDP  had spawned just five: Spotify  Adyen  Revolut  Adevinta and Checkout.com ” Evans wrote. “Together they account for less than 1% of the total value of the 69 businesses. None is based in Germany  France  Spain or Italy  the four largest EU economies.”Maybe someone in the French government was reading.In 2023  the French FinTech sector experienced a notable shift in its deal activity and funding landscape. The year saw a total of 147 deals completed  marking a 12% decrease compared to 2022. This is much better than the European average which saw a 43% drop over the same period. French FinTech companies collectively secured $1 billion in funding throughout the year  reflecting a significant 79% decline compared to the previous year’s figures. Despite the decrease in overall funding  the average deal size in the French FinTech space remained relatively substantial at $6.8m  a 77% reduction which indicates a major drop in large deals.Ledger  which provides security and infrastructure solutions to critical digital assets  was the largest French FinTech deal in 2023  raising $108m to extend their Series C funding round. The extension round maintained the company’s valuation at €1.3 billion. Led by Pascal Gauthier  Chairman and CEO  Ledger is a global platform for digital assets and Web3  with more than 6 million devices sold to consumers in 200 countries  more than 100 financial institutions and brands as customers  and 20% of the world’s crypto assets secured.This FinTech boom has coincided with efforts by France’s president Emmanuel Macron’s government to boost the country’s startup scene and lure tech talent and capital. Through its La French Tech initiative launched in 2013  France has worked to cut red tape  encourage entrepreneurship  and promote itself as a business-friendly hub.According to the French government quoted in daily newspaper Le Monde  in 2023  France benefited from 1 815 international investment projects  which are expected to maintain 1 391 jobs and create 57 863 new positions over the next three years  surpassing 2022 figures. Investors are likely drawn to reforms aimed at reducing labor costs  cutting corporate tax  and introducing a “green industry tax credit.”Microsoft announced its largest-ever investment in France on May 14  totaling €4 billion. The company plans to expand its cloud and AI infrastructure  bringing up to 25 000 advanced GPUs to the country by 2025. Microsoft will expand its datacenter footprint in Paris  Marseille  and invest in a new datacenter campus in Mulhouse Alsace Agglomération.“With this major project  the Grand Est region is making Alsace a benchmark region for artificial intelligence in France and Europe. This unique project  benefiting from a technological first  will strengthen the competitiveness of our regions and businesses  while guaranteeing the security of their data ” said Franck Leroy  President of the Conseil régional du Grand-Est.Microsoft also commits to upskilling 1 million people in AI by 2027  partnering with government institutions  training services partners  non-profit organizations  and universities to launch new training programs focused on building AI fluency  developing technical skills  supporting business transformation and promoting responsible AI development.Microsoft aims to accelerate 2 500 French startups with AI support through its new flagship program  Microsoft GenAI Studio. This initiative offers a comprehensive package of AI expertise  cloud credits  and collaboration opportunities with customers and partners. Microsoft GenAI Studio will run a tailored 4-month program at STATION F twice a year over three years and expand with a nationwide tour and localized actions to foster connections with regional players.In 2019  France implemented significant regulatory changes for digital assets and initial coin offerings (ICOs). These changes include defining tokens as digital representations of securities  allowing token issuers to obtain optional visas from the Autorité des marchés financiers (AMF) for ICOs  and introducing a framework for a secondary market for digital assets with digital asset service providers. Registration will entail additional requirements such as internal controls  conflict of interest rules  and client communication  reflecting France’s commitment to establishing a comprehensive regulatory framework to promote responsible practices and investor protection in the digital asset and ICO space.Investors and founders say Brexit has also worked to France’s advantage by prompting some FinTech firms and talent to shift from London. Bruno Le Maire  the Minister of the Economy  told LeMonde that his objective is to capitalize on the momentum generated by Brexit and attract an even greater number of jobs  businesses and  most importantly  sustained investment inflows.The French government claims that since the start of 2021  the Parisian financial district has seen an influx of over 5 500 positions in the banking and finance sectors  with the bulk of major English-speaking financial institutions opting to establish their eurozone market operations in the French capital. Stéphane Boujnah  the chief executive officer of Euronext  a prominent stock exchange operator  encapsulated the situation  stating  “While it may not be remarkable when compared to London’s enduring prominence  it is certainly noteworthy when considering Paris’ previous status.”One high-profile French FinTech success story is Lydia  a popular payments app among French Gen Z and millennials.

For acquisition and management commissions linked to sales of insurance policies  net sales comprise current and future commissions issued  acquired by the accounting reporting date  net of cancellations.2 For the digital marketing business  the gross margin represents the total amount of net sales (total invoices issued: fees  commissions and purchases charged back to customers) less the total amount of costs for external purchases made on behalf of customers. It is equal to net sales for the magazine and insurance business lines.3 The scope effect is calculated (i) by eliminating the net sales of companies acquired during the period or the comparable period and (ii) by eliminating the net sales of companies sold during the period or the comparable period. As a result  the like-for-like business does not take into account this scope effect for the period concerned.4 Gross sales volume represents the value of subscriptions sold.Attachment,neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,positive,0.81,0.18,0.01,True,English,"['Dékuple', '2024 FIRST-QUARTER BUSINESS', 'leading advertising strategy consulting agency', 'Le Nouveau Bélier', 'stable family shareholding structure', 'entire magazine press industry', 'The DÉKUPLE Group', 'Digital Marketing gross marg', 'cross-channel data marketing expert', 'quarterly net sales growth', 'The Digital Marketing business', 'digital strategy consulting', 'Solid gross margin growth', 'Artificial Intelligence field', 'Groupe Grand Mercredi', 'supplementary health offering', 'engagement marketing activities', 'stronger value-added services', 'multi-entrepreneur group organization', 'two AI Factories', 'The Marketing Solutions', 'consolidated net sales', 'solid organic growth', 'data marketing solutions', 'Change Digital Marketing', 'Magazine business', 'The Group', 'Consulting services', 'consulting business', 'SOLID GROWTH', 'Marketing Services', 'marketing mix', 'net sales1', 'technological solutions', 'gross margin2', 'Change Consulting', 'support services', 'expert capabilities', 'retail expert', '2024 FIRST-QUARTER BUSINESS', 'sustained growth', 'business acquisitions', 'strong growth', 'business line', 'data issues', 'unique Group', 'Bertrand Laurioz', 'uncertain environment', 'technological assets', 'significant investments', 'new skills', 'general environment', 'commercial investments', 'subscription portfolio', 'European leader', 'long-term vision', 'KEY FIGURES', 'high basis', 'robust trends', 'major player', 'new verticals', 'international focus', 'first quarter', 'continued development', 'international development', 'Insurance business', 'multiple areas', 'ongoing training', 'complementary areas', 'subsidiary Converteo', 'future clients', 'scope effect3', 'Agencies business', 'one year', 'diverse expertise', 'innovation roadmap', 'Paris', '27 May', 'Chairman', 'CEO', '15.8% increase', 'performance', 'relevance', 'ramping', 'strengthening', 'capacity', 'start', 'staff', '50 brands', 'action', 'synergies', 'integration', 'consolidation', 'summer', 'offers', 'view', 'transformation', 'opportunities', 'France', 'team', 'partners', 'Breakdown', 'Q1', 'Magazines', '450 consultants', 'challenges', 'launch', 'current', 'over', '50s', 'July', 'Spain', 'impact', '18.', '0.', '9.', '24.', '25.']",2024-05-27,2024-05-28,globenewswire.com

The company's oncology-focused pipeline is designed to act on the tumor microenvironment (™E) and the cancer immunity cycle by breaking tumor protection barriers against the immune system and blocking tumor repair. By neutralizing chemokines in the ™E  ™E Pharma's approach works in combination with other forms of treatment to weaken tumor defenses and enable greater therapeutic impact. In the GLORIA Phase 1/2 clinical trial  ™E Pharma is studying its lead drug candidate NOX-A12 in newly diagnosed brain cancer patients who will not benefit clinically from standard chemotherapy. ™E Pharma has delivered top-line data from the NOX-A12 three dose-escalation cohorts combined with radiotherapy of the GLORIA clinical trial  observing consistent tumor reductions and objective tumor responses. Additionally  GLORIA expansion arms evaluate safety and efficacy of NOX-A12 in other combinations where the interim results from the triple combination of NOX-A12  radiotherapy and bevacizumab suggest even deeper and more durable responses  and improved survival. US FDA has approved the design of a randomized Phase 2 trial in glioblastoma and ™E Pharma was awarded fast track designation by the FDA for NOX-A12 in combination with radiotherapy and bevacizumab for use in the treatment of the aggressive adult brain cancer  glioblastoma.

The company has entered in its second collaboration with MSD/Merck for its Phase 2 study  OPTIMUS  to further evaluate safety and efficacy of NOX-A12 in combination with Merck's Keytruda ® and two different chemotherapy regimens as second-line therapy in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. The design of the trial has been approved in France  Spain and the United States. The company's second clinical-stage drug candidate  NOX-E36  is designed to target the innate immune system. ™E Pharma is considering several solid tumors for further clinical development.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for Priority Review the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for the investigational use of Sarclisa (isatuximab) in combination with bortezomib  lenalidomide and dexamethasone (VRd) for the treatment of patients with transplant-ineligible newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM). If approved  Sarclisa would be the first anti-CD38 therapy in combination with standard-of-care VRd in newly diagnosed patients not eligible for transplant  which would be the third indication for Sarclisa in multiple myeloma. The target action date for the FDA decision is September 27  2024. A regulatory submission is also under review in the European Union (EU).Dietmar Berger  M.D.  Ph.D.Chief Medical Officer  Global Head of Development at Sanofi“Despite recent advancements in multiple myeloma treatment  there remains a significant unmet need for new frontline therapies  particularly for transplant-ineligible patients who can face poor outcomes from the disease. The filing acceptances  as well as the FDA’s Priority Review designation  reinforce our confidence in Sarclisa as a potential best-in-class treatment and represent a critical step toward advancing this combination in a difficult-to-treat cancer.”The sBLA  as well as the submission in the EU  is based on positive results from the IMROZ phase 3 clinical study evaluating the investigational use of Sarclisa in combination with standard-of-care VRd. In December 2023  the study met its primary endpoint at a planned interim analysis for efficacy  demonstrating statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival (PFS) with Sarclisa in combination with VRd compared with VRd alone in transplant-ineligible patients with NDMM. The safety and tolerability of Sarclisa observed in this study was consistent with the established safety profile of Sarclisa and VRd.The IMROZ study is the fourth phase 3 study investigating Sarclisa combinations in NDMM patients to show superiority versus standard-of-care VRd and KRd  reinforcing its best-in-class potential. Results from the IMROZ study will also be featured during an oral presentation at the 2024 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting and during the plenary scientific session at the 2024 European Hematology Association (EHA) Annual Congress.Priority Review is granted to regulatory applications seeking approval for therapies that have the potential to provide significant improvements in the treatment  diagnosis or prevention of serious conditions.The investigational use of Sarclisa in combination with VRd in patients with transplant-ineligible NDMM is currently under clinical development  and its safety and efficacy for this indication have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About the studyThe global  randomized  multi-center  open-label IMROZ phase 3 clinical study enrolled 446 patients with newly diagnosed  transplant-ineligible MM across 21 countries and 104 centers. During the study  Sarclisa was administered through an intravenous infusion at a dose of 10 mg/kg once weekly for five weeks during first 42-day cycle and once every two weeks in cycles 2 to 4 in combination with subcutaneous bortezomib  oral lenalidomide and intravenous or oral dexamethasone. Then Sarclisa was administered every 2 weeks from cycle 5 to 17 and every 4 weeks in cycles 18+ during 28-day cycles in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone at the standard dose  until disease progression  unacceptable safety profile or patient’s decision to stop the study treatment.The primary endpoint was progression-free survival. Key secondary endpoints include complete response rate  minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity rate for patients with a complete response  very good partial response or better rate  and overall survival. Other secondary endpoints were overall response rate  time to progression  duration of response  time to first response  time to best response  progression-free survival on next line of therapy  progression-free survival by MRD status  sustained MRD negativity greater than or equal to 12 months rate  safety  pharmacokinetic profile  immunogenicity  disease-specific and generic health-related quality of life  disease and treatment-related symptoms  health state utility  and health status.1About SarclisaSarclisa is a monoclonal antibody that binds to a specific epitope on the CD38 receptor on multiple myeloma (MM) cells  inducing distinct antitumor activity. It is designed to work through multiple mechanisms of action including programmed tumor cell death (apoptosis) and immunomodulatory activities. CD38 is highly and uniformly expressed on the surface of MM cells  making it a potential target for antibody-based therapeutics such as Sarclisa.Based on the phase 3 ICARIA-MM study  Sarclisa is approved in >50 countries  including the U.S. and EU  in combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone for the treatment of certain patients with relapsed refractory MM (RRMM) who have received ≥2 prior therapies  including lenalidomide and a proteasome inhibitor and who progressed on last therapy. Based on the phase 3 IKEMA study  Sarclisa is also approved in 50 countries in combination with carfilzomib and dexamethasone  including in the U.S. for the treatment of patients with RRMM who have received 1–3 prior lines of therapy and in the European Union for patients with MM who have received at least 1 prior therapy. In the U.S.  the generic name for Sarclisa is isatuximab-irfc  with irfc as the suffix designated in accordance with Nonproprietary Naming of Biological Products Guidance for Industry issued by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).Sarclisa continues to be evaluated in multiple ongoing phase 3 clinical studies in combination with current standard treatments across the MM treatment continuum. It is also under investigation for the treatment of other hematologic malignancies  and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority outside of its approved indication.For more information on Sarclisa clinical studies  please visit www.clinicaltrials.gov.About multiple myelomaMultiple myeloma (MM) is the second most common hematologic malignancy 2 with more than 180 000 new diagnoses of MM worldwide yearly.3 Despite available treatments  MM remains an incurable malignancy with an estimated 52% five-year survival rate for newly diagnosed patients.4 Since MM does not have a cure  most patients will relapse. Relapsed MM is the term for when the cancer returns after treatment or a period of remission. Refractory MM refers to when the cancer does not respond or no longer responds to therapy.About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people’s lives.

The Plan provides for differentiated treatment of creditors by class. Creditors have been asked to express their vote on the said Plan in front of the Court  with the following main points:The plan does not affect the recent financing provided through the convertible bond facilities.Some obligators are being offered to replace their outstanding loans granted to BioSenic for a total principal amount of EUR 7.5 million with new convertible bonds to be issued by BioSenic. The convertible bonds would be unsecured and would have a maturity date of 31 December 2030  which could be further extended to 21 December 2032 by BioSenic for up to 24 months depending on its cash balance. An interest rate of 5% per year  payable annually  with an additional non-compounding interest of 3% per year  is added to the principal amount upon conversion or repayment of a convertible bond. Under the judgement  200 000 outstanding warrants will be cancelled; the plan removes the conditions precedent previously agreed.The plan provides that an outstanding EUR 8 million principal loan will be replaced by new convertible bonds to be issued by BioSenic. The convertible bonds are unsecured and have a maturity date of 31 December 2030  which could be further extended by BioSenic for up to 24 months depending on its cash balance. An interest rate of 5% per year  payable annually  with an additional non-compounding interest of 3% per year will be added to the principal amount upon conversion or repayment of a convertible bond; 800 000 outstanding warrants are also cancelled.Regarding the ordinary creditors  the plan provides for a payment by BioSenic of 5% of each accepted claim on the last day of the 5th year of the plan.Regarding the strategic creditors  the plan provides for 90% over 5 years depending on cash inflows and no later than the last day of the 5 th year of the plan.year of the plan. For the accessory employees  the plan provides for 99% immediately.The plan provides  for the very useful creditors  for 50% within 2 years.Regarding the InterCo debts  the plan provides for 5% immediately.Finally  with regard to the shareholders/ Board members  the plan provides for the allocation of warrants  immediately available for sale.The plan includes participation clause at the restructuring value  payable on the last day of the fifth year following approval of the plan  based on the average share price over the preceding 90 days. This participation amount - to be deducted from the Company's own financing capacity for projects in the 5th year  with trials on new indications to be initiated or even maintained - will be due on the last day of the 5th year following the approval of the plan (27 May 2024) and will be assessed on the basis of the average share price over the preceding 90 days: the average share price will have to reach the level observed for the BioSenic share in 2017 while a Phase 3 trial was ongoing (JTA004). At that time  the share price stood at EUR 10. If this level is reached  the participation of every creditor will be increased by 10% of the debt written off. The increase/participation could reach 20 % of the debt written off if the price reaches EUR 18  30% if the price reaches EUR 25 and 50% if the price reaches EUR 50  which is deemed highly unlikely for a biotech with no turnover  as indicated in a 2022 MIT study (Singh et al 2022  PloS-ONE  open access article  ""The reaction of sponsor stock prices to clinical trial outcomes: An event study analysis"").The plan is based on the maintained non-binding offer of funding from a fund to finance a Phase 3 clinical trial on chronic Graft versus Host disease (as announced by BioSenic press release  on 8 December 2023). The court judgment is currently under deliberation. Once the decision is made public  the plan can be implemented immediately and will significantly reduce current debt and provide a good opportunity for BioSenic to continue operations  resolve remaining issues and resolutely focus all active forces on the path to success in the clinical challenges facing the company.François Rieger  PhD  President of the Board and CEO of the BioSenic Group  said: ""The continued reorganisation of BioSenic's assets is now being accompanied by a creditors' vote that will allow significant adjustments to the company's liabilities. Once the court's decision is final  this should enable our biotech to regain essential momentum by focusing its efforts on its most promising projects  in particular a phase 3 clinical trial for the treatment of chronic Graft-versus-Host disease. These projects  most of which are at a crucial and late stage of clinical development  should quickly generate value for all those who have invested financially in the adventure that is now taking shape. Our aim is to deliver breakthrough results for patients suffering from chronic diseases of the immune system for which there is currently no medical need  and to develop our therapeutic tools for the benefit of patients with high medical expectations.""About BioSenicBioSenic is a leading biotech company specializing in the development of clinical assets issued from its Medsenic’s arsenic trioxide (ATO) platform. Key target indications for the autoimmune platform include graft-versus-host-disease (GvHD)  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  and now systemic sclerosis (SSc).Following the merger in October 2022  BioSenic combined the strategic positionings and strengths of Medsenic and Bone Therapeutics. The merger specifically enables Medsenic/Biosenic to develop an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/oral ATO (OATO).BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About the main Medsenic/BioSenic technology platformThe ATO platform provides derived active products with immunomodulatory properties and fundamental effects on the activated cells of the immune system. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. cGvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT).Medsenic has been successful in a phase 2 trial with its intravenous formulation  Arscimed®  which has orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA. The company is heading towards an international phase 3 confirmatory study  with its new  IP-protected  OATO formulation. Another selected target is moderate-to-severe forms of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae  and the gastrointestinal tract). Systemic sclerosis is now full part of the clinical pipeline of Medsenic/BioSenic. This serious chronic disease badly affects skin  lungs  or vascularization  and has no current effective treatment. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive  giving good grounds to launch a phase 2 clinical protocol  using new immunomodulatory formulations of APIs recognized to be active on the immune system.The company is currently focusing its present R&D and clinical activities on a selective  accelerated development of its autoimmune platform.Note: The allogeneic cell therapy platform-originating from the previous listed company Bone Therapeutics company  may be of renewed interest by using isolated and purified differentiated bone marrow Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) as a starting material for further isolation of passive or active biological subcellular elements. Indeed  these cells may provide new subcellular vesicles potentially able to deliver a unique and proprietary approach to organ repair. BioSenic is now involved in determining new patentable approaches in this complex area of cell therapy.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAFrançois Rieger  PhD  CEOTel: +33 (0)671 73 31 59investorrelations@biosenic.comCertain statements  beliefs and opinions in this press release are forward-looking  which reflect the company or  as appropriate  the company directors’ current expectations and projections about future events.

(Euronext Paris: QDT)  a leader in business solutions for meaningful customer connections through digital and physical channels  today announces its 2024 first-quarter consolidated sales (period ended on 30 April 2024).Geoffrey Godet  Chief Executive Officer of Quadient S.A.  stated: “2024 is off to a positive start for Quadient  in line with our expectations  with a solid 3.2% reported revenue growth for the first quarter. Revenue growth was driven by the positive performance from Intelligent Communication Automation  with a strong acceleration of its annual recurring revenue (ARR(2))  reaching a new high at €215 million and a 17% organic(3) growth on an annualized basis compared to the end of full-year 2023. Our Mail-Related Solutions continue to show strong resilience and outperformed market trends with another quarter of very limited decline  while Parcel Locker Solutions revenue remains impacted by the evolution of our commercial agreement towards volume-based revenue for Yamato. However  the increase in volumes both for the drop off and the pick-up of parcels is strong and confirms the steady deployment of our new open networks in UK and France. Finally  our recent acquisitions  Frama and Daylight  are also contributing to overall revenue growth and their integrations are progressing well.We remain confident in our ability to deliver positive organic growth in revenue and in current EBIT before acquisition-related expenses for the full-year and are looking forward to sharing more details on our medium-term outlook during our Capital Markets Day scheduled for the 19 June 2024.”Q1 2024 performancesGroup sales came in at €261 million in Q1 2024  a 3.2% increase on a reported basis  and 1.0% organic growth compared to Q1 2023 in line with Quadient’s expectations. The reported growth includes an almost flat currency impact and a positive scope effect of €6 million  which is related to the acquisition of Daylight in September 2023 and the acquisition of Frama in February 2024.Q1 2024 consolidated salesIn € million Q1 2024 Q1 2023(a) Change Organic change Intelligent Communication Automation 64 58 +8.5% +6.0% Mail-Related Solutions 178 174 +2.5% (0.2)% Parcel Locker Solutions 20 21 (6.3)% (3.4)% Group total 261 253 +3.2% +1.0% (a) The full-year 2023 financial statements published in March 2024 reflected Quadient’s decision to review the future of its Mail activity in Italy with a view to divest this subsidiary within the next 12 months. As this was the case in the full-year 2023 statements  Q1 2023 revenue from the afore-mentioned subsidiary is not represented in the consolidated revenue of the Group as it is recorded as discontinued operations. This is still the case in Q1 2024.Intelligent Communication AutomationIn Q1 2024  sales from Intelligent Communication Automation reached €64 million  up 6.0% organically and up 8.5% on a reported basis (including the contribution from Daylight) compared to Q1 2023. Importantly  growth for the Solution was still impacted by the delay in the further implementation of two large contracts  announced in Q3 2023.At the end of Q1 2024  annual recurring revenue (ARR(2))  which is a forward-looking indicator of future subscription-related revenue  reached €215 million  up from €206 million at the end of full-year 2023  representing a 17% organic(3) growth on an annualized basis compared to the end of FY 2023. Booking trends were solid in the quarter for both communication automation and financial automation modules with cross-selling from Mail-Related Solutions customers representing close to 30% of total bookings over the period.Throughout Q1 2024  Intelligent Communication Automation experienced positive trends in terms of customer acquisitions. For instance over 700 new small and mid-size customers were added to the base in the quarter. In addition  Quadient signed several multi-year subscription deals with large US health insurance companies representing a total amount of €4.5 million  including one large three-year contract averaging €1million subscription-related revenue per annum. This is a further recognition of the quality of Quadient’s Customer Communication Management offering for large and complex business needs.Quadient Hub customers onboarding to its cloud platform is now nearing completion  at a level of 88% at the end of Q1 2024. This goes along with the successful up-selling of financial automation modules with several platform deals combining both accounts receivable and accounts payable.In Q1 2024  subscription-related revenue recorded a strong 9.0% organic growth  now representing 82% of Intelligent Communication Automation total sales  a further increase compared to 80% in Q1 2023. The share of SaaS customers also stands at 82% at the end of Q1 2024.The change in business model from on-premise licenses to SaaS and the lower requirements for installation and support services continue to drive the decline in professional services and license sales  which  together  are now representing only 18% of total revenue.Mail-Related SolutionsMail-Related Solutions sales reached €178 million in Q1 2024  down only 0.2% on an organic basis. The reported growth stood at +2.5%  including the contribution of Frama. The integration of Frama is progressing well  and the focus is now set on upgrading its installed base and initiating cross-selling efforts.Hardware sales recorded a 4.1% organic growth in Q1 2024  with positive contributions not just from North America but also France and International. The focus on investing into renewing the products offering continues to support solid product placements  as seen in the further increase in the share of the upgraded installed base  reaching 33.8% at the end of Q1 2024 vs. 31.5% at the end of FY 2023.Subscription-related revenue (69% of Mail-Related Solution sales) recorded a limited 2.0% organic decline in Q1 2024  supported both by robust rental product placements and the positive impact on recurring revenue of recent good performance in hardware sales.Cross-selling of Intelligent Communication Automation solutions continues at a sustained pace bringing close to 30% of Intelligent Communication Automation bookings in value as mentioned previously.Parcel Locker SolutionsParcel Locker Solutions sales reached €20 million in Q1 2024  a 3.4% decrease on an organic basis and a 6.3% decrease on a reported basis compared to Q1 2023.Subscription-related revenue was up 2.8% organically in Q1 2024  benefiting from the deployment of the UK open network  as well as the contribution of the existing installed base  supported by the higher number of carriers committed to use Quadient’s open networks. However  the increased focus towards a usage-based model is still impacting subscription-related revenue (change in commercial agreements with Yamato in Japan in Q3 2023. The global usage rate of the platform remained solid  standing at 58% in Q1 2024. Overall  subscription-related revenue stood at 68% of total revenue in Q1 2024  up from 65% in Q1 2023.License and hardware sales were down 20.2% organically in Q1 2024. Hardware sales were impacted by lower installations in North America.Quadient’s global locker installed base reached c.20 800 units at the end of Q1 2024 vs. c.20 200 units at the end of FY 2023. This is reflecting an acceleration in the pace of installation of new lockers  notably in the UK  fueled by the partnerships signed by Quadient to host parcel lockers in new suitable locations.Debt maturities managementTo anticipate the refinancing of the residual amount of its 5-year 2.25% bond(4) maturing in early 2025  Quadient raised:€140 million through a Schuldschein. The private placement was in euros for €117.5 million and United States dollars for 26 million  with maturities spread between 3 and 7 years;€15 million  through loans signed with Bpifrance. The maturities of the tranches are 4 and 7 years.FY 2024 guidance unchangedQuadient confirms its FY 2024 financial guidance of organic growth both at the revenue and current EBIT before acquisition-related expenses levels.With Q1 2024 organic sales growth in line with expectations  and solid booking trends over the quarter  Quadient had a positive start to the year. In addition  H2 2024 will benefit from an easier comparison basis for both Intelligent Communication Automation and Parcel Locker Solutions as there will no longer be any negative impact neither from the delay in implementation of the two large SaaS contracts  nor from the change in commercial agreement with Yamato  which took place at the beginning of H2 2023.Additional financial guidance  three-year strategic focus and trajectory for the Group will be discussed at Quadient’s Capital Markets Day planned for 19 June 2024.Q1 2024 business highlightQuadient confirms its eligibility for PEA-PME schemeOn 2 April 2024  Quadient announced its eligibility for the PEA-PME scheme  as it complies with the criteria for inclusion set by Article L.221-32-2 of the French Monetary and Financial Code.First ‘Quadient Connects’ Virtual Conference Will Help Organizations Be More Innovative and Accelerate their Digital TransformationOn 15 April 2024  Quadient announced that it will be hosting the first-of-its-kind Quadient Connects virtual conference on May 15  2024  bringing together business leaders and other decision makers from organizations of all sizes including those from its community of over 400 000 customers.Drupa 2024: Quadient to Showcase Newest  Most Advanced Cloud Software  Mailing and Shipping SolutionsOn 25 April 2024  Quadient announced it will showcase its newest  most advanced mailing and shipping systems  combined with powerful software and the latest technology in direct printing at Drupa 2024  one of the world’s largest trade fairs for the mailing and shipping industry.

We also invite investors to join us at the end of the year for a Capital Markets Day  which will provide an overview of Aramis Group's business model  its competitive advantages  and an update on its strategy and medium- and long-term outlook.""2024 FIRST-HALF ACTIVITYOverview of volumes and revenues2024 first-half B2C volumesIn units Reported basis H1 2024 H1 2023 Change (%) Refurbished cars 42 362 38 579 +9.8% Pre-registered cars 12 867 5 413 +137.7% Total B2C volumes 55 229 43 992 +25.5%2024 first-half revenuesBy segmentIn million of euros Reported basis H1 2024 H1 2023 Change (%) Refurbished cars 731.4 681.0 +7.4% Pre-registered cars 233.4 102.3 +128.3% Total B2C 964.9 783.3 +23.2% Total B2B 76.4 106.0 -27.9% Total services 57.0 51.4 +10.9% Revenues 1 098.3 940.8 +16.7%By countryIn million of euros Reported basis H1 2024 H1 2023 Change (%) France 477.8 387.0 +23.5% Belgium 139.2 120.8 +15.2% Spain 150.5 182.1 -17.4% United Kingdom 213.8 177.6 +20.4% Austria 103.5 68.1 +52.0% Italy 13.6 5.1 +164.7% Revenues 1 098.3 940.8 +16.7%Analysis of the change in revenues by segmentB2C – sales of cars to private customers (88% of revenues)Revenues for the B2C segment – corresponding to sales of refurbished and pre-registered cars to private customers – came to €964.9 million for the first half of 2024  up +23.2% from the first half of 2023  including a volume effect of +25.5%. Leveraging its know-how  its management of all sourcing channels and in particular its unique network of suppliers  Aramis Group has succeeded in taking full advantage of the ongoing normalization of conditions in the automotive market  especially the increasing availability of used vehicles  both recent and pre-registered.Revenues for the refurbished cars segment totaled €731.4 million  up +7.4%  including a volume effect of +9.8% and a price effect of -2.2%. A total of 42 362 vehicles were delivered during the period. This is a solid performance at a time when – for those countries that offer them – the increased supply of pre-registered vehicles has affected sales of the latest refurbished vehicles.Revenues for the pre-registered cars segment came to €233.4 million  a jump of +128.3% from the first half of 2023  including a volume effect of +137.7%. A total of 12 867 vehicles were delivered during the period  almost equaling the number of deliveries made throughout the entire 2023 financial year.In a used car market for vehicles less than 8 years old4  which has begun to rebound in 5 of its 6 geographies (with an average increase of +1.6%5 over the period despite a c. -9% decline in the UK)  Aramis Group once again demonstrates the quality of its value proposition. The Group continues to gain market share  outperforming the market by 24 points in the first half of 2024.B2B – sales of cars to professional customers (7% of revenues)Revenues for the B2B segment totaled €76.4 million during the first half of 2024  down -27.9% compared with the first half of 2023. The decline in this activity reflects the reduction in Aramis Group's sourcing of used vehicles from private owners  some of which are resold B2B (mainly vehicles over eight years old or 150 000 km). The Group seized more opportunities this half with its professional suppliers.Services (5% of revenues)Services generated €57.0 million of revenues during the first half of 2024  up +10.9% compared with the first half of 2023. After several months eroding due to rising interest rates  the penetration rate of Aramis Group’s financing solutions stabilized at around 40%.Analysis of the change in revenues by countryRevenues generated in France in the first half of 2024 grew by +23.5%. Total volumes increased by around +37%  largely owing to the uptick in pre-registered vehicle sales. For reference  the French market6 recorded growth of around +7% in volume over the same period.Revenues generated in the United Kingdom were up +20.4%. The volumes sold increased by around +21% in the first half  reflecting strong outperformance in a market that contracted by around -9%. In an extremely complex market with a negative volume and price trend (prices fell by -16% between the end of September 2023 and the end of March 2024)  the teams at CarSupermarket.com – the UK subsidiary of Aramis Group – showed considerable agility in adapting their offering to counteract the cyclical downturn in demand  as well as disciplined inventory management.In Spain  revenues fell by -17.4%  including a volume effect of around -10%. This is due to the transition that has been under way for several quarters at Clicars  the Spanish subsidiary of Aramis Group. The transition involves various aspects of its operations (including an overhaul of its refurbishing processes and adaptation of its offering) with a view to returning to sustainable growth. The fall in volumes recorded throughout the first half of 2024 masks an underlying improvement in activity over the months  resulting in both higher volumes and improved profit per unit. This trend is set to continue in the second half of the year  which is already on track for positive and profitable growth.In Belgium  revenues grew by +15.2%  in line with the market trend.In Austria  revenues jumped by +52.0% compared with the first half of 2023. The volumes sold rose by around +69%  outperforming the Austrian market that grew by around +12% over the same period.In Italy  sales continued to grow  with revenues for the first half of 2024 totaling €13.6 million  up +164.7%.INCOME STATEMENTCondensed income statement 7In million of euros Reported basis H1 2024 H1 2023 Change (%) Revenues 1 098.3 940.8 +16.7% Gross margin 118.9 95.3 +24.8% Gross profit per B2C vehicle sold - GPU (€) 2 153 2 166 -0.6% Adjusted EBITDA 16.2 1.0 +1 532.7% Operating income (loss) (7.7) (7.8) -1.8% Operating income (before the gain on a bargain purchase linked to Brumbrum acquisition) (7.7) (22.8) -66.3% Net profit (loss) (13.3) (12.6) +6.0% Net profit (before the gain on a bargain purchase linked to Brumbrum acquisition) (13.3) (27.6) -51.7%Gross profitFor the first half of 2024  gross profit came to €118.9 million  a rise of +24.8% compared with the first half of 2023. Gross profit per unit (GPU)  i.e. per B2C vehicle sold  was €2 153  once again the highest in Europe for listed players.Aramis Group has managed to maintain this high level of GPU despite the erosion of the contribution from its ""Services"" component8  affected by rising interest rates  particularly in Spain and the United Kingdom. In the United Kingdom  the ""Metal"" component9 of GPU has also come under pressure in recent months owing to the sharp correction in used vehicle prices in the UK market since last September.These external conjunctural effects were offset by the significant work carried out  in all geographies of the Group  to improve the profit margins on vehicles sold. This included the optimization of refurbishing and logistics costs and continued efforts by the teams to refine the selection and pricing of vehicles offered to customers  thanks to the technological tools and data of Aramis Group.Adjusted EBITDAAdjusted EBITDA stood at €16.2 million in the first half of 2024  compared to €1 million the previous year and €9.6 million for the entire year of 2023. Aramis Group's profitability is continuing to recover sharply  with the adjusted EBITDA generated in the entire 2023 financial year nearly doubling in just the first half of 2024.While the solid level of growth and GPU achieved over the period have undoubtedly given Aramis Group renewed momentum  a strong discipline was also maintained in the management of selling  general and administrative (SG&A) expenses. These totaled €102.7 million for the first half of 2024  a moderate increase of +8.9% compared with the first half of 2023  despite the +25.5% rise in volumes over the period.The efficiency of marketing spend has once again improved  optimizing the cost while continuing to grow sales. These stood at €16.7 million  down -11.2% in unit cost terms (COCA). The personnel expenses recognized under SG&A amounted to €52.5 million  a relatively modest increase of +8.3% given the salary inflation and expansion of some sales teams to support the growth of the business. Vehicle delivery costs came to €15.0 million  up +21.3% in absolute value and therefore an improvement of -3.4% in unit cost terms. Lastly  other SG&A  which include overheads and head office costs  were virtually unchanged at €18.5 million.Operating income (loss)Operating income (loss) for the first half of 2024 totaled -€7.7 million  compared with -€22.8 million in the first half of 2023 (excluding the impact of badwill related to the Brumbrum acquisition)  reflecting the solid performance of the Group in the first half of 2024. As a reminder  operating income (loss) for the first half of 2023 included income in the form of a fair value surplus (badwill) of +€15.0 million  following the purchase of the Group's Italian subsidiary for a nominal price in late October 2022.In more detail  operating income (loss) for the first half of 2024 includes -€6.4 million of personnel expenses related to acquisitions (corresponding to the progressive recognition in the consolidated income statement of future earn-out payments for the acquisition of the UK and Austrian subsidiaries)  -€1.2 million of personnel expenses related to share-based payments  -€0.4 million of restructuring costs  and -€15.9 million of depreciation and amortization expenses (of which -€7.2 million under IFRS 16).Net income (loss)Net income (loss) for the first half of 2024 was -€13.3 million  compared with -€12.6 million in the first half of 2023 (same impact of badwill to be taken into account as for operating income (loss)  to allow an effective year-on-year comparison).It includes -€5.5 million of net financial income (expense)  of which -€3.1 million for the cost of net financial debt  -€2.2 million of financial expenses on lease liabilities (IFRS 16) and -€0.2 million of other net financial expenses.CASH FLOW AND FINANCIAL STRUCTUREInventories and operating working capital requirementsIn million of euros Reported basis Mar 31  2024 Sep 30  2023 Change (€mn) Mar 31  2023 Inventories 226.9 220.3 +6.6 246.0 Trade receivables 51.4 39.0 +12.5 35.4 Other current assets (excl. non-operational items) 38.8 30.1 +8.7 34.8 Trade payables 91.1 78.3 +12.8 56.6 Other current liabilities (excl. non-operational items) 67.2 44.2 +23.0 61.2 Other items 2.5 2.6 -0.0 2.8 Operating working capital requirements 156.3 164.4 -8.1 195.7 In days of revenues 27 31 - 37Inventories stood at €226.9 million at March 31  2024  a modest increase of +€6.6 million from September 30  2023  but down -€19.1 million from March 31  2023. This was despite the growth in the volumes of +25.5% in the first half of 2024. These figures are evidence of how well Aramis Group manages its inventories. The Group has continued its efforts to accelerate turnover across all its geographies  enabling it to secure its GPU levels and optimize the use of its capital.Operating working capital requirement stood at €156.3 million  down -€8.1 million compared with September 30  2023 and -€39.4 million compared with March 31  2023. It represented 27 days of revenues at March 31  2024  a significant improvement of 4 days compared with September 30  2023 and 10 days compared with March 31  2023.Cash positionIn million of euros Reported basis Mar 31  2024 Mar 31  2023 Net debt at opening 82.3 18.4 Adjusted EBITDA +16.2 +1.0 Change in operating working capital requirement +8.1 -0.6 Disbursement of personnel liabilities related to acquisitions -1.0 -1.6 Other transaction-related cash flow -1.5 -5.4 Subtotal of cash flow from transactions +21.7 -6.6 Capex -6.8 -10.2 Acquisitions of subsidiaries (excl. fees) - -27.2 Other investment-related cash flow +0.9 +0.5 Sub-total of cash flow from investing activities -5.9 -36.8 Interest paid -2.4 -1.3 Lease charges (IFRS 16 - interest and capital) -7.8 -8.2 Other financing-related cash flow(excl. issuing and repayment of borrowings) +0.1 -1.9 Sub-total of cash flow from financing activities -10.1 -11.3 Other financing-related cash flow without any impact on cash - -37.0 Net debt at closing 76.7 110.1Net debt stood at €76.7 million at March 31  2024  compared with €82.3 million at the end of September 2023 and €110.1 million at the end of March 2023. This represented positive cash generation of almost €6 million in the first half of 2024 and almost €34 million over the last 12 months.Cash generation from operations during the period amounted to +€21.7 million  compared with consumption of -€6.6 million in the first half of 2023. This was essentially driven by the contribution from positive adjusted EBITDA and the decrease in operating working capital requirement  as described previously.Cash consumption related to investments totaled -€5.9 million  versus -€36.8 million last year taking into account the acquisition of the two subsidiaries in Austria and Italy. Capex in the first half of 2024 amounted to -€6.8 million  i.e. 0.6% of revenues for the period. The Group optimized the budget for its digital ecosystem and did not invest in new refurbishing centers during the period  its current facilities having the potential for additional capacity.Cash consumption related to financing amounted to -€10.1 million  compared with -€11.3 million in the first half of 2023. These cash flows are mainly composed of IFRS 16 lease liabilities and interest paid during the period.Aramis Group thus continues to enjoy a solid balance sheet position. At March 31  2024  the Group has €169 million of equity and €201 million of undrawn credit facilities without financial covenants  including 71% with its majority shareholder  the Stellantis Group.OUTLOOKThe used car market began to rebound in the first half of 2024 across most European regions. The impact of normalizing new vehicle production on the balances of the used car market is evident  firstly  in a relaxation of professional supply channels and a continuation of the general downward trend in car prices  and secondly  in an upward shift in household demand.In this market that is gradually returning to traditional functioning  Aramis Group approaches the future with confidence and ambition. The Group capitalizes on its ability to quickly identify  acquire  and process vehicles under competitive conditions  providing an unmatched value proposition to its customers.In the second half of 2024  the Group will continue to leverage its unique business model for profitable growth. Volume growth is expected to remain high  and rigorous discipline will be maintained in cost and inventory management. Aramis Group is revising its 2024 full-year guidance upwards  now expecting:volumes of B2C vehicles sold to exceed 110 000 units (vs. exceed 100 000 units previously) at constant perimeter;adjusted EBITDA to exceed €32 million (vs exceed €19 million previously).The Group will hold a Capital Markets Day on the upcoming November 27  2024.This event will provide an overview of Aramis Group's business model  its competitive advantages  as well as an update on its medium- and long-term strategy and outlook. It will also allow participants to better understand its technology  organizational processes  and unique corporate culture  all of which are key elements of its value creation and contribute to its profile of profitable and sustainable growth.***Status of the statutory auditors’ procedures:During its meeting on May 27  2024  Aramis Group's Board of Directors approved the consolidated financial statements for the first half of financial year 2024  ended March 31  2024.

The technology is an extension of Wolters Kluwer’s Capital Changes product functionality and is purpose-built to address a new  automation-focused mandate for brokers from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that takes effect May 28  2024.Referred to as T+1  the new mandate shortens the standard settlement cycle for most routine securities trades on U.S. securities exchanges from two business days after the trade date of a securities transaction to one day.T+1 accelerates the need for corporate action resolution and communication across various internal systems because all corporate actions affecting securities need to be processed before any related trades can be settled and includes important tax details.“Tax accuracy is paramount for our customers ” says Chuck Ross  Vice President and Segment Leader  Investment Compliance  Wolters Kluwer Compliance Solutions. “The move to a shorter settlement turnaround time as reflected in the T+1 rule presents significant challenges to brokers and requires the kind of nimble  robust automation functionality that Cap DATA NOW provides to help market participants comply.”Exchanges in Canada and Mexico have also adopted this requirement  effective May 27  2024.Ross notes that the T+1 settlement cycle requirement will require brokers to automate operations processes in many respects  including corporate actions and their tax details.Cap DATA NOW provides corporate action taxability information for publicly traded stocks as well as useful early announcement information. Because it is XML structured data  the solution’s output helps brokers process corporate actions tax details quickly in the new T+1 world.

An exclusivity agreement has been reached with the Port of Tyne which will open the door to talks about securing a long lease for the location  which has a deep water berth on the river.LS Eco Advanced Cables says it is aiming to secure planning permission by the end of the year  with hopes the facility could start production in 2027. The alliance says the plant will feed the growing green energy market  providing high voltage direct current (HVDC) cables for electricity transmission for wind and solar farms.Read more: Pragmatic Semiconductor points to progress as losses widen amid significant investmentRead more: Electric powertrain specialist Saietta failed with deficit of £2.89m  administrators sayIn an announcement to investors on the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange  where Global InterConnection Group is listed  it said it had progressed design specifications for the factory and had enlisted ""strong national and local government support for the project"". The joint venture needs to raise £923m to fund the factory’s construction with an offer to (GIG) shareholders on a first refusal basis.Bosses say the demand for HVDC cables will escalate in coming years thanks to growth in the renewables market  electricity consumption more widely  and emphasis on energy security in national and international policy. They cite research from Goldman Sachs which suggests $128bn of investment is needed up to 2030 to service the demand.Global InterConnection Group is the holding company of Atlantic SuperConnection (ASC)- the business which is developing a 1 794MW  1 708km interconnector between Iceland and the UK  with a national grid connection near Hull. The cable will bring geothermal and hydroelectric electricity to the UK  and take offshore wind power to the existing Icelandic hydro dams  with pumped storage ‘refuelling’ the dams to create a 1 500 MW ‘clean battery’.ASC hopes to raise £1.2bn of equity funding towards the project  with an initial £30m investment being made to bring it to a final investment decision before construction can start. But the business will first need to raise £3.5bn  with indications it has the support of an investment bank.In a message to shareholders  Global InterConnection Group said: ""The new factory will deliver a substantial positive impact both environmentally and socially. LS Eco Advanced Cables intends to secure planning permission by the end of this year  with fully CIGRE-certified production expected in 2027.""By providing the high-voltage cables to deliver dependable zero carbon energy  LS Eco Advanced Cables will help address the electricity supply volatility from growing dependence on wind and solar; reduce the UK’s dependence on fossil fuels for peaking power; enhance energy security and reduce energy prices for UK consumers and businesses alike. HVDC cables reduce electricity transmission losses by at least 15% over even relatively short 150km cable lengths  compared to AC power cables.""",neutral,0.01,0.98,0.0,mixed,0.17,0.22,0.62,True,English,"['British-Korean joint venture', '£923m cable factory', 'Tyneside', 'high voltage direct current (HVDC) cables', '11.7 hectare Tyne Renewable Quay site', 'Electric powertrain specialist Saietta', 'Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange', 'high voltage cable plant', 'LS Eco Advanced Cables', 'short 150km cable lengths', 'dependable zero carbon energy', 'existing Icelandic hydro dams', 'UK-based Global InterConnection Group', 'growing green energy market', 'offshore cable companies', 'deep water berth', 'first refusal basis', '1,794MW, 1,708km interconnector', '1,500 MW ‘clean battery', 'substantial positive impact', 'AC power cables', 'electricity supply volatility', 'initial £30m investment', 'final investment decision', 'latest business news', 'local government support', 'national grid connection', 'offshore wind power', 'electricity transmission losses', 'HVDC cables', 'LS Group', 'high-voltage cables', 'renewables market', 'energy security', 'energy prices', 'growing dependence', 'electricity consumption', 'hydroelectric electricity', 'significant investment', 'investment bank', 'Invalid email', 'North East', 'Korean firm', 'joint venture', 'south bank', 'exclusivity agreement', 'long lease', 'planning permission', 'Pragmatic Semiconductor', 'design specifications', 'strong national', 'coming years', 'international policy', 'Goldman Sachs', 'holding company', 'Atlantic SuperConnection', 'equity funding', 'fossil fuels', 'international alliance', '£923m factory', 'solar farms', 'new factory', 'CIGRE-certified production', 'UK consumers', 'Something', 'inbox', 'plans', 'Tyneside', 'GIG', 'subsidiary', 'bid', 'door', 'talks', 'location', 'river', 'hopes', 'facility', 'deficit', 'administrators', 'announcement', 'investors', 'project', 'construction', 'offer', 'shareholders', 'Bosses', 'demand', 'growth', 'emphasis', 'research', 'ASC', 'Hull', 'geothermal', 'storage', 'indications', 'message', 'peaking', 'businesses']",2024-05-28,2024-05-28,business-live.co.uk
