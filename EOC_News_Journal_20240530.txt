However  progress on institutional adoption has reached an inflection point as firms continue innovating in silos  with small-scale initiatives that fail to progress or prioritize broad ecosystem development. The paper  “Building the Digital Asset Ecosystem ” looks to shift the industry’s focus by defining six principles to promote the successful adoption of tokenization and digital asset securities (excluding cryptocurrencies). It also details a comprehensive set of risk management controls to underpin the future of digital markets.The six principles are intended to serve as a roadmap for the industry to come together and develop comprehensive standards for the digital asset marketplace. They include:Legal Certainty – ensuring operations comply with law Regulatory Compliance – encouraging alignment with regulatory frameworks Resilience and Security – developing robust infrastructure capable of resisting disruptions while protecting sensitive data Safeguarding Customer Assets – implementing governance via smart contracts to manage assets securely Connectivity and Interoperability – facilitating transactions and flexible settlements across diverse networks Operational Scalability – striving for efficiency and cost-effectiveness through standardization.“While many firms recognize that blockchain holds enormous promise to deliver cost savings  capital efficiencies and reduced risk  the industry needs to pivot and demonstrate tangible results and value generation ” said Nadine Chakar  Managing Director  Global Head of DTCC Digital Assets. “We have a unique opportunity to transform the financial system  but it will require collaboration across a wide cross section of firms to build the infrastructure  standards  controls and governance to underpin digital markets. We are proud to lead this conversation and will use this paper as a springboard to build consensus and drive efforts forward.”“New technologies bear immense potential to bring financial markets to the next level of efficiency  speed and safety ” said Jens Hachmeister  Managing Director  Head of Issuer Services & New Digital Markets at Clearstream. “To make this evolution a sustainable one  we need industry-wide collaboration and unified standards to overcome current challenges and drive the seamless integration of digital assets in the global financial ecosystem. As financial market infrastructures  we are developing the foundation for future digital markets for the benefit of our clients and all market participants.”“Through a true collaborative effort  we have developed a plan to demonstrate the potential of digital assets ” said Philippe Laurensy  Managing Director and Head of Product  Strategy & Innovation  Euroclear. “Our objective is to create innovative solutions that will address the evolving needs of our customers and drive industry advancements which includes clients having the flexibility to create space on their balance sheets through tokenisation  therefore leading to new business opportunities. This collaboration is a testament to our commitment to innovation  and we look forward to the exciting opportunities that lie ahead and the positive impacts to be made for our clients and the global market.”The partnership between DTCC  Clearstream  and Euroclear draws on decades of shared experience providing infrastructure for global capital markets  as well as a vast network of client relationships  and a strong track record of supporting market evolution. The latest paper builds upon efforts by the FMIs last year to galvanize market participants globally on establishing a digital asset ecosystem  with the issuance of a whitepaper titled “Advancing the Digital Asset Era  Together.”In addition to the six core principles  the latest paper also presents a list of controls to help firms mitigate risks such as asset mismanagement or insufficient controls to govern smart contracts. Recommended controls include defining who can access smart contracts  and maintaining a comprehensive record of digital asset events/transactions.The FMIs collaborated with BCG  which conducted an analysis including reviews of approximately 100 regulations and whitepapers across multiple jurisdictions  and over 20 interviews with key market participants and technology vendors.,neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,mixed,0.57,0.18,0.24,True,English,"['digital asset blueprint', 'DTCC', 'Clearstream', 'Euroclear', 'largest financial market infrastructures', 'wide digital asset ecosystem', 'wide cross section', 'broad ecosystem development', 'Boston Consulting Group', 'true collaborative effort', 'digital asset securities', 'digital asset marketplace', 'Digital Asset Era', 'global financial ecosystem', '$16 trillion business opportunity', 'strong track record', 'new business opportunities', 'New Digital Markets', 'key market participants', 'global illiquid assets', 'six core principles', 'global capital markets', 'risk management controls', 'future digital markets', 'DTCC Digital Assets', 'financial markets', 'global market', 'asset mismanagement', 'financial system', 'six principles', 'New technologies', 'capital efficiencies', 'reduced risk', 'unique opportunity', 'exciting opportunities', 'comprehensive record', 'tokenized assets', 'Customer Assets', 'market evolution', 'institutional adoption', 'inflection point', 'small-scale initiatives', 'successful adoption', 'comprehensive set', 'Legal Certainty', 'Regulatory Compliance', 'regulatory frameworks', 'sensitive data', 'smart contracts', 'flexible settlements', 'diverse networks', 'Operational Scalability', 'enormous promise', 'cost savings', 'tangible results', 'value generation', 'Nadine Chakar', 'Managing Director', 'next level', 'Jens Hachmeister', 'Issuer Services', 'current challenges', 'seamless integration', 'Philippe Laurensy', 'innovative solutions', 'evolving needs', 'balance sheets', 'positive impacts', 'vast network', 'client relationships', 'multiple jurisdictions', 'technology vendors', 'Global Head', 'insufficient controls', 'Recommended controls', 'comprehensive standards', 'unified standards', 'immense potential', 'latest paper', 'robust infrastructure', 'The FMIs', 'many firms', 'industry-wide collaboration', 'industry advancements', 'Source', 'world', 'Clearstream', 'Euroclear', 'BCG', 'blueprint', 'acceptance', 'tokenization', 'progress', 'silos', 'focus', 'cryptocurrencies', 'roadmap', 'operations', 'law', 'alignment', 'Resilience', 'Security', 'disruptions', 'Safeguarding', 'governance', 'Connectivity', 'Interoperability', 'transactions', 'efficiency', 'cost-effectiveness', 'standardization', 'blockchain', 'conversation', 'springboard', 'consensus', 'efforts', 'speed', 'safety', 'foundation', 'benefit', 'clients', 'plan', 'Product', 'Strategy', 'Innovation', 'objective', 'customers', 'flexibility', 'space', 'tokenisation', 'testament', 'commitment', 'partnership', 'decades', 'experience', 'issuance', 'whitepaper', 'addition', 'list', 'risks', 'analysis', 'reviews', '100 regulations', '20 interviews']",2024-05-29,2024-05-30,finextra.com

Resolution 14- Dividend RectificationThis Special Resolution relates to certain technical issues in respect of the Company's payment of the final dividend of 25 cents for the year ended 31 December 2022 which was declared on 26 April 2023 and paid on 7 July 2023 and the payment of an interim dividend of 15 cents for the year ended 31 December 2023 which was declared on 24 August 2023 and paid on 6 October 2023 (together  the ""Relevant Dividends"").The Companies Act 2006 (the ""Act"") provides that a public company may pay a dividend out of its distributable profits as shown in the last accounts circulated to members or  if interim accounts are used for these purposes  interim accounts that have been filed at Companies House. These requirements apply even if the company in question has sufficient distributable profits to pay the relevant dividends at the relevant time.The Company has always filed its statutory annual accounts in accordance with the requirements of the Act  and there were sufficient distributable profits in the Group to justify the Relevant Dividends  once the required amounts were distributed to the Company and had Interim Accounts been prepared. Following the distribution to the Company of $20 000 000 on 31 March 2023  the Company would therefore have been in a position to deliver interim accounts showing the requisite level of distributable profits for the Relevant Dividends to Companies House to satisfy the procedural requirements of the Act. However  regrettably  due to an administrative oversight  it did not do so. This involuntary omission gave rise to a breach of the technical requirements of the Act.Consequently  the Company may have claims against past and present shareholders who were recipients of the Relevant Dividends (the ""Recipient Shareholders"") and against persons who were directors of the Company at the time of the declaration and payment of the Relevant Dividends (the ""Relevant Directors"") up to the aggregate amount by which the value of the Relevant Dividends exceeded the value of the Company's distributable profits as justified by reference to its filed accounts for the financial year ended 31 December 2022 (being the financial year immediately preceding the year in which the Relevant Dividends were declared and paid). For reference  this amount was approximately $10.4 million of the Relevant Dividends (out of a total dividend of $15.9 million.To address this technical issue  it is proposed that the Company enters into a deed of release in respect of the Recipient Shareholders (the ""Shareholders' Deed of Release"")  the form of which is contained in Schedule 1 to this notice  waiving any claims for repayment of the relevant amount of the Relevant Dividends which the Company may otherwise in theory be entitled to bring against them. In addition  it is proposed that the Company appropriate distributable reserves of the Company to the payment of each of the Relevant Dividends.The Relevant Directors have not sought a Deed of Release from the Company. The Company has been advised that it is preferable for Shareholders to approve the Company's entry into of the shareholders' Deed of Release since the release of those past and present Shareholders who appeared on the register of members on the record date for the Relevant Dividends (or their personal representatives (and their successors in title) if they are deceased) from any and all claims which the Company has or may have in respect of the payment of the Relevant Dividends will  insofar as those persons remain Shareholders of the Company  comprise a shareholder distribution. This will not however have any impact on the financial position of the Company because the aggregate amount of the Relevant Dividends is offset by the release of each relevant Shareholder from the liability to repay the amount already paid and the Company will not be required to make any further payments to shareholders in respect of the Relevant Dividends. If passed  this Resolution will ratify the Relevant Dividends and give the Board authority to enter into the Deed of Release and put all potentially affected Recipient Shareholders  so far as possible  in the position in which they were always intended to be had the Relevant Dividends been made in accordance with the procedural requirements of the Act. 16. Resolution 14 - Share Buyback Rectification The Relevant Share Buybacks and the Buyback Deed The requirements in respect of sufficient distributable reserves as well as filing of interim accounts at the relevant time also applies when a public company buys back shares. In order to effect the lawful transfer of shares acquired by Panmure Gordon (UK) Limited (""Panmure Gordon"") pursuant to the Relevant Share Buyback  it is proposed that the Company enters into a buyback deed with Panmure Gordon (the ""Buyback Deed"") thereby transferring equitable title in 103 211 Shares (the ""Buyback Shares"") from Panmure Gordon to the Company. The entry by the Company into the Buyback Deed with Panmure Gordon requires Shareholder authorisation under section 694 of the Act. For the purposes of the Act  the Buyback Deed will constitute an ""off-market"" purchase contract where the Buyback Shares will be purchased otherwise on a 5Notice of Annual General Meeting recognised investment exchange. Specific authority to make this off-market purchase is also being sought in the Resolution. The Board intends to hold the Buyback Shares purchased under this authority as treasury shares. The terms of the Buyback Deed provide that on entry into the deed  Panmure Gordon will be reinstated on the Company's register of members  evidencing its legal title over the Buyback Shares. Immediately following this reinstatement  the Company will purchase the Buyback Shares for a consideration of £1 payable to Panmure Gordon and Panmure Gordon will not be required to account for the monies originally paid to it by the Company in respect of any of the Share Buyback. Pursuant to the Buyback Deed  the Company will also waive any rights or claims which it has or may have against Panmure Gordon in respect of the Share Buyback and the moneys paid by the Company to Panmure Gordon in respect of the Buyback Shares. ln addition  Panmure Gordon will acknowledge that its reinstatement on the Company's register of members in respect of the Buyback Shares will satisfy the Company's obligation to restore legal title in the Buyback Shares to it. The Company will also indemnify Panmure Gordon  each of its respective affiliated companies and their respective directors  officers  employees and agents (""lndemnified Parties"") from and against any and all claims  losses  damages  liabilities or reasonable expenses which the lndemnified Party may suffer or incur  or which may be made or threatened against an lndemnified Party in relation to the matters the subject of the Buyback Deed. Panmure Gordon will also waive any rights or claims it has or may have to dividends otherwise due in respect of the Buyback Shares  any rights or claims it has or may have to the current value of the Buyback Shares and any other rights  claims  interests or benefits which may have arisen in respect of the Buyback Shares prior to the date of the Buyback Deed. The entry by the Company into the Buyback Deed will result in the Company's distributable reserves being reduced by £1. Otherwise it will have no effect on the Company's financial position. 17 The following documents are available for inspection by members at the registered office of the Company during normal business hours (except Bank Holidays) and at the place of the meeting not less than 15 minutes prior to and during the meeting.

Among the region’s growing tech forces is Oslo  which analysts have ranked 17th in the top 100 emerging ecosystems in the world.Norway’s capital city houses over 2 000 startups and scaleups  with particular strengths in ICT  healthtech and life sciences  energy  and fintech.Oslo is also home to seven unicorns  including popular game-based learning platform Kahoot!  paper tablet developer reMarkable  and industrial SaaS startup Cognite.While the city’s startups saw VC funding decrease to €862mn in 2023 (from €1.3bn in 2022)  Oslo remained among the top 15 European cities for venture capital investment in the first quarter of 2024. It raised a total of $236mn — a 35% increase compared to the same period last year.The <3 of EU tech The latest rumblings from the EU tech scene  a story from our wise ol' founder Boris  and some questionable AI art. It's free  every week  in your inbox. Sign up now!To get a closer look at Oslo’s startups  TNW took a trip to the Scandinavian city. We’re zooming in on four companies you should know about:StriseStrise joined the fight against financial crime in 2019 by launching its anti-money laundering (AML) automation software. Since then  it has become a key player in the Nordics  with 70% of the region’s top-tier banks  including Nordea and Danske Bank  using its services.The startup was founded by Marit Rødevand  Sigve Søråsen  and Patrick Skjennum.The trio had their Eureka moment during a research project on data models at Norway’s NTNU university. Although they had no previous experience in banking  they recognised that their AI software could track funds flowing through the sector.From left to right: Sigve Søråsen  co-founder and CPO  Marit Rødevand  co-founder and CEO  and Patrick Skjennum  co-founder and CTO. Credit: Strise“Twelve years ago  the HSBC $881mn money laundering scandal with the Mexican cartels put AML under everyone’s radar and increased regulations ” Rødevand tells TNW. “But banks’ risk assessment processes are still heavily manual  which means they’re time-consuming and prone to errors.”To address this  Strise has developed an end-to-end AML automation cloud. The startup combines advanced graph models  GenAI  and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to collect  analyse  and validate real-time customer data. This includes both onboarding and ongoing monitoring checks  such as due diligence (DD)  KYC (know your customer)  and KYB (know your business) checks.Strise also provides customisable solutions and a number of different APIs. “Our approach is covering both the need for data and for automated  more efficient workflows ” Rødevand says.According to the startup  its clients claim 90% faster due diligence and software cost reductions of up to 30%.Strise has raised €15.5mn in funding and is now expanding to the UK. In time  it plans to enter more European markets and the US. “Our long-term vision is to help eradicate financial crime ” Rødevand says. “In the future  we aim to build AI solutions for more related verticals.”DatabuttonRiding the no-code movement but with a twist  Databutton has developed a GenAI web app developer.Founded in 2021 by Cognite alumni Trygve Karper  Martin Røed  and Viral Shah  Databutton enables anyone to quickly build an application by chatting with an AI interface — without requiring programming skills.Using the ChatGPT-4 API  the startup provides three AI agents: one helps build the backend of the app  another provides the user interface (UI)  and a third simulates discussions about the overall idea.According to Shah  who’s also serving as the company’s CPO  the collaborative process is entirely conversational.“As a user  you have a lot to contribute. You understand your domain  you understand the business that you work in  you understand the data that you’re using in the app ” he tells TNW. “These are things that the model doesn’t understand.”From left to right: Martin Røed  co-founder and CTO  Viral Shah  co-founder and CPO  and Trygve Karper  co-founder and CEO. Credit: Alex Asensi/DatabuttonCompared to typical no-code tools  Databutton claims increased flexibility.“No-code platforms have a limited set of building blocks for the backend. The same goes for UI integrations ” Shah says. He explains that the startup’s GenAI features generate code through conversation  which enables users to use any API or integrate any database. “That’s because what you generate is Python code.”This also means that it’s possible to use existing libraries in Python or in React for UI components.Databutton mainly targets professionals in roles adjacent to developers  such as product managers  UX designers  and technical customer success specialists. This is also the market where it’s seeing the biggest demand for its product.The startup counts over 5 000 users across the globe  while its platform’s use cases span from healthcare and education to fintech and e-commerce. It has raised €4.6mn in funding to date.ZerolyticsAmidst a global push (and need) for carbon neutrality  Zerolytics is developing a data-driven platform that assesses the credibility of companies’ net-zero targets.With this tool  the startup aims to help asset managers identify net-zero investments that can also deliver competitive financial returns.For asset managers  navigating the intersection of climate action and profit can be “a tricky balance ” says Zerolytics CPO and co-founder Atle Christiansen. “We believe that it doesn’t have to be.”The startup’s platform measures the green transition readiness and progress of companies by calculating the gap between projected tracks for net zero and stated reduction targets. It also quantifies the financial implications of achieving carbon neutrality through different courses of action.According to Christiansen  these insights are key for the decision-making process of asset managers. “Existing tools are too simplistic  essentially analysing historical emissions and performing trend forecasts ” he tells TNW.“We need more advanced tools that connect historical emissions with what companies are actually doing  taking into account that the net-zero transition isn’t linear but depends on the interplay of multiple factors.”From left to right: Per-Otto Wold  co-founder and CEO  and Atle Christiansen  co-founder and CPO. Credit: ZerolyticsTo analyse and forecast the interaction of intertwined factors  Zerolytics uses system dynamics modelling. The startup has also developed financial digital twins to enable users to simulate different net-zero pathways and evaluate the financial impact of changes in key parameters.The startup’s tools currently target Climate Action 100+ focus companies  which represent the world’s biggest greenhouse gas emitters. The list includes the likes of Shell and BP. In time  Zerolytics will expand its model according to its clients’ needs.Zerolytics was founded in 2022 by Christiansen  Per-Otto Wold  Bent Erik Bakken  Vegard Egeland  and Morten Hofgaard Jørstad.The startup has already soft-launched its platform to a number of selected asset managers for feedback. It plans to fully launch later this year. In its latest funding round in 2023  Zerolytics raised €3.5mn.OtovoFounded in 2016 by Andreas Thorsheim and Simen Fure Jørgensen  Otovo’s mission is to support Europe’s transition to residential solar power.The startup provides an online marketplace that connects a network of local  vetted installers with consumers who wish to install solar panels on their roofs. “Think of it as an Airbnb or Uber for solar ” Thorsheim tells TNW.The concept was born when the founding duo realised that the continuously decreasing price of solar panels meant that the switch to solar was more of a “last-mile delivery problem ” Thorsheim says.Among the growing number of startups seeking to make solar panel installation as easy as any online purchase  Otovo stands out with its proprietary technology.The startup uses machine learning to analyse satellite and mapping information for any given house. It calculates the house’s shape and determines the amount of panels that fit on the roof. “We call it ‘the Tetris operation’ ” Thorsheim says.The software then presents different solar panel options (in number  size  and type) and matches house owners with the most competitive offers from local installers. Otovo manages the entire process from selection and installation to maintenance. Consumers can pay upfront for the service or opt for a monthly subscription.Andreas Thorsheim  Otovo’s founder and CEO. Credit: OtovoAccording to Thorsheim  it took Otovo two years to convince installers in Norway to sign up on the platform. Now  the startup counts 980 installer companies across 13 markets  including the UK  the Netherlands  Spain  and Italy. It has completed over 25 000 installation projects.In 2021  Otovo added battery systems to its offerings to enable storage of surplus solar energy for later use.The same year  the startup went public after listing on the Euronext Growth stock exchange. To date  it has raised €150mn in equity and €100mn in debt.When it comes to climate tech  Norway works as a “future lab” for what Europe is going to look like in the next three to five years  Thorsheim says.“That’s great for the startup ecosystem here. We get to test what the future can be in a smaller environment.”,neutral,0.05,0.49,0.45,negative,0.02,0.35,0.63,True,English,"['financial crime fighters', 'net-zero defenders', '4 Oslo startups', 'HSBC $881mn money laundering scandal', 'paper tablet developer reMarkable', 'banks’ risk assessment processes', 'Sigve Søråsen', 'technical customer success specialists', 'popular game-based learning platform', 'Cognite alumni Trygve Karper', 'GenAI web app developer', 'top 100 emerging ecosystems', 'Natural Language Processing', 'Martin Røed', 'growing tech forces', 'software cost reductions', 'top 15 European cities', 'venture capital investment', 'advanced graph models', 'ongoing monitoring checks', 'AML automation cloud', 'Marit Rødevand', 'questionable AI art', 'three AI agents', 'AML) automation software', '90% faster due diligence', 'VC funding decrease', 'EU tech scene', 'real-time customer data', 'industrial SaaS startup', ""wise ol' founder"", 'anti-money laundering', 'top-tier banks', 'AI software', 'European markets', 'GenAI features', 'data models', 'AI solutions', 'capital city', 'evolving hubs', 'particular strengths', 'life sciences', 'seven unicorns', 'first quarter', 'same period', 'latest rumblings', 'closer look', 'four companies', 'financial crime', 'key player', 'Danske Bank', 'Patrick Skjennum', 'Eureka moment', 'research project', 'NTNU university', 'previous experience', 'Mexican cartels', 'business) checks', 'customisable solutions', 'different APIs', 'efficient workflows', 'long-term vision', 'related verticals', 'programming skills', 'overall idea', 'collaborative process', 'limited set', 'building blocks', 'existing libraries', 'UX designers', 'biggest demand', 'use cases', 'startup scene', 'code movement', 'code tools', 'code platforms', 'Scandinavian city', 'UI integrations', 'UI components', 'Viral Shah', 'ChatGPT-4 API', 'product managers', 'Python code', 'Databutton claims', 'user interface', 'Nordics', 'region', 'Oslo', 'analysts', 'world', 'Norway', '2,000 startups', 'scaleups', 'ICT', 'healthtech', 'energy', 'fintech', 'total', '35% increase', 'story', 'Boris', 'inbox', 'TNW', 'trip', 'Strise', 'fight', 'Nordea', 'services', 'trio', 'banking', 'funds', 'sector', 'left', 'CPO', 'CEO', 'Credit', 'everyone', 'radar', 'regulations', 'errors', 'end', 'NLP', 'onboarding', 'DD', 'KYC', 'KYB', 'number', 'approach', 'need', 'clients', 'UK', 'future', 'twist', 'application', 'discussions', 'company', 'lot', 'domain', 'things', 'typical', 'flexibility', 'conversation', 'users', 'database', 'React', 'professionals', 'roles', 'developers', 'globe', 'healthcare', 'education', 'date', 'Zerolytics']",2024-05-29,2024-05-30,thenextweb.com

EF CLIF has conducted several large prospective observational studies in large numbers of patients admitted to hospital in Europe and Latin America for acute decompensation of cirrhosis  helping to better understand the onset and progression of ACLF.Professor Richard Moreau  MD  PhD  Director of EF CLIF Governing Board declared: “I am delighted to welcome experts to this event jointly organized by GENFIT and EF CLIF  marking the commencement of our partnership. This occasion will showcase the collaborative research efforts of EF CLIF  recognized as a leading authority in ACLF  and GENFIT  a biotechnology company dedicated to improving care of patients with ACLF. Together  we aim to advance the understanding of ACLF pathophysiology and uncover novel approaches for the treatment of this syndrome.”Both EF CLIF and GENFIT are committed to working towards achieving a patient-centered healthcare system and are pleased to be associated with the Global Liver Institute (GLI) and the European Liver Patients' Association (ELPA) for the launch of this initiative.Speakers include:Richard Moreau  Director of EF CLIFPascal Prigent  CEO of GENFIT and Dean Hum  Chief Scientific Officer of GENFITDonna R.

Members include national patient associations and caregivers.ELPA’s aim is to promote the interests of people with liver disease and  in particular  to promote awareness and prevention; address the lack of awareness of liver disease as compared to other areas of medicine such as heart disease; share experience of successful initiatives; and work with professional bodies such as EASL and with the EU to ensure that treatment and care are harmonized across Europe to the highest standards.ABOUT EASLThe European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) Annual Congress is a major international conference and brings together over 7 000 professionals  including clinicians  researchers  allied health professionals  patient representatives  and industry professionals. It stands out as Europe’s largest event in this domain.

In patients with liver cirrhosis and acute hepatic decompensation  ACLF can be triggered by a precipitating event (e.g. an infection) that leads to a progressive functional deterioration of multiple organs with high short-term mortality (23% to 74% mortality at 28 days1). In 2021  the prevalence of ACLF was estimated to be approximately 294 000 across the US  EU4  and UK2; a number expected to grow up to ~ 300 000 patients by 20363. The incidence is growing at epidemic rates (+26% between 2006 and 2014) due to an aging population and a higher prevalence of steatotic liver disease4  diabetes  obesity  as well as alcohol consumption.ABOUT GENFITGENFIT is a late-stage biopharmaceutical company committed to improving the lives of patients with rare  life-threatening liver diseases whose medical needs remain largely unmet.

The S&P500 clawed back 0.02% to 5 306... but it's 'green'  for the symbol  despite a clear majority of stocks down.But the US indices would all have ended in the red without Nvidia: once again  the latter represents 100% with its +7% rise  which adds another $190 billion in 'capi' to the US market  the equivalent of TotalEnergies. Nvidia ($2 848 bn) is now hot on the heels of Apple ($2 935 bn)  and at the close weighs a little more than the CAC40 (E2 844 bn)  and as much as the DAX40 and BEL20 combined.The oil sector is the day's second-best performer behind semiconductors  with ASML +3.7%  AMD +3.2%  Micron +2.5%  Marvell +2.2% (the SOXX has gained +1.9% and is posting around +25% this year).With a gain more than twice that of the S&P  the hegemony of the ""technos"" is absolute  with no sector to compete with it since the start of the year: in five months  it represents a capitalization addition greater than all French listed stocks (more than the SBF 120 and all Euronext compartments  in other words).Wall Street's performance has become so stratospheric that many Americans are euphoric: the Conference Board's consumer confidence barometer improved to 102 in May from 97.5 in April  whereas the consensus was for a decline. In such a climate  the surge in bond yields goes completely unnoticed.More important dates will mark the end of the week  starting with Friday's release of PCE inflation figures  which will provide further information on future interest rate trends  particularly from the Fed  in a climate of growing skepticism about the possibility of further rate cuts.Copyright (c) 2024 CercleFinance.com.

The 175-megawatt (MW) project will generate enough energy to power the equivalent of 30 000 Arkansas homes each year.Crooked Lake Solar Park will directly support Arkansas’ electric grid and is built on land leased by local landowners who recognize the benefits of hosting a solar project and believe the economic impact it’ll bring to the city and greater county  complimenting the area’s agricultural heritage.Crooked Lake will support more than 330 construction jobs and six permanent jobs dedicated to the ongoing operations and routine maintenance of the project. It will disburse an estimated $106.2 million to local landowners  pay an estimated $12.4 million in taxes to local governments throughout the project’s life  and invest millions of dollars in the local economy over the next several decades. It will also save more than 222 million gallons of water each year that would have otherwise been consumed by conventional generation sources for equivalent energy capacity.“We’re proud to continue our expansion in the South with a focus on serving the clean energy needs of Arkansas ” stated Sandhya Ganapathy  CEO of EDP Renewables North America. “By providing sustainable energy to Mississippi County and the surrounding area  we are generating economic growth and grid stability for generations to come in the region.”A special focus was placed on STEM education and local community impact  utilizing the construction of the project to educate K-12 students at Armorel School District and Blytheville School District on the benefits of wind and solar through school visits and science-related challenges organized in partnership with KidWind. In addition  the project team - alongside groups like 4H and Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority  Incorporated® - volunteered and donated to several organizations revitalizing Blytheville and broader Mississippi County  including the Adopt a Block Initiative and Mississippi County Union Mission.“We’re grateful for EDPR NA working alongside The City of Blytheville’s Quality of Life Division to take an active role in helping to beautify our city and to unite our community together to do something positive. EDPR NA’s sponsorship in the Adopt a Block Initiative provided much-needed logistical support and supplies ” stated Mayor Melisa Logan. “The team through their support helped us highlight heroes that took the courageous step to adopt blocks in our community  which truly made an impact.”The move into Arkansas marks EDPR NA’s continued growth into new state markets in the South  most recently expanding its utility-scale operations in North Carolina and Mississippi  as well as its distributed generation footprint in states spanning Virginia and South Carolina down to Florida and Louisiana.Multimedia resources include:About EDPR NA Fact SheetEDPR NA Crooked Lake Fact SheetSolar Power in North America Video###About EDP Renewables North AmericaEDP Renewables North America LLC (EDPR NA)  its affiliates  and its subsidiaries develop  construct  own  and operate wind farms  solar parks  and energy storage systems throughout North America.

Digital Enabler Solution Know-How (DESK) Company listed on the Euronext Growth Milan market (Ticker: RLT) is proud to announce the official launch of its new RexAI technology at the 2024 edition of SPS Italia. It is an innovative cutting-edge technology that represents a turning point in the field of artificial intelligence applied to industrial processes and revolves around the concepts of explainability and trust. The aim is to make man an active protagonist and not only able to operate a machine  but to establish a real collaboration with it. RexAI is a complete solution that  with the frontier technology of artificial intelligence  combines a robust set of skills that Relatech makes available to guide companies in the collaborative use of AI to support processes and give life to that digital humanism that characterizes industry 5.0. What is RexAI? RexAI is the new digital assistant that Relatech offers to companies to make artificial intelligence a comprehensible and transparent technology. Its name RexAI comes from the combination of the prefix ""Re""  representative of Relatech  and ""xAI""  which stands for Explainable AI. The choice to give this designation reflects Relatech's commitment to making artificial intelligence an accessible and understandable technology for the end user  regardless of their level of technological readiness. This is also in line with what is stated in the AI Act  the law on artificial intelligence recently approved at European level  whose aim is to ensure that AI systems reflect the fundamental rights and values of the EU - including human centrality  security and transparency - while promoting innovation in a non-technological key  but also social and environmental well-being. Why do we need explainable AI? Today  everyone is talking about Artificial Intelligence  however in most cases it is still perceived as a ""black box"" that does not offer any transparency on the factors that lead to a certain decision. The success rate in adopting a technology is no longer only strictly dependent#BuildYourDigitalFuture on its ease of use but also on the trust it inspires  and RexAI makes AI a technology that is understandable to humans  offering users the ability to talk to the machine and understand the motivations behind every decision made by artificial intelligence. This approach is particularly crucial in the manufacturing industry  where timely  accurate and motivated decision-making is the foundation of operational excellence. Key Features of RexAI RexAI is the link between the digital and physical worlds. In Relatech's vision  RexAI represents the guide within the enterprise of the future  as it enables the interaction between the physical and virtual worlds in a fluid way  between machines or production processes and their digital representations seamlessly. A digital assistant that not only allows you to communicate with machines in natural language  but also allows access to corporate and general context information  making every operation more efficient and immediate. Practical applications During the SPS Exhibition  Relatech shows how RexAI can be used in various production contexts. Inside the booth  a demonstration allows you to see RexAI interact with a cherry dispensing machine  showing how natural voice command can translate into precise and optimized actions. In addition  RexAI offers easy access to analytics  providing targeted answers to the questions asked by the user based on all the data generated by the machine. Integration with the Relatech offer RexAI will be integrated into all Relatech products  starting with the ReFab Studio platform. It is a solution that allows the digitization and modeling of plants and production processes that reduces the distance between the physical and digital worlds  offering through RexAI the opportunity to access universal knowledge that goes far beyond the simple digital model. ReFab Studio  combined with RexAI  allows you to monitor  predict  and interact with your business assets efficiently and accurately. Into the future Precisely because of its ductility  RexAI technology can represent a point of arrival for companies already digitized  but also a starting point for those who intend to embark on a digitization path.",neutral,0.04,0.96,0.01,positive,0.51,0.47,0.02,True,English,"['innovative Artificial Intelligence technology', 'digital world', 'smart industry', 'SPS Fair', 'Relatech', 'access', 'RexAI', 'Parma', 'Relatech S.p.A.', 'Digital Enabler Solution Know-How', 'innovative Artificial Intelligence technology', 'general context information', 'innovative cutting-edge technology', 'natural voice command', 'various production contexts', 'simple digital model', 'ReFab Studio platform', 'new digital assistant', 'cherry dispensing machine', 'new RexAI technology', 'natural language', 'digital world', 'complete solution', 'digital humanism', 'digital representations', 'frontier technology', 'transparent technology', 'understandable technology', 'production processes', 'SPS Fair', 'Parma Parma', 'Euronext Growth', 'Milan market', 'official launch', 'SPS Italia', 'active protagonist', 'real collaboration', 'robust set', 'technological readiness', 'fundamental rights', 'human centrality', 'technological key', 'environmental well-being', 'most cases', 'black box', 'success rate', 'timely, accurate', 'motivated decision-making', 'operational excellence', 'Key Features', 'virtual worlds', 'fluid way', 'Practical applications', 'SPS Exhibition', 'optimized actions', 'targeted answers', 'universal knowledge', 'business assets', 'industrial processes', 'smart industry', 'turning point', 'Explainable AI', 'AI Act', 'AI systems', 'manufacturing industry', 'starting point', 'collaborative use', 'end user', 'European level', 'Relatech offer', 'Relatech products', 'digitization path', 'physical worlds', 'easy access', 'RexAI RexAI', '29th', 'Ticker', 'RLT', '2024 edition', 'field', 'concepts', 'explainability', 'trust', 'aim', 'skills', 'companies', 'life', 'comprehensible', 'name', 'combination', 'prefix', 'representative', 'choice', 'designation', 'commitment', 'accessible', 'line', 'law', 'values', 'security', 'transparency', 'innovation', 'social', 'everyone', 'factors', 'ease', 'humans', 'users', 'motivations', 'approach', 'foundation', 'link', 'vision', 'guide', 'enterprise', 'future', 'interaction', 'machines', 'corporate', 'booth', 'demonstration', 'precise', 'addition', 'analytics', 'questions', 'data', 'Integration', 'modeling', 'plants', 'distance', 'opportunity', 'ductility', 'arrival']",2024-05-29,2024-05-30,marketscreener.com

BG FundBG Fund (EUR B) contributed positively for the quarter.1.1. Volatility strategiesMandatory Convertible Bond ArbitrageMandatory convertible bonds contributed slightly positively.Convertible Bond ArbitrageConvertible bond strategies detracted over this period  mainly impacted by specific idiosyncratic risk positions which experienced refinancing stress. The Investment Manager remains confident that positive solutions will emerge for these positions soon. Apart from these specific detractors  the fund experienced positive contributions from positioning on volatility trades while carefully selected credit positions also had a positive performance. The key frustration was that European primary issuance continued to remain at low levels. The Investment Manager hopes this is just a temporary delay in the expected pipeline.On the positive side  US convertible bonds had an overall decent performance with a slow but steady rise in valuations across the board. New issue activity was healthy  and the anticipated pipeline has started to arrive in earnest. The fund was selective and positioning cautiously as the large amount of primary could lead to some cheapening in secondary markets.Volatility TradingThe period remained challenging for volatility strategies as both realised and implied volatility remained subdued in the continued bull market environment. In this environment  there were few new trading opportunities. Nevertheless  volatility trading succeeded in contributing positively thanks to dispersion trades. During the period  the Investment Manager made modest portfolio adjustments  incrementally increasing positions and engaging in marginal trades while remaining vigilant and staying alert to market shifts  ready to take advantage of opportunities as they arose.Warrant TradingWarrant arbitrage contributed slightly positively.1.2. Equity StrategiesEquity strategies ended the period almost flat. On the positive side  the gains were spread across a wide range of investments but aggregate performance was held back by an overall relatively low level of corporate activity in Europe. In the special situations book a number of expected and rumoured deals have so far failed to materialise  or are taking longer than expected to play out  leading to underperformance. This notwithstanding  the interest rate and financing environment has become more stable which should encourage the emergence of further activity. Several new deals were announced during the quarter in Europe and  despite these being relatively small  the investment manager is expecting an increase in both the size and volume of deals to come through.1.3. Credit StrategiesCredit Long / ShortCredit long / short contributed positively this period  driven primarily by private credit positions.Credit Special SituationsCredit special situations was the main detractor to the fund this period  impacted primarily by a specific idiosyncratic position on a French technology services company. Its bonds were extremely volatile on thin volumes and sold off in reaction to news on discussions surrounding a likely restructuring of the company's balance sheet.1.4. TradingTrading was the main positive contributor to the performance of the fund this period  in particular from thematic discretionary trading and the systematic trend following strategies.2.

The data used involved nearly 1 700 000 people in France and the United States. To protect this work  a patent application was filed and this patent has just been issued by the European Patent Office under number EP3164824.This Artificial Intelligence method  and more specifically supervised learning  falls within the field of AI and Machine Learning. Very strong growth of over 30% is expected on these subjects in the coming years1.The patent proposes an innovative method consisting in selecting the individuals closest in the multidimensional space of risk factors (age  personal history  parameters from imaging  genetic data ...) and then observing their outcome over a given period. For example  by taking the 1 000 closest neighboring profiles and observing 30 cancers 10 years later  the risk will be estimated at 3%. This method applies to both quantitative and qualitative data such as words. The patent integrates data such as ethnicity or breast density into risk factors with a method for quantifying this type of factor. This process can therefore be easily combined with generative AI methods using language models by providing quantitative answers to text-based questions such as: ""what happens if I stop smoking or have too much tension?"". The applications are therefore very promising.This method was optimized on French data and then validated on 1 000 000 American women from the BCSC (Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium). The predictive performances have proven to be excellent  as they avoid any overestimation or underestimation in subgroups unlike more classic methods (of parametric statistics)  while maintaining great flexibility (compared to those of data mining).This method has been validated for breast cancer and the patent claims have been accepted for all diseases.In addition to its general applications  this patent strengthens the protection of the MammoRisk® software  in addition to copyright. This patent constitutes a valuable asset as this model has been selected by the European Union within the framework of the MyPeBS clinical trial which aims to modify the screening of the 100 million European women over 40 by measuring the risk of breast cancer of each woman.1. https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/artificial-intelligence-machine-learning-market-size-u7skf/This asset  limited to this application  was recently valued by Sorgem Évaluation at €207 million.“The granting of this patent gives us additional protection in predictive medicine. This proprietary AI method can be applied to all diseases and we will decline it on different databases. This work from French research centers has received international validation by its application on American data and its selection by the European Union"" comments Stéphane Ragusa  Chairman and CEO of Predilife.About PREDILIFEPREDILIFE is a pioneer in the design and development of prediction tests to prevent major diseases. It uses artificial intelligence methods applied to clinical and genetic medical data in a secure legal framework. The prediction of these individual risks makes it possible to propose a personalized follow-up protocol and earlier identification of pathologies.To learn more: https://www.predilife.com/en/ContactsPREDILIFE Investor RelationsStéphane RagusaChairman and CEOinvestisseurs@predilife.comPress Relations CAPVALUE01 80 81 50 00info@capvalue.frThis publication embed ""🔒 Actusnews SECURITY MASTER "".- SECURITY MASTER Key: xpmcY8hulG/GmZ9vaJlmmWWWaphoyGLHmGadxJRsl8yZaZppxm+XmMeVZnFnlWdr- Check this key: https://www.security-master-key.com .Regulated information:Inside Information:- other releases Full and original press release in PDF: https://www.actusnews.com/news/86025-cp-brevet_eg-gb.pdfReceive by email the next press releases of the company by registering on www.actusnews.com   it's free© 2024 ActusNews",neutral,0.05,0.92,0.04,positive,0.82,0.17,0.01,True,English,"['PREDILIFE STRENGTHENS', 'ASSETS', 'ISSUANCE', 'PATENT', 'AI', 'METHOD', 'Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium', 'breast cancer risk prediction method', '1,000 closest neighboring profiles', 'Stéphane Ragusa', 'artificial intelligence methods', 'personalized follow-up protocol', 'generative AI methods', 'MyPeBS clinical trial', '100 million European women', 'secure legal framework', 'original press release', 'next press releases', 'SECURITY MASTER Key', 'French research centers', 'Actusnews SECURITY MASTER', 'proprietary AI method', 'genetic medical data', 'European Patent Office', 'PREDILIFE Investor Relations', 'Press Relations', 'breast density', 'classic methods', 'prediction tests', 'personalized medicine', '1,000,000 American women', 'European Union', 'other releases', 'genetic data', 'French data', 'risk factors', 'innovative method', 'Euronext Growth', 'disease risks', 'MammoRisk® test', 'many years', 'Sorbonne University', 'Institut Telecom', 'United States', 'strong growth', 'coming years', 'multidimensional space', 'personal history', 'language models', 'text-based questions', 'predictive performances', 'parametric statistics', 'great flexibility', 'MammoRisk® software', 'Sorgem Évaluation', 'predictive medicine', 'different databases', 'international validation', 'individual risks', 'earlier identification', 'Regulated information', 'Inside Information', 'qualitative data', 'data mining', 'American data', 'patent claims', 'Machine Learning', 'quantitative answers', 'general applications', 'valuable asset', 'additional protection', 'PREDILIFE STRENGTHENS', 'major diseases', 'patent application', 'ASSETS', 'ISSUANCE', 'Villejuif', 'France', 'May', 'CET', 'specialist', 'result', 'collaboration', '1,700,000 people', 'number', 'field', 'Very', 'subjects', 'individuals', 'parameters', 'imaging', 'outcome', 'period', 'example', '30 cancers', 'words', 'ethnicity', 'type', 'process', 'tension', 'BCSC', 'overestimation', 'underestimation', 'subgroups', 'copyright', 'screening', 'woman', 'linkedin', 'pulse', 'artificial-intelligence-machine-learning-market', 'granting', 'selection', 'Chairman', 'CEO', 'pioneer', 'design', 'development', 'pathologies', 'Contacts', 'investisseurs', 'CAPVALUE', 'publication', 'xpmcY8hulG', 'GmZ9vaJlmmWWWaphoyGLHmGadxJRsl8yZaZppxm', 'XmMeVZnFnlWdr', 'Full', 'PDF', 'cp', 'brevet', 'email', 'company', '6:30', '2024']",2024-05-29,2024-05-30,marketscreener.com

Profitable and responsible growth modelIn the meeting of shareholders  CEO Benoît Coquart presented Legrand’s profitable and responsible growth model.The Group is ideally positioned in a buoyant industry that shows great promise in the mid-term  in particular thanks to i) its balanced exposure to various geographies and end-markets  ii) its central position in its value chain and iii) the depth of its offering.Legrand is pursuing its growth strategy  which is based on continuing to spend around 5% of its revenue on R&D  and on growing through bolt-on acquisitions3  of which five were announced in 2023.Initiatives to strengthen the Group’s positions in faster expanding segments (datacenters  connected solutions and energy efficiency products) were also detailed during the meeting. Together  these segments accounted for 36% of Legrand’s sales4 in 2023  with the target is to increase that ratio to 50% in the mid-term.The relevance of the Group’s strategic model is reflected in the creation of leading financial and non-financial value over the past five years: revenue rose sharply (by +40%)  adjusted operating margin averaged over 20%  net profit attributable to the Group per share grew by +50%  free cash flow was up +112% and CO 2 emissions were reduced by -53%.The success of the first international employee share purchase plan confirmed that Legrand’s teams are fully confident in the Group’s development model.

The efficacy and safety demonstrated in clinical trials and ongoing real-world experience  with over 300 patient-years of treatment  support that leniolisib fills an unmet medical need. We will continue to work closely with the EMA and CHMP to obtain approval for leniolisib in Europe for people living with APDS. In the meantime  all our clinical development and early access programs will continue.”The MAA for leniolisib was based on findings from a multinational  triple-blind  placebo-controlled  randomized Phase II/III clinical trial  which met both its co-primary endpoints. The trial evaluated efficacy and safety in 31 patients diagnosed with APDS aged 12 years and older. Also submitted as part of the application were data from a long-term  open-label extension clinical trial in which 37 patients received leniolisib for a median of three years.Leniolisib is currently available commercially in the United States. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved leniolisib in March 2023  based on its assessment that leniolisib met clinical and manufacturing standards.Story continuesPharming is maintaining its previously provided 2024 total revenue guidance.About Activated Phosphoinositide 3-Kinase δ Syndrome (APDS)APDS is a rare primary immunodeficiency that was first characterized in 2013. APDS is caused by variants in either one of two identified genes known as PIK3CD or PIK3R1  which are vital to the development and function of immune cells in the body. Variants of these genes lead to hyperactivity of the PI3Kδ (phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta) pathway  which causes immune cells to fail to mature and function properly  leading to immunodeficiency and dysregulation1 2 3 APDS is characterized by a variety of symptoms  including severe  recurrent sinopulmonary infections  lymphoproliferation  autoimmunity  and enteropathy.4 5 Because these symptoms can be associated with a variety of conditions  including other primary immunodeficiencies  it has been reported that people with APDS are frequently misdiagnosed and suffer a median 7-year diagnostic delay.6 As APDS is a progressive disease  this delay may lead to an accumulation of damage over time  including permanent lung damage and lymphoma.4-7 A definitive diagnosis can be made through genetic testing. APDS affects approximately 1 to 2 people per million worldwide.About leniolisibLeniolisib is an oral small molecule phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kẟ) inhibitor approved in the US and Israel as the first and only targeted treatment of activated phosphoinositide 3-kinase delta (PI3Kδ) syndrome (APDS) in adult and pediatric patients 12 years of age and older. Leniolisib inhibits the production of phosphatidylinositol-3-4-5-trisphosphate  which serves as an important cellular messenger and regulates a multitude of cell functions such as proliferation  differentiation  cytokine production  cell survival  angiogenesis  and metabolism. Results from a randomized  placebo-controlled Phase II/III clinical trial demonstrated clinical efficacy of leniolisib in the coprimary endpoints; demonstrating statistically significant impact on immune dysregulation and normalization of immunophenotype within these patients  and interim open label extension data has supported the safety and tolerability of long-term leniolisib administration.8 9 Leniolisib is currently under regulatory review in the European Economic Area  the U.K.  Canada and Australia  with plans to pursue further regulatory approvals in Japan and South Korea. Leniolisib is also being evaluated in two Phase III clinical trials in children with APDS.About Pharming Group N.V.Pharming Group N.V.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law.
