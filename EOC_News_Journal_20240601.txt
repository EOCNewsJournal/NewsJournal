Pursuant to the Company's Articles of Association  a member of the Company entitled to attend and vote at the meeting convened by this notice is entitled to appoint one or more proxies to exercise any of his rights to attend  speak and vote at that meeting on his behalf. If a member appoints more than one proxy  each proxy must be entitled to exercise the rights attached to different shares. If you submit more than one valid proxy appointment in respect of the same shares  the appointment received last before the latest time for the receipt of proxies will take precedence. A proxy may only be appointed using the procedures set out in these notes and the notes to the form of proxy. To validly appoint a proxy  a member must complete  sign and date the enclosed form of proxy and deposit it at the office of the Company's registrars  Neville Registrars  at Neville House  Steelpark Road  Halesowen  West Midlands B62 8HD  by 3.00 p.m on 24 June 2024 (or  in the event that the meeting is adjourned  not less than 48 hours  excluding non-working days  before the time fixed for the holding of the adjourned meeting). Any power of attorney or any other authority under which the form of proxy is signed (or a duly certified copy of such power or authority) must be enclosed with the form of proxy. In order to revoke a proxy appointment  a member must sign and date a notice clearly stating his intention to revoke his proxy appointment and deposit it at the office of the Company's registrars  Neville Registrars  at Neville House  Steelpark Road  Halesowen  West Midlands B62 8HD prior to commencement of the meeting. If the revocation is received after the time specified  the original proxy appointment will remain valid unless the member attends the meeting and votes in person. Pursuant to the Articles of Association  any corporation which is a member of the Company may authorise one or more persons (who need not be a member of the Company) to attend  speak and vote at the meeting as the representative of that corporation. A certified copy of the board resolution of the corporation appointing the relevant person as the representative of that corporation in connection with the meeting must be deposited at the office of the Company's registrars  Neville Registrars  at Neville House  Steelpark Road  Halesowen  West Midlands B62 8HD prior to the commencement of the meeting. If the revocation is received after the time specified  the original corporate representative appointment will remain valid unless the member attends the meeting and votes in person. In the case of joint holders  where more than one of the joint holders purports to appoint a proxy in respect of the same shares  only the appointment submitted by the most senior holder will be accepted. Seniority is determined by the order in which the names of the joint holders appear in the Company's register of members in respect of the joint holding (the first named being the most senior). The right to vote at the meeting shall be determined by reference to the register of members of the Company. Pursuant to Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001 (as amended)  only those persons whose names are entered on the register of members of the Company at 6.00 p.m. on 24 June 2024 (or  in the event of any adjournment  at 6.00 p.m. on the date which is two days prior to the adjourned meeting) shall be entitled to attend and vote in respect of the number of shares registered in their names at that time. Changes to entries on the register of members after that time shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to vote at the meeting. CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so for the meeting and any adjournment(s) thereof by using the procedures described in the CREST Manual (available via www.euroclear.com). CREST personal members or other CREST sponsored members  and those CREST members who have appointed a voting service provider(s)  should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s)  who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf.In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made by means of the CREST service to be valid  the appropriate CREST message (a ""CREST Proxy Instruction"") must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK & International Limited's (""Euroclear"") specifications and must contain the information required for such instructions  as described in the CREST Manual. The message  regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or is an amendment to the instruction given to a previously appointed proxy must  in order to be valid  be transmitted so as to be received by the Company's agent (ID 7RA11) by the latest time for proxy appointments set out in paragraph 3 above. For this purpose  the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to the message by the CREST Applications Host) from which the Company's agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. After this time any change of instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should be communicated to the appointee through other means. CREST members and  where applicable  their CREST sponsors or voting service providers should note that Euroclear does not make available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings and limitations will therefore  apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or  if the CREST member is a CREST personal member or sponsored member or has appointed a voting service provider(s)  to procure that his CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection  CREST members and  where applicable  their CREST sponsors or voting service providers are referred  in particular  to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings. The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001 (as amended). Any corporation which is a shareholder can appoint one or more corporate representatives who may exercise on its behalf all of its powers as a shareholder provided that no more than one corporate representative exercises powers in relation to the same shares. Any shareholder attending the Meeting has the right to ask questions. The Company must cause to be answered any such question relating to the business being dealt with at the Meeting but no such answer need be given if:(a) to do so would interfere unduly with the preparation for the Meeting or involve the disclosure of confidential information; (b) the answer has already been given on a website in the form of an answer to a question; or (c) it is undesirable in the interests of the Company or the good order of the Meeting that the question be answered. You may not use any electronic address (within the meaning of Section 333(4) of the Companies Act 2006) provided in either this Notice or any related documents (including the form of proxy) to communicate with the Company for any purposes other than those expressly stated.

Each share carries one vote.

Annual Financial Report (Resolution 1) Shareholders are being asked to receive the Annual Financial Report of the Company for the financial year ended 31 December 2023. The Annual Financial Report comprises the Annual Accounts of the Group including the Strategic Report  Directors' Report  Annual Report on Remuneration and the auditor's report on those Accounts and the auditable part of the Annual Report on Remuneration. Approval of Directors Report on Remuneration (Resolution 2) Resolution 2 seeks shareholders' authorisation to approve the Annual Report on Remuneration (excluding the part of the report  which sets out the Directors' Remuneration Policy) for the financial year ended 31 December 2023 as set out on pages 76 to 79 of the 2023 Annual Financial Report. It gives details of Directors' remuneration for the year ended 31 December 2023. Shareholders have an annual advisory vote on the report on Directors' remuneration. Approval of the Remuneration Policy (Resolution 3) Shareholders are being asked to approve the remuneration policy which has been circulated separately and is available on the Investor Section of the Company website. The remuneration policy takes effect immediately after the end of the AGM. Shareholders are being asked to give a binding vote on the new Directors' Remuneration Policy at the 2024 AGM. The Remuneration Committee intends to put the Directors' Remuneration Policy to shareholders for approval every three years  unless there is a need for the Directors' Remuneration Policy to be approved at an earlier stage. Re-election of Directors (Resolutions 4 to 9) Under clause 24.3 of the Company's Articles of Association  any Director appointed during the year must seek re-appointment at the next annual general meeting following their appointment to the Board. Under clause  24.4 of the Company's Articles of Association one-third of the Director's subject to retirement by rotation must retire at the annual general meeting. As this is the first AGM of the Company  all Directors were appointed during the year and all Director's will seek re-appointment at this AGM. Biographies of each of the Directors are set out in the Annual Financial Report 2023. All of the Directors have wide ranging business knowledge  bringing valuable skills and experience and the Board considers that each of the Directors continues to make an effective  valuable contribution and demonstrate commitment to the role. Accordingly  the Board recommends the re-election of each of these Directors. Auditor (Resolutions 10 and 11) Resolution 10 seeks shareholders' authorisation to re-appoint BDO LLP as the Company's auditor to hold office until the next Annual General Meeting of the Company. Resolution 11 seeks shareholders' authorisation for the Directors to determine the auditor's remuneration.Authority to Allot Shares (Resolution 12) The Directors may allot or grant rights over ordinary shares only if authorised to do so by a resolution of shareholders. Resolution 12 seeks a new authority under section 551 of the Companies Act 2006 to authorise the Directors to allot shares or grant rights to subscribe for  or convert any security into  shares in the Company. It will expire at the conclusion of next year's AGM or  if earlier  15 months from the passing of this Resolution. Resolution 12 follows institutional investor guidelines regarding the authority to allot shares. Paragraph (a) of resolution 12 would give the Directors authority to allot shares or grant rights to subscribe for  or convert any security into  shares (""Rights"") up to a maximum nominal amount of $39 989.33  representing approximately one third of the Company's existing issued share capital as at 30 May 2024  being the latest practicable before the publication of this Notice. This maximum is reduced by the nominal amount of shares allotted or Rights granted pursuant to paragraph (b) of resolution 12 in excess of $39 989.33. Paragraph (b) of resolution 12 gives the Directors authority to allot shares or grant Rights in connection with a rights issue only up to a maximum nominal amount of $79 978.67 representing approximately two-thirds of the Company's existing issued share capital. This maximum is reduced by the nominal amount of shares allotted or Rights granted pursuant to paragraph (a) of resolution 12. Therefore  the maximum nominal amount of shares allotted or Rights granted under resolution 12 is $79 978.67  representing approximately two-thirds of the Company's existing issued share capital. The Directors do not currently intend to use the authority set out in resolution 12. If they do use the authority set out in resolution 12  then they intend to follow best practice  as recommended by institutional investor guidelines. Disapplication of Pre-Emption Rights (Resolution 13 and 14) If the Directors wish to allot any shares or grant rights over shares or sell treasury shares for cash (other than under an employee share scheme) they are required by the Companies Act 2006 to offer them to existing shareholders pro rata. Resolutions 13 and 14  which are proposed as special resolutions  reflect the recommendations in PEG's (Pre- emption Group) revised Statement of Principles issued on 4 November 2022. The Statement of Principles implemented the recommendations of the UK Secondary Capital Raising Review that  subject to certain conditions  permitted non-pre-emptive issuances should increase from 10 per cent. to 20 per cent. of a company's issued share capital. Accordingly  as further described below  Resolution 13 provides for the disapplication of preemption rights on 10 per cent. of the Company's ordinary share capital on an unrestricted basis and Resolution 14 provides for the disapplication of pre-emption rights of a further 10 per cent. of the Company's ordinary share capital for the purposes of financing or refinancing an acquisition or capital investment. If passed  these resolutions will enable the Directors to allot equity securities for cash without having to comply with statutory pre-emption rights  but this power will be limited to allotments: under Resolution 13  in connection with a rights issue  open offer or other pre-emptive offer to ordinary Shareholders and holders of other equity securities as required by the rights of those securities or as the Directors otherwise consider necessary  but (in accordance with normal practice) subject to such exclusions or other arrangements as the Directors may deem necessary or expedient; up to an aggregate nominal amount of $11 996.80 (which represents approximately (but not more than) 10 per cent. of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company as at the Latest Practicable Date; and under Resolution 14  in addition to the authority referred to above  up to an aggregate nominal amount of $11 996.80 (which represents approximately (but not more than) 10 per cent. of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company as at the Latest Practicable Date) for use only for the purposes of financing or refinancing an acquisition or capital investment of the kind contemplated by the Statement of Principles on Disapplying PreEmption Rights published by PEG.",neutral,0.01,0.98,0.01,neutral,0.07,0.86,0.07,True,English,"['Amicorp FS UK', 'Notice', 'AGM', 'Kiran Kumar Gundu Rao', 'next Annual General Meeting', 'Annual Financial Report', 'Shakespeare Martineau LLP', 'respective existing holdings', 'aggregate nominal amount', 'other equity securities', 'UK) PLC Company', ""Directors' Remuneration Policy"", 'financial year', 'BDO LLP', 'other matter', 'existing powers', 'AMICORP FS', '6th Floor', '60 Gracechurch Street', ""Directors' Report"", 'Kathy) Byrne', 'Patrick Byron', 'Toine) Knipping', 'Kin Lai', 'Tat Cheung', 'Stephen) Wong', 'fractional entitlements', 'record dates', 'practical problems', 'relevant period', 'following resolutions', 'ordinary resolutions', 'special resolutions', 'existing authority', 'ordinary shares', 'treasury shares', 'Companies Act', 'legal, regulatory', 'rights issue', '14704124 Notice', 'GIVEN', 'AGM', 'offices', 'London', 'EC3V', '26 June', 'pages', 'Kathleen', 'That', 'Antonius', 'auditor', 'conclusion', 'substitution', 'purposes', 'section', 'security', 'limit', 'paragraph', 'excess', 'connection', 'offer', 'way', 'holders', 'proportion', 'restrictions', 'arrangements', 'laws', 'jurisdiction', 'passing', 'case', 'agreements', 'Board', 'cash', 'allotment', 'sale', 'time', '3.00', '15']",2024-05-31,2024-06-01,marketscreener.com

If approved  it will become the first chikungunya vaccine available in Europe to address this unmet medical need. In accordance with the International Recognition Procedure (IRP)1  Valneva is also preparing a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for submission to the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).The CHMP opinion follows the November 2023 approval of IXCHIQ® by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)2. Two additional marketing authorization applications are currently under review by Health Canada and the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency (ANVISA) with potential approvals in 2024.Juan Carlos Jaramillo  M.D.  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  commented  “This positive CHMP opinion marks a crucial milestone toward introducing a preventative solution against chikungunya in the EU. In recent years  climate change has caused the Aedes mosquito  a known carrier of chikungunya and dengue viruses  to spread to areas in Europe that were previously unaffected. It is critical to provide a vaccine solution not only to European travelers going to endemic chikungunya areas  such as South America or Africa  but also to the local European populations experiencing invasive mosquito attacks. The broader we can make this vaccine accessible  the better we will mitigate the burden of this debilitating illness  and we would like to thank our partner  CEPI  for supporting us in this endeavor.”Dr. Richard Hatchett  Chief Executive Officer of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI)  commented  “Over one billion people live in areas where Chikungunya is endemic  and recent large outbreaks underline the urgent need for safe and effective vaccines against this debilitating disease. Valneva’s single-dose vaccine is well-suited for use in outbreak response and in low-resource settings  and CEPI’s partnership with Valneva and Instituto Butantan – supported by the EU – will help to make this vaccine accessible to the people most affected by the virus in low- and middle-income countries. Today’s positive opinion from the EMA is an important step towards making the vaccine more widely available.”The positive CHMP opinion is supported by data from the pivotal Phase 3 study which were published in The Lancet  the world’s leading peer-reviewed medical journal  and showed a 98.9% seroresponse rate at 28 days with a single vaccination. This robust immune response was sustained for 24 months by 97% of participants and was equally durable in younger and older adults3. Earlier this month  Valneva reported further positive pivotal data in adolescents six months after a single vaccination  which are intended to support filing for potential label extension for use in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years4. The data are also expected to support licensure of IXCHIQ® in Brazil  which would be the first potential approval for use in an endemic population.About ChikungunyaChikungunya is a mosquito-borne viral disease caused by the chikungunya virus (CHIKV)  a Togaviridae virus  transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Infection leads to symptomatic disease in up to 97% of humans after four to seven days following the mosquito bite5. While mortality with CHIKV is low  morbidity is high  and the global market for vaccines against chikungunya is estimated to exceed $500 million annually by 20326. Clinical symptoms include acute onset of fever  debilitating joint and muscle pain  headache  nausea  rash and chronic arthralgia. The Chikungunya virus often causes sudden large outbreaks with high attack rates  affecting one-third to three-quarters of the population in areas where the virus is circulating. The high-risk areas of infection for travelers are places where chikungunya virus-carrying mosquitos are endemic  including the Americas  parts of Africa  and Southeast Asia  and the virus has spread to more than 110 countries7. Between 2013 and 2023  more than 3.7 million cases were reported in the Americas8 and the economic impact is considered to be significant. The medical and economic burden is expected to grow as the CHIKV primary mosquito vectors continue to spread geographically. Before IXCHIQ®  there were no preventive vaccines or effective treatments available and  as such  chikungunya is considered to be a major public health threat.To make the vaccine more accessible to Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMIC)  Valneva and Instituto Butantan in Brazil signed an agreement in January 2021 for the development  manufacturing and marketing of IXCHIQ®9. The collaboration falls within the framework of the agreement signed between CEPI and Valneva in July 201910  which provides funding of up to $24.6 million with support from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 program. Regulatory review by the Brazilian authority ANVISA is ongoing.About IXCHIQ®In the U.S.  IXCHIQ® is a live-attenuated vaccine indicated for the prevention of disease caused by chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in individuals 18 years of age and older who are at increased risk of exposure to CHIKV. As for all products approved under FDA’s accelerated approval pathway  continued approval for this indication is contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory studies.Please click here for full U.S. Prescribing Information for IXCHIQ®.About Valneva SEWe are a specialty vaccine company that develops  manufactures  and commercializes prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases addressing unmet medical needs.

These issues and main justifications presented by AB Science are detailed in the presentation. The EMA decision will be made public during the next CHMP meeting to be held on June 24-27  2024.As a next step  AB Science indicated that it has the option to request a re-examination  and that it would liaise with the EMA to define the appropriate pathway to registration. In case of re-examination  a new Rapporteur and new Co-Rapporteur are appointed to assess the dossier  and a Scientific Advisory Group) can be appointed to provide recommendations on key points. Such key points could include: Application of EMA guideline on the Good Clinical Practices (GCP)  application of EMA guideline on subgroup  application of the two recommendations for handling of missing data  and whether excluding Fast progressors from primary analysis is justified.Regarding the conditional approval of masitinib in ALS with Health Canada  AB Science presented the main clinical objections raised by Health Canada  which were slightly different from the ones raised by EMA.Finally  AB Science clarified that a distinction was to be made between the conditional marketing authorization that requires very compelling evidence from a single study  and the available preclinical and clinical data from masitinib program  that are robust and will support full approval  provided a confirmatory study is positive.Masitinib has a validated mechanism of action  targeting the innate immune system  via modulation of mast cells and microglia.

The Company now anticipates that the ADS Ratio Change will be effective on or about June 7th  2024 (the “Effective Date”).For the Company’s ADS holders  the change in the ADS Ratio will have the same effect as a one-for-two reverse ADS split and is intended to enable the Company to regain compliance with the Nasdaq minimum bid price requirement. On the Effective Date  registered holders of company ADSs held in certificated form will be required on a mandatory basis to surrender their certificated ADSs to the depositary bank for cancellation and will receive one (1) new ADS in exchange for every two existing ADSs surrendered. Holders of uncertificated ADSs in the Direct Registration System (“DRS”) and in The Depository Trust Company (“DTC”) will have their ADSs automatically exchanged and need not take any action. The exchange of every two existing ADSs then-held for one (1) new ADS will occur automatically  at the Effective Date  with the then-held ADSs being cancelled and new ADSs being issued by the depositary bank. DBV’s ADSs will continue to be traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the ticker symbol “DBVT”.No fractional new ADSs will be issued in connection with the change in the ADS Ratio. Instead  fractional entitlements to new ADSs will be aggregated and sold by the depositary bank and the net cash proceeds from the sale of the fractional ADS entitlements (after deduction of fees  taxes and expenses) will be distributed to the applicable ADS holders by the depositary bank. The ADS Ratio Change will have no impact on DBV’s underlying ordinary shares  and no ordinary shares will be issued or cancelled in connection with the ADS Ratio Change.As a result of the change in the ADS Ratio  DBV’s ADS trading price is expected to increase proportionally  although the Company can give no assurance that the ADS trading price after the ADS Ratio Change will be equal to or greater than twice the ADS trading price before the change.About DBV TechnologiesDBV Technologies is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing treatment options for food allergies and other immunologic conditions with significant unmet medical need. DBV is currently focused on investigating the use of its proprietary technology platform  Viaskin™  to address food allergies  which are caused by a hypersensitive immune reaction and characterized by a range of symptoms varying in severity from mild to life-threatening anaphylaxis. Millions of people live with food allergies  including young children. Through epicutaneous immunotherapy (EPIT™)  the Viaskin platform is designed to introduce microgram amounts of a biologically active compound to the immune system through intact skin. EPIT is a new class of non-invasive treatment that seeks to modify an individual’s underlying allergy by re-educating the immune system to become desensitized to allergen by leveraging the skin’s immune tolerizing properties.

The effective date for the alteration  originally set for June 3rd  is now anticipated to be around June 7th  2024.Currently  one ADS represents one-half of an ordinary share. The new ratio will adjust to one ADS for one ordinary share  effectively a one-for-two reverse ADS split. Registered holders of certificated ADSs will be mandated to exchange their shares for the new ratio  while holders of uncertificated ADSs in the Direct Registration System and in The Depository Trust Company will have the exchange processed automatically.The company's ordinary shares  with a nominal value of €0.10 each  will remain unaffected by this change  with no shares being issued or cancelled. The change is expected to proportionally increase the trading price of DBV's ADSs  although the company has stated there is no assurance that the post-change trading price will be equal to or greater than twice the pre-change price.DBV Technologies specializes in developing treatments for food allergies and other immunological conditions through its proprietary technology platform  Viaskin™. The company's focus is on epicutaneous immunotherapy (EPIT™)  a non-invasive treatment designed to desensitize the immune system to allergens by leveraging the skin’s immune properties.The ADS ratio modification will not result in the issuance of fractional new ADSs. Instead  fractional entitlements will be aggregated  sold by the depositary bank  and the net proceeds  after deductions  will be distributed to the applicable ADS holders.DBV Technologies  headquartered in Châtillon  France  with North American operations in Warren  NJ  has its ordinary shares traded on Euronext Paris and its ADSs on the Nasdaq Global Select Market. The company has ongoing clinical trials for Viaskin Peanut  aimed at treating peanut allergies in young children.This announcement is based on a press release statement and contains forward-looking statements regarding the expected impact of the ADS Ratio Change on DBV’s trading price and its compliance with Nasdaq regulations. Investors are cautioned that such forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties.InvestingPro InsightsIn light of DBV Technologies' recent announcement regarding the ADS ratio change  investors may be keen to understand the financial health and market performance of the company. InvestingPro data reveals that DBV Technologies has experienced significant revenue growth over the last twelve months as of Q1 2024  with an impressive increase of 232.61%. However  the company's quarterly revenue growth shows a decline of -35.87% in Q1 2024  indicating a potential fluctuation in its financial performance.The company's Price to Book (P/B) ratio stands at 1.12 for the same period  which can be indicative of the market's valuation of the company's net assets. A P/B ratio around or lower than one may suggest that the market might be undervaluing the company’s assets  or that investors are uncertain about the company’s future prospects.InvestingPro Tips suggest that while DBV Technologies has a strong growth profile in terms of revenue  there are aspects of its financial performance that investors should monitor closely. The company's Gross Profit Margin remains at 100%  reflecting the total revenue DBV retains after accounting for the direct costs associated with producing the goods it sells and the services it provides. Additionally  it's worth noting that the InvestingPro Fair Value is calculated at 1.72 USD  which can serve as a reference point for investors trying to determine the stock's potential undervaluation or overvaluation.For those looking to delve deeper into the financial analytics and get additional insights  InvestingPro offers more tips on DBV Technologies and other companies.

If approved  it will become the first chikungunya vaccine available in Europe to address this unmet medical need. In accordance with the International Recognition Procedure (IRP)1  Valneva is also preparing a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for submission to the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).The CHMP opinion follows the November 2023 approval of IXCHIQ® by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)2. Two additional marketing authorization applications are currently under review by Health Canada and the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency (ANVISA) with potential approvals in 2024.Juan Carlos Jaramillo  M.D.  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  commented  “This positive CHMP opinion marks a crucial milestone toward introducing a preventative solution against chikungunya in the EU. In recent years  climate change has caused the Aedes mosquito  a known carrier of chikungunya and dengue viruses  to spread to areas in Europe that were previously unaffected. It is critical to provide a vaccine solution not only to European travelers going to endemic chikungunya areas  such as South America or Africa  but also to the local European populations experiencing invasive mosquito attacks. The broader we can make this vaccine accessible  the better we will mitigate the burden of this debilitating illness  and we would like to thank our partner  CEPI  for supporting us in this endeavor.”Dr. Richard Hatchett  Chief Executive Officer of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI)  commented  “Over one billion people live in areas where Chikungunya is endemic  and recent large outbreaks underline the urgent need for safe and effective vaccines against this debilitating disease. Valneva’s single-dose vaccine is well-suited for use in outbreak response and in low-resource settings  and CEPI’s partnership with Valneva and Instituto Butantan – supported by the EU – will help to make this vaccine accessible to the people most affected by the virus in low- and middle-income countries. Today’s positive opinion from the EMA is an important step towards making the vaccine more widely available.”The positive CHMP opinion is supported by data from the pivotal Phase 3 study which were published in The Lancet  the world’s leading peer-reviewed medical journal  and showed a 98.9% seroresponse rate at 28 days with a single vaccination. This robust immune response was sustained for 24 months by 97% of participants and was equally durable in younger and older adults3. Earlier this month  Valneva reported further positive pivotal data in adolescents six months after a single vaccination  which are intended to support filing for potential label extension for use in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years4. The data are also expected to support licensure of IXCHIQ® in Brazil  which would be the first potential approval for use in an endemic population.About ChikungunyaChikungunya is a mosquito-borne viral disease caused by the chikungunya virus (CHIKV)  a Togaviridae virus  transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Infection leads to symptomatic disease in up to 97% of humans after four to seven days following the mosquito bite5. While mortality with CHIKV is low  morbidity is high  and the global market for vaccines against chikungunya is estimated to exceed $500 million annually by 20326. Clinical symptoms include acute onset of fever  debilitating joint and muscle pain  headache  nausea  rash and chronic arthralgia. The Chikungunya virus often causes sudden large outbreaks with high attack rates  affecting one-third to three-quarters of the population in areas where the virus is circulating. The high-risk areas of infection for travelers are places where chikungunya virus-carrying mosquitos are endemic  including the Americas  parts of Africa  and Southeast Asia  and the virus has spread to more than 110 countries7. Between 2013 and 2023  more than 3.7 million cases were reported in the Americas8 and the economic impact is considered to be significant. The medical and economic burden is expected to grow as the CHIKV primary mosquito vectors continue to spread geographically. Before IXCHIQ®  there were no preventive vaccines or effective treatments available and  as such  chikungunya is considered to be a major public health threat.To make the vaccine more accessible to Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMIC)  Valneva and Instituto Butantan in Brazil signed an agreement in January 2021 for the development  manufacturing and marketing of IXCHIQ®9. The collaboration falls within the framework of the agreement signed between CEPI and Valneva in July 201910  which provides funding of up to $24.6 million with support from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 program. Regulatory review by the Brazilian authority ANVISA is ongoing.About IXCHIQ®In the U.S.  IXCHIQ® is a live-attenuated vaccine indicated for the prevention of disease caused by chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in individuals 18 years of age and older who are at increased risk of exposure to CHIKV. As for all products approved under FDA’s accelerated approval pathway  continued approval for this indication is contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory studies.Please click here for full U.S. Prescribing Information for IXCHIQ®.About Valneva SEWe are a specialty vaccine company that develops  manufactures  and commercializes prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases addressing unmet medical needs.

OTHER RESTRICTIONS ARE APPLICABLE. PLEASE SEE THE IMPORTANT NOTICE AT THE END OF THE PRESS RELEASEShort-term funding successfully raisedTrondheim  Norway-CrayoNano AS (""CrayoNano"" or the ""Company"") is pleased to announce that the Company has executed a private placement raising approximately NOK 13  1 million in gross proceeds through the conditional allocation of 937 288 new preference shares (the ""New Preference Shares"")  each at a subscription price of NOK 14 (the ""Subscription Price"") (the ""Private Placement""). The Subscription Price is above that of the last closing price on the Euronext OTC in Norway  and equal to the subscription price in the private placement carried out by the Company in April 2023.The net proceeds of the Private Placement to the Company will be used for short-term funding  and under the current run rate will support the Company until the end of Q3 2024. Per the Q1 2024 Update issued earlier this month  the Company is in active discussions  some advanced  with several global and other companies. If the Company secures new customer agreements in the near-term with revenue and immediate cash positive effect  this will further extend the cash runway. Additionally  the Company continues to progress longer-term funding discussions  as detailed below.As outlined in the recent Q1 2024 Update  CrayoNano estimates that it will be breakeven with net positive operational cash flow at approximately NOK 150m sales revenue using a +50% gross margin assumption which is our mid-term margin target. To give an idea of the progression to breakeven  the weighted pipeline for 2024 currently shows projected sales revenue of NOK 67m  and NOK 133m for 2025. For further information about the weighted pipeline  including assumptions  please refer to the Q1 2024 update. The sales pipeline contains many large individual potential contracts  so any one of these would materially advance CrayoNano to a breakeven position.CrayoNano currently has ongoing discussions with potential strategic investors with the aim of raising longer-term equity capital. Strategic investors could be companies within the wider related industry with complementary operative- or strategic activities  or other synergy potential. As the Company looks to scale revenue and progresses to breakeven  additional short-term and / or longer-term financing  above that of the proceeds from the Private Placement and proceeds from the potential Repair Offering announced here  will most likely be necessary to support the business. The outcome of these discussions  the amount and terms at which the equity is raised is uncertain at this stage.The Company has explored various financing structures with prospective investors and debt financing to solve its short-term liquidity need to fund ongoing operations and to allow for continuing the process of exploring solutions for its long-term financing. Based on the outcome of these discussions  and in light of the Company's short term liquidity need and support a more flexible process with the aim of securing long term financing  the board of directors of the Company (the ""Board"") is of the opinion that it is in the best interest of the Company to carry out the Private Placement  which involves establishing a new share class with preference shares (the ""Preference Shares"")  which shall have the following rights:In the event of any distribution from the Company  whether in one or several distributions and either through dividends  capital reductions (including demergers)  liquidation  dissolution or winding up of the Company  any funds and assets of the Company available for distribution (whether in the form of cash payment or payment in kind) shall be distributed as follows:First  holders of Preference Shares will receive an amount on each Preference Share equal to 3 times NOK 14  being the subscription price for the Preference Shares upon establishment.Second  any additional amounts will be distributed among the holders of Ordinary Shares and Preference Shares (as deemed converted into Ordinary Shares as set out below) in proportion to their respective holdings of shares in the Company.Immediately after the preference amount under item (i) has been repaid in full to the holders of Preference Shares  each Preference Share shall be deemed converted into one Ordinary Share  and thus have the right to receive any part of additional distributions in line with the other Ordinary Shares under item (ii).If the Company is the transferring company in a merger  the holders of Preference Shares shall retain preference shares in the surviving company where each consideration share shall have the same economic rights as the Preference Shares (less any amount already distributed).Other than the rights set out above the Preference Shares shall have the same rights as the rights attached to the Ordinary Shares.[Among the investors who have conditionally been allocated New Preference Shares is Nordic Technology Group AS  which is represented at the board of directors of CrayoNano through the primary insider and vice chairperson Rune Rinnan.]The Company will call for an extraordinary general meeting expected to be held on or about 13 June 2024 (the ""EGM"") to vote on the following matters (the ""EGM Resolutions""):Changes to the articles of association in order to establish the Preference Shares as a new separate share class with rights as set out above;The share capital increase pertaining to the New Preference Shares; andAn authorisation to the Board of Directors to increase the share capital of the Company in order to facilitate the Subsequent Offering (as defined below) pursuant to which the Company will offer for subscription additional Preference Shares.All of the investors who are allocated New Preference Shares are existing shareholders in the Company or their close associates and have given voting undertakings to vote in favor of the EGM Resolutions.The establishment of the Preference Shares and the completion of the Private Placement is subject to the following conditions: (i) the EGM resolving the EGM Resolutions  (ii) the Company receiving payment for all New Preference Shares allocated in the Private Placement by the respective investors  and (iii) the share capital increase pertaining to the New Preference Shares being registered with the NRBE and the New Preference Shares being validly registered and issued in the VPS.Subject to completion of the Private Placement  the Company's share capital will be NOK 769 235.68 divided into 37 524 496 ordinary shares and 937 288 Preference Shares  each with a nominal value of NOK 0.02.The Private Placement implies a deviation from the existing shareholders' pre-emptive right to subscribe for the Offer Shares. The Board has considered the Private Placement in light of the equal treatment obligations set out in the Private Limited Liability Companies Act and deemed that the proposed Private Placement is in compliance with these obligations. The Company has explored several financing options to support the short-term liquidity  and the Private Placement is considered as the best option and will put the Company in a position to further explore its options to finance the long-term liquidity needs which is in the interest of all shareholders.In light of the structure of the Private Placement with issuance of a new class of Preference Shares with preference economical rights as further set out above  the Board deems it important to allow all existing shareholders not participating in the Private Placement to subscribe New Preference Shares. The Company will accordingly offer existing shareholders as of 30 May 2024 (as registered in the VPS on 3 June 2024) to subscribe for Preference Shares in a subsequent repair offering in order to limit the dilutive effect and give all shareholders an equal opportunity to profit from future distributions (the ""Subsequent Offering""). The Subsequent Offering  if approved  will consist of up to 1 189 204 Preference Shares that can be subscribed at a price equal to the Subscription Price. Shareholders (i) being allocated New Preference Shares in the Private Placement or (ii) who in the sole opinion of the Company have been invited and refusing to participate in the Private Placement will not be eligible to participate in a Subsequent Offering. Subscription without subscription rights and over-subscription will not be permitted. Subscription rights will not be transferable. The potential Subsequent Offering will be subject to  among other things  the EGM passing the EGM Resolutions and approval by the Company's Board of Directors. Launch of a Subsequent Offering will also be contingent upon the publication of a prospectus.On this background  the Board is of the view that the Private Placement considered together with the planned subsequent offering is in compliance with the equal treatment obligations to which the Company is subject and is in the best interest of the Company and its shareholders. The Board has concluded that there is a basis for deviating from the existing shareholders' preferential rights.Through the establishment of the Preference Shares the pricing of the Company's ordinary shares that is subject to registration on N-OTC is more complex. Further  the Company will not apply for registration of the Preference Shares on N-OTC. On this basis  and on the background of expressed interests from the investors of the New Preference Shares  the Board believes it is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders to deregister the ordinary shares from N-OTC. Any deregistration is subject to approval by the EGM and the Oslo Stock Exchange. The board has accordingly resolved to propose that the Company's ordinary shares are deregistered from listing on N-OTC and a proposal in this regard is included on the agenda in the notice to the EGM.The notice for the EGM will be distributed to shareholders and published on or about 30 May 2024.Reference is further made to the announcement made by the Company on 13 May 2024 regarding the appointment of Dr. Thomas Dobbertin as CEO. The Company has resolved to distribute 1 125 734 options to Mr. Dobbertin. Each option gives the right to acquire one Preference Share at an exercise price of NOK 14 per option  however so that any preferred right to receive dividends or other proceeds from the Company or on the shares shall be limited to the exercise price per share. The options shall vest with 1/4 of the options becoming exercisable on each anniversary of the delivery date  being 2 May 2024. Further  the exercise price of the options shall be adjusted to correspond with the share price in any subsequent capital increase carried out by the Company on or before 31 December 2024.Advokatfirmaet Wiersholm AS is acting as legal advisor to the Company.For further information  please contact:Jens Kielland  CFOtel: +47 72 90 98 60email: jens.kielland@crayonano.comAbout CrayoNano ASCrayoNano develops and manufactures nanomaterials-based semiconductor components using proprietary technologies.

42018,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.investing.com/news/press-releases/press-release-update-on-fda-priority-review-of-dupixent-for-the-treatment-of-copd-patients-with-type-2-inflammation-93CH-3464885,Press Release: Update on FDA priority review of Dupixent for the treatment of COPD patients with type 2 inflammation By Investing.com,Press Release: Update on FDA priority review of Dupixent for the treatment of COPD patients with type 2 inflammation,Update on FDA priority review of Dupixent for the treatment of COPD patients with type 2 inflammationParis and Tarrytown  NY May 31  2024. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has extended by three months the target action date of its priority review of the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for Dupixent (dupilumab) as an add-on maintenance treatment in certain adult patients with uncontrolled chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The revised target action date is September 27  2024. The FDA did not raise any concerns regarding the approvability of Dupixent for this indication.The FDA had requested additional efficacy analyses on the efficacy of Dupixent in the BOREAS and NOTUS pivotal trials. Based on the submission of these analyses earlier in May  the agency has now determined that this additional information constituted a major amendment to the sBLA and extended the target action date accordingly.Sanofi (NASDAQ: ) and Regeneron (NASDAQ: ) are confident that the additional analyses strongly support the approval of Dupixent in COPD with evidence of type 2 inflammation  and are committed to working with the FDA to bring Dupixent to patients living with uncontrolled COPD as quickly as possible.Additionally  submissions for Dupixent in COPD are currently under review with regulatory authorities around the world  including the European Union and China. Recently  the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion and recommended the approval of Dupixent as an add-on maintenance treatment in adults with uncontrolled COPD characterized by raised blood eosinophils. The potential use of Dupixent in COPD is currently under clinical development  and the safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About BOREAS and NOTUS TrialsThe sBLA is supported by data from the landmark BOREAS and NOTUS phase 3 studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in adults who were current or former smokers with uncontrolled COPD with type 2 inflammation (measured by blood eosinophils ‰¥300 cells/microliter). All patients were on background maximal standard-of-care inhaled therapy (nearly all on triple therapy). The primary endpoint was met in both studies  showing Dupixent significantly reduced annualized moderate or severe acute COPD exacerbations by up to 34%  compared to placebo. Dupixent rapidly and significantly improved lung function compared to placebo  with improvements sustained at 52 weeks.Safety results in both studies were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. Adverse events more commonly observed with Dupixent ( ‰¥5%) compared to placebo in either study were back pain  COVID-19  diarrhea  headache and nasopharyngitis.About COPDCOPD is a respiratory disease that damages the lungs and causes progressive lung function decline. Symptoms include persistent cough  excessive mucus production and shortness of breath that may impair the ability to perform routine daily activities  which may lead to sleep disturbances  anxiety and depression. COPD is also associated with a significant health and economic burden due to recurrent acute exacerbations that require systemic corticosteroid treatment and/or lead to hospitalization. Smoking and exposure to noxious particles are key risk factors for COPD  but even individuals who quit smoking can still develop or continue having the disease. There have been no new treatment approaches approved for more than a decade. In the US  approximately 300 000 people live with uncontrolled COPD with evidence of type 2 inflammation.About Sanofi and Regeneron's COPD Clinical Research ProgramSanofi and Regeneron are motivated to transform the treatment paradigm of COPD by examining the role different types of inflammation play in the disease progression through the investigation of two potentially first-in-class biologics  Dupixent and itepekimab.Dupixent inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and the program focuses on a specific population of people with evidence of type 2 inflammation. Itepekimab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits interleukin-33 (IL-33)  an initiator and amplifier of broad inflammation in COPD.Itepekimab is currently under clinical investigation  with two phase 3 studies currently enrolling  and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.About DupixentDupixent is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in phase 3 studies  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent  such as atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)  prurigo nodularis and chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU).Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP  EoE  prurigo nodularis and CSU in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in Europe  the US and Japan. More than 850 000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical studies involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in phase 3 studies  including chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritus of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About RegeneronRegeneron (NASDAQ: REGN) is a leading biotechnology company that invents  develops and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

The...,Update on FDA priority review of Dupixent for the treatment of COPD patients with type 2 inflammationParis and Tarrytown  NY May 31  2024. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has extended by three months the target action date of its priority review of the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for Dupixent (dupilumab) as an add-on maintenance treatment in certain adult patients with uncontrolled chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The revised target action date is September 27  2024. The FDA did not raise any concerns regarding the approvability of Dupixent for this indication.The FDA had requested additional efficacy analyses on the efficacy of Dupixent in the BOREAS and NOTUS pivotal trials. Based on the submission of these analyses earlier in May  the agency has now determined that this additional information constituted a major amendment to the sBLA and extended the target action date accordingly.Sanofi and Regeneron are confident that the additional analyses strongly support the approval of Dupixent in COPD with evidence of type 2 inflammation  and are committed to working with the FDA to bring Dupixent to patients living with uncontrolled COPD as quickly as possible.Additionally  submissions for Dupixent in COPD are currently under review with regulatory authorities around the world  including the European Union and China. Recently  the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion and recommended the approval of Dupixent as an add-on maintenance treatment in adults with uncontrolled COPD characterized by raised blood eosinophils. The potential use of Dupixent in COPD is currently under clinical development  and the safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About BOREAS and NOTUS TrialsThe sBLA is supported by data from the landmark BOREAS and NOTUS phase 3 studies evaluating the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in adults who were current or former smokers with uncontrolled COPD with type 2 inflammation (measured by blood eosinophils ≥300 cells/microliter). All patients were on background maximal standard-of-care inhaled therapy (nearly all on triple therapy). The primary endpoint was met in both studies  showing Dupixent significantly reduced annualized moderate or severe acute COPD exacerbations by up to 34%  compared to placebo. Dupixent rapidly and significantly improved lung function compared to placebo  with improvements sustained at 52 weeks.Safety results in both studies were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. Adverse events more commonly observed with Dupixent (≥5%) compared to placebo in either study were back pain  COVID-19  diarrhea  headache and nasopharyngitis.About COPDCOPD is a respiratory disease that damages the lungs and causes progressive lung function decline. Symptoms include persistent cough  excessive mucus production and shortness of breath that may impair the ability to perform routine daily activities  which may lead to sleep disturbances  anxiety and depression. COPD is also associated with a significant health and economic burden due to recurrent acute exacerbations that require systemic corticosteroid treatment and/or lead to hospitalization. Smoking and exposure to noxious particles are key risk factors for COPD  but even individuals who quit smoking can still develop or continue having the disease. There have been no new treatment approaches approved for more than a decade. In the US  approximately 300 000 people live with uncontrolled COPD with evidence of type 2 inflammation.About Sanofi and Regeneron’s COPD Clinical Research ProgramSanofi and Regeneron are motivated to transform the treatment paradigm of COPD by examining the role different types of inflammation play in the disease progression through the investigation of two potentially first-in-class biologics  Dupixent and itepekimab.Dupixent inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and the program focuses on a specific population of people with evidence of type 2 inflammation. Itepekimab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits interleukin-33 (IL-33)  an initiator and amplifier of broad inflammation in COPD.Itepekimab is currently under clinical investigation  with two phase 3 studies currently enrolling  and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.About DupixentDupixent is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in phase 3 studies  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent  such as atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)  prurigo nodularis and chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU).Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP  EoE  prurigo nodularis and CSU in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in Europe  the US and Japan. More than 850 000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical studies involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in phase 3 studies  including chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritus of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About RegeneronRegeneron (NASDAQ: REGN) is a leading biotechnology company that invents  develops and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

May 31  2024. The European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion recommending the approval of Dupixent (dupilumab) in the European Union (EU) as an add-on maintenance treatment in adults with uncontrolled chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) characterized by raised blood eosinophils. The European Commission is expected to announce a final decision on the Dupixent application in the coming months.COPD is a respiratory disease that damages the lungs and causes progressive lung function decline and is the fourth leading cause of death worldwide. Symptoms include persistent cough  excessive mucus production and shortness of breath that may impair the ability to perform routine daily activities  which may lead to sleep disturbances  anxiety and depression. COPD is also associated with a significant health and economic burden due to recurrent acute exacerbations that require systemic corticosteroid treatment and/or lead to hospitalization. Smoking and exposure to noxious particles are key risk factors for COPD  but even individuals who quit smoking can still develop or continue having the disease. There have been no new treatment approaches approved for more than a decade.The positive CHMP opinion is supported by data from the landmark BOREAS and NOTUS phase 3 studies that evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in adults with uncontrolled COPD with evidence of type 2 inflammation (i.e.  blood eosinophils ‰¥300 cells per Î¼L). All patients were on background maximal standard-of-care inhaled therapy (nearly all on triple therapy). The primary endpoint was met in both studies  showing Dupixent significantly reduced annualized moderate or severe acute COPD exacerbations by up to 34% compared to placebo. Dupixent rapidly and significantly improved lung function compared to placebo  with improvements sustained at 52 weeks. Additionally  Dupixent improved health-related quality of life at 52 weeks (statistically significant in BOREAS and nominally significant in NOTUS) as assessed by the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ).Safety results in both studies were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. Adverse events more commonly observed with Dupixent ( ‰¥5%) compared to placebo in either study were back pain  COVID-19  diarrhea  headache and nasopharyngitis.Submissions are also under review with regulatory authorities around the world  including in the U.S. and China. Earlier this year  the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted for Priority Review the supplemental Biologics License Application for Dupixent as an add-on maintenance treatment in certain adult patients with uncontrolled COPD. The target action date is September 27  2024.The use of Dupixent in COPD is investigational and is not yet approved by global regulatory authorities.About Sanofi (NASDAQ: ) and Regeneron (NASDAQ: )'s COPD Clinical Research ProgramSanofi and Regeneron are motivated to transform the treatment paradigm of COPD by examining the role different types of inflammation play in the disease progression through the investigation of two potentially first-in-class biologics  Dupixent and itepekimab.Dupixent inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and the program focuses on a specific population of people with evidence of type 2 inflammation.

The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in phase 3 studies  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in more than 60 countries in one or more indications including certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)  prurigo nodularis and chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) in different age populations. More than 850 000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical studies involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in phase 3 studies  including chronic pruritus of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About RegeneronRegeneron (NASDAQ: REGN) is a leading biotechnology company that invents  develops and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

May 31  2024. The European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion recommending the approval of Dupixent (dupilumab) in the European Union (EU) as an add-on maintenance treatment in adults with uncontrolled chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) characterized by raised blood eosinophils. The European Commission is expected to announce a final decision on the Dupixent application in the coming months.COPD is a respiratory disease that damages the lungs and causes progressive lung function decline and is the fourth leading cause of death worldwide. Symptoms include persistent cough  excessive mucus production and shortness of breath that may impair the ability to perform routine daily activities  which may lead to sleep disturbances  anxiety and depression. COPD is also associated with a significant health and economic burden due to recurrent acute exacerbations that require systemic corticosteroid treatment and/or lead to hospitalization. Smoking and exposure to noxious particles are key risk factors for COPD  but even individuals who quit smoking can still develop or continue having the disease. There have been no new treatment approaches approved for more than a decade.The positive CHMP opinion is supported by data from the landmark BOREAS and NOTUS phase 3 studies that evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in adults with uncontrolled COPD with evidence of type 2 inflammation (i.e.  blood eosinophils ≥300 cells per μL). All patients were on background maximal standard-of-care inhaled therapy (nearly all on triple therapy). The primary endpoint was met in both studies  showing Dupixent significantly reduced annualized moderate or severe acute COPD exacerbations by up to 34% compared to placebo. Dupixent rapidly and significantly improved lung function compared to placebo  with improvements sustained at 52 weeks. Additionally  Dupixent improved health-related quality of life at 52 weeks (statistically significant in BOREAS and nominally significant in NOTUS) as assessed by the St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ).Safety results in both studies were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. Adverse events more commonly observed with Dupixent (≥5%) compared to placebo in either study were back pain  COVID-19  diarrhea  headache and nasopharyngitis.Submissions are also under review with regulatory authorities around the world  including in the U.S. and China. Earlier this year  the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted for Priority Review the supplemental Biologics License Application for Dupixent as an add-on maintenance treatment in certain adult patients with uncontrolled COPD.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi (NASDAQ: ) today announced that the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion recommending the approval of Dupixent ® (dupilumab) in the European Union (EU) as an add-on maintenance treatment in adults with uncontrolled chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) characterized by raised blood eosinophils. The European Commission is expected to announce a final decision on the Dupixent application in the coming months.COPD is a respiratory disease that damages the lungs and causes progressive lung function decline  and is the fourth leading cause of death worldwide. Symptoms include persistent cough  excessive mucus production and shortness of breath that may impair the ability to perform routine daily activities  which may lead to sleep disturbances  anxiety and depression. COPD is also associated with a significant health and economic burden due to recurrent acute exacerbations that require systemic corticosteroid treatment and/or lead to hospitalization. Smoking and exposure to noxious particles are key risk factors for COPD  but even individuals who quit smoking can still develop or continue having the disease. There have been no new treatment approaches approved for more than a decade.The positive CHMP opinion is supported by data from the landmark BOREAS and NOTUS Phase 3 trials that evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in adults with uncontrolled COPD with evidence of type 2 inflammation (i.e.  blood eosinophils ‰¥300 cells per Î¼L). All patients were on background maximal standard-of-care inhaled therapy (nearly all on triple therapy). The primary endpoint was met in both trials  showing Dupixent significantly reduced annualized moderate or severe acute COPD exacerbations by up to 34% compared to placebo. Dupixent rapidly and significantly improved lung function compared to placebo  with improvements sustained at 52 weeks. Additionally  Dupixent improved health-related quality of life at 52 weeks (statistically significant in BOREAS and nominally significant in NOTUS) as assessed by the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ).Safety results in both trials were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. Adverse events more commonly observed with Dupixent ( ‰¥5%) compared to placebo in either trial were back pain  COVID-19  diarrhea  headache and nasopharyngitis.Submissions are also under review with regulatory authorities around the world  including in the U.S. and China. Earlier this year  the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted for Priority Review the supplemental Biologics License Application for Dupixent as an add-on maintenance treatment in certain adult patients with uncontrolled COPD. The target action date is September 27  2024.The use of Dupixent in COPD is investigational and is not yet approved by global regulatory authorities.About Regeneron and Sanofi's COPD Clinical Research ProgramRegeneron and Sanofi are motivated to transform the treatment paradigm of COPD by examining the role different types of inflammation play in the disease progression through the investigation of two potentially first-in-class biologics  Dupixent and itepekimab.Dupixent inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and the program focuses on a specific population of people with evidence of type 2 inflammation. Itepekimab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits interleukin-33 (IL-33)  an initiator and amplifier of broad inflammation in COPD.Itepekimab is currently under clinical investigation  with two Phase 3 trials currently enrolling  and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.About DupixentDupixent  which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune ® technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in more than 60 countries in one or more indications including certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)  prurigo nodularis and chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) in different age populations. More than 850 000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.About Regeneron's VelocImmune ® TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder  President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite ® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create a substantial proportion of all original  FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes REGEN-COV ® (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Dupixent  Libtayo ® (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent ® (alirocumab)  Kevzara ® (sarilumab)  Evkeeza ® (evinacumab-dgnb)  Inmazeb ® (atoltivimab  maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn) and Veopoz™ (pozelimab-bbfg).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including chronic pruritus of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. INDICATIONSDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe eczema (atopic dermatitis or AD) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi (NASDAQ: ) today announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has extended by three months the target action date of its priority review of the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for Dupixent ® (dupilumab) as an add-on maintenance treatment in certain adult patients with uncontrolled chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The revised target action date is September 27  2024. The FDA did not raise any concerns regarding the approvability of Dupixent for this indication.The FDA had requested additional analyses on the efficacy of Dupixent in the BOREAS and NOTUS pivotal trials. Based on the submission of these analyses earlier in May  the agency has now determined that this additional information constituted a major amendment to the sBLA and extended the target action date accordingly.Regeneron and Sanofi are confident that the additional analyses strongly support the approval of Dupixent in COPD with evidence of type 2 inflammation  and are committed to working with the FDA to bring Dupixent to patients living with uncontrolled COPD as quickly as possible.Additionally  submissions for Dupixent in COPD are currently under review with regulatory authorities around the world  including the European Union (EU) and China. Recently  the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion and recommended the approval of Dupixent as an add-on maintenance treatment in adults with uncontrolled COPD characterized by raised blood eosinophils. The potential use of Dupixent in COPD is currently under clinical development  and the safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About the BOREAS and NOTUS TrialsThe sBLA is supported by data from the landmark BOREAS and NOTUS Phase 3 trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in adults who were current or former smokers with uncontrolled COPD with type 2 inflammation (i.e.  blood eosinophils ‰¥300 cells per Î¼L). All patients were on background maximal standard-of-care inhaled therapy (nearly all on triple therapy).The primary endpoint was met in both trials  showing Dupixent significantly reduced annualized moderate or severe acute COPD exacerbations by up to 34%  compared to placebo. Dupixent rapidly and significantly improved lung function compared to placebo  with improvements sustained at 52 weeks.Safety results in both trials were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. Adverse events more commonly observed with Dupixent ( ‰¥5%) compared to placebo in either trial were back pain  COVID-19  diarrhea  headache and nasopharyngitis.About COPDCOPD is a respiratory disease that damages the lungs and causes progressive lung function decline. Symptoms include persistent cough  excessive mucus production and shortness of breath that may impair the ability to perform routine daily activities  which may lead to sleep disturbances  anxiety and depression. COPD is also associated with a significant health and economic burden due to recurrent acute exacerbations that require systemic corticosteroid treatment and/or lead to hospitalization. Smoking and exposure to noxious particles are key risk factors for COPD  but even individuals who quit smoking can still develop or continue having the disease. There have been no new treatment approaches approved for more than a decade. In the U.S.  approximately 300 000 people live with uncontrolled COPD with evidence of type 2 inflammation.About Regeneron and Sanofi's COPD Clinical Research ProgramRegeneron and Sanofi are motivated to transform the treatment paradigm of COPD by examining the role different types of inflammation play in the disease progression through the investigation of two potentially first-in-class biologics  Dupixent and itepekimab.Dupixent inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and the program focuses on a specific population of people with evidence of type 2 inflammation. Itepekimab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits interleukin-33 (IL-33)  an initiator and amplifier of broad inflammation in COPD.Itepekimab is currently under clinical investigation  with two Phase 3 trials currently enrolling  and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.About DupixentDupixent  which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune ® technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases. These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent  such as atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)  prurigo nodularis and chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU).Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP  EoE  prurigo nodularis or CSU in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in Europe  the U.S. and Japan. Approximately 850 000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.About Regeneron's VelocImmune ® TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder  President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite ® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create a substantial portion of all original  FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes REGEN-COV ® (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Dupixent  Libtayo ® (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent ® (alirocumab)  Kevzara ® (sarilumab)  Evkeeza ® (evinacumab-dgnb) and Inmazeb ® (atoltivimab  maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including chronic spontaneous urticaria  chronic pruritus of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. INDICATIONSDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe eczema (atopic dermatitis or AD) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies.

The European Commission is expected to announce a final decision on the Dupixent application in the coming months.COPD is a respiratory disease that damages the lungs and causes progressive lung function decline  and is the fourth leading cause of death worldwide. Symptoms include persistent cough  excessive mucus production and shortness of breath that may impair the ability to perform routine daily activities  which may lead to sleep disturbances  anxiety and depression. COPD is also associated with a significant health and economic burden due to recurrent acute exacerbations that require systemic corticosteroid treatment and/or lead to hospitalization. Smoking and exposure to noxious particles are key risk factors for COPD  but even individuals who quit smoking can still develop or continue having the disease. There have been no new treatment approaches approved for more than a decade.The positive CHMP opinion is supported by data from the landmark BOREAS and NOTUS Phase 3 trials that evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in adults with uncontrolled COPD with evidence of type 2 inflammation (i.e.  blood eosinophils ≥300 cells per μL). All patients were on background maximal standard-of-care inhaled therapy (nearly all on triple therapy). The primary endpoint was met in both trials  showing Dupixent significantly reduced annualized moderate or severe acute COPD exacerbations by up to 34% compared to placebo. Dupixent rapidly and significantly improved lung function compared to placebo  with improvements sustained at 52 weeks. Additionally  Dupixent improved health-related quality of life at 52 weeks (statistically significant in BOREAS and nominally significant in NOTUS) as assessed by the St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ).Safety results in both trials were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. Adverse events more commonly observed with Dupixent (≥5%) compared to placebo in either trial were back pain  COVID-19  diarrhea  headache and nasopharyngitis.Submissions are also under review with regulatory authorities around the world  including in the U.S. and China. Earlier this year  the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted for Priority Review the supplemental Biologics License Application for Dupixent as an add-on maintenance treatment in certain adult patients with uncontrolled COPD. The target action date is September 27  2024.The use of Dupixent in COPD is investigational and is not yet approved by global regulatory authorities.About Regeneron and Sanofi’s COPD Clinical Research ProgramRegeneron and Sanofi are motivated to transform the treatment paradigm of COPD by examining the role different types of inflammation play in the disease progression through the investigation of two potentially first-in-class biologics  Dupixent and itepekimab.Dupixent inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and the program focuses on a specific population of people with evidence of type 2 inflammation. Itepekimab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits interleukin-33 (IL-33)  an initiator and amplifier of broad inflammation in COPD.Itepekimab is currently under clinical investigation  with two Phase 3 trials currently enrolling  and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.About DupixentDupixent  which was invented using Regeneron’s proprietary VelocImmune® technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in more than 60 countries in one or more indications including certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)  prurigo nodularis and chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU) in different age populations. More than 850 000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.About Regeneron's VelocImmune® TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder  President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create a substantial proportion of all original  FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Dupixent  Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent® (alirocumab)  Kevzara® (sarilumab)  Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb)  Inmazeb® (atoltivimab  maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn) and Veopoz™ (pozelimab-bbfg).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including chronic pruritus of unknown origin  chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with evidence of type 2 inflammation and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. INDICATIONSDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe eczema (atopic dermatitis or AD) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has extended by three months the target action date of its priority review of the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for Dupixent® (dupilumab) as an add-on maintenance treatment in certain adult patients with uncontrolled chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The revised target action date is September 27  2024. The FDA did not raise any concerns regarding the approvability of Dupixent for this indication.The FDA had requested additional analyses on the efficacy of Dupixent in the BOREAS and NOTUS pivotal trials. Based on the submission of these analyses earlier in May  the agency has now determined that this additional information constituted a major amendment to the sBLA and extended the target action date accordingly.Regeneron and Sanofi are confident that the additional analyses strongly support the approval of Dupixent in COPD with evidence of type 2 inflammation  and are committed to working with the FDA to bring Dupixent to patients living with uncontrolled COPD as quickly as possible.Additionally  submissions for Dupixent in COPD are currently under review with regulatory authorities around the world  including the European Union (EU) and China. Recently  the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion and recommended the approval of Dupixent as an add-on maintenance treatment in adults with uncontrolled COPD characterized by raised blood eosinophils. The potential use of Dupixent in COPD is currently under clinical development  and the safety and efficacy have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About the BOREAS and NOTUS TrialsThe sBLA is supported by data from the landmark BOREAS and NOTUS Phase 3 trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in adults who were current or former smokers with uncontrolled COPD with type 2 inflammation (i.e.  blood eosinophils ≥300 cells per μL). All patients were on background maximal standard-of-care inhaled therapy (nearly all on triple therapy).The primary endpoint was met in both trials  showing Dupixent significantly reduced annualized moderate or severe acute COPD exacerbations by up to 34%  compared to placebo. Dupixent rapidly and significantly improved lung function compared to placebo  with improvements sustained at 52 weeks.Safety results in both trials were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. Adverse events more commonly observed with Dupixent (≥5%) compared to placebo in either trial were back pain  COVID-19  diarrhea  headache and nasopharyngitis.About COPDCOPD is a respiratory disease that damages the lungs and causes progressive lung function decline. Symptoms include persistent cough  excessive mucus production and shortness of breath that may impair the ability to perform routine daily activities  which may lead to sleep disturbances  anxiety and depression. COPD is also associated with a significant health and economic burden due to recurrent acute exacerbations that require systemic corticosteroid treatment and/or lead to hospitalization. Smoking and exposure to noxious particles are key risk factors for COPD  but even individuals who quit smoking can still develop or continue having the disease. There have been no new treatment approaches approved for more than a decade. In the U.S.  approximately 300 000 people live with uncontrolled COPD with evidence of type 2 inflammation.About Regeneron and Sanofi’s COPD Clinical Research ProgramRegeneron and Sanofi are motivated to transform the treatment paradigm of COPD by examining the role different types of inflammation play in the disease progression through the investigation of two potentially first-in-class biologics  Dupixent and itepekimab.Dupixent inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and the program focuses on a specific population of people with evidence of type 2 inflammation.

These diseases include approved indications for Dupixent  such as atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP)  eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE)  prurigo nodularis and chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU).Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in one or more countries around the world for use in certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  CRSwNP  EoE  prurigo nodularis or CSU in different age populations. Dupixent is currently approved for one or more of these indications in more than 60 countries  including in Europe  the U.S. and Japan. Approximately 850 000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.About Regeneron's VelocImmune® TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies.
