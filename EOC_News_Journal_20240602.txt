The growth objective reflects the projected contributions of the different geographies: France: CAGR 2023-2026 > 5%  based in particular on an occupancy rate in nursing homes that gradually rises to 93% in 2028  Germany: CAGR 2023-2026 c. 7%  pro forma for the 10% of sites that the Group wishes to cease operating  Belgium & Netherlands: CAGR 2023-2026 > 8%  based in particular on the growth of the network in the Netherlands  with the number of facilities in operation rising from 52 to 90  and an occupancy rate in nursing homes in Belgium that gradually rises to 97% by 2027  Italy: CAGR 2023-2026 2% to 3%  based in particular on an occupancy rate in nursing homes that gradually rises to 98% by 2028  Spain: CAGR 2023-2026 > 15%  75% of which will be generated by service contracts.Across the different geographies  and based on the contributions reflected above  the business segments are expected to evolve as follows:Long term care: 3% to 5% annual organic growth Specialty care: 4% to 6% annual organic growth Community Care: > 10% annual organic growth.an improvement objective of 100 to 150 basis points in its pre-IFRS16 EBITDA margin at 31 December 2026 compared with 12.2% at 31 December 2023  driven mainly by revenue growth  notably through occupancy rates and the development of outpatient services  as well as by targeted improvement measures relating to its central cost structure  rent and energy costs and  finally  an improvement in performance in Germany;a financial leverage objective of less than 3.0x at 31 December 2025 and an LTV of 55% for real estate debt at the same date  reflecting the Strenghtening Plan but also investment discipline with limited levels of investment: around €100 million a year for building maintenance and around €200 million in total for development investment including real estate and an EBITDA to free cash flow conversion rate of around 40% from 2024. In this context  the level of net financial debt1 in 2026  excluding IFRS 16 debt  should be brought down to around €2.7 to €3 billion  with expected real estate debt of around €1.4 billion  giving an LTV of around 55% (assuming a capitalisation rate of 6.7%) and non-real estate debt of around €1.3 to €1.6 billion.At the same time  the Group has set the following ESG targets for 2026:7 000 employees enrolled in a qualifying path through the Clariane UniversityNPS maintained above 40Lost-time injury frequency rate down to 29Implementing the SBTi commitments on the carbon trajectoryThe Company points out that the documentation for the syndicated loan of €505 million renewed on 25 July 2023 prohibits the distribution of dividends as long as the leverage ratio remains above 3.5x and limits it to 40% of net income in all cases. Against this background  no dividend will be paid in 2024 in respect of the 2023 financial year  as leverage stood at 3.8x at 31 December 2023. The Company's objective is to achieve a leverage ratio of significantly less than 3x by the end of 2025. No dividend policy has been adopted for 2024  apart from the constraints imposed by the syndicated loan.Upcoming events:10 June 2024 - Annual General Meeting5 August 2024 - Sales and results for the 1er half-year 202423 October 2024 - Sales for the 3ème quarter 2024General informationThe French version of the 2023 Universal Registration Document and the Amendment are available on Clariane's website (www.clariane.com - Investor Relations) and on the AMF website (www.amf-france.org).

September wheat on Paris-based Euronext settled 0.3% higher on the day at 259.25 euros ($281.16) a metric ton.,PARIS: Euronext wheat ticked up on Friday  consolidating after a volatile month during which prices surged on the back of deteriorating harvest prospects in leading exporter Russia. September wheat on Paris-based Euronext settled 0.3% higher on the day at 259.25 euros ($281.16) a metric ton.Over May  the contract posted a 14% gain  though it ended the month well below a one-year high of 269.25 euros struck on Monday. “Russia’s lack of rainfall and depleted soil moisture in key growing areas is widely being discussed in all corners of the global market ” consultancy CRM Agri said in a note.Analysts have cut Russian wheat harvest estimates by around 10 million metric tons this month due to dryness and frosts  unsettling a market that has become used to massive production and exports from the country.Forecasts of rain in Russia helped curb prices towards the end of the week  though with temperatures rising analysts were cautious about the benefit to crops. Higher Russian prices have created hopes of export demand for German and other Baltic region wheat. There was market talk of Russian exporters inquiring about EU wheat to replace Russian supplies earmarked for Saudi Arabia.However  EU prices were still relatively high and demand thin  with recent prices deterring importers. “Export demand remains quiet  with few tenders in the market  while cheap Ukrainian wheat continues to get internal EU sales ” a German trader said.Russian 12.5% protein wheat for June Black Sea shipment was little changed from Thursday at around $252 a ton FOB  up $2 since Monday. German 12.5% wheat for June shipment was much higher at just over $270 a ton FOB despite negative differentials of 6 to 7 euros under Euronext September  traders said.Traders said large handysize sea consignments of Ukrainian feed wheat for June were offered to importers in north Spain at around 234 euros c&f  equivalent to differentials of 31 euros c&f under Euronext September.Ukrainian new crop 11% wheat was purchased by north Italian buyers this week at 235 euros a ton including delivery by train. In France  the condition of soft wheat worsened again last week  data from farm office FranceAgriMer showed  and traders were assessing the risk of a further deterioration during heavy rain this week before a sunny spell forecast for next week.The condition of French soft wheat continued to deteriorate last week as wet weather persisted in crop belts  with the share of the crop in good or excellent condition falling to the lowest level this growing season and remaining at a four-year low.Grain crops in France  the European Union’s largest producer  like in other parts of Western Europe have suffered from particularly wet weather since plantings  with heavy rain delaying sowings and flooding fields.Sunny weather early this month had helped crops and soil dry out  but showers have resumed in the past three weeks  raising concerns of damage to the maturing wheat and barley while preventing farmers from completing maize planting.,neutral,0.06,0.91,0.04,mixed,0.07,0.18,0.75,True,English,"['EU wheat', 'weather-fuelled rally', 'large handysize sea consignments', 'other Baltic region wheat', 'June Black Sea shipment', 'Russian wheat harvest estimates', 'Ukrainian new crop 11% wheat', 'deteriorating harvest prospects', 'cheap Ukrainian wheat', 'Ukrainian feed wheat', 'key growing areas', 'past three weeks', 'Russian 12.5% protein wheat', '10 million metric tons', 'north Italian buyers', 'sunny spell forecast', 'internal EU sales', 'French soft wheat', 'leading exporter Russia', 'Higher Russian prices', 'June shipment', 'EU wheat', 'other parts', 'Russian exporters', 'Russian supplies', 'Euronext wheat', 'September wheat', 'maturing wheat', 'north Spain', 'Sunny weather', 'German 12.5% wheat', 'crop belts', 'EU prices', 'Paris-based Euronext', 'CRM Agri', 'massive production', 'Saudi Arabia', 'Euronext September', 'farm office', 'wet weather', 'lowest level', 'European Union', 'largest producer', 'Western Europe', 'flooding fields', 'maize planting', 'recent prices', 'export demand', 'German trader', 'heavy rain', 'volatile month', 'soil moisture', 'global market', 'market talk', 'ton FOB', 'negative differentials', 'next week', 'excellent condition', 'Grain crops', '6 to 7 euros', '259.25 euros', '269.25 euros', '234 euros', '31 euros', '235 euros', 'Friday', 'back', 'May', 'contract', '14% gain', 'one-year', 'Monday', 'rainfall', 'depleted', 'corners', 'consultancy', 'note', 'Analysts', 'dryness', 'frosts', 'exports', 'country', 'Forecasts', 'end', 'temperatures', 'benefit', 'hopes', 'importers', 'Thursday', 'traders', 'delivery', 'train', 'France', 'data', 'risk', 'deterioration', 'share', 'good', 'four-year', 'plantings', 'sowings', 'showers', 'concerns', 'damage', 'barley', 'farmers']",2024-06-02,2024-06-02,brecorder.com
