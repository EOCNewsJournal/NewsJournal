These data were presented by Study 1100 Coordinating Investigator Colette Shen  MD  PhD  at the 2024 Annual Meeting of the American Society for Clinical Oncology (“ASCO 2024”).“Novel approaches to improving response rates and reversing resistance to anti-PD-1 are an urgent unmet need for patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer ” said Study 1100 Coordinating Investigator Ari Rosenberg  MD. “The opportunity to ‘prime’ immune activity prior to the administration of anti-PD-1 through radiotherapy-activated NBTXR3’s unique mechanism of action represents a promising potential new treatment approach for patients.”Abstract #6035: Early signs of efficacy in patients with anti-PD-1 naïve and anti-PD-1 resistant HNSCC treated with NBTXR3/SBRT in combination with nivolumab and pembrolizumab in the phase 1 trial Study 1100Colette Shen11  Jessica Frakes2  Trevor Hackman1  Jiaxin Niu3  Jared Weiss1  Jimmy Caudell2  George Yang2  Tanguy Seiwert4  Paul Chang5  Septimiu Murgu5  Siddharth Sheth1  Shetal Patel1  Kedar Kirtane2  David Rolando6  Pavel Tyan6  Omar I.

However  it is clear that many of these new product candidates are prioritizing patients in specific settings  while NBTXR3 remains active regardless of several prior prognostic factors such as lines of therapy  CPS score  HPV status  and resistance to therapy ” said Louis Kayitalire  Nanobiotix chief medical officer. “In Study 1100  NBTXR3’s unique mechanism of action could enable a broader population of patients to potentially benefit from therapy  and we look forward to continuing to develop radiotherapy-activated NBTXR3 followed by anti-PD-1 for the treatment of recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer.”Investigators concluded that promising early signals of efficacy were observed in Study 1100 patients with naïve or resistant 2L+ R/M-HNSCC who received RT-activated NBTXR3 followed by anti-PD-1. Disease control was observed in both naïve and resistant R/M-HNSCC patients  highlighting the potential for NBTXR3 in this population. Overall  these results warrant further exploration in randomized trials for both naïve and resistant R/M-HNSCC patients.“These new data from Study 1100 continue to provide encouraging signals that radiotherapy-activated NBTXR3 followed by anti-PD-1 could potentially improve response rates and reverse resistance to anti-PD-1 in patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer ” said Study 1100 Coordinating Investigator Colette Shen  MD  PhD. “The safety  feasibility  and early signals of efficacy we have observed to date support further evaluation in randomized clinical trials.”Nanobiotix expects to provide first data from cohort 3 of the Study 1100 dose expansion part (advanced cancers other than R/M-HNSCC with lung  liver  or soft tissue metastases) in 2025.Nanobiotix Investor CallNanobiotix will host a conference call and webcast featuring Nanobiotix chief executive officer and chairman of the executive board  Laurent Levy  following the poster session on Sunday June 2nd  2024  at 12:00 PM EDT / 6:00 PM CEST.Details for the call are as follows :Audio-only dial-in link: click hereWebcast link: click hereParticipants can use the audio-only link above to register and obtain dial-in instructions to listen to the presentation via phone and ask questions during the Q&A session  or participants can use the webcast link to register and listen and watch the slide presentation online; the replay version will be available under the same webcast link shortly after the presentation and will be archived on the Company’s website at www.nanobiotix.com. It is recommended to join 10 minutes prior to the event start. Participants are invited to email their questions in advance to investors@nanobiotix.com .About NBTXR3NBTXR3 is a novel  potentially first-in-class oncology product composed of functionalized hafnium oxide nanoparticles that is administered via one-time intratumoral injection and activated by radiotherapy. Its proof-of-concept was achieved in soft tissue sarcomas for which the product received a European CE mark in 2019. The product candidate’s physical mechanism of action (MoA) is designed to induce significant tumor cell death in the injected tumor when activated by radiotherapy  subsequently triggering adaptive immune response and long-term anti-cancer memory. Given the physical MoA  Nanobiotix believes that NBTXR3 could be scalable across any solid tumor that can be treated with radiotherapy and across any therapeutic combination  particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors.Radiotherapy-activated NBTXR3 is being evaluated across multiple solid tumor indications as a single agent or in combination with anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors  including in NANORAY-312—a global  randomized Phase 3 study in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell cancers. In February 2020  the United States Food and Drug Administration granted regulatory Fast Track designation for the investigation of NBTXR3 activated by radiation therapy  with or without cetuximab  for the treatment of patients with locally advanced HNSCC who are not eligible for platinum-based chemotherapy—the same population being evaluated in the Phase 3 study.Given the Company’s focus areas  and balanced against the scalable potential of NBTXR3  Nanobiotix has engaged in a collaboration strategy to expand development of the product candidate in parallel with its priority development pathways. Pursuant to this strategy  in 2019 Nanobiotix entered into a broad  comprehensive clinical research collaboration with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center to sponsor several Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies evaluating NBTXR3 across tumor types and therapeutic combinations. In 2023  Nanobiotix announced a license agreement for the global co-development and commercialization of NBTXR3 with Janssen Pharmaceutica NV.About NANOBIOTIXNanobiotix is a late-stage clinical biotechnology company pioneering disruptive  physics-based therapeutic approaches to revolutionize treatment outcomes for millions of patients; supported by people committed to making a difference for humanity.

""In Study 1100  NBTXR3's unique mechanism of action could enable a broader population of patients to potentially benefit from therapy  and we look forward to continuing to develop radiotherapy-activated NBTXR3 followed by anti-PD-1 for the treatment of recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer."" Investigators concluded that promising early signals of efficacy were observed in Study 1100 patients with naïve or resistant 2L+ R/M-HNSCC who received RT-activated NBTXR3 followed by anti-PD-1. Disease control was observed in both naïve and resistant R/M-HNSCC patients  highlighting the potential for NBTXR3 in this population. Overall  these results warrant further exploration in randomized trials for both naïve and resistant R/M-HNSCC patients. ""These new data from Study 1100 continue to provide encouraging signals that radiotherapy-activated NBTXR3 followed by anti-PD-1 could potentially improve response rates and reverse resistance to anti-PD-1 in patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer "" said Study 1100 Coordinating Investigator Colette Shen  MD  PhD. ""The safety  feasibility  and early signals of efficacy we have observed to date support further evaluation in randomized clinical trials."" Nanobiotix expects to provide first data from cohort 3 of the Study 1100 dose expansion part (advanced cancers other than R/M-HNSCC with lung  liver  or soft tissue metastases) in 2025.

Its proof-of-concept was achieved in soft tissue sarcomas for which the product received a European CE mark in 2019. The product candidate's physical mechanism of action (MoA) is designed to induce significant tumor cell death in the injected tumor when activated by radiotherapy  subsequently triggering adaptive immune response and long-termanti-cancer memory. Given the physical MoA  Nanobiotix believes that NBTXR3 could be scalable across any solid tumor that can be treated with radiotherapy and across any therapeutic combination  particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors. Radiotherapy-activated NBTXR3 is being evaluated across multiple solid tumor indications as a single agent or in combination with anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors  including in NANORAY-312-a global  randomized Phase 3 study in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell cancers. In February 2020  the United States Food and Drug Administration granted regulatory Fast Track designation for the investigation of NBTXR3 activated by radiation therapy  with or without cetuximab  for the treatment of patients with locally advanced HNSCC who are not eligible for platinum-basedchemotherapy-the same population being evaluated in the Phase 3 study. Given the Company's focus areas  and balanced against the scalable potential of NBTXR3  Nanobiotix has engaged in a collaboration strategy to expand development of the product candidate in parallel with its priority development pathways. Pursuant to this strategy  in 2019 Nanobiotix entered into a broad  comprehensive clinical research collaboration with The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center to sponsor several Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies evaluating NBTXR3 across tumor types and therapeutic combinations. In 2023  Nanobiotix announced a license agreement for the global co- development and commercialization of NBTXR3 with Janssen Pharmaceutica NV.

For the first time in the competition’s history  real fans were part of the official Trophy lift. Thousands of supporters were immortalised in the celebration by being included in individual pieces of biodegradable confetti  cascading from the sky  symbolising Heineken®'s commitment to championing fan inclusion.This season  Heineken® has been refreshing what it means to be a ‘real hardcore fan’ by flipping stereotypes and celebrating the diverse tapestry of football supporters worldwide. The ‘Hardcore Celebration’ at the UEFA Champions League Final in London marked the pinnacle moment of a season of honouring those that go above and beyond to support the beautiful game.Fans from around the world took the chance to be part of this ‘Hardcore Celebration’ when the teams in the final had been decided by submitting a selfie to Heineken®’s campaign microsite. One lucky supporter that submitted an image was selected to attend the UEFA Champions League Final with a friend.After the images of these passionate fans’ faces 'brush' against the newly appointed champions at the Trophy lift  and the confetti has been cleared away  those who took part will be left with a photo of the celebration featuring their own face  including them in UEFA Champions League history for the rest of time  thanks to Heineken®.Nabil Nasser  Global Head of Heineken® Brand said:“Tonight captures the essence of our campaign  championing fan inclusion and diversity. It's about the unique  sometimes quirky behaviours  the rituals  and the unwavering passion that fans bring to the sport. Our campaign celebrates the sport with its diverse stories and passions of our fans. We are proud to have provided opportunities like the Hardcore Celebration for fans to share their experiences and be part of this unique journey.”Virgil van Dijk  Captain of the Netherlands National Men’s Team and Heineken® campaign Ambassador said:“Celebrating football’s unifying power  the Hardcore Celebration is a testament to every fan who’s cheered  celebrated or shed a tear for their team. Football belongs to everyone  transcending backgrounds  and beliefs. Heineken® celebrates this moment  spotlighting each fan’s face  because we all contribute to football’s heart and soul.”Heineken® has embodied this ‘real hardcore fans’ message through a global TV advert and digital content that shares the authentic stories of our real fans: nuns serenading their beloved team every Sunday and the fans who patiently waited until 3AM local time in an airport just to secure an autograph.To further this fan inclusivity message  Heineken® launched a competition at the beginning of the knock-out stages  giving UEFA Champions League Final tickets away to fans that shared their hardcore fan story. Heineken® also created the Real Hardcore Fan Club  featuring true stories from fans from across the globe  to shine a light on the unique passion that unites real football fans across the globe.Heineken® has been celebrating our real hardcore fans through a series of activities this season  reinforcing the idea that football is for everyone; including the LaundroMatch  where Heineken® transformed 24-hour laundromats in Seoul into all-night meeting places  providing South Korea’s most dedicated football fans with an inclusive alternative to watching UEFA Champions League matches alone. In Peru  Heineken® installed a giant screen on the outside of a tower-block looking into an office  so real hardcore fans did not have to miss the semi-final UEFA matches because it was being shown during working hours.At the UEFA Champions League Final Heineken® is showing its dedication to championing real hardcore fans that demonstrate their love for the game in quirky and authentic ways  by highlighting Real Madrid fan  Jorge.Jorge went viral on social media because he was on a lucky phone call when his team scored the winning goal in the semi-final. Heineken® is now giving fans from both teams in the final the chance to have their luck by creating a phone number that is active for the full 90 minutes  so they can Try Jorge’s luck by making the call...Heineken® will continue to challenge stereotypes by putting real hardcore fans at the centre of its football inclusivity campaigns celebrating the modern face of football fandom into next season.To learn more about today’s activities  visit: https://www.heineken.com/global/en/confettiTo learn more about how Heineken® is helping to refresh football perspectives and foster a more positive and inclusive experience for all fans  visit: https://www.heineken.com/realhardcorefansEditorial information:Please find the high-resolution campaign images: HEREFor more information  please contact: HNKNFootball@edelman.comAbout HEINEKEN:HEINEKEN is the world's most international brewer.
