At the AGM  notice of which is set out on page 18 of this Document  the Duration Resolution will be put to shareholders which  if passed  will allow the Directors to formulate proposals to be put to the members of the Company for the proposed orderly winding up of the Group. Furthermore  the Directors have concluded that it is in the best interests of the Company and its Shareholders to cancel the admission of the Ordinary Shares to trading on AIM. Pursuant to Rule 41 of the AIM Rules  the Cancellation is conditional on the approval of not less than 75 per cent. of those votes cast by Shareholders (whether present in person  by corporate representative or by proxy) at the AGM. It should be noted that GGIC IIP Holdings Limited and its affiliates  as beneficial owners of approximately 75.4 per cent. of the Company's voting share capital  is entitled to vote on the Cancellation resolution. The purpose of the Circular is to provide notice of the AGM  seeking Shareholders' approval for the orderly winding up of the Group and Cancellation  to provide information on the background to and reasons for the proposals (including Cancellation)  to explain the consequences of the Cancellation and provide reasons why the Directors unanimously consider the Cancellation to be in the best interests of the Company and its Shareholders as a whole. The Notice of the AGM is set out in Part III of this document. BACKGROUND TO AND REASONS FOR THE CANCELLATION The Company's assets  other than India Hydropower Development Company (""IHDC"")  have been held for sale in the Company Accounts for the past two years. The Company is progressing its strategy for the disposal of the remaining portfolio of assets  as more fully described below  and are proposing an orderly winding up of the Company. In light of this  the Directors have conducted a review of the benefits and drawbacks to the Company and its Shareholders of remaining admitted to trading on AIM and believe that the Cancellation is in the best interests of the Company and the Shareholders as a whole. In reaching this conclusion the Directors have considered the following key factors: the proposed investment objective of the Company is to realise its remaining investments in an orderly fashion. The Board is committed to this objective and will continue to implement this process should the Cancellation become effective; 8conducting transactions without the burden of disclosure will improve the Company's negotiating position;the considerable costs and legal and regulatory requirements associated with maintaining the admission of the Ordinary Shares to trading on AIM are  in the Director's opinion  now disproportionate to the benefits to the Company and are not conducive to maximising distributions to Shareholders;the Company needs to ensure that its existing cash reserves will last as long as possible given the current uncertainty to the exit plans for its three remaining investments and reducing the operating costs by implementing the Cancellation will extend the time over which the current cash reserves can be expected to last and preserving cash should enable the best possible exit prices to be negotiated for the remaining investments as it will avoid the situation where potential purchasers reduce their offer prices in the anticipation that the Company has insufficient cash to allow it time to seek other purchase offers;the continued quotation on AIM is unlikely to provide the Company with significantly wider access to capital; andthe Directors believe that the low levels of turnover in the Ordinary Shares on the AIM market indicate that few Shareholders have wanted to trade their Ordinary Shares whilst they await the results of announced sales of the Company's investments. A summary of the Company's remaining investments and their disposal plans is set out further below. THE COMPANY'S REMAINING INVESTMENTS AND THEIR DISPOSAL PLANS Distribution Logistics Infrastructure Private Limited DLI is a supply chain transportation and container infrastructure company headquartered in Bangalore and Gurgaon with a material presence in central  northern and southern India. DLI provides a broad range of logistics services including rail freight  trucking  handling  customs clearing and bonded warehousing with terminals located in the strategic locations of Nagpur  Bangalore  Palwal (in the National Capital Region) and Chennai. The Group has received preliminary terms for the sale of DLI from a third party. The last published valuation of DLI was £78.9 million as at 30 September 2023. India Hydropower Development Company IHDC develops  owns and operates small hydropower projects  and is 50% owned by the Group. The IHDC portfolio has installed capacity of approximately 74 MW across seven projects - Bhandardara Power House I  Bhandardara Power House II  Darna in Maharashtra; Birsinghpur in Madhya Pradesh; and Sechi  Panwi and Raura in Himachal Pradesh. IHDC has an additional 13 MW of capacity under development and construction. The last published valuation for the Group's interest in IHDC was £17.4 million as at 30 September 2023. Following the proposed Cancellation  the Company intends to commence a sale process. Indian Energy (Mauritius) Limited IEL is an independent power producer that owns and operates wind farms at two sites in the states of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu  with 41.3 MW of installed capacity. In April 2023 the Group entered into a conditional agreement (""SPA"") for the sale of IEL to FA Power Renewables Private Limited (""FA Power""). The total cash consideration for IEL was approximately $4.4 million. On 27 May 2024  IIP terminated the SPA due to breach of contract by FA Power  who had failed to pay the full consideration for IEL. IEL is currently in discussion with other potential buyers. The last published valuation for IEL was $4.3 million as at 30 September 2023. DEBT FACILITIES The Company had net liabilities of £217.4 million as at 30 September 2023. 9",neutral,0.01,0.93,0.06,mixed,0.12,0.26,0.62,True,English,"['Infrastructure India', 'Cancellation Circular', 'IIP', 'other independent financial adviser', 'INFRASTRUCTURE INDIA PLC', 'Annual General Meeting', '55 Athol Street Douglas Isle', 'The Takeover Code', 'ADVISERS Registered Office', 'FIM Capital Limited', 'Man Companies Act', 'Man IM1 1LA', 'CONTENTS Page Directors', 'Part III Notice', 'Financial Services', 'financial, legal', 'Markets Act', 'other agent', 'United Kingdom', 'AIM Duration', 'reasonable care', 'actual results', 'forward-looking statement', 'particular statement', 'future events', 'applicable law', 'public holidays', 'Proposed Financing', 'Expected Timetable', 'Principal Events', 'The Directors', 'other information', 'The Company', 'Ordinary Shares', 'looking statements', 'IMMEDIATE ATTENTION', 'securities laws', 'Company Secretary', 'new information', 'tax advice', 'accompanying Form', 'Man time', 'DOCUMENT', 'doubt', 'action', 'solicitor', 'accountant', 'purchaser', 'transferee', 'bank', 'stockbroker', 'sale', 'transmission', 'holding', 'release', 'publication', 'distribution', 'jurisdictions', 'persons', 'possession', 'restrictions', 'failure', 'violation', 'offer', 'solicitation', 'number', 'cancellation', 'admission', 'names', 'responsibility', 'knowledge', 'belief', 'case', 'accordance', 'facts', 'import', 'entirety', 'letter', 'Chairman', 'recommendation', 'favour', 'Resolutions', 'AGM', '10.00 a', '26 June', 'Proxy', 'use', 'instructions', '24 June', 'Completion', 'posting', 'appointment', 'Shareholders', 'assumptions', 'risks', 'uncertainties', 'expectations', 'assurance', 'date', 'obligation', 'regulation', 'questions', 'return', '9.00 a', 'Monday', 'Friday', 'merits', '5 Definitions', '5.00', '01624']",2024-06-03,2024-06-04,marketscreener.com

42053,Euroclear,Bing API,https://finbold.com/china-buys-up-gold-as-it-dumps-u-s-treasuries/,China buys up Gold as it dumps U.S. treasuries,With a record $53 billion U.S. treasuries dumped in Q1  China looks to diversify investments with an increasing gold reserves.,The U.S. dollar  long considered the undisputed king of global currencies  might face a potential challenger.China’s central bank  the People’s Bank of China (PBOC)  has been quietly but steadily accumulating gold reserves for the past 17 months.This aggressive gold-buying spree has sparked concerns among financial experts that China may be preparing to move away from its dependence on the U.S. dollar and could potentially destabilize its dominance in the global financial system.This gold stockpile could be a ‘war chest’ shielded from U.S. sanctions  especially considering China’s growing assertiveness on the world stage and decreasing holdings of U.S. Treasuries  according to a research letter from investment firm Crescat Capital.‘While the European Central Bank  the Bank of Japan  and other close US allies still maintain substantial holdings of Treasury securities  China  once the primary financier for the U.S.  has unmistakably shifted its focus towards gold as its core holding ’ analysts wrote.China’s increasing gold reserves. Source: Crescat CapitalThe ongoing pressure for China to devalue its currency is precisely why the country urgently needs to continue accumulating gold. In fact  China’s macroeconomic imbalances strengthen the argument for holding gold.China dumps record amount of U.S. treasuriesIn the first quarter of 2024  China sold a record-breaking $53.3 billion U.S. Treasuries and agency bonds. Traditionally a major holder of U.S. debt  China reduced its Treasury holdings by $22 billion during this period  with the rest of the offloaded assets being agency bonds.China’s ongoing ‘de-dollarization’ strategy involves reallocating its U.S. Treasury holdings into other investments. Chinese assets in Belgium’s Euroclear and possibly in Luxembourg’s Clearstream or the UK suggest a strategy of diversification rather than a complete exit from U.S. debt.While China is buying gold  it remains unclear if these purchases are funded by selling U.S. assets.China isn’t the only country losing confidence in U.S. securitiesBut gold isn’t the only story. Central banks worldwide  including India  Russia  Turkey  and China  with a combined population of over 3 billion  are quietly reducing their holdings of U.S. assets like Treasury bonds. This shift reflects anxieties about America’s mounting debt and political volatility. While a recent dollar surge masks this trend  the underlying move toward diversification persists.The future of the dollar’s dominance is unclear. It might erode  but a gradual shift towards other established currencies like the euro or yen seems more likely.However  a sudden decline in the dollar’s value could have severe global repercussions  including higher interest rates in Europe and emerging economies struggling with dollar-denominated debt.Investors should consider diversification tacticsThis potential shift presents both challenges and opportunities. Investors in the West must be aware of the geopolitical landscape  particularly the U.S.-China relationship.Diversification into a basket of currencies could offer some protection. Additionally  some see potential in the Japanese yen  which has become undervalued  or even the British pound  despite its smaller share than the renminbi.While the dollar’s dethronement isn’t imminent  China’s actions and the broader diversification trend are a wake-up call.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law.

Dematerialised shares do not benefit from the double voting right. The method used by VGP to calculate the holding period of two consecutive years is the LIFO (""last in  first out"") method  i.e.: for the same registered shareholder  the shares that the latter has most recently acquired are the first shares that will be deducted from his total amount of registered shares if he/she transfers shares to a third party. Any share converted into a dematerialised share or the ownership of which is transferred loses the double voting right as from its dematerialisation or entry of its transfer in VGP’s share register. It is therefore important that VGP be kept informed of any transfer of registered shares by the transferor and/or the transferee promptly at the time of each transfer in order to enable VGP to keep its register of registered shares and  consequently  the number of registered shares with double voting rights up to date.ABOUT VGPVGP is a pan-European owner  manager and developer of high-quality logistics and semi-industrial real estate. VGP operates a fully integrated business model with capabilities and longstanding expertise across the value chain. Founded in 1998 as a Belgian family-owned real estate developer in the Czech Republic  VGP with a staff of circa 368 FTE’s today owns and is active in 17 European countries directly and through several 50:50 joint ventures.

I look forward to supporting Scott Jeffers and his team of subject matter experts in getting LUMEVOQ manufacturing to the point of consistently producing this drug at the highest standards of quality  thereby enabling us to commercialize this much-needed gene therapy for patients affected by LHON.I am honored and thrilled to be able to work with an executive with Bill's decades of experience in biologics and gene therapy manufacturing  including his highly relevant expertise in AAV-based manufacturing  operational excellence  and CDMO management  said Scott Jeffers  Chief Technology Officer of GenSight Biologics.

Str…,Patient screening and enrollment initiated for the Phase II part of the international randomized Phase I/II trial with an overall sample size of approximately 80 patients.Last patient enrollment for Phase II part expected in Q4 2025.Strasbourg  France  June 3  2024  7:30 a.m. CET – Transgene (Euronext Paris: TNG)  a biotech company that designs and develops virus-based immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer today announces that the first patient has been enrolled in the Phase II part of the randomized Phase I/II clinical trial of the individualized therapeutic cancer vaccine  TG4050  in the adjuvant treatment of head and neck cancer. Patient screening and enrollment are active  with the aim of enrolling 80 patients internationally in the overall Phase I/II trial.TG4050 is based on Transgene’s myvac® viral vector platform and NEC’s cutting-edge AI capabilities for the identification and prediction of the most immunogenic neoantigens for each patient. The therapeutic vaccine  TG4050  is being jointly developed by Transgene and NEC in head and neck cancer.TG4050 advancing to Phase II part based on Phase I data showing immunogenicity and first signs of clinical benefit.The promising TG4050 Phase I data presented at AACR 2024 (see press release distributed on April 9  2024  here ) showed strong immunogenicity  persistent cellular immune response as well as signs of clinical benefit for patients. At the time of the analysis  only patients in the control arm had relapsed  while all patients who received TG4050 were disease-free. Based on these promising data  Transgene and its partner NEC have decided to move forward with an extension of the randomized trial consisting of a Phase II part. This Phase II part will continue investigating single-agent TG4050 in patients with newly diagnosed  locoregionally advanced  HPV-negative  squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) in the adjuvant setting following completion of surgery and chemoradiotherapy.Although some advancements in the treatment of SCCHN have been made  there remains a significant medical need for these patients  including in the adjuvant setting. With the current standard of care  30% to 40% of patients are expected to relapse within 24 months following surgery and adjuvant therapy. Despite completed Phase III trials  immune checkpoint inhibitors have yet to demonstrate significant benefits for these patients.TG4050 is the only individualized neoantigen cancer vaccine currently being developed in a randomized trial in the adjuvant treatment of head and neck cancer.Dr. Maud Brandely  MD  PhD  Chief Medical Officer of Transgene commented  “The inclusion of the first patient in the Phase II part of our Phase I/II trial marks a further milestone for Transgene. In the ongoing trial  TG4050 is targeting patients with head and neck cancer at high-risk of relapse  with the aim of extending disease-free survival. The Phase I data we have generated indicate that TG4050 enables the induction of specific cellular immune responses that persist up to 7 months post treatment initiation  with all treated patients remaining disease-free after a median follow-up of 18.6 months. We are encouraged by these promising clinical outcomes and look forward to generating data from the Phase II part of the trial. Personalized cancer vaccines are an extremely exciting development and  if successful  could also be utilized to treat other forms of cancer to improve and extend the lives of patients.”This international  multicenter  open label  two-arm trial is currently screening patients in France at IUCT-Oncopole (Toulouse) and Institut Curie (Paris). Additional sites in France  Europe and the US will be added in the coming months. Overall  the Phase I/II trial will randomize approximately 80 patients. The inclusion of the last patient in the Phase II part of the study is expected in Q4 2025.TG4050 is designed based on each patient’s tumorTG4050 is an individualized immunotherapy derived from Transgene’s myvac® platform  combining Transgene’s biotechnology known-how and expertise with NEC’s artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities. Cancer vaccines of this type are individually designed to stimulate and educate the patient’s immune system to fight against their own cancer. This viral-based immunotherapy integrates about thirty tumor neoantigen  identified and selected from tumor sequencing to generate the most effective immune response.***ContactsTransgene:Lucie LarguierChief Financial Officer+33 (0)3 88 27 91 04investorrelations@transgene.fr Media:MEDiSTRAVAFrazer Hall/Sylvie Berrebi+ 44 (0)203 928 6900transgene@medistrava.comAbout TG4050TG4050 is an individualized immunotherapy being developed for solid tumors that is based on Transgene’s myvac® technology and powered by NEC’s longstanding artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) expertise. This virus-based therapeutic vaccine encodes neoantigens (patient-specific mutations) identified and selected by NEC’s Neoantigen Prediction System. The prediction system is based on more than two decades of expertise in AI and has been trained on proprietary data allowing it to accurately prioritize and select the most immunogenic sequences. TG4050 is designed to stimulate the immune system of patients in order to induce a T-cell response that is able to recognize and destroy tumor cells based on their own neoantigens. This individualized immunotherapy is developed and produced for each patient.About myvac®myvac® is a viral vector (MVA – Modified Vaccinia Ankara) based  individualized immunotherapy platform that has been developed by Transgene to target solid tumors. myvac®-derived products are designed to stimulate the patient’s immune system to recognize and destroy tumors using their own cancer specific genetic mutations. Transgene has set up an innovative network that combines bioengineering  digital transformation  established vectorization know-how and unique manufacturing capabilities. Transgene has been awarded “Investment for the Future” funding from Bpifrance for the development of its platform myvac®. TG4050 is the first myvac®-derived product being evaluated in clinical trials. Click here to watch a short video on myvac®.About the Phase I/II clinical trialTG4050 is being evaluated in a Phase I/II clinical trial for patients with HPV-negative head and neck cancers ( NCT04183166 ). An individualized treatment is created for each patient after they complete surgery and adjuvant therapy. Half of the participants receive their vaccine immediately after completing adjuvant treatment. The other half are given TG4050 as an additional treatment at the time of recurrence of the disease as an additional treatment to standard of care (SoC). This randomized study is evaluating the treatment benefits of TG4050 in patients who are at high-risk of relapse. In the Phase I/II study  approximately 80 evaluable patients will be included in France  the UK  and in the USA. The principal investigator of the trial is Prof. Christian Ottensmeier  MD  PhD  Consultant Medical Oncologist at the Clatterbridge Cancer Centre and Professor of Immuno-Oncology at the University of Liverpool. In France  the clinical trial is conducted at Institut Curie by Prof. Christophe Le Tourneau  MD  PhD  Head of the Department of Drug Development and Innovation (D3i)  and at the IUCT-Oncopole  Toulouse by Prof. Jean-Pierre Delord  MD  PhD.In the Phase I part of the trial  32 evaluable patients have been included in France  the UK  and the USA. With a median 18.6-month follow-up  all the treated patients are disease free. Almost all treated patients (95%) developed specific cellular immune responses (CD8+ and CD4+) and the immune responses are persistent and induced against multiple targets. The Phase II part is currently enrolling patients. Endpoints of the trial include safety  feasibility  biological activity of the therapeutic vaccine  as well as disease-free survival (survival without recurrence or death for any cause).About TransgeneTransgene (Euronext: TNG) is a biotechnology company focused on designing and developing targeted immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer.

In 2024  the 10-year prevalence is estimated at 1.9 in 100 000 persons in the European Union (EU). Based on the preliminary clinical data generated with UCART22 in heavily pretreated patients who were relapsed or refractory to approved medicinal products  the European Medicines Agency (EMA) considered that the significant benefit of UCART22 has been demonstrated.“Patients with relapsed/refractory ALL have limited  if any  treatment options  especially for those who have failed prior CD19 directed CAR T-cell therapy and allogeneic stem cell transplant ” said Mark Frattini  M.D.  Ph.D.  Chief Medical Officer at Cellectis. “The Orphan Drug Designation for UCART22 marks an important step towards developing allogeneic CAR T products that would be readily available for all patients.”The last clinical data presented by Cellectis at the American Society of Hematology in December 2023 were encouraging and suggested that UCART22-P2 (fully manufactured in-house) is more potent with a preliminary response rate of 67% at Dose Level 2  compared to a 50% response rate at Dose Level 3 with UCART22-P1 (manufactured by an external CDMO). Cellectis expects to provide updates on the progress of BALLI-01 by year-end 2024.The Orphan Drug Designation in the EU is granted by the EC based on a positive opinion issued by the EMA Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products. Medicines intended for the treatment  diagnosis or prevention of seriously debilitating or life-threatening conditions that affect fewer than five in 10 000 people in the EU are eligible for the designation. The Orphan Drug Designation allows companies certain regulatory  financial  and commercial incentives to develop medicines for rare diseases where there are no satisfactory treatment options.Story continues_______________1 (Dong et al.  2020)About CellectisCellectis is a clinical-stage biotechnology company using its pioneering gene-editing platform to develop life-saving cell and gene therapies.
