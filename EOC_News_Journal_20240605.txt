Resolution 11: General Authority to allot shares Resolution 11 is to give authority to the Directors to allot shares. At last year's AGM  the Company gave authority to the Directors to allot shares and other securities up to a specified amount. The Directors propose to seek shareholder approval for this authority to be renewed at this year's AGM. Resolution 11 will  if approved  renew the Directors' authority to allot shares until 15 months from the date of passing of this resolution or  if earlier  the date of the next AGM of the Company. Paragraph a. of this authority is restricted to the allotment of shares having an aggregate nominal value of up to £7 538 533 representing approximately one-third of the Company's issued ordinary share capital as at 6 p.m. on the Latest Practicable Date. In line with guidance issued by the Investment Association  paragraph b. of Resolution 11 will give the Directors the authority to allot shares in the Company and grant rights to subscribe for or convert any security into shares in the Company in connection with a rights issue up to an aggregate nominal value of a further £7 538 533 representing approximately a further one-third of the Company's issued ordinary share capital as at 6 p.m. on the Latest Practicable Date. The Company does not currently hold any shares in treasury. The extent of the authority follows the guidelines issued by institutional investors. There are no present plans to allot shares  other than in respect of employee share schemes. Resolutions 12 and 13: Disapplication of pre-emption rights Resolutions 12 and 13 are to dis-apply the pre-emption rights of shareholders that exist in consequence of Section 561 of the Act which gives all shareholders the right to participate on a pro rata basis in all issues of equity securities for cash  unless they agree that this right should be set aside. Resolution 12: Under Resolution 12 the Directors are seeking authority  until 15 months from the date of passing of this Resolution or  if earlier  the date of the next AGM of the Company: to allot equity securities for cash to shareholders on the register of members of the Company on a date fixed by the Board  in connection with a rights issue  an open offer or other pre-emptive offer to such shareholders on a proportionate basis (as nearly as practicably possible)  and empowering the Directors to deal with fractional entitlements and any practical problems arising in any overseas territory on any such offer made on a pro rata basis; to allot equity securities for cash without first offering them on a pro rata basis to existing shareholders  up to a maximum nominal value of £2 261 560 representing approximately ten per cent. (10%) of the Company's issued ordinary share capital as at 6 p.m. on the Latest Practicable Date for general purposes; and to allot equity securities as a ""follow on"" offer to an allotment of shares made pursuant to a general disapplication of pre-emption rights  to qualifying shareholders (being existing shareholders not allocated shares in the original offer/placement)  but only up to a maximum nominal amount equal to twenty percent (20%) of any allotment made under part (b) above. Resolution 13: Under Resolution 13 the Directors are seeking authority  until 15 months from the date of passing of this Resolution or  if earlier  the date of the next AGM of the Company: 5 Confidentialto allot equity securities for cash without first offering them on a pro rata basis to existing shareholders solely for the purposes of financing a transaction (or refinancing a transaction if within 12 months of such transaction) up to a maximum nominal value of £2 261 560 which represents approximately ten per cent. (10%) of the Company's issued ordinary share capital as at 6 p.m. on the Latest Practicable Date. This is in addition to the 10% referred to in Resolution 12; and to allot equity securities as a ""follow on"" offer to an allotment of shares made pursuant to the disapplication of pre- emption rights made for the purposes of financing (or refinancing) a transaction  to qualifying shareholders (being existing shareholders not allocated shares in the original offer/placement)  but only up to a maximum nominal amount equal to twenty percent (20%) of any allotment made under part (a) above  Notes to Resolutions 12 and 13: A ""follow on"" offer as referred to in Resolutions 12 (c) and 13 (b) is an offer of a kind contemplated by paragraph 3 of Section 2B of the Statement of Principles of Disapplying Pre-emption Rights most recently published by the Pre-Emption Group (the ""Statement of Principles""). Resolutions 12 and 13 are proposed in accordance with the Pre-Emption Group's 2022 Statement of Principles which permit disapplication authorities of up to twenty per cent. (20%) of issued ordinary share capital in total to be sought (together with disapplication for ""follow on"" offers per paragraph 3 of Section 2B of the 2022 Statement of Principles) provided the extra 10% is used only in connection with the financing (or refinancing) of an acquisition or specified capital investment. The Directors confirm that they intend to use the authority sought in Resolution 13(a) only in connection with such an acquisition or specified capital investment which is announced contemporaneously with the issue  or which has taken place in the preceding 12 month period and is disclosed in the announcement of the issue. Resolution 14: Company's authority to purchase its own shares Resolution 14 authorises the Board to make market purchases of up to 22 615 599 Ordinary Shares (representing approximately 10% of the Company's issued Ordinary Shares as at 6 p.m. on the Latest Practicable Date. Shares so purchased may be cancelled or held as treasury shares. The authority will expire at the end of the next AGM of the Company or 15 months from the passing of the resolution  whichever is the earlier. The minimum price that can be paid for an Ordinary Share is 10p  being the nominal value of an Ordinary Share. The maximum price that can be paid is the higher of 5% over the average of the middle market prices for an Ordinary Share derived from the AIM Index of the Daily Official List of the London Stock Exchange for the five business days immediately preceding the day on which the Ordinary Share is contracted to be purchased; and (b) the higher of the price of the last independent trade of an Ordinary Share and the highest current independent bid for an Ordinary Share as derived from the London Stock Exchange Trading System (""SETS""). The Directors intend to exercise this right only when  in light of the market conditions prevailing at the time and taking into account all relevant factors  (for example  the effect on any earnings per share)  they believe that such purchases are in the best interests of the Company and shareholders generally. The overall position of the Company will be taken into account before deciding upon this course of action. The decision as to whether any such shares bought back will be cancelled or held in treasury will be made by the Directors on the same basis at the time of the purchase. The Directors do not have any present intention of exercising the authorities conferred by this resolution  but they consider it desirable that the authorities are in place so that they can more readily take advantage of any possible opportunities. 3 Recommendation The Directors recommend that you vote in favour of the Resolutions  as they intend to do in respect of the shareholdings of Shareholders whom they represent on the Board  which in aggregate amount to 14 978 354 Existing Ordinary Shares representing 6.623 per cent. of the entire issued Existing Ordinary Shares of the Company as at the Latest Practicable Date.

42151,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.cfr.org/event/media-briefing-biden-france-future-ukraine-and-us-europe-relations,Media Briefing: Biden in France  Future of Ukraine  and U.S.-Europe Relations,CFR experts discuss President Joe Biden's first state visit to France  U.S.-Europe relations  and the future of support to Ukraine.,CREBO-REDIKER: So thank you so much for joining us today. We have an excellent group of speakers from the Council on Foreign Relations. The title is: “Biden in France  the Future of Ukraine  and U.S.-Europe Relations.” It’s pretty broad  but we have—we have three CFR fellows that can speak to pretty much any and all of your questions as President Biden heads over to Europe.We have Charlie Kupchan  who is a senior fellow at CFR and also a professor of international affairs at Georgetown School of Foreign Service.We have Matthias Matthijs  who is a senior fellow for Europe at the Council on Foreign Relations. And he is also the Dean Acheson associate professor of international political economy at Johns Hopkins SAIS.And then we have Liana Fix  who is a fellow for Europe at the Council on Foreign Relations. And her expertise is in Germany and European foreign and security policy.So a lot to—a lot to draw upon today. As was mentioned  this is on the record. The run of show  we’ll be speaking about thirty minutes between us. We’re looking for you to come up with some excellent questions in the Q&A. So start thinking of your questions now and  again  use the raised hand function.As a backdrop  there is a lot happening in Europe this and next week. The president heads to Paris from June 5 through 9 for visit to Normandy. He’s going to be giving a speech on democracy. He has a state visit with President Macron on the eighth. And then we have a lot of—a lot of different meetings happening in the next several weeks that will be talking about Ukraine  European-Ukrainian diplomacy. In addition to the visit to France  we have the Berlin reconstruction event  the conference. We have the G-7 coming next week. And then right on the back of the G-7  we have the peace summit in Switzerland. So and then the NATO summit  coming on the back of that.So a lot of—a lot of things going on. And I’d like to start with Charlie  and just hand it to you to talk a little bit about the—about the agenda for Biden  and what do you think President Biden hopes to achieve from this visit?KUPCHAN: Thanks  Heidi. And thanks to all of you for joining this morning.You know  I think Biden leaves for Europe with a kind of a split screen. You know  there’s a—there’s a lot to celebrate. There’s a lot of positive. There’s also a lot to worry about. On the positive side of the ledger  I think we’re coming off of a couple of years of transatlantic cooperation that is extraordinarily impressive. The level of consultation that’s been taking place since before Russia invaded Ukraine and early 2022 is notable. And the U.S. and Europe have effectively moved in lockstep on sanctions  on bolstering NATO’s eastern flank  on supporting Ukraine militarily and economically.And  yeah  there have been a few moments of wobbliness  but I think a very strong transatlantic consensus still exists. And NATO is  in some ways  stronger than it’s ever been since the end of the Cold War. It’s bigger. It’s got a couple of new allies who decided that neutrality no longer worked for them—Finland and Sweden. And I think in some ways you could say that there is even more solidarity and meeting of the minds and there was during much of the Cold War. And that’s in many respects because I think the Cold War  at least during its closing decades  led to a sense of normalcy. There was an existential threat  but it was remote.Now I think there is a near existential threat. Europeans live with a war—a hot war—that is not very far from their borders. There’s no Ostpolitik. There’s no real outreach to Russia. And in some ways  going back to what Bob Kagan said  about twenty years ago  the United States is Mars and Europe is Venus—i.e.  we understand hard power and the Europeans don’t—in some ways the Russian invasion of Ukraine has flipped the script. And the Europeans on sanctions  on tanks  on long-range missiles  on F-16s  on striking on Russian territory  they’ve been pushing Washington. And so it’s been very interesting to watch a Europe that has been waking up geopolitically and is in some ways pushing the United States to do more.Yeah  there’s still a lot of hard work to do on the European side when it comes to defense but they’re spending more. They’re spending it somewhat more wisely. This is a bit of a game changer here and I think that’s because for Germans  for Poles  for the Balts  even for Western Europeans  this is a wakeup call that presents a kind of existential sense of threat.And the allies in Asia are also now part of the game. My understanding is that Asian partners will once again come to the NATO summit and they have been engaged in supporting Ukraine.Let me just touch on two of the sources of uncertainty and anxiety that will in some ways be in the background but front and center in many respects. Two elephants in the room  I guess you could say.One is the war in Ukraine  and it may well be that while Biden is in Normandy or in Paris or at the NATO summit or at the G-7 the Russians will be making gains.Yes  the Ukrainians seem to have stopped the Russians in Kharkiv but there’s still a lot of hard work to do. The Russians are mobilizing. The Ukrainians have fewer troops to mobilize. American aid is arriving but a lot of it won’t get there for another few months. So it’s unclear what will be happening on the battlefield over the course of these key summits.I also think that we’re still in a kind of uncertain phase as to the strategy. Don’t think that there’s much real prospect of Ukraine achieving victory on the battlefield. Yet  there hasn’t been a forthright discussion about a plan B  about a definition of success that focuses more on defending the Ukraine that now has about 81 percent of its territory under Kyiv’s control. We’ll have to wait and see whether that kind of discussion about strategy is forthcoming.Two other issues that I think I would keep an eye on. One is how does Biden calibrate his discussion of D-Day of World War II of the 1940s with the situation in Ukraine. He doesn’t want to oversell Ukraine in the sense that we don’t have troops there. This is not a threat to American security in the same way that Nazi Germany was.And the fact that we’re not fighting a war with Russia is very much part of American strategy and why the United States has been careful about escalation. So I think Biden needs to tread carefully in not pushing too hard on the analogy of the 1940s.And then  finally  there’s the NATO summit. Clearly  there’s going to be a lot of hand wringing about how to move closer to NATO membership for Ukraine without offering membership because we don’t have a consensus on that  and I think it would make sense to focus a lot on the material  the concrete provision of economic and military assistance to Ukraine for the long term.A final comment  Heidi. The other—the second elephant in the room is the internal threat to the West  which in my mind is at least as acute as the external threat. And it’s not just Trump. It is also what’s happening to the political center in France  the political center in Germany  the likely gains of the far right in the upcoming EU elections.Even if Biden were to win Americans—Europeans are asking difficult questions about American reliability  and we did have a seven-month pause in the flow of aid to Ukraine even with an Atlanticist and a multilateralist in the Oval Office  and now we’re in a situation in which the likely next president  the leader in the polls  is a convicted felon and that now is getting  you know  a lot of play in Europe and causing a lot of Europeans to scratch their heads.I think Biden will to some extent address this question of the future of democracy in his speech in France in the next few days but  clearly  beneath the surface of the solidarity that the Atlantic alliance is enjoying everybody—everybody—is going to be worried up about the illiberal populism on both sides of the Atlantic and the outcome of the November election here in the United States.CREBO-REDIKER: Well  that was a fantastic run through of some of the major topics we’re going to dig into in the rest of this call. But I think  you know  it would be helpful to get a French perspective on what President Macron has on his agenda. You know  President Biden talked about this trip as going to visit our oldest ally. He will be making this speech about democracy. We want to see if it’s going to be more than just rhetorical support in any—in any speech or in the state visit. But I think that it would be—I think  given the internal dynamics in France and also the fact that you have in between all of these different events an election—EU elections over the weekend  so  Matthias  can you just talk about what’s—what is Macron’s agenda?MATTHIJS: Yes. Thank you  Heidi. Let me pick up on the EU election point and Charlie’s endpoint of the enemy within.Macron’s very weak right now  both domestically politically as well as the French economy is struggling. So in many ways he wants to use this visit  which comes right ahead of the French European elections which will be held on Sunday  right—so the EU elections will run from Thursday  Friday  Saturday  and Sunday  over four days in twenty-seven EU member states. And I mean  it’s a mixed bag all over Europe. I think the biggest question mark is turnout  where a lot of EU analysts expect that the high turnout from 2019 will be repeated. I’m slightly more skeptical of this. I think it could well just revert back to the mean  which meant  you know  closer to 40 percent rather than 50 percent  which makes these polls very hard to read  right? I mean  there could be quite a bit of surprises. It could also be the case that the far-right surge does not happen  right? I mean  I feel like every five years we talk about this  and then very little at least on the EU level happens. Most of the action when it comes to the far right has actually been at the—at the national level.So what does Macron face right now? He was hoping to correct this current deficit he has in the opinion polls. I mean  some polls gave the far right—Marine Le Pen’s party  Rassemblement National  up to 33 ½  34 percent of the polls  which—his Renaissance down to like 15 ½ (percent). I mean  that’s an enormous—you’re almost talking about twenty-point deficit  almost what the Tories are facing with Labour in the U.K. And he was hoping to turn this around or at least put a dent in this in the last few days by debating Marine Le Pen  who he has bested many  many times. Of course  she very cleverly chickened out  and Macron will now use the D-Day commemoration events with  you know  the statesman Macron to give  you know  a kind of talk on television. And I think he will use his very close relationship—because they do get along very well personally  Biden and Macron—to show him as—you know  and hope that this will bolster him in those polls where he has been struggling  right? He’s faced votes of no confidence that he’s so far batted away  but there could well be one in the fall related to the next budget where the Républicains—the center-right—could not support him this time  as they have in the past  and then he’d have to form yet another government with a new prime minister. And so he really is struggling.Also  I mean  economically  I mean  I grew up in Belgium  where we always had way worse debt situation than France. The projection now is that France is on a path to have a debt-to-GDP ratio of 112 percent by the end of Macron’s term in 2027  and that’s just above where Belgium will be at 111 (percent). (Laughs.) So it really is—it means  you know  austerity will continue  and this is also part of the—which I imagine Liana will talk about—the Franco-German relationship  which the weakness of France is always they have these great ideas for Europe  but they never have the money or the economic half. And so the money always needs to come from Germany  and that’s where this always kind of clashes.So what does Macron want out of this visit? I think he wants to look good on the world stage. He wants to reaffirm a kind of very strong transatlantic relationship—the common values of  you know  freedom  democracy  all those things; the joint fight against  you know—in World War II plays into this. But you know  there’s also other things he wants to discuss with Biden once they’re in Paris  right  and having closed-door conversations. And that’s  of course  what’s leading up towards the G-7 meetings in Apulia in Italy. It includes Russian assets  and the American plan to do a lot more or go a lot further  and give Ukraine a kind of guaranteed fund that would effectively Trump-proof Ukraine’s financial situation for the next year  at least  and well until the end of 2025. They’ll want to talk about how to deal with Chinese electric vehicle overcapacity  right? So I’m expecting the EU to make an announcement on this next week  probably right before the G-7 meetings  where the French have asked the Americans to coordinate this at the G-7 level.And then  yeah  there’s also—and I think Liana can probably talk more about this—there’s also the whole Pacific situation where  you know  let’s not forget this is a state visit that’s a return state visit of the state visit that happened in 2022  that was really to kiss and make up for the AUKUS debacle  which the Biden administration started with  right? So  I mean  the oldest friendship that America had started off on a very bad footing in the summer of 2021. And so there also the French have interests  right? They have territory and they want to be part of that conversation. But I think  for Macron  the main short-term hope is that this somehow avoids any electoral debacle on Sunday in the EU elections  which would weaken his hand in the negotiations to come on a new Commission  and all these sorts of other things.CREBO-REDIKER: So thank you.And then  you know  Liana  I think  you know  I’d be interested to hear what your view of the D-day anniversary is in Berlin  and how the Biden trip is being perceived in Germany. And also  you know  tacking back to what Charlie was talking about in terms of the Europeans leading the way more on the—on the military side in support of Ukraine  talk a little bit about where Germany falls on the—on releasing some of the restrictions on use of weapons. So both the Normandy D-Day anniversary and a little bit more about how Germany has really evolved on its position  vis-à-vis weapons.FIX: Yeah. Thanks so much  Heidi.Well  Germany obviously is an interesting country to watch when it comes to the D-Day and Normandy celebrations. Obviously  it’s not—(laughs)—it’s not one of the victor countries. It’s the country that can’t take part in celebrations. But for Germany  it’s particularly interesting this anniversary  because it is literally ten years after 2014  after the Normandy meeting where Angela Merkel  back at that time  when Vladimir Putin was still invited to those D-Day and Normandy celebrations  played a major role in leading the Western response to Putin’s annexation of Crimea  the beginning of the war in eastern Ukraine.And if we compare these two situations  they’re not only different because back then we didn’t have military support for Ukraine  we had a dialogue negotiations format  the Normandy format  the Minsk format that was taking shape. There was direct contact and negotiations with Putin between  at that time  French President Hollande  Angela Merkel  and Vladimir Putin  and the Ukrainian president  obviously. But it was really at that time the strong German and European leadership role in efforts for Ukraine. And that has really fully flipped ten years later.So what we see ten years later  and Charlie alluded to that  is a strong alliance  but it is also very explicitly a very strong U.S. leadership role. So from an administration perspective  the summitry is going to be a transatlantic lovefest  obviously. But from a European perspective  the question really is  can we take on the leadership that the United States has provided so far? And I will even go as far as saying that the administration was almost too successful in leading efforts for Ukraine  because there was little space that Europeans took over in the leadership efforts.And now that there was a threat of U.S. elections flipping the White House  Europeans really have to catch up on their own leadership role. So how do they—how do they try to do this? And which role does Germany play in that? I mean  obviously  Germany is the second-biggest provider of help  and military  and financial support for Ukraine. Germany has really stepped up when it comes to air defense system. Germany  especially right now  is trying to convince other European countries to get more Patriots to Ukraine. Countries like Spain  which have been much more hesitant to provide Patriots. Some countries  like Poland  are concerned for their own security.Germany is also—has also accepted that that Ukraine will use these Patriots to defend themselves against Russian attacks coming from Russian soil and try to suppress these attacks  even if they’re sort of directly across the Russian border. But what Germany has not delivered so far and it will not change its position on this  even though it has changed its position in the past with U.S. policy changing  is those long-range missiles that Germany has  the so-called Taurus missiles. From a German perspective  those are almost equivalent to the nuclear weapons that Germany does not have; they are the farthest-reaching weapons that Germany has at its disposal  and giving those to Ukraine  from a German perspective  there is a concern that there will not be enough left to protect NATO allies in case of a conflict. So while Germany has come pretty far when it comes to support for Ukraine  this one aspect  the Taurus missile deliveries  will not change  even though the U.S. has changed its policy in support of ATACMS and delivery of ATACMS.But there are also two other issues where Germany plays a major role which we haven’t fully discussed. I think one important aspect is China’s support for Russia’s war in Ukraine. Olaf Scholz has traveled to Beijing; Xi Jinping has come to Paris and Europeans have received a lot of pressure from the administration  and Biden is certain to continue this pressure and to follow up on this  to not only call China out on its increasing support for Russia—it’s really a quantitative and qualitative difference what Russia receives now from China than what they received a year ago—but from a U.S. perspective  they want Europeans to threaten consequences. They want Europeans to tell China  well  if you don’t stop the support we will take economic measures against you; this is a priority issue for the entire Europe-China relationship. And this is not what we’ve seen yet from Europeans. Europeans are very much  at the moment  immersed in discussions about Chinese EVs  about tariffs against China. Scholz has hoped that he can get Xi Jinping to attend the Swiss summit; this was the big deliverable that he hoped he brought from his visit to Beijing. The language was that Beijing and Berlin will work closely together towards a positive assessment of the Swiss summit. Now that Xi Jinping has said he will not come and Zelensky has called out China for trying to convince other countries not to attend too  this deliverable  from Germany’s perspective  really has disappeared. So we will definitely see this kind of pressure from Biden to move Europeans towards a stronger stance of China’s support for Russia’s war.What we’ll also see on the agenda is Biden trying to get support for the NATO deliverable that is shaping up for the NATO summit  from the U.S. perspective  and there the United States has a strong ally in Germany. An invitation to Ukraine is not on the table for the NATO summit. The NATO summit is meant to be a summit that underlines burden sharing  that underlines that Europeans are doing their part  and that underlines to the U.S. public that NATO is valuable. It’s not a summit that is about Ukraine’s membership. It is a summit that is about the U.S. elections and about showing the U.S. electorate why NATO matters and that Europeans are delivering their part. And this obviously will be difficult to swallow for some Europeans who have hoped  especially as Eastern Europeans  to see more progress towards an invitation for Ukraine  some stronger language. It will obviously also raise disappointment with Ukraine that has hoped to see stronger language on membership. There will be other issues that will be important in terms of supporting Ukraine  but we should not expect any movement on the Ukraine membership part on the road to the NATO summit. And this is what Biden will try to convince Europeans of: Please don’t frame this as a lack of success of the NATO summit; please be onboard with me on this  support me on this agenda. And there he has a close ally with Olaf Scholz and the German government.CREBO-REDIKER: Thank you so much. I mean  there’s a lot to work with here and I think  you know  one of the themes is really  you know  a lot of the topics will be how to sort of Trump-proof  if there is a change in U.S. leadership  the funding  both the military reconstruction funding. There’ll be a Berlin reconstruction conference that is scheduled—Liana  maybe you can touch on that—where financial commitments are going to be discussed on postwar reconstruction that have moved more to  like  repairing the energy and heating systems and the current reconstruction needs and coming up with some plausible plans for what are completely uncertain postwar scenarios. And again  China is emerging as a topic here. I think it’s probably going to be a very big topic on the G-7 agenda  as we look to deal with exactly what you alluded to on the increase in dual-use products coming from China to Russia and direct support for the war being prosecuted against Ukraine.But Charlie  can I turn back to you and maybe get your view on what and where do you think that the U.S. has the ability to move in the next two weeks or over the course of the summer on support for Ukraine  given we had this last big congressional funding package that went through? How do you see this playing out from a U.S. perspective over the coming months before the election—here  the election here? (Laughs.)KUPCHAN: I think that one of the issues that will be under discussion and where there will be movement is extending the time horizon for aid to Ukraine  trying to get a glidepath that says to the Russians  the United States and its allies in Europe are staying the course and we have a decade-long plan to give Ukraine what it needs to defend itself. And that  to me  is essential because we don’t know what Putin’s war aims are and the only way to get him to stop is to convince him that in the end of the day staying on the battlefield will not bring him any further successes. As I think I mentioned  I’m not expecting the Ukrainians to be able to make a lot of headway on the battlefield either; I think we’re looking at what will likely be a stalemate. But that kind of stalemate is possible  given the size of Russia’s population and its military industrial complex  only if you give to the Ukrainians a long-term perspective where that aid keeps coming.Can some steps be taken to Trump-proof that aid? Yes. I mean  that’s  I think  one of the reasons that you are seeing NATO try to take over some of what now is spread out across multiple different formats. I think it’s one of the reasons that the aid package that the United States just put through  61 billion (dollars)  is a big one. But I don’t think that ultimately you can Trump-proof the Ukraine situation because if Trump comes into office  who knows what he’s going to do? And I also think that it’s going to be very difficult for Biden  even if he does get reelected  to secure from Congress the kinds of aid packages that he’s been able to secure so far. And I think we saw during that debate the contours of what might be playing out. And it’s important to keep in mind that 212 Republicans voted against it  in the end of the day  that  I think  fifteen Republican senators voted against it. I think it would be a mistake for any of us or for Biden to underestimate the continuing power of an America-first narrative  even if Trump does not win the November election. So  again  you know  yes  we need to get in train a long-term flow of aid to Ukraine.And just let me end with—picking up on one comment that Liana made because I think it’s interesting and important. In some ways  there may have been too much U.S. leadership because if it does come about that the U.S. steps back from Ukraine and Europe needs to fill the gap  that’s not going to be easy  both for material reasons  even though Europe is ramping up its production lines  but also because Germany in particular has really invested heavily in the Atlantic relationship and less in Europe. You know  as someone who worked in the second Obama administration  I had exactly the same worry  that the U.S. relationship with Germany was great  Obama and Merkel got along swimmingly  but to some extent it meant that Germany wasn’t paying enough attention to Europe. And I do think that  you know  Europe—Germany needs to do both  keep the Atlantic bonds strong but also focus on advancing Europe.CREBO-REDIKER: We’ve hit the 11:30 hour  but while I leave our journalists in the audience to come up with some questions for our scholars  I want to ask Matthias to talk a little bit about one specific part of a Trump-proofing agenda. And that is the discussion on immobilized Russian Central Bank sovereign assets. Because that is where the Europeans really do have to take the lion’s share of the of the risk/contribution  because most of the—most of the assets are based in Europe and in Euroclear. But the U.S. is taking a leadership role there. This is one of those—this is one of those topics where you could see some movement happening out—happening out of this G-7. I think the expectations  at least from the U.S. side  are pretty high. And I’d love for you to go into a little bit of detail. What do you see as both the opportunity? And what do you see as some of the challenges from the Europeans?MATTHIJS: Yes. I can definitely do that. Let me quickly just kind of point out how on the U.S.-Europe relationship it’s been interesting how the Europeans have been pushing the Americans to do more on the Ukraine front  right  especially on the—on the battlefield. And we’ve seen this  again  in the last few weeks. While it’s been kind of the opposite on the—on the China—the relationship with China  right? Where Americans want Europe to move more in lockstep with where they’re going  but there is—you know  there are twenty-seven members in the EU. And Germany and Sweden think very differently of electric cars than  let’s say  France or Spain do  right? And so that  I think  has been—has been striking.But with the exception  on your question  Heidi  on the seizure of Russian assets—and  of course  the cynical part of me says  well  the U.S. would push the Europeans on this issue because  you know  they have very little of a financial relationship with Russia. And we’re talking about 5 (billion) to $10 billion worth of Russian seized assets here. And America can do this at very little consequence to  let’s say  the role of the dollar  because the dollar is still the reserve asset of choice. In Europe  it’s a lot more complicated  right? And so we can talk about this from a Belgian point of view  from an EU point of view  and from a euro point of view  right? It’s very clear that the Europeans have moved quite a bit on this already.Like  if you’d have asked me this question  Heidi  the six months ago  I would have said no way. Not going to happen. The Daleep Singh proposal that comes from the White House to basically take the 300-odd billion euros  dollars  in Russian assets  and use this as collateral to basically  you know  take the future generated dividends and interest and package it now into some sort of $50 to $60 billion package  make it available in some sort of vehicle to the Ukrainians  this is gotten—the move on it has been faster  once they stopped talking about the actual principle of those assets and started talking about the future dividends. So this is something the Europeans do want to talk about  but there seems to be a few things going on  right?There’s some double counting going on. And this often happens when the EU comes up with money  right? So they’ve already approved their own proposal where they now have something like 3 ½ billion for this year in interest on Russian assets  with a special tax that they’re going to make available to Ukraine  at least 90 percent of it  and so on. And so this American proposal that Yellen has been pushing  Secretary Yellen  that Biden himself will push at the G-7  will basically use that same money  right  at least for this year  but we’ll take all the money that’s forthcoming in the next few years  and somehow package this in a way. I think there’ll be progress on this in the G-7  right? But there’s—I think as you know better than anyone  Heidi—there’s a lot of details to be worked out  right?How will this be governed? Will the money be directly  or will this go through other international organizations like the World Bank? You know  will the U.S. government have a say over this? Because if you want to Trump-proof it  and Trump can block it in January if he’s president  then also it’s not a very great situation. That said  if you listen to even Belgian officials who were very reluctant  even people at the ECB  they’re leaving the door open now  right? So I don’t expect there to be some grand announcement in Apulia in in a week. But what I do expect is quite some positive words of encouragement that this can be worked out later this fall with a hopeful landing zone sometime probably late October before the U.S. elections.I mean  that  I think  is probably my optimistic scenario that where I think you could see progress happen.CREBO-REDIKER: So I think  I mean  we might be pleasantly surprised. But the statement that came out of the central bank finance ministers’ G-7 was their mentioned—they mentioned this in very broad brush the use of immobilized assets.But the leaders summit will give the opportunity for real political blessing of this to move forward. So I think that would be—I think that would be welcome.I do see some hands raised. Do you want to—can I hand it over to my CFR colleague to call on some of the participants?OPERATOR: (Gives queuing instructions.)We’ll take the first question from George Condon.CREBO-REDIKER: And if you could introduce yourself that would be great.Q: Yeah. Hi. This is George Condon with the National Journal.You know  as long as we’ve had these summits  I mean  going back to the second one in Puerto Rico in ’76  there’s always been a real concern about U.S. elections and that seems particularly true this year  as Charlie suggested  with Trump’s threats on tariffs and NATO.Can you talk a little bit more about how much panic is there at the possible return of Trump and are the other leaders looking for Biden to say or do something to allay their concerns about the election and about tariffs?FIX: I can give it a try to answer that question since we have just—since I’m still in Europe and we have just returned from a trip to some of the capitals.I don’t think there’s a real opportunity for Biden to say anything to—you know  I mean  what he will do  especially in his speech in Normandy  is to underline the transatlantic relations historic so that even with another Trump term those bonds are so deep and they are so long lasting that they will not be damaged.But I don’t think that Europeans still share this belief. I mean  they had this view in 2016 when they hoped that  you know  a Trump term would not be as disruptive as it became in the end.But for this elections they are especially right now in sort of behind doors in meetings thinking about what kind of context do they have in Washington  D.C.  what could certain governments bring into negotiations or talks with Trump at a potential level  which there are some governments in Europe  for example  Poland  that are much more positive about a Trump presidency that does hope they have a certain leverage with Trump more than other European countries have.So there are some preparations ongoing. But what we don’t see from a European perspective is a concerted effort—a joint European effort. So you don’t see capital sort of coming together and figuring out their strategy at the moment.It is very much focused on their respective capitals themselves the way they’re discussing it and they also are afraid of making this too public because of a fear that this can become a self-fulfilling—that this can become a self-fulfilling prophecy.And the downside of this kind of preparation from a European perspective is that if Trump is elected as U.S. president there might not be enough time for Europeans to come together to develop a joint strategy and we might see in the worst case each capital pursuing their own interests instead of pitching in with a joint strategy.And if one can think of a leader who would be interested in leading a joint European strategy it will be  obviously  Macron. But as Charlie said before  since the German-French relationship is—but he has also (mentioned ?) the German-French relationship is not in a good state  and I would say there’s even a kind of leadership rivalry between Berlin and Paris.There’s not much appetite in Berlin to subsume themselves to a French leadership role and so the risk is that Europeans  in the end  will only pursue their national and own interest instead of developing a joint strategy in case Trump returns.But we do  certainly  see some preparations very much limited to the national capitals at the moment.KUPCHAN: I would just add that there really is an enormous level of anxiety about American politics and it’s not—it is Trump in the sense that there’s fear of Trump returning to the Oval Office and what he might do but there is also a perception  accurate  in my sense  that the United States right now is passing through a period of political dysfunction that is systemic and is likely to be with us for some time and that forces allies in Europe as well as in Asia to simply ask questions about their long-term strategies about whether they can or should put all of their marbles in the U.S. basket.There aren’t good answers to that question. But given the hot mess that the United States is in right now politically I think behind closed doors governments have no choice but to have those conversations.MATTHIJS: You know  one quick thing.Liana is absolutely right. If anyone expects the EU to come together if Trump gets elected into some grand EU strategic autonomy view that  you know  is French in vision it won’t happen.The bilaterals are already starting. People—different governments are trying to figure out who they can talk to who’s close to Trump  who has Trump’s ear  and that’s—on Charlie’s point there is  I think  a bit of wishful thinking still  right  that the polls are wrong or whatever it is.But on the same time  I mean  especially in Italy they’ve had Silvio Berlusconi for about twenty-five years in government who had very similar statute  right? I mean  he was a media magnate. He was—he had multiple lawsuits  he had multiple convictions  and he always came back  right.So it’s not true that being a convicted felon stops anyone from claiming a leadership role in a country  and there Liana is absolutely right that the EU is still  it seems to me  hoping for the best and thinking that they can somehow negotiate with Trump and maybe even that he’ll change his mind on many of the things  which  to be fair  he has done before.CREBO-REDIKER: Can we go to the next question  please?OPERATOR: We’ll take our next question from Peter Baker.Q: Hi  guys. Thank you for doing this. Appreciate it.I wonder if we could—Matthijs talked about how Macron and Biden get along personally and that Macron  of course  would like to use Biden’s visit this week with a state dinner and everything to enhance his stature on the international stage.But I wonder if you can talk a little bit more about the U.S.-French part of this because it does feel like there’s a real tension there right now. When you talk to the Americans they speak about France with great exasperation. When you talk to the French they are quite peeved at various moments about leadership from Washington  what they perceive to be problems there.And I’m just kind of curious if you could focus a little bit more on Biden and Macron  especially given that they’re spending so many days together. It’s a remarkably long investment of time by Biden in one capital.I can’t remember and I  frankly  don’t understand why—and maybe you guys have better insight—he’s devoting quite so many days here in Paris for what’s  frankly  a four-hour event at a time when he should be campaigning back home.MATTHIJS: Yeah. Good question  Peter.I mean  it is a return visit  right? I mean  Macron was treated to quite an impressive state visit here and so they wanted to do the return favor.I mean  I think where the main points of tension are still on  like  IRA  you know  like climate change and how they’re addressing it. France would love to do what the Americans are doing on a continent wide scale but  of course  they need German support for this.There’s also more of a backlash in Germany  which have the greens in government  over any sort of green new deal the EU is doing where at least Macron feels that he can still push this agenda even though there’s just as much of a backlash in France on this.I think they’re actually getting closer on China  for example—Biden and Macron—where this is this is not the case  for example  for Scholz and Biden  right. I mean here Macron always goes out of his way whenever the Chinese—he goes to China or the Chinese comes to invite von der Leyen from the EU  to invite Scholz  who never seems to want to show up because he always has his own agenda. But  yeah  I think on AUKUS  I think that the wounds are still somewhat there on the defense front  where the French still somewhat feel excluded. And so I think  you know  Macron wants to mend some of these things  and even make some headway  right? Get some  you know  guarantees of  you know  American investment into France  and vice versa. And that’s usually what these visits also bring about.But I want to let Liana weigh in on this as well  on this specific thing.FIX: Yeah. It’s a good question. I think I would not over interpret it as sort of Biden giving Macron the legitimacy to be the leader of Europe here  right? And to sort of honor him by this long visit. And saying by that  look  I agree with your outlook  you shouldn’t be the leader of Europe. The others should follow your leader on strategic autonomy and so on. Because  in reality  I think if you would ask the Biden administration  their pick would be Scholz. (Laughs.) I mean  they still get along much  much better with Scholz and his government  despite all the hiccups on Leopards and so on  than they do with the—with the French government.So I don’t think that’s the case. But there’s a real concern about European elections coming up. Matthis already said this before. Especially if you want Europe to stay strong and united  the worst case—I mean  it doesn’t really matter if you have  you know  again  Wilders in the Netherlands—of course  it matters too. Matthias would correct me here. But what—obviously  it would be a huge disaster if you have Marine Le Pen in France  even if she tries to make a Meloni. That can seriously—that can seriously undermine efforts for Ukraine  efforts of European leadership here. So I think the one concern is really pushing back and  as Matthias said  strengthening Macron.And then one issue where the administration has sort of coalesced with Europeans and with the French understanding is the support for the European defense industry. So I think for the first time the administration really has come out and said  well  we need European defense industry to be strengthened instead of  you know  just buying U.S. weapons. And from a U.S. perspective  obviously having joint depth or any other mechanisms to strengthen the European defense industry would totally make sense. And I think there  there’s also a closer alignment  in addition to what Matthias said  with Macron than there is with a German perspective on that  which is much more hesitant. So that might be an additional aspect why strengthening Macron’s position is there. But I don’t think it’s a leadership—I don’t think it’s a meeting of the leader of Europe with the leader of the United States  yeah.KUPCHAN: I would just add one thought on the optics. I’m guessing that what we’ll see between now and the election is the Biden White House trying to create an image of Biden  you know  standing astride the world  close relationships with allies  standing on the shores of Normandy  and Trump is brooding at home waiting to be sentenced. Yeah  Biden does need to go to the—to the swing states  but I think putting him out there as a trusted ally on the global stage probably does have electoral benefits.CREBO-REDIKER: Thank you so much. Can we go to the next question  please?OPERATOR: We’ll take the next question from Leah Griffith.Q: Good morning. This is Leah Griffith from the Japanese paper the Asahi Shimbun. Thanks for this call.My question is  how much attention do you think other priority regions  like the Indo-Pacific and Middle East  will draw away from this administration’s transatlantic focus?CREBO-REDIKER: Great question. I mean  there’s a lot going on in the world right now. It will all be on many of the discussion agendas over the next two weeks. But can I start with Charlie  just on what we might—what else around the world we might be—we might be hearing about in the news over the next couple of weeks from Europe?KUPCHAN: Yeah. I mean  I think that the Indo-Pacific will loom large  in part because of the issue that’s already come up. And that is  how do we deal with China and Chinese support for Russia? And I do think that that there is daylight between the United States and its allies when it comes to China  which may emerge during these conversations. And it’s not just on European reactions to Chinese provision of dual use items to Russia. I think they’re—even though the two sides of the Atlantic have over time converged on China  I do think there are substantive differences of opinion when it comes to trading with China and the overall relationship. And they will be topics of discussion across these various summits.I’m guessing that on the Middle East—you know  I don’t think there are fundamental differences of opinion among the Atlantic allies. I think that everybody is squirming and uncomfortable with the loss of life and the lack of provision of humanitarian assistance  but I don’t see there being significant transatlantic disputes. And my best guess is that everybody is simply hoping that the fighting dies down sooner rather than later and that we get to the next phase in the conflict in Gaza  which is much more focused on provision of humanitarian aid  and who’s going to govern Gaza moving forward.CREBO-REDIKER: Does anyone else want to—want to chime in?FIX: I mean  just very quickly on the—on the Indo-Pacific piece  on that I think the administration has done well by really underlining this linkage between European security and the Indo-Pacific  not through the issue of Taiwan primarily—which we all remember Macron’s comments on his flight back to Beijing where he said  well  this is something we will be dragged in. But by sort of telling Europeans that China is directly threatening European security here.And I think this is a realization that Europeans still really have to fully embrace  because so far they still have hoped for a more positive Chinese role in this war. Especially Scholz has been very proud of Xi Jinping’s criticism of Putin’s nuclear threats  of nuclear threats in general. So there’s still—for a long time there was hope that  you know  the role of China  that China can play  will be able to restrain Russia in any way. But the change that we see now in Zelensky’s tone  the fact that Xi Jinping will not attend the Swiss conference  although Scholz took his home as his one deliverable  might actually help to spur Europeans along  and really to make them realize to what extent China’s support for Russia is really threatening European security in very direct ways.CREBO-REDIKER: You also—I mean  one issue that hasn’t come up on our call today is at the G-7 we always—you know  we have the U.K. and Japan joining. And those are conversations where you will see not only economic security but military security as well  wrapping in the Indo-Pacific sanctions  looking at secondary sanctions  and potential for secondary sanctions on Chinese banks that are facilitating the sale of dual use or potentially other not—more directly military support that have been out there in the—rumor-sphere. You know  that is something where we know sanctions don’t really work well unless they are multilateral. And so the question would be  are the members of the G-7 really ready to step up and do something like that  and enforce secondary sanctions? So there will be an economic as well as a military and security component to  I think especially  the G-7.MATTHIJS: Heidi  if I may  I mean  honestly  I think both in Europe and the U.S. they’re going to be incredibly internally focused in the next six months. I mean  in the U.S.  it’s going to be coming up with the first debate in June  the Trump sentencing  the Trump Republican convention in July  and then the Democratic Convention  and another debate  and the elections. And same in Europe. I mean  this—I expect a very difficult road for von der Leyen if  indeed she does emerge again—which I think most of us still expect as the candidate to succeed herself who will be anointed by the EU leaders in the end of June—it’s going to take—I mean  she’s not going to have much of a European holiday as some of the others will  because she’ll have to carefully put together a coalition.And here  I mean  there’s a lot of talk about Meloni and Le Pen tying up. I think there’s a very low chance of that  because Meloni will lose a lot more by doing that than she stood to gain from staying close to von der Leyen. But again  coming up with a new Commission that needs to be vetted by the European Parliament  and a European Parliament that may not be a far-right dominated one but it may be a very fragmented one  right? I mean  you’ll have a lot of far-right members that will complicate things  but they may not necessarily be united. So in that sense  the next six months are going to be very—there’s going to be a lot of navel-gazing in both the EU and in the U.S. rather than focus on the rest of the world.CREBO-REDIKER: Fair point.Do we have any more questions in the queue?OPERATOR: Yes. We will take our next question from Ken—(inaudible).Q: Good morning.A couple of conferences I’ve been to this spring there’s been a lot of discussion of the importance of hypersonic missile technology. And then you look at in April the U.S.  Israel  and its allies knocked down 300 Iranian missiles. Apparently  they didn’t have hypersonic. But the Ukrainians seem to be struggling. New York Times reported this spring that the Ukrainians were struggling with hypersonic missiles that have been launched at some of their infrastructure. Is that a critical edge right now  hypersonic technology? And does Ukraine need more defense against that threat?CREBO-REDIKER: Who would like to tackle that? Charlie?KUPCHAN: I think that hypersonics are difficult to shoot down because they are not like a ballistic missile following a predictable trajectory. And as a consequence  getting an interceptor to focus on a hypersonic is more difficult.I think that the problem that the Ukrainians face  though  is much broader than that  in that they simply lack the numbers of air defense interceptors for their Patriot systems  for their Stingers  for their SAMP/Ts  for the other kinds of air defenses that they have  given the size of the waves that the Russians are sending in. And it looks like the Russians are launching their attacks on Ukraine from differing positions over time to try to circumvent where the Ukrainians are putting their launch sites. And so if you just look at hypersonics  ballistic missiles  drones  other kinds of assets—glide bombs that are being launched from Russian airspace into Ukrainian territory—it’s a very  very difficult strategic task to shoot down those missiles.What happened in Israel was very different  right? They—basically  as far as we know  the Ukrainians—excuse me  the Iranians announced when they were going to launch these. The U.S.  the Israelis  others in the region  right  had their interceptors ready to go. What the Ukrainians face is a much more difficult strategic task  given the size and scope of the munitions that the Russians are sending against them.FIX: And just to add to what Charlie said  the glide bombs that he just mentioned is something that the Ukrainians are really struggling with because Russia is using Soviet-era missiles and equipping those with a glide function that is very difficult to track with the air defense system that Ukraine has. That has been a real challenge in the past for Ukraine. So sometimes it’s sort of not even the most developed technology like hypersonic technology  but taking sort of the older technology  updating it in a way which works on the battlefield  as Russia has done with those glide missiles  which can—which can prove a real challenge.KUPCHAN: And they also have  you know  real tradeoffs. Do you  for example  locate your air defenses around critical infrastructure  around a power plant  because the costs of that being disabled are high? Or do you protect forces on the frontline? Do you protect civilian population centers? They just simply don’t have the numbers to go around.CREBO-REDIKER: Well  I think we’re coming up onto the—onto the witching hour.

Roughly two-thirds are held in the Belgium-based financial services company Euroclear.After months of debate  EU ambassadors agreed on May 8 that the windfall profits from these assets should be used to fund Ukraine's recovery and military needs.Precise details of the proposed $50 billion loan  such as the interest rate and whether it would be provided directly or through an institution like the World Bank  ""remain to be determined "" the FT said.One issue with the idea is that the U.S. would potentially be liable ""should the profits fall short of required repayments "" the FT said.The biggest issue  however  is that EU sanctions against Russia require an extension every six months  unless renewed by unanimous consent.Washington wants to ensure the sanctions are made indefinite ""until the end of the war to ensure the U.S. is not left on the hook for repayments "" the FT said.The FT highlighted that such a change to the EU's sanction regime ""would require the approval of leaders including Hungary's Viktor Orban  who has jealously guarded his regular veto rights over sanctions decisions.""Budapest has repeatedly opposed Ukraine's accession to NATO and the EU  sanctions on Russia  undermined Western aid efforts for Ukraine  and maintained close relations with Moscow throughout the full-scale war.The FT reported in May that Orban was responsible for holding up EU legislation that would fast-track payments funneled from profits in frozen Russian assets to Kyiv.The proposal is being discussed ahead of the Group of Seven (G7) summit in Italy from June 13 to June 15.",negative,0.03,0.23,0.74,negative,0.02,0.24,0.74,True,English,"['$50 billion Ukraine loan', 'FT', 'US', 'EU', 'sanctions', 'end', 'war', 'Belgium-based financial services company', 'regular veto rights', 'Western aid efforts', 'EU discussion paper', 'The U.S.', 'Financial Times', 'Western partners', 'AI assistance', 'independent journalism', '$50 billion loan', 'other allies', 'full-scale invasion', 'military needs', 'Precise details', 'interest rate', 'World Bank', 'One issue', 'biggest issue', 'unanimous consent', 'sanction regime', 'close relations', 'G7) summit', 'Russian assets', 'The FT', 'EU ambassadors', 'EU legislation', 'Viktor Orban', 'sanctions decisions', 'full-scale war', 'windfall profits', 'EU sanctions', 'audio', 'Ukraine', 'fight', 'member', 'condition', 'June', 'leaked', 'start', 'two-thirds', 'Euroclear', 'months', 'debate', 'May', 'recovery', 'institution', 'idea', 'repayments', 'extension', 'Washington', 'hook', 'change', 'approval', 'leaders', 'Hungary', 'Budapest', 'accession', 'NATO', 'Moscow', 'Kyiv', 'proposal', 'Group', 'Italy']",2024-06-05,2024-06-05,kyivindependent.com

The company is currently building Texas Blue Clean Ammonia – its new low carbon ammonia facility due to start production in early 2025 – nearby  and this project with Waga Energy and the City of Beaumont is the latest example of OCI’s commitment towards the City and Golden Triangle region.OCI Global has a strategic focus on decarbonization and this initiative  which will support increased production of green methanol  is further evidence of action towards that goal. OCI Global will install a gas collection system on the City of Beaumont Landfill to recover the landfill gas spontaneously produced by organic waste. This gas will be upgraded into RNG through a WAGABOX® unit installed at the City of Beaumont Landfill  and then injected into the nearby gas infrastructure. The project will create more than 20 jobs during construction  adding to the more than 300 people already employed by OCI in the area  and will generate royalty revenues for the City of Beaumont once in operation.As part of this agreement  OCI Global will own the RNG produced  while Waga Energy will build  own  operate and maintain the WAGABOX® unit through a gas upgrading service contract. The first of its kind in the United States  Waga Energy expects this business model to be replicated to address numerous landfills with the potential to produce RNG.The facility is expected to be commissioned in 2025 and would avoid up to 27 440 tons of CO2eq emissions annually  equivalent to cutting emissions from 2.8 million gallons of gasoline per year based on the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) calculation methodology. As well as reducing carbon dioxide equivalent emissions  obtaining biogas from landfill has the benefit of using methane – which over a 20-year period  has a global warming potential that is 84 times more potent than carbon dioxide – that would otherwise escape into the atmosphere. A key pillar for the energy transition  RNG is a local  renewable energy source that can substitute fossil natural gas.A result of 15 years of development  the WAGABOX® technology revolutionizes landfill gas upgrading through cryogenics. It maximizes the renewable energy production of landfills by offering pipeline-quality RNG  regardless of the landfill gas variations in flow rate and composition  and regardless of the nitrogen concentration. This will be the first RNG facility for OCI Global in Texas  and the first WAGABOX® unit to be built by Waga Energy in the state. Waga Energy operates 23 WAGABOX® units worldwide with 14 more currently under construction.Bashir Lebada  CEO OCI Methanol and HyFuels  said: “We’re excited about this partnership with Waga Energy and the City of Beaumont  which will not only secure sustainably sourced RNG for OCI HyFuels  but also assist the City in abating significant GHG emissions. We’re proud that our first RNG investment is in Beaumont  where we have a 15-year history of investment and employment  and we look forward to partnering with other local landfills to assist in their decarbonization goals and create meaningful value for these communities.”Guénaël Prince  CEO of Waga Energy Inc. (USA)  said: ""We are thrilled to partner with OCI Global  a visionary leader in low carbon solutions  and a pioneer in the use of renewable natural gas for decarbonizing feedstock industries. This project at the City of Beaumont Landfill is innovative not only because of the cutting-edge technology and utilization of cryogenics  but also for the transformative business model we're introducing to OCI Global as a provider of landfill gas upgrading services.”About OCI GlobalOCI is a global leader in nitrogen  methanol and hydrogen  driving forward the decarbonization of the energy-intensive industries that shape  feed and fuel the world. OCI’s production capacity spans four continents and comprises approximately 16.8 million metric tons per year of hydrogen-based products including nitrogen fertilizers  methanol  biofuels  diesel exhaust fluid  melamine  and other products.

The RNG produced is injected directly into the gas distribution networks that supply individuals and businesses  providing a substitute for fossil natural gas. Waga Energy finances  builds and operates its WAGABOX® units under long-term contracts with landfill operators for the supply of raw gas  and generates income by selling the RNG it produces or by offering a purification service.

In 2024  the 10-year prevalence is estimated at 1.9 in 100 000 persons in the European Union (EU). Based on the preliminary clinical data generated with UCART22 in heavily pretreated patients who were relapsed or refractory to approved medicinal products  the European Medicines Agency (EMA) considered that the significant benefit of UCART22 has been demonstrated.“Patients with relapsed/refractory ALL have limited  if any  treatment options  especially for those who have failed prior CD19 directed CAR T-cell therapy and allogeneic stem cell transplant ” said Mark Frattini  M.D.  Ph.D.  Chief Medical Officer at Cellectis. “The Orphan Drug Designation for UCART22 marks an important step towards developing allogeneic CAR T products that would be readily available for all patients.”The last clinical data presented by Cellectis at the American Society of Hematology in December 2023 were encouraging and suggested that UCART22-P2 (fully manufactured in-house) is more potent with a preliminary response rate of 67% at Dose Level 2  compared to a 50% response rate at Dose Level 3 with UCART22-P1 (manufactured by an external CDMO). Cellectis expects to provide updates on the progress of BALLI-01 by year-end 2024.The Orphan Drug Designation in the EU is granted by the EC based on a positive opinion issued by the EMA Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products. Medicines intended for the treatment  diagnosis or prevention of seriously debilitating or life-threatening conditions that affect fewer than five in 10 000 people in the EU are eligible for the designation. The Orphan Drug Designation allows companies certain regulatory  financial  and commercial incentives to develop medicines for rare diseases where there are no satisfactory treatment options._______________1 (Dong et al.  2020)About CellectisCellectis is a clinical-stage biotechnology company using its pioneering gene-editing platform to develop life-saving cell and gene therapies.

Lacutamab was well-tolerated with a safety profile consistent with prior studies.Innate will host a virtual KOL event on Tuesday  June 11  2024 at 4:00PM CEST (10:00AM EDT).MARSEILLE  France--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Regulatory News:Innate Pharma SA (OTC: ) (Euronext Paris: IPH; Nasdaq: IPHA) (Innate or the Company) announced favorable results from the Phase 2 TELLOMAK study with lacutamab in mycosis fungoides (MF). The results were presented at the ASCO 2024 Annual Meeting  in Chicago  Illinois.As of October 13  2023  data cutoff  MF patients (n=107) received a median of 4 prior systemic therapies and had a median follow-up of 11.8 months.The data demonstrate that treatment with lacutamab resulted in meaningful antitumor activity  regardless of the KIR3DL2 baseline expression  and an overall favorable safety profile. The global objective response rate (ORR) was 16.8% (Olsen 2011) and 22.4% (Olsen 2022)  including 2 complete responses (CR) and 16 partial responses (PR). In patients expressing a baseline KIR3DL2 ‰¥ 1%  the ORR was 20.8% (Olsen 2011) and 29.2% (Olsen 2022). Median progression-free survival was 10.2 months (95% CI 6.5  16.8) for all MF patients and 12.0 months (95% CI 5.6  20.0) in the KIR3DL2 ‰¥ 1% group. Time to response was 1.0 month (95% CI 1  5).The anti-tumor activity observed in the Phase 2 TELLOMAK trial confirms that treatment with lacutamab achieves clinically meaningful outcomes for heavily pretreated patients with mycosis fungoides regardless of baseline KIR3DL2 expression level  commented Dr. Sonia Quaratino  Chief Medical Officer of Innate Pharma. These results are very promising  considering the number of prior systemic therapies that the patients had received before  and the lack of available drugs. These data support further development of lacutamab to bring improved treatments to patients with cutaneous T cell lymphomas.Prof. Pierluigi Porcu  Director  Division of Hematologic Malignancies and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation  Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center  Jefferson Health  Philadelphia  and Principal Investigator in the TELLOMAK study  added: Mycosis fungoides patients have few efficacious and safe therapeutic options at advanced stages. It is promising to see lacutamab achieving remarkable efficacy along with excellent tolerability in this heavily pre-treated population.

Rare cutaneous lymphomas of T lymphocytes have a poor prognosis with few efficacious and safe therapeutic options at advanced stages.KIR3DL2 is an inhibitory receptor of the KIR family  expressed by approximately 65% of patients across all CTCL subtypes and expressed by up 90% of patients with certain aggressive CTCL subtypes  in particular  SÃ©zary syndrome. It is expressed by up to 50% of patients with mycosis fungoides and peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL). It has a restricted expression on normal tissues.Lacutamab is granted European Medicines Agency (EMA) PRIME designation and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Fast Track designation for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory SÃ©zary syndrome who have received at least two prior systemic therapies. Lacutamab is granted orphan drug status in the European Union and in the United States for the treatment of CTCL.About TELLOMAKTELLOMAK (NCT03902184) is a global  open-label  multi-cohort Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with SÃ©zary syndrome and mycosis fungoides (MF) in the United States and Europe. Specifically:Cohort 1: lacutamab being evaluated as a single agent in approximately 60 patients with SÃ©zary syndrome who have received at least two prior systemic therapies  including mogamulizumab. The SÃ©zary syndrome cohort of the study could enable the registration of lacutamab in this indication.Cohort 2: lacutamab being evaluated as a single agent in patients with MF that express KIR3DL2  as determined at baseline with a Simon 2-stage design.Cohort 3: lacutamab being evaluated as a single agent in patients with MF that do not express KIR3DL2  as determined at baseline  with a Simon-2 stage design.All comers: lacutamab being evaluated as a single agent in patients with both KIR3DL2 expressing and non-expressing MF to explore the correlation between the level of KIR3DL2 expression and treatment outcomes utilizing a formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) assay under development as a companion diagnostic.The trial is fully enrolled. The primary endpoint of the trial is objective global response rate. Key secondary endpoints are progression-free survival  duration of response  overall survival  quality of life  pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity and adverse events.About Innate PharmaInnate Pharma S.A. is a global  clinical-stage biotechnology company developing immunotherapies for cancer patients.

Lacutamab was well-tolerated with a safety profile consistent with prior studies. Innate will host a virtual KOL event on Tuesday  June 11  2024 at 4:00PM CEST (10:00AM EDT).Regulatory News:Innate Pharma SA (Euronext Paris: IPH; Nasdaq: IPHA) (“Innate” or the “Company”) announced favorable results from the Phase 2 TELLOMAK study with lacutamab in mycosis fungoides (MF). The results were presented at the ASCO 2024 Annual Meeting  in Chicago  Illinois.As of October 13  2023  data cutoff  MF patients (n=107) received a median of 4 prior systemic therapies and had a median follow-up of 11.8 months.The data demonstrate that treatment with lacutamab resulted in meaningful antitumor activity  regardless of the KIR3DL2 baseline expression  and an overall favorable safety profile. The global objective response rate (ORR) was 16.8% (Olsen 2011) and 22.4% (Olsen 2022)  including 2 complete responses (CR) and 16 partial responses (PR). In patients expressing a baseline KIR3DL2 ≥ 1%  the ORR was 20.8% (Olsen 2011) and 29.2% (Olsen 2022). Median progression-free survival was 10.2 months (95% CI 6.5  16.8) for all MF patients and 12.0 months (95% CI 5.6  20.0) in the KIR3DL2 ≥ 1% group. Time to response was 1.0 month (95% CI 1  5).“The anti-tumor activity observed in the Phase 2 TELLOMAK trial confirms that treatment with lacutamab achieves clinically meaningful outcomes for heavily pretreated patients with mycosis fungoides regardless of baseline KIR3DL2 expression level ” commented Dr. Sonia Quaratino  Chief Medical Officer of Innate Pharma. “These results are very promising  considering the number of prior systemic therapies that the patients had received before  and the lack of available drugs. These data support further development of lacutamab to bring improved treatments to patients with cutaneous T cell lymphomas.”Prof. Pierluigi Porcu  Director  Division of Hematologic Malignancies and Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation  Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center  Jefferson Health  Philadelphia  and Principal Investigator in the TELLOMAK study  added: “Mycosis fungoides patients have few efficacious and safe therapeutic options at advanced stages. It is promising to see lacutamab achieving remarkable efficacy along with excellent tolerability in this heavily pre-treated population. We express our gratitude to the investigators  clinical research coordinators  patients and caregivers involved in the TELLOMAK program.”Efficacy in MF patients and according to KIR3DL2 subgroupITT set All MFN=107 KIR3DL2 ≥ 1%N=48 KIR3DL2 <1%N=59 Olsen 2011 Global ORR % (95%CI) 16.8% (10.9  25.0) 20.8% (11.7  34.3) 13.6% (7.0  24.5) Olsen 2022 Global ORR % (95%CI) 22.4% (15.6  31.2) 29.2% (18.2  43.2) 16.9% (9.5  28.5) CR n (%) 2 (1.9) 2 (4.2) 0 (0.0) PR n (%) 16 (15.0) 8 (16.7) 8 (13.6) SD1 n (%) 74 (69.2) 30 (62.5) 44 (74.6) PD n (%) 13 (12.1) 6 (12.5) 7 (11.9) NE n (%) 2 (1.9) 2 (4.2) 0 (0.0) Time to global response (mo) median (range) 1.0 (1-5) 1.0 (1-5) 1.9 (1-4) Skin response (n=107) % (95%CI) 29.0% (21.2;38.2) 33.3% (21.7;47.5) 25.4% (16.1;37.8) PFS (months) median (95%CI) 10.2 (6.5  16.8) 12.0 (5.6  20.0) 8.5 (6.5  17.5)Virtual KOL Event DetailsTuesday  June 11  2024 at 4:00PM CEST (9:00AM EDT)The live webcast will be available at the following link:https://events.q4inc.com/attendee/476217548Participants may also join via telephone using the following registration link:https://registrations.events/direct/Q4I23670789This information can also be found on the Investors section of the Innate Pharma website  www.innate-pharma.com.

Rare cutaneous lymphomas of T lymphocytes have a poor prognosis with few efficacious and safe therapeutic options at advanced stages.KIR3DL2 is an inhibitory receptor of the KIR family  expressed by approximately 65% of patients across all CTCL subtypes and expressed by up 90% of patients with certain aggressive CTCL subtypes  in particular  Sézary syndrome. It is expressed by up to 50% of patients with mycosis fungoides and peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL). It has a restricted expression on normal tissues.Lacutamab is granted European Medicines Agency (EMA) PRIME designation and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Fast Track designation for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory Sézary syndrome who have received at least two prior systemic therapies. Lacutamab is granted orphan drug status in the European Union and in the United States for the treatment of CTCL.About TELLOMAKTELLOMAK (NCT03902184) is a global  open-label  multi-cohort Phase 2 clinical trial in patients with Sézary syndrome and mycosis fungoides (MF) in the United States and Europe. Specifically:Cohort 1: lacutamab being evaluated as a single agent in approximately 60 patients with Sézary syndrome who have received at least two prior systemic therapies  including mogamulizumab. The Sézary syndrome cohort of the study could enable the registration of lacutamab in this indication.Cohort 2: lacutamab being evaluated as a single agent in patients with MF that express KIR3DL2  as determined at baseline with a Simon 2-stage design.Cohort 3: lacutamab being evaluated as a single agent in patients with MF that do not express KIR3DL2  as determined at baseline  with a Simon-2 stage design.All comers: lacutamab being evaluated as a single agent in patients with both KIR3DL2 expressing and non-expressing MF to explore the correlation between the level of KIR3DL2 expression and treatment outcomes utilizing a formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) assay under development as a companion diagnostic.The trial is fully enrolled. The primary endpoint of the trial is objective global response rate. Key secondary endpoints are progression-free survival  duration of response  overall survival  quality of life  pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity and adverse events.About Innate PharmaInnate Pharma S.A. is a global  clinical-stage biotechnology company developing immunotherapies for cancer patients.

CB 1 -SSi have been developed by Aelis Farma based on the discovery of a natural regulatory mechanism of CB 1 hyperactivity made by the team led by Dr. Pier Vincenzo Piazza  the Company’s CEO  when he was the director of the Neurocentre Magendie of INSERM in Bordeaux. By mimicking this natural mechanism  CB 1 -SSi appear to selectively inhibit the disease-related activity of the CB 1 receptor without disrupting its normal physiological activity. CB 1 -SSi have consequently the potential to provide new safe treatments for several brain diseases.Aelis Farma is currently developing two first-in-class clinical-stage drug candidates: AEF0117 for the treatment of cannabis use disorder (CUD)  that has just completed a phase 2b study in the United States with result expected in Q3 2024; and AEF0217 for cognitive disorders  including those of Down Syndrome (Trisomy 21)  currently in a phase 1/2 study in Spain in people with Down syndrome. The Company also has a portfolio of new innovative CB 1 -SSi for the treatment of other disorders associated with a dysregulation of the activity of the CB 1 receptor.Aelis Farma draws on the talents of more than 25 highly qualified employees.For more information  visit www.aelisfarma.com and follow us on LinkedIn and Twitter.ISIN: FR0014007ZB4Ticker: AELISB Compartment of Euronext ParisDisclaimerForward-looking statementsSome information contained in this press release are forward-looking statements  not historical data.

Thales is using eco-design principles  energy efficiency  recycling  and ultimately carbon offsetting to minimize carbon emissions as part of its worldwide low-carbon strategy. DVLA remains on track to meet UK government target of net zero emissions by 2050.The United Kingdom government’s Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) partners with Thales to reduce the carbon footprint of its driving licences as well as tachograph and residence cards. Since 2018  Thales has cut by over one third the CO 2 emissions associated with the 12 million cards it supplies to the DVLA every year  without compromising the outstanding security  durability and value-for-money provided by these products.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240604196678/en/(credit: Shutterstock – Jubemo/Thales)The DVLA is responsible for maintaining accurate records of more than 52 million drivers in Great Britain and more than 46 million vehicles across the UK. It is also recognised as a centre of excellence for sourcing and issuing secure national documents. Since 2012  Thales has supplied the DVLA with polycarbonate driving licences  a range of tachograph cards (for operations such as recording and storing the activity of commercial drivers)  and residence cards for EU citizens to prove their right to live and work in the UK.Key initiatives undertaken by Thales include adoption of eco-design principles throughout its identity card portfolio. For example  the size of the contactless microcontrollers embedded in the UK’s tachograph and residence cards has been halved  resulting in an equivalent reduction in CO 2 microcontroller emissions while maintaining applications and security features unchanged.In addition  Thales’ factories manufacturing the cards are accredited to the ISO 50001 standard  which focuses on energy efficiency. All these factories use 100% renewably electricity  accounting for over 70% of their total energy consumption. These improvements resulted in a reduction of over 80% of manufacturing related emissions (scope 1 and 2) since 2018.For the remaining emissions of DVLA cards and on a yearly basis  Thales invests in high quality carbon offsetting programs with independently recognized carbon compensation organization such as Climate Impact Partners. For the DVLA contract  these include planting forests in the UK  restoring mangroves in Kenya  and distributing clean energy stoves in Bangladesh. In total  Thales has now offset 3 000 tonnes of CO 2 emissions on behalf of the DVLA.“Just like the DVLA  Thales is on the road to net zero and uses industry standard tools to calculate the Life Cycle Assessments of its products. This comprehensive calculator1 assesses the environmental impact of materials  packaging  transportation  document production and distribution  as well as end of life. Together with DVLA we are continually exploring new opportunities to improve the sustainability of the millions of cards supplied by Thales  looking for more responsible materials and solutions. At the same time  we remain focused on the need to maintain the security and integrity of identity credentials and deliver exceptional value for money for governments and public bodies” saidNathalie Gosset  Vice President Identity Document Solutions at Thales1 This approach was developed with Quantis  a leading environmental sustainability consultancy  and is now supported by Solinnen  an expert consultancy specialising in Life Cycle Assessment  following recognised standards which consider the full life cycle of the products assessed and covers associated scope 1  2 and 3.About Thales Thales (Euronext Paris: HO) is a global leader in advanced technologies specialized in three business domains: Defence & Security  Aeronautics & Space  and Cybersecurity & Digital identity. It develops products and solutions that help make the world safer  greener and more inclusive. The Group invests close to €4 billion a year in Research & Development  particularly in key innovation areas such as AI  cybersecurity  quantum technologies  cloud technologies and 6G. Thales has close to 81 000 employees in 68 countries. In 2023  the Group generated sales of €18.4 billion.PLEASE VISITThales GroupDigital Identity & SecurityView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240604196678/en/,neutral,0.01,0.99,0.01,neutral,0.09,0.89,0.02,True,English,"['UK Driving Licence', 'The DVLA', 'Carbon Footprint', 'Residence Cards', 'Thales', 'high quality carbon offsetting programs', 'The United Kingdom government', 'leading environmental sustainability consultancy', 'Vehicle Licencing Agency', 'worldwide low-carbon strategy', 'Vehicle Licensing Agency', 'secure national documents', 'three business domains', 'carbon compensation organization', 'Climate Impact Partners', 'clean energy stoves', 'industry standard tools', 'Life Cycle Assessments', 'key innovation areas', 'net zero emissions', 'manufacturing related emissions', 'identity card portfolio', 'UK government target', 'polycarbonate driving licences', 'full life cycle', 'CO 2 microcontroller emissions', 'outstanding security, durability', 'total energy consumption', 'UK driving licence', 'Identity Document Solutions', 'environmental impact', 'carbon emissions', 'expert consultancy', 'CO 2 emissions', 'carbon footprint', 'energy efficiency', 'full release', 'Key initiatives', 'ISO 50001 standard', 'document production', 'remaining emissions', 'identity credentials', 'Digital identity', 'The Group', 'one third', 'eco-design principles', 'press release', 'accurate records', '52 million drivers', 'Great Britain', '46 million vehicles', 'commercial drivers', 'EU citizens', 'contactless microcontrollers', 'yearly basis', 'comprehensive calculator1', 'new opportunities', 'same time', 'public bodies', 'saidNathalie Gosset', 'Vice President', 'Euronext Paris', 'global leader', 'advanced technologies', 'quantum technologies', 'cloud technologies', 'source version', 'The DVLA', 'residence cards', '12 million cards', 'security features', 'equivalent reduction', 'responsible materials', 'exceptional value', 'associated scope', 'DVLA contract', 'DVLA cards', 'tachograph cards', 'Thales Group', 'Thales’ factories', 'Thales Thales', '5 years', 'recycling', 'track', 'money', 'products', 'multimedia', 'businesswire', 'news', 'credit', 'Shutterstock', 'Jubemo/Thales', 'centre', 'excellence', 'sourcing', 'range', 'operations', 'activity', 'right', 'adoption', 'example', 'size', 'applications', 'addition', 'electricity', 'improvements', 'forests', 'mangroves', 'Kenya', 'Bangladesh', '3,000 tonnes', 'behalf', 'road', 'packaging', 'transportation', 'distribution', 'end', 'millions', 'need', 'integrity', 'governments', 'approach', 'Quantis', 'Solinnen', 'recognised', 'standards', 'Defence', 'Aeronautics', 'Space', 'Cybersecurity', 'Research', 'Development', '6G', '81,000 employees', '68 countries', 'sales', 'PLEASE', '2050']",2024-06-04,2024-06-05,marketscreener.com

This unique project is a groundbreaking tripartite collaboration  with each partner contributing their expertise to advance it - Flexens  a leader in the development of hydrogen projects with a strong regional focus; Lhyfe  a global front-runner in the onshore and offshore production of green and renewable hydrogen for mobility and industry  whose founding ambition is to reoxygenate the oceans through its offshore activities; and the Department of Ecology  Environment  and Plant Sciences (DEEP) at Stockholm University  with expertise in marine ecology monitoring and a focus on both fundamental and applied Baltic Sea research.Caption : illustration of a waveBOxHy stands at the forefront of efforts to address the critical issue of anoxia in the Baltic Sea  a condition characterised by a complete absence of oxygen that threatens marine life and ecosystem health.All around the world  the oceans have been losing oxygen since the 1950s. The number of coastal sites with oxygen concentrations too low to support marine life has risen from 10 in 1960 to over 900 in 2018 . This loss is directly linked to human activity - namely  water pollution and  increasingly  global warming. These changes in oxygen concentrations have a destructive impact on the ocean  its fauna and flora  but they also affect us humans  because this phenomenon has an impact on the millions of jobs associated with coastal waters  and on the protein supply of more than 3 billion people.By adapting existing technologies to oxygenate the sea  the project aims to restore aquatic vitality and explore the potential for sector coupling with green hydrogen production  offering a sustainable model for environmental restoration and economic development.The project's main objective is to contribute to tackling the problem of 'anoxia' (the complete lack of oxygen in the marine environment) in the Baltic Sea by injecting oxygen into the sea via offshore hydrogen production using water electrolysis  an adapted and existing technology.The project began in October 2023  coordinated by Flexens and is supported by the Baltic Sea Action Plan (BSAP) Fund. BOxHy is on a determined path to evaluate suitable coastal locations for conducting a pilot study of reoxygenation of marine ecosystems through the oxygen co-produced during this water electrolysis  setting a precedent for innovative solutions in marine conservation and green energy integration.BOxHy is endorsed under the UN Ocean Decade  Aligns with Sustainable Development Goals for 2030 Ocean ActionThe United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development aims to support efforts to reverse the cycle of decline in ocean health and gather ocean stakeholders worldwide behind a common framework that ensures ocean science can fully support countries to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Individual projects are typically attached to endorsed Decade programmes within the Ocean Decade Implementation Plan. BOxHy project will be connected to the Global Ocean Oxygen Decade (GOOD).""Receiving the UN Ocean Decade endorsement is a monumental achievement for BOxHy. It validates our commitment to sustainable ocean governance and propels us to foster global collaboration and innovation for the ocean's health. The endorsement is an excellent opportunity to highlight the project's significance and alignment with the United Nations' goals for sustainable ocean management and to invite the scientific  institutional and industrial spheres to the speed up research and implement solutions regarding the need to reoxygenate the ocean""  says Consortium coordinator Szilvia Haide  from Flexens.Consortium member Matthieu Guesné  from Lhyfe  adds: ""The ocean deserves all our combined efforts. By creating this Ocean Decade  the United Nations has helped to put the spotlight on this major issue. We are proud that it has endorsed our BOxHy project in this framework. At the same time  we are continuing our work to make offshore hydrogen production a reality by 2026.""Future Outlook - The project sets a benchmark in the global effort to promote ocean health and sustainability through innovative research and collaborationWith the UN Decade endorsement  BOxHy is poised to grow its stakeholder engagement through active discussions within the Ocean Decade Network and collaboration with other Decade partners. Reaching the long-term target of mitigating anoxia on a Baltic-sea-wide scale requires international collaboration amongst the scientific community  energy sector  policymakers  citizens  investors and more. By taking a stepwise approach to implementation and involving stakeholders each step of the way  we can tackle the challenges and find the best solutions together. The Baltic Sea Pilot for Pure Oxygen Injection (BOxIn) will be implemented in the project's next phase.

Whistleblowers are attempting to reopen a case against Standard Chartered with what they claim is newly-uncovered evidence showing that the bank violated US and international sanctions against Iran.The London-listed banking giant  which focuses its operations in Asian markets  said the claims are “fabricated” and underpinned by “false allegations”.

ABEO's Board of Directors met on 4 June 2024 to approve the 2023/24 financial statements. The statutory auditors have conducted their audit and the certification report will be issued once the procedures required for the publication of the 2024 Universal Registration Document will have been completed.€ million 31.03.2023[1] 31.03.2024 Change Revenue 238.3 248.4 +4.2% Current EBITDA[2] 27.8 29.0 +4.6% % revenue 11.6% 11.7% +0.1 pt Recurring operating income 15.6 16.7 +7.5% Operating income 15.0 13.6 -9.3% Net income 6.5 1.2 €-5.3m Net income – Groupe share 6.7 1.7 €-5.0mABEO Group CEO Olivier Estèves commented on the publication of the full-year 2023/24 results : “Despite the significant challenges encountered in the United States  which affected our Sportainment business  operating performance in 2023/24 remained solid. This is the result of our product mix model and the commitment of all our teams worldwide. The change in net income  affected by non-recurring items  was not significant. Moreover  our financial discipline continues to lie at the heart of our strategy  ensuring that our long-term financial balances remain under control  while still providing the flexibility we need to sustain our development.We can look forward to the 2024/25 financial year with momentum and confidence  underpinned by robust business and with a particular focus on the relaunch of the Sportainment activity in North America.Lastly  we will once again be taking part in the world's biggest sporting event  the Olympic and Paralympic Games in Paris 2024. This exceptional opportunity will allow us to demonstrate our expertise as well as the quality of our products and services to match the sporting performances of the world's top athletes. All the ABEO teams are ready to take on this challenge and promote the values of the sporting world through our state-of-the-art equipment.”Continued growth: revenue up 4.6% like-for-likeABEO posted revenue of €248.4m for the 2023/24 financial year  representing organic growth of 4.6% (up 4.2% as reported). This performance was mainly driven by the Sports division  which posted organic growth of 9.3% (up 9.2% as reported)  and by the resilience of the Changing Rooms division. The climbing wall segment within the Sportainment & Climbing division recorded organic growth of 24.0%  offsetting a Sportainment business that remained severely disrupted in the United States (down 45%)  largely due to aggressive Chinese competition.The Fun Spot subsidiary has implemented an action plan to return to profitable growth  which involves refocusing the business on the secondary equipment market (services and bespoke solutions). At the same time  Fun Spot has also redesigned its value chain to adapt its offering to the highly competitive primary equipment market. Excluding Fun Spot  the Group posted organic growth of 7.8%.Operating performance maintained: Recurring EBITDA of €29.0m  representing 11.7% of revenueRecurring EBITDA[3] for 2023/24 was up 4.6% to €29.0m  giving a margin of 11.7% of revenue  stable compared to 2022/23 (11.6%). Excluding Fun Spot  the Group recurring EBITDA represented 12.8% of revenue.Compared to the pre-crisis 2019/20 financial year  the Group recurring EBITDA margin improved by 2.3 percentage points  confirming the sustainable profitability trajectory.This change is attributable to:a 1.2 percentage point increase in the gross margin reflecting the full impact of the pass-through of inflation into sale prices and the optimisation of the supply chain;increasing staff costs in a challenging recruitment market (29.0% of revenue compared to 27.9% in 2022/23);a limited increase in other operating expenses (up 7.4%) to support business growth.The Sports division posted recurring EBITDA of €19.0m  representing 14.0% of the division's revenue  stable compared to the previous year (down 0.1 percentage point)  thanks to a 0.8 percentage point improvement in the gross margin to 59.7% and a limited increase in overheads against a backdrop of growth (division revenue up 9.3% like-for-like over the period).The Sportainment & Climbing division posted recurring EBITDA of €1.4m and a margin of 2.9%  down only 0.4 percentage point from the previous year. Despite the negative impact of Fun Spot  the division remained profitable thanks to a significant increase in the climbing wall segment  for which volumes and profitability have risen sharply to an all-time high. The 1.1 percentage point increase in gross margin attributable to the product mix largely offset the discontinuation of COVID support measures  which amounted to €0.9m last year.Recurring EBITDA for the Changing Rooms division amounted to €8.7m  representing 13.3% of the division's sales  stable compared to the previous year  thus confirming its high level of performance.After depreciation of fixed assets (€-12.3m  including €-6.0m related to IFRS 16)  recurring operating income amounted to €16.7m  up 7.5% and representing 6.7% of revenue (compared to 6.5% in 2022/23).Non-recurring operating income and expenses amounted to a €3.1m net expense (compared to a €0.6m net expense in 2022/23)  partly comprising costs relating to the restructuring of the Fun Spot subsidiary and M&A transactions during the year. Accordingly  operating income amounted to €13.6m for the year  compared to €15.0m a year earlier.Lastly  after taking into account the cost of debt of €4.3m (compared to €3.8m in 2022/23)  a foreign exchange loss of €0.1m and an exceptionally high tax charge of €8.7m (including €2.9m in non-activated tax losses and €2.9m in derecognised deferred taxes)  net income Group share for the period amounted to €1.7m.Financial structure under controlFull-year cash flow from operations (after tax) improved to a €16.1m inflow (compared to a €9.9m inflow in 2022/23)  the result of €25.8m positive cash flow from operations before change in working capital and tax and a €4.9m outflow from a controlled change in working capital (compared to a €12.7m outflow in 2022/23).Cash flow from investing activities amounted to a €13.0m outflow  €6.4m of which was allocated to the acquisition of a stake in VOGO and the completion of the BigAirBag acquisition. As a result  free cash flow was positive at €3.2m for the year.Cash and cash equivalents amounted to €11.0m at 31 March 2024. Net debt stood at €96.4m (€63.0m excluding IFRS 16) and Group shareholders' equity amounted to€109.7m (€111.1m excluding IFRS 16). Accordingly  excluding IFRS 16  gearing[4] (0.58) and the leverage ratio[5] (2.8) were both under control.Proposed dividend of €0.20 per share for the 2023/24 financial yearAt the Annual Shareholders' Meeting scheduled on 16 July 2024  the Board of Directors will propose that a dividend of €0.20 per share be distributed in respect of the 2023/24 financial year.Trends and outlookBusiness activity at 31 March 2024 remained buoyant  with a 12-month order intake[6] of €248.3m  up 4.6% compared to the previous year (up 4.1% as reported). ABEO is therefore confident in maintaining its commercial momentum over the 2024/25 financial year  bolstered in terms of visibility by its participation in the Paris 2024 Olympic Games  at which it will be represented through three of its brands: Gymnova (Gymnastics)  EP (Climbing) and Schelde Sports (Basketball).The Group is also forecasting an improvement in its operating performance  driven by the expected positive impact of the repositioning of Fun Spot and the continued momentum of its business activities.Paris 2024  52 days to goWith 52 days to go until the Opening Ceremony of the Paris 2024 Olympic Games  and as the city prepares to welcome more than 10 000 athletes  ABEO's teams are busy installing all the equipment for the Gymnastics (Bercy Arena and Porte de la Chapelle Arena)  Climbing (Le Bourget) and Basketball events (Concorde Urban Park for the 3x3 basketball competitions  Bercy Arena and Pierre Mauroy stadium for the 5x5 basketball).The Olympic Games are one of the most effective marketing platforms  reaching billions of people around the world  and remain an unrivalled global sporting  economic and cultural event.ABEO is fully committed to ensuring the success of the Games and keeping the Olympic spirit alive.Upcoming events16 July 2024 - Annual Shareholders' Meeting (Rioz)18 July 2024 Q1 2024/25 revenue (after close of trading)Find more atwww.abeo-bourse.comABOUT ABEO ABEO is a major player in the sports and leisure market.

If approved  it will become the first chikungunya vaccine available in Europe to address this unmet medical need. In accordance with the International Reliance Procedure (IRP)  Valneva is also preparing a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for submission to the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).The CHMP opinion follows the November 2023 approval of IXCHIQ® by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)[1]. Two additional marketing authorization applications are currently under review by Health Canada and the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency (ANVISA) with potential approvals in 2024.Juan Carlos Jaramillo  M.D.  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  commented  “This positive CHMP opinion marks a crucial milestone toward introducing a preventative solution against chikungunya in the EU. In recent years  climate change has caused the Aedes mosquito  a known carrier of chikungunya and dengue viruses  to spread to areas in Europe that were previously unaffected. It is critical to provide a vaccine solution not only to European travelers going to endemic chikungunya areas  such as South America or Africa  but also to the local European populations experiencing invasive mosquito attacks. The broader we can make this vaccine accessible  the better we will mitigate the burden of this debilitating illness  and we would like to thank our partner  CEPI  for supporting us in this endeavor.”Dr. Richard Hatchett  Chief Executive Officer of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI)  commented  “Over one billion people live in areas where Chikungunya is endemic  and recent large outbreaks underline the urgent need for safe and effective vaccines against this debilitating disease. Valneva’s single-dose vaccine is well-suited for use in outbreak response and in low-resource settings  and CEPI’s partnership with Valneva and Instituto Butantan – supported by the EU – will help to make this vaccine accessible to the people most affected by the virus in low- and middle-income countries. Today’s positive opinion from the EMA is an important step towards making the vaccine more widely available.”The positive CHMP opinion is supported by data from the pivotal Phase 3 study which were published in The Lancet  the world’s leading peer-reviewed medical journal  and showed a 98.9% seroresponse rate at 28 days with a single vaccination. This robust immune response was sustained for 24 months by 97% of participants and was equally durable in younger and older adults[2]. Earlier this month  Valneva reported further positive pivotal data in adolescents six months after a single vaccination  which are intended to support filing for potential label extension for use in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years[3]. The data are also expected to support licensure of IXCHIQ® in Brazil  which would be the first potential approval for use in an endemic population.About ChikungunyaChikungunya is a mosquito-borne viral disease caused by the chikungunya virus (CHIKV)  a Togaviridae virus  transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes. Infection leads to symptomatic disease in up to 97% of humans after four to seven days following the mosquito bite[4]. While mortality with CHIKV is low  morbidity is high  and the global market for vaccines against chikungunya is estimated to exceed $500 million annually by 2032[5]. Clinical symptoms include acute onset of fever  debilitating joint and muscle pain  headache  nausea  rash and chronic arthralgia. The Chikungunya virus often causes sudden large outbreaks with high attack rates  affecting one-third to three-quarters of the population in areas where the virus is circulating. The high-risk areas of infection for travelers are places where chikungunya virus-carrying mosquitos are endemic  including the Americas  parts of Africa  and Southeast Asia  and the virus has spread to more than 110 countries[6]. Between 2013 and 2023  more than 3.7 million cases were reported in the Americas[7] and the economic impact is considered to be significant. The medical and economic burden is expected to grow as the CHIKV primary mosquito vectors continue to spread geographically. Before IXCHIQ®  there were no preventive vaccines or effective treatments available and  as such  chikungunya is considered to be a major public health threat.To make the vaccine more accessible to Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMIC)  Valneva and Instituto Butantan in Brazil signed an agreement in January 2021 for the development  manufacturing and marketing of IXCHIQ®[8]. The collaboration falls within the framework of the agreement signed between CEPI and Valneva in July 2019[9]  which provides funding of up to $24.6 million with support from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 program. Regulatory review by the Brazilian authority ANVISA is ongoing.About IXCHIQ®In the U.S.  IXCHIQ® is a live-attenuated vaccine indicated for the prevention of disease caused by chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in individuals 18 years of age and older who are at increased risk of exposure to CHIKV. As for all products approved under FDA’s accelerated approval pathway  continued approval for this indication is contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory studies.Please click here for full U.S. Prescribing Information for IXCHIQ®.About Valneva SEWe are a specialty vaccine company that develops  manufactures  and commercializes prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases addressing unmet medical needs.
