Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law.

The two cohorts were matched for Ascites-Q  age  sex and enrolment MELD-NA  which is a scoring system for assessing the severity of chronic liver disease. These data will be presented as an oral poster presentation on Friday 7th June 2024 at 09.30am CEST at the EASL Congress 2024  Europe’s largest event in this domain  taking place in Milan  Italy.Dr. Bajaj  Professor of Medicine at Virginia Commonwealth University and Richmond VA Medical Center commented: “A real-world  propensity-matched North American cohort of patients which was matched to the POSEIDON study showed significantly improved quality of life with the alfapump. This could help this unmet need in patients with cirrhosis and recurrent or refractory ascites.”Dr. Gijs Klarenbeek  MD  Chief Medical Officer at Sequana Medical  added: “This important study adds to the existing evidence from controlled studies and real world evidence. All data consistently shows the impact of the alfapump on quality of life for this patient population  underserved by current therapeutic options. At Sequana Medical  we are focused on bringing the alfapump to physicians  patients and their caregivers as they deserve modern and impactful care for this condition that has such a detrimental effect on how they live their lives.”Matched cohort analysis of 37 patients from each studyThis was a comparative analysis in which 37 patients from the North Americal pivotal alfapump study (POSEIDON) were matched 1:1 to patients from the NACSELD3 prospective cirrhosis cohort.For the alfapump cohort  Quality of Life (as evaluated by Ascites-Q and SF-36 (Physical Component Score)) improved significantly at six months compared to baseline  but this benefit was not seen in the NACSELD3 cohort.There was no statistically significant difference in mortality  hospitalisations or liver transplants between the two groups; the hospitalisations in the POSEIDON group were mainly observed in the post-implant period.POSEIDON (n=37) NACSELD3 (n=37) P-value Deaths 10.8% (4/37) 10.8% (4/37) Hospitalisations 45.9% (17/37) 35.1 (13/37) 0.48 Liver Transplant 5.4% (2/37) 8.1% (3/37) 1--- END ---For more information  please contact:Sequana MedicalIan Crosbie  CEOE: IR@sequanamedical.comT: +44 7973 42 99 17About alfapump in recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosisRecurrent or refractory ascites is a severe condition characterized by the accumulation of fluid in the abdomen. The current standard treatment involves therapeutic paracentesis  an invasive and burdensome procedure that drains ascites from the abdomen using a large needle over an extended period. If approved by the FDA  the alfapump could become the first active implantable medical device in the US that automatically and continuously removes ascites from the abdomen into the bladder  where it is naturally eliminated through urination.The PMA application submitted to the US FDA was based on the successful execution of Sequana Medical’s pivotal POSEIDON study  a landmark study across 18 centers in the US and Canada with a total of 69 patients implanted with the alfapump. The primary effectiveness endpoints at six months post-implantation in the Pivotal Cohorti exceeded the predefined thresholds with statistical significance  and primary safety endpoint data was in line with expectationsii. Data at 12 months post-implantation continued to show a strong and durable clinical profile  virtually eliminating the need for therapeutic paracentesis and delivering a clinically meaningful improvement in patients’ quality of lifeiii.Data from the patient preference study and a matched cohort analysis of the NACSELD-III registry with the POSEIDON Pivotal Cohort indicated that US patients have a strong preference for the alfapump vs standard paracentesis procedures and that the safety profile of the alfapump is comparable to standard of care.The North American market of recurrent and refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis is forecast to grow on average 9% per year  from approximately 78 000 patients in 2025 reaching 147 000 patients by 2032  primarily driven by the increasing prevalence of NASHiv. The total market opportunity for alfapump is estimated at $2.4 billion in 2025  including approximately $600 million from the Company’s initial priority market targeting patients requiring at least 12 paracenteses per year. To date  over 1 000 alfapump systems have been implanted.About Sequana MedicalSequana Medical NV is a pioneer in treating fluid overload  a serious and frequent clinical complication in patients with liver disease  heart failure and cancer. This causes major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care  they become ineffective  untolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing ""diuretic-resistant"" patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  delivering major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients and reducing costs for healthcare systems.The Company's Premarket Approval (PMA) application for the alfapump was submitted to the US FDA in December 2023 and accepted for substantive review in January 2024  having reported positive primary and secondary endpoint data from the North American pivotal POSEIDON study in recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis. US market approval of the alfapump is anticipated before the end of Q1 2025 with US commercial launch planned for H2 2025.Results of the Company's RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure support DSR's mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE  a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study  have been successfully treated with DSR  resulting in a dramatic improvement in diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements.

The expansion project will support key projects including Nexans’ frame agreement with TenneT signed last year.The construction for the expansion of the plant began in November 2021 and incorporates some of the most advanced cable production technology which will be able to deliver subsea cables up to 525kV for High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) and 420kV for High Voltage Alternating Current (HVAC). The 34 000 square meter expansion more than doubles the capacity of the plant for HVDC extruded cables. It also features a 152.89 meter tall second extrusion tower which will allow the plant to insulate four cables simultaneously in addition to the two existing lines and qualifies as Norway’s tallest building and first skyscraper. The tower will be focused on the production of HVDC cables for offshore wind farms  but can serve both HVDC and HVAC applications. 100 more people have been hired and trained to support the increase in production from the facility and local indirect jobs will also be created to support the supply chain in Europe and globally. This brings the total employment of the plant up to around 1 000 employees on site.The Halden plant also celebrates its 50th anniversary. Having been originally built in 1974 to support the Skagerrak 1 and 2 interconnector projects in cooperation with Statnett  the facility has been involved in projects across the globe. The first extrusion tower was built in 1992 to incorporate the first high voltage XLPE insulated cables into Nexans’ portfolio. The plant also features a state-of-the-art testing facility for high voltage components as well as its own slip to load cables directly onto cable laying vessels such as Nexans’ CLV Aurora  C/S Skagerrak  and Nexans’ newest vessel under construction  the CLV Electra.Christopher Guerin  CEO Nexans  said: “Our investment in Halden significantly increases our production capacity and illustrates Nexans’ commitment to sustainability and the global energy transition. The plant will supply international markets with cables for key offshore wind farms and interconnectors that will bring renewable energy from the areas of high supply to those of high demand.”Pascal Radue  EVP of Nexans’ Generation and Transmission Business Group  said: “The importance of the newly expanded Halden plant cannot be overstated. In a world that is rapidly becoming more electrified  the expansion of cable production will supply a critical need in Europe and globally. We are excited to work with our customers on producing the most technologically advanced cables to date  which will connect renewables to shore and electricity across continents.”About NexansFor over a century  Nexans has played a crucial role in the electrification of the planet and is committed to electrifying the future.

Under this program  the six Member States are authorized by the Union to devote up to EUR 1 billion in public funds for all selected projects and associated partners. The French government and EUROAPI will now be able to begin discussions to prepare the contractual agreement for the granting of public aid within the framework of France 2030.Med4Cure will notably enable to co-fund EUROAPI’s R&D activities up to industrial feasibility studies. EUROAPI will leverage this IPCEI opportunity to further develop three innovative programs and sustainable production processes in Europe and to help meet by 2030 the demand for critical medicines that are currently imported and offer new drug delivery solutions in the following sectors:For macrolide antibiotics used in the treatment of infectious diseases  EUROAPI’s project to reshore production at its Saint-Aubin-lès-Elbeuf site (Seine-Maritime) would enable the Company to expand its portfolio in this global market.For corticosteroids (including methylprednisolone)  which are used for their anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects  EUROAPI intends to develop state-of-the-art processes and technologies at its Vertolaye site (Puy-de-Dôme).For nanoparticles  also in Vertolaye  EUROAPI’s objective is to increase the bioavailability of molecules in the body and to find new therapeutic applications for active pharmaceutical ingredients that already marketed  or to support the development of new drugs thanks to additional formulations.“We are proud to have been selected by the European Commission. It is a true recognition of our mission and excellence in R&D. It will help us carry out innovative projects that are key to long-term European sovereignty and which will contribute to the green transition of the pharmaceutical industry ” said Ludwig de Mot  Chief Executive Officer of EUROAPI. “Our projects are built on strong collaborations with many valuable partners from the academic and start-up environments  allowing this European ecosystem to benefit from a spillover effect that will contribute to Europe’s competitiveness.”These three IPCEI programs are aligned with EUROAPI’s FOCUS-27 plan  which has been announced in February 2024  and will help the Company in building a more sustainable and profitable growth  in particular regarding corticosteroids.For further information on this program  please refer to the European Commission press release.About EUROAPIEUROAPI is focused on reinventing active ingredient solutions to sustainably meet customers’ and patients’ needs around the world.

Proxima has concluded an agreement with Lisea for the use of its new purpose-built maintenance depot  located in Marcheprime  near Bordeaux.PARIS & LONDON & NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Regulatory News:Rachel Picard and Tim Jackson  two highly experienced and respected leaders in the railway world  together with Antin Infrastructure Partners (Paris:ANTIN) today announce the launch of Proxima  France's first independent high-speed train company.Proxima: a response to the huge demand for fast  low-carbon  inter-urban rail travelProxima will strengthen the offer available to high-speed rail travellers in France  providing more than 10 million new seats per year. Travel between key cities in France has increased over the last ten years  reflecting new ways of living. High-speed rail is the answer favored by the French  and train occupancy levels are at all-time highs.Proxima will initially connect four important destinations in the west of France (Bordeaux  Nantes  Rennes  and Angers) with Paris. These routes have demonstrated particularly strong demand in recent years  driven by dynamic economic and business trends  as well as leisure travel and demographic growth.As France's first independent high speed train operator  Proxima aims to reinvent the experience for its different customers groups by listening to their needs  and reflecting the changes in consumer behaviour and changing ways of life. These include trends to teleworking and the erosion of the business/leisure boundary  as well as the demand for better on-board connectivity and relevant services on-board.Antin: a leading financial investorProxima will be fully financed by Antin Infrastructure Partners  an investment company based in Paris and among the world leaders in infrastructure investment with 31 billion euros of assets under management  and supported by a consortium of leading French and international banks.The first phase of Proxima's development will involve an investment of around one billion euros  which will be used for the purchase and maintenance of rolling stock  operational launch costs  and working capital requirements.Alstom and Lisea: industrial partners in the heart of the French regionsFor the fleet and its maintenance  Proxima has chosen the expertise of French manufacturer  Alstom  and has entered into exclusive negotiations for an order of 12 Avelia Horizon trainsets (with the option to acquire additional trainsets in the future). With more capacity  an increased level of customization (both in comfort and design)  and consuming less energy  the Avelia Horizon is Alstom's brand new high speed train model and represents the future of rail. The first train is planned to roll out for dynamic testing in early 2027.Proxima has also reached an agreement with Lisea  concessionaire of the South Europe Atlantic High Speed Line  for the use by Proxima and Alstom of its new maintenance and stabling depot located in Marcheprime  20 kilometers south of Bordeaux.For Rachel Picard  General Director and co-founder of Proxima: Societal  climatic and territorial issues are at the core of our project. We want to help the French public take the train more  by offering them an alternative solution  which is easy  quick  and integrated into their new lifestyles. Thanks to Antin  we will have all the necessary resources to carry out this exciting project for the benefit of travelers.For Tim Jackson  co-founder of Proxima: We are happy to embark on this entrepreneurial adventure with first-rate  French industrial partners  to build a robust and quality offer  and further accelerate the development of green mobility in France.Alain Rauscher  Chairman and CEO of Antin Infrastructures Partners: We are delighted to provide our support to Proxima.

The results indicate a decline in serum neurofilament light chains (NfL)  a biomarker of neuronal death  and confirm the therapeutic potential of the Batten-1drug candidate in juvenile (CLN3) Batten disease. Measurements of the concentration of neurofilament light chains (NfL)  a recognized biomarker of neurodegeneration  after 18 months of treatment confirm the 12-month results presented at the International NCL2023 Congress in September 2023. This biomarker  measured in the serum of patients compliant to protocol  decreased by an average of 33% after 18 months of treatment (as a reminder  32% after 12 months of treatment) compared to pre-treatment level. For Professor Gary Clark  the trial's principal investigator and Chief of Child Neurology at Texas Children's Hospital in Houston ""These results collected after 18 months of treatment are consistent with the absence of marked motor symptom progression reported in these patients. They confirm Batten-1to be of major interest in the treatment of Batten disease (CLN3) and offer unprecedented prospects for treatment of children with this disease as well as for their families and caregivers"". For Theranexus Chairman and CEO  Mathieu Charvériat  ""After announcing positive final efficacy and safety data for Batten-1 at the end of April  we are delighted to confirm these positive results today as indicated by the decrease in the levels of a recognized neurodegeneration biomarker. They confirm the 6-month and 12-month outcomes and demonstrate the strong therapeutic potential of Batten 1 in Batten disease. We are continuing to explore all options to ensure we have the necessary resources to implement our pivotal Phase III trial in Europe and the United States"". Moreover  in collaboration with BBDF and the clinical trial investigators  Theranexus has implemented an Expanded Access Program (EAP) to enable the 6 trial patients to continue receiving the treatment in view of its favorable risk-benefit profile. The trial results will be presented at the next Translational Research Conference for the Management of NCLs  set to be held from 20 to 22 November 2024 in Chicago.About Batten-1 Batten-1 is a novel and exclusive proprietary drug containing the active ingredient miglustat. The mechanism of action of this substance blocks the accumulation of glycosphingolipids and neuroinflammation  thus significantly reducing neuronal death that contributes to a progressive loss of function in patients. For patients over 17 years of age in the Phase I/II trial  the product is administered in solid form. In the Phase III trial  it will be administered in a liquid form better suited to pediatric patients. Phase I/II trial design: this is an open-label trial involving 6 patients over 17 years of age with CLN3 Batten disease  treated with miglustat up to 600 mg/day for an 18-month period. The primary endpoint is patient safety and tolerability  assessed using reports of adverse effects  biological tests and ECG  as well as the pharmacokinetics of miglustat. The secondary endpoints include biomarkers (NfL  glycosphingolipds)  efficacy monitoring: Unified Batten Disease Rating Scale  visual acuity  measurement of brain volumes by MRI and measurement of the thickness of the neuronal layer of the retina by optical coherence tomography scans. Administration of Batten-1 in escalating doses with a maximum of 600 mg/day was well tolerated  with no severe side effects observed causing treatment discontinuation. The most commonly reported adverse events are reversible gastrointestinal effects of often light to moderate severity  thus demonstrating the good tolerability profile of Batten-1 in this population. Further information about the trial is available on https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/showithNCT05174039. About Batten disease Juvenile Batten disease  also known as Spielmeyer-Vogt or CLN3 disease  is a rare  fatal  inherited disorder of the nervous system for which there is no treatment or cure. Juvenile Batten disease belongs to a group of disorders referred to as neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCLs). Over 400 different errors in 13 genes have been attributed to various forms of NCL  which differ from one another primarily by when symptoms first appear. The first symptom in the juvenile form  progressive vision loss  appears between the ages of 4 and 6 and is followed by cognitive disorders  behavioral disorders  and motor disorders. Seizures commonly appear within 2-4 years of the onset of disease. Over time  patients continue to decline mentally and physically. Eventually  those affected become wheelchair-bound  are bedridden  and die prematurely. Juvenile Batten disease is always fatal; usually by the late teens to early 20s. In the United States and Europe  the juvenile form is the most common of the NCLs  which together  affect nearly 2 000 patients1. In pathophysiological terms  interactions between neurons and glial cells play key roles in the emergence and progression of all the NCLs. About Beyond Batten Disease Foundation Beyond Batten Disease Foundation (BBDF) is the world's largest nonprofit organization dedicated to funding research for a treatment and cure for juvenile (CLN3) Batten disease. Since its inception in 2008  over $35 million has been invested in research by leveraging donations  co-funding and strategic partnerships. BBDF is spearheading a unique  cohesive strategy  incorporating independent scientific resources and collaboration with related organizations to drive research in juvenile Batten Disease. Today there is a treatment in sight. BBDF funded research has discovered a drug - Batten-1 - that slows the progression of the disease in Batten models.

The results indicate a decline in serum neurofilament light chains (NfL)  a biomarker of neuronal death  and confirm the therapeutic potential of the Batten-1 drug candidate in juvenile (CLN3) Batten disease.Measurements of the concentration of neurofilament light chains (NfL)  a recognized biomarker of neurodegeneration  after 18 months of treatment confirm the 12-month results presented at the International NCL2023 Congress in September 2023. This biomarker  measured in the serum of patients compliant to protocol  decreased by an average of 33% after 18 months of treatment (as a reminder  32% after 12 months of treatment) compared to pre-treatment level.For Professor Gary Clark  the trial's principal investigator and Chief of Child Neurology at Texas Children's Hospital in Houston “These results collected after 18 months of treatment are consistent with the absence of marked motor symptom progression reported in these patients. They confirm Batten-1 to be of major interest in the treatment of Batten disease (CLN3) and offer unprecedented prospects for treatment of children with this disease as well as for their families and caregivers”.For Theranexus Chairman and CEO  Mathieu Charvériat  “After announcing positive final efficacy and safety data for Batten-1 at the end of April  we are delighted to confirm these positive results today as indicated by the decrease in the levels of a recognized neurodegeneration biomarker. They confirm the 6-month and 12-month outcomes and demonstrate the strong therapeutic potential of Batten 1 in Batten disease. We are continuing to explore all options to ensure we have the necessary resources to implement our pivotal Phase III trial in Europe and the United States”.Moreover  in collaboration with BBDF and the clinical trial investigators  Theranexus has implemented an Expanded Access Program (EAP) to enable the 6 trial patients to continue receiving the treatment in view of its favorable risk-benefit profile.The trial results will be presented at the next Translational Research Conference for the Management of NCLs  set to be held from 20 to 22 November 2024 in Chicago.About Batten-1Batten-1 is a novel and exclusive proprietary drug containing the active ingredient miglustat. The mechanism of action of this substance blocks the accumulation of glycosphingolipids and neuroinflammation  thus significantly reducing neuronal death that contributes to a progressive loss of function in patients. For patients over 17 years of age in the Phase I/II trial  the product is administered in solid form. In the Phase III trial  it will be administered in a liquid form better suited to pediatric patients.Phase I/II trial design: this is an open-label trial involving 6 patients over 17 years of age with CLN3 Batten disease  treated with miglustat up to 600 mg/day for an 18-month period.

Sales as reported were down -22.9%  including -3.7% in currency effect due primarily to trends in the Chinese renminbi and the US dollar.Current Operating Profit was €304.4 million  down -27.8% on an organic basis (+34.9% from 2019-20). Above and beyond a record level of comparison  this figure reflects the significant fall in sales  which was partly offset by meaningful cost-cutting that generated €145 million in savings  of which 45% will be structural. Current Operating Margin declined by -3.0 points on an organic basis to total 25.5%.Sales - in € million (unless otherwise stated) 2023-24 2022-23 Reported change Organic change vs. 2022-23 vs. 2019-20 Sales 1 194.1 1 548.5 -22.9% -19.2% +16.2% Gross margin (%) 71.2% 71.3% -0.1 pts -1.3 pts +4.0 pts Current Operating Profit 304.4 429.6 -29.1% -27.8% +34.9% Current operating margin (%) 25.5% 27.7% -2.3 pts -3.0 pts +3.4 pts Net profit - Group share 184.8 293.8 -37.1% -35.9% +52.7% Net margin (%) 15.5% 19.0% -3.5 pts -3.9 pts +3.6 pts Net profit – Group share excl. non-recurring items 194.8 296.6 -34.3% -33.0% +47.1% Net margin excl. non-recurring items (%) 16.3% 19.2% -2.8 pts -3.3 pts +3.3 pts EPS Group share (€) 3.64 5.79 -37.1% -35.9% +50.0% EPS Group share excl. non-recurring items (€) 3.84 5.85 -34.3% -33.0% +44.4% Net debt /EBITDA ratio 1.68x 0.84x +0.84x +0.84x -0.18xChief Executive Officer Eric Vallat commented:We’ve come through a challenging year in which we moved swiftly to adapt our costs and optimize our structure  while calling for a major effort from our teams. I would like to take this opportunity to thank them  both for stepping up so quickly and for their willingness to take initiatives. In 2023  we also pursued our investment program  continued to innovate  and achieved major progress—in China  where our brands proved resilient and won market share; in Travel Retail  where business is now back above pre-Covid levels; and in e-commerce  where sales rose 20%. We also rolled out “The Sustainable Exception” roadmap. In a persistently uncertain macro-economic environment  these achievements will help us maintain a value-driven strategy rooted in our long-term vision. We are approaching the new year with determination and remain fully focused on recovery in the US market  where we are adopting more efficient sales structures and executing tightly focused initiatives designed to promote a recovery in growth.Current Operating Profit by division In €m (unless otherwise stated) 2023-24 2022-23 Reported change Organic change vs. 2022-23 vs. 2019-20 Cognac 265.7 405.2 -34.4% -33.0% +26.2% As % of sales 34.1% 36.8% -2.7 pts -3.9 pts +5.3 pts Liqueurs & Spirits 56.7 48.1 +18.0% +18.0% +55.4% As % of sales 14.6% 11.5% +3.2 pts +2.7 pts +0.7 pts Subtotal : Group brands 322.4 453.3 -28.9% -27.6% +30.4% As % of sales 27.6% 29.8% -2.2 pts -3.0 pts +2.8 pts Partner brands (0.3) 0.1 - - - Holding company costs (17.7) (23.7) -25.5% -25.3% -12.3% Total 304.4 429.6 -29.1% -27.8% +34.9% As % of sales 25.5% 27.7% -2.3 pts -3.0 pts +3.4 ptsCognacSales at the Cognac division declined -25.1% on an organic basis (+5.8% compared with 2019-20)  including a -29.7% fall in volumes and a Price-Mix gain of +4.6%. This trend reflects both a significant decline in sales in the Americas—where the Group continued destocking while holding prices steady  despite a sluggish environment and fierce promotional pressure—and resilient sales in the APAC1 and EMEA2 regions.Current Operating Profit was down -33.0% on an organic basis to total €265.7 million  representing a -3.9 pt decline in Current Operating Margin to 34.1% (+5.3 pts from 2019-20). This trend reflects the strong fall-off in sales and includes an erosion of -1.8 pts of the gross margin (from a record high basis of comparison) that followed a rise in production costs which was only partly offset by the April 2023 hike in sales prices. At the same time  heavy investments in marketing and communication continued (unchanged as a percentage of sales)  with a more targeted approach on spending. Lastly  the Cognac division managed to mitigate the impact of the sales decline through major cutbacks in its overheads.Liqueurs & SpiritsThe Liqueurs & Spirits division reported sales down -4.6% on an organic basis (+47.4% from 2019-20)  including a -6.4% fall in volumes and a Price-Mix effect of +1.8%. Tougher market conditions in the Americas took a toll  while the whiskey category slowed in China. The EMEA region proved resilient.Current Operating Profit rose +18.0% on an organic basis to total €56.7 million  for a steep +2.7 pt rise in margin on an organic basis to 14.6% (+0.7 pts from 2019-20). This trend reflects both a strong rise in gross margin (+1.2 pts on an organic basis) in the wake of price increases rolled out last April  and tight management of overheads. At the same time  the Group continued to invest heavily in marketing and communications to lay the groundwork for future growth.Partner BrandsSales of Partner Brands were down -6.1% on an organic basis (+2.3% from 2019-20)  undermined by adverse trends in the Benelux and the UK.Current Operating Profit stood at -€0.3 million in 2023-24  compared with €0.1 million in 2022-23.Consolidated resultsCurrent Operating Profit (COP) came to €304.4 million  down -29.1% as reported (-27.8% on an organic basis). This includes a -27.6% organic fall in COP for Group Brands  and a -€6.0 million reduction in the holding company’s expenses that illustrates cost-cutting in a tough economic environment.This figure includes a negative currency effect (-€5.7 million) linked primarily to adverse trends in the Chinese renminbi and the US dollar. The average euro-renminbi conversion rate worsened from 7.14 in 2022-23 to 7.79 in 2023-24  while the average collection rate (linked to the Group’s hedging policy) deteriorated from 7.38 in 2022-23 to 7.59 in 2023-24. The average euro-dollar conversion rate worsened from 1.04 in 2022-23 to 1.08 in 2023-24  and the average collection rate improved from 1.11 in 2022-2023 to 1.10 in 2023-24.Current Operating Margin stood at 25.5%  down -3.0 points on an organic basis  and down -2.3 points as reported. This reflects the combined impact of:a 1.3 pt decline in gross margin on an organic basis to 71.2%  hit by the high basis of comparison (+4.0 points from 2019-20)  rising production costs  and a negative brand-mix effecton an organic basis to 71.2%  hit by the high basis of comparison (+4.0 points from 2019-20)  rising production costs  and a negative brand-mix effect a stabilization of the marketing and communication spend ratio (spending up by 3.5 pts from 2019-20)(spending up by 3.5 pts from 2019-20) a controlled increase of the overhead costs ratio (-1.9 pts on an organic basis) reflecting a 12.0% organic reduction in the cost base (down by 2.9 points from 2019-20)(-1.9 pts on an organic basis) reflecting a 12.0% organic reduction in the cost base (down by 2.9 points from 2019-20) a favorable currency effect: +0.7 ptsOther operating income and expenses totaled -€12.8 million in 2023-24 compared with -€3.1 million in 2022-23  and consisted mainly of the cost of restructuring distribution networks in the United States and Europe.Net financial expense stood at -€38.5 million in 2023-24 (vs -€17.6 million in 2022-23)  amid higher interest rates and renewal of long-term credit lines.Tax charges came to €69.4 million  setting the effective tax rate at 27.4% in 2023-24 (27.1% excluding non-recurring items). This compares with 28.4% in 2022-23 (28.3% excluding non-recurring items) and reflects geographical mix.Net Profit Group share stood at €184.8 million  down -37.1% as reported (+52.7% on an organic basis when compared with 2019-20)  setting net margin at 15.5%  down -3.5 points as reported.EPS Group share totaled €3.64  down -37.1% as reported compared to 2022-23. Excluding non-recurring items  EPS came to €3.84.Net debt stood at €649.7 million  or €113.1 million more than at 31 March 2023  following the strong drop in EBITDA. Even so  Free Cash Flow improved sharply in the second half to total +€13.8 million full year (of which +€112.8 million in the second half). The ratio of net debt/EBITDA was 1.68 on 31 March 2024 compared with 0.84 one year earlier.Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) came to 15.5% on 31 March 2024  down -8.9 points (-8.6 pts on an organic basis). This followed a fall in profitability of Group brands combined with ongoing strategic purchases of eaux-de-vie and investments that weighed on capital employed.At the annual general meeting to be held on 18 July 2024  the Board of Directors will propose the payment of an ordinary dividend of €2.0 per share. Payment will include an option payable in cash or shares for the totality of the dividend paid out. Subject to approval by shareholders  the Group’s majority shareholder ORPAR has informed Rémy Cointreau that it will ask for the 2023-24 dividend to be paid entirely in shares  demonstrating its confidence in the Group’s future growth.“The Sustainable Exception”: supporting responsible growthIn 2019-20  Rémy Cointreau initiated a profound transformation of its business model to adapt to major climate change worldwide. Sustainable development is one of the four pillars supporting this transformation. The Sustainable Exception plan is an ambitious programme built on a clear vision  CSR-driven governance at all levels of the Group  and investments totaling €80 million over 10 years.In 2023-24  Rémy Cointreau continued to roll out this plan and its efforts were rewarded. CDP was one body that recognized progress made by awarding the Group an A rating in the Climate category  an A- in Water  and Leader status in Suppliers. Westland became a certified BCorp during the year  and PHD Malts’ BCorp status was renewed.New Generation TerroirsTo meet the challenges of adapting its terroirs to the hazards of climate change  Rémy Cointreau has continued to deploy its New Generation Terroirs plan. This is designed to:make terroirs more resilient as the climate becomes more erratic  and thus secure a steady supply of essential raw materials over the long termpromote our soils as carbon sinks in the fight against global warmingFor the past 10 years  Rémy Cointreau has worked to commit its entire supply of agricultural raw materials to environmental certification programmes (79% as of March 2024). But in the past 3 years  it has raised the bar further  targeting a conversion to regenerative agriculture and viticulture. Today around 40% of the estates it owns are already on board  and the Group is focused on committing all its suppliers to this approach  aiming to train 100% of its direct farmers and growers in regenerative farming practices by 2030 (6% as of March 2024).Reducing Greenhouse GasesIn 2023-24  the Group’s total carbon footprint  including scopes 1  2 and 3  stood at 167 459 tCO2eq  down -15.0% from the previous year. This was achieved on the back of a decline in volumes produced and all the actions implemented by the Group throughout its value chain.GHG emissions for scopes 1 and 2 (5%) were down by -10.0%  following a decline in volumes distilled and more energy-efficient operations at production sites.(5%) were down by -10.0%  following a decline in volumes distilled and more energy-efficient operations at production sites. GHG emissions for scope 3 (95%) were down by -15.0%: Emissions linked to packaging: -27.0% (79% of products sold without packaging in 2023-24) Emissions linked to transport: -21.0%(95%) were down by -15.0%:Water Stewardship PlanIn 2023  the Group revised its approach to sustainable water management under a Water Stewardship Plan designed to structure and accelerate implementation.This Plan calls for action on three fronts:reducing water withdrawals at production sitesimproving quality and recovery of effluentsregenerating water through high-impact actions  particularly in areas of water stressA total of 210 663 m3 of water were used in 2023-24  down -19.0%.2024-25 objectivesDespite the sharp fall in its 2023-24 results  Rémy Cointreau continues to exceed milestones set for its 10-year strategic plan. 2024-25 will be a year of transition  with highlights including finalization of destocking in the Americas  and 2025-26 will mark a resumption of the trajectory and targets set for 2029-30:high single-digit annual growth in sales on average and on an organic basisa gradual organic improvement in Current Operating Profit marginIn a complex environment with limited visibility in its main markets  Rémy Cointreau anticipates a gradual recovery in sales over the course of 2024-25  with the first half affected by:continued inventory adjustments in the Americas  given the still-negative trend in depletions 3a high basis of comparison in the APAC region (sales up +55% in H1 2023-24 compared with H1 2019-20)region (sales up +55% in H1 2023-24 compared with H1 2019-20) mixed consumption levels in the EMEA region.Against this backdrop  Rémy Cointreau is determined to use tight cost controls and its value-driven strategy to protect its profitability  while continuing to make the investments needed for tomorrow’s growth.In 2024-25  the Group will build on:the resilience of its gross margin thanks to a measured  selective rise in prices amid moderate inflationthanks to a measured  selective rise in prices amid moderate inflation normalization of its marketing & communication/sales ratio  at a level much higher than in 2019-20at a level much higher than in 2019-20 tight control of overheads to offset most of the rise in costs resulting from the reversal of temporary savings achieved in 2023-24.Lastly  Group forecasts of the currency effects call for:a negative impact on sales between -€5 million and -€10 milliona favorable impact on Current Operating Profit of between +€3 million and +€7 million2029-30 objectives confirmedRémy Cointreau reiterates both its financial and extra-financial targets for 2029-30  and its aim to become the global leader in exceptional spirits.The Group targets a gross margin of 72% and a Current Operating Margin of 33% based on 2019-20 consolidated scope and exchange rates.As part of The Sustainable Exception plan  Rémy Cointreau aims to train and engage 100% of its direct partners in agriculture in regenerative agriculture practices  targeting a 50% reduction in carbon emissions per bottle by 2030. This is the first step towards achieving zero net carbon status in 2050—a trajectory compatible with holding global warming to +1.5°C as validated by the Science Based Target Initiative (SBTI). Lastly  the Group is aiming to reduce water withdrawals at its production sites by -20% per liter of alcohol produced by 2030.A webcast for investors and analysts will be held today  starting at 9.00 (CET) with Marie-Amélie de Leusse  Chairwoman; Eric Vallat  CEO; and Luca Marotta  CFO.

Such differences are not material.Rémy Cointreau’s management process is based on the following alternative performance indicators  selected for planning and reporting purposes. The Group’s management considers that these indicators provide users of the financial statements with useful additional information to help them understand the Group’s performance. These alternative performance indicators should be considered as supplementing those included in the consolidated financial statements and the resulting movements.Organic growth in sales and Current Operating ProfitOrganic growth is calculated excluding the impact of exchange rate fluctuations  acquisitions and disposals. This indicator serves to focus on Group performance common to both financial years  which local management is more directly capable of measuring.The impact of exchange rates is calculated by converting sales and Current Operating Profit for the current financial year using average exchange rates (or  for Current Operating Profit  the hedged exchange rate) from the previous financial year.For acquisitions in the current financial year  sales and Current Operating Profit of acquired entities are not included in organic growth calculations. For acquisitions in the previous financial year  sales and Current Operating Profit of acquired entities are included in the previous financial year; however  they are only included in current year organic growth calculations with effect from the anniversary date of the acquisition.For significant disposals  data is post-application of IFRS 5  under which results of entities disposed of are systematically reclassified under “Net earnings from discontinued operations”.Indicators “excluding non-recurring items”The two items set out below constitute key indicators for measuring recurring business performance  since they exclude significant items which  by virtue of their unusual nature  cannot be considered inherent to the Group’s ongoing performance:Current Operating Profit consists of operating profit before other non-recurring operating income and expenses.Net profit attributable to the Group excluding non-recurring items consists of net profit attributable to the Group adjusted to exclude other non-recurring operating income and expenses  associated tax effects  profit from deconsolidated  divested and discontinued operations and the contribution from dividends paid in cash.Gross operating profit (EBITDA)This measure  which is used in particular to calculate certain ratios  equates to Current Operating Profit less amortization and depreciation expenses on intangible assets and property  plant and equipment for the period  expenses arising from stock option plans  and dividends received from associates during the period.Net debtNet financial debt as defined and used by the Group is equal to the sum of long- and short-term financial debt and accrued interest  less cash and cash equivalents.About Rémy CointreauAll around the world  there are clients seeking exceptional experiences; clients for whom a wide range of terroirs means a variety of flavors.

The time is ripe to implement the full restructuring plan as approved by BioSenic's creditors  following the expected homologation decision by the Enterprise Court of Nivelles. The most promising projects will be selected for BioSenic's active development  starting with our Phase 3 trial for the treatment of chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGvHD)  and the company needs strong financial support from our investors in this respect"". said Prof. François Rieger  President and CEO of BioSenic.Clinical and corporate highlights (including post-period events)In January 2023  BioSenic strengthened its scientific team with the appointment of Dr. Carole Nicco  PhD  as Chief Scientific Officer (CSO).In January 2023  BioSenic appointed Yves Sagot as a member of the Board of Directors and Independent Director.In March 2023  BioSenic re-evaluated the results of its Phase 3 trial of its enhanced viscosupplement JTA-004 targeting knee osteoarthritis (OA). The Company indeed announced that it has used the statistical analysis capabilities of Artialis to study the results of the Phase 3 JTA-004 trial in the subset of patients with the most painful and inflammatory form of knee osteoarthritis (OA). This allows BioSenic to distinguish a group of patients  representing about one third of the total patients  who show a pain-relieving effect of JTA-004 not only superior to placebo but also to the active comparator. This new post-hoc analysis changes the therapeutic profile of the molecule and potentially allows for the possibility of stratifying patients for a new  optimized Phase 3 clinical study.In March 2023  BioSenic published new data on the mechanism of action of arsenic trioxide (ATO) to prevent autoimmune diseases in a peer-reviewed paper (Frontiers in Immunology). This new data shows that combination of ATO with copper salts can allow BioSenic to work towards reducing the dosage of ATO in future trials overall and maintain efficacy. This new formulation data has been completed following pre-clinical activities and does not constitute data validated through clinical trial.In April 2023  BioSenic appointed Lieven Huysse  MD  as permanent Chief Medical Officer (CMO).In April 2023  BioSenic received European patent from EPO  for further therapeutic development in cancer  infectious and immune diseases. The patent covers the therapeutic use of a new composite formulation of anti-inflammatory compounds with unique advantages. This new formulation lowers the dosage of arsenic trioxide by combining it with copper salts to maintain therapeutic efficacy  with the potential of administration through multiple routes  including intravenous  oral  and other novel routes of administration.In May 2023  BioSenic identified key biomarkers for cGvHD and submitted patent to EPO. The technology covered by the patent applies to a method and kit for diagnosing and monitoring cGvHD in an individual who has undergone an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and treated with ATO for a cGvHD. The patent describes biomarkers to be used to determine if the condition of a patient worsens or improves following standard or new treatments for cGvHD. This international patent could allow the development of an industrial biomarker analysis kit which could generate a turnover of 30 to 40 million euros globally.In June 2023  BioSenic put Phase 2b ALLOB trial on hold. This decision follows negative results obtained for the primary endpoint in the exploratory Phase 2b trial (ALLOB 2b)  which focused on the safety and efficacy of the treatment when applied too early  3 days after fracture.In August 2023  BioSenic received a Chinese patent protecting the combined use of metal ions and arsenic salts. This patent (ZL202080040613.1) covers the use of its ATO platform in combination with metal ions like copper  which has the potential to improve the treatment of autoimmune diseases.In September 2023  BioSenic published data providing additional key indications of its lead API (Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient) arsenic trioxide (ATO) to treat systemic sclerosis (SSc) in a peer-reviewed international journal.In September 2023  completed of a post-hoc analysis of its phase 2 clinical trial of ATO  finding the best scheme for administration of an efficient treatment of cGvHD. The analysis will be used to decide on the best oral ATO’s posology for BioSenic’s forthcoming phase 3 clinical trial.In January 2024  Dr Carole Nicco has been promoted to Chief Operating Officer (COO) in addition to her position as Chief Scientific Officer (CSO).In January 2024  BioSenic's subsidiary  Medsenic SAS  signed a binding term sheet with Phebra PTY Ltd. related to an adaptation of the License Agreement and the MDA signed in May 2021.In January 2024  BioSenic filed for a U.S. patent for JTA-004  a viscosupplement in late-stage clinical development  following a post hoc analysis showing its efficacy in a recently defined subtype of osteoarthritis (OA).In January 2024  BioSenic has been granted a patent by the Canadian Intellectual Property Office to expand protection of the arsenic trioxide (ATO) platform. The patent  titled “Use of metal ions to potentiate the therapeutic effects of arsenic”  covers the use of ATO platform in combination with metal ions such as copper.In March 2024  BioSenic published an open-access article describing an optimized schedule for administration of oral arsenic trioxide (OATO) treatment for chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGvHD)  based on an earlier post-hoc analysis of Phase II data.In June 2024  BioSenic's board of directors acknowledged the resignation of Mr Yves Sagot as an independent director of the Company  with effect from the Company's 2024 ordinary general meeting.Financial highlights (including post-period events)In February 2023  BioSenic received EUR 1 million from Pregene company in accordance with terminated license agreement.In June 2023  BioSenic has obtained an official appointment of Yves Brulard to reach a negotiated agreement with certain main creditors to preserve the value of BioSenic for the benefit of all stakeholders.In June 2023  BioSenic entered into an agreement with the ABO Securities subsidiary  Global Tech Opportunities 15  to secure short term financing based on the existing convertible bond program. Subject to the terms and conditions of the agreement  BioSenic shall be entitled to draw down three tranches of each EUR 0.3 million in June  July  and August under the existing convertible bond program  for an aggregate principal amount of EUR 0.9 million.In July 2023  BioSenic has achieved a standstill agreement from the main historical creditors for a period of 3 to 4 months. Given this agreement with the main creditors and the one obtained on 30 June 2023 with Global Tech Opportunities 15 to secure short-term financing based on the existing convertible bond program  BioSenic anticipates having sufficient cash to carry out its business objectives until October 2023.In September 2023  BioSenic reached an agreement with Patronale  Monument and the European Investment Bank for the restructuring of its key financial debts.In October 2023  BioSenic reached a definitive agreement with Global Tech Opportunities 15 (GTO15) with respect to the finalization of the existing convertible bonds program. GTO15 funder two tranches of EUR 300 000 each (minus a commission of 10%) of the existing convertible bonds program.In December 2023  BioSenic signed a term sheet with Singapore based TrialCap Pte. Ltd. and/or other lenders for a proposed debt and equity financing. BioSenic is seeking the funds to continue its clinical development  backed by previous highly promising Phase 2 and pre-clinical results of arsenic trioxide (ATO).In 2023  total operating income amounted to € 0.54 million  a slight increase compared to the same period in 2022 (€ 0.27 million). Operating loss for the period amounted to € 6.36 million  compared to € 2.32 million in 2022.BioSenic ended 2023 with € 0.12 million in cash and cash equivalents. Net cash used for the period amounted to € 1.73 million  compared to an increase of € 1.09 million over the same period of 2022.In January 2024  BioSenic signed a new subscription agreement for a maximum EUR 1.2 million convertible bonds facility  arranged by ABO Securities through its affiliated entity Global Tech Opportunities 15.In February 2024  BioSenic raised EUR 500 000 via a private placement.In April 2024  BioSenic filed a debt restructuring plan with the clerk's office of the Nivelles Enterprise Court  with a view to requesting the Court to open private judicial reorganization proceedings by collective agreement and to obtain the agreement of creditors on a plan to reorganize BioSenic's debt. Please refer to the press releases of 11 April 2024 12 April 2024 and 26 April 2024 on this subject for further information.In April 2024  in view of the debt restructuring plan  BioSenic postponed its annual general meeting of the shareholders.In May 2024  BioSenic provided its business update for the first quarter  ended the 31 March 2024.In May 2024  the Enterprise Court of Nivelles registered the positive votes of the majority of BioSenic's creditors on the debt restructuring plan.Outlook for the remainder of 2024In accordance with the BioSenic's debt restructuring plan  BioSenic envisages to retrocede its rights to the JTA and ALLOB technologies to the Walloon Region and to stop all activities in relation to such technologies.The Medsenic Phase 2 clinical study with arsenic trioxide in the first-line treatment of cGvHD has been completed and provided positive results. A Phase 3 study with oral arsenic trioxide in the first-line treatment of cGvHD  for which Medsenic received an encouraging pre-IND response from the FDA  is currently anticipated to start. A Phase 2a clinical trial for systemic lupus erythematosus (""SLE"") had previously established safety for the patient and efficacy on the course of the autoimmune disease. Positive preclinical work gives good grounds for a Phase 2 clinical trial on systemic sclerosis (""SSc""). Phase 2b clinical trials for SLE and SSc are in the planning stage.BioSenic is currently preparing the best conditions for a successful fundraising. BioSenic Group expects for 2024 to use the proceeds of anticipated future fundraisings in priority for progressing the Phase 3 clinical trial in cGvHD. As a result  it will only be possible to start the SLE and SSc Phase 2b clinical trials if the BioSenic Group succeeds in concluding a strong partnership with a biopharmaceutical company or if it manages to successfully out-license some of its technology. The start of SLE and SSc Phase II clinical trials is therefore not envisioned before 2025.Disciplined cost and cash management will remain a key priority. The operating cash burn for the full year 2024 is in the range of € 7.00 million and a financing cash burn of approximately EUR 0.80 million. The situation will be actively and closely monitored. BioSenic anticipates having sufficient cash to carry out its business objectives until Q3 2024  assuming amongst other full issuance of the Convertible Bonds and the renegotiation of the terms of the ongoing loans.Consolidated statement of comprehensive income(in thousands of euros)For the year ended31 December 2023 2022 Revenue 0 0 Other Operating income 543 266 Total revenues and operating income 543 266 Research and development expenses (3 931) (1 030) General and administrative expenses (3 651) (1 554) Operating profit/(loss) (7 040) (2 318) Financial income 59 11 Impairment expenses (16 094) 0 Financial expenses (5 954) (741) Result Profit/(loss) before taxes (29 028) (3 049) Income taxes 7 0 Result Profit/(loss) for the period (29 021) (3 049) Thereof attributable to: Owners of the Company (28 778) (2 041) Non-controlling interests (243) (1 008) Other comprehensive income Remeasurements of post-employment benefit obligations (6) (4) TOTAL COMPREHENSIVE INCOME/(LOSS) OF THE PERIOD (29 027) (3 053) Thereof attributable to: Owners of the Company (28 781) (2 043) Non-controlling interests (246) (1 010) Basic and diluted loss per share (in euros) (0.21) (0.02)Consolidated Balance SheetConsolidated Assets IFRS per:(in thousands of euros)31/12/2331/12/22Non-current assets 7 713 24 698 Goodwill 0 1 802 Intangible assets 2 989 17 293 Property  plant and equipment 698 1 419 Finance lease receivable 398 0 Investments in associates 12 12 Other non-current assets 135 136 R&D Tax Credits 3 480 4 036 Current assets 1 846 4 626 Trade and other receivables 1 315 2 490 Other current assets 272 290 Finance lease receivable 141 0 Cash and cash equivalents 117 1 846 TOTAL ASSETS 9 559 29 324Consolidated Equity & Liabilities IFRS per:(in thousands of euros)31/12/2331/12/22Share capital 6 275 4 774 Share premium 5 720 4 517 Accumulated losses (34 887) (5 723) Other reserves (20) (42) Equity attributable to owners of the parent (22 912) 3 526 Non-controlling interests 207 (402) Total Equity (22 705) 3 124 Non-current liabilities 16 420 15 847 Interest bearing borrowings 16 340 15 779 Other non-current liabilities 80 68 Current liabilities 15 844 10 353 Interest bearing borrowings 11 821 8 013 Trade and other payables 3 871 2 236 Current tax liabilities 5 0 Other current liabilities 147 104 Total liabilities 32 264 26 200 TOTAL EQUITY AND LIABILITIES 9 559 29 324Consolidated Cash Flow StatementConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows(in thousands of euros)For the 12-months period ended 31 December 2023 2022 CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES Operating profit/(loss) (7 040) (2 318) Adjustments non-cash Depreciation  Amortisation and Impairments 243 60 Grants income related to recoverable cash advances 0 20 Grants income related to patents 0 (17) Grants income related to tax credit (279) (36) Other (28) 32 Movements in working capital: Trade and other receivables (excluding public grants) 55 44 Trade and other Payables 1 634 175 Cash used in operating activities (5 417) (2 040) Cash received from grants related to recoverable cash advances 61 61 Cash received from grants related to patents 11 0 Cash received from license agreement 940 0 Cash received from grants related to tax credit 935 69 Income taxes paid 0 0 Net cash used in operating activities (3 470) (1 910) CASH FLOW FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES Interests received 0 1 Acquisition of subsidiary 0 1 956 Purchases of property  plant and equipment 3 (5) Disposal of property  plant and equipment 3 0 Net cash generated from investing activities 6 1 952 CASH FLOW FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES Repayment of borrowings (275) (180) Proceeds from government loans 0 26 Repayment of government loans 0 (81) Proceeds from convertible borrowings 1 000 1 000 Repayments of lease liabilities (186) (4) Repayments of interest free advances (138) (150) Repayment of related parties loans 0 (13) Interests paid (28) (31) Transaction costs (137) (22) Proceeds from issue of equity instruments of the Company 1 500 500 Net cash generated from financing activities 1 735 1 045 NET INCREASE (DECREASE) IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS (1 729) 1 087 CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS at beginning of the period 1 846 759 CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS at end of the period 117 1 846Consolidated statement of changes in equityAttributable to owners of the parent Non-controlling interestsTOTALEQUITY(in thousands of euros)Share capitalShare premiumAccumulated Losses & Other reservesOther elements of comprehensive incomeBalance at 1 January 2022 664 3 969 (7 298) (5) 0 (2 670) Total comprehensive income of the period 0 0 (3 049) (4) 0 (3 053) Issue of share capital 874 4 372 0 0 0 5 246 Reverse acquisition: 3 236 (3 824) 4 546 43 (402) 3 598 1.

Key target indications for the autoimmune platform include graft-versus-host-disease (GvHD)  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  and now systemic sclerosis (SSc).Following the merger in October 2022  BioSenic combined the strategic positionings and strengths of Medsenic and Bone Therapeutics. The merger specifically enables Medsenic/Biosenic to develop an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/oral ATO (OATO).BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com .About the main Medsenic/BioSenic technology platformThe ATO platform provides derived active products with immunomodulatory properties and fundamental effects on the activated cells of the immune system. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. cGvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT).Medsenic has been successful in a phase 2 trial with its intravenous formulation  Arscimed®  which has orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA. The company is heading towards an international phase 3 confirmatory study  with its new  IP-protected  OATO formulation. Another selected target is moderate-to-severe forms of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae  and the gastrointestinal tract). Systemic sclerosis is now full part of the clinical pipeline of Medsenic/BioSenic. This serious chronic disease badly affects skin  lungs  or vascularization  and has no current effective treatment. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive  giving good grounds to launch a phase 2 clinical protocol  using new immunomodulatory formulations of APIs recognized to be active on the immune system.The company is currently focusing its present R&D and clinical activities on a selective  accelerated development of its autoimmune platform.Note: The allogeneic cell therapy platform-originating from the previous listed company Bone Therapeutics company  may be of renewed interest by using isolated and purified differentiated bone marrow Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) as a starting material for further isolation of passive or active biological subcellular elements. Indeed  these cells may provide new subcellular vesicles potentially able to deliver a unique and proprietary approach to organ repair. BioSenic is now involved in determining new patentable approaches in this complex area of cell therapy.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAFrançois Rieger  PhD  CEOTel: +33 (0)671 73 31 59investorrelations@biosenic.comCertain statements  beliefs and opinions in this press release are forward-looking  which reflect the company or  as appropriate  the company directors’ current expectations and projections about future events.
