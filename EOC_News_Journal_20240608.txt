Responding to a question from RIA Novosti about the IMF’s view on the G7’s plans for the assets  IMF spokeswoman Julie Kozack said any move regarding the assets must have a sound legal basis.The US and a number of EU nations have been looking for ways to use the funds to finance Ukraine’s military and future reconstruction.“We have made our position clear and open. The IMF believes that any actions taken must have a sufficient legal basis and do not undermine the functioning of the international monetary system ” RIA Novosti quoted Kozack as saying at a press briefing on Thursday.Kozak made similar statements in April and May  as did the director of the IMF European Department  Alfred Kammer  and IMF First Deputy Managing Director Gita Gopinath.The EU and G7 nations have blocked an estimated $300 billion in assets belonging to the Russian state since the start of the Ukraine conflict in 2022. The bulk of this amount  nearly €197 billion ($214 billion) is being held by Belgium-based clearinghouse Euroclear. The securities depository reported earlier this year that the sanctioned assets it holds accumulated roughly €4.4 billion in interest in 2023.The US and its allies are nearing an agreement on plans to provide Ukraine with a multibillion-dollar loan which would be serviced from the profits accrued from frozen Russian sovereign assets  US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said earlier this week.G7 leaders will tackle the issue at the group’s summit in Italy next week.Kiev’s Western backers generally agree that the frozen assets should be used to aid Ukraine  but the EU’s financial regulator has warned that the move could have serious legal risks.European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde warned in April that any plans to use Russian assets or profits from them would undermine the international rule of law  with unforeseeable consequences.Russia has said that any actions taken against its assets would amount to “theft ” stressing that seizing the funds or similar moves would violate international law and lead to retaliation.For more stories on economy & finance visit RT's business section,neutral,0.04,0.92,0.04,negative,0.02,0.24,0.74,True,English,"['IMF comments', 'Russian assets', 'Ukraine', 'European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde', 'US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen', 'IMF First Deputy Managing Director', 'central bank reserves', 'frozen Russian sovereign assets', 'IMF European Department', 'sufficient legal basis', 'global monetary system', 'sound legal basis', 'Belgium-based clearinghouse Euroclear', 'serious legal risks', 'International Monetary Fund', 'international monetary system', 'The US', 'Russian state', 'frozen assets', 'IMF spokeswoman', 'The IMF', 'international rule', 'Russian assets', 'RIA Novosti', 'future reconstruction', 'press briefing', 'similar statements', 'Alfred Kammer', 'Gita Gopinath', 'securities depository', 'multibillion-dollar loan', 'Western backers', 'financial regulator', 'unforeseeable consequences', 'similar moves', 'international law', 'business section', 'EU nations', 'The EU', 'G7 nations', 'G7 leaders', 'Julie Kozack', 'Western plans', 'Ukraine conflict', 'agency', 'spokesperson', 'question', 'view', 'number', 'ways', 'funds', 'military', 'position', 'actions', 'functioning', 'Thursday', 'Kozak', 'April', 'May', 'start', 'bulk', 'amount', 'interest', 'allies', 'agreement', 'profits', 'issue', 'group', 'summit', 'Italy', 'Kiev', 'retaliation', 'stories', 'economy', 'finance']",2024-06-07,2024-06-08,rt.com

42366,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.fairobserver.com/business/fo-crucible-money-matters-in-a-multipolar-world-part-3/,FO° Crucible: Money Matters in a Multipolar World  Part 3,On April 10  only a few days after Ed Quince’s pessimistic take on geopolitics  Alex Gloy came back to focus attention on the current position of the dollar: At the risk of boring you to death I feel compelled to add a little twist on my musings on the dollar…,On April 10  only a few days after Ed Quince’s pessimistic take on geopolitics  Alex Gloy came back to focus attention on the current position of the dollar:At the risk of boring you to death I feel compelled to add a little twist on my musings on the dollar.First  you can do the following exercise: try to find out (Google it!) how many dollars exist. Possibly the simplest question you can ask. That number should be known  right?If I asked how many dollars  euros  etc. you own you would look it up in your bank statements (and by reaching into your back pocket). Every company needs to keep books. Same for governments. The number should be knowable. Yet you get many  vastly varying answers. A lot of search results will lead you to something like “at the end of last year  the estimated amount of debt was …” And you are stupefied  because you didn’t ask for debt  you asked for the number of dollars.The riddle solves itself once you realize you can’t create money without simultaneously creating the same amount debt. Hence money must equal debt  and vice versa. You can figure out the number of dollars outstanding by just looking at debt. Which leads to the next problem: how much debt is there outstanding? (My smallest estimate is $93 trillion USD onshore plus $40-60 trillion USD offshore).To complicate things  BIS (Bank for International Settlements  the central bank of central banks  recently reported $60 trillion in ‘hidden’ USD debt in the form of foreign exchange swap positions. A derivative contract becomes debt if a defined event happens (for example  a currency moves a certain amount  or interest rates). BIS  in their latest report (H1 2023)  shows an astounding $714 trillion of global derivatives outstanding  most of them denominated in USD.Dollars are not equal to dollars. When living in Germany  I had a USD account in my name at my local bank (because I held some USD denominated bonds  and I wanted to avoid being charged FX fees each time the bond paid interest in USD). In preparation for a trip to the US I wanted to withdraw a small amount of dollars in cash from this account to avoid the big surcharge when buying foreign currency at the counter. The bank claimed this was impossible. I couldn’t believe it  but it is true. The dollars in my account were not in Germany. The bank  Commerzbank  has a US bank which holds a USD-denominated account for Commerzbank Germany. Every local non-US bank needs a “correspondent bank” to be able to offer USD payment services. If an Indonesian exporter of palm oil invoices his client  he will ask for the dollars to be sent to a certain account at “JPMorganChase for Bank Mandiri” (for example). The dollars never leave the US. This is why it is so easy for the US to cut off entire countries from access to USD – you simply tell US banks they’d be in trouble if they continued to bank with entities from certain regions.Side note: SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications) is simply a messaging system  where participants exchange account information. You could still convey that information by phone  for example. Russia wasn’t cut off from dollars because they couldn’t use SWIFT anymore – they were cut off because US banks weren’t allowed to act as correspondent banks for Russian entities.This enables the US to determine who gets access to the most important currency.But it doesn’t end there. Out of approximately $7.5 trillion in US Treasury securities held by foreigners  around half ($3.2 trillion) are held in custody for “foreign official accounts” (central banks  sovereign wealth funds) at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. If you are the Bank of Japan  or Swiss National Bank  FRBNY is your broker. They hold your Treasury securities. If you wanted to “punish” the US and dump all your Treasuries into the market  you’d have to call in your sell order. And the person on the other side would simply hang up.There are ways to have US securities held abroad. Euroclear  for example  is a European custodian for US Treasuries. This is why tiny Belgium (where Euroclear is located) regularly shows up among the largest non-US holders of US Treasuries. According to rumors  the Chinese hold substantial amounts of US Treasuries via Europe.Similarly  the FRBNY holds substantial amounts of gold for “foreign and international accounts” (the distinction is unclear to me). They call it “earmarked” gold  valued at $42.22 per ounce. An arcane regulation in US Code (USC 5116-5117) makes valuing gold in official transactions at more than 42 dollars and two eleventh per ounce unlawful. Anyway  FRBNY holds nearly $8 billion worth of gold valued at $42.22 an ounce  which translates into 189 million ounces (or nearly 6 000 tonnes)  currently worth $443 billion. Small amounts of gold are stored below JFK airport (for trading)  but most is under the control of the US military at West Point  NY and Fort Knox  KY. After WWII  Germany  the Netherlands and other European countries stored part of their gold in New York  tucked away safely in case of a Russian invasion into Western Europe. Recently (2013-2016)  Germany and Netherlands “repatriated” some of their gold from New York. This was  of course  a very sensitive and political issue. But you don’t want to wake up one day  trying to access your gold  only to hear that it is gone (confiscated  sold or lent out).A digital dollar abroad is hence either a credit by a US institution (local dollars) or a non-US institution (in which case they are so-called Eurodollars). Access to dollars for non-US participants usually means access to dollar-denominated credit. During financial crisis  credit becomes tight (unavailable  or only at punitive rates). Since money is only created by issuing credit  lack of lending leads to dollar shortage.Digital dollars are created by issuing credit and destroyed by redemption of said credit. In a crisis  lenders are less willing to extend risky loans  licking their wounds from credit losses  forcing redemption and hence reducing the number of dollars outstanding. This is why you often see the dollar strengthening during times of crisis.The power of the US dollar extends well beyond its function as global currency for pricing of goods and commodities; it dictates access to credit to many emerging market economies (which lack sufficient savings due to distrust in their local currency).Digesting such a rich mealSeveral members of the team thanked Alex for clarifying so many complementary pieces of information  This proved — to me at least — that for a “Candide” like myself there is no simple way to line up all the pieces of the puzzle  with their odd colors and shapes  and claim that we can assemble them into a distinct landscape with a clear message. Unless  of course  people like myself decide that the message is the same that Voltaire’s gave us in the conclusion of Candide: Let the financiers  the experts and philosophers carry on as usual  while the rest of us focus on tending our own gardens.Without yet giving up  I responded to Alex  attempting to identify themes that might make sense to me  while at the same time signaling another element that caught my attention.My takeaway — which may be completely misguided  so please correct any of my speculation — is that there are three levels of reality that need to be analyzed.The mechanics of debt  obviously complicated in all the ways you’ve described.the psychology of control via the manipulation of the mechanics of debt. I assume everyone — governments  banks and holders of funds — is maneuvering to optimize control).The exercise of power  which raises the question of sovereignty and may be approached from either a political or financial position and more probably a combination of the two.The ensemble is too complex for any single party or cabal of powerful interests to control. Nevertheless  what I would call the “cultural position” of the dollar places the US at the summit of the power game. But even if labelled in dollars — which have the easily perceived advantage of providing some kind of clarity — the status of debt can be obfuscated  transformed and even undermined by specific events (a meltdown or a crash) that could  at a given moment  change the power relationships.Now I’ve just come across an article in Forbes quoting billionaire Tim Draper:“Draper predicted the U.S. dollar will go the way of the Confederate dollar after the U.S. civil war  eventually becoming ‘completely worthless’ and triggering bank runs.”“There will be a moment in time  and I don’t know whether it’s a day or a month or maybe over the course of two months or something  but I don’t know when it will start  whether it’ll be a year or five years or whatever  maybe even ten years out ” Draper said. “But it’ll happen very rapidly.”Is Draper just speculating  the same way we speculate about wars that cannot be predicted through scientific analysis but do occur regularly? The article focuses on speculation about the future of bitcoin  which you haven’t mentioned. My sense of what the Forbes article is saying is that bitcoin is capable of providing the spark that ignites the conflagration everyone else is maneuvering to avoid. So that raises two questions:How could bitcoin or crypto in general muddy or even poison the waters?Is bitcoin important enough or a cataclysmic bitcoin event likely enough to take seriously?In short  how many balls have we put in the jugglers’ hands? And how skilled are any of the jugglers?Alex replied with these words:Thank you! Of course  I see geopolitics through the viewpoint of finance  which excludes other valid viewpoints. For example  it is hard to explain the US’ support for Israel (which will — most likely — cost Biden the presidency) with financial considerations.So  we come back to geopolitics as well as current events. The discussion continued and is still developing. More pieces of the puzzle appear regularly.

Overview of Argentine Electricity MarketTransactions among different participants in the electricity industry take place through the wholesale electricity market (""WEM"") which is a market in which generators  distributors and certain large users of electricity buy and sell electricity at prices determined by supply and demand (""Term market"") and also  where prices are established on an hourly basis based on the economic production cost  represented by the short term marginal cost measured at the system's load center (""Spot market""). CAMMESA (Compañía Administradora del Mercado Mayorista Eléctrico Sociedad Anónima) is a quasi-government organization that was established to administer the WEM and functions as a clearing house for the different market participants operating in the WEM. Its main functions include the operation of the WEM and dispatch of generation and price calculation in the Spot market  the real-time operation of the electricity system and the administration of the commercial transactions in the electricity market.After the Argentine economic crisis in 2001 and 2002 and the Convertibility Law  the costs of generators increased as a result of the Argentine peso devaluation. In addition  the price of fuel for their generation increased as well. The increasing generation costs combined with the freezing of rates for the final user decided at the time by National Government led to a permanent deficit in CAMMESA accounts  which faced difficulties to pay the energy purchases to generators. Due to this structural deficit  the Secretariat of Energy issued a series of regulations to keep the electricity market working despite the deficit.1.2. Amendments to WEM regulationsa) Secretariat of Energy Resolution No. 574/2023  2/2024 and 33/2024On July 11  2023  Resolution No. 574/2023 was published  which extended for 60 days (with the possibility of being extended for 60 days more) the termination date for the Concession Agreement of the Hydroelectric Power Station Piedra del Águila  among other Argentine Hydroelectric Power Stations  whose concession term ends during 2023.On January 17  2024  through Resolution No. 2/2024  published in the Official Gazette  the transition period of the concession agreement was extended for 60 days as from February 28  2024. Then  through Resolution No. 33/2024  published in the Official Gazette on March 18  2024  the termination term of the concession agreement was extended again for 60 days as from April 28  2024  so that such term expires on June 27  2024.b) Secretariat of Energy Resolution No. 9/2024On February 8  2024  Resolution No. 9/2024 (""Resolution 9"") of the Secretariat of Energy was published in the Official Gazette. This Resolution updated the power and energy remuneration values of the generation not committed under contracts. In addition  Exhibits I to IV of Resolution 869 were replaced and a 74% increase as from February 1  2024 was established.- 11 -English translation of the consolidated financial statements originally filed in Spanish with the Argentine Securities Commission (""CNV"").In case of discrepancy  the consolidated financial statements filed with the CNV prevail over this translationCENTRAL PUERTO S.Ac) Secretariat of Energy Resolution No. 58/2024 and 66/2024On May 8  2024  Secretariat of Energy Resolution No. 58/2024 as amended by Resolution No. 66/2024 was published in the Official Gazette (the ""Resolution"") whereby an exceptional  temporary  and unique payment regime was established for MEM transactions for December 2023  and January and February 2024. Such Resolution (i) orders CAMMESA to prepare and determine the amounts of the credit for the economic transactions with each of MEM Creditor Agents in a term of 5 (five) working days as from the entering into force of the Resolution; (ii) establishes that the lack of agreement regarding such amounts authorizes the Creditor Agents to resort to the corresponding judicial  administrative and/or out-of-court means; (iii) and establishes that once the amounts are determined and the corresponding agreements entered into  CAMMESA shall pay the transactions as follows: a) the settlement for the transactions for December 2023 and January 2024 shall be paid 10 (ten) working days counted as from the date of individual agreements through the delivery of bond AE38 USD; the calculation of nominal amounts to be delivered per each bond shall be at the reference exchange rate (Communication ""A"" 3500) at the quote in force at closing on the date of the formal acceptance by Creditor Agents; b) settlement for February 2024 shall be paid with available funds in bank accounts authorized in CAMMESA for collection and with the available funds for the transferences made by the Argentine State to the Unified Fund destined at the Stabilization Fund.

Consequently  the financial statements are stated in the current measurement unit at the end of the reported period.The effects caused by the application of IAS 29 are detailed in note 2.2.2 to the issued consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31  2023.Regard being had to the mentioned index  the inflation was of 51.62% and 21.74% in the three-month periods ended March 31  2024 and 2023  respectively.2.3. Changes in accounting policiesNew standards and interpretations adoptedAs from the fiscal year beginning January 1  2024  the Group has applied for the first time certain new and/or amended standards and interpretations as issued by the IASB.Below is a brief description of the new and/or amended standards and interpretations adopted by the Group and their impact on these consolidated financial statements.Amendments to IAS 1: Classification of Liabilities as Current or Non-currentIn January 2020 and October 2022  the IASB issued amendments to paragraphs 69 to 76 of IAS 1 to specify the requirements for classifying liabilities as current or non-current. The amendments clarify: (i) What is meant by a right to defer settlement; (ii) that a right to defer must exist at the end of the reporting period; (iii) that classification is unaffected by the likelihood that an entity will exercise its deferral right and (iv) that only if an embedded derivative in a convertible liability is itself an equity instrument would the terms of a liability not impact its classification.In addition  a requirement has been introduced to require disclosure when a liability arising from a loan agreement is classified as non-current and the entity's right to defer settlement is contingent on compliance with future covenants within twelve months.These amendments have not had a significant impact on the Group's condensed financial statements.Supplier Finance Arrangements - Amendments to IAS 7 and IFRS 7In May 2023  the IASB issued amendments to IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows and IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures to clarify the characteristics of supplier finance arrangements and require additional disclosure of such arrangements. The disclosure requirements in the amendments are intended to assist users of financial statements in understanding the effects of supplier finance arrangements on an entity's liabilities  cash flows and exposure to liquidity risk.The transition rules clarify that an entity is not required to present information in any interim period in the year of initial application of the amendments. Therefore  these amendments have had no significant impact on the Group's condensed financial statements.- 13 -English translation of the consolidated financial statements originally filed in Spanish with the Argentine Securities Commission (""CNV"").In case of discrepancy  the consolidated financial statements filed with the CNV prevail over this translationCENTRAL PUERTO S.AAmendments to IFRS 16: Lease liability in subsequent sale and leasebackIn September 2022  IASB issued amendments to IFRS 16 to clarify the requirements a seller-lessee uses to measure liabilities in a leaseback from a subsequent sale and leaseback transaction to guarantee the seller- lessee does not recognize any amount of the gain or loss that relates to the right of use it retains.These amendments have not had a significant impact on the Group's condensed financial statements.3.

Measures in the Argentine economyOn December 10  2023  new government authorities took office  which authorities issued a series of measures among whose main objectives the following stand out: flexibility of regulations for economic development  reduction of expenses towards reducing fiscal deficit  reduction of subsidies  among others. Within the context of the new government  there was a significant devaluation of the Argentine peso which was reflected on the official exchange rate.Foreign exchange marketAs from December 2019  the BCRA issued a series of communications whereby it extended indefinitely the regulations on Foreign Market and Foreign Exchange Market issued by BCRA that included regulations on exports  imports and previous authorization from BCRA to access the foreign exchange market to transfer profits and dividends abroad  as well as other restrictions on the operation in the foreign exchange market.Particularly  as from September 16  2020  Communication ""A"" 7106 established  among other measures referred to human persons  the need for refinancing the international financial indebtedness for those loans from the non-financial private sector with a creditor not being a related counterparty of the debtor expiring between October 15  2020 and March 31  2021. The affected legal entities were to submit before the Central Bank a refinancing plan under certain criteria: that the net amount for which the foreign exchange market was to be accessed in the original terms did not exceed 40% of the capital amount due for that period and that the remaining capital had been  as a minimum  refinanced with a new external indebtedness with an average life of 2 years. This point shall not be applicable when indebtedness is taken from international entities and official credit agencies  among others. As from April 1  2021  through Communication ""A"" 7230  BCRA decided to establish at the equivalent of USD 2 million the maximum amount per calendar month whereby the debtor would access the foreign exchange market for repaying the indebtedness described in point 7 of Communication ""A"" 7106  operating until December 31  2021 (successively extended until December 31  2023 through BCRA Communications ""A"" 7466 and 7621). Since December 31  2023  the provisions on point 7 of Communication ""A"" 7106 (as amended and extended) have had no more effects. The effects of this regulation for the Company are described in Notes 7.3.3 and 7.3.11.As of the issuance date of these financial statements  after the new authorities took office on December 10  2023  the restrictions for the payment of imports with customs entry record prior to December 13  2023 were reduced  while other BCRA restrictions to access to the Unique and Free Exchange Rate Market and to operate in the exchange rate market are kept.Income TaxOn June 16  2021  the Argentine Executive Power passed Law No. 27630  which established changes in the corporate income tax rate for the fiscal periods commencing as from January 1  2021. Such law establishes payment of the tax based on a structure of staggered rates regarding the level of accumulated taxable net income. The estimated amounts in this scale will be annually adjusted  considering the annual variation of the consumer price index provided by the INDEC corresponding to October of the year prior to the adjustment compared with the same month of the previous year. For fiscal year 2023 the applicable scale was the following: 25% up to an accumulated taxable net income of 14.3 million Ps.; 30% for the excess of such amount up to 143 million Ps.; and 35% for the excess of such amount. Meanwhile  for fiscal year 2024 the applicable scale is the following: 25% up to an accumulated taxable net income of 102.3 million Ps.; 30% for the excess of such amount up to 347 million Ps.; and 35% for the excess of such amount.14. Restrictions on income distributionPursuant to the General Legal Entities Law and the Bylaws  5% of the profits made during the fiscal year must be assigned to the statutory reserve until such reserve reaches 20% of the Company's Capital Stock.The profits that are distributed to human persons of Argentina and abroad and foreign legal entities are subject to a withholding of 7% as dividend tax  to the extent that such profits correspond to fiscal years closed after December 31  2017.- 30 -English translation of the consolidated financial statements originally filed in Spanish with the Argentine Securities Commission (""CNV"").In case of discrepancy  the consolidated financial statements filed with the CNV prevail over this translationEXHIBIT ACENTRAL PUERTO S.A.PROPERTY  PLANT AND EQUIPMENTAS OF MARCH 31  2024 AND AS OF DECEMBER 31  202303-31-2024 Cost At the beginning Additions Transfers Disposals At the end ARS 000 ARS 000 ARS 000 ARS 000 ARS 000 Lands and buildings 294 572 971 1 776 779 -

Traditional TCEs targeting ‘cold’ tumors have limited efficacy due to poor T cell quality and exhaustion. Marengo’s proprietary first-in-class TriSTAR TCEs have the potential to overcome these limitations  redirecting a new and expanded pool of highly activated memory Vβ T cells to the tumor. The teams will focus on exploring potential in ‘cold’ tumors which typically fail to trigger a strong immune response when treated with TCEs.“We take a science-first approach to expanding our pipeline and are delighted to continue our strong work with the teams at Marengo  who share our passion and drive to accelerate cancer innovations ” said David Jenkins  SVP  Research and External Innovation at Ipsen. “Through Marengo’s next-generation TriSTAR platform we have the potential to unlock the power of the immune system  activating a wider pool of T cells to eradicate tumors that traditionally have a weak response to T-cell immunotherapies.”“We are excited to build on our existing research collaboration with Ipsen  which has already successfully delivered the first development candidate earlier this year ” said Zhen Su  CEO of Marengo Therapeutics. “This new collaboration with Ipsen builds on our clinically validated TCR Vβ platform and our internal work with new TriSTAR T cell engagers that suggest best-in-class potential and the ultimate precision IO goal of delivering the right T cells to the right tumor. The TriSTAR platform significantly expands our portfolio to target difficult-to-treat ‘cold’ tumors  and we are thrilled to partner with the Ipsen oncology team to realize this ambition together.”Under the terms of the agreement  Ipsen will assume responsibility for all activities following development candidate nomination. Marengo will receive an upfront payment and potential payments up to a total of $1.2 billion if all milestones are met in addition to tiered sales royalty payments.ENDSAbout IpsenWe are a global biopharmaceutical company with a focus on bringing transformative medicines to patients in three therapeutic areas: Oncology  Rare Disease and Neuroscience.Our pipeline is fueled by external innovation and supported by nearly 100 years of development experience and global hubs in the U.S.  France and the U.K. Our teams in more than 40 countries and our partnerships around the world enable us to bring medicines to patients in more than 80 countries.Ipsen is listed in Paris (Euronext: IPN) and in the U.S. through a Sponsored Level I American Depositary Receipt program (ADR: IPSEY).

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law.

It notably aims to achieve 50% of its sales through digital channels (vs 28% in 2023); reach 15+ automated Distribution Centers and 500+ robots in its supply chain (vs 10 automated DCs and 325 robots today); and increase the share of customers using additional services to 70% (vs 50% today) and advanced services to 20% (vs 11% today). On the sustainability side  Rexel will continue to actively implement its ambitious carbon roadmap  approved by the SBTi Net Zero Standard  in particular through additional initiatives involving customers  suppliers and employees of Rexel.Seizing acceleration businesses in an electrifying market:Rexel’s growth has been supported in the past years by powerful electrification megatrends that underpin the quest for a lower-carbon world.

Traditional TCEs targeting ‘cold’ tumors have limited efficacy due to poor T cell quality and exhaustion. Marengo’s proprietary first-in-class TriSTAR TCEs have the potential to overcome these limitations  redirecting a new and expanded pool of highly activated memory Vβ T cells to the tumor. The teams will focus on exploring potential in ‘cold’ tumors which typically fail to trigger a strong immune response when treated with TCEs.“We take a science-first approach to expanding our pipeline and are delighted to continue our strong work with the teams at Marengo  who share our passion and drive to accelerate cancer innovations ” said David Jenkins  SVP  Research and External Innovation at Ipsen. “Through Marengo’s next-generation TriSTAR platform we have the potential to unlock the power of the immune system  activating a wider pool of T cells to eradicate tumors that traditionally have a weak response to T-cell immunotherapies.”“We are excited to build on our existing research collaboration with Ipsen  which has already successfully delivered the first development candidate earlier this year ” said Zhen Su  CEO of Marengo Therapeutics. “This new collaboration with Ipsen builds on our clinically validated TCR Vβ platform and our internal work with new TriSTAR T cell engagers that suggest best-in-class potential and the ultimate precision IO goal of delivering the right T cells to the right tumor. The TriSTAR platform significantly expands our portfolio to target difficult-to-treat ‘cold’ tumors  and we are thrilled to partner with the Ipsen oncology team to realize this ambition together.”Under the terms of the agreement  Ipsen will assume responsibility for all activities following development candidate nomination. Marengo will receive an upfront payment and potential payments up to a total of $1.2 billion if all milestones are met in addition to tiered sales royalty payments.ENDSAbout IpsenWe are a global biopharmaceutical company with a focus on bringing transformative medicines to patients in three therapeutic areas: Oncology  Rare Disease and Neuroscience.Our pipeline is fueled by external innovation and supported by nearly 100 years of development experience and global hubs in the U.S.  France and the U.K. Our teams in more than 40 countries and our partnerships around the world enable us to bring medicines to patients in more than 80 countries.Ipsen is listed in Paris (Euronext: IPN) and in the U.S. through a Sponsored Level I American Depositary Receipt program (ADR: IPSEY).

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements.

Traditional TCEs targeting ˜cold' tumors have limited efficacy due to poor T cell quality and exhaustion. Marengo's proprietary first-in-class TriSTAR TCEs have the potential to overcome these limitations  redirecting a new and expanded pool of highly activated memory VÎ² T cells to the tumor. The teams will focus on exploring potential in ˜cold' tumors which typically fail to trigger a strong immune response when treated with TCEs.We take a science-first approach to expanding our pipeline and are delighted to continue our strong work with the teams at Marengo  who share our passion and drive to accelerate cancer innovations  said David Jenkins  SVP  Research and External Innovation at Ipsen. Through Marengo's next-generation TriSTAR platform we have the potential to unlock the power of the immune system  activating a wider pool of T cells to eradicate tumors that traditionally have a weak response to T-cell immunotherapies.We are excited to build on our existing research collaboration with Ipsen  which has already successfully delivered the first development candidate earlier this year  said Zhen Su  CEO of Marengo Therapeutics. This new collaboration with Ipsen builds on our clinically validated TCR VÎ² platform and our internal work with new TriSTAR T cell engagers that suggest best-in-class potential and the ultimate precision IO goal of delivering the right T cells to the right tumor. The TriSTAR platform significantly expands our portfolio to target difficult-to-treat ˜cold' tumors  and we are thrilled to partner with the Ipsen oncology team to realize this ambition together.Under the terms of the agreement  Ipsen will assume responsibility for all activities following development candidate nomination. Marengo will receive an upfront payment and potential payments up to a total of $1.2 billion if all milestones are met in addition to tiered sales royalty payments.ENDSAbout IpsenWe are a global biopharmaceutical company with a focus on bringing transformative medicines to patients in three therapeutic areas: Oncology  Rare Disease and Neuroscience.Our pipeline is fueled by external innovation and supported by nearly 100 years of development experience and global hubs in the U.S.  France and the U.K. Our teams in more than 40 countries and our partnerships around the world enable us to bring medicines to patients in more than 80 countries.Ipsen is listed in Paris (Euronext: IPN) and in the U.S. through a Sponsored Level I American Depositary Receipt program (ADR: IPSEY).

As well he might. The former chief executive of Aer Lingus owner International Airlines Group (IAG) said revenue for the industry is set to rise 10 per cent this year to within a whisker of $1 trillion (€920 billion) – a record  and almost a fifth higher than pre-pandemic levels.IATA also upgraded its net profit forecast for the sector by 19 per cent from its last attempt in December  to $30.5 billion – even as the industry grapples with rising labour costs and the impact of heightened interest rates on consumers and financing aircraft fleets.“That’s not a record  unfortunately ” he told the IATA annual general meeting at the JW Marriott Marquis Hotel in Dubai in relation to the profit figure. “But considering where we were just a few years ago  it is a major achievement.” (The sector racked up almost $180 billion of losses between 2020 and 2021.)Still  he lamented that the profit per passenger these days amounts to a little over $6. “That buys you a single espresso in this hotel’s coffee shop.”READ MOREThe need for airlines to squeeze as much money as possible out of passengers should play into the hands of Irish travel retail software company Datalex  which has gone through a massive restructuring – and refocusing – since it was the subject of an accounting scandal five years ago.Under a turnaround management team that was led by tech industry veteran Sean Corkery  the company went from being one that built bespoke  and expensive  systems for airlines to essentially selling off-the-shelf products designed to help carriers get the most out of customers.These include products for airlines taking direct bookings  taking more control over sales through online travel aggregators  adapting fares for seats and baggage in response to demand fluctuating demand  and flogging add-ons at every opportunity. The company has even joined the artificial intelligence (AI) frenzy by designing a pricing system that  according to its pitch  has “market-leading reasoning  which mimics human decision-making”.[ Datalex reviews long-term strategy as 2023 revenue to top forecast ]At a special investors’ day in London just over a year ago  he said Datalex saw its turnover doubling to almost $47 million between 2022 and 2026 – with its gross profit margin rising at the same pace to 55-60 per cent. Corkery stepped down late last year and was succeeded by Jonathan Rockett  the former managing director and chief financial officer of mobile top-up firm Ding.That investor-day presentation predicted the total addressable market for its products would explode from $800 million in 2019 to $3 billion by the end of this decade. However  the perennial problem with Datalex – whose range of customers include Aer Lingus  EasyJet  JetBlue and Air China – has been the pace at which it can deliver on its promise.Datalex has yet to call its own agm. Indeed  investors haven’t even had sight of its 2023 annual report. It only has three weeks to publish this – six months after the end of the financial period – to avoid being in breach of rules for the Euronext Growth marketThe company issued a relatively short “trading update” in late March for 2023  revealing figures that were pretty much in line with what the market had expected.But Datalex highlighted that while it had entered 2024 “with a strong recurring revenue base and has a solid pipeline of growth that will be unlocked as new customers are activated further”  it suggested that a bump in transaction-based revenue from new customers would likely be delayed until next year.This prompted Dudley Shanley  an analyst with Datalex’s corporate broker Goodbody Stockbrokers  to slash his total revenue forecast for the company for this year by a third to $28.4 million.American Airlines – while not a customer of Datalex – recently highlighted perils of airlines moving too aggressively to take more control of bookings. It swung into a loss for the first quarter as the strategy alienated corporate travellers and agents.“We moved faster than we should  and we didn’t execute well ” the carrier’s chief executive  Robert Isom  told investors its annual general meeting (agm) last week.Datalex has yet to call its own agm. Indeed  investors haven’t even had sight of its 2023 annual report. It only has three weeks to publish this – six months after the end of the financial period – to avoid being in breach of rules for the Euronext Growth market.A spokeswoman told The Irish Times that the report will be issued during the trading week commencing June 18th. “The new management team is looking forward to meeting and engaging with shareholders and analysts to bring them through full-year 2023 highlights  and future plans and opportunities for the group.”The new team also includes Stephen Moloney  a former finance executive with payments fintech Block  who joined as chief financial officer in April.It is understood that the delay in finalising the annual report centres on €15 million of loan facilities the company has from billionaire Dermot Desmond  its largest shareholder with a stake of more than 40 per cent. The loans  issued through Desmond’s Tireragh vehicle  carry an interest rate of 18 per cent and are due to be repaid by the end of 2024.Datalex’s management will find it difficult to sign off on the accounts as a going concern (essentially that it has the ability to remain in business for at least the next 12 months) unless a firm plan is in place either to extend the time frame of the loans or raise equity to refinance them.Realistically  the company is likely to need to raise a similar amount of money to provide it with comfortable financial headroom as revenue from new contracts take longer than originally expected to hit top gear  according to observers.Sources said 12 months ago that the company was reluctant to proceed with a share sale amid unease among existing investors about its depressed share price at the time when it was trading at 54 cent.A year later and the share price has fallen further  to 46 cent.
