(""VGP"")  a pan-European owner  manager and developer of high-quality logistics and semi-industrial properties as well as a provider of renewable energy solutions  will develop the new “grEEn-campus” in Rüsselsheim for Opel  a brand of Stellantis N.V. The project has been publicly unveiled today at the ""125 Years of Automotive Production at Opel"" anniversary celebration at the Opel headquarters in Rüsselsheim  Germany  in the presence of German Chancellor Olaf Scholz.VGP will develop on a land plot of 105 000 m² an office building  engineering building and design center as well as parking lots  as part of the so-called “grEEn-campus Rüsselsheim”. The campus will also provide space for recreation  café and meeting areas.Jan Van Geet  CEO of VGP: “We are excited about the partnership with Opel. This project is another milestone for us at VGP  and we expect to be able to start up the development in the coming period. Recently  we have been able to sign a string of iconic future-oriented reindustrialisation projects and we are proud to be able to contribute in this way to the rejuvenation of European industry.”Opel CEO Florian Huettl says: “The grEEn-campus will be a place for exchanging and sharing ideas to promote creativity  efficiency and competitiveness  and ultimately create a highly desirable work environment. We are excited to have VGP as a very competent partner to realize this landmark project.”The ""grEEn-campus” is part of the historic Opel production site partly procured by VGP in November 2023. With a total area exceeding 700 000 m²  the three plots of land in Rüsselsheim am Main represent VGP´s largest brownfield project to date.Beside building the campus for Opel  VGP will develop at VGP Park Rüsselsheim tailormade solutions for industrial companies and small and medium-sized value-added businesses for which it currently has already some very advanced ongoing negotiations. In line with its commitment to responsible development  VGP will operate with care to optimize the benefits of the development for the local community in close coordination with the responsible authorities.VGP aims for an ambitious environmental approach for the park  committing to achieving a minimum DGNB Gold certification for all buildings. In addition  VGP aims to prove the conformity of its property with EU Taxonomy. The new park will be largely independent from the grid as it will benefit from existing electricity facilities and water treatment and recycling services. Rooftops are expected to be equipped with photovoltaic panels and a geothermal system is projected to contribute to the facility’s energy and heating needs by 2025.Watch the video of the project here: https://youtu.be/Fvrsn3xpcwECONTACT DETAILS VGPInvestor Relations Tel: +32 (0)3 289 1433investor.relations@vgpparks.eu Karen HuybrechtsHead of Marketing Tel: +32 (0)3 289 1432CONTACT DETAILS FOR MEDIA ENQUIRIESAnette Nachbar DirectorBrunswick Group Tel: +49 152 288 10363anachbar@brunswickgroup.comABOUT VGPVGP is a pan-European owner  manager and developer of high-quality logistics and semi-industrial properties as well as a provider of renewable energy solutions.

42420,EuroNext,Bing API,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/investing/stocks-shares/the-worlds-best-investors-shares-in-carrefour/,The world’s best investors are snapping up shares in this supermarket – buy now at bargain prices,French supermarket group Carrefour has been running hard to stand still for several years. Since chief executive Alexandre Bompard announced his original turnaround plan for the group  soon after his appointment in mid-2017  investors have suffered a 3pc ...,British owners of French shares  which can be bought through most UK brokers  do need to fill out the right documents to minimise the hit from dividend withholding taxes  but Carrefour’s forecast yield stands at 6.4pc.In addition to the chunky dividend  the company plans €700m of buybacks this year and has already reduced the share count by 17pc with repurchases since the start of 2021.And investors can expect big cash returns to keep coming.Management has promised 5pc-plus dividend increases out to 2026 and further annual buybacks. This is underpinned by a target to generate over €1.7bn annual free cash flow by 2026  which compares with forecasts of €1.5bn over the next 12 months. Key to hitting the target are planned cost reductions of €4bn between 2023 and 2026. Much will come from using the group’s size for better procurement  creating a leaner management and improving logistics.Scale has recently been boosted by the company’s first major French acquisition in 20 years: the soon-to-be-completed purchase of 175 Cora and Match branded stores for €1.1bn – equivalent to 4.2 times earnings before interest  tax  depreciation  and amortisation (Ebitda) if expected cost savings are achieved. Carrefour’s Brazilian operation also had a major boost from acquisitions in 2022 with the R$7bn (£1.0bn) purchase of Grupo Big.Efficiency is also being helped by Bompard’s strategy of operating more stores as franchises. In the company’s eight core territories  72pc of stores now operate under such agreements.Not all cost savings will flow to shareholders. Competition remains intense both at home and abroad and Carrefour is cutting prices to retain and win customers. This includes a target of 40pc own-label sales by 2026. The figure currently stands at 37pc  up from 25pc in 2018.Mr Bompard believes there are also opportunities to grow profits by opening more convenience and discount stores  boosting e-commerce  redeveloping properties  and through a joint venture with advertising giant Publicis to create marketing services based on customer data.After years of Carrefour’s shares going nowhere while fundamentals have improved  it is now priced so low that not much needs to go right for the stock to deliver. And should recent economic headwinds begin to ease  there could be significant upside.Questor says buyTicker: EURONEXT:CAShare price: €14.86Read the latest Questor column on telegraph.co.uk every Sunday  Monday  Tuesday  Wednesday and Thursday from 8pmRead Questor’s rules of investment before you follow our tips,positive,0.59,0.39,0.02,mixed,0.54,0.22,0.24,True,English,"['best investors', 'bargain prices', 'world', 'shares', 'supermarket', '€1.7bn annual free cash flow', 'first major French acquisition', 'big cash returns', 'most UK brokers', 'eight core territories', '40pc own-label sales', 'advertising giant Publicis', 'recent economic headwinds', 'dividend withholding taxes', '5pc-plus dividend increases', 'latest Questor column', 'R$7bn', 'annual buybacks', 'major boost', 'chunky dividend', 'French shares', 'Grupo Big', 'British owners', 'right documents', 'forecast yield', 'share count', 'next 12 months', 'cost reductions', 'cost savings', 'Brazilian operation', 'redeveloping properties', 'joint venture', 'marketing services', 'customer data', 'significant upside', 'Share price', 'telegraph.co', 'leaner management', 'Mr Bompard', 'discount stores', 'hit', 'Carrefour', '6.4pc', 'addition', 'company', '17pc', 'repurchases', 'start', 'investors', 'target', 'forecasts', 'group', 'size', 'procurement', 'logistics', 'Scale', '20 years', '175 Cora', 'Match', '4.2 times', 'earnings', 'interest', 'depreciation', 'amortisation', 'Ebitda', 'acquisitions', 'Efficiency', 'strategy', 'franchises', '72pc', 'agreements', 'shareholders', 'Competition', 'home', 'prices', 'customers', 'figure', '37pc', '25pc', 'opportunities', 'profits', 'convenience', 'e-commerce', 'fundamentals', 'stock', 'Ticker', 'EURONEXT', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', '8pm', 'rules', 'investment', 'tips']",2024-06-09,2024-06-09,telegraph.co.uk
42421,EuroNext,Bing API,https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/top-company-london-020923462.html,The Top Company in London,We recently compiled a list of the Top 50 Companies in London and in this article we will take a look at the top one. Global Economic Forecast: Emerging Markets Set to Dominate by 2050 According to a report by the IMF ,"We recently compiled a list of the Top 50 Companies in London and in this article we will take a look at the top one.Global Economic Forecast: Emerging Markets Set to Dominate by 2050According to a report by the IMF  The economy of the United Kingdom is anticipated to grow in 2024 and strengthen further in 2025. Growth in Q1 2024 was 0.6% quarter-on-quarter  signaling a stronger-than-expected recovery from the recession in the latter half of 2023  which resulted in a full-year growth of 0.1%. The real GDP is forecasted to grow at 0.7% in 2024  compared to the previous estimate of 0.5% in April. The growth is expected to rise to 1.5% in 2025 as disinflation will boost real incomes and financial conditions will ease. However  longer-term growth prospects remain subdued due to weak labor productivity  despite higher migration numbers. Companies in the United Kingdom stand to benefit significantly from the projected economic recovery and growth in the coming years  as businesses in the United Kingdom are well-positioned to capitalize on this positive momentum. The forecasted real GDP growth and the return to the Bank of England's 2% inflation target by early 2025 will likely lead to more stable financial conditions and improved consumer confidence. Moreover  the disinflation trend  could increase consumer spending  and provide a boost to retail and service-oriented businesses. Additionally  the easing of financial conditions as the Bank of England potentially lowers interest rates could reduce borrowing costs for companies  enabling more investment in innovation  expansion  and job creation. London is the economic and financial powerhouse of the United Kingdom and plays a pivotal role in the nation's financial and economic landscape. London hosts the headquarters of numerous multinational corporations  banks  and financial institutions  making it a crucial hub for internationally. London’s financial district is home to the top companies in the United Kingdom  plays a significant role in the economy  and generates substantial revenue and employment  contributing significantly to the United Kingdom’s GDP.Story continuesTop Companies Shaping United Kingdom’s EconomySome of the top companies headquartered in London include Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) and HSBC Holdings PLC (NYSE:HSBC).ADVERTISEMENTShell plc (NYSE:SHEL) is a British multinational oil and gas company headquartered in London and is listed on the London Stock Exchange  Euronext Amsterdam  and the New York Stock Exchange.
