The primary objective of the study is to assess improvements in muscle strength of lower limbs as measured by knee extension. Multiple secondary endpoints will also be explored such as mobility (as measured by the 6-minute walk test) and body composition (fat mass  lean body mass). This placebo-controlled multicenter international study is expected to start mid-2024  following regulatory approval to be received from the FDA no sooner than 30 days after the filing  with first patients expected to be treated in the second half of 2024.
