It has since been widely shared by conservatives and right-wing economists  who have long been highly critical of the coalition’s policies.Weimer criticized Scholz’s deputy  Economy Minister Robert Habeck  with whom he said he had held 18 meetings  calling him a “sheer catastrophe.”“What kind of government are you actually running?” Weimer decried.According to the chief executive  international investment was only flowing into German companies because they were so undervalued. “We’ve become a junk shop ” he argued.Weimer also blasted the government for “destroying” the country’s vital auto industry  pointing to the planned phase-out of petrol and diesel cars.When asked by the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party’s Jurij Kofner  who was present at the event  whether the rise of the hard right was impacting business confidence  Weimer responded: “The fact that there are right-wing populists is not an issue for us professionals at the moment.”Germany’s ruling coalition was soundly beaten by opposition parties in Sunday’s vote for the EU Parliament  coming in behind the conservatives and the right-wing AfD  according to exit polls.Scholz’s center-left Social Democrats (SPD) received around 14% of the vote  down from 15.8% in 2019  marking their worst result in decades. The conservative center-right main opposition  the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the Christian Social Union (CSU)  is predicted to take first place with around 30%.

The Adagio franchise network has quadrupled in 6 years  going from 5 franchised aparthotels in 2018 to 28 today  i.e.  nearly 20% of the sites operated under the Adagio brand. A fourth opening will take place this year  this time in Master Franchise  with the Adagio Original Abidjan Marcory  the group's first site to open its doors in sub-Saharan Africa.The development of the franchise is proof that the aparthotel concept defended by Adagio has found its place in the hospitality offering. Indeed  the Adagio brand and the tools that allow franchisees to be its ambassadors are attracting more and more partners in the sector wishing to expand their hotel portfolio and their activities in an agile manner. Resulting in Adagio receiving many expressions of interest from potential partners during the last International Hospitality Investment Forum (IHIF) which was held in Berlin from 15th – 17th April  and during the congress of the Accor Franchise Association (AFA)  which took place last March in Antibes.The development of franchising constitutes one of the axes of the Next Adagio strategic plan: in the coming years  2/3 of openings  both in France and abroad  will be carried out using this model  with the objective to reach a percentage of franchises of 35% before 2030.For this  Adagio will be able to rely on the Accor group  a 50% shareholder  which benefits from a Master Franchise partnership strengthening the growth of the Adagio network beyond its geographical zones  particularly in more distant locations: sub-Saharan Africa  the Middle East or Asia. This mode of operation will in particular make it possible to create a “combo” offer bringing together two brands (Adagio and another brand from the Accor group) within the same walls  allowing the manager to mutualize areas dedicated to customers or to technical facilities  and to optimise costs.The strategy of using franchising as a growth driver consolidates Adagio's economic model; and the balance between the various modes of operation ensures at the same time rigorous management of the brand  the development of innovative concepts like the coliving offer tested in Adagio Original Paris Bercy and soon deployed in Adagio Original London Whitechapel (both directly operated by Adagio)  the permanent transmission of knowledge and also faster development of the number of sites under the Adagio brand  thanks to the help of partners.Adagio is experiencing rapid development. Franchise development  which meets the expectations of many real estate owners  is one of the drivers of this growth. By developing franchising  Adagio is strengthening its position as the European leader in aparthotels. Xavier Desaulles  CEO of AdagioI'm very excited to be working with Adagio on our mixed-use hotel and residence project. It's a brand with a strong reputation in the fast-growing aparthotels sector  and one that knows how to add value thanks to its strengths and appeal.

WWF is a global leader in building a sustainable future for people and the planet.Under the three-year agreement  from 2024 to 2027  WWF France will provide technical expertise to Novotel  helping its 580 hotels worldwide to have a positive impact on the ocean  challenging and guiding the brand and its properties throughout many aspects of its operations. The partnership will also see Novotel sponsoring several critical WWF ocean-related conservation projects across the world.Balance has long been at the core of the Novotel brand  both in its business fundamentals and in its commitments to the work-life experience of its guests. The brand’s focus on the ocean  the world’s biggest carbon sink and greatest source of planetary balance  which regulates the climate and protects habitats and wildlife  is a continuation of this purposeful commitment to balance.Novotel will build a three-year science-based action plan  rooted in three of the United Nations’ priority ocean-related actions  namely: reducing marine pollution and ocean acidification  particularly from land-based activities; fighting overfishing and promoting sustainable fishing models; and increasing scientific knowledge and research for ocean health.Mapped against these priorities  the Novotel action plan will aim to rebalance its impact on the planet  determining short and long-term initiatives across four pillars which form Novotel’s Positive Impact Plan:Reduce plastic  water & carbon footprint impact – empowering Novotel hotels to deliver positive impact action plans to reduce pressure on natural resources  with a strong focus on plastic  water & energy usage; Make sustainable food choices – reducing meat  fish and waste within Novotel’s food and beverage operations  and further development of sustainable seafood policies; Enhance education & ocean awareness – educating guests  hotel teams and local communities on the necessity of ocean conservation and how to positively contribute; Contribute to research & innovation – partnering with NGOs and investing in sustainable innovation.The partnership with WWF will help Novotel drive operational change and action for the greater good of the ocean and deliver upon its Positive Impact Plan.With a specific focus on the ocean  the WWF partnership has four main objectives:Work on sustainable seafood policies and supply chains for Novotel hotels and restaurantsRaise guests’ and employees’ awareness of the importance of the world’s oceansAdvocate for ocean preservation to inspire industry and policy makersPreserve and restore marine biodiversity through support of five WWF flagship projects around the worldTo inform Novotel’s work  WWF is conducting extensive site visits to Novotel hotels to understand property-level operations and practices  assess procurement data and make recommendations. WWF will provide a dedicated steering committee to assess Novotel’s progress on its commitments throughout the partnership.The partnership will see Novotel supporting essential WWF France conservation projects around the world  including:The protection of Posidonia   an endemic flowering plant of the Mediterranean which plays a key role as a carbon sink – removing carbon from the atmosphere - and provides benefits to 25 different marine ecosystems.  an endemic flowering plant of the Mediterranean which plays a key role as a carbon sink – removing carbon from the atmosphere - and provides benefits to 25 different marine ecosystems.

Fighting illegal  unreported and unregulated fishing will help protect leatherback turtles breeding on coastal areas of the Guianas  and green and olive ridley turtles from Brazil to Venezuela.We are delighted to announce that Novotel is embarking on an exciting new chapter. Novotel  Accor’s founding brand  is a powerful brand  leading the Midscale segment in most of the world. Today  we are starting a bold new ambition  championing a sustainability cause globally.Novotel has a long-standing commitment to innovation and balance  and we now take that commitment further  by choosing to help the greatest source of balance on our planet – the ocean.To make this ambition a reality  we are proud to unveil a groundbreaking partnership with the WWF - the World Wide Fund for Nature. Together with our partners  teams and guests  Novotel will lead the charge toward a sustainable future for our oceans  pioneering a new era of environmental stewardship in our hotels and driving industry change.There is a deep imbalance in the way the ocean is treated. Globally  over-exploitation and pollution are depleting the ocean's resources  while only a tiny fraction of climate finance is allocated to its preservation.

As growing landfills continue to elevate carbon emissions and pollute our air  soil and water  it's imperative that leaders in the built environment innovate sustainable solutions for managing construction waste.Exclusive partnership leverages the root structure of mushrooms to break down construction waste.Announced today  Tarkett has formed a partnership with Mycocycle”a Chicago -based  nature-inspired biotech startup that leverages the root structure of mushrooms to break down construction waste. Through Mycocycle's research and development  mycelia (fungal root structures) have been shown to consume and eliminate toxins from construction waste  producing a natural byproduct that makes an ideal raw material for the built environment and reduces our reliance on virgin raw materials.""This partnership is rooted in a shared investment in the exponential power of collaboration and innovation "" said Eric Daliere   CEO of Tarkett North America. ""Together  we share a commitment to creating a circular economy that protects our natural resources  promotes climate health and sustains every living thing.""Through this exclusive partnership  Tarkett will work collaboratively with Mycocycle by investing in ongoing research and development. By joining forces  the companies will leverage Tarkett's well-established ReStart take-back and recycling program as they operationalize alternative waste handling processes that return old flooring to a circular ecosystem. The partners will further test the effects of mycelium on all types of flooring collected through ReStart and explore the resulting byproduct as a central ingredient in new flooring products.""Because of its legacy and reputation for transparency  its respect for the importance of third-party verification  and its willingness to invest in innovation  it was clear to me that Tarkett walks the talk. That was important to me "" Mycocyle Founder Joanne Rodriguez said. ""My passion for this work”to remediate waste using Mother Nature's tools”met its match in Tarkett and its people. They are all serious about sustainability and saving our planet.""Last year in North America alone  Tarkett successfully diverted an estimated 1.5 million pounds (690 t) of post-use flooring to recycling  both in house and with external recycling partners. Through its partnership with Mycocycle and other innovative strategies  the company is on track to at least double that number in 2024.A Partnership for Our Shared FutureThe partnership between Tarkett and Mycocycle provides a new path to a circular economy by reducing waste  preserving virgin resources  and transforming old flooring into new biobased material.""From this moment forward  we'll never aim for anything less than zero waste "" said Roxane Spears   vice president of sustainability for Tarkett North America. ""Collaborating with like-minded people working toward the same goal is the only way our world is going to solve global sustainability issues. This revolutionary partnership could change the game for commercial flooring waste handling for the entire industry  not to mention the planet. This is the future. The future is fungi.""To follow along with Tarkett's progress  visit commercial.tarkett.com/restart/innovation.About TarkettWith a 140-year history  Tarkett is a worldwide leader in innovative and durable flooring and sports surface solutions  generating net sales of 3.4 billion euros in 2023.

Today  generative AI answers users' problems on specialized topics  offering invaluable support even in complex environments. But the benefits of generative AI extend far beyond just producing well-written content.

Since 2015  Sidetrade has built the most advanced and vast dataset in the Order-to-Cash market  and the only one offering real time AI capabilities. Continuously learning from Sidetrade’s extensive Data Lake   Aimie has been able to recommend optimal collection strategy and act by her own on certain actions. Now  Sidetrade has integrated a new range of data science techniques with the development of its own generative architecture which integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) that are being trained on vast amounts of O2C text data to understand and generate complex human language specific to the industry.These latest technologies enable Aimie to analyze and understand natural language queries  generate relevant answers  and assist users in anticipating future payment behaviors based on emerging trends and current data. Aimie also leverages big data elements to process and analyze large quantities of Data Lake information  elevating its capability to deliver relevant  accurate  contextualized O2C specific insights that no other vendor can provide.Mark Sheldon  Chief Technology Officer at Sidetrade: “With the O2C industry’s most advanced and only real time Data Lake  Sidetrade is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the potential of generative AI because without data  there is no advanced AI. Sidetrade offers unparalleled insights to customers worldwide  empowering finance professionals to benefit from GenAI. This leads to strategic business growth and operational efficiency in ways previously unattainable. Generative AI places humans back at the heart of processes  without sacrificing performance objectives.”Ensuring data privacy and customization with in-house innovation of LLMsThe advantage of running Sidetrade’s own generative architecture with domain expert LLMs  over generic  third-party hosted LLMs  is that Aimie provides insights that are far more tailored and specific to the O2C industry. Unlike GenAI features on the market that offer much more generalist information  Sidetrade’s AI delivers precision and relevance.Moreover  unlike other SaaS offerings  all of Sidetrade’s infrastructure  LLMs  and data remain within Sidetrade’s private cloud. This ensures that customer data is fully segregated and never mixed in with external models  prioritizing privacy and security.Sheldon continued: “Sidetrade’s approach to generative AI ensures that our technology upholds the highest standards of privacy  sovereignty  and accuracy. Instead of adopting a plug-and-play approach  we have built an entire ecosystem in-house  taking full ownership of the intellectual property. This strategy offers a whole host of benefits to our customers  both now and in the future  including a more bespoke  customized and accurate service. Additionally  it provides the reassurance that their data never leaves our secure cloud environment.”Investor relationsChristelle Dhrif 00 33 6 10 46 72 00 cdhrif@sidetrade.comMedia relationsBecca Parlby 00 44 7824 5055 84 bparlby@sidetrade.comAbout Sidetrade ( www.sidetrade.com )Sidetrade (Euronext Growth: ALBFR.PA) provides a SaaS platform dedicated to securing and accelerating cash flow.

Iqirvo may be prescribed immediately in the U.S. for eligible patients.This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on reduction of alkaline phosphatase (ALP). Improvement in survival or prevention of liver decompensation events have not been demonstrated. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trial(s). Iqirvo is not recommended for people who have or develop decompensated cirrhosis (e.g.  ascites  variceal bleeding  hepatic encephalopathy).“For a significant number of people living with PBC  available treatments do not control the condition and may exacerbate symptoms of PBC. Left unmanaged  PBC can progress  leading to liver failure and in some cases  the need for a liver transplant ” said Christelle Huguet  Executive Vice President  Head of Research and Development at Ipsen. “Iqirvo demonstrated statistically significant improvements in biochemical response compared to UDCA alone. Iqirvo is therefore a much-needed treatment option and the first new medicine for PBC in nearly a decade.”Iqirvo is a first-in-class oral  once-daily peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonist. Iqirvo was in-licensed from GENFIT in 2021. The accelerated approval of Iqirvo is based on data from the Phase III ELATIVE trial published in the New England Journal of Medicine1. The ELATIVE trial demonstrated that 13 times more patients achieved the composite primary endpoint of biochemical response when treated with Iqirvo plus UDCA (n=108) versus placebo plus UDCA (=53) (respectively 51% versus 4% for a 47% treatment difference). ALP is a biochemical marker and is used as a surrogate endpoint in PBC trials. Secondary endpoints showed normalization in ALP levels in only Iqirvo-treated patients (15% for Iqirvo plus UDCA (n=108) versus 0% for placebo plus UDCA (n=53)). Most patients (95%) received study treatment (Iqirvo or placebo) in combination with UDCA.The most common adverse reactions with Iqirvo reported in ≥10% of study participants were weight gain  abdominal pain  diarrhea  nausea and vomiting. Some study participants treated with Iqirvo experienced myalgia  myopathy and rhabdomyolysis; fractures; adverse effects on fetal and newborn development; drug-induced liver injury; hypersensitivity reactions; or biliary obstruction. See full Important Safety Information below.“Data from the pivotal Phase III ELATIVE clinical trial demonstrated that Iqirvo is an effective second-line treatment for patients with PBC with favorable benefit and risk data ” said Dr. Kris Kowdley  Director at Liver Institute Northwest  Washington and a primary investigator on the ELATIVE study. “The approval of Iqirvo will allow healthcare providers in the U.S. to address an unmet need with the potential to significantly reduce ALP levels for our patients with PBC.”PBC is a rare  autoimmune  cholestatic liver disease where a build-up of bile and toxins (cholestasis) and chronic inflammation causes irreversible fibrosis (scarring) of the liver and destruction of the bile ducts. Impacting approximately 100 000 people in the U.S.2  the majority being women  PBC is a lifelong condition that can worsen over time if not effectively treated  leading to liver transplant and in some cases  premature death. PBC also affects day-to-day life  with people most commonly experiencing severe fatigue symptoms and debilitating itch (pruritus).“People living with PBC can feel like the symptoms they experience are dismissed by family members  friends or even their doctors  because they have not experienced something similarly disruptive in their lives. People with PBC may also feel uncertainty around the disease progression and if  or when  their liver health may deteriorate ” said Carol Roberts  Executive President of PBCers  a patient advocacy organization in the U.S. providing support to people living with PBC. “Earlier diagnosis and education about PBC  along with new treatment options are important to meet the current needs of people living with PBC.”Iqirvo has been submitted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)  seeking authorization for PBC  with final EMA and MHRA regulatory decisions anticipated in the second half of 2024. The FDA approval of Iqirvo further strengthens Ipsen’s portfolio of treatments for rare cholestatic liver diseases available to patients in the U.S. This includes our FDA approved medicine for the treatment of pruritus in patients three months and older with progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC) and for the treatment of cholestatic pruritus in patients from 12 months of age with Alagille syndrome (ALGS).IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONMyalgia  Myopathy  and Rhabdomyolysis: Rhabdomyolysis resulting in acute kidney injury occurred in one IQIRVO-treated patient who had cirrhosis at baseline and was also taking a stable dose of an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (statin). Myalgia or myopathy  with or without CPK elevations  occurred in patients treated with IQIRVO alone or treated concomitantly with a stable dose of an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor. Assess for myalgia and myopathy prior to IQIRVO initiation. Consider periodic assessment (clinical exam  CPK measurement) during treatment with IQIRVO  especially in those who have signs and symptoms of new onset or worsening of muscle pain or myopathy. Interrupt IQIRVO treatment if there is new onset or worsening of muscle pain  or myopathy  or rhabdomyolysis.Fractures: Fractures occurred in 7% of IQIRVO-treated patients compared to no placebo-treated patients. Consider the risk of fracture in the care of patients treated with IQIRVO and monitor bone health according to current standards of care.Adverse Effects on Fetal and Newborn Development: IQIRVO may cause fetal harm when administered during pregnancy. For females of reproductive potential  verify that the patient is not pregnant prior to initiation of therapy. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective non-hormonal contraceptives or add a barrier method when using systemic hormonal contraceptives during treatment with IQIRVO and for 3 weeks following the last dose of IQIRVO.Drug-Induced Liver Injury: Suspected drug-induced liver injury occurred in one patient who took IQIRVO 80 mg once daily and two patients who took IQIRVO at 1.5-times the recommended dosage  of which one presented with autoimmune-like hepatitis. The median time to onset of elevation in liver tests was 85 days. Obtain baseline clinical  laboratory and imaging assessments at treatment initiation with IQIRVO and monitor thereafter according to routine patient management. Interrupt IQIRVO treatment if liver tests (ALT  AST  total bilirubin [TB]  and/or alkaline phosphatase [ALP]) worsen  or the patient develops signs and symptoms consistent with clinical hepatitis (e.g.  jaundice  right upper quadrant pain  eosinophilia). Consider permanent discontinuation if liver tests worsen after restarting IQIRVO.Hypersensitivity Reactions: Hypersensitivity reactions have occurred in a clinical trial with IQIRVO at 1.5-times the recommended dosage. Three patients (0.2%) had rash or unspecified allergic reaction that occurred 2 to 30 days after IQIRVO initiation. Hypersensitivity reactions resolved after discontinuation of IQIRVO and treatment with steroids and/or antihistamines. If a severe hypersensitivity reaction occurs  permanently discontinue IQIRVO. If a mild or moderate hypersensitivity reaction occurs  interrupt IQIRVO and treat promptly. Monitor the patient until signs and symptoms resolve. If a hypersensitivity reaction recurs after IQIRVO rechallenge  then permanently discontinue IQIRVO.Biliary Obstruction: Avoid use of IQIRVO in patients with complete biliary obstruction. If biliary obstruction is suspected  interrupt IQIRVO and treat as clinically indicated.Drug-Drug InteractionsIQIRVO may reduce the systemic exposure of progestin and ethinyl estradiol (CYP3A4 substrates)  which may lead to contraceptive failure and/or an increase in breakthrough bleeding. Switch to effective non-hormonal contraceptives or add a barrier method when using hormonal contraceptives during treatment with IQIRVO and for at least 3 weeks after last dose.CPK elevation and/or myalgia occurred in patients on IQIRVO monotherapy. Co-administration of IQIRVO and HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors can increase the risk of myopathy. Monitor for signs and symptoms of muscle injury. Consider periodic assessment (clinical exam  CPK) during treatment. Interrupt IQIRVO treatment if there is new onset or worsening of muscle pain or myopathy.Co-administration of IQIRVO with rifampin  an inducer of metabolizing enzymes  may reduce the systemic exposure of elafibranor resulting in delayed or suboptimal biochemical response. Monitor the biochemical response (e.g.  ALP and bilirubin) when patients initiate rifampin during treatment with IQIRVO.Bile acid sequestrants may interfere with IQIRVO absorption and systemic exposure  which may reduce efficacy. Administer IQIRVO at least 4 hours before or after a bile acid sequestrant  or at as great an interval as possible.Use in Special PopulationsPregnancy: Based on data from animal reproduction studies  IQIRVO may cause fetal harm when administered during pregnancy. There are insufficient data from human pregnancies exposed to IQIRVO to allow an assessment of a drug-associated risk of major birth defects  miscarriage  or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Report pregnancies to Ipsen Pharmaceuticals  Inc. Adverse Event reporting line at 1-855-463-5127 or https://www.ipsen.com/contact-us/.Lactation: There are no data available on the presence of IQIRVO or its metabolites in human milk  or on effects of the drug on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production. IQIRVO is not recommended during breastfeeding and for at least 3 weeks following last dose of IQIRVO because the risk to breastfed child cannot be excluded.Females and Males of Reproductive Potential: IQIRVO may cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating IQIRVO. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with IQIRVO and for 3 weeks after the final dose.The most common adverse events occurring in ≥10% of patients were weight gain (23%)  abdominal pain (11%)  nausea (11%)  vomiting (11%)  and diarrhea (11%).You are encouraged to report side effects to FDA at (800) FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. You may also report side effects to Ipsen Pharmaceuticals at 1-855-463-5127.Please see full Prescribing Information for IQIRVO.About IqirvoIqirvo (pronounced EYE-KER-VO) is an oral  once-daily  peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonist indicated for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) in combination with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in adults who have an inadequate response to UDCA  or as monotherapy in patients unable to tolerate UDCA. While the mechanism is not well understood  pharmacological activity that is potentially relevant to Iqirvo therapeutic effects includes inhibition of bile acid synthesis through activation of PPAR-alpha and PPAR-delta. In 2019  Iqirvo was granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in adults with PBC who have an inadequate response to ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) the existing first-line therapy for PBC. Iqirvo has not received approval by regulatory authorities outside of the U.S. Iqirvo is currently under regulatory review with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). Iqirvo was discovered and developed by GENFIT and Ipsen licensed the exclusive worldwide rights (except China  Hong Kong  Taiwan and Macau) to elafibranor from GENFIT in 2021.Iqirvo has been granted approval under the FDA accelerated approval program  which allows for approval of medicines that treat serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need based on a surrogate endpoint. Under the program  Ipsen is required to conduct a trial to confirm anticipated clinical benefit. The confirmatory trial for Iqirvo  ELFIDENCE  is ongoing.Iqirvo is an 80 mg tablet administered orally once daily. To ensure access to Iqirvo for eligible individuals in the U.S.  the IPSEN CARES® patient support program is available as a resource to people living with PBC and their caregivers to provide educational support and address coverage  access and reimbursement questions (1-866-435-5677).About the Phase III ELATIVE trialELATIVE is a multi-center  randomized double-blind  placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trial (n=161) that evaluated the efficacy and safety of Iqirvo 80mg once daily plus UDCA (n=108) versus placebo plus UDCA (n=53). Iqirvo or placebo was administered in combination with UDCA in 95% of patients and as monotherapy in 5% of patients who were unable to tolerate UDCA. The 52-week study was completed by 92% of participants with 97% of those who completed the study continuing in an extension study. The results were published in the New England Journal of Medicine1.The ELATIVE trial demonstrated that Iqirvo had a statistically significant treatment benefit with 51% of patients on Iqirvo achieving a biochemical response compared with 4% on the placebo arm  a treatment benefit of 47% (95% CI 32  57; p<0.0001). Biochemical response was defined as ALP less than 1.67 Upper Limit of Normal (ULN)  an ALP decrease of greater than or equal to 15% from baseline and total bilirubin (TB) ≤ ULN at week 52.ALP normalization at week 52 was a key secondary endpoint with 15% of Iqirvo-treated patients demonstrating normalization versus 0% placebo (p=0.002).The significant biochemical response to Iqirvo was further supported by data demonstrating reductions from baseline in ALP levels were sustained through week 52 and response was rapid  seen as early as Week 4 in the Iqirvo group.The most common adverse reactions with Iqirvo reported in ≥10% of study participants were weight gain  abdominal pain  diarrhea  nausea and vomiting.ENDSAbout IpsenWe are a global biopharmaceutical company with a focus on bringing transformative medicines to patients in three therapeutic areas: Oncology  Rare Disease and Neuroscience.Our pipeline is fueled by external innovation and supported by nearly 100 years of development experience and global hubs in the U.S.  France and the U.K. Our teams in more than 40 countries and our partnerships around the world enable us to bring medicines to patients in more than 80 countries.Ipsen is listed in Paris (Euronext: IPN) and in the U.S. through a Sponsored Level I American Depositary Receipt program (ADR: IPSEY).

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements.

There are insufficient data from human pregnancies exposed to IQIRVO to allow an assessment of a drug-associated risk of major birth defects  miscarriage  or other adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Report pregnancies to Ipsen Pharmaceuticals  Inc. Adverse Event reporting line at 1-855-463-5127 or https://www.ipsen.com/contact-us/.Lactation: There are no data available on the presence of IQIRVO or its metabolites in human milk  or on effects of the drug on the breastfed infant or the effects on milk production. IQIRVO is not recommended during breastfeeding and for at least 3 weeks following last dose of IQIRVO because the risk to breastfed child cannot be excluded.Females and Males of Reproductive Potential: IQIRVO may cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women. Verify the pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential prior to initiating IQIRVO. Advise females of reproductive potential to use effective contraception during treatment with IQIRVO and for 3 weeks after the final dose.The most common adverse events occurring in ≥10% of patients were weight gain (23%)  abdominal pain (11%)  nausea (11%)  vomiting (11%)  and diarrhea (11%).You are encouraged to report side effects to FDA at (800) FDA-1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch. You may also report side effects to Ipsen Pharmaceuticals at 1-855-463-5127.Please see full Prescribing Information for IQIRVO.About IqirvoIqirvo (pronounced EYE-KER-VO) is an oral  once-daily  peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonist indicated for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) in combination with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in adults who have an inadequate response to UDCA  or as monotherapy in patients unable to tolerate UDCA. While the mechanism is not well understood  pharmacological activity that is potentially relevant to Iqirvo therapeutic effects includes inhibition of bile acid synthesis through activation of PPAR-alpha and PPAR-delta. In 2019  Iqirvo was granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in adults with PBC who have an inadequate response to ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) the existing first-line therapy for PBC. Iqirvo has not received approval by regulatory authorities outside of the U.S. Iqirvo is currently under regulatory review with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). Iqirvo was discovered and developed by GENFIT and Ipsen licensed the exclusive worldwide rights (except China  Hong Kong  Taiwan and Macau) to elafibranor from GENFIT in 2021.Iqirvo has been granted approval under the FDA accelerated approval program  which allows for approval of medicines that treat serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need based on a surrogate endpoint. Under the program  Ipsen is required to conduct a trial to confirm anticipated clinical benefit. The confirmatory trial for Iqirvo  ELFIDENCE  is ongoing.Iqirvo is an 80 mg tablet administered orally once daily. To ensure access to Iqirvo for eligible individuals in the U.S.  the IPSEN CARES® patient support program is available as a resource to people living with PBC and their caregivers to provide educational support and address coverage  access and reimbursement questions (1-866-435-5677).About the Phase III ELATIVE trialELATIVE is a multi-center  randomized double-blind  placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trial (n=161) that evaluated the efficacy and safety of Iqirvo 80mg once daily plus UDCA (n=108) versus placebo plus UDCA (n=53). Iqirvo or placebo was administered in combination with UDCA in 95% of patients and as monotherapy in 5% of patients who were unable to tolerate UDCA. The 52-week study was completed by 92% of participants with 97% of those who completed the study continuing in an extension study. The results were published in the New England Journal of Medicine1.The ELATIVE trial demonstrated that Iqirvo had a statistically significant treatment benefit with 51% of patients on Iqirvo achieving a biochemical response compared with 4% on the placebo arm  a treatment benefit of 47% (95% CI 32  57; p<0.0001). Biochemical response was defined as ALP less than 1.67 Upper Limit of Normal (ULN)  an ALP decrease of greater than or equal to 15% from baseline and total bilirubin (TB) ≤ ULN at week 52.ALP normalization at week 52 was a key secondary endpoint with 15% of Iqirvo-treated patients demonstrating normalization versus 0% placebo (p=0.002).The significant biochemical response to Iqirvo was further supported by data demonstrating reductions from baseline in ALP levels were sustained through week 52 and response was rapid  seen as early as Week 4 in the Iqirvo group.The most common adverse reactions with Iqirvo reported in ≥10% of study participants were weight gain  abdominal pain  diarrhea  nausea and vomiting.ENDSAbout IpsenWe are a global biopharmaceutical company with a focus on bringing transformative medicines to patients in three therapeutic areas: Oncology  Rare Disease and Neuroscience.Our pipeline is fueled by external innovation and supported by nearly 100 years of development experience and global hubs in the U.S.  France and the U.K. Our teams in more than 40 countries and our partnerships around the world enable us to bring medicines to patients in more than 80 countries.Ipsen is listed in Paris (Euronext: IPN) and in the U.S. through a Sponsored Level I American Depositary Receipt program (ADR: IPSEY).

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law.

42502,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.irishtimes.com/business/markets/2024/06/10/irelands-stock-exchange-needs-support/,Ireland’s stock exchange is in trouble and needs our help,State needs to incentivise public equity investment as paucity of new listings a cause for concern for wider economy,With just 31 listed companies  compared with 100 in 1999  the paucity of new listings on Euronext Dublin is a cause for concern. Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillFlutter’s recent decision to move its primary listing to the United States  with the possible spectre of Smurfit Kappa following shortly  brings the future of the Irish equity market back into sharp focus.There are currently just 31 listed companies on Euronext Dublin  a sharp decline relative to 100 back in 1999. While market departures are part of equity markets  the paucity of new listings is an ominous sign for the Irish market and a real cause for concern.Over the last decade  many high-potential Irish companies have bypassed public equity funding in favour of trade sales to international investors  which often can be a missed opportunity for Ireland Inc.A stock-market listing is often the final step on the funding escalator for a high-potential company. It can act as a critical conduit for domestic entrepreneurs to scale their business while also retaining strategic and operational control.READ MOREIt can also ensure a greater proportion of the intellectual property and wealth created by Irish entrepreneurs stays in the domestic economy. The benefits that accrue to the State from supporting such companies stretch well beyond higher taxation receipts and increased employment.Supporting the growth of scaling Irish companies can bring greater balance to domestic industrial policy. An overreliance on foreign multinationals  which contribute an estimated 80 per cent of corporation tax receipts and in the region of 40 per cent of all income tax  has long been cited as a key risk to the domestic economy. The best counterbalance to boost economic resilience and broaden the tax base comes through creating an environment for an innovative and competitive indigenous industry to thrive.More particularly  it nurtures businesses that have an ability to scale and become global leaders in their respective industries as the likes of Kerry Group  CRH and Kingspan have done before them.Irish companies that have scaled through the public equity markets can and do play a crucial role in addressing the State’s infrastructure deficits. Cairn Homes and Glenveagh will have a central role to play if the State is to get to its 50 000-unit run rate of new homes annually  which in turn will be important in ensuring the State can continue to attract inflows of foreign direct investment.Clearly  the travails of our domestic equity market aren’t a uniquely Irish phenomenon but a microcosm of a wider European issue. The EU 27′s stock-market capitalisation today is roughly equivalent to the US’s ‘Magnificent Seven’ technology companiesFurthermore  Ireland’s 2030 renewable energy targets are unlikely to achieved without a sizeable contribution from Greencoat Renewables  the largest operator of wind assets in Ireland. These names represent just a sample of the companies that provide critical services for Ireland Inc and for whom public equity market funding has been central to their success.Clearly  the travails of our domestic equity market aren’t a uniquely Irish phenomenon but a microcosm of a wider European issue. The EU 27′s stock-market capitalisation today is roughly equivalent to the US’s “Magnificent Seven″ technology companies. In fact  the European Investment Bank has noted that a lack of financing for equity growth is among the biggest reasons for the scarcity of big new innovators in the EU  especially in the digital and technological sectors.Paradoxically  despite a clear requirement for equity financing  a recent study by the Association of Financial Markets for Europe noted that  over the past three years  the region’s corporates accounted for just 7 per cent of new stock-market listings globally  a paltry percentage given the region’s scale in the global economy.Among the central aims of the EU capital markets union (CMU) is to entice more people to invest in companies within the euro zone which  in turn  should benefit from lower and more diversified funding streams. This could assist in the creation and scaling of high-potential companies vital for increasing the competitiveness of the Irish and broader European economy.Unfortunately  it has been almost a decade since CMU was first mooted and several hurdles remain to be overcome if it is to fully come to fruition. Some useful initiatives have been adopted at a supernational level  including the European Listing Act  which will make public capital markets more attractive particularly for small and medium-sized companies. However  it will certainly need to be supplemented by policy actions at national level.Many of our European brethren have taken proactive steps to help high-potential companies thrive on the equity capital markets. The French Tibi initiative  launched in 2019  has been successful in mobilising the savings of institutional investors to help it become the leading ecosystem for financing of new technologies in the EU. It has also supported the establishment of crossover funds that can fill a funding gap pre-IPO and supports companies at the early stages of their listing journey.This in time could help France emulate the success of Sweden  whose IPO count in the last decade not only far exceeded that of Ireland but also France  Germany  Spain and the Netherlands combined thanks to its deep pools of institutional and retail capital.Nurturing a strong retail investment culture has been central to Sweden’s success. This has been achieved not just by providing targeted education to boost financial literacy but also through the establishment of tax-advantaged investment-savings-accounts products as far back as 1984  versions of which have now been adopted in the likes of Italy  Britain and France. These schemes not only serve to boost investment and liquidity in the shares of high-potential scaling companies but can also generate attractive returns for investors.There is just over €136 billion sitting on deposit in Ireland  most of it earning a negligible return  some of which could clearly be put to more productive use for the benefit of both domestic companies and savers alike. A bold and creative initiative that would put excess savings to work in support of the next cadre of domestic champions could well pay dividends for Ireland Inc in the decades to come.John Mullane is chief investment officer of Cantor Fitzgerald Ireland,negative,0.18,0.11,0.71,mixed,0.31,0.21,0.48,True,English,"['stock exchange', 'Ireland', 'trouble', 'help', 'Dara Mac Dónaill', 'The French Tibi initiative', 'Magnificent Seven’ technology companies', 'Magnificent Seven″ technology companies', 'EU capital markets union', 'public equity market funding', 'many high-potential Irish companies', 'public capital markets', 'public equity funding', 'higher taxation receipts', 'competitive indigenous industry', '50,000-unit run rate', '2030 renewable energy targets', 'past three years', 'diversified funding streams', 'equity capital markets', 'public equity markets', 'wider European issue', 'European Investment Bank', 'foreign direct investment', 'corporation tax receipts', 'big new innovators', 'European Listing Act', 'domestic equity market', 'broader European economy', 'domestic industrial policy', 'Irish equity market', 'new stock-market listings', 'Irish market', 'funding escalator', 'market departures', 'Financial Markets', 'European brethren', 'domestic economy', 'high-potential companies', 'new listings', 'The EU', 'high-potential company', 'domestic entrepreneurs', 'foreign multinationals', 'policy actions', 'primary listing', 'income tax', 'tax base', 'new homes', 'new technologies', 'equity growth', 'stock-market capitalisation', 'global economy', '31 listed companies', 'medium-sized companies', 'Irish entrepreneurs', 'Irish phenomenon', 'equity financing', 'Euronext Dublin', 'recent decision', 'United States', 'possible spectre', 'Smurfit Kappa', 'sharp focus', 'sharp decline', 'ominous sign', 'trade sales', 'international investors', 'final step', 'critical conduit', 'operational control', 'READ MORE', 'greater proportion', 'intellectual property', 'greater balance', '80 per cent', '40 per cent', 'key risk', 'best counterbalance', 'economic resilience', 'global leaders', 'respective industries', 'Kerry Group', 'crucial role', 'infrastructure deficits', 'Cairn Homes', 'central role', 'sizeable contribution', 'Greencoat Renewables', 'largest operator', 'wind assets', 'critical services', 'biggest reasons', 'technological sectors', 'clear requirement', 'recent study', '7 per cent', 'paltry percentage', 'central aims', 'euro zone', 'several hurdles', 'useful initiatives', 'supernational level', 'proactive steps', 'institutional investors', 'leading ecosystem', 'crossover funds', 'real cause', 'last decade', 'Ireland Inc.', 'paucity', 'concern', 'Photograph', 'Flutter', 'future', 'favour', 'opportunity', 'business', 'strategic', 'wealth', 'benefits', 'employment', 'overreliance', 'region', 'environment', 'innovative', 'ability', 'likes', 'CRH', 'Kingspan', 'Glenveagh', 'turn', 'inflows', 'travails', 'microcosm', 'names', 'sample', 'success', 'fact', 'lack', 'scarcity', 'digital', 'Association', 'corporates', 'scale', 'CMU', 'people', 'lower', 'creation', 'scaling', 'competitiveness', 'fruition', 'small', 'savings', 'establishment']",2024-06-10,2024-06-11,irishtimes.com
