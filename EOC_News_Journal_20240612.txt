Never before ” he said.Weimer’s scathing remarks  made during a speech to Bavarian business leaders in April  have only recently surfaced  igniting a firestorm of reactions from both supporters and detractors. The CEO criticized the government’s economic policies  migration strategies  and alleged focus on “do-gooderism” over traditional German virtues of diligence and productivity.Germany’s economy has been struggling  with the country experiencing a recession last year and projected to be the slowest-growing major economy this year  expanding by just 0.2%. The German stock market is also facing challenges  with the Dax trading at a record 25% discount to the US S&P 500 and companies like Linde (Nasdaq: Lin) opting to relist in the US.Weimer’s comments have drawn mixed reactions from the business community and politicians. While some  like entrepreneur Sarna Roeser  agree with his sentiment  others  such as Verena Hubertz  an MP in the SPD  have dismissed the speech as “bizarre” and more suited to a “beer tent than Dax-listed company executive.”What’s clear is that Weimer’s speech comes amidst growing discontent among German voters  as evidenced by the coalition government’s poor performance in the European Parliament elections over the weekend.Information for this story was found via the sources and companies mentioned.

Speaking to the Bavarian business lobby group Wirtschaftsbeirat Bayern  Weimer expressed concerns over what he perceived as a lack of leadership from the ruling coalition  asserting that their policies were driving international investors away from Germany.In remarks made in April and recently brought to light by Wirtschaftsbeirat Bayern's social media post  Weimer painted a grim picture of Germany's reputation on the global stage  noting that it had never been as tarnished as it is currently. The speech  which has gained traction among conservative circles critical of the coalition's governance  highlighted Weimer's frustration with Deputy Economy Minister Robert Habeck  whom he labeled a ""sheer catastrophe.""Questioning the efficacy of the government's policies  Weimer lambasted its approach to economic management and criticized its impact on vital sectors such as the auto industry. He particularly lamented the planned phase-out of petrol and diesel cars  which he argued would have detrimental effects on the country's economic landscape.Weimer's assessment of Germany's economic situation resonated with concerns about the country's perceived decline in competitiveness and attractiveness to international investors. He highlighted the undervaluation of German companies as a factor attracting investment  characterizing the nation as a ""junk shop.""Despite questions raised about the influence of right-wing populism on business confidence  Weimer downplayed its significance  emphasizing that it was not a primary concern for professionals in the industry. However  his remarks underscored broader anxieties within Germany's business community about the country's economic direction and the government's ability to navigate challenges effectively.As Weimer's comments reverberate  they shed light on the growing discontent and skepticism surrounding Germany's economic prospects under the current leadership  prompting calls for greater accountability and decisive action to address pressing issues facing the nation's economy.MENAFN12062024000045015687ID1108324245",neutral,0.19,0.77,0.04,negative,0.02,0.22,0.76,True,English,"['Stock exchange director', 'developing country', 'Germany', 'Deputy Economy Minister Robert Habeck', 'Bavarian business lobby group', 'Chancellor Olaf Scholz', 'social media post', 'factor attracting investment', 'business confidence', 'business community', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'alarm bells', 'economic trajectory', 'Wirtschaftsbeirat Bayern', 'international investors', 'grim picture', 'global stage', 'conservative circles', 'economic management', 'vital sectors', 'diesel cars', 'detrimental effects', 'economic landscape', 'economic situation', 'German companies', 'junk shop', 'right-wing populism', 'primary concern', 'broader anxieties', 'economic direction', 'growing discontent', 'economic prospects', 'greater accountability', 'decisive action', 'pressing issues', 'ruling coalition', 'auto industry', 'current leadership', 'developing country', 'Theodor Weimer', 'MENAFN', 'CEO', 'Germany', 'status', 'concerns', 'lack', 'policies', 'remarks', 'April', 'light', 'reputation', 'speech', 'traction', 'governance', 'frustration', 'efficacy', 'government', 'approach', 'impact', 'phase-out', 'petrol', 'assessment', 'decline', 'competitiveness', 'attractiveness', 'undervaluation', 'questions', 'influence', 'significance', 'professionals', 'challenges', 'comments', 'skepticism', 'calls']",2024-06-12,2024-06-12,menafn.com

This startup is looking to help.,ElectronX has raised a $15 million seed round from investors led by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt’s venture-capital firm  Innovation Endeavors. The startup  which has previously kept out of the public eye  is set to announce the funding round later Wednesday.,"A startup is aiming to build a marketplace where companies can shield themselves from the wild price volatility associated with intermittent wind and solar power  along with extreme weather events such as the recent Texas heat waves.ElectronX has raised a $15 million seed round from investors led by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt’s venture-capital firm  Innovation Endeavors. The startup  which has previously kept out of the public eye  is set to announce the funding round later Wednesday.Based in Chicago  ElectronX is applying for a license from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to run a futures exchange. If approved  ElectronX would be taking on two large incumbents that already operate electricity futures markets: Intercontinental Exchange  or ICE  and Germany’s Deutsche Börse  which offers U.S. electricity futures through its Nodal Exchange unit.Electricity futures are financial contracts that allow traders to bet on swings in power prices. Businesses such as utilities can also use them to hedge against the risk of price volatility.ElectronX’s planned debut comes as the increasing use of cleaner energy sources has made it harder to forecast energy costs because of the intermittent nature of wind and solar power. Strong winds can send power prices plummeting while wind farms create a glut of electricity. The opposite might happen if the weather shifts. In 2023  a record 23% of U.S. electricity demand was supplied by renewable sources  according to BloombergNEF.“The grid transition has massively changed the power mix in the U.S.  and it’s caused a lot of intermittent stability issues "" said Sam Tegel  chief executive of ElectronX.Meanwhile  extreme weather events—which scientists expect to grow more frequent with climate change—are also roiling energy markets. A freak winter storm that left millions of Texas residents without electricity in February 2021 cost power companies more than $10 billion  according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. On the evening of May 8  wholesale electricity prices in the Dallas area skyrocketed to just under $5 000 per megawatt-hour from about $142 in two hours amid a heat wave and power-plant outages  according to data provider GridStatus.io.ElectronX’s first futures contracts will be tied to electricity prices in Texas  and it will eventually list contracts tied to power prices at locations nationwide  Tegel said.Unlike its larger rivals  ElectronX plans to offer contracts tied to the hourly price of electricity. The startup says its hourly contracts will allow customers to have a more fine-tuned hedging tool than they can find at ICE or Nodal Exchange  whose electricity futures are generally based on the average price of power over a full day or month.ElectronX says its target customers include generators of wind and solar power  operators of large-scale batteries  and data centers whose hunger for electricity is expected to grow as artificial-intelligence applications gobble up ever more energy.The startup aims to serve smaller customers as well as the institutional-size firms that trade on ICE and Nodal Exchange. Unlike the incumbents  ElectronX plans to offer direct access to its market without requiring customers to use brokers  known as futures commission merchants  that hold collateral for traders on traditional futures exchanges.The direct-access model could make it simpler for ElectronX to bring aboard new customers. But it also means that  at least initially  ElectronX won’t be able to offer leveraged trading  in which a trader uses a relatively small amount of money to place a large bet.ElectronX’s launch could still be many months away because of the time needed to win regulatory approval for its exchange and clearinghouse.The startup was founded in 2022 by Philip Krim  the former CEO of mattress seller Casper Sleep  who has since become a climate-tech investor  and former power trader Evan Caron. Tegel joined as CEO in 2023. A veteran of electronic trading  Tegel previously worked at high-speed trading firm Jump Trading and hedge fund Millennium Management.Innovation Endeavors said it put up $10 million for ElectronX’s funding round. Schmidt’s firm specializes in early-stage investments. It has previously placed bets on Uber Technologies and SoFi Technologies  and it describes climate as one of its focus areas.Schmidt  a founding partner of Innovation Endeavors  was CEO of Google from 2001 to 2011  before it was restructured and renamed Alphabet. During his time at the search giant  Google stepped up the use of renewable energy to power its data centers as part of an effort to become carbon-neutral.Write to Alexander Osipovich at alexo@wsj.com",neutral,0.27,0.61,0.12,negative,0.02,0.34,0.64,True,English,"['Wild weather', 'electricity prices', 'startup', 'S&P Global Market Intelligence', 'former Google CEO Eric Schmidt', 'recent Texas heat waves', 'U.S. electricity demand', 'Commodity Futures Trading Commission', 'U.S. electricity futures', 'futures commission merchants', 'Deutsche Börse', 'freak winter storm', 'tuned hedging tool', 'traditional futures exchanges', 'extreme weather events', '$15 million seed round', 'intermittent stability issues', 'wild price volatility', 'first futures contracts', 'high-speed trading firm', 'electricity futures markets', 'cleaner energy sources', 'wholesale electricity prices', 'Nodal Exchange unit', 'former power trader', 'two large incumbents', 'former CEO', 'leveraged trading', 'electronic trading', 'Jump Trading', 'renewable sources', 'energy markets', 'two hours', 'large bet', 'funding round', 'intermittent nature', 'Texas residents', 'hourly price', 'average price', 'power prices', 'solar power', 'venture-capital firm', 'Innovation Endeavors', 'public eye', 'Intercontinental Exchange', 'energy costs', 'Strong winds', 'grid transition', 'power mix', 'chief executive', 'Dallas area', 'power-plant outages', 'data provider', 'GridStatus.io', 'larger rivals', 'full day', 'large-scale batteries', 'data centers', 'artificial-intelligence applications', 'institutional-size firms', 'direct access', 'direct-access model', 'small amount', 'regulatory approval', 'Philip Krim', 'mattress seller', 'Casper Sleep', 'climate-tech investor', 'Evan Caron', 'hedge fund', 'Millennium Management', 'early-stage investments', 'Uber Technologies', 'SoFi Technologies', 'focus areas', 'founding partner', 'search giant', 'renewable energy', 'Alexander Osipovich', 'intermittent wind', 'financial contracts', 'hourly contracts', 'increasing use', 'wind farms', 'climate change', 'power companies', 'smaller customers', 'new customers', 'Sam Tegel', 'startup', 'marketplace', 'ElectronX', 'investors', 'Chicago', 'license', 'Germany', 'traders', 'swings', 'Businesses', 'utilities', 'risk', 'debut', 'glut', 'opposite', 'BloombergNEF', 'lot', 'scientists', 'millions', 'February', 'evening', 'May', 'megawatt', 'locations', 'fine', 'month', 'target', 'generators', 'operators', 'hunger', 'brokers', 'collateral', 'money', 'launch', 'time', 'clearinghouse', 'veteran', 'bets', 'Alphabet', 'effort', 'alexo', 'wsj']",2024-06-12,2024-06-12,livemint.com

A country that prided itself on its efficiency  that saw itself as the engine of Europe and boasted of its formidable export machine was  as he put it  slipping to third world status.The coalition government led by Chancellor Olaf Scholz was  he argued  a “catastrophe”  Germany was “economically on the way to becoming a developing country” and “one thing is clear: our reputation in the world has never been so bad”.Predictably  his language was dismissed as inflammatory. According to Verena Hubertz  of the Social Democrats’ parliamentary group  the “bizarre speech is more beer tent than Dax-listed company executive”  while Sandra Detzer  for the Greens  said bashing politicians would “damage our political culture and the prestige of the German economy”.Well  perhaps. And yet all Weimer was really guilty of was the kind of plain talking that British business leaders used to be well known for before they were captured by woke posturing  and restricted themselves to Left-wing  big state platitudes. And Weimer was completely right: the German economy is paying the price for a decade of policy mistakes and for complacently assuming that 20th-century heavy industry could sustain it forever.Under the vastly overrated Angela Merkel  who despite the praise heaped on her by the Remain establishment has left a disastrous legacy  Germany made two major policy mistakes.First  it based its economic model on cheap Russian gas  fuelling an industrial machine built on chemicals and automobiles that requires huge amounts of energy (one BASF plant consumes more gas than the whole of Switzerland). Its nuclear plants were closed down on a whim  fracking was ignored even though Germany has abundant shale oil and gas  and wind and solar power were not built quickly enough to replace it.Under Angela Merkel  Germany made a costly mistake by basing its economic model on cheap Russian gas - EPA/CLEMENS BILANThe result? When Vlaidimir Putin invaded Ukraine and the gas was turned off  German industry was left with some of the highest energy costs in the world  destroying its competitiveness at a stroke. Meanwhile  the Merkel government encouraged huge increases in immigration  using the same arguments familiar to the UK about an ageing population requiring lots of young people to fill all the vacancies.But immigrants  as elsewhere  don’t always have the skills industry needs  and do not necessarily accelerate the growth rate. Sure  a handful of immigrant entrepreneurs might create new industries – although  as it happens  it seems less in Germany than elsewhere – but many are either in low-skilled jobs or else on benefits. Instead  immigration looks to have turned into a drag on the economy.Germany is now in a deep hole. It is the slowest-growing economy in the G7 this year  forecast to expand by a meagre 0.2pc over 2024  significantly slower than the UK. Its stock market is doing just as badly as London’s  with giants such as Linde switching their listing to New York and the few new companies that are emerging listing their shares elsewhere (indeed  the entire German stock market is now worth less than the microchip giant Nvidia).Its once mighty auto industry is stuck in the diesel era and has lost billions developing electric alternatives  only to see sales plummet and the Chinese invade the European market.Meanwhile  the country has failed to adapt to the internet  with no emerging tech start-ups of any significance. True  it still has a huge trade surplus but that is only because domestic demand is so weak and government debt is impressively low  certainly compared with Italy and France.But that is of little use while the constitutional “debt brake” prevents the government from ramping up investment to help new industries emerge. Even when there is investment  such as the huge new Tesla plant outside Berlin constructed with massive government subsidies  green protesters have sought to prevent it from operating effectively.It is hard to see any way out of this mess for the hapless Olaf Scholz. The Social Democrats are in hock to the unions dependent on heavy industry  the Greens refuse to allow any form of serious energy policy while doubling down on anti-growth regulations and the supposedly pro-business Free Democrats don’t have the clout or the ideas to change anything.As the economy stagnates  the AfD is picking up support among angry voters and the Christian Democrats  the traditional centre-Right party  have yet to come up with a programme of radical reform that would make any real difference.One point is certain: as it descends into political chaos  with a comically weak government clinging on desperately to power  the country is not about to start the hard work of rebuilding itself for the 21st century.It is ridiculous to criticise Weimer for simply telling the truth. Indeed  it would be a relief if some of the leaders of the City  and the major British companies  could make the same points about the dire prospects of the UK economy  instead of signing up for platitudes about welcoming “stability” and “partnership” with a Labour government that will prove every bit as disastrous as the floundering Scholz coalition in Berlin.The German economy is descending to third world status  and its hapless political class has no idea how to turn that around – and it will take the rest of the eurozone down with it.Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

As ...,Amidst a backdrop of varied global market performances  the Netherlands' stock market remains a focal point for investors seeking stable dividend yields. As European markets react to economic shifts and policy changes  Dutch stocks offering dividends between 4.2% and 9.5% stand out as potentially appealing options for those looking to balance returns with relative security in the current economic climate.Top 5 Dividend Stocks In The NetherlandsName Dividend Yield Dividend Rating Acomo (ENXTAM:ACOMO) 6.56% ★★★★★☆ ABN AMRO Bank (ENXTAM:ABN) 9.53% ★★★★☆☆ Randstad (ENXTAM:RAND) 4.85% ★★★★☆☆ Koninklijke KPN (ENXTAM:KPN) 4.28% ★★★★☆☆ Koninklijke Heijmans (ENXTAM:HEIJM) 4.40% ★★★★☆☆Click here to see the full list of 5 stocks from our Top Euronext Amsterdam Dividend Stocks screener.Here we highlight a subset of our preferred stocks from the screener.Simply Wall St Dividend Rating: ★★★★☆☆Overview: ABN AMRO Bank N.V. offers a range of banking products and financial services to retail  private  and business clients both in the Netherlands and globally  with a market capitalization of approximately €13.32 billion.Operations: ABN AMRO Bank N.V. generates its revenues primarily through Personal & Business Banking (€4.07 billion)  Corporate Banking (€3.50 billion)  and Wealth Management (€1.59 billion).Dividend Yield: 9.5%ABN AMRO Bank's dividend outlook presents challenges despite a high current yield of 9.53%  ranking in the top 25% in the Dutch market. Although dividends are covered by earnings with a payout ratio of 47.9%  forecasted earnings decline and historical dividend volatility suggest potential instability ahead. Recent strategic moves  including selling a stake in Neuflize Vie and forming partnerships  aim to streamline operations and might slightly boost capital ratios  but the bank's low allowance for bad loans at 32% adds risk to its financial health amidst these changes.ENXTAM:ABN Dividend History as at Jun 2024Simply Wall St Dividend Rating: ★★★★★☆Overview: Acomo N.V. operates in the sourcing  trading  processing  packaging  and distribution of conventional and organic food ingredients for the food and beverage industry across Europe  North America  and other global markets  with a market capitalization of approximately €518.31 million.Operations: Acomo N.V. generates revenue through various segments  including Tea (€120.62 million)  Edible Seeds (€257.29 million)  Food Solutions (€24.07 million)  Spices and Nuts (€429.96 million)  and Organic Ingredients (€436.38 million).Story continuesDividend Yield: 6.6%ACOMO's dividend yield of 6.56% ranks well in the Dutch market  placing it in the top 25%. Despite a high payout ratio of 85.7%  dividends are supported by both earnings and cash flows  with a cash payout ratio at a manageable 26.1%. However  ACOMO's dividend history shows inconsistency with volatile payments over the past decade and an overall unstable track record  alongside concerns regarding its significant debt levels.ENXTAM:ACOMO Dividend History as at Jun 2024Simply Wall St Dividend Rating: ★★★★☆☆Overview: Koninklijke KPN N.V. operates as a telecommunications and IT service provider in the Netherlands  with a market capitalization of approximately €13.80 billion.Operations: Koninklijke KPN N.V. generates revenue through three primary segments: Business (€1.84 billion)  Consumer (€2.93 billion)  and Wholesale (€0.70 billion).Dividend Yield: 4.3%Koninklijke KPN's dividend yield of 4.28% is modest relative to top Dutch payers  but its dividend has grown over the last decade. Dividends are well-supported with a payout ratio of 78.4% and cash payout ratio at 59.6%  indicating sustainability from both earnings and cash flows despite past volatility in payments. The recent strategic formation of TowerCo with ABP enhances KPN’s infrastructure asset optimization  potentially bolstering long-term financial stability  crucial for maintaining future dividend payments amidst a high debt level.ENXTAM:KPN Dividend History as at Jun 2024Seize The OpportunityReveal the 5 hidden gems among our Top Euronext Amsterdam Dividend Stocks screener with a single click here.Invested in any of these stocks?

The new price target is based on a 21 times multiple of the estimated Core Earnings Per Share (EPS) for the year 2025  which is a premium compared to the sector's average of 14 times. This premium is justified by UCB's higher growth prospects  according to JPMorgan.In their assessment  JPMorgan highlighted the strength of UCB's growth  which supports a valuation above the sector average. The firm's rationale for the premium is anchored in what they identify as an Embedded Value of approximately €150 per share for UCB SA.The biopharmaceutical company  which is listed on the Euronext Brussels stock exchange  focuses on developing treatments for severe diseases in several therapeutic areas. With this upgrade and price target adjustment  JPMorgan signals a shift in its valuation methodology for UCB SA  aligning it with the company's growth trajectory and market potential.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

(""DNIHT"") subsidiary company of Industrie De Nora S.p.A. (""De Nora"")  an Italian multinational listed on Euronext Milan  specializing in electrochemistry  a leader in sustainable technologies and the emerging green hydrogen industry  today started the construction works of the Gigafactory  which will become Italy's largest electrolyzer production hub  with a projected capacity of 2GW equivalent by 2030.The groundbreaking ceremony  including laying the foundation stone  took place in the presence of De Nora and Snam's top management and national  regional  and local authorities.The project is part of a larger multi-year expansion plan for the De Nora Group's production capacity and involves constructing a production center in Cernusco sul Naviglio  spanning approximately 25 000 square meters. The facility will serve as Italy's primary hub for electrolyzers used in green hydrogen generation  systems  and components for water electrolysis and fuel cells  and will also be a modern facility serving De Nora's other divisions. In addition to its value from an industrial point of view  the project stands out by its strong focus on sustainability and innovation  adopting a modern concept of industrial architecture based on low environmental impact criteria.The Gigafactory represents a primary industrial asset for De Nora and stands out internationally in terms of production capacity  qualifying as strategic to facilitate the achievement of the sustainability goals part of the European Green Deal. DNHIT  in collaboration with the Ministry of Enterprise and Made in Italy  secured approximately EUR 32 million through a concession decree in July 2023. This funding supports companies participating in Important Projects of Common European Interest (IPCEI Fund) and is financed by PNRR - National Recovery and Resilience Plan resources. Additional funding  up to approximately EUR 63 million  may be available to support the IPCEI Hydrogen1.The initiative will support the reduction of electrolyzer production costs  making a significant contribution to meeting Europe's projected final installed capacity and technology-neutrality target necessary linked to the energy transition process.The location of the Gigafactory in a primarily industrial and manufacturing area not far from Milan will contribute to local economic and employment growth  with the expectation of creating around 200 direct jobs and about 2 000 induced employment opportunities.Construction is expected to be completed between late 2025 and early 2026.Paolo Dellachà  CEO of Industrie De Nora  commented: ""We proudly announce the start of the construction works of the Gigafactory  an ambitious and unique project in terms of production capacity and size  which confirms De Nora's centrality on the European scene as a facilitator of the energy transition process. On the outskirts of Milan will rise the production hub of the future  an example of virtuous unity between sustainability and innovation  where much of the Group's Italian production activity will be concentrated. It will be an architecturally sustainable project  perfectly integrated into the territory where it rises. It will benefit the community  but above all  it will be the fulcrum of a production of technologies for green hydrogen that will have a positive impact on the international decarbonization process.""1 The maximum amount of aid that can be granted to DNHIT has been defined on the basis of the nominal financing gap in Article 5(2) of the Ministerial Decree of April 21  2021.* * *Industrie De Nora is an Italian multinational company listed on the Euronext Milan stock exchange  specializing in electrochemistry  a leader in sustainable technologies  and has a pivotal role in the industrial green hydrogen production chain.

Quantitative and qualitative criteria to assess Directors' independence under Article 6-bis of the EGM Issuers' Regulation approved Arzignano (VI)  June 11  2024 - The Board of Directors of Franchetti S.p.A. (""Franchetti"" or the ""Company""  Ticker BIT: FCH)  a company listed on the Euronext Growth Milan segment of the Italian Stock Exchange and parent of the multinational software development and engineering design Group of the same name  a pioneer in planning  diagnosis and treatment for the safety and predictive planning of maintenance for network infrastructure  particularly bridges and viaducts  hereby announces that the Board of Directors meeting that met today  chaired by Paolo Franchetti  resolved to call the Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting in first call for July 1  2024 and  if necessary  in second call for July 2  2024 (the ""Meeting"")  to take the resolutions described below. At the same meeting  the Board also approved the quantitative and qualitative criteria used to assess the significance of potentially relevant relationships fin order to evaluate the independence of Directors (the ""Policy"")  as required by Article 6-bis of the Euronext Growth Milan Issuers' Regulation. The Policy is available on the Company's website at www.franchetti.tech  in the ""Governance/Company data"" section. Proposal to increase the number of votes allocated to multi-vote shares issued by the Company  from 3 to 10 per share The Board of Directors approved to submit to the Shareholders' Meeting a proposal to increase the number of votes allocated to multi-vote shares issued by the Company (totalling 3 000 000)  from 3 to 10 per multi-voteshare  as allowed by the new paragraph 4 of Civil Code Article 2351  resulting in an amendment to Article 5 Pag. 1of Franchetti's By-Laws (the ""By-Laws""). The Board also decided to submit the same proposal pursuant to art. 2376 of the Civil Code at the special meeting of holders of ordinary shares of the Company which will be held  following the Shareholders' Meeting  on first call on 1 July 2024 and  if necessary  on second call  on 2 July 2024. The Shareholders' Meeting to discuss the aforementioned topic was called by the Board  with the Chairperson of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer  Mr. Paolo Franchetti  and Director Mr. Michele Frizzarin abstaining pursuant to Article 2391 of the Civil Code  following the request sent by the Company's controlling shareholder  Franchetti Holding S.r.l. (the ""Shareholder"")  received by the Company on May 27  2024  concerning the ""Proposal to increase the number of votes allocated to multi-vote shares held by Franchetti Holding S.r.l. from 3 to 10 votes"" (the ""Request""). The Request is part of the innovations introduced by the so- called ""Capital Law""  which modified the article 2351 of the Civil Code increasing the number of votes attributable to multiple voting shares from 3 to 10. We note that the Board of Directors considered it appropriate  for the reasons described below  to call the Shareholders' Meeting to approve the aforementioned proposal even though the Request was not admissible pursuant to Article 2367  paragraph 3  of the Civil Code  as the proposal to increase the number of votes attributed to shares with multi-vote rights  entailing shareholder right of withdrawal pursuant to Article 2437  letter g)  of the Civil Code  is among the matters on which  pursuant to the aforementioned provision  ""the Shareholders' Meeting shall resolve  in accordance with the law  on the proposal of the Directors or on the basis of a draft or a report prepared by them""(i.e.  the report on the liquidation value of shares in the event of withdrawal  prepared pursuant to Article 2437-ter of the Civil Code). The Board of Directors has decided to proceed in any case with the convocation of the meeting as the increase in the number of votes allocated to multi-vote shares would (i) reward and further incentivize the medium- to long- term investment made by shareholder in the Company  also considering the possibility of future transactions to increase the share capital  designed to capitalize the Company and support its growth strategies  which may have dilutive effects on its shareholding structure; (ii) guarantee stability in the Company's shareholding structure  and thus (iii) support a lasting increase in the value of Franchetti shares and company growth that is not only profitable but also sustainable over time. The Company's growth plans target development over a medium- to long-term period  Pag. 2and require the support of Shareholders  such as the Shareholder  whose investment decisions and return prospects align with that timespan. We note that  considering the approval of the proposed increase in votes allocated to multi-vote shares  the Company's current shareholders  other than the Shareholder  will experience a maximum dilution of 3.99% of the voting capital. The Shareholder will acquire 97.53% of the total voting rights. Current Shareholders  meanwhile  will not experience any dilution of their equity or administrative rights other than voting rights. As noted above  the resolution to amend the By-Laws entails shareholder right of withdrawal under Article 2437(g) of the Civil Code. As such  the Shareholders of the Company who do not participate in the resolution of the extraordinary meeting to approve this statutory amendment will have the right of withdrawal  pursuant to articles. 2437 et seq. of the Civil Code. In this regard  taking into account the provisions of Article 2437-ter  Civil Code and having noted the opinion of the Board of Statutory Auditors and Ria Grant Thornton S.p.A. (in its capacity as the entity entrusted with the statutory audit of the Company's accounts)  the Board of Directors has set the unit liquidation value of the Company's shares at Euro 5.56 (five point fifty-six)  in the event that any Franchetti Shareholders entitled to do so exercise their right of withdrawal  for all or some of the shares held  pursuant to Article 2437-bis of the Civil Code  no later than fifteen days after the Shareholders' Meeting resolution is registered in the relevant Companies Register. The Company will promptly notify the market when the Shareholders' Meeting resolution is registered. Finally  we note that the effectiveness of the resolution to amend the By-Laws is subject to occurrence of the following conditions precedent: the votes expressed at the extraordinary meeting of Franchetti by the opposing Shareholders do not represent a percentage greater than 50% plus one share of the ordinary shares with voting rights  other than those held by Franchetti Holding S.r.l.; that the condition precedent that any exercise of the right of withdrawal byFranchetti's Shareholders entails an outlay for the Company of no more than Euro[100.000 00 (one hundred thousand point zero zero). For the sake of clarity  this does not take into account the amounts to be borne by shareholders who exercise their option and pre-emption rights pursuant to Article 2437-quater of the Civil Code  or Pag. 3by any third parties in the liquidation proceedings. Grant of a powers to the Board of Directors to increase the share capital under Article 2443 of the Civil Code The Board of Directors also resolved to submit to the Shareholders' Meeting the grant of powers under Article 2443 of the Civil Code to increase the share capital by a maximum of Euro 10 million  including any share premium (""Powers"")  to be exercised in the period of three years following the date of the Shareholders' Meeting resolution that grants the Powers. More specifically  the Powers are mainly granted in order  pursuant to Article 2443 of the Civil Code  to increase the share capital  on one or more occasions and on a divisible basis  through the issue of ordinary shares: (i) to be offered under option and for payment to those entitled thereto  pursuant to Article 2441 of the Civil Code  establishing the issue price and dividend rights of the shares on a case-by-case basis  or (ii) to be offered in whole or in part to third parties  with the exclusion of option rights pursuant to Article 2441  paragraph 4  second sentence  and paragraph 5  of the Civil Code. The exercise of the Powers will also include the power to establish the issue price of the shares from time to time  including any share premium  in addition to the dividend entitlement  the recipients of the capital increase  and the allotment ratio in the event of option increases for the Company's eligible shareholders. We note that in compliance with the provisions of Article 2441  paragraph 6 of the Civil Code (where applicable)  the issue price of the ordinary shares to be issued in execution of the Powers for the capital increase will be established by the Board of Directors from time to time  taking into account - among other matters - market conditions in general and the performance of Franchetti's stock. This price will also take into account market practice for similar transactions and the application of any discount in line with market practice for similar transactions  potentially referring to the most commonly recognized valuation methodologies used in professional practice  including at the international level  without prejudice to compliance with the relevant legislative and regulatory provisions. The Powers create advantages in terms of flexibility and speed of execution  enabling identification from time to time of the transaction best suited to satisfy the Company's need for financial resources to support its growth path  while also Pag. 4allowing the Company to exploit the most favorable conditions for the execution of corporate transactions that require timely action. The allocation of Powers also has the advantage of deferring to the Board of Directors the determination of the economic conditions of the offer as a whole  depending on the prevailing market conditions at the time of the actual launch of the transaction. Among other things  this can reduce the risk of fluctuations in stock market prices between the time of the announcement and the time of the launch of the transaction  which would occur if this was decided by the Shareholders' Meeting. The resources raised through the potential exercise of the Powers may  in addition to growth strategies  also be allocated to strengthening existing investments and  more generally  to meeting the Company's future financial needs. The newly issued shares resulting from the subscription of the capital increase carried out in exercise of the Powers shall have regular dividend rights and  therefore  will grant the relevant subscribers identical rights to those conferred by the Company's ordinary shares in circulation on the date of issue. Finally  we note that approval of the Powers will result in the amendment of Article 5 of the By-Laws  to which the relevant transitional clause will be added. Proposed amendment to Articles 13  14 and 19 of the By-Laws Finally  the Board of Directors resolved to call the Shareholders' Meeting to resolve on amendments to Articles 13  14 and 19 of the By-Laws to incorporate the changes made to Article 6-bis of the Euronext Growth Milan Issuers' Regulation (effective December 4  2023)  and the power to establish that attendance at the Shareholders' Meeting and the exercise of voting rights shall take place exclusively through the Company's designated representative pursuant to Article 135-undecies of the CFA and by means of telecommunication. * * * The documentation required by current regulations  including the Board of Directors' Explanatory Report on the Shareholders' Meeting Agenda Items and the Report on the Determination of the Liquidation Value of Shares in the Event of Withdrawal  along with their attachments  will be made available at the Company's registered office  and on the Company's website  in the ""Governance/Assemblies"" section  and on the website www.borsaitaliana.it  in the ""Shares/Documents"" Pag. 5",neutral,0.14,0.85,0.02,neutral,0.08,0.86,0.06,True,English,"[""Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting"", 'Franchetti S', 'multi-vote shares', 'proxy proposal', 'share capital', 'maximum total', 'Board', 'Directors', 'votes', 'Euro', '3', 'Franchetti Holding S.r.l.', ""Euronext Growth Milan Issuers' Regulation"", 'Franchetti S.p.A.

The firm's revised forecasts suggest a more optimistic view than the consensus for the years 2024 to 2029  with expectations of 6-60% higher figures.The upgrade in the price target is driven by a number of factors  including anticipated faster revenue growth and higher peak sales for UCB's products Bimzelx and Rystiggo. These expectations are based on current prescription trends and expanding market developments in health insurance systems.Additionally  Citi anticipates an atopic dermatitis asset from UCB's pipeline to advance into Phase III clinical trials  which could further boost the company's prospects.Citi also pointed out the dynamics surrounding Cimzia  a product of UCB  which might benefit from the delayed market entry of competitor Xbrane's biosimilar until at least 2029. Furthermore  a potential revenue increase could arise from a Phase II combination study of Johnson & Johnson's nipocalimab in rheumatoid arthritis.The financial outlook for UCB is also bolstered by factors such as the underappreciated dynamics of Evenity  which contributes 20-30% of the group's EBITDA  the intellectual property extension for Fintepla until 2033  and royalty revenues from Merck and Sanofi (NASDAQ: )'s oral PCSK9/TNFi pipeline assets.Citi forecasts a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for UCB's sales  EBITDA  and EPS from 2024 to 2029 at 11%  27%  and 33%  respectively. Despite this robust growth outlook  UCB's stock is currently trading at a 2025 price-to-earnings (PE) ratio of 17 times  which is higher than the EU Pharma sector's average PE ratio  excluding Novo Nordisk (NYSE: )  which trades around 13 times with a CAGR of 5/6/8%. The new net present value (NPV)-derived price target of €161 reflects a bull-bear valuation range of €224 to €109.InvestingPro InsightsUCB SA (OTC: UCBJY) has shown a remarkable consistency in shareholder returns  having raised its dividend for an impressive 15 consecutive years. This trend is supported by the company's ability to maintain dividend payments over the last 45 years  signaling a strong commitment to its shareholders. With a market capitalization of $27.63 billion USD  UCB's financial stability is further underscored by its moderate level of debt and a dividend yield of 0.65%.Investors may also take note of UCB's price performance  with the stock trading near its 52-week high and experiencing a significant price uptick over the last six months. The 6-month price total return stands at a robust 71.23%  highlighting the positive market sentiment towards the company.

This agreement follows similar agreements signed with agents or industrial partners in India  China  and Korea.Tai-Fung Group is a trading company based in Taipei  established in 1949  employing 110 people including 80 people in Taiwan and generating $300 million in contracts annually. The company is particularly active in the energy sector and represents major industrial clients on an international scale.The island of Taiwan has significant potential geothermal resources that have been largely untapped to date and are well-suited for ORC technology. The country also has heavy industries (cement  glass  steel  petrochemicals) that are targets for converting waste heat into electricity using ORCs  and industries such as paper  chemicals  and agro-industry that are ideal for the company's high-temperature Heat Pump offerings. Taiwanese industrial groups are also internationally present with factories covered by the agreement with the Tai-Fung Group.Enertime is also active in the Philippines and Thailand  two countries with high development potential. In the Philippines  the company has identified a strong acceleration in the electric geothermal market where Enertime is positioning itself with its ORC technology  along with electricity prices that favor energy efficiency. In Thailand  where Enertime has a reference for a 1.8 MW ORC system in a flat glass factory implemented with a local partner on a third-party financed model without subsidies  the company relies on this local partner to offer turnkey ORC systems.In China  where the company has a major reference with a 3 MW ORC system in a Chinese steel mill  Enertime is in discussions with large Chinese industrial groups for collaborations and potential sales of new manufacturing licenses.In South Korea and India  ENERTIME has signed two partnership agreements  one with a Korean industrial company and the other with an Indian energy industrial company  to integrate its turbines manufactured in France into ORC systems designed and produced locally. Several contracts are under discussion with a target for orders in 2024.Gilles David  CEO of ENERTIME declares: « The signing of an agreement with Tai-Fung Group is recognition of the relevance of ENERTIME's offering in Asia and more generally internationally. Our ORC and high-temperature Heat Pump technologies have caught the attention of Tai-Fung Group  which is a major historical player in Taiwan and works on the Taiwanese and Chinese markets with the biggest names in the global energy industry. Enertime thus continues the legacy of the French electromechanical industry in an international context where energy efficiency and decentralized  non-intermittent  CO2 emission-free energy production are not only environmental but also strategic issues. »ABOUT ENERTIMEIncorporated in 2008  ENERTIME designs  develops  and implements Organic Rankine Cycle (ORC) machines and high temperature heat pumps for industrial energy efficiency and decentralized production of renewable energy. ORC machines convert heat into electricity. Heat pumps use low-temperature heat to produce high-temperature heat.ENERTIME is the only company in the world offering ORC machines and a portfolio of technology in the field of thermodynamics for the energy transition. For ORC technology  it is one of the four main global players and the only French compagny fully mastering this technology of high-power machines (1 MW and more). The Company is qualified as an ""innovative company"" by BPIFrance and is featured in the prestigious ""The Innovation Leaders"" ranking from “Les Echos” newspaper  ranked 5th out of 200 french companies overall and 1st in the energy sector.

Developed with security and privacy at the core  Thales’ Digital ID Services Platform powers the app and provides a cybersecure home for users’ identity data. The Queensland app is the first digital licence in Australia that is aligned with international standards for mobile driver licences  enabling users to present and share their digital ID’s in other local and international jurisdictions following the standard.The Queensland Digital Licence App has reached over 500 000 users since its launch on 1 November  2023  showing a clear appetite from Queensland residents for safe and secure digital identity. Thales and Queensland Department of Transport and Main Roads (TMR) released the new app to all Queensland residents following a successful pilot and an extended trial in Townsville  where engagement with real end users  businesses  and industry groups provided valuable insights to the project in readiness for the launch.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240611475244/en/Credit: Queensland Department of Transport and Main RoadsWith core technology provided by Thales  supported by development and operations from local partners Code Heroes and Aliva  the QLD Digital Licence app is simple to use  secure  and designed with data security and user privacy in mind. The app includes features such as multi-factor authentication  integration with the Queensland Digital Identity (QDI) service  and built-in verification for secure user-to-user information exchange. The app's consent-based design gives the individual control over their identity data – users can present or share information from the app by selecting from common use cases that disclose only the relevant information for the transaction  such as ‘proof of age’  which displays an ‘over 18’ screen without exposing date of birth  address  or driving information – a popular feature. The app currently provides digital driver licences  proof of age (18+) cards  and marine licences  with the potential for more digital documents in future.Businesses that need to check identity or age requirements to provide goods or services can download the standalone (QLD) Verifier for Digital Licence app  which electronically confirms the authenticity of data received from a Digital Licence app. Digital verification is also expected to help businesses reduce the need to store sensitive identity data attributes as the process of verification is quick and simple  allowing for point-in-time verification in a wide range of use cases. The requirements to develop verification functionality are publicly available within the mobile driving licence app standard (ISO/IEC18013-5)  allowing the larger ecosystem to build complementary verification solutions and enhance the usability of the digital licence in everyday life.The QLD Digital Licence app and Verifier for Digital Licence app developed by Thales  are available now to Queensland residents via the mobile app stores.“Nothing is more important that your private data  which should be highly protected. We are proud of the current success of the Queensland Digital Licence app  ensuring the safety and security of private information while offering a modern digital experience. The app undergoes rigorous privacy and information security testing to protect identity. It aligns with international standards for mobile driver licences  setting the standard for mobile driver licence apps across Australia and the world” commentedMark Bailey  Minister for Transport and Main Roads.“Through this collaboration  Thales demonstrates a field-proven capacity to provide citizens with highly convenient and secure solutions  allowing them to reap the full benefits of digitalization. The Queensland Digital Licence App is a significant milestone in the digital ID market  showing the growing importance of and appetite for alignment to international standards for mobile driving licences and interoperability across country borders” said Youzec Kurp  Senior Vice President Identity and Biometric Solutions at Thales.About ThalesThales (Euronext Paris: HO) is a global leader in advanced technologies specialized in three business domains: Defence & Security  Aeronautics & Space  and Cybersecurity & Digital identity.It develops products and solutions that help make the world safer  greener and more inclusive.The Group invests close to €4 billion a year in Research & Development  particularly in key innovation areas such as AI  cybersecurity  quantum technologies  cloud technologies and 6G.Thales has close to 81 000 employees in 68 countries.

This major technological breakthrough  which has already prompted discussions with industrial partners for the exploitation and integration of this technology in the biogas and biomethane sectors  opens a new chapter in the company's history. BOOSTHEAT will now seek to monetize its strategic asset and is radically evolving its organization in this new context.I DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGY FOR INDUSTRIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGESUnder the impetus of HBR Investment Group  BOOSTHEAT has been engaged in an ambitious development program  serving the acceleration of the ecological transition  since the beginning of 2023. This research work  which has mobilized teams for over 1 year  has resulted in the development of the first hybrid compressor meeting 3 criteria:Versatility: Highlighting the distinct advantages of hybrid compression  which take full advantage of the combination of thermal and electrical energy for optimum efficiency. Scalability: Develop an innovative compression architecture that enables the creation of products with varied capacities  ranging from 50 to 250 kW  thus meeting the market's diversified needs. Performance: Significantly increase the performance of BOOSTHEAT's existing compressors  reinforcing its leading position in the field of gas-fired or waste-heat heat pumps.BOOSTHEAT has now finalized an ambitious test program focused on the validation of the different operating modes (Stirling Heat Pump / micro-cogeneration / Hybrid Heat Pump)  illustrating the advantages of each for industry and future uses of the technology.The completion of BOOSTHEAT's hybrid compressor test program symbolizes a major achievement  perfectly meeting the ambitious strategic objectives set by the management team and confirming the strengths of BOOSTHEAT's patented technology.I A STRATEGIC ASSET TO BE VALUEDTo make the most of this strategic asset  BOOSTHEAT has chosen to approach industrial players likely to acquire and exploit the hybrid compressor to bring it to industrial scale.For the record  BOOSTHEAT has already received 2 letters of interest from recognized players in the biogas and biomethane production sector  ideally positioned to benefit from this technology  and hopes to attract interest from industrial players in the compression and HVAC fields  such as manufacturers of heating and cooling equipment.BOOSTHEAT is committed to the same strategy for its new ImpliciX software solution  which enables industrial companies to optimize product performance and maintenance operations. This pilot solution has already led to the signature of a letter of interest from Proxipel  an industrial player specializing in the processing and valorization of biomass  for the integration of ImpliciX in their future generations of pellet machines.I ADAPT THE ORGANIZATION TO PRESERVE RESOURCESTo ensure the financial visibility needed to implement this asset enhancement strategy  BOOSTHEAT has decided to implement a drastic cost-cutting plan and has the reaffirmed support of its financial partners. To focus its financial resources on issues directly linked to the implementation of this asset enhancement strategy  BOOSTHEAT has decided to stop all other operating expenses  cut around 10 positions and terminate non-essential contracts. The aim is to reduce cash consumption linked to operations and investments from an average of €375.000 per month in 2023 to an average of around €100.000 per month from the 2nd half of 2024.At the same time  BOOSTHEAT is working closely with its partners and with the renewed support of HBR Investment Group to clear its liabilities  particularly the bank debts from the safeguard plan still outstanding representing a nominal value of €5.6 million. For the record  HBR Investment Group has already acquired the €8.0 million bond debt during the observation period and has undertaken not to seek cash repayment of these receivables. This drastic cost-cutting plan  combined with the support of HBR Investment Group and the maximum residual financing capacity of €22.8 million through the bond financing line  should enable the company to continue as a going concern.Emilien Benhard  BOOSTHEAT's Director of Operations  says: ""I'm very proud of the work we've accomplished in record time to make available to energy performance professionals two unrivalled innovative solutions  our hybrid compressor and our software suite. I'd like to extend my warmest thanks to all those who made this success possible and hope that tomorrow we'll see a bit of ""BOOSTHEAT inside"" in the future products of the energy revolution.""Hugo BRUGIERE  CEO of BOOSTHEAT  added: ""HBR Investment Group has fully played its role as reference investor to make possible the tremendous work done by all the teams led by Emilien over the last few months. Now it's time to capitalize on this intense work by finding partners with the capacity to integrate these revolutions into large-scale industrial solutions. At the same time  the Board of Directors is considering the best options for the Company's future.""* * *Find out more about BOOSTHEAT atwww.boostheat-group.comABOUT BOOSTHEATFounded in 2011  BOOSTHEAT is a player in the energy efficiency sector.

The study enrolled 30 patients in the U.S. in two cohorts that differed only in the concentration of GM-CSF used as vaccine adjuvant. With a minimum follow-up of 4 years (median 53.0 months)  the updated OS results show that all patients who were alive at the 3-year mark remain alive at 4 years  with an OS rate of 69.5%Ultimovacs has previously reported data showing a complete response rate in the UV1-103 study of 33% (complete disappearance of tumors) and an objective response rate of 57% (complete or partial disappearance of tumors). Biomarker analyses reported in October 2022 showed robust clinical responses in patients treated with the combination of UV1 and pembrolizumab  regardless of patients’ PD-L1 status. The safety profile of UV1 in combination with pembrolizumab is comparable to that of pembrolizumab alone.“We are encouraged by the strong overall survival rate observed in this Phase I study ” said Jens Bjørheim  Chief Medical Officer at Ultimovacs. “The data show a high survival rate among patients enrolled in the UV1-103 trial  even after a minimum of 4 years of follow-up. We look forward to the read-out of the FOCUS trial in head and neck cancer  where the same treatment combination has been used”.==ENDS==About the UV1-103 phase I trial in Malignant MelanomaThis US-based Phase I clinical trial evaluates the Company’s lead candidate  UV1  combined with the anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor  pembrolizumab  as a first-line treatment in patients with unresectable metastatic malignant melanoma. The trial evaluates safety  tolerability  and initial signs of clinical response. Thirty patients in the U.S. were treated in the study in two cohorts that differed only in the concentration of GM-CSF used as vaccine adjuvant. The 20 patients in the first cohort received a 37.5 mcg GM-CSF adjuvant dose per UV1 vaccination. The 10 patients in the second cohort received the standard 75 mcg GM-CSF adjuvant dose per UV1 vaccination. The study has completed the enrollment of 30 patients  as announced on August 18  2020. All included patients received the drugs as first-line treatment for advanced and metastatic malignant melanoma.Compiled clinical results for the 30 patients enrolled are:Objective response rate (ORR): 57%. Complete response rate (CR): 33%Median Progression Free Survival (mPFS): 18.9 months (as measured by iRECIST)Overall survival (OS) after 12 months: 87% after 24 months: 73% after 36 months: 69.5% after 48 months: 69.5% Out of the 9 deaths  4 happened during the first year  4 during the second year  and one during the third year across both cohorts.Three patients in cohort 1 chose not to be followed beyond 24 months. The trial had previously reached its primary endpoint of safety and tolerability  and no unexpected safety issues related to UV1 have been observed in this trial.As a historical reference (not head-to-head comparison since dosing and the patient population are different)  the registrational study for pembrolizumab  Keynote-006  showed an overall survival rate of 42% at 48 months (Long GV et al  ASCO 2018).The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted a dual Fast Track designation for UV1 in combination with checkpoint inhibitors in the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma – either as add-on therapy to pembrolizumab or as add-on therapy to ipilimumab.About UltimovacsUltimovacs is a clinical-stage biotechnology leader in novel immunotherapeutic cancer vaccines. The lead cancer vaccine candidate UV1 is an off-the-shelf vaccine directed against human telomerase (hTERT)  an antigen present in 85-90% of cancers in all stages of tumor growth. A broad clinical program  with Phase II trials in five cancer indications enrolling more than 670 patients  aims to investigate UV1’s impact in combination with other immunotherapies in multiple cancer types. UV1 is a patented technology owned by Ultimovacs. In addition  Ultimovacs’ adjuvant platform  based on the proprietary Tetanus-Epitope-Targeting (TET) technology  combines tumor-specific antigens and adjuvant in the same molecule and is in Phase I clinical development. The Company is listed on the Euronext Oslo Stock Exchange (ULTI).About UV1UV1 is a therapeutic cancer vaccine designed to induce a specific T-cell response against telomerase. UV1 consists of long  synthetic peptides representing a sequence in the reverse transcriptase subunit of telomerase (hTERT)  shown to induce CD4+ T-cells. These CD4+ T-cells have the potential to provide inflammatory signals  and T-cell support is believed to be critical for triggering a strong anti-tumor immune response. Following intradermal injection  antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in the skin are exposed to the vaccine peptides. These APCs will process the peptides and present vaccine epitopes on Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) molecules to naïve T-cells in the lymph nodes. Activated vaccine-specific T-cells will then enter the circulation and search for cells displaying their cognate antigen in the context of HLA molecules.The UV1 peptides contain several epitopes  shown to be non-restrictive in terms of (HLA) alleles for presentation. It is  therefore  not required to perform HLA pre-screening of patients  which potentially enables broad population utilization of the vaccine. UV1 is administered over three months with eight intradermal injections and the immune-modulator GM-CSF.For further information  please see www.ultimovacs.com or contact:Carlos de Sousa  CEOEmail: carlos.desousa@ultimovacs.comPhone: +47 908 92507Anne Worsøe  Head of Investor RelationsEmail: anne.worsoe@ultimovacs.comPhone: +47 90686815This information is considered inside information pursuant to the EU Market Abuse Regulation and is subject to disclosure requirements pursuant to Section 5-12 in the Norwegian Securities Trading Act.This stock exchange announcement was published by Anne Worsøe  Head of IR at Ultimovacs ASA  on June 11  2024  at 07:00 am CET.This information is subject to the disclosure requirements pursuant to Section 5-12 the Norwegian Securities Trading Act,neutral,0.03,0.81,0.16,mixed,0.31,0.36,0.33,True,English,"['Phase I study', 'strong overall survival', 'UV1 cancer vaccine', 'malignant melanoma', 'Ultimovacs', 'update', 'patients', 'pembrolizumab', 'standard 75 mcg GM-CSF adjuvant dose', 'US-based Phase I clinical trial', 'UV1-103 Phase I clinical trial', 'dual Fast Track designation', 'Phase I clinical development', 'proprietary Tetanus-Epitope-Targeting (TET) technology', '37.5 mcg GM-CSF adjuvant dose', 'lead cancer vaccine candidate UV1', 'Euronext Oslo Stock Exchange', 'novel immunotherapeutic cancer vaccines', 'Median Progression Free Survival', 'UV1-103 phase I trial', 'strong overall survival rate', 'The U.S. Food', 'anti-PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab', 'unresectable metastatic malignant melanoma', 'Phase I study', 'Phase II trials', 'robust clinical responses', 'broad clinical program', 'five cancer indications', 'multiple cancer types', 'high survival rate', 'universal cancer vaccine', 'next key milestone', 'Jens Bjørheim', 'Chief Medical Officer', 'clinical-stage biotechnology leader', 'objective response rate', 'overall survival (OS', 'complete response rate', 'clinical-stage biotechnology company', 'The UV1-103 study', 'unexpected safety issues', 'patients’ PD-L1 status', 'Ultimovacs’ adjuvant platform', 'minimum follow-up period', 'lead candidate', 'same treatment combination', 'vaccine adjuvant', 'metastatic melanoma', 'clinical results', 'UV1-103 trial', 'neck cancer', 'OS rate', 'checkpoint inhibitors', 'patented technology', 'The Company', 'shelf vaccine', 'same molecule', 'FOCUS trial', 'complete disappearance', 'first-line treatment', 'OS results', '3-year mark', 'partial disappearance', 'Biomarker analyses', 'initial signs', 'first year', 'second year', 'third year', 'primary endpoint', 'historical reference', 'patient population', 'Long GV', 'Drug Administration', 'human telomerase', 'tumor growth', 'other immunotherapies', 'tumor-specific antigens', 'median 53.0 months', 'registrational study', 'safety profile', 'first cohort', 'second cohort', 'OSE ULTI', 'advanced non-resectable', 'two cohorts', 'UV1 vaccination', 'head comparison', 'Ultimovacs ASA', 'Thirty patients', 'Three patients', '30 patients', '20 patients', '10 patients', '670 patients', '18.9 months', '12 months', '24 months', '36 months', '48 months', '3 years', '4 years', 'readout', 'Q3 2024', 'data', 'concentration', 'tumors', 'October', 'ENDS', 'tolerability', 'enrollment', 'August', 'drugs', 'ORR', 'CR', 'mPFS', 'iRECIST', '9 deaths', 'dosing', 'Keynote', 'ASCO', 'FDA', 'therapy', 'ipilimumab', 'hTERT', 'cancers', 'stages', 'impact', 'addition']",2024-06-11,2024-06-12,marketscreener.com

But the completion of EMU is crucial if the EU is to ever fulfil its economic potential.Moreover  economic growth across the 27 member states is an important bulwark against the rise of political extremes.CMU was first proposed in 2015 as a response to the 2008 economic crash that at one stage threatened to sunder the single market. It aims to develop a deep and liquid capital market across the EU  which would enable companies in every member state to access the funding needed to grow and expand.Nowhere is this more important than in Ireland. In the years leading up to 2008  domestic Irish firms relied heavily on bank lending to raise capital. As part of EU Banking Union  banks are limited in how much they can lend to any one sector  including corporates.READ MOREIrish firms have been doubly hamstrung in recent years. Some of the biggest companies that were listed on Euronext Dublin have quit the exchange and moved to much more liquid markets in the US. This has prompted fears about the future viability of the Irish stock market.The rationale for CMU is compelling. The EU has an ambitious growth agenda  including embracing the opportunities presented by the digital economy and transitioning to the green economy. But as it stands  the EU is falling behind the US and China.The completion of CMU has the potential to unlock billions in private capital across the EU that would stoke much-needed economic growth.Ursula von der Leyen  seeking a second term as President of the European Commission  has said CMU is one of her main priorities. It must be hoped she follows through on that commitment and that CMU becomes a reality within the lifetime of the next parliament.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved Kevzara® (sarilumab) for the treatment of patients weighing 63 kg or greater with active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (pJIA)  a form of arthritis that impacts multiple joints at a time.“Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis can be a painful disease for children where multiple joints are impacted by this chronic infammation ” said George D. Yancopoulos  M.D.  Ph.D.  Board co-Chair  President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron. ""Not only are their daily lives impacted  but their futures can be disrupted without adequate treatment. The approval of Kevzara in polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis provides these vulnerable patients and their families a new FDA-approved treatment option to help navigate this disease.”The FDA approval in this patient population is supported by evidence from adequate and well-controlled studies and pharmacokinetic data from adults with rheumatoid arthritis as well as a pharmacokinetic  pharmacodynamic  dose finding and safety study in pediatric patients with pJIA.People living with pJIA may experience joint symptoms such as pain  stiffness and swelling  which may restrict their activities and make certain aspects of their day-to-day life incredibly challenging. The disease can lead to an increased risk of permanent joint damage as well as delayed growth and development  due to chronic joint inflammation.No new adverse reactions (ARs) and safety concerns were identified in the pJIA population compared to the rheumatoid arthritis population. The most common adverse drug reactions for patients with pJIA were nasopharyngitis  neutropenia  upper respiratory tract infection  and injection site erythema.

Kevzara is also approved in the U.S. for the treatment of polymyalgia rheumatica – an inflammatory rheumatic disease – in adult patients who have had an inadequate response to corticosteroids or who cannot tolerate corticosteroid taper.Kevzara binds specifically to the IL-6 receptor and has been shown to inhibit IL-6-mediated signaling. IL-6 is an immune system protein produced in increased quantities in patients with rheumatoid arthritis and has been associated with disease activity  joint destruction and other systemic problems.Sarilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement.About Regeneron's VelocImmune® TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder  President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create a substantial proportion of all original  FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies.
