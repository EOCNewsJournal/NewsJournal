This startup is looking to help.,ElectronX has raised a $15 million seed round from investors led by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt’s venture-capital firm  Innovation Endeavors. The startup  which has previously kept out of the public eye  is set to announce the funding round later Wednesday.,"A startup is aiming to build a marketplace where companies can shield themselves from the wild price volatility associated with intermittent wind and solar power  along with extreme weather events such as the recent Texas heat waves.ElectronX has raised a $15 million seed round from investors led by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt’s venture-capital firm  Innovation Endeavors. The startup  which has previously kept out of the public eye  is set to announce the funding round later Wednesday.Based in Chicago  ElectronX is applying for a license from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to run a futures exchange. If approved  ElectronX would be taking on two large incumbents that already operate electricity futures markets: Intercontinental Exchange  or ICE  and Germany’s Deutsche Börse  which offers U.S. electricity futures through its Nodal Exchange unit.Electricity futures are financial contracts that allow traders to bet on swings in power prices. Businesses such as utilities can also use them to hedge against the risk of price volatility.ElectronX’s planned debut comes as the increasing use of cleaner energy sources has made it harder to forecast energy costs because of the intermittent nature of wind and solar power. Strong winds can send power prices plummeting while wind farms create a glut of electricity. The opposite might happen if the weather shifts. In 2023  a record 23% of U.S. electricity demand was supplied by renewable sources  according to BloombergNEF.“The grid transition has massively changed the power mix in the U.S.  and it’s caused a lot of intermittent stability issues "" said Sam Tegel  chief executive of ElectronX.Meanwhile  extreme weather events—which scientists expect to grow more frequent with climate change—are also roiling energy markets. A freak winter storm that left millions of Texas residents without electricity in February 2021 cost power companies more than $10 billion  according to S&P Global Market Intelligence. On the evening of May 8  wholesale electricity prices in the Dallas area skyrocketed to just under $5 000 per megawatt-hour from about $142 in two hours amid a heat wave and power-plant outages  according to data provider GridStatus.io.ElectronX’s first futures contracts will be tied to electricity prices in Texas  and it will eventually list contracts tied to power prices at locations nationwide  Tegel said.Unlike its larger rivals  ElectronX plans to offer contracts tied to the hourly price of electricity. The startup says its hourly contracts will allow customers to have a more fine-tuned hedging tool than they can find at ICE or Nodal Exchange  whose electricity futures are generally based on the average price of power over a full day or month.ElectronX says its target customers include generators of wind and solar power  operators of large-scale batteries  and data centers whose hunger for electricity is expected to grow as artificial-intelligence applications gobble up ever more energy.The startup aims to serve smaller customers as well as the institutional-size firms that trade on ICE and Nodal Exchange. Unlike the incumbents  ElectronX plans to offer direct access to its market without requiring customers to use brokers  known as futures commission merchants  that hold collateral for traders on traditional futures exchanges.The direct-access model could make it simpler for ElectronX to bring aboard new customers. But it also means that  at least initially  ElectronX won’t be able to offer leveraged trading  in which a trader uses a relatively small amount of money to place a large bet.ElectronX’s launch could still be many months away because of the time needed to win regulatory approval for its exchange and clearinghouse.The startup was founded in 2022 by Philip Krim  the former CEO of mattress seller Casper Sleep  who has since become a climate-tech investor  and former power trader Evan Caron. Tegel joined as CEO in 2023. A veteran of electronic trading  Tegel previously worked at high-speed trading firm Jump Trading and hedge fund Millennium Management.Innovation Endeavors said it put up $10 million for ElectronX’s funding round. Schmidt’s firm specializes in early-stage investments. It has previously placed bets on Uber Technologies and SoFi Technologies  and it describes climate as one of its focus areas.Schmidt  a founding partner of Innovation Endeavors  was CEO of Google from 2001 to 2011  before it was restructured and renamed Alphabet. During his time at the search giant  Google stepped up the use of renewable energy to power its data centers as part of an effort to become carbon-neutral.Write to Alexander Osipovich at alexo@wsj.com",neutral,0.27,0.61,0.12,negative,0.02,0.34,0.64,True,English,"['Wild weather', 'electricity prices', 'startup', 'S&P Global Market Intelligence', 'former Google CEO Eric Schmidt', 'recent Texas heat waves', 'U.S. electricity demand', 'Commodity Futures Trading Commission', 'U.S. electricity futures', 'futures commission merchants', 'Deutsche Börse', 'freak winter storm', 'tuned hedging tool', 'traditional futures exchanges', 'extreme weather events', '$15 million seed round', 'intermittent stability issues', 'wild price volatility', 'first futures contracts', 'high-speed trading firm', 'electricity futures markets', 'cleaner energy sources', 'wholesale electricity prices', 'Nodal Exchange unit', 'former power trader', 'two large incumbents', 'former CEO', 'leveraged trading', 'electronic trading', 'Jump Trading', 'renewable sources', 'energy markets', 'two hours', 'large bet', 'funding round', 'intermittent nature', 'Texas residents', 'hourly price', 'average price', 'power prices', 'solar power', 'venture-capital firm', 'Innovation Endeavors', 'public eye', 'Intercontinental Exchange', 'energy costs', 'Strong winds', 'grid transition', 'power mix', 'chief executive', 'Dallas area', 'power-plant outages', 'data provider', 'GridStatus.io', 'larger rivals', 'full day', 'large-scale batteries', 'data centers', 'artificial-intelligence applications', 'institutional-size firms', 'direct access', 'direct-access model', 'small amount', 'regulatory approval', 'Philip Krim', 'mattress seller', 'Casper Sleep', 'climate-tech investor', 'Evan Caron', 'hedge fund', 'Millennium Management', 'early-stage investments', 'Uber Technologies', 'SoFi Technologies', 'focus areas', 'founding partner', 'search giant', 'renewable energy', 'Alexander Osipovich', 'intermittent wind', 'financial contracts', 'hourly contracts', 'increasing use', 'wind farms', 'climate change', 'power companies', 'smaller customers', 'new customers', 'Sam Tegel', 'startup', 'marketplace', 'ElectronX', 'investors', 'Chicago', 'license', 'Germany', 'traders', 'swings', 'Businesses', 'utilities', 'risk', 'debut', 'glut', 'opposite', 'BloombergNEF', 'lot', 'scientists', 'millions', 'February', 'evening', 'May', 'megawatt', 'locations', 'fine', 'month', 'target', 'generators', 'operators', 'hunger', 'brokers', 'collateral', 'money', 'launch', 'time', 'clearinghouse', 'veteran', 'bets', 'Alphabet', 'effort', 'alexo', 'wsj']",2024-06-12,2024-06-13,livemint.com

""Uncertainty about the future of Ukraine  uncertainty about the fate of democracy.""So it's really important for these leaders to come together and demonstrate that they can do something in response to these challenges.""The annual international forum brings together seven of the world's advanced economies — Canada  the U.S.  the U.K  Italy  France  Germany and Japan — and the European Union for informal group conversations and one-on-one talks.The three-day summit that starts Thursday is particularly significant this year  Paris said  because there is ""much more competition and disagreement in the world"" and many global institutions are no longer working ""very effectively.""Many observers say the G7 could project an image of unity by finding a new way to fund Ukraine's ongoing fight against Russia.But G7 leaders could also struggle to come to a consensus on the conflict in Gaza  which could overshadow the official agenda  said Thomas Juneau  an associate professor in the department of political science at the University of Ottawa.""It will be a bit difficult because there is a number of divergences of views between Europeans and the Americans in particular  but even within Europe "" said Juneau. ""It will definitely be a challenge for the G7 not to be derailed in some ways by what's going to happen in Gaza.""Palestinians inspect the damage following a raid by Israeli forces in the Jabalia refugee camp in the northern Gaza Strip on May 30  2024.

(Efrem Lukatsky/The Associated Press)The U.S. Congress approved a $61 billion military aid package for Ukraine last month  but only after political conflict within the U.S. Republican Party delayed the package for six months.Now  the U.S. is expected to push G7 leaders to come out with a new financial package using the interest on roughly 200 billion euros in frozen Russian assets held by the financial institution Euroclear in Belgium  said Max Bergmann  a director at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.Those frozen assets are generating billions of dollars in interest every year  he said. The idea is to use that money to secure a $50 billion bank loan for ongoing support for Ukraine  he added.""The major purpose of this is that there's desperation for how to get Ukraine ... money and then also ramp up defence industrial production "" said Bergmann.But the idea comes with complications  said Bergmann — including the fact that ambassadors from EU member states already have agreed in principle to seize windfall profits from frozen Russian assets to buy weapons for Ukraine.Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland met with G7 finance ministers in Italy last last month. She said she encouraged her counterparts to ""make full use of frozen Russian central bank assets to pay for Ukraine's recovery and reconstruction.""""Canada is in a bit of a position of being fortunate to be able to advocate for a good idea without bearing the direct repercussions of anything that might come from changes to the international financing arrangements "" Perry said.The RCMP said last month it has frozen $140 million in Russian assets in Canada since February 2022  when Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Global Affairs Canada said it also ordered the seizure of a Russian plane and a company believed to be tied to a Russian oligarch.The recent federal budget said Canada is committed to exploring with allies ""possible legal mechanisms to make full use of these assets.""Artificial intelligence in warfareThe Pope will join this year's G7 summit for the first time ever  for talks on artificial intelligence.

Now it can generate close to 100 targets a day  she said — putting heavy pressure on human operators to make quick decisions that could have a ""profound impact.""""With speed  there comes the potential that you are engaging the wrong targets or that you are targeting civilian areas or specific infrastructure "" she said.WATCH: How sea drones and AI are reshaping naval warfare How sea drones and AI are reshaping naval warfare Duration 6:07 Smaller  cheaper sea drones and artificial intelligence are disrupting how war is waged in Ukraine and beyond.

A bombshell report released last week by a committee of parliamentarians claims there's intelligence indicating that some elected officials have ""semi-wittingly or wittingly"" helped foreign governments like China and India meddle in Canadian politics.Some experts say Canada also needs to actively engage in discussions on another key topic: Africa.Italy's right-wing government unveiled a multi-billion dollar plan this year to curb migration by boosting economic growth across Africa.Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has said artificial intelligence and development in Africa will be at the heart of the G7 summit's agenda in Italy.

Artprice is an active sponsor of the International Congress of Art History (CIHA) which this year will be attended by well over a thousand researchers from over 70 countries (June 23 to 28)In a few days  the 36th edition of the International Congress of Art History (CIHA) will open at the Lyon Convention Center (June 23 to 28). This is a very exceptional event that will not be repeated in France for several decades.https://www.cihalyon2024.fr/en/Created in 1873  the CIHA congresses take place every four years and are sometimes referred to colloquially as the “Olympiads of Art History”. The most recent congresses have been hosted in Melbourne (2008)  Nuremberg (2012)  Beijing (2016)  Florence and São Paulo (2019-2021)  and the next edition (after Lyon this year)  will be organized in Washington DC in 2028. On a global scale  the CIHA congresses constitute the most unifying event for the entire community of researchers and professionals in the world of art and cultural heritage.Organized by the French Art History Committee (CFHA) in partnership with the National Institute of Art History (INHA)  the Lumière University Lyon 2 and the Rhône-Alpes Historical Research Laboratory (LARHRA CNRS UMR 5190)  the 36th edition of this congress will take place at the Congress Center of the Cité Internationale in Lyon and will focus on a strong theme with connections to important societal issues: matter and materiality.This theme questions the very sources of art and delves into the conception  production  interpretation  and conservation of works of art from all cultures and all periods. It opens onto urgent questions linked to the most topical environmental and geopolitical issues: access to resources  sustainability  conservation  museums and ecological transition  dematerialization  destruction/reconstruction  war and heritage  and will include a session specifically devoted to Ukraine.thierry Ehrmann  CEO of Artmarket.com and founder of Artprice:“As one of its principal active patrons  Artprice is very happy to contribute to this global event  which is one of the most important for France and its international cultural policy. With participants from over 70 countries and more than 1000 speakers  this year's CIHA will be a superb intellectual complement to the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris. Indeed  this extraordinary quadrennial Art History Congress consolidates France's efforts to re-establish itself as an important cultural player on the international scene (according to Artprice's Annual Art Market Report  it is already the leading art marketplace in continental Europe). We will of course be very pleased to welcome CIHA delegates to the global headquarters of Artprice by Artmarket in the heart of the Contemporary Art Museum  La Demeure du Chaos / Abode of Chaos during an exceptional private evening.”Olivier Bonfait  President of the French Committee for the History of Art (CFHA)  organizer of the CIHA 2024:“By the quality and diversity of the planned discussions  the very high number of participants (more than 1500) and the international response it has received  this Art History Congress is already an important milestone in Art History. And  considering Artprice's contribution to Art History by enhancing art market transparency  their support of this Congress is a great honor and makes perfect sense. By participating in the International Congress in Lyon you are celebrating the importance of research and knowledge in the field of Art History.”The success of this major event is ensured by the strong commitment of the international community. The figures speak for themselves: 1500 registered participants  more than 1000 speakers from 70 countries.

42598,Euroclear,Bing API,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2024/06/13/g7-leaders-agree-50bn-loan-ukraine-russia-war/,Europe bows to US pressure to agree $50bn loan for Ukraine,European leaders bowed to American pressure and agreed a $50 billion loan deal for Ukraine on Thursday using the proceeds from frozen Russian assets...,Rishi Sunak  the Prime Minister  said the loan would be “game-changing” for Ukraine’s ability to ward off Russian attacks.“It’s fantastic news  it’s something that I personally and the UK have been leading on and championing for some time now ” he said.The deal came despite initial objections from Germany and Belgium  who had legal concerns about setting a precedent by using frozen assets to borrow.Berlin has been accused by some Western officials of hampering support for Ukraine in recent months  amid a row between politicians in the country’s ruling coalition about spending public money on the war.Berlin was concerned that seizing the money could open it up to more lawsuits demanding reparations for Nazi crimes in the Second World War  The Telegraph understands.Around $220 billion of frozen Russian assets are held in the Belgian securities depository  Euroclear. Brussels had opposed interfering with the sum in any way for fear of undermining its banking sector.The loan is the result of months of negotiation between G7 countries over how to use Russian assets frozen at the beginning of the war  most of which are in Europe.The US had originally proposed to send the full $320 billion directly to Kyiv  but this was blocked by EU leaders over fears of legal repercussions from the Kremlin.A second version of the plan  proposed by the EU  would have transferred the $5 billion annual interest earned from the assets to Ukraine while leaving the underlying capital untouched.The compromise agreed on Thursday will use the profits to secure a loan that will ultimately be guaranteed by the US Treasury  officials said.Ursula von Der Leyen  the president of the European Commission  said that all members of the G7 would contribute to the loan but the extent of each country’s participation was still to be worked out.‘Forward leaning’A Foreign Office source said: “It’s always been the case that us and the US have been most forward-leaning  needing to persuade the others.”US officials hope the loan plan will avoid a “tantrum” from Mr Zelensky at next month’s Nato summit in Washington DC  where Ukraine is not expected to be offered a concrete timeline for joining the alliance.At last year’s summit in Lithuania  Nato allies agreed to “extend an invitation to Ukraine to join the alliance when allies agree and conditions are met”. Mr Zelensky described the lack of a timeline as “unprecedented and absurd”.In Washington  Ukraine is set to be shown a “well-lit bridge” to membership  but no further assurances on when its request to join the alliance will be granted.The announcement of the loan came as the UK announced new sanctions on a “shadow fleet” of Russian tankers that have been used to circumvent British and G7 restrictions on oil exports.It follows months of concern about funding for Ukraine  which was held up in the US Congress until April amid objections from Republicans.Mr Zelensky warned that without a major cash injection from the West  he would be unable to fend off Russian missile attacks on civilians in cities this summer  nor retake territory lost since Vladimir Putin’s invasion.,negative,0.08,0.18,0.75,mixed,0.07,0.21,0.72,True,English,"['US pressure', '$50bn loan', 'Europe', 'Ukraine', 'Ursula von Der Leyen', 'Belgian securities depository', '$5 billion annual interest', 'Foreign Office source', 'major cash injection', 'Russian missile attacks', 'Second World War', 'Russian attacks', 'second version', 'Russian tankers', 'Rishi Sunak', 'Prime Minister', 'fantastic news', 'legal concerns', 'ruling coalition', 'Nazi crimes', 'The Telegraph', 'banking sector', 'legal repercussions', 'underlying capital', 'European Commission', 'Mr Zelensky', 'next month', 'last year', 'lit bridge', 'new sanctions', 'shadow fleet', 'oil exports', 'Vladimir Putin', 'Russian assets', 'The US', 'US Treasury', 'US Congress', 'frozen assets', 'Western officials', 'G7 countries', 'G7 restrictions', 'initial objections', 'public money', 'EU leaders', 'Nato summit', 'Washington DC', 'concrete timeline', 'Nato allies', 'US officials', 'recent months', 'loan plan', 'Ukraine', 'ability', 'something', 'deal', 'Germany', 'Belgium', 'precedent', 'Berlin', 'support', 'row', 'politicians', 'country', 'lawsuits', 'reparations', 'Euroclear', 'Brussels', 'way', 'fear', 'result', 'negotiation', 'beginning', 'full $3', 'Kyiv', 'Kremlin', 'compromise', 'Thursday', 'profits', 'president', 'members', 'extent', 'participation', 'case', 'others', 'tantrum', 'alliance', 'Lithuania', 'invitation', 'conditions', 'lack', 'assurances', 'request', 'announcement', 'British', 'funding', 'April', 'Republicans', 'civilians', 'cities', 'territory', 'invasion']",2024-06-13,2024-06-13,telegraph.co.uk

42601,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-13523443/STEPHEN-GLOVER-Brexit-Britain-Europe-hard-Right.html,STEPHEN GLOVER: What do all those stars who love to denigrate Brexit Britain have to say now their beloved Europe has fallen for the hard-Right?,Will the rise of the hard-Right in Europe lead progressives to question their conviction that civilisation thrives south of Calais  whereas Brexit Britain is narrow and inward-looking?,Will the rise of the hard-Right in Europe lead progressives to question their conviction that civilisation thrives south of Calais  whereas Brexit Britain is narrow  reactionary and inward-looking?Such prejudices are not new. For at least a hundred years  English intellectuals have looked longingly across the Channel in the belief that in almost every respect life is superior on the Continent.George Orwell wrote about the phenomenon in 1940  famously asserting that ‘England is perhaps the only great country whose intellectuals are ashamed of their own nationality’.He added  accurately  that ‘the English intelligentsia are Europeanized. They take their cookery from Paris and their opinions from Moscow’.Dame Emma Thompson  a fervent anti-Brexiteer  who before the 2016 referendum described Britain as a 'tiny  little  cloud-bolted  rainy… cake-filled  misery-laden  grey old island'Has anything changed? The war obviously put a slight dampener on the progressives’ certainty that  culturally and politically  Europe had much to teach dingy old Britain.Hitler in Germany and Mussolini in Italy — not to mention Stalinist Russia  Franco-ist Spain and Vichy France — rather punctured the view that European countries could be held up as exemplars of good governance.But after the war it didn’t take long for intellectuals — who  as Orwell pointed out  are overwhelmingly of the Left — to gaze covetously at Europe once more  and wherever possible to get into a car or jump on a train to enjoy its delights first-hand.Books by Elizabeth David about French and Italian cooking were snapped up by people who needed little persuading that English food was dull and tasteless  and far inferior to European cuisine. Roast beef and Yorkshire pudding was considered an abomination.Intellectuals lapped up Marxist continental writers such as Jean-Paul Sartre or Bertolt Brecht with an enthusiasm they could never quite summon for their home-grown counterparts.Let me stress that I love France and Italy  and revere their great art and beautiful architecture  though not their political systems. But such esteem hasn’t made me feel less affection for my own country  of which I have certainly never been ashamed.Not so the actress Dame Emma Thompson  a fervent anti-Brexiteer  who before the 2016 referendum described Britain as a ‘tiny  little  cloud-bolted  rainy… cake-filled  misery-laden  grey old island’. The poor woman has evidently never enjoyed a good Victoria Sponge or Dundee Cake!The actor Sir Ian McKellen was no less down on his own country  as well as awestruck by Europe  in the immediate aftermath of the referendum. He lamented: ‘Everything that’s good about being British is related to Europe.’ Surely some mistake  as the late Tory politician and journalist Bill Deedes might have said.Thompson and McKellen could have been speaking on behalf of generations of middle-class intellectuals who have deprecated their own land  and uncritically venerated all aspects of Europe.For years they have flocked to the Continent like homing pigeons. They may nest in ‘Chiantishire’ (a fictitious British enclave in Tuscany) unaware of the perennial political volatility in Italy  which in the 1970s exploded into far-Left and far-Right terrorism.Sir Ian McKellen also lamented: ‘Everything that’s good about being British is related to Europe'Or perhaps they have roosted in the Dordogne  a beautiful department in south-west France  and ignored the 1968 student uprising in Paris  which necessitated President Charles de Gaulle’s sudden flight from the French capital.Or conceivably (though Germany is a less popular venue for our itinerant intellectuals) they perched in the Rhine valley in the 1970s and 1980s  blissfully ignorant of the activities of the Baader-Meinhof Gang  which was responsible for bombings  assassinations  kidnappings and bank robberies.Britain seems tame by comparison. We’ve had our difficulties — I’m thinking of Islamist terrorism  also experienced by other European countries — but since the war  as before it  our politics have been calmer and less violent than those of other major European countries. Northern Ireland was an ugly tragedy  but the contagion barely spread to Britain.Might the virulent denigrators of this country concede that our constitutional monarchy and long history of parliamentary government have created an enduring stability that is sometimes absent in Europe? No! They will never admit that Britain has any intrinsic advantages over its neighbours.The success of the hard-Right over the weekend in European elections  in France  Germany  Italy and several other countries  wasn’t a bolt from the blue. It is a cancer that has been growing and spreading for years  so that in one month’s time there could be a hard-Right government in France.What do the intellectual detractors of Britain with funereal faces say now — the Thompsons and the McKellens  as well as novelists such as Julian Barnes and Ian McEwan  who decried Brexit as an act of stupidity and blind insularity? Do they give thanks for our dependable political arrangements? I have heard nothing.Believe me  I don’t rejoice that the hard-Right is on the march in Europe. But I am glad it’s still only on the fringes in Britain. Nigel Farage can’t be equated with Marine Le Pen in France  or even the slightly more moderate Giorgia Meloni in Italy. We aren’t about to catch Europe’s disease. The worst we have to fear is the stolid  rather boring  democratic socialist  Sir Keir Starmer.As I say  our political institutions have deep roots. We are also not cursed with proportional representation  which inevitably gives a bigger voice to radical parties of Left and Right. An unlikely alliance of Farage  the Lib Dems and the Green Party wants to get rid of first-past-the-post  the very system that offers protection against extremists.But I believe there’s something deeper — a tolerance and sense of fairness  remarked upon by Orwell  that distinguishes the British from other races. Many people are furious about uncontrolled immigration  and understandably so  but they haven’t turned to the hard-Right. Let’s pray they never do. Our rainy little island that supposedly owes everything to Europe turns out to be more stable  more grounded in its democratic ways  than most of the countries the other side of the Channel.Zealous anti-Brexiteers will never admit as much  of course. Nor will they recognise that the economic fortunes of Germany  France and Italy are worse than our own. The other day  the head of Deutsche Borse  a huge German multi-national  declared that Germany is little more than ‘a developing country’. An exaggeration  of course  but one sees his point.Brexit hasn’t ruined the UK economy  though you would think it had if you relied solely on the Financial Times  Guardian or BBC. In 2021  Britain was ranked the seventh-largest exporter in the world by the UN Conference on Trade and Development. It now stands in fourth place  following rapid growth in the export of services.Point this out next time you are abroad and a well-meaning foreigner  influenced by wrong-headed British progressive intellectuals who in the long tradition of their kind run this country down  looks pityingly into your eyes and offers to send you a food parcel.The sub-text of this election campaign is that Britain is a crumbling  depressed  dysfunctional country in urgent need of emergency surgery.Believe that if you will. But when I look across the Channel  and see a rampant hard-Right and economies dickier than our own  I can only count our blessings.,neutral,0.14,0.47,0.39,mixed,0.14,0.24,0.62,True,English,"['STEPHEN GLOVER', 'Brexit Britain', 'beloved Europe', 'stars', 'hard-Right', 'tiny, little, cloud-bolted, rainy', 'President Charles de Gaulle', 'misery-laden, grey old island', 'other major European countries', 'several other countries', 'Marxist continental writers', 'late Tory politician', 'journalist Bill Deedes', 'fictitious British enclave', 'other European countries', 'good Victoria Sponge', 'perennial political volatility', 'Dame Emma Thompson', 'dingy old Britain', 'Sir Ian McKellen', 'a hundred years', 'Ian McEwan', 'European cuisine', 'European elections', 'good governance', 'political systems', 'Such prejudices', 'English intelligentsia', 'fervent anti-Brexiteer', 'slight dampener', 'Stalinist Russia', 'Franco-ist Spain', 'Elizabeth David', 'Italian cooking', 'English food', 'Roast beef', 'Yorkshire pudding', 'Jean-Paul Sartre', 'Bertolt Brecht', 'home-grown counterparts', 'great art', 'beautiful architecture', 'less affection', 'poor woman', 'Dundee Cake', 'immediate aftermath', 'Right terrorism', 'beautiful department', '1968 student uprising', 'sudden flight', 'popular venue', 'Rhine valley', 'Baader-Meinhof Gang', 'bank robberies', 'Islamist terrorism', 'Northern Ireland', 'ugly tragedy', 'virulent denigrators', 'constitutional monarchy', 'long history', 'parliamentary government', 'enduring stability', 'intrinsic advantages', 'one month', 'intellectual detractors', 'funereal faces', 'Julian Barnes', 'English intellectuals', 'George Orwell', 'progressives’ certainty', 'middle-class intellectuals', 'French capital', 'itinerant intellectuals', 'hard-Right government', 'Vichy France', 'south-west France', 'great country', 'Brexit Britain', 'rise', 'conviction', 'civilisation', 'Calais', 'Channel', 'belief', 'respect', 'life', 'phenomenon', 'England', 'nationality', 'cookery', 'Paris', 'opinions', 'Moscow', '2016 referendum', 'cake-filled', 'war', 'Hitler', 'Germany', 'Mussolini', 'Italy', 'view', 'exemplars', 'Left', 'car', 'train', 'delights', 'Books', 'people', 'abomination', 'enthusiasm', 'esteem', 'actress', 'awestruck', 'Everything', 'mistake', 'behalf', 'generations', 'aspects', 'pigeons', 'Chiantishire', 'Tuscany', '1970s', 'Dordogne', '1980s', 'activities', 'bombings', 'assassinations', 'kidnappings', 'difficulties', 'politics', 'contagion', 'neighbours', 'success', 'weekend', 'blue', 'cancer', 'time', 'Thompsons', 'McKellens', 'novelists', 'stupidity', 'insularity', 'thanks', 'dependable']",2024-06-13,2024-06-13,dailymail.co.uk

SCD is caused by a single point mutation in the HBB gene  which encodes the β subunit of hemoglobin (Hb). Normally  red blood cells adopt a disc-like shape that allows them to move easily through the blood vessels and deliver oxygen throughout the body. In sickle cell disease  red blood cells become crescent or ""sickle""-shaped  a dysfunctional state that impairs blood flow  oxygen delivery and triggers multiple debilitating symptoms including intense pain crisis.Cellectis leverages TALEN® technology and a non-viral gene repair template delivery to develop a clinically relevant gene editing process in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). This process enables efficient HBB gene correction with high precision  specificity and minimal genomic adverse events.Applying this HBB gene correction process to SCD patient-HSPCs results in over 50% expression of normal adult hemoglobin in mature red blood cells and in the correction of sickle phenotype  without inducing β-thalassemic phenotype. Edited HSPCs engraft efficiently in an immunodeficient murine model and maintain clinically relevant levels of HBB gene correction events. This comprehensive preclinical data package sets the stage for the therapeutic application of autologous gene corrected HSPCs to address SCD.""The unique combination of TALEN® technology  non-viral DNA repair template design and Cellectis' PulseAgile proprietary electroporation system enabled us to set up a precise  efficient and clinically relevant HBB gene correction process in long term hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from SCD patients"" said Julien Valton  Ph.D.  Vice President Gene Therapy at Cellectis. ""SCD is a devastating blood disorder affecting millions of individuals worldwide. The TALEN® gene therapy approach could represent a new alternative treatment  especially for patients with limited therapeutic options. This gene editing process bears a strong therapeutic potential as it could be easily used to correct point mutations associated to many other genetic diseases.""Research data showed that:TALEN ® technology  coupled to non-viral DNA correction template delivery  achieves high HBB gene correction efficiencies in healthy donor - and SCD patient - HSPCs in vitro.technology  coupled to non-viral DNA correction template delivery  achieves high HBB gene correction efficiencies in healthy donor - and SCD patient - HSPCs in vitro. HBB gene correction translates into an efficient rescue of functional Adult Hemoglobin (HbA) and a significant decrease of dysfunctional Sickle Hemoglobin (HbS) and Sickle red blood cells.TALEN ® nuclease activity is highly specific with only one off-target site detected at the HBD locus.nuclease activity is highly specific with only one off-target site detected at the HBD locus. Corrected HSPCs display long-term in vivo engraftment capacity in murine animal model  indicating their strong potential for therapeutic applications towards SCD.The article is available on Nature Communications website by clicking on this link:https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-49353-3About CellectisCellectis is a clinical-stage biotechnology company using its pioneering gene-editing platform to develop life-saving cell and gene therapies.

SCD is caused by a single point mutation in the HBB gene  which encodes the β subunit of hemoglobin (Hb). Normally  red blood cells adopt a disc-like shape that allows them to move easily through the blood vessels and deliver oxygen throughout the body. In sickle cell disease  red blood cells become crescent or “sickle”-shaped  a dysfunctional state that impairs blood flow  oxygen delivery and triggers multiple debilitating symptoms including intense pain crisis.Cellectis leverages TALEN® technology and a non-viral gene repair template delivery to develop a clinically relevant gene editing process in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs). This process enables efficient HBB gene correction with high precision  specificity and minimal genomic adverse events.Applying this HBB gene correction process to SCD patient-HSPCs results in over 50% expression of normal adult hemoglobin in mature red blood cells and in the correction of sickle phenotype  without inducing β-thalassemic phenotype. Edited HSPCs engraft efficiently in an immunodeficient murine model and maintain clinically relevant levels of HBB gene correction events. This comprehensive preclinical data package sets the stage for the therapeutic application of autologous gene corrected HSPCs to address SCD.“The unique combination of TALEN® technology  non-viral DNA repair template design and Cellectis’ PulseAgile proprietary electroporation system enabled us to set up a precise  efficient and clinically relevant HBB gene correction process in long term hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells from SCD patients” said Julien Valton  Ph.D.  Vice President Gene Therapy at Cellectis. “SCD is a devastating blood disorder affecting millions of individuals worldwide. The TALEN® gene therapy approach could represent a new alternative treatment  especially for patients with limited therapeutic options. This gene editing process bears a strong therapeutic potential as it could be easily used to correct point mutations associated to many other genetic diseases.”Research data showed that:TALEN ® technology  coupled to non-viral DNA correction template delivery  achieves high HBB gene correction efficiencies in healthy donor - and SCD patient - HSPCs in vitro.technology  coupled to non-viral DNA correction template delivery  achieves high HBB gene correction efficiencies in healthy donor - and SCD patient - HSPCs in vitro. HBB gene correction translates into an efficient rescue of functional Adult Hemoglobin (HbA) and a significant decrease of dysfunctional Sickle Hemoglobin (HbS) and Sickle red blood cells.TALEN ® nuclease activity is highly specific with only one off-target site detected at the HBD locus.nuclease activity is highly specific with only one off-target site detected at the HBD locus. Corrected HSPCs display long-term in vivo engraftment capacity in murine animal model  indicating their strong potential for therapeutic applications towards SCD.The article is available on Nature Communications website by clicking on this link:https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-49353-3About CellectisCellectis is a clinical-stage biotechnology company using its pioneering gene-editing platform to develop life-saving cell and gene therapies.

Key target indications for the autoimmune platform include graft-versus-host-disease (GvHD)  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  and now systemic sclerosis (SSc).Following the merger in October 2022  BioSenic combined the strategic positionings and strengths of Medsenic and Bone Therapeutics. The merger specifically enables Medsenic/Biosenic to develop an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/oral ATO (OATO).BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About the main Medsenic/BioSenic technology platformThe ATO platform provides derived active products with immunomodulatory properties and fundamental effects on the activated cells of the immune system. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. cGvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT).Medsenic has been successful in a phase 2 trial with its intravenous formulation  Arscimed®  which has orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA. The company is heading towards an international phase 3 confirmatory study  with its new  IP-protected  OATO formulation. Another selected target is moderate-to-severe forms of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae  and the gastrointestinal tract). Systemic sclerosis is now full part of the clinical pipeline of Medsenic/BioSenic. This serious chronic disease badly affects skin  lungs  or vascularization  and has no current effective treatment. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive  giving good grounds to launch a phase 2 clinical protocol  using new immunomodulatory formulations of APIs recognized to be active on the immune system.The company is currently focusing its present R&D and clinical activities on a selective  accelerated development of its autoimmune platform.Note: The allogeneic cell therapy platform-originating from the previous listed company Bone Therapeutics company  may be of renewed interest by using isolated and purified differentiated bone marrow Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) as a starting material for further isolation of passive or active biological subcellular elements. Indeed  these cells may provide new subcellular vesicles potentially able to deliver a unique and proprietary approach to organ repair. BioSenic is now involved in determining new patentable approaches in this complex area of cell therapy.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAFrançois Rieger  PhD  CEOTel: +33 (0)671 73 31 59investorrelations@biosenic.comCertain statements  beliefs and opinions in this press release are forward-looking  which reflect the company or  as appropriate  the company directors’ current expectations and projections about future events.

These documents demonstrate the profound impact of its new management team and corporate repositioning.When new management was appointed and assumed board responsibilities on 5 June 2023  they inherited substantial Q1 and Q2 losses driven by legacy operational and financing practices. Tonner Drones’ newly installed task-force team led the organization through a comprehensive restructuring and refinancing period  driving down the €8 83M losses experienced in the first half of 2023 by almost 79%  to €1 92M in the second half.(000’s) 2023 2022 Change Net Sales 1.080 0.341 + 217% Net Result (10.748) (24.650) - 56%While the iterative improvements to the financial wellbeing of the company are remarkable  Tonner Drones’ management team recognizes the substantial losses experienced in 2022 and 2023. Tonner Drones assures its investors that the painful legacy left by its former management and creditors will not be repeated  and that this difficult period will not define the organization’s future.Additionally  Tonner Drones has successfully negotiated the lifting of all variable price financing instruments held by Fiducie A1 and Yorkville.2 The total company debt as of 5 June 2024 is estimated at €4 6M. The estimated debt held by Fiducie A is now just under €1M and is expected to be terminated in October of 2024.Tonner Drones further demonstrated its decoupling from the past through its successful capital increase of €5M in April 2024.

The bondholders will also benefit from a redemption right  during a period of 30 calendar days from the third anniversary of the Issue  if the Company has sufficient cash available to redeem the Convertible Bonds at their par value plus accrued interest not yet paid. Going concern statement Before settlement of the Issue  the Company does not have sufficient working capital to satisfy its obligations for the next 12 months. As of April 30  2024  the Company's cash position was €30 million. Before completion of the Issue  the Company estimates that it will have sufficient working capital to satisfy its obligations until September 2024 and that its net cash requirements for the next 12 months amount to approximately €42 million  without taking into account the financing measures listed below. Following settlement of the Issue  the Company will not have sufficient working capital to satisfy its obligations for the next 12 months but only until February 2025. Following completion of the Issue and in order to finance its activities  its net cash requirements are estimated at €13 million for the next 12 months. This estimate does not take into account the financing measures amounting to a total of approximately €30 million  for which the Company benefits from the following binding commitments and which are as follows: the sale of the station business that should occur during the 2 nd quarter 2024 for a net cash inflow of approximately €11 million by end 2025 (subject to completion of financing by Atawey);quarter 2024 for a net cash inflow of approximately €11 million by end 2025 (subject to completion of financing by Atawey); the implementation by end July 2024 of a lease financing for the Belfort Gigafactory (being precised that a binding agreement notice has been signed on February 29  2024 with a banking pool for an amount of approximately €16 million); andthe potential use of the equity line implemented with Vester Finance on December 19  2023 (depending on market conditions and on the respect of exercise conditions). If one of the financing measures abovementioned were to fail  the Company could be required to seek other sources of financing  in debt or in equity  in order to complete its working capital and to finance its operating expenses beyond February 2025. Based on the financing measures abovementioned and the net proceeds of the issue of approximately €29.5 million  the Company considers that it will have the required financial resources to finance its growth and working capital requirements until the beginning of 2026 on its scope refocused on the electrolyzer business. | Page 3 on 8Press release | 12-06-2024 | © McPhy Energy S.A. NOT TO BE DIFFUSED  PUBLISHED OR DISTRIBUTED  DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY  IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA  CANADA  SOUTH AFRICA  JAPAN OR AUSTRALIA Legal framework of the Issue The Company's board of directors held on May 30  2024 has authorized the principle of the Convertible Bonds issue and delegated its powers to the chief executive officer to decide the Issue and set the definitive terms and conditions of the Convertible Bonds  in accordance with the delegations granted by the 30th and 31st resolutions of the combined general meeting held on May 30  2024 (the ""EGM"") related to the issuances of securities reserved for designated persons  in accordance with article L.225-138 of the French Commercial Code. It is specified that Bpifrance Investissement SAS  represented by Ms Laure Michel and EDF Pulse Holding SAS  represented by Ms Christelle Rouillé  have not participated to the vote of this decision at the board of directors. The chief executive officer has decided the Issue and set the final terms of the Convertible Bonds by a decision dated June 11  2024. Financial intermediary Bryan  Garnier & Co. acted as financial advisor in connection with the Issue. Risk factors The risks specific to the Issue are as follows: the Company's shareholders will suffer dilution as a result of the issue of the new shares: existing shareholders (other than those participating in the Issue) will suffer significant dilution of their interest in the Company's share capital as a result of the Issue of the new shares that may be issued following conversion of the Convertible Bonds  insofar as the Issue will be carried out without preferential subscription rights for the benefit of certain designated investors;sales of the Company's shares could occur on the market and have an unfavorable impact on the Company's share price: given the very large number of new shares likely to be issued  sales of the Company's shares could occur rapidly from the date of completion of the issues  or such sales could be anticipated by the market  which could have an unfavorable impact on the trading price of the share. The Company cannot predict the possible effects on the trading price of the shares sold by its shareholders;the volatility and liquidity of the Company's shares could fluctuate significantly: stock markets have experienced significant fluctuations in recent years  often unrelated to the results of the companies whose shares are traded. Market fluctuations and economic conditions could increase the volatility of the Company's shares. The market price of the Company's shares could fluctuate significantly in response to various factors and events  including the risk factors described in the Company's 2023 Universal Registration Document (as modified by an amendment filed with the AMF on June 12  2024) and the liquidity of the market for the Company's shares; andthe Company may not be able to pay interest and/or to redeem the Convertible Bonds : it cannot be guaranteed that the Company will have sufficient cash to enable payment of the nominal value and/or interest related to the Convertible Bonds on the dates they become due. In addition  the terms and conditions of the Convertible Bonds include usual early redemption clauses for this type of bonds. It cannot be guaranteed that the Company will have sufficient resources to face an early redemption of the Convertible Bonds. It is also reminded that pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Convertible Bonds  the Company has committed to not grant any pledge  liens or security under any existing or future indebtedness unless the Convertible Bonds benefit from the same treatment pari-passu  subject to usual exemptions. | Page 4 on 8Press release | 12-06-2024 | © McPhy Energy S.A. NOT TO BE DIFFUSED  PUBLISHED OR DISTRIBUTED  DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY  IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA  CANADA  SOUTH AFRICA  JAPAN OR AUSTRALIA The main risks specific to the Company are described in section 2.1 of the universal registration document for 2023 filed with the AMF under number D.24-0348  as updated by the amendment that filed with the AMF on June 12  2024 under number D24-0348-A01 (together the ""2023 Universal Registration Document"")  and include in particular: risks related to its strategy  and in particular to the low-carbon hydrogen market and the development of existing solutions or the emergence of new competing technologies;low-carbon hydrogen market and the development of existing solutions or the emergence of new competing technologies; risks related to its business  particularly product development; andrisks relating to the Group's financial situation  and in particular to its medium- and long-term profitability and to its liquidity and uncertain additional financings. Dilution A shareholder holding 1% of the share capital prior to the Issue would hold 0.78% of share capital (on a non- diluted basis) if the Company decided to issue only new shares in case of exercise of the Conversion and/or Exchange Right of all the Convertible Bonds issued. Lock-up commitment In connection with the Issue  the Company has made a commitment to refrain from issuing or transferring shares or instruments giving access to the Company's share capital for a period commencing on the Issue Date and ending 90 calendar days after the Issue Date  subject to the issue of new shares on exercise of the share warrants under the financing facility entered into with Vester Finance3 and certain customary exceptions. Governance In connection with EDF Pulse's subscription to the Issue  the EGM has decided to appoint Mr. Régis Combaluzier  an individual proposed by EDF Pulse Holding  as an independent director holding a voting right on the Company's Board of directors  subject to the condition precedent and with effect from the settlement of the Issue and for a term of two years. Admission to trading The Convertible Bonds will not be subject to an application for admission to trading on any market (regulated or otherwise). The new shares that may be issued following conversion of the Convertible Bonds will be (i) ordinary shares of the same class as the Company's existing shares  (ii) immediately assimilated to the Company's existing shares  already traded on Euronext Paris and tradable  as from this date  on the same listing line as these shares under the same ISIN code FR0011742329 and will carry current dividend rights as from their delivery date. 3 See the Company's Press Release of December 19  2023 ""McPhy renews an equity financing line with Vester Finance"" | Page 5 on 8Press release | 12-06-2024 | © McPhy Energy S.A.

Precision fermentation is a revolutionary biotechnological process to produce bio-based materials and ingredients.With an investment of over 16 million euro in the first phase  the industrial and technological platform will be located in Clermont-Ferrand within the Parc Cataroux Center for Sustainable Materials  an innovation accelerator supported by Michelin. The Biotech Open Platform is also supported by several public and private institutions: the University of Clermont Auvergne  the company Greentech  the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes Region under the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and Clermont Auvergne Métropole.As industry looks for alternatives to fossil-based resources  it is turning to innovative and sustainable solutions to meet its supply needs while providing more efficient materials. Biotechnology - and particularly precision fermentation - is one of the most promising ways to meet this challenge. Precision fermentation is a cutting-edge technology that uses microorganisms like bacteria  yeast or fungi to produce proteins  enzymes and other molecules that are used in industry. It is particularly suited to innovation in the agri-food and materials sectors. Although fundamental research has made considerable progress  biotechnologies must now be developed on a larger scale.The Biotech Open Platform's ambition is to accelerate the development of precision fermentation by enabling the scale-up of innovative products and processes already tested in the laboratory. By 2025  the project plans to install an initial demo-scale production line  including a fermenter and purification equipment. Additional equipment will be installed in the following years  including a second production line. This ramp-up will enable the platform to meet the scale-up needs of its founders and to gradually open it up to other companies facing the challenge of scaling up in the industrial biomanufacturing sector.Florent Menegaux  President of the Michelin group: “ The Michelin group is pleased to announce the creation  with its partners  of the Biotech Open Platform – a unique tool that will enhance the development of bio-sourced materials  a key challenge for the industry of tomorrow. Located in Auvergne  it exemplifies Michelin’s unflagging commitment to developing innovation and the regions where the Group operates.""Antoine de Saint-Affrique  CEO of Danone: “At Danone  we have always been focused on investing in the future of food  and this partnership is the next step in this journey. We look forward to working with our partners to develop cutting-edge fermentation technologies which will accelerate innovation  health benefits and decarbonization in the food industry. We are proud to be part of this collective effort and to strengthen our contribution to meet the challenges facing the industry today.""Kenny Erdoes  CEO of DMC: “We are enthusiastic about this new partnership with companies that are at the heart of French life. For us  as an American start-up  the development of the new Biotech Open Platform will enable us to accelerate the scale-up and commercialization of new products leveraging our transformative fermentation technology.""Frédéric Baraut  CEO of Crédit Agricole Centre France: “Crédit Agricole Centre France is taking steps to support transformation and innovation in the region. By contributing to the Biotech Open Platform  we are helping to develop a new bio-based sector based in Clermont-Ferrand and also adding to the value and the attractiveness of the region. This will also help provide opportunities and synergies to the start-ups in our Innovation Village  also in the Parc Cataroux.”Press contactsMichelin / Center for Sustainable Materials: Pascale Audibert - pascale.audibert@michelin.com /+336 34 09 82 67 – Michelin group media relations: + 33 1 45 66 22 22 - X : @MichelinNewsDanone: press@danone.comDMC Biotechnologies: Kathryn Sheridan - kathryn@dmcbio.comCrédit Agricole Centre France: Isabelle Dugat - isabelle.dugat@ca-centrefrance.fr / +33 4 73 30 58 89About the Center for Sustainable MaterialsThe Center for Sustainable Materials is one of the four centers of Parc Cataroux  the only regeneration project of its kind in Europe dedicated to innovation in all its forms.

Artprice is an active sponsor of the International Congress of Art History (CIHA) which this year will be attended by well over a thousand researchers from over 70 countries (June 23 to 28)In a few days  the 36th edition of the International Congress of Art History (CIHA) will open at the Lyon Convention Center (June 23 to 28). This is a very exceptional event that will not be repeated in France for several decades.https://www.cihalyon2024.fr/en/Created in 1873  the CIHA congresses take place every four years and are sometimes referred to colloquially as the “Olympiads of Art History”. The most recent congresses have been hosted in Melbourne (2008)  Nuremberg (2012)  Beijing (2016)  Florence and São Paulo (2019-2021)  and the next edition (after Lyon this year)  will be organized in Washington DC in 2028. On a global scale  the CIHA congresses constitute the most unifying event for the entire community of researchers and professionals in the world of art and cultural heritage.Organized by the French Art History Committee (CFHA) in partnership with the National Institute of Art History (INHA)  the Lumière University Lyon 2 and the Rhône-Alpes Historical Research Laboratory (LARHRA CNRS UMR 5190)  the 36th edition of this congress will take place at the Congress Center of the Cité Internationale in Lyon and will focus on a strong theme with connections to important societal issues: matter and materiality.This theme questions the very sources of art and delves into the conception  production  interpretation  and conservation of works of art from all cultures and all periods. It opens onto urgent questions linked to the most topical environmental and geopolitical issues: access to resources  sustainability  conservation  museums and ecological transition  dematerialization  destruction/reconstruction  war and heritage  and will include a session specifically devoted to Ukraine.thierry Ehrmann  CEO of Artmarket.com and founder of Artprice:“As one of its principal active patrons  Artprice is very happy to contribute to this global event  which is one of the most important for France and its international cultural policy. With participants from over 70 countries and more than 1000 speakers  this year's CIHA will be a superb intellectual complement to the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris. Indeed  this extraordinary quadrennial Art History Congress consolidates France's efforts to re-establish itself as an important cultural player on the international scene (according to Artprice's Annual Art Market Report  it is already the leading art marketplace in continental Europe). We will of course be very pleased to welcome CIHA delegates to the global headquarters of Artprice by Artmarket in the heart of the Contemporary Art Museum  La Demeure du Chaos / Abode of Chaos during an exceptional private evening.”Olivier Bonfait  President of the French Committee for the History of Art (CFHA)  organizer of the CIHA 2024:“By the quality and diversity of the planned discussions  the very high number of participants (more than 1500) and the international response it has received  this Art History Congress is already an important milestone in Art History. And  considering Artprice's contribution to Art History by enhancing art market transparency  their support of this Congress is a great honor and makes perfect sense. By participating in the International Congress in Lyon you are celebrating the importance of research and knowledge in the field of Art History.”The success of this major event is ensured by the strong commitment of the international community. The figures speak for themselves: 1500 registered participants  more than 1000 speakers from 70 countries. More than 90 sessions  10 major conferences  plus numerous round tables  dialogues and meetings.The Congress's opening speech will be delivered by the Turkish Nobel Prize laureate  author  Orhan Pamuk.

Section B - Key information on the Issuer Who is the issuer of the securities? 1. Domicile/Legal The Issuer is a public company incorporated and registered in Jersey Form/Country under the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 (as amended) with registered number 103518. of Incorporation: 2. Principal The principal activity of the Issuer is issuing several classes of Activities Collateralised Currency Securities. The Collateralised Currency Securities are designed to provide exposure to movements in indices calculated and published by Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC which track movements in different exchange rates (the ""Currency Indices"" or ""MSFXSM Indices""). The Issuer gains exposure to the movements in Currency Indices by entering into unfunded collateralised derivative contracts (the ""Currency Transactions""). Payments under Currency Transactions vary (before any applicable fees) by reference to changes to the Currency Indices. The Collateralised Currency Securities are also backed by the collateral (the ""Collateral"") in accounts of the Issuer at The Bank of New York Mellon (""BONY""). The operation of those accounts is governed by the terms of (i) a custody agreement between the Issuer and BONY (the ""Custody Agreement""); and (ii) a collateral administration master agreement between the Issuer and BONY (the ""Collateral Administration Agreement"") as supplemented by a ""Supplemental Agreement"" between the Issuer and BONY. Any cash received by the Issuer on the issue of Collateralised Currency Securities or under the terms of the Currency Transactions (which is not required to make payments to Security Holders on redemption) is used to purchase assets as collateral from MSIP (defined below) under the terms of an agreement between the Issuer and MSIP dated 5 November 2009 and entitled ""Global Master Repurchase Agreement"" or ""Repo"". 3. Major The shares in the Issuer are held entirely by WisdomTree Holdings shareholders Jersey Limited (""HoldCo"")  a holding company incorporated in Jersey. The shares in HoldCo are ultimately owned by WisdomTree  Inc. The Issuer is neither directly or indirectly owned or controlled by any other party to the programme. 4.

Investors in Collateralised Currency Securities may lose the value of their entire investment or part of it. An investor's potential loss is limited to the amount of the investor's investment. The Issuer has been established as a special purpose vehicle for the purpose of issuing the Collateralised Currency Securities and has no assets other than those attributable to the Collateralised Currency Securities. No member of the Morgan Stanley Group of any other person has guaranteed the Issuer's obligations. The ability of the Issuer to meet its obligations in relation to Collateralised Currency Securities will be wholly dependent on its receipt of payments under Currency Transactions from Currency Transaction Counterparties and its ability to sell the Collateral under the Repo to MSIP. The amounts that a Security Holder could receive following a claim against the Issuer are  therefore  limited to the proceeds of realisation of the secured property applicable to such Security Holder's class of Collateralised Currency Securities and as the Issuer is a special purpose vehicle formed only for the purpose of issuing the Collateralised Currency Securities  and as the Collateralised Currency Securities are not guaranteed by any other person  the Issuer would have no further assets against which the Security Holder could claim. In the event that the proceeds of realisation of the secured property is insufficient to cover the amount payable to the Security Holder  the Security Holder would suffer a loss. Although Collateralised Currency Securities are secured by the Collateral  the value of such Collateralised Currency Securities and the ability of the Issuer to pay any redemption amounts remains partly dependent on the receipt of amounts due from the relevant Currency Transaction Counterparty under the Facility Agreement  the ISDA Master Agreement and the Repo. At the date of this Prospectus  there is one Currency Transaction Counterparty (MSIP) which is the obligor. There can be no assurance that MSIP  any other Currency Transaction Counterparty or any other entity will be able to fulfill their payment obligations under the relevant Currency Transactions  Facility Agreement  ISDA Master Agreement or Repo. Consequently  there can be no assurance that the Issuer will be able to redeem Collateralised Currency Securities at their redemption price which could lead to an investor receiving less than the redemption price upon redemption of their Collateralised Currency Securities. Section C - Key information on the Securities What are the main features of the securities? 1. Offer Price 66.9210618 GBP 2. The Index MSFXSM Triple Long US Dollar/GBP Index(TR) 3. Leverage Factor an exposure to 3 times the movements in a foreign exchange rate of a currency versus GBP  EUR or USD (such that if the currency strengthens versus the GBP  EUR or USD on a particular day then the value of the Collateralised Currency Security will increase on a three times leveraged basis) plus 3 times the interest rate differential between those two currencies. 4. Currency The Collateralised Currency Securities being issued pursuant to the Final Terms are denominated in GBP 5. Minimum denomination Each Collateralised Currency Security has a face value known as a ""Principal Amount"" as follows: • For Collateralised Currency Securities denominated in US Dollars the Principal Amount is US$1. • For Collateralised Currency Securities denominated in Euros the Principal Amount is €1. • For Collateralised Currency Securities denominated in Pounds Sterling the Principal Amount is £1. Issue specific summary: Class of Collateralised GBP Developed Market Currency Security Currency Securities - WisdomTree Long USD Short GBP 3x Daily Principal Amount GBP 1 6. Restrictions on transfer Not applicable; the Collateralised Currency Securities are freely transferable. 7. Rights A Collateralised Currency Security entitles a Security Holder to require the Issuer to redeem their security in return for payment of the higher of (i) the minimum denomination for that class of Collateralised Currency Security (known as the ""Principal Amount""); and (ii) the price of that class of that Collateralised Currency Security on the applicable day determined using the formula set out in element C.15 below. Generally only Authorised Participants will deal directly with the Issuer in redeeming Collateralised Currency Securities. In circumstances  where there are no Authorised Participants  or as the Issuer may in its sole discretion determine  Security Holders who are not Authorised Participants may require the Issuer to redeem their securities directly. Limited Recourse The obligations of the Issuer in respect of each class of Collateralised Currency Securities are secured by a charge in favour of the Trustee and an assignment to the Trustee by way of security of the Issuer's rights in so far as they relate to that class. The Trustee and the Security Holders of any class of Collateralised Currency Securities shall have recourse only to the sums derived from the assets relating to that class. If the net proceeds are insufficient for the Issuer to make all payments due  the Trustee or any other person acting on behalf of the Trustee  will not be entitled to take any further steps against the Issuer and no debt shall be owed by the Issuer in respect of such further sum. Priority of Payments All moneys received by the Trustee upon realisation of the assets relevant to a particular class of Collateralised Currency Securities will be held on trust by the Trustee and applied in the following order: Payments due to the Trustee (and persons appointed by the Trustee) and payments due to any receiver and the costs of realisation of the security;Payments or performance of all amounts due and unpaid and all obligations due in respect of Collateralised Currency Securities of that class; andIn payment of the balance (if any) to the Issuer. Issue Specific Summary The Principal Amount and class of each of the Collateralised Currency Securities being issued pursuant to the Final Terms is as follows: Class of Collateralised WisdomTree Long USD Short Currency Security GBP 3x Daily Principal Amount GBP 1 Where will the securities be traded? 8. Application has been made for the Collateralised Currency Securities being issued pursuant to the Final Terms to trading on the Main Market of the London Stock Exchange. What are the key risks that are specific to the securities? Although Collateralised Currency Securities are backed (among other things) by the Collateral  there is no guarantee that if realised it would produce sufficient value to cover the Issuer's obligations to Security Holders. In addition  in the event that the Security Trustee has to enforce the relevant Security Deed  proceeds from the enforcement of the Security Deed will be applied by the Security Trustee in accordance with the Priority Waterfall. Security Holders rank behind the Security Trustee  the Trustee and MSIP (in respect of such MSIP's claims under the Facility Agreement  the ISDA Master Agreement and the Repo) in the Priority Waterfall. Following the priority of payments  the remaining proceeds from enforcement may be insufficient to cover the full redemption amount due from the Issuer to Security Holders. In both cases Security Holders may be affected as a result  by receiving less than they would otherwise expect upon the redemption of their Collateralised Currency Securities. If the price of any class of Collateralised Currency Security (less any applicable additional redemption fee) falls below 5 times the Principal Amount of such class  the Issuer may  at any time for so long as the price (less  any applicable additional redemption fee) remains below 5 times the Principal Amount upon no less than two days' notice by regulatory information service announcement  elect to redeem the Collateralised Currency Securities of that class which may result in an investment in Collateralised Currency Securities being redeemed earlier than desired and at short notice. In these circumstances  the Security Holder may suffer a loss if the cash value of the Collateralised Currency Securities are redeemed at a price lower than it would otherwise have been had the Security Holder's investment been redeemed on a day chosen by the Security Holder rather than on the date of the early redemption. Early redemption could also lead to a Security Holder incurring a tax charge that it would otherwise not be subject to and/or if the redemption takes place at a time when the cash value of the Collateralised Currency Securities redeemed is lower than when they were purchased by the Security Holder  the Security Holder could suffer a loss. The Issuer has no obligation to exercise any of these rights and as a result the Price may fall below the Principal Amount. The Price may fall to zero in some circumstances. Issue specific summary: The following risk factors apply to the class of Collateralised Currency Securities being issued pursuant to the Final Terms: Investing in Collateralised Currency Securities which track a leveraged Currency Index is riskier since leveraged Currency Indices adjust by two  three or five times the exposure of corresponding non leveraged Currency Indices. The return of Collateralised Currency Securities which are short or leveraged can be different to the return provided by non-leveraged Collateralised Currency Securities for periods greater than one day. Investors in Collateralised Currency Securities may lose the value of their entire investment or part of it: Exchange rates can be highly volatile and therefore the value of Collateralised Currency Securities may fluctuate widely and Collateralised Currency Securities which provide exposure to Currency Indices tracking the exchange rates of emerging markets may be more exposed to the risk of swift political change and economic downturns than their industrialised counterparties. In both cases this could lead to a loss for investors if the price falls rapidly to a level lower than that at which they purchased securities. In certain circumstances the value of a Collateralised Currency Security may fall to zero and so become subject to a Compulsory Redemption. In these circumstances Security Holders may receive no payment on redemption. Section D - Key information on the offer of securities to the public and/or the admission to trading on a regulated market 1.

Upon redemption by an Authorised Participant (and in certain limited circumstances  other Security Holders)  the Issuer must deliver an amount of cash to the redeeming Security Holder equal to the price of the Collateralised Currency Securities to be redeemed in return for delivery by the redeeming Security Holder of the Collateralised Currency Securities to be redeemed via CREST. Cash held by the Issuer (other than that required to meet redemptions or that which reflects accrued but unpaid management fees) is delivered to the Currency Transaction Counterparty in return for delivery by the Currency Transaction Counterparty of Collateral of the same value to an account of the Issuer at the Collateral Administrator. If the Issuer is required to pay any amounts (i) to MSIP under the Currency Transactions; or (ii) to an Authorised Participant upon redemption of Collateralised Currency Securities then it will sell an appropriate proportion of the Collateral to MSIP and use the proceeds of such sale to fund the payments.

(‘Endomag’). The acquisition  which is subject to completion conditions and regulatory approval as well as working capital and other customary closing adjustments  values Endomag at approximately $310 million  which is modestly above NAV Capital Allocation Policy As reported in our announcement on 30 April  we provide an update to our capital allocation policy which outlines how the Company intends to deploy its capital resources across NAV per share accretive opportunities in order to deliver long-term value for its shareholders whilst ensuring the Company has appropriate liquidity headroom. 1. The Company will continue to focus its efforts on deploying capital into exceptional primary and secondary investments 2. The Company manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves with ongoing monitoring of forecast and actual cash flows. Capital resources are managed to ensure there is sufficient headroom for 18 months’ rolling operating expenses 3. Given the strong realisation pipeline  the Directors likewise believe that the current share price provides an opportunity to deliver accretive benefits to shareholders by purchasing its own shares at the prevailing discount levels. The Company therefore intends to allocate a minimum of 10% of realisation proceeds to buy back its own shares  utilising the existing authority granted to the Board at the AGM The Company will continue to balance the pipeline of new investment opportunities against the ability to drive returns to shareholders through share buy backs whilst maintaining sufficient reserves. Martin Davis  Chief Executive Officer  Molten Ventures  commented: “This has been a productive year for Molten. We’ve continued to enhance our innovative platform to capture the exceptional investment opportunities available in backing high growth  disruptive  UK and European technology firms. The underlying performance of our portfolio companies remain strong  with valuations continuing to stabilise as the macroeconomic environment shows signs of improvement. “Looking ahead  we expect to see a step up in realisations  in the region of £100 million of capital back to the balance sheet this financial year  the proceeds of which we expect to deploy towards NAV per share accretive opportunities as outlined in our capital allocation policy today  and in doing so  continuing to maximise value for our shareholders”. As previously announced  a live webcast presentation including Q&A will be held today at 9.00am for analysts and will be available on https://brrmedia.news/GROW_FY_24.

We inject visionary companies with energy to help them to transform and grow. This energy comes in many forms - capital  of course  but also knowledge  experience  and relationships. We believe it is our role to support the entrepreneurs who will invent the future  and that future is being built  today  in Europe. As at 31 March 2024  Molten Ventures had a diverse portfolio with shareholdings in 118 companies  20 of which represent our Core holdings and account for 62% of the Gross Portfolio Value. Our Core companies include Thought Machine  Coachhub  Aiven  Ledger and Aircall. We invest across four sectors: Enterprise Technology  Hardware and Deeptech  Consumer Technology  and Digital Health and Wellness  with highly experienced partners constantly looking for new opportunities in each. We look for high-growth companies operating in new markets  with high potential for global expansion  strong IP  powerful technology  and strong management teams to deliver success. We also look for businesses with the potential to generate strong margins to ensure rapid  sustainable growth in substantial addressable markets. A member of the London Stock Exchange’s FTSE 250  Molten Ventures provides a unique opportunity for public market investors to access these fast-growing tech businesses  without having to commit to long term investments with limited liquidity. Since our IPO in June 2016  we have deployed over £1bn capital into fast growing tech companies and have realised over £520m to 31 March 2024. For more information  go to https://www.moltenventures.com/ Chairman’s introduction In the years preceding my appointment  Molten developed and built an innovative platform  cementing itself as one of Europe’s leading venture capital firms. We support high-growth  disruptive technology companies  and through our listing on the London Stock Exchange and secondary listing on Euronext Dublin  we provide access to the returns attainable from venture capital to both institutional and retail investors. I am looking forward to helping Molten Ventures build an even more successful business in the coming years. After two years of a very challenging economic and market backdrop  we are beginning to see some signs of increased market stability  helped by improved visibility on global interest rates. Our portfolio remains in good health and the overall underlying performance of our assets has been strong. While reduced M&A activity since the end of the pandemic has resulted in fewer transactions and correspondingly fewer realisations  the coming year shows more promise  highlighted most recently by the announced sales of Perkbox in the period  and Endomag post-period end  both subject to completion conditions and regulatory approval. We anticipate further exits in the course of the current financial year. In the past year  the management team has continued to enhance the platform through the equity capital raise  the all-share acquisition of Forward Partners and the subsequent purchase of a stake in Seedcamp Fund III. These were important initiatives in ensuring that Molten is favourably positioned going forward. We have the firepower to pursue attractive opportunities in a buyer’s market for venture capital investment in our preferred areas of expertise. I was pleased to welcome some of the portfolio companies and colleagues coming across with Forward Partners at Molten’s annual Investor Day in February  which was also my first. I have also begun a programme of meeting many of our major Shareholders  as well as industry bodies and other key stakeholders for the Group. Our AGM in 2025 will be a policy approval year for executive remuneration  and we will be proactively engaging with Shareholders on this matter in the months ahead. In January  the Financial Reporting Council announced the revisions it is making to the UK Corporate Governance Code that enhance the transparency and accountability of UK public companies  as well as help support the growth and competitiveness of the UK  and preparation is well under way to ensure that Molten continues to be fully compliant. In my role as Chairman  ensuring Molten has best-practice governance is an important priority. We commenced our first externally facilitated Board evaluation in February  and more can be found on this in the Governance section of this report. We will continue to address such issues as Board diversity  mindful of the Parker Review’s recommendations. Ensuring that Molten’s culture  ethos and mission is carried across future key employees is critical  and succession planning both for the Board and executive management is underway. We refer to this in more detail in the Nomination Committee report. We appointed Lara Naqushbandi as a Non-Executive Director in September. Lara brings with her a wealth of global commercial  strategic  and investment experience. Gervaise Slowey has succeeded Richard Pelly as the designated Non-Executive Director for employee engagement. ESG issues are important to us  and as we have stated in the past  Molten’s contribution to sustainability is two-fold  both through our consideration of ESG in investment decision-making and our excitement about investment opportunities in the climate tech space in particular. We also continue to develop our reporting and remuneration structure in alignment to ESG and wider sustainability best practice. More information can be found in the ESG pages of our Annual Report  and in our inaugural stand alone Sustainability Report which has also been released today. I am conscious that Karen Slatford and Grahame Cook (who adeptly covered her role as Interim Chair) will be hard acts to follow. They have served Molten with distinction over several years – Grahame continues to do so as Senior Independent Director and Chairman of the Audit  Risk and Valuations Committee – and have helped to develop the firm into the innovative venture capital investor it is today. I would like to thank them both for their leadership of the Board  and in particular Grahame for an informed and seamless handover. I look forward to supporting management and the wider team in continuing to develop a platform that provides inspirational founders with long-term capital  access to international networks and decades of experience building businesses. Finally  I would like to thank our Shareholders for their support during the past year as well as our Executive Directors  and  importantly  each of our employees who are so vital in ensuring the continued growth of Molten Ventures plc. Laurence Hollingworth Chairman CEO’s statement Overview It has been a busy and productive year for Molten Ventures  marked with significant achievements amid an economic backdrop that has been challenging for most technology companies and those who invest in them. We continued to develop our platform  operating model  and acquisition strategy while simultaneously navigating ‘higher-for-longer’ interest rates  inflationary pressures and the ongoing geopolitical tensions which have cast a cautionary shadow over some notable signs of stabilisation in the second half of the year. Our focus within this context has been on what we can control. We have maintained discipline around our own investment process and worked closely with our portfolio companies to extend cash runways  control costs  and retain talent. Our business performance and the revenue growth of our portfolio companies has remained strong  and the disruptive entrepreneurs we have backed across UK and Europe continue to transform the industries in which they operate. Our adaptable model allowed us to act quickly to identify opportunities at attractive valuations in the year  with a focus on providing value for our Shareholders. Data from previous downturns suggests that investments made in periods of economic decline have yielded some of the greatest returns of all vintages for technology investors. We continued to support innovation through our fundraising activity  and by offering exposure to investors of privately owned technology assets in the year. Forward Partners acquisition In November 2023  we announced a share-for-share acquisition of Forward Partners  adding a portfolio of over 40 companies. The acquisition  completed in March 2024  blends the maturity of our assets with a more diverse pipeline of earlier-stage companies for follow-on investment. Forward Partners was founded in 2013 by Nic Brisbourne  a former Molten Partner. Forward Partners investment strategy has been focused on earlier-stage businesses than Molten has traditionally invested in previously. We see significant opportunity for continued growth in these portfolio companies and to accelerate value creation. The Molten platform can provide the winners with the additional support and resource to reach their potential and generate returns. We extended an official welcome to Nic Brisbourne and the rest of the Forward Partners team in March  with the history between Molten and Forward allowing for a smooth integration which can be attributed in part to a similar set of experiences  investment ethos and cultural affinity. Several of our Forward Partners colleagues have now joined our investment and finance teams  leading to cost synergies and alignment across operational functions. Alongside the Forward Partners transaction we successfully completed an oversubscribed fundraise of £55 million (net of fees) by way of issuance of new shares on the London Stock Exchange  and the Euronext Dublin  to capitalise on attractive primary and secondary investment opportunities during a period of market dislocation. Seedcamp III acquisition Our acquisition of a stake in Seedcamp III in February 2024  builds on Molten’s strategy to access exceptional Secondary investments at attractive valuations. Our Secondaries acquisition strategy acts to leverage our network in the venture capital market to provide liquidity to Limited Partners in later life funds  with a focus on acquiring portfolios of high-quality assets with nearer-term visibility on realisation opportunities. To date  the Secondaries strategy has delivered 2.5x returns (as a multiple on invested capital). The Seedcamp acquisition is an illustration of our strategy in action and comes on the back of a strong track record of Secondary investments; including Seedcamp Funds I & II  Earlybird DWES Funds IV and Earlybird Digital East Fund I. Third-party asset activity Elsewhere  we continued to make progress with our third-party assets strategy through the launch of our Irish-focused fund in July 2023  which continues our long-standing relationship with the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund as a strategic partner – as we continue to back promising Irish technology companies and founders  in a key European centre for the global tech industry. We are pleased to welcome Isabel (‘Izzy’) Fox as the Head of Third-Party Funds  a new strategic role aimed at expanding the firm’s impact through various targeted investment funds complementing its publicly listed core model  EIS and VCT investment vehicles. With Izzy’s appointment  Molten intends to make further progress in building its third-party assets under management and associated income  including via its syndicated Fund of Funds programme and other third party private funds strategies. Venture capital as an asset class has typically generated equal or better returns compared with listed equities or other alternative asset classes  and the UK Government is keen that Defined Contribution (‘DC’) pension schemes are able to invest in these types of assets. This has the full support of the British Private Equity & Venture Capital Associations (‘BVCA’)  and is something we at Molten are supporting wholeheartedly. Facilitating access to venture capital for high-growth companies remains a priority for UK and European governments  and forms part of the UK’s proposed pension system reforms. Molten Ventures is among the 20 signatories to the BVCA’s Venture Capital Compact  supporting the UK government’s Mansion House initiative to improve DC pension schemes’ access to venture capital investments. Molten Board Our most valuable asset is our people  and we continue to bolster our strength and expertise year-on-year. We appointed Lara Naqushbandi as a Non-Executive Director in September 2023  followed by the appointment of Laurence Hollingworth in January 2024 as Chair of the Board. Lara brings a wealth of experience from previously held roles in both finance and sustainability  and Laurence brings significant capital markets  investment banking and leadership experience to Molten. Integrating ESG We continue to develop our ESG agenda as part of our commitment to being a responsible investor. The integration of ESG across our portfolio is a business priority throughout the full investment cycle  and through our portfolio management we continue to fulfil our broader corporate purpose of advancing society through technological innovation. We aim to invest in businesses and entrepreneurs who recognise and embrace the need for more sustainable practices  and strive to improve their ESG performance to contribute towards a more sustainable and prosperous future for all. You can read more about these efforts in our Sustainability Report  also published today. During the year  we have made significant progress against the commitments set out in our Climate Strategy  particularly with regards to our portfolio engagement programme. We have also continued to disclose against PRI  CDP  TCFD and the Investing in Women Code. Finally  The Esprit Foundation awarded its first four grants to charities and organisations  whose objectives focus on the advancement of education for the public benefit (especially those aged under 30)  with particular emphasis on the fields of technology  business and entrepreneurship. Market environment and the Molten model The cost of capital remains a significant factor for investors  and we have adapted to an environment of higher-for-longer interest rates. More recently  we have seen forecasts for interest rates stabilising  which is set to allow greater visibility of the cost of capital over the next 12 to 24 months. We have seen early shifts towards fresh capital raising  with a much higher proportion of ‘flat rounds’  and in some cases small up-rounds  compared to last year. General Partners are typically raising less and taking longer to close funds due to a more restricted liquidity environment. We believe the visibility over the interest rates provides further confidence across the private market valuations. Although public and private markets are interconnected  any anticipated rise in confidence among public investors will take time to reflect in private market valuations. We remain confident that our unique and flexible model will lead to significant returns for our investors. Financial position and our portfolio We have retained the discipline of preserving our balance sheet  and raised funds  which has provided us with a sufficient cash position of £57 million  along with the £60 million additional headroom that our undrawn revolving credit facility provides. I am pleased to say that these measures have provided us with the ability to support our existing portfolio and to invest in high-quality opportunities where identified. Our portfolio has remained resilient and well-funded  and we have continued to realise investments which provides capital back for reinvestment in a period of muted liquidity. The Gross Portfolio Value at 31 March 2024 was £1 379 million  which is marginally up from £1 371 million at 30 September 2023  predominantly resulting from investments in Seedcamp III and Forward Partners. We have generated realisations of £39 million and a fair value uplift (excluding the impact of FX) of £6 million. We are rightly proud of our strong track record  having deployed more than £1 billion of capital and realised over £520 million since our IPO in 2016  achieving a 16% average return per year for our Shareholders. Realisations and exits During the period  realisations remained fairly low relative to previous years as a consequence of uncertain global macroeconomic conditions and the resulting downturn in corporate transactions across almost all industries and markets. While we do not anticipate the IPO market for high-growth technology companies to return to pre-downturn levels immediately  there is evidence that some high-tech companies are publicly considering an IPO. Historically  most of our exits have been through trade sales  and we have seen an uptick in M&A enquiries  alongside the exits of Perkbox and Endomag  subject to completion conditions and regulatory approvals (both due to take place above our holding NAV). Capital allocation With a number of realisation processes either underway or planned across the portfolio  we expect to be able to deliver in the region of £100 million in realisations this upcoming financial year alongside our existing meaningful cash resources. As reported in our announcement on 30 April  we provide an update to our capital allocation policy which outlines how the Company intends to deploy its capital resources across NAV per share accretive opportunities in order to deliver long-term value for its shareholders whilst ensuring the Company has appropriate liquidity headroom. 1. The Company will continue to focus its efforts on deploying capital into exceptional primary and secondary investments. 2. The Company manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves with ongoing monitoring of forecast and actual cash flows. Capital resources are managed to ensure there is sufficient headroom for 18 months’ rolling operating expenses. 3. Given the strong realisation pipeline  the Directors likewise believe that the current share price provides an opportunity to deliver accretive benefits to shareholders by purchasing its own shares at the prevailing discount levels. The Company therefore intends to allocate a minimum of 10% of realisation proceeds to buy back its own shares  utilising the existing authority granted to the Board at the AGM. The Company will continue to balance the pipeline of new investment opportunities against the ability to drive returns to shareholders through share buy backs whilst maintaining sufficient reserves. Outlook Our flexible investment model has consistently demonstrated its resilience and ability to generate significant returns. We have implemented a capital allocation policy that aligns with our current share price discount to NAV and the anticipated timeline for realisations. This policy ensures that we are well-positioned to maximise value for our Shareholders while maintaining a prudent approach to capital management. We remain cautiously optimistic on the stabilisation of interest rates  and the early signs of renewed capital raising activity indicating a potential shift towards a more favourable investment climate. The strength of our business model stands us in good stead. I extend my thanks to the Molten team and look forward to delivering on our strategy in the year to come. Martin Davis Chief Executive Officer Market overview Venture capital: an overview We believe that venture capital works best when VCs give their energy to help companies succeed. At Molten  this ‘energy’ can come in the form of capital  experience or knowledge  as well as building relationships with our portfolio companies that demonstrate our commitment for the long term. In its most basic form  venture capital (VC) is a form of financing where capital is invested into a company—a privately held start-up or small business—in exchange for equity or convertible debt in the company. While investing in early-stage technology companies comes with a degree of risk  VCs are driven by a conviction that tomorrow’s problems won’t be solved by today’s conventions  and that the process of rapid technological innovation and transformation is set to continue. As well as generating returns for investors  VC is about empowering start-up businesses with capital  mentorship  and advice to help them succeed in their endeavours  and in doing so  helping them create products and services that improve the human experience. Sometime these endeavours are connected to some of the world’s largest and most complex challenges  and at other times they could involve entirely new problem sets which are yet to be clearly defined. Starting a new business is always a daunting experience  and entrepreneurs often find themselves having to educate investors  customers  and the broader market as to why they exist at all. Companies raise money from VC investors to: 1. help build their business and products 2. recruit and retain a good pipeline of talent 3. make acquisitions and invest further into intellectual property 4. acquire access to relevant networks and relationships  and 5. gain advice and guidance from seasoned operators VC investors take the opportunity to assess companies  and invest in those they believe to have highly credible management teams  a unique product offering  and a framework to execute a business plan to become a prominent competitor in their respective market niche. There are three major VC markets globally which are the US  Europe  and Asia  and in 2023  over $300bn was invested between those regions in start-up businesses. While the US and Asia are larger than the European VC market  Europe is growing at a faster rate  and the capital sought to support that market growth is failing to keep pace. For this reason  Molten continues to see great opportunities to invest in the category-defining businesses of tomorrow  with a focus on investing in the best venture-stage opportunities throughout Europe. Who are Molten and how do they fit in the VC sphere? Molten disrupted the conventional venture capital model  recognising the limitations of traditional approaches in driving sustainable  transformative growth by pursuing an IPO in 2016. Our focus is to collaborate with entrepreneurs who share in our conviction that disruptive innovation is imperative for building enduring  category-defining businesses. Molten’s legacy traces back to 2006 when Esprit Capital Partners was established as a spin-off from a larger asset manager. Since then  we have scaled into a well-established VC platform  supported by a team of over 60 professionals dedicated to investing in promising start up and growth-stage businesses. While headquartered in London and Dublin  Molten’s investment platform has a pan-European mandate  spanning the entire lifecycle from seed stage (typically as a limited partner) to later stages (typically as a direct investor) through to IPO or acquisition. Our adaptable platform is designed to facilitate long-term investments and support companies throughout economic cycles  with a focus on businesses capable of fundamentally disrupting the status quo and becoming category leaders. As a minority equity investor  Molten fosters early relationships with portfolio companies  and adds value through active Board participation. Beyond capital  we provide entrepreneurs and management teams with strategic advice  mentorship  and access to a global network  which creates outcomes for all stakeholders  including our Shareholders. Molten operates a unified strategy across three vehicles: the plc  and the managed EIS and VCT funds. Where investments qualify  this structure enables us to combine three capital pools to invest in the UK and Europe’s most promising technology companies in a risk-adjusted and tax-efficient manner for our respective investors. Additionally  our Fund of Funds programme  established in 2017  enables us to gain exposure and invest in the most promising seed and early-stage venture capital funds across the UK and Europe. Seed and early-stage investing is a highly localised endeavour  requiring deep networks within local ecosystems of angel investors  incubators  and technology entrepreneurs. We believe that nascent businesses are best funded by investors who can engage founders locally or within specific verticals  and our Fund of Funds programme (complemented by the acquisition of Forward Partners) allows us to effectively leverage this expertise. Our decision in 2016 to IPO on the AlM growth market of the London Stock Exchange  and Euronext Dublin  thereby adapting beyond the traditional GP/LP model to become one of the largest public venture capital firms in Europe  was partly driven by our commitment to ‘democratise’ the returns available from venture capital as an asset class  and make the rewards of our investments accessible to public market investors  not just a small group of Limited Partners. Our innovative structure as a public company allows us to direct capital from institutional and retail investors towards our portfolio companies. We benefit from an evergreen balance sheet strategy that offers flexible investment terms  and allows Molten to focus on helping portfolio companies grow  while evaluating the market for optimal exit conditions  which we aim to achieve above NAV to maximise value for our Shareholders. This structure also provides us with the flexibility to raise capital from public market investors  including retail investors via the PrimaryBid platform  giving us the ‘firepower’ to pursue investment opportunities. Our direct investment strategy primarily focuses on early and growth-stage opportunities. We maintain a balanced portfolio that is diversified across four key sectors of consumer tech  enterprise tech  digital health and wellness  hardware and deeptech.

Towards the end of 2022 (and into the beginning of 2023) asset prices were volatile which seeped into the private markets. Across 2023 and early 2024  both valuations and volatility began to stabilise  with recent new heights on the S&P 500  STOXX 600  and the FTSE 100. Going forward  the consensus for global monetary policy appears to favour dovish sentiment which historically has supported upside potential for equity prices. As these market dynamics filter into the VC market there is a sense of cautious optimism for new compelling investment opportunities. In September 2023 we saw the highly anticipated Tech IPO for ARM Holdings which was widely regarded as a barometer for the IPO market. ARM successfully raised nearly $5 billion and has shown promising after-market performance. This is evidencing that ‘good deals can get done’ and that the public market is ready to support outstanding high growth technology businesses. The market is showing signs of improvement  and technology businesses are coming back into focus to drive performance through innovation. Much of the tailwind experienced in the technology market over the past 12 months has been driven by the potential productivity gains through rapid adoption of artificial intelligence. Microsoft’s most recent investment in Open AI valued the business at $80 billion  NVIDIA’s market cap had crossed $2 trillion  surpassing Google and closing in on Apple and Microsoft. At the earlier stages of the business lifecycle  Molten is seeing companies take the next step in this market and focusing more closely on real-world applications to drive productivity gains. Private markets typically lag public markets and 2023 displayed the largest contraction in European VC within the last ten years. 2023 saw $66 billion invested in European VC deals which was down 42% from the previous year. Much of that contraction was due to liquidity restrictions in a challenging fundraising environment coupled with repricing dynamics as a result of a higher interest-rate environment. Given the public sphere showed more promising returns than anticipated over the last 12 months to March 2024  we anticipate seeing improvements in the private market over the next 12 months due to that lag effect. Currently in 2024  we are witnessing more capital invested in European VC than in 2023. Since 2015 that continues to follow a growth trajectory for the market which is scaling more rapidly than the US or Asia. Looking closely at the quarterly investment data for European VC (see charts on bottom of this page)  it was the larger rounds in excess of $100 million that saw the biggest contractions throughout 2023  while investment in smaller/earlier rounds continued to persist at more modest valuations. Q1 2024 saw some larger deals (in excess of $250 million) come to market  raising over $7 billion in aggregate in the first quarter. Comparatively  the total investment in rounds at or above $250 million over all four quarters in 2023 was only $11 billion. Heading into the remainder of 2024  Molten sees value opportunities in the market. With the recent acquisition of Forward Partners  and having acquired a stake in Seedcamp III  we have an expanded portfolio of assets  combined with those in our Fund of Funds programme  which continue to present us with unique investment opportunities. With this in mind  Molten is well positioned to invest in the most interesting and competitive deals in the market throughout the next 12 months.

Execute on the Company’s FY25 ESG KPIs  which can be found in the Sustainability section of the report on page 49 of the Annual Report. Financial review The current market cycle has been characterised by higher interest rates leading to lower valuations  as a function of the cost of capital increasing  and reduced liquidity in an environment with less M&A and IPO activity. This backdrop has been in place since March 2022  and we responded quickly to reflect the reduced public market valuation multiples for technology businesses into our portfolio holding values in September 2022 (the first valuation period following the market adjustment). Alongside ensuring our portfolio holding values are consistent with the prevailing market  in line with IPEV guidelines  we focused on preserving the balance sheet capital by reducing the amount invested and ensuring there was sufficient liquidity to support our existing portfolio. The resilience of the portfolio has been demonstrated by: (1) the capital raisings that have been undertaken during this past two years  with over £1.2bn raised in FY23 and FY24  in spite of a less active fundraising environment  (2) the continued commercial traction and revenue growth of the portfolio businesses  and (3)  the limited capital support that was required from Molten. As we appear to be entering an improving environment for realisations  the robustness of our valuation processes and the quality of our underlying portfolio is being validated as demonstrated by our recent announcements  relating to portfolio companies Perkbox and Endomag  modestly above their holding values. The flexibility of our evergreen balance sheet model has been further illustrated through the equity fundraise in the year to take advantage of opportunities presented by a disconnected market  where asset prices have been depressed alongside limited liquidity. This provided an opportunity for the Group to acquire high-quality assets via a share acquisition of Forward Partners  and also through a stake in Seedcamp Fund III. The financial year 2024 reflects a continuation of this more challenged market environment  but also demonstrates stability in the portfolio values in the second half of the year. The first half of the year saw further reduction in valuation multiples across the broader technology sector before stabilising in the latter half of the year. In addition to the decline in public market technology valuations  private company fundraising has continued to stutter across the broader market  outside of specific pockets of interest. We have seen the impact of these factors in our own portfolio valuations. Despite this macroeconomic picture  it has been pleasing to see continued value creation stemming from our secondary strategy. Our acquisition of a stake in Seedcamp’s Fund III  along with an all-share acquisition of Forward Partners (both which took place in the second half of the year) contributed fair value uplifts to the portfolio. As ever  cash runway and preservation of liquidity remain key for our portfolio  and we are encouraged by the resilience demonstrated by our portfolio companies  as they continue to balance capital preservation and growth priorities. The first half of the financial year saw a reduction in portfolio value which was offset in the second half by a slight increase in the valuation of the existing portfolio  and increases in fair value following the acquisitions of Forward Partners and Seedcamp III. As at 31 March 2024  net assets stood at £1 251 million  an increase of £57 million on the prior year. We have generated fee income during the year of £20 million  which serves to offset our cost base such that our costs (net of income) remain substantially less than 1% of NAV. As we continue to build a broader platform to incorporate third-party assets alongside our own balance sheet  we have seen the benefit of fee income covering 93% of our general administrative expenses  including salaries. Minimising the cost drag on investment returns remains an area of focus for our management team. The Forward Partners acquisition is recognised at fair value through profit or loss (“FVTPL”) in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position and as a gain on bargain purchase in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. The terms of the acquisition for Forward Partners were one new Molten share for nine Forward Partners shares  resulting in a portfolio cost of £25 million (net of cash acquired). On acquisition  the Forward Partners portfolio was valued at £65 million  representing a gain on bargain purchase of £39 million. For more information of this transaction see Note 14. Statement of financial position Portfolio The Gross Portfolio Value at 31 March 2024 is £1 379 million (£1 371 million at 31 March 2023). The Gross Portfolio Value is an APM (see Note 35) and there is a reconciliation from the gross to net portfolio value (see Note 30). Molten has maintained a disciplined approach to its capital allocation through FY24  with cash investments below historical investment rates  and aligned to realisations during the period. Investments of £65 million  including £25 million representing the Forward Partners share-for-share exchange (net of cash acquired)  were made during the year; and cash proceeds from exits  escrows and sales of shares were received of £39 million. The gross fair value reduction on the portfolio was £18 million  of which £24 million results from a decline in foreign exchange and offset by an increase of £6 million from fair value movements. Further details on the Group’s valuation policy and valuations basis as at 31 March 2024 can be found in Notes 4 and 30 to the consolidated financial statements. The gross portfolio fair value has stabilised from and is broadly flat for the year at constant currency  reflecting a modest increase in the like-for-like portfolio in the second half of the year. The Gross Portfolio Value  presented on page 26 of the Annual Report  is subject to adjustments for the fair value of accrued carry liabilities and deferred tax to generate the net portfolio value of £1 292 million. Both carried interest liabilities and deferred tax arise at the level of our investment vehicles and are taken into account when arriving at the fair value of these vehicles to be recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position. The Net Portfolio Value has increased by £15 million to £1 292 million (31 March 2023: £1 277 million) with the summary of the movements in financial assets held at fair value through the profit and loss (FVTPL) which is recognised on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position  is shown on page 112 of the Annual Report. The fair value reduction of £29 million  in accordance with the relevant IFRS in Note 4  comprised of fair value movement on investments of £68 million is reflected in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income  offset by a £39 million gain on bargain on purchase. Carry balances of £87 million are accrued to previous and current employees of the Group based on the current fair value at the year-end and deducted from the Gross Portfolio Value. Carry payments totalling £2 million were made in the year following the realisation of assets in the underlying fund holdings that exceeded threshold returns. The non-investment movements to entities held at FVTPL were made of £16 million  including for settlement of priority profit share (“PPS”). The Gross Portfolio Value table below reconciles the gross to net portfolio values  and the movements between 31 March 2023 to 31 March 2024. The percentage of net portfolio value to Gross Portfolio Value is 94% (31 March 2023: 93%)  which reflects the decrease to carry balances in line with the movements of the portfolio. Total liquidity The consolidated cash balance at 31 March 2024 was £57 million (31 March 2023: £23 million). Total available cash for Molten Ventures at 31 March 2024 was £117 million  including £60 million undrawn on the Company’s revolving credit facility (31 March 2023: £83 million  including £60 million undrawn on the Company’s revolving credit facility). In November 2023  we completed an equity fund raise of £55 million (net of fees) from new and existing investors (including a PrimaryBid retail element)  to enable our position for new follow-on direct and secondary investments. Molten issued 21 261 548 shares comprising a placing  subscription  retail offer and offer for subscription. The proceeds of the placing are recognised in the cash balance at the year end and within the share capital movements (please see Note 26 for further detail). Debt facility The existing debt facility with J.P. Morgan Chase Bank N.A. London Branch (‘JPM’) and HSBC Innovation Bank Limited (‘HSBC’) (the ‘Debt Facility’) comprises a £90 million term loan and a revolving credit facility (‘RCF’) of up to £60 million on three and two-year availability periods respectively  and is secured against various assets and LP interests in the Group. The Debt Facility interest rate is SONIA plus a margin of 5.5% per annum and is underpinned by the value of the investment portfolio. The value of the portfolio companies is subject to periodic independent third-party valuation. The Debt Facility is utilised for investment and working capital purposes. We have been compliant with all relevant financial covenants throughout the duration of the debt facilities and at period-end. During the year  we amended the terms of the covenants relating to loan to value and market adjusted GAV to provide additional flexibility  see Note 24(i) for more information. As at 31 March 2024  the £90 million term loan is fully drawn and the £60 million RCF is undrawn and fully available  subject to utilisation conditions. The drawn amount is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at 31 March 2024  offset by capitalised fees from the set-up of the Debt Facility  which are being amortised over its life. Drawdowns and paydowns on the Debt Facility will be driven by portfolio investments and realisations. For further information  please see Note 24(i). Net assets Net assets in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at 31 March 2024 have increased by £57 million from 31 March 2023  to £1 251 million  an increase of 4.7%. This is mainly the result of the increase in the investments balance and cash due to the fund raise and Forward Partners’ acquisition  along with a decrease in deferred tax liability recognised in the statement of financial position. The Net Asset Value per share for the year ended 31 March 2024 was 662p (31 March 2023: 780p) after the issuance of new shares for the equity fund raise and share-for-share acquisition of Forward Partners. Statement of comprehensive income We recognised a loss after tax in the year of £41 million  compared to a £243 million loss in FY23. Income recognised during the year ending 31 March 2024 comprises investment fair value decreases of £29 million (year ending 31 March 2023: £240 million decreases)  including the gain on bargain purchase attributed to the Forward Partners portfolio of £39 million. Fee income of £20 million was generated in the year (year ended 31 March 2023: £23 million)  which is principally comprised of priority profit share (“PPS”)  management fees from the managed EIS/VCT funds  performance fees and promoter fees. PPS is generated from management fees charged on the underlying plc funds  as invested capital  net of realisations  increases so too does the PPS income. The decrease in fee income in the year is a result of a decrease in PPS percentage held in older vintages with the decreased level of investments in 2024. This has resulted in management fees decreasing by 12.7% in the period. Our operating costs (net of fee income) continue to be less than our target of 1% of NAV. It is anticipated that further income from fees generated from management of third-party funds will provide a further positive contribution to our cost base and profitability in the future. Finance expenses have increased to £11 million from £7 million in 2023 due to the debt facility being utilised for the full 12 months and an increase in the rate of SONIA. General and administration costs (“G&A”) of £21 million  compared to the £19 million recognised in the year to 31 March 2023  have increased in comparison to the prior year following the growth of the Investment Team and supporting infrastructure. Post-period end On 30 April 2024  Hologic  Inc  a NASDAQ listed entity  signed a definitive agreement to acquire Endomagnetics Ltd. (‘Endomag’). The acquisition  which is subject to regulatory approval as well as working capital and other customary closing adjustments  values Endomag at approximately $310 million  which is at a slight uplift to NAV.

Portfolio valuations The Gross Portfolio Value as at 31 March 2024 is £1 379 million  an increase of £8 million  net of investments  realisations and total fair value movement  from the 31 March 2023 value of £1 371 million. This represents a 1% increase in gross fair value  due to the increase in investments made in the year. £18 million is a net decrease  resulting from a £6 million increase in the gross fair value  offset by negative currency movements of £24 million. Valuations remain robust due to 97% of the portfolio value holding downside protection thanks to preference rights. Our portfolio valuations process continues to follow the IPEV Guidelines and aligns to the market movements in the period; we have seen movements in some of our key assets to reflect public market comparatives. We continue to see overall revenue growth in our portfolio companies with forecast weighted average revenue growth in the core of over 63% in the year  reflecting the ongoing innovation and digital transition continuing across sectors. The Core Portfolio is made up of 20 companies representing 62% of the Gross Portfolio Value. The core portfolio constituents has been updated to reflect the increase in valuation attributed to Freetrade  Perkbox  Riverlane and Smava  with PrimaryBid moving to the emerging portfolio category.

42657,EuroNext,Bing API,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/golden-goose-admitted-publicly-list-083309176.html,Golden Goose Admitted to Publicly List in Milan,MILAN – There’s now no impediment to the initial public offering of Golden Goose  as the admission to listing on Euronext Milan has been approved by Borsa Italiana and Italy’s watchdog CONSOB.,MILAN — There’s now no impediment to the initial public offering of Golden Goose  as the admission to listing on Euronext Milan has been approved by Borsa Italiana and Italy’s watchdog CONSOB.As reported  the first day of trading is expected to be June 21 and the price range of Golden Goose shares has been set between 9.50 and 10.50 euros. This implies a market capitalization of approximately 1.69 billion to 1.86 billion euros for the Italian company.More from WWDThe offer period is expected to start Thursday and end on or around Tuesday. The final offer price is expected to be published on Wednesday.The IPO is aiming at strengthening the group’s capital structure  allowing operating investments and reducing the company’s debt  which last year amounted to 480 million euros.Yanmei Tang  analyst at Third Bridge  a primary research business servicing private equity firms  credit investors  hedge funds and strategy consultants  said: “Golden Goose has built a strong reputation in luxury sneakers  and its loyal customers have helped it stay strong over the past year and a half  even as inflation and uncertainty hit other brands hard. They broke new ground in the sneaker world by offering personalized laces as an add-on  rather than just tossing them in the box. It’s a quirky yet smart move that highlights the power of personalization.”Third Bridge experts “are bullish on Golden Goose’s margins  seeing room for further sneaker price hikes. Additionally  the acquisition of their largest manufacturer in Italy gives them a strong edge in cost control ” continued Tang  referring to the company’s vertically integrated Made in Italy production. Golden Goose sneakers are all handmade by artisans in Italy and  to further tighten control over production  the company acquired two of its primary suppliers  Italian Fashion Team Srl and Calzaturificio Sirio Srl  enabling it to internalize production of approximately 50 percent of volumes sold in 2023.“Golden Goose has massive growth potential if they expand beyond sneakers into apparel and accessories. However  our experts say their brand positioning and messaging need to be clearer ” Tang contended.Navina Rajan  senior private capital analyst at Seattle-based PitchBook  said the listing of Golden Goose “is another example of recovery in the PE-backed listings market  especially within the consumer beauty segment.” Rajan pointed to Puig’s “significant” IPO  which “added to the testing points for market sentiment ” and said that  “given the good performance of other listings so far this year such as Galderma and CVC  favorable proof points continue to add precedence for most listings from a full European IPO pipeline  where Golden Goose fits the profile — a high-margin business priced within a reasonable range versus comps.”Story continuesPuig  the owner of brands such as Rabanne  Carolina Herrera and Jean Paul Gaultier  raised 2.6 billion euros for its founding family on its first day of trading in Barcelona last month  the largest float in Europe so far in 2024 and the biggest in Spain since 2015.Asked what Golden Goose’s IPO means for European public offerings and the company’s future  Virginie Blot  product experience management evangelist at Akeneo  said that  “unlike mass-market brands  niche brands like Golden Goose offer distinct products that cater to specific tastes  fostering deep connections with their customers. Historically  similar brands to this have remained private  often due to concerns about maintaining control and preserving brand heritage  but Golden Goose’s IPO can serve as an example that going public doesn’t necessarily dilute brand identity. Instead  it can provide the capital needed to provide personalized  authentic customer experiences at scale.”Golden Goose has been attracting younger shoppers with intentionally distressed  “lived-in” luxury  which responds to “a deep-seated desire for authenticity. Younger shoppers value products that are not just items  but unique pieces that tell a story and exude character  and the deliberate imperfections and crafted wear-and-tear of ‘lived-in’ luxury embody that desire.”Thirty percent of Golden Goose capital will be floated by the current sole shareholder of the company  Astrum SapA of Astrum 4 Srl & C. In 2020  the company was acquired by the private equity fund Permira from the Carlyle Europe buyout fund. The price tag was 1.28 billion euros.Funds advised by Invesco Advisers Inc. have undertaken to acquire shares at the final offer price  for an amount of 100 million euros  acting as cornerstone investors.There will be a lock-up of 180 days from the listing date for the selling shareholder and the company  and 360 days for selected members of management. Chief executive officer Silvio Campara will stay on in his role and as an investor.Golden Goose’s signature sneaker is the Superstar  introduced in 2007  and the brand has since launched more than 20 new models  but Campara is expanding its product offer with ready-to-wear and accessories. DTC accounted for 74 percent of revenues last year and comprises a network of 195 directly operated stores.In a statement issued earlier this week  Golden Goose  which was established in 2000  said the company is pursuing a growth strategy based on five pillars: continue nurturing leadership in sneakers; amplify brand awareness globally; evolve the group’s global presence; enhance the brand’s experiential journey  and selectively leverage new categories.From 2021 to 2023  Golden Goose reported a 23 percent compound annual growth rate in revenues and an earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization adjusted margin of around 34 percent last year.In 2023  the company registered sales of 587 million euros  an increase of 18 percent compared with 500.9 million euros in 2022  an adjusted EBITDA of 200 million euros  increasing 19 percent  and an adjusted operating profit 149 million euros  growing 22 percent.In the first quarter of the year  revenues amounted to 148 million euros  up 11 percent compared with the same period in 2023  and an adjusted EBITDA of 54 million euros  growing 17 percent compared to the first quarter last year.Best of WWD,neutral,0.05,0.94,0.01,mixed,0.28,0.24,0.48,True,English,"['Golden Goose', 'Milan', 'Chief executive officer Silvio Campara', 'quirky yet smart move', 'personalized, authentic customer experiences', 'Italian Fashion Team Srl', 'Carlyle Europe buyout fund', 'full European IPO pipeline', 'product experience management evangelist', 'senior private capital analyst', 'private equity fund', 'European public offerings', 'private equity firms', 'initial public offering', 'Calzaturificio Sirio Srl', 'massive growth potential', 'consumer beauty segment', 'Jean Paul Gaultier', 'Invesco Advisers Inc.', 'favorable proof points', 'current sole shareholder', 'final offer price', 'primary research business', 'sneaker price hikes', 'PE-backed listings market', 'Third Bridge experts', 'Golden Goose capital', 'Golden Goose shares', 'Golden Goose sneakers', 'product offer', 'personalized laces', 'Astrum 4 Srl', 'price range', 'price tag', 'offer period', 'capital structure', 'primary suppliers', 'testing points', 'high-margin business', 'selling shareholder', 'market capitalization', 'sneaker world', 'market sentiment', 'other listings', 'most listings', 'signature sneaker', 'Italian company', 'Borsa Italiana', 'first day', 'The IPO', 'operating investments', 'credit investors', 'strategy consultants', 'strong reputation', 'past year', 'new ground', 'largest manufacturer', 'strong edge', 'Seattle-based PitchBook', 'significant” IPO', 'good performance', 'reasonable range', 'Carolina Herrera', 'founding family', 'largest float', 'Virginie Blot', 'specific tastes', 'deep connections', 'younger shoppers', 'unique pieces', 'deliberate imperfections', 'Astrum SapA', 'cornerstone investors', '20 new models', 'other brands', 'mass-market brands', 'niche brands', 'similar brands', 'brand positioning', 'brand heritage', 'brand identity', '100 million euros', 'Euronext Milan', 'hedge funds', 'loyal customers', 'Navina Rajan', 'distinct products', 'deep-seated desire', 'Yanmei Tang', 'luxury sneakers', 'cost control', 'Thirty percent', 'listing date', '1.86 billion euros', '2.6 billion euros', 'Italy production', '10.50 euros', '1.69 billion', '1.28 billion', '50 percent', '74 percent', 'impediment', 'admission', 'watchdog', 'CONSOB', 'trading', 'June', 'WWD', 'Thursday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'group', 'debt', 'inflation', 'uncertainty', 'add', 'box', 'power', 'personalization', 'margins', 'room', 'acquisition', 'artisans', 'volumes', 'apparel', 'accessories', 'messaging', 'example', 'recovery', 'Puig', 'Galderma', 'CVC', 'precedence', 'profile', 'comps', 'Story', 'owner', 'Rabanne', 'Barcelona', 'Spain', 'future', 'Akeneo', 'concerns', 'scale', 'authenticity', 'items', 'character', 'wear', 'tear', 'Permira', 'amount', 'lock-up', '360 days', 'members', 'role', 'Superstar', 'DTC', 'revenues', '9.50', '480', '180']",2024-06-13,2024-06-13,finance.yahoo.com

These services will be powered by a specialized constellation of over 100 satellites collecting Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) messages broadcast from aircraft and transmitting the data back to Earth in real time.Spire will develop the space segment  including system design  building the satellites and payloads  ground control and data collection. Thales will provision the ground air traffic management system and the service supervision infrastructure. ESSP will manage the certification and the delivery of the service for air traffic surveillance purposes and perform H24 operation and supervision  ensuring the compliance with real-time  safety-critical requirements imposed to ATC. The partners will also rely on the Space Alliance* formed by Thales Alenia Space and Telespazio  to identify and implement possible synergies bringing further added value in terms of key-enabling technologies  secured network optimization and sustainable operations and services.The partners plan to certify  commercialize and start the operation of the service by 2027.“The birth of a satellite constellation fully dedicated to serving the demanding needs of air traffic management  air domain awareness and national security is a groundbreaking development for the aviation industry ” said Philip Plantholt  general manager of Aviation at Spire. “Through our strategic partnership with Thales and ESSP  we are poised to offer the first real alternative to the aging systems that exist today and embark on a journey towards even more advanced space-based solutions for aviation in the years to come.”“This innovative satellite-based surveillance service will accelerate the implementation of our new ‘Air Traffic Control as a service’ offering ” said Christian Rivierre  vice president  Airspace Mobility Solutions  Thales. “It will play a crucial role in shaping the future of the skies  serving as a vital facilitator for trajectory-based operations and laying the foundation for a safer  more environmentally friendly  and cost-efficient ATM system. Additionally  this new solution will also draw on the competences of Thales Alenia Space satellite-based surveillance systems.”Charlotte Neyret  chief executive officer of ESSP  said: “Taking the best of three worlds: Space Systems  ATC Systems and ATC Service Provision  is a game-changer for the aviation industry  providing the most valuable solution based on advanced new technologies. Our service is developed driven by users’ needs and expectations to face new service-levels  the challenge of ATC digitization and to support greener and more sustainable air travel. We will provide the full range of ESSP's Space-based CNS expertise to implement and to operate mission-critical services to ensure the highest quality of service to all aviation stakeholders”.The aviation industry faces critical challenges  with safety  security and achieving climate impact neutrality emerging as top priorities. These challenges have placed significant strain on ATM  particularly due to the absence of a surveillance solution that is high performing  scalable  and economically viable.The initiative will rely on Thales's global stature in ATM  built upon more than 50 years of terrestrial surveillance experience and the longstanding space technological background of Thales Alenia Space as a world space leader in telecommunications  earth observation  exploration and navigation. With over 175 satellites launched into orbit and nearly a decade of expertise in developing and operating ADS-B payloads  Spire holds a unique position within the New Space technology landscape. The approach is bolstered by ESSP's credentials as a certified space-based Navigation and Communication service provider  the consortium possesses the ideal resources to tackle these ambitious objectives.The new end-to-end system will meet the rigorous requirements  including latency  coverage and revisit standards  set by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and aviation authorities to be certified for air traffic surveillance.The constellation's satellites are designed to be replenished every five years  ensuring the system offers the latest and most advanced technology. This evolutionary roadmap approach ensures that end users' operational needs are consistently met with the latest advancements.In parallel to building the initial constellation  the companies will design and demonstrate a system that goes beyond ADS-B to geolocate the position of aircraft in real time  without relying on GNSS/GPS satellites. This novel system will provide a resilient solution for tracking aircraft that cannot be impacted by vulnerabilities with GNSS/GPS such as interference or outages.
