42671,Euroclear,Bing API,https://www.livemint.com/economy/what-do-you-do-with-191bn-frozen-euros-owned-by-russia-11718358391839.html,What do you do with 191bn frozen euros owned by Russia?,Ukraine has strong claims on Russia  but no frozen Russian assets it could use to settle them. The West has no claims but plenty of assets. Thus the challenge is to find a way to match these assets and claims.,"In economic terms  an asset has value because an owner might derive future benefits from it. Some assets  like cryptocurrencies  require a collective belief in those benefits. Others  like wine  will undeniably provide future pleasure  such as the ability to savour a 1974 Château Margaux. Still others  like American Treasuries  represent a claim on the government of the strongest economy in the world  backed by a formidable legal system.To derive such benefits  however  an owner must be able to access their assets. And that is where the Central Bank of Russia struggles. Much like every other central bank  the CBR stores reserve assets abroad. After Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022  the G7 froze these assets and prohibited financial firms from moving them. Of the $282bn of Russian assets immobilised in Japan and the West  some $207bn (€191bn) are held at Euroclear  a clearing-house in Belgium. When coupon payments on Russia’s assets come due or bonds are redeemed  Euroclear puts the cash into a bank account. This account is now home to roughly €132bn. Last year it earned a return of €4.4bn  which conveniently belongs to Euroclear  as per the clearing-house’s terms and conditions.Western policymakers are now considering whether these assets can be used to help Ukraine. Russia might one day have to compensate the country for war damages  which the World Bank already puts at more than $480bn. Ukraine needs more money and weapons to push back Russian advances  as well as to maintain its state and economy. At the same time  Western governments are increasingly struggling to find room in their budgets to support the war effort  and to get approval from legislatures for such spending. On February 26th Dmytro Kuleba  Ukraine’s foreign minister  once again argued that Russia’s assets should be confiscated. A day later Janet Yellen  America’s treasury secretary  called on her colleagues “to unlock the value"" of those funds. Ursula von der Leyen  president of the European Commission  wants to use Euroclear’s windfall to buy military equipment for Ukraine.How exactly could this be done? Taking assets from someone usually requires a court order  but in international law things are a little more complicated. The International Court of Justice would only be able to rule on the matter should Ukraine and Russia agree to let it decide upon reparations  which is unlikely at present. The UN Security Council has the ability to pass binding resolutions  over which Russia unfortunately holds a veto.Some  including Lawrence Summers  a former American treasury secretary  want to make use of states’ right to take so-called countermeasures. These are otherwise unlawful actions that are sometimes allowed in response to unlawful acts. That Ukraine is entitled to deploy countermeasures is undisputed. How broadly the same rules apply to those acting in support of Ukraine is more controversial. Sanctions and asset freezes fall under the category  and have been widely used against Russia. Asset confiscations do not  at least in most interpretations of international law. That is because they are irreversible and would seek to punish Russia  rather than to induce a change in its behaviour.As Lee Buchheit  a veteran of international law  notes  the problem reflects a geographical mismatch. Ukraine has strong claims on Russia  but no frozen Russian assets it could use to settle them. The West has no claims but plenty of assets. Thus the challenge is to find a way to match these assets and claims.In a recent paper  Mr Buchheit and co-authors suggest just such a way. They argue that the West could provide a loan to Ukraine  in return for which Ukraine could offer its claims on Russia as collateral. The West would agree to use only this collateral for redemption of the loan. When Russia inevitably refuses to pay up  the West would then be able to foreclose on the collateral.Would this work? One difficulty is that an international body would still have to determine precisely how much Ukraine is owed. Perhaps the UN General Assembly could enlist the World Bank to crunch the numbers. But this would require careful diplomacy on behalf of the West  as well as the support of France and Germany  which have so far been unimpressed by suggestions involving creative interpretations of international law. Mr Buchheit argues the shift in approach is not quite as big as it might appear at first. The West has already gone quite far by freezing assets and making clear that it will not give them back unless reparations are paid. As he notes: “Russia won’t pay reparations. War reparations are paid by the vanquished to the victor  and this situation does not end with the Ukrainian flag flying over the Kremlin."" In effect  he argues  the West has already taken the assets.A second difficulty is posed by Belgium  which has access to most frozen Russian assets and would therefore need to receive most of the claims against Russia from Ukraine. It might be reluctant to play such a pivotal role  given the potential for retribution. It would also be unfair to expect a country of its size to be the main provider of the initial loan to Ukraine. In order to overcome this difficulty  Mr Buchheit suggests that the initial loan to Ukraine is set up in a syndicated manner with a sharing clause  which would enable lending countries to group together both when providing the money and receiving collateral. Such an approach was adopted to fund emerging-market governments in the 1970 and 1980s before bond-financing markets took over. Just as is the case now  a mechanism was needed to share risk and access to collateral.Gold rushBut perhaps there is no need to seize Russian assets after all. Indeed  the EU is already planning to implement a windfall tax on any profits they accrue. If returns continue to be siphoned off indefinitely  the difference between confiscating the asset and confiscating the income becomes smaller and smaller. In economic terms  the West is already the owner of Russia’s assets. All that is left now is to fund Ukraine’s fight.© 2024  The Economist Newspaper Limited. All rights reserved.

This will be a loan syndicate. We're going to share the risk  because we have a shared commitment to get this done "" the official said on condition of anonymity.He would not say how much other G7 countries would contribute  nor did any other leaders on Thursday.'Historic step'G7 countries  which count the EU as their unofficial eighth member  have been Ukraine's key military and financial backers since Russia invaded in February 2022.The G7 and the EU have frozen around 300 billion euros ($325 billion) of Russian assets  much of it frozen by Euroclear  an international deposit organisation based in Belgium.EU countries say they could generate 2.5 to 3.0 billion euros a year for Kiev. from the profits on the interest.German Chancellor Olaf Scholz hailed the loan agreement as a ""historic step"" and a ""clear signal to the Russian president that he cannot simply sit this matter out"".""The basis has been created for Ukraine to be in a position to procure everything it needs... in the near future  in terms of weapons but also in terms of investment in reconstruction or in energy infrastructure "" he said.Zelensky has been engaged in a flurry of diplomacy aimed at shoring up international support  from a reconstruction conference in Berlin earlier this week to an upcoming peace conference in Switzerland at the weekend.In Puglia Thursday  he also signed what he called a ""historic"" 10-year security deal with Biden  and another with Japan.Political fluxThe summit comes at a time of extraordinary global turmoil.Apart from the conflict in Ukraine  the Hamas-Israel conflict in Gaza is raging and economic tensions are rising between China and Western countries.Many G7 countries are also in political flux  with summit attendees aware this could be Biden's last G7 summit if he loses to Donald Trump in November elections.Britain's Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is tipped to be ousted in July 4 elections  while France's Emmanuel Macron and Germany's Scholz are both under pressure after gains by the far right in EU Parliament elections last weekend.By contrast  Italy's Meloni is riding high after her far-right party came out on top in her country's EU Parliament vote.But she drew criticism from both France and the United States after reportedly seeking to remove a reference to safe access to abortion from the final G7 statement.The summit talks began Thursday with a short session on Africa  before turning to the Middle East  and on Friday the focus will turn to China — and a visit by Pope Francis.G7 leaders on Thursday confirmed their support for a truce and hostage

But Washington pushed to ""front load"" the revenue from the assets by using them to give Ukraine a big lump sum now.Officials say EU leaders agreed to the idea in part because it reduces the chances of Ukraine being short of funds if Donald Trump returns to the White House or the U.S. Congress holds up funding  as it did for months with its most recent aid package.The Republican former president had been critical of U.S. aid to Ukraine  but in April shifted his tone to say he viewed the survival of Ukraine as important to the United States.WHERE WILL THE $50 BILLION COME FROM?It will come from loans provided by the G7 members - the United States  Britain  Germany  France  Italy  Canada and Japan - and by the European Union. The loans are backed by future interest from frozen Russian assets.They are to be repaid using either the interest or reparations by Russia.Some 260 billion euros ($281 billion) in Russian assets such as central bank reserves have been frozen under sanctions imposed over Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.Around 190 billion euros of the assets are held in Euroclear  a Belgium-based central securities depository  making the EU a key player in any plan to make use of the assets. The United States holds about $5 billion of such assets.Officials estimate they will be able to call upon some 2.5 billion to 3.5 billion euros in interest every year from the assets to repay the loans.HOW MUCH WILL EACH G7 MEMBER LEND TO UKRAINE?The precise amounts must still be determined.A senior U.S. official said Washington had authorization from Congress to provide up to $50 billion in loans to Ukraine  but expected other countries to step up with their own loans  reducing the amount the U.S. would have to lend.EU officials told Reuters that the European Union - which includes G7 members France  Germany and Italy - could provide about half the $50 billion. Canada said on Thursday that it stood ready to provide $5 billion in funding.WHEN WILL THE MONEY ARRIVE AND WHAT IS IT FOR?Cash will arrive by the end of this year  although some could still flow beyond that  depending on Ukraine's ability to absorb and disburse the funds  two sources said.One official said there would be multiple disbursement channels for Ukraine that could be used for different purposes  military  budget  reconstruction and humanitarian support.That will allow Japan  which cannot constitutionally fund military expenditures abroad  to participate.WHAT IF THE ASSETS ARE NO LONGER FROZEN?The EU sanctions that froze the assets come up for renewal every six months  requiring the approval of all 27 EU members.That has raised the prospect that a single EU country - such as Hungary  which maintains close ties with Moscow - could block the renewal at some point and unfreeze the assets.EU officials say they are exploring options to reduce this risk  such as making renewals less frequent or having backup national legislation in Belgium to keep the assets frozen.If Ukraine and Russia reach a peace deal  Western officials anticipate the assets could form part of reparations to Ukraine so they could be used to repay the loan.""If there is a peace settlement  either the assets stay immobilized and keep generating interest to repay the loans  or Russia pays for the damage it's caused. Either way  there's a source of repayment "" a senior U.S. official said.WHAT HAS RUSSIA SAID?Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday described the West's seizure of Moscow's assets as ""theft"" and said it would not go unpunished.Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova said on Thursday that Moscow's response to the G7 scheme would be very painful for the European Union.The EU has declared that interest generated from the assets are ""windfall"" profits that do not belong to Russia.(Reporting by Andrea Shalal  Andrew Gray and John Irish; Editing by Alex Richardson)",neutral,0.06,0.8,0.14,negative,0.04,0.35,0.61,True,English,"['$50 billion loan plan', 'Explainer', 'G7', 'Ukraine', 'luxury Borgo Egnazia resort', 'Belgium-based central securities depository', 'senior U.S. official', 'Russian President Vladimir Putin', '2.5 billion to 3.5 billion euros', 'central bank reserves', 'U.S. aid', 'Seven rich democracies', 'big lump sum', 'multiple disbursement channels', 'backup national legislation', 'Foreign Ministry spokesperson', 'recent aid package', 'U.S. Congress', 'single EU country', 'The United States', 'One official', '260 billion euros', '190 billion euros', 'former president', 'other aid', 'The Group', 'Western resolve', 'European Union', 'intense negotiations', 'initial push', 'strong opposition', 'European countries', 'key questions', 'Donald Trump', 'White House', 'key player', 'precise amounts', 'other countries', 'MONEY ARRIVE', 'two sources', 'different purposes', 'humanitarian support', 'LONGER FROZEN', 'close ties', 'peace settlement', 'Maria Zakharova', 'Andrea Shalal', 'Andrew Gray', 'John Irish', 'Alex Richardson', '27 EU members', 'G7 members', 'G7 scheme', 'Russian assets', 'top officials', 'Western officials', 'military expenditures', 'peace deal', 'windfall"" profits', 'EU officials', 'six months', 'EU sanctions', 'southern Italy', 'future interest', 'EU leaders', '$50 BILLION', 'BARI', 'Reuters', 'proceeds', 'Ukraine', 'loans', 'Kyiv', 'fight', 'invasion', 'Moscow', 'Britain', 'Canada', 'France', 'Germany', 'Japan', 'plan', 'Thursday', 'result', 'war', 'Washington', 'agreement', 'principle', 'summit', 'arms', 'revenue', 'idea', 'part', 'chances', 'funds', 'funding', 'Republican', 'April', 'tone', 'survival', 'reparations', 'February', 'Euroclear', 'HOW', 'MUCH', 'authorization', 'half', 'Cash', 'year', 'ability', 'budget', 'reconstruction', 'renewal', 'approval', 'prospect', 'Hungary', 'point', 'options', 'risk', 'damage', 'repayment', 'Friday', 'seizure', 'response', 'Editing']",2024-06-14,2024-06-15,marketscreener.com

Significant cost reductions  coupled with the termination of the Company’s dependence on legacy variable pricing financing instruments  have ensured that Tonner Drones is in a stable financial condition as it enters the second half of 2024.With this financial restructuring behind it  management is now focused on generating shareholder value through the Company’s minority stakes in French drone companies  the Inhibitor military drone and associated patents  Countbot  potential acquisitions  and the legacy inventory left over from Delta Drone. Towards those ends  the Company provides the following updates:Minority Stakes in French Drone Companies. Tonner Drones holds minority stakes of between 8% to 15% in several non-listed drone companies located in France  including Donecle  Diodon  and Elistair. Tonner Drones is evaluating which of these companies it will continue to support given an alignment of strategic objectives  and which of these companies it will sell due to disparate strategic objectives. Following the implementation of this strategy  the Company aims to generate between €1 million and €2 million in cash in the next 12 months while maintaining a portfolio that could reach valuations in excess of € 5 million in the next years in those French drone companies.Tonner Drones holds minority stakes of between 8% to 15% in several non-listed drone companies located in France  including Donecle  Diodon  and Elistair.

Inhibitor . When new management arrived on June 5  2023  it brought with it the Inhibitor military drone technology that had been developed since 2018 at a cost of more than £ 8 million  1 and included the associated recoil elimination technology patent (that ensures the stability of the drone when firing a projectile) granted in Germany  and several patents pending in other countries. This company and its Inhibitor technology were valued in October of 2021 at more than £ 17 million. Companies associated with Jean-François Ott (Ott Heritage) and Bradley Taylor (Courcelette Holdings) sold Tonner Drones SAS  the company that owned the Inhibitor technology  German patent  and pending patents  to the Company for only € 2 million payable in seller financing through notes convertible into shares and associated earn outs. 2 Since then  an additional recoil elimination technology patent was granted in the United Kingdom  3 and just last week on 5 June 2024  the Company received correspondence stating that the patent had also been approved in Australia. The Company is dedicated to developing and marketing this technology and its patents with local partners and those in the regions where it has already made inroads  including Ukraine and Niger..

Countbot . Tonner Drones is working closely with engineering partners to evaluate its Countbot warehouse logistics robot with the goal of updating and enhancing its capabilities. This robot  developed by Delta Drone prior to the new management’s arrival  has solid potential and customer demand  but is not currently meeting the high product standards required by the new management team. Following the engineering audit of the Countbot technology  the Company’s aim will be to develop the new Countbot with our engineering partners..

The Company is regularly contacting and meeting with various companies  in France and internationally  operating in the drone and drone-related technology space  to discuss potential acquisitions or reverse takeovers. At present  despite numerous constructive and promising discussions  Tonner Drones has not entered into any term sheets or letters of intent with any of these potential targets but aims to close on at least one transaction before the end of 2024.The Company is regularly contacting and meeting with various companies  in France and internationally  operating in the drone and drone-related technology space  to discuss potential acquisitions or reverse takeovers. At present  despite numerous constructive and promising discussions  Tonner Drones has not entered into any term sheets or letters of intent with any of these potential targets but aims to close on at least one transaction before the end of 2024. Legacy Parts Inventory. Over the past few weeks  Tonner Drones has successfully consolidated the legacy inventory that it inherited from Delta Drone when new management arrived in June of 2023  and that was located in various places  into the Company’s central facility in Cannes. This now allows Tonner Drones  along with its engineering partners  to evaluate the inventory in a single location to determine what inventory continues to be of use and what inventory is obsolete or of no strategic use to the Company such that it can be sold. The Company’s aim is to strategically reduce the amount of stored inventory it currently holds through the sales of redundant assets  ultimately supplementing its short-term operational cash requirements.As set forth in its press release of 4 March 2024 1 Tonner Drones became the controlling shareholder of the Swiss company Aero41 via the conversion of its outstanding debt into equity. Aero41 was another company that Delta Drone had invested in prior to new management’s arrival and was encountering financial difficulties. Tonner Drones hoped there was a possibility of turning Aero41 around. Unfortunately  Tonner Drones has determined that Aero41 does not have sufficient turnaround potential. As such  Aero41 will enter into bankruptcy proceedings.Finally  Tonner Drones is pleased to confirm that after being briefly placed on the Euronext penalty bench on 7 June 2024  once it published its annual report and audited financial accounts on 12 June 2024  it exited the Euronext penalty bench on 14 June 2024.End of press-release.About Tonner Drones : Tonner Drones (formerly Delta Drone) develops UAVs and associated technologies for the defense and homeland security sectors.

This homologation judgment makes the plan binding on all deferred creditors  and the measures provided for therein will continue until June 2029  the end of the five-year period set by law.The restructuring plan can be accessed via the following link: https://biosenic.com/sites/default/files/2024-04/PRJ_BioSenic_FR.pdfThe homologation judgment closes the judicial reorganization procedure. BioSenic's board of directors will take the necessary decisions to implement the approved plan  and will convene a shareholders' meeting as soon as possible to ensure the conversion of the convertible bonds (other than those subscribed by Global Tech Opportunities 15) in accordance with the agreed terms.Prof. François Rieger  President of the Board and CEO of the BioSenic Group  said: ""The judicial reorganisation procedure initiated on 12 October 2023  with a 4-month reprieve from BioSenic's accumulated debts  the heaviest inherited from Bone Therapeutics  has led us to devise a general plan to restructure the company and its receivables in order to meet the needs of its development. This restructuring plan has received the positive opinion of the vast majority of creditors - grouped into classes of interest - and the Enterprise Court of Nivelles has taken this into account to send us its approval today. The completion of this plan puts us in a new era for BioSenic  enabling us to face the challenges typical of a biotech company in the advanced clinical trials phase. Indeed  our main challenge is now to run and successfully complete an international phase 3 clinical trial for the indication of graft versus host disease (cGvHD)  while developing our Lupus and Systemic Sclerosis projects"".About BioSenicBioSenic is a leading biotech company specializing in the development of clinical assets issued from its Medsenic's arsenic trioxide (ATO) platform. Key target indications for the autoimmune platform include graft-versus-host-disease (GvHD)  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  and now systemic sclerosis (SSc).Following the merger in October 2022  BioSenic combined the strategic positionings and strengths of Medsenic and Bone Therapeutics. The merger specifically enables Medsenic/Biosenic to develop an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/oral ATO (OATO).BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available athttp://www.biosenic.com.About the main Medsenic/BioSenic technology platformTheATO platform provides derived active products with immunomodulatory properties and fundamental effects on the activated cells of the immune system. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. cGvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT).Medsenic has been successful in a phase 2 trial with its intravenous formulation Arscimed®  which has orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA. The company is heading towards an international phase 3 confirmatory study  with its new  IP-protected  OATO formulation. Another selected target is moderate-to-severe forms of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae  and the gastrointestinal tract). Systemic sclerosis is now full part of the clinical pipeline of Medsenic/BioSenic. This serious chronic disease badly affects skin  lungs  or vascularization  and has no current effective treatment. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive  giving good grounds to launch a phase 2 clinical protocol  using new immunomodulatory formulations of APIs recognized to be active on the immune system.The company is currently focusing its present R&D and clinical activities on a selective  accelerated development of its autoimmune platform.Note: The allogeneic cell therapy platform-originating from the previous listed company Bone Therapeutics company  may be of renewed interest by using isolated and purified differentiated bone marrow Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) as a starting material for further isolation of passive or active biological subcellular elements. Indeed  these cells may provide new subcellular vesicles potentially able to deliver a unique and proprietary approach to organ repair. BioSenic is now involved in determining new patentable approaches in this complex area of cell therapy.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAFrançois Rieger  PhD  CEOTel: +33 (0)671 73 31 59investorrelations@biosenic.comCertain statements  beliefs and opinions in this press release are forward-looking  which reflect the company or  as appropriate  the company directors' current expectations and projections about future events.

Galapagos' product candidate GLPG5101 is produced using the company's innovative  decentralized T-cell manufacturing platform.The oral presentation includes updated safety and efficacy data for GLPG5101 in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)  follicular lymphoma (FL)  marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). The presentation also includes durability and cellular kinetics data. At the data cut-off date of December 20  2023  no unexpected safety findings were observed and treatment with GLPG5101 resulted in high complete response rates in all indications in this heavily pretreated patient population.GLPG5101 was administered as a fresh product in 94% of patients with a median vein-to-vein time of seven days  eliminating the need for bridging therapy. T-cell subsets were assessed in the apheresis starting material and final CAR-T product. There was a higher proportion of early phenotypes of CD4+ and CD8+ CAR T cells (naive/stem cell memory and central memory T cells) in the final product compared with starting material  indicating an increase of those populations during the manufacturing process. This demonstrates the feasibility of Galapagos' decentralized manufacturing platform to deliver a high-quality CAR T-cell product to patients.The new data will be presented by Marie José Kersten  M.D.  Professor of Hematology and Head of the Department of Hematology at the Amsterdam University Medical Center.""We are committed to accelerating breakthrough innovations to extend the reach of CAR-T therapies to patients with rapidly progressing cancers "" said Dr. Jeevan Shetty  M.D.  Head of Clinical Development Oncology at Galapagos. ""We are delighted to present promising new data for GLPG5101 at the EHA congress. The high complete response rates  combined with low-grade CRS and ICANS  demonstrates the potential of GLPG5101 in addressing the critical needs of this patient population. The data also confirm the feasibility of our innovative decentralized T-cell manufacturing platform in delivering fresh  fit cells with a median vein-to-vein time of just seven days.""Key new data from the ongoing Phase 1/2 ATALANTA-1 study include:As of the data cut-off date of December 20  2023  34 patients (17 in Phase 1 and 17 in Phase 2) received GLPG5101 with a median vein-to-vein time of seven days. Overall  safety results were available for 33 patients and efficacy results were available for 31 patients. The data are summarized below:GLPG5101 showed an encouraging safety profile with most TEAEs 1 of Grade 1 or 2; the majority of Grade ≥ 3 events were hematological. Two cases of CRS 2 Grade 3 were observed in Phase 1 and one case of ICANS 3 Grade 3 was observed in Phase 2.of Grade 1 or 2; the majority of Grade ≥ 3 events were hematological. Two cases of CRS Grade 3 were observed in Phase 1 and one case of ICANS Grade 3 was observed in Phase 2. In Phase 1  14 of 16 efficacy-evaluable patients responded to treatment (objective response rate  ORR 87.5%)  with 12 patients achieving a complete response (CR) (CR rate  CRR 75%). In Phase 2  14 of 15 efficacy-evaluable patients responded to treatment (ORR 93.3%)  and all responders achieved a complete response (CRR 93.3%).High ORR and CRR were observed in the pooled Phase 1 and Phase 2 efficacy analysis set  split by indication: In patients with DLBCL  7 of 9 efficacy-evaluable patients responded to treatment (ORR 78%)  with 5 patients achieving a complete response (CRR 56%). In patients with FL or MZL  objective and complete responses were observed in 16 of 17 efficacy-evaluable patients (ORR and CRR 94%). In patients with MCL  all 5 of 5 efficacy-evaluable patients responded to treatment (ORR and CRR 100%).Durable responses were observed in the majority of responding patients: 71% of patients in Phase 1 had an ongoing response at data cut-off with median follow-up of 13.1 months. 100% of patients in Phase 2 had an ongoing response at data cut-off with median follow-up of 4.2 months.Strong and consistent in vivo CAR-T expansion levels and products consisting of early phenotype T cells were observed in all doses tested.Presentation details :Abstract number/title Authors/ Presenter Presentation date/time Abstract #S243Seven-Day Vein-to-Vein Point-of-Care Manufactured CD19 CAR T Cells (GLPG5101) in Relapsed/Refractory Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma: Results from the Phase 1/2 Atalanta-1 Trial Marie José Kersten   Kirsten Saevels  Sophie Servais  Evelyne Willems  Marte C.

GLPG5101 is a second generation anti-CD19/4-1BB CAR-T product candidate  administered as a single fixed intravenous dose. The primary objective of the Phase 1 part of the study is to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy to determine the recommended dose for the Phase 2 part of the study. Secondary objectives include assessment of efficacy and feasibility of near the point-of-care manufacturing of GLPG5101. The dose levels that were evaluated in Phase 1 are 50×106 (DL1)  110×106 (DL2) and 250×106 (DL3) CAR+ viable T cells. The primary objective of the Phase 2 part of the study is to evaluate the objective response rate (ORR)  while the secondary objectives include complete response rate (CRR)  duration of response  progression free survival  overall survival  safety  pharmacokinetic profile  and the feasibility of decentralized manufacturing. Each enrolled patient will be followed for 24 months.About non-Hodgkin lymphomaNon-Hodgkin lymphoma is a cancer originating from lymphocytes  a type of white blood cell which is part of the body's immune system. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma can occur at any age although it is more common in adults over 50 years old. Initial symptoms usually are enlarged lymph nodes  fever  and weight loss. There are many different types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. These types can be divided into aggressive (fast-growing) and indolent (slow growing) types  and they can be formed from either B lymphocytes (B cells) or in lesser extent from T lymphocytes (T cells) or Natural Killer cells (NK cells). B-cell lymphoma makes up about 85% of non-Hodgkin lymphomas diagnosed in the US. Prognosis and treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma depend on the stage and type of disease.About Galapagos' T-cell manufacturing platformGalapagos' decentralized  innovative T-cell manufacturing platform has the potential for the administration of fresh  fit cells within a median vein-to-vein time of seven days  greater physician control and improved patient experience.

Shareholders are invited to contact their financial intermediary if they have any questions on this subject.Terms and conditions of the share capital reduction motivated by losses through a reduction in the par value of Casino sharesDuring its meeting held on 24 April 2024  Casino's Board of Directors decided to implement the share capital reduction in accordance with the terms of the authorization granted to it by the Shareholders’ Meeting  subject to the completion of the Casino reverse share split transactions.As a result  the par value of each Casino share has been reduced from one euro (€1.00) to one euro cent (€0.01)  representing a reduction of ninety-nine euro cents per share. The amount of this share capital reduction has been allocated to a special reserve account entitled “Special reserve arising from Share Capital Reduction no. 2 decided on 11 January 2024”  and may only be used to offset losses incurred by Casino.It is reminded that the reduction in par value is a purely technical operation  with no impact on the market value of Casino shares or on the number of shares outstanding.Consequently  Casino's share capital is now set at three million nine hundred and fifty-seven thousand four hundred and four euros and forty-four cents (€3 957 404.44)  divided into three hundred and ninety-five million seven hundred and forty thousand four hundred and forty-four (395 740 444) fully paid-up shares with a par value of one euro cent (€0.01) each.Technical adjustments to the exercise parity and exercise price  if any  of warrants issued by CasinoAs a result of the reverse share split  and by decision of the CEO dated 14 June 2024  the exercise parity and exercise price  if any  of the warrants issued by Casino on 27 March 2024 are adjusted in accordance with the following terms  set out in the notice of reverse share split published in the Bulletin des Annonces Légales Obligatoires on 29 April 2024:one hundred (100) Warrants #1 will entitle their holders  as from the end of the period of suspension of the right to exercise the Warrants #1  i.e. 18 June 2024  to subscribe to one (1) new ordinary share at a price per new ordinary share of 4.61 euros (i.e. 0.0461 euro per Warrant #1)  the Warrants #1 in circulation on the date hereof thus giving entitlement  in the event of exercise  to a maximum total number of 21 116 885 new ordinary shares of Casino with a par value of 0.01 euro each;one hundred (100) Warrants #2 will entitle the holder  as from the end of the period of suspension of the right to exercise the Warrants #2  i.e. 18 June 2024  to subscribe to one (1) new ordinary share at a price per new ordinary share of 0.0092 euros (i.e. 0.000092 euro per Warrant #2)  the Warrants #2 outstanding on the date hereof thus entitling the holder  in the event of exercise  to a maximum total number of 396 436 new ordinary shares of Casino with a par value of 0.01 euro each;one (1) Warrant #3 will entitle the holder  as from the end of the period of suspension of the right to exercise the Warrants #3  i.e. 18 June 2024  to subscribe for approximately 0.015 new ordinary shares at a price per new ordinary share of 16.88 euros (corresponding to an exercise parity of two hundred (200) Warrants #3 for three (3) new ordinary shares)  the Warrants #3 outstanding on the date hereof thus entitling the holder  in the event of exercise  to a maximum total number of 10 604 835 new ordinary shares of Casino with a par value of one euro cent (€0.01) each; andone hundred (100) Warrants Additional Shares will entitle their holders  as from the end of the period of suspension of the right to exercise the Warrants Additional Shares  i.e. 18 June 2024  to subscribe for one (1) new ordinary share at a price per new ordinary share equal to the par value of the ordinary share  the Warrants Additional Shares outstanding on the date hereof thus entitling their holders to a maximum total number of 5 083 947 new ordinary shares of Casino with a par value of one euro cent (€0.01) each.Technical adjustments to allocation rights under Casino free share allocation plansPursuant to a CEO decision dated 14 June 2024  the free shares allocation rights under existing Casino free shares allocation plans (the “Plans”) have been adjusted to take account of this reverse share split transaction.Consequently  the number of shares to be allocated to each beneficiary of the Plans has been adjusted to correspond to the product of (i) the number of free shares to be allocated to each beneficiary of the Plans prior to the start of the reverse share split and (ii) the ratio between the number of new shares comprising the Company's share capital after the reverse share split and the number of existing shares comprising the Company's share capital prior to the reverse share split  i.e. 1/100  it being specified that where the number of free shares calculated in this way is not a whole number  the number of free shares to be allocated to the beneficiary of the said free shares will  for each holder  be rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares (in accordance with the doctrine of the French tax authorities).***This press release has been prepared for information purposes only and should not be construed as a solicitation or offer to buy or sell any securities or related financial instruments.

Galapagos' product candidate GLPG5101 is produced using the company's innovative  decentralized T-cell manufacturing platform.The oral presentation includes updated safety and efficacy data for GLPG5101 in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL)  follicular lymphoma (FL)  marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). The presentation also includes durability and cellular kinetics data. At the data cut-off date of December 20  2023  no unexpected safety findings were observed and treatment with GLPG5101 resulted in high complete response rates in all indications in this heavily pretreated patient population.GLPG5101 was administered as a fresh product in 94% of patients with a median vein-to-vein time of seven days  eliminating the need for bridging therapy. T-cell subsets were assessed in the apheresis starting material and final CAR-T product. There was a higher proportion of early phenotypes of CD4+ and CD8+ CAR T cells (naive/stem cell memory and central memory T cells) in the final product compared with starting material  indicating an increase of those populations during the manufacturing process. This demonstrates the feasibility of Galapagos’ decentralized manufacturing platform to deliver a high-quality CAR T-cell product to patients.The new data will be presented by Marie José Kersten  M.D.  Professor of Hematology and Head of the Department of Hematology at the Amsterdam University Medical Center.“We are committed to accelerating breakthrough innovations to extend the reach of CAR-T therapies to patients with rapidly progressing cancers ” said Dr. Jeevan Shetty  M.D.  Head of Clinical Development Oncology at Galapagos. “We are delighted to present promising new data for GLPG5101 at the EHA congress. The high complete response rates  combined with low-grade CRS and ICANS  demonstrates the potential of GLPG5101 in addressing the critical needs of this patient population. The data also confirm the feasibility of our innovative decentralized T-cell manufacturing platform in delivering fresh  fit cells with a median vein-to-vein time of just seven days.”Key new data from the ongoing Phase 1/2 ATALANTA-1 study include:As of the data cut-off date of December 20  2023  34 patients (17 in Phase 1 and 17 in Phase 2) received GLPG5101 with a median vein-to-vein time of seven days. Overall  safety results were available for 33 patients and efficacy results were available for 31 patients. The data are summarized below:GLPG5101 showed an encouraging safety profile with most TEAEs 1 of Grade 1 or 2; the majority of Grade ≥ 3 events were hematological. Two cases of CRS 2 Grade 3 were observed in Phase 1 and one case of ICANS 3 Grade 3 was observed in Phase 2.of Grade 1 or 2; the majority of Grade ≥ 3 events were hematological. Two cases of CRS Grade 3 were observed in Phase 1 and one case of ICANS Grade 3 was observed in Phase 2. In Phase 1  14 of 16 efficacy-evaluable patients responded to treatment (objective response rate  ORR 87.5%)  with 12 patients achieving a complete response (CR) (CR rate  CRR 75%). In Phase 2  14 of 15 efficacy-evaluable patients responded to treatment (ORR 93.3%)  and all responders achieved a complete response (CRR 93.3%).High ORR and CRR were observed in the pooled Phase 1 and Phase 2 efficacy analysis set  split by indication: In patients with DLBCL  7 of 9 efficacy-evaluable patients responded to treatment (ORR 78%)  with 5 patients achieving a complete response (CRR 56%). In patients with FL or MZL  objective and complete responses were observed in 16 of 17 efficacy-evaluable patients (ORR and CRR 94%). In patients with MCL  all 5 of 5 efficacy-evaluable patients responded to treatment (ORR and CRR 100%).Durable responses were observed in the majority of responding patients: 71% of patients in Phase 1 had an ongoing response at data cut-off with median follow-up of 13.1 months. 100% of patients in Phase 2 had an ongoing response at data cut-off with median follow-up of 4.2 months.Strong and consistent in vivo CAR-T expansion levels and products consisting of early phenotype T cells were observed in all doses tested.Presentation details :Abstract number/title Authors/ Presenter Presentation date/time Abstract #S243Seven-Day Vein-to-Vein Point-of-Care Manufactured CD19 CAR T Cells (GLPG5101) in Relapsed/Refractory Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma: Results from the Phase 1/2 Atalanta-1 Trial Marie José Kersten   Kirsten Saevels  Sophie Servais  Evelyne Willems  Marte C.

GLPG5101 is a second generation anti-CD19/4-1BB CAR-T product candidate  administered as a single fixed intravenous dose. The primary objective of the Phase 1 part of the study is to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy to determine the recommended dose for the Phase 2 part of the study. Secondary objectives include assessment of efficacy and feasibility of near the point-of-care manufacturing of GLPG5101. The dose levels that were evaluated in Phase 1 are 50×106 (DL1)  110×106 (DL2) and 250×106 (DL3) CAR+ viable T cells. The primary objective of the Phase 2 part of the study is to evaluate the objective response rate (ORR)  while the secondary objectives include complete response rate (CRR)  duration of response  progression free survival  overall survival  safety  pharmacokinetic profile  and the feasibility of decentralized manufacturing. Each enrolled patient will be followed for 24 months.About non-Hodgkin lymphomaNon-Hodgkin lymphoma is a cancer originating from lymphocytes  a type of white blood cell which is part of the body’s immune system. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma can occur at any age although it is more common in adults over 50 years old. Initial symptoms usually are enlarged lymph nodes  fever  and weight loss. There are many different types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. These types can be divided into aggressive (fast-growing) and indolent (slow growing) types  and they can be formed from either B lymphocytes (B cells) or in lesser extent from T lymphocytes (T cells) or Natural Killer cells (NK cells). B-cell lymphoma makes up about 85% of non-Hodgkin lymphomas diagnosed in the US. Prognosis and treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma depend on the stage and type of disease.About Galapagos’ T-cell manufacturing platformGalapagos’ decentralized  innovative T-cell manufacturing platform has the potential for the administration of fresh  fit cells within a median vein-to-vein time of seven days  greater physician control and improved patient experience.

42807,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/14/clevercards-a-configurable-payments-startup-raises-8point6-million.html,This fintech configures expense cards to block misuse — and investors just backed it with millions,Irish fintech CleverCards uses a digital platform linked to configurable expense cards to give companies control over how employees use their corporate cards.,"Miragec | Moment | Getty ImagesA startup that uses technology to stop employees from abusing corporate expenses just raised 8 million euros ($8.6 million) of funding from investors  defying a slump in investment for the financial technology industry. CleverCards  a Dublin-based firm  uses a digital platform linked to configurable expense cards to give companies control over how their employees use their corporate payment cards. According to a 2016 global survey of CFOs by human resources firm Robert Half  employees have made several improper expense report requests including a doggie day spa  taxidermy services  dance classes  a side of beef and even a welder. These requests  though odd  reflect a tough reality for many companies when it comes to corporate expenses: sometimes they can't trust an employees' judgment. CleverCards CEO Kealan Lennon says his platform aims to tackle exactly that.Rather than handing employees corporate credit cards they can go out and use for purchases anywhere in the world  CleverCards allows businesses to deliver prepaid cards that can be configured to only be used by certain members of staff and block certain transactions if they're viewed as inappropriate. ""Businesses want to make sure the right employee is the one that gets the card  and that it's only used for certain purposes "" Lennon told CNBC in an interview. ""It's finance control "" he added. ""The idea of a configurable payments platform hadn't been done before. And by doing it digitally  that allowed customers come along and say  I want to be able to do this with the press of a button.""watch nowCleverCards told CNBC exclusively Friday that it raised new funds in an investment round led by strategic investor Pluxee. The fresh investment takes the total money raised by CleverCards to date to over 28 million euros. Pluxee is an employee vouchers and benefits platform that spun off from French food catering firm Sodexo earlier this year. It is listed on the Euronext stock exchange in France with a valuation of 4 billion euros.Taking business from Adyen  StripeFounded in 2019  CleverCards has signed up over 10 000 businesses as customers. It counts the likes of eBay  PaddyPower  Betfair  Accenture  Microsoft and Apple as clients. Besides these businesses  CleverCard also works with public sector organizations. In 2022  CleverCards partnered with the U.K. government to help release social welfare payments to people on smart meters who usually pay their bills through direct debit  but have been forced to seek additional financial help due to rising fuel prices. The cards could only be used to pay bills on select utility companies' websites.CleverCards deployed artificial intelligence to conduct identity verification checks on recipients  helping to avoid fraud  according to Lennon. Lennon said that CleverCards' funding round stood out in what has been a brutal market for dealmaking and fundraising in fintech. ""It is a tough environment "" he said. ""In the current market logjam  it has been pretty impressive now to raise money because nobody's raising capital."" He said CleverCards is increasingly snatching business away from the likes of payment tech giants Adyen and Stripe.watch now""It's been remarkable in that  as a smaller company  right  we were looking at the Stripes and Adyens and powering ahead "" he said  adding that  now  ""we've won business against them."" CleverCards will use the fresh funds to expand its business  scale its products and explore broader opportunities  it said. In addition to the fundraise  CleverCards appointed five new non-executive directors to its board with experience in payments technology.
