42808,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://apnews.com/article/toyota-japan-automaker-shareholders-scandal-b78e3fac2dd082a85bd525db87e24ab6,Toyota shareholders demand vote against chairman Toyoda as automaker embroiled in testing scandal,Toyota's chairman Akio Toyoda will be facing some disgruntled shareholders this week  as two major proxy groups demand a vote against keeping the grandson of the founder on its board.,TOKYO (AP) — Toyota’s chairman Akio Toyoda will be facing some disgruntled shareholders this week  as two major proxy groups demand a vote against keeping the grandson of the founder on its board.The vote expected at the June 18 annual shareholders meeting comes after Toyota apologized recently over fraudulent certification tests for vehicles  a major embarrassment for a company that prides itself on a reputation for excellent quality. The raft of problems at Japanese automakers including Toyota are said not to involve any safety problems and no recalls were announced. But Toyota suspended production of three models produced by group companies in Japan.Toyota’s stock prices had tripled over the last five years to nearly 3 800 yen ($24) before cascading downward amid its latest troubles. Its shares are now trading at above 3 000 yen ($20) — a loss of about 3 trillion Japanese yen ($18 billion) in market value.Institutional Shareholder Services  majority owned by the German capital market company Deutsche Borse Group  which advises investors  said in its proxy report that Toyoda “should be considered ultimately accountable.”It noted his promises for change did not involve reshuffling of the board. While Toyota said it plans to communicate better with workers on the ground  that likely wasn’t enough to prevent a recurrence of problems with cheating on testing  ISS said.“The company’s propensity to preserve its corporate culture is in fact suspected  and Toyoda should be held accountable for that ” it said.ISS is not opposing appointments of other board members  including Toyota Chief Executive Koji Sato  who took up his post in 2023.The past year has brought a flurry of scandals involving improper checks on vehicles  including collision tests  at group companies Daihatsu Motor Co.  which makes small models  truckmaker Hino Motors and Toyota Industries Corp.  a manufacturer of forklifts and other machinery.Japanese officials say such violations were also found at Honda Motor Co.  Mazda Motor Corp. and Suzuki Motor Corp.Another major shareholder  proxy advisory company Glass Lewis & Co. recommended voting against the reappointment of Toyoda and Shigeru Hayakawa  another top executive.“More specifically  we believe that Mr. Toyoda holds responsibility for failing to ensure that the Group maintained appropriate internal controls and for the failure to ensure appropriate governance measures were implemented at Group companies ” it said in its proxy report.“Moreover  given the widespread occurrence of issues throughout the Toyota Group  this further raises questions concerning the corporate culture which has developed under the leadership of Mr. Toyoda.”Hayakawa oversaw appointments of board members  and more independent board members should be added  according to Glass Lewis  which is based in San Francisco. It also recommended voting against a proposal on lobbying by Toyota on climate change  stressing a need for more disclosure.Under Toyoda  the automaker has pushed a “multi-pathway” approach to ecological vehicles  emphasizing hybrids  which have both a gasoline engine and electric motor  and using hydrogen for fuel instead of focusing on battery electric vehicles that some ecologists favor for cutting auto emissions.Toyoda is unlikely to be ousted at the general shareholders’ meeting  to be held at the company’s headquarters in the central Japanese city named after the maker of the Prius hybrid  Lexus luxury models and Camry sedan.The biggest of Toyota’s nearly 1 million shareholders are Japanese companies such as Japanese banks and financial institutions that are unlikely to challenge the automaker. Toyota Industries  a group company  is the No. 2 shareholder.Tightly held cross-shareholdings among affiliates  long the rule in Japan  are gradually unraveling but longstanding loyalties are likely strong enough to keep Toyoda in his post. Last year  he won re-election with nearly 85% of the vote  although that was down from 96% in 2022.In a recent report on Toyota  Kazunori Maki  an auto analyst at SMBC Nikko Securities  noted that the shipments Toyota suspended affected just 1% or 2% of its global sales.He also hinted that factory workers might have skirted rules seen as meticulous but not vital for safety.In the fiscal year ended in March  Toyota’s profits doubled from the previous year  to 4.9 trillion yen ($31.9 billion)  exceeding its own projections  as vehicle sales surged and a weak Japanese yen inflated overseas earnings.Even though Toyota has lagged in shifting to EVs  the company is the world’s leading automaker  with sales of 9.4 million vehicles in the fiscal year that ended in March.The company is doing well  said Aaron Ho  an equity analyst at CFRA Research. The recent scandal would make only “a small dent ” he said. “So there are no fundamental issues. We merely think that since production is being halted — for likely a few months  we estimate — deliveries will be affected ” he told The Associated Press.“We really do not see any deterioration in the company’s culture or how the company is being managed.”In his apology over the latest problems  Toyoda referred to how he had faced a massive recall scandal in the U.S.  shortly after becoming chief executive in 2009  over what was called “unintended acceleration.”Toyoda was questioned by Congress  and apologized. This time  he appeared to be reassuring himself as well as the public that Toyota had gone through worse  and survived.“We are not a perfect company. But if we see anything wrong  we will take a step back and keep trying to correct it ” he said.___Yuri Kageyama is on X: https://twitter.com/yurikageyama,negative,0.01,0.16,0.83,mixed,0.06,0.32,0.62,True,English,"['Toyota shareholders', 'chairman Toyoda', 'testing scandal', 'vote', 'automaker', 'Toyota Chief Executive Koji Sato', 'June 18 annual shareholders meeting', 'two major proxy groups', 'German capital market company', 'general shareholders’ meeting', 'last five years', 'appropriate internal controls', 'appropriate governance measures', 'SMBC Nikko Securities', 'The Associated Press', 'Mazda Motor Corp.', 'Suzuki Motor Corp.', 'fraudulent certification tests', 'central Japanese city', 'Institutional Shareholder Services', 'Lexus luxury models', 'Daihatsu Motor Co.', 'Honda Motor Co.', 'Deutsche Borse Group', 'independent board members', 'weak Japanese yen', 'proxy advisory company', 'battery electric vehicles', 'other board members', 'Toyota Industries Corp.', '3 trillion Japanese yen', 'top executive', 'electric motor', 'market value', 'major shareholder', 'disgruntled shareholders', 'proxy report', '1 million shareholders', 'major embarrassment', 'collision tests', 'other machinery', '4.9 trillion yen', 'Japanese automakers', 'Japanese officials', 'Japanese companies', 'Japanese banks', 'three models', 'small models', 'No. 2 shareholder', 'excellent quality', 'group companies', 'stock prices', 'latest troubles', 'past year', 'improper checks', 'Hino Motors', 'Glass Lewis', 'widespread occurrence', 'San Francisco', 'multi-pathway” approach', 'gasoline engine', 'auto emissions', 'Prius hybrid', 'Camry sedan', 'financial institutions', 'longstanding loyalties', 'recent report', 'Kazunori Maki', 'auto analyst', 'fiscal year', 'previous year', 'overseas earnings', 'Aaron Ho', 'equity analyst', 'CFRA Research', 'recent scandal', 'small dent', 'ecological vehicles', '9.4 million vehicles', 'corporate culture', 'group company', 'global sales', 'vehicle sales', 'Shigeru Hayakawa', 'Toyota Group', 'climate change', 'factory workers', 'fundamental issues', 'Akio Toyoda', 'Mr. Toyoda', 'leading automaker', 'safety problems', '3,800 yen', '3,000 yen', 'TOKYO', 'chairman', 'vote', 'grandson', 'founder', 'reputation', 'raft', 'recalls', 'production', 'shares', 'loss', 'investors', 'promises', 'reshuffling', 'ground', 'recurrence', 'testing', 'propensity', 'appointments', 'post', 'flurry', 'scandals', 'truckmaker', 'manufacturer', 'forklifts', 'violations', 'reappointment', 'responsibility', 'failure', 'questions', 'leadership', 'proposal', 'lobbying', 'need', 'disclosure', 'hybrids', 'hydrogen', 'fuel', 'ecologists', 'headquarters', 'cross-shareholdings', 'affiliates', 'rule', 'election', 'shipments', 'March', 'profits', 'projections', 'EVs', 'world', 'months', 'deliveries', 'deterioration', '96']",2024-06-16,2024-06-16,apnews.com
