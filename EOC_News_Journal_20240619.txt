The Finnish Trade Register has issued its permit for the Transfer on 20 May 2024. The Company expects that all other necessary consents and approvals for the Transfer will have been received and all conditions for the Transfer will have been fulfilled or  where relevant  waived  by the Transfer Date.The Transfer will not affect the listing of the Company on the regulated market (Prime Standard) of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. The Company shares will continue to be listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange  and trading is expected to continue without any interruptions. The ISIN of the shares will change from the current Finnish ISIN to a new Maltese ISIN (MT0002810100). The new Maltese ISIN will be applied as of 1 July 2024.In connection with the Transfer  the Company’s issuer central securities depository (“Issuer CSD”) will change from Euroclear Finland Oy (“EFi”) to the CSD operated by the Malta Stock Exchange (“MSE CSD”) and  consequently  the Company’s shares will be removed from the Finnish book-entry securities depository maintained by EFi. As a result of this change  the MSE CSD will hold the Company’s share register. No individual shareholders will be registered with the MSE CSD  however. Instead  all the Company’s shares will be held through the international central securities depository Clearstream Banking S.A.  Luxembourg (“CBL”) acting as a nominee.To facilitate the Transfer and the change of the Issuer CSD and to avoid even any temporary disruption in trading in the Company shares  the shares that are not yet held through CBL  acting  among others  for its sister company the German central securities depository Clearstream Banking AG  Frankfurt (“CBF”  together with CBL  “Clearstream”) will be transferred to CBL’s account in EFi already prior to the Transfer Date. The transfers to Clearstream are expected to take place at the latest before or during the last week of June so that all shares will be held through CBL prior to the Transfer Date.The transfers to CBL’s account in EFi will  in most cases  take place without any action required from the shareholders. However  in some cases shareholders may be contacted by their account operator or other custodian with a request for action  in which case the Company asks its shareholders to cooperate with the account operator or other custodian to ensure that the account operator or other custodian will be able to transfer the shares as described above. Failure to transfer the shares to Clearstream prior to the Transfer Date may result in the shareholder not being able to exercise their shareholder rights in the Company after the Transfer Date until they have arranged the custody of their shares with a custodian bank affiliated with CBF or CBL.Finnish book-entry accounts maintained in EFi’s book-entry system are not capable of being used for holding the Company shares after the Transfer and the change in the Issuer CSD. For shareholders currently holding their shares on Finnish book-entry accounts this means that the shares will cease to be registered on the shareholder’s book-entry account and  instead of a book-entry account  must be held in custody through Clearstream. As provided in the Board of Director’s Report dated 17 January 2024  the Transfer may have implications for the shareholders e.g. in the form of additional costs incurred as a result of the transfer of the shares and the shares being held through Clearstream.As communicated by the Company on 5 January 2024  the Transfer is the first phase in the Company’s contemplated relocation to Switzerland. After the Transfer  the Company is planning a conversion into a public limited liability company governed by the laws of Malta pursuant to Article 66 of the SE Regulation followed by a redomiciliation to Switzerland pursuant to applicable Maltese and Swiss laws.Contact:Lasse MäkeläChief Strategy and IR OfficerPhone: +41 79 371 34 17E-Mail: Lasse.makela@multitude.comAbout Multitude SE:Multitude is a listed European FinTech company  offering digital lending and online banking services to consumers  small and medium-sized businesses  and other FinTechs overlooked by traditional banks.

The Company has reshaped its portfolio  including the recently announced disposal of its UK Municipal business  delivered strong and structural increases in profitability at Coolrec and Maltha  transformed the performance in M&W with ATM outperforming plan  and delivered increasing cash generation. The Board and Executive Team fully recognise the need to deliver improved and sustained value for all shareholders. They believe they have the strategy in place to achieve this and are encouraged by the execution momentum. That said  consistent with its fiduciary duties  the Board wishes to reiterate its willingness to objectively evaluate all alternative routes to maximise value on a timely basis.The Board also remains committed to strong governance  including evolution of the Board in the ordinary course  in part to achieve the Board's ambition to meet the Board diversity targets set out in Listing Rule 9.8.6(9) by the end of 2024. The Board looks forward to the support of the Company's shareholders at the forthcoming AGM as it continues to oversee the delivery of the Company's strategic vision and creation of sustained value for all shareholders.Disapplication of pre-emption rights authorityAt the 2023 annual general meeting  in accordance with the Pre-Emption Group's Statement of Principles  the Company sought authority to issue shares for cash on a non-pre-emptive basis up to a maximum of 20% of the Company's issued share capital  spread over two resolutions (in each case  with a further authority for the purposes of making a follow-on offer). A significant minority of our shareholders voted against the increased authority requested under the second dis-application of pre-emption rights resolution  which did not pass. As a result  at the 2024 AGM  the Board is proposing a single resolution for the dis-application of pre-emption rights for up to 10% of the Company's issued share capital (plus follow-on offers)  having taken into consideration the views of our shareholders.Voting at the 2024 AGMIn order to vote by proxy you should complete a Form of Proxy and return it to our Registrar by post at the address stated on the form. In order for your Form of Proxy to be considered  the Registrar must receive it no later than 11.00 a.m. on Tuesday  9 July 2024. Alternatively  you may vote or appoint a proxy electronically at the Registrar's website  www.investorcentre.co.uk/eproxy  provided that the Registrar receives your voting or proxy instructions by 11.00 a.m. on Tuesday  9 July 2024. Whether or not you intend to attend the meeting in person  you are recommended to submit your voting instructions in advance of the AGM. This will not prevent you from attending and voting at the meeting in person should you so wish.Shareholders holding shares in CREST may appoint a proxy through the CREST system in accordance with the instructions set out under point 5 on page 8 of this circular. Shareholders holding their shares through Nederlands Centraal Instituut voor Giraal Effectenverkeer BV ('Euroclear Nederland') may vote by proxy in accordance with the instructions set out under point 6 on page 9 of this circular.RecommendationThe Board considers the resolutions to be proposed at the AGM are in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders as a whole and the Directors unanimously recommend you give them your support by voting in favour of the resolutions  as the Directors intend to do themselves in respect of their own beneficial holdings in the Company.Yours faithfullyBen VerwaayenChairmanTHIS DOCUMENT IS IMPORTANT AND REQUIRES YOUR IMMEDIATE ATTENTION.If you are in any doubt as to what action you should take  you should consult your stockbroker  bank manager  solicitor  accountant or other professional adviser authorised pursuant to the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 if you are in the UK  or from another appropriately authorised independent professional adviser if you are outside of the UK.

The Finnish Trade Register has issued its permit for the Transfer on 20 May 2024. The Company expects that all other necessary consents and approvals for the Transfer will have been received and all conditions for the Transfer will have been fulfilled or  where relevant  waived  by the Transfer Date.The Transfer will not affect the listing of the Company on the regulated market (Prime Standard) of the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. The Company shares will continue to be listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange  and trading is expected to continue without any interruptions. The ISIN of the shares will change from the current Finnish ISIN to a new Maltese ISIN (MT0002810100). The new Maltese ISIN will be applied as of 1 July 2024.In connection with the Transfer  the Company’s issuer central securities depository (“Issuer CSD”) will change from Euroclear Finland Oy (“EFi”) to the CSD operated by the Malta Stock Exchange (“MSE CSD”) and  consequently  the Company’s shares will be removed from the Finnish book-entry securities depository maintained by EFi. As a result of this change  the MSE CSD will hold the Company’s share register. No individual shareholders will be registered with the MSE CSD  however. Instead  all the Company’s shares will be held through the international central securities depository Clearstream Banking S.A.  Luxembourg (“CBL”) acting as a nominee.To facilitate the Transfer and the change of the Issuer CSD and to avoid even any temporary disruption in trading in the Company shares  the shares that are not yet held through CBL  acting  among others  for its sister company the German central securities depository Clearstream Banking AG  Frankfurt (“CBF”  together with CBL  “Clearstream”) will be transferred to CBL’s account in EFi already prior to the Transfer Date. The transfers to Clearstream are expected to take place at the latest before or during the last week of June so that all shares will be held through CBL prior to the Transfer Date.The transfers to CBL’s account in EFi will  in most cases  take place without any action required from the shareholders. However  in some cases shareholders may be contacted by their account operator or other custodian with a request for action  in which case the Company asks its shareholders to cooperate with the account operator or other custodian to ensure that the account operator or other custodian will be able to transfer the shares as described above. Failure to transfer the shares to Clearstream prior to the Transfer Date may result in the shareholder not being able to exercise their shareholder rights in the Company after the Transfer Date until they have arranged the custody of their shares with a custodian bank affiliated with CBF or CBL.Finnish book-entry accounts maintained in EFi’s book-entry system are not capable of being used for holding the Company shares after the Transfer and the change in the Issuer CSD. For shareholders currently holding their shares on Finnish book-entry accounts this means that the shares will cease to be registered on the shareholder’s book-entry account and  instead of a book-entry account  must be held in custody through Clearstream. As provided in the Board of Director’s Report dated 17 January 2024  the Transfer may have implications for the shareholders e.g. in the form of additional costs incurred as a result of the transfer of the shares and the shares being held through Clearstream.As communicated by the Company on 5 January 2024  the Transfer is the first phase in the Company’s contemplated relocation to Switzerland. After the Transfer  the Company is planning a conversion into a public limited liability company governed by the laws of Malta pursuant to Article 66 of the SE Regulation followed by a redomiciliation to Switzerland pursuant to applicable Maltese and Swiss laws.Contact:Lasse MäkeläChief Strategy and IR OfficerPhone: +41 79 371 34 17E-Mail: Lasse.makela@multitude.comAbout Multitude SE:Multitude is a listed European FinTech company  offering digital lending and online banking services to consumers  small and medium-sized businesses  and other FinTechs overlooked by traditional banks.

The EU decision to escalate their probe — which places more regulatory scrutiny on the deal — is expected to come by the current deadline of June 26.EEX has over the past few years expanded in both the US and Asia as the global electrification drive spurs interest in trading power and emissions. The firm also offers trading in agricultural commodities.In late May  EEX filed unspecified concessions to the bloc’s regulators which failed to allay the EU’s concerns  the people added.So-called phase 2 probes add about 90 working days to deal reviews. Regulators typically demand remedies to solve competition concerns but sometimes also decide to give their unconditional approval if initial concerns are shown to be unfounded.While the proposed buyout doesn’t meet standard thresholds for an EU review  several member states urged the Brussels-based commission to vet the transaction — invoking new rules that allow probes of smaller deals that could still hamper fair competition.The commission  EEX and Nasdaq all declined to comment.(Updates with EEX response in last paragraph)Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek©2024 Bloomberg L.P.,neutral,0.02,0.97,0.0,negative,0.03,0.26,0.71,True,English,"['Nasdaq Unit Takeover', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'EU Probe', 'EEX', 'Deutsche Boerse AG unit', 'European Energy Exchange AG', 'depth European Union probe', 'European power arm', 'several member states', 'biggest electricity exchange', 'The European Commission', '2024 Bloomberg L.P.', 'dominant player', 'spot market', 'regulatory scrutiny', 'current deadline', 'global electrification', 'trading power', 'agricultural commodities', 'late May', 'unspecified concessions', '90 working days', 'unconditional approval', 'standard thresholds', 'Brussels-based commission', 'new rules', 'smaller deals', 'fair competition', 'last paragraph', 'competition concerns', 'initial concerns', 'Bloomberg Businessweek', 'EU decision', 'EU review', 'Nasdaq Inc.', 'phase 2 probes', 'EEX response', 'plans', 'role', 'world', 'people', 'matter', 'anonymity', 'June', 'past', 'years', 'Asia', 'interest', 'emissions', 'firm', 'bloc', 'regulators', 'reviews', 'remedies', 'buyout', 'transaction', 'Updates']",2024-06-19,2024-06-19,finance.yahoo.com

Details on the vote tallies were not immediately available.,By YURI KAGEYAMAToyota shareholders voted Tuesday in support of all the company's proposals  including keeping Akio Toyoda  grandson of the Japanese automaker’s founder  as chairman on the board.Details on the vote tallies were not immediately available. But the company confirmed the majority voted in support of its positions. A shareholder proposal requesting that Toyota issue an annual report on its climate-related lobbying activities was rejected.The annual meeting  held at company headquarters in Toyota city  Aichi Prefecture  has drawn attention because Toyota and other major domestic makers have been embroiled in a scandal centered around fraudulent certification tests for vehicles.The cheating did not result in recalls or safety problems. A shareholder proposal requesting that Toyota issue an annual report on its climate-related lobbying activities was rejected.Still  it’s a major embarrassment for a manufacturer with a reputation for quality whose production methods are studied around the world. Some individual shareholders asked about the scandal during the meeting.Toyota  which makes the Prius hybrid  Camry sedan and Lexus luxury models  is at times seen as dragging their feet on climate change.Under Toyoda  it has pushed a “multi-pathway” approach to ecological vehicles  emphasizing hybrids  which have both a gasoline engine and electric motor  and using hydrogen for fuel instead of focusing on battery electric vehicles.“The group considers climate change measures to be one of its important management tasks and is fully concentrated on realizing carbon neutrality by 2050 ” Toyota said in explaining its recommendation on the shareholders’ vote.It stressed its multi-pathway strategy and argued it was transparent and sincere about various environmental efforts.The results were expected because Toyota’s biggest shareholders among nearly 1 million are Japanese companies such as banks  insurers and financial institutions that would be unlikely to challenge the automaker  at about 39% ownership of the total shares.Other corporate entities make up 25%  foreign corporate entities nearly 22% and individual shareholders about 14%. Toyota Industries Corp  a group company  is the No. 2 shareholder. Parts maker Denso Corp is the sixth biggest shareholder.Last year  Toyoda won re-election with nearly 85% of the vote. That was down from 96% in 2022. How much he received this year is still unclear.Toyota officials have repeatedly apologized for the fraudulent vehicle testing  and Chief Executive Koji Sato reiterated the apology at the shareholders’ meeting.Among proxy groups that wanted a vote against Toyoda was Institutional Shareholder Services  majority owned by the German capital market company Deutsche Borse Group  which advises investors.ISS said in its proxy report that Toyoda “should be considered ultimately accountable” because his promises for change did not involve reshuffling of the board  which it believed was needed to prevent a recurrence of errant tests.It did not oppose the appointments of other board members  including Sato.Another major shareholder  proxy advisory company Glass Lewis & Co  recommended voting against the reappointments of Toyoda and Shigeru Hayakawa  another top executive  citing similar reasons over the faulty tests that it said raised doubts about the company's governance and corporate culture.Hayakawa oversaw appointments of board members  and more independent board members should be added  according to Glass Lewis  based in San Francisco.In the fiscal year that ended in March  Toyota’s profits doubled from the previous year to 4.9 trillion yen ($31.9 billion)  exceeding its own projections  as vehicle sales surged and a weak Japanese yen inflated its overseas earnings.

The campaign ...,Global hospitality leader  Accor  is delighted to announce the receipt of a Silver accolade for its 100 Bites of Singapore marketing and advertising campaign at the annual The Drum Awards for Marketing held in Singapore on 30 May 2024.The campaign – crafted as part of the Singapore Tourism Board’s SingaporeReimagine Marketing Program (SMP)  which supports innovative destination marketing plans to inspire travel to Singapore – ran during the last quarter of 2023 and resulted in a 172 percent increase in room reservations across the Group’s network of hotels in Singapore.The Drum Awards is a global awards program that recognizes the best people  companies  and practices in the marketing and communications industry and focuses on outcomes rather than outputs for a measurable effect. The awards are considered a benchmark of recognition in the industry and celebrate groundbreaking creativity and strategic genius across all sectors  disciplines  and channels.Through a tech-enabled dining experience  the 100 Bites of Singapore campaign afforded diners the opportunity to learn more about Singapore’s rich  storied past and featured four restaurants  handpicked from Accor’s diverse portfolio in the Garden City. Each of the establishments offered a sustainable dining-focused cultural immersion experience  inspired by the vibrant multicultural hawker and local culinary traditions found in their respective neighbourhood. As diners journeyed through Singapore’s past  they were accompanied by a holographic virtual host  Allie  who shared the cultural significance and sustainable origins of each bite they took. Born from generative art and powered by live motion capture technology  Allie was reachable via a QR code  which directed diners to a web-based augmented reality platform. A companion video then took diners on a visual tour of each restaurant’s neighbourhood to learn more about the colourful culinary culture that inspired each menu. At ibis Singapore on Bencoolen  Allie hosted a live stream on social media to give tourists a preview of the experience  whilst an AR experience enabled foodies to take a virtual bite and see animated cultural motifs come to life.Embracing diversity while minimising waste  each of the menus that formed the 100 Bites of Singapore programme included a minimum 60 percent locally sourced or sustainably produced ingredients. Through the universal language of food  the initiative sought to engage both new and returning visitors to Singapore  inviting them to savour the rich tapestry of flavours and traditions the city has to offer.Commenting on the success of the 100 Bites of Singapore marketing and advertising campaign  Kerry Healy  Chief Commercial Officer  Middle East  Africa  Turkey & Asia Pacific  Premium  Midscale & Economy  said  With the travel and hospitality sector going through a renewed vitality post-pandemic  it was time to reignite Singapore as the go-to travel destination. Our primary objective was clear; to raise overall brand awareness for Accor post-pandemic and reinstating our market prominence while simultaneously driving visitors to Singapore through room bookings across Accor properties. Recognizing the competitive landscape  we understood that simply offering monetary incentives and adopting a one-sized fits all advertising approach would not suffice. We needed an innovative strategy focused on delivering distinctive proposition  motivating travellers  both long haul and short haul  to book with Accor.Collaborating with Dentsu Creative for the ideation process  Accor’s Brand Marketing team recognized that to amplify the true essence of Singapore and attract visitors to book was through highlighting Singapore’s multifaceted food culture  giving birth to the 100 Bites of Singapore campaign.Kerry Healy continued  “With this innovative concept in mind  we recognized that adopting a multi-phased and audience-first methodology was critical across our varying audience clusters. Moreover  we have leveraged on the burgeoning trends of metaverse  livestreaming  and augmented reality to further amplify our efforts in raising awareness.”The campaign was an overall success for Accor  beating planned impression targets and generating 172 percent higher room bookings at an improved cost per acquisition (CPA) versus the pre-pandemic era. The return on advertising spend (ROAS) was also up  reaching an unprecedented ROAS versus the pre-pandemic era and marking the highest ROAS achieved by Accor to date.100 Bites of Singapore was developed by ALL - Accor Live Limitless  Accor’s Lifestyle Loyalty programme that enhances the Accor experience during and beyond the hotel stay.

42960,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://fortune.com/2024/06/18/bic-ceo-innovation-pens-shaving-sticks-lighter-snoop-dogg/,Why Bic  the maker of pens and shaving sticks  believes it's a tech company,Bic is expanding into temporary tattoos and partnering with Snoop Dogg to market its lighters.,Many traditional companies looking to create buzz like to present themselves as tech companies. Restaurant chain Sweetgreen once said it acted more like a tech company than a purveyor of food. The New York Stock Exchange has also called itself a tech company  and even Fortune Media has been known to whisper that it’s a tech company that does journalism.It’s easy to understand why non-tech companies might want to hype their tech cred  considering the market love that actual tech companies like Microsoft and Nvidia receive in droves. But what claim can a maker of good ol’ ballpoint pens  lighters  and razors make to be a tech company?Gonzalve Bich  whose grandfather Marcel Bich founded Bic in 1945  acknowledges that while it may not fit the traditional definition of a tech company  Bic embodies the spirit of innovation that is often associated with tech giants. Bic’s approach to technology may not involve developers and programmers  but it does involve a relentless pursuit of more sustainable materials for its disposable razors and innovative ways to extend the lifespan of its lighters  he says. To be fair  Bic’s portfolio does include tech products  such as the cloud-connected  smart  and reusable notebooks made by Rocketbook  a company it acquired in 2020.“We have a very rich legacy  and we honor the past  but then we talk about reinventing the future  whether it be through technical innovation or technological innovation ” says Bich  who took the reins as CEO in 2018.Bic  which trades on the Euronext stock exchange in Paris  has looked for growth by venturing into the world of temporary tattoos. Bich describes himself as a tattoo artist on his LinkedIn page and sported tattoos on his arm depicting waves when he met with Fortune). In a perhaps more modest display of innovation  the company also plans to more than double the color options in its markers. Last year  net sales rose 9% (stripping out the impact of currency fluctuations) to hit 2.26 billion euros ($2.5 billion at current rates).“When you say ‘tech company ’ if you mean a company turned toward the future  that’s a definition I would apply ” says Bich.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.Fortune: Bic touts itself as as a tech company. What case can the maker of pens and shaving sticks make that it’s a tech company?When you say “tech company ” you mean a company turned toward the future  contemporary with its time  and maybe even a couple of degrees ahead of it. I think that definition would apply to us. We’re honoring our rich legacy and then inventing the future. So we’ve made investments  like in Rocketbook and tattoo companies  as well as technical innovations.You sell pens in an age when people communicate by text and other digital means. Why the bullishness on writing tools?The debate around the importance of handwriting was put to rest a while back. Experts around the world have all agreed that while we can’t fight technology coming into our lives  the creativity and fine motor skills you acquire when you write early in life are critical to brain development. Also  we sell in about 160 countries  and not all of them have the technology we have. When we look at the growth we’ve had  a lot of it comes from developing markets. These are countries where people are still growing their purchasing power.You call yourself a tattoo artist  and you’ve talked up Bic’s tattoo business on earnings calls. Can this ever be more than a niche market?In the last 30 years  you’ve seen the normalization of tattoos in plain sight. We are offering temporary tattoos that last a little more than two weeks. Most people walk into a tattoo store and see a wall full of options. They go on Google. They’ll think  “I haven’t found my perfect tattoo ” and that’s where temporary tattoos have come into their own. We offer a different level of permanence. This isn’t a fad.Bic mentions sustainability in its annual reports. But help me reconcile the idea of sustainability with the production and sale of disposable razors.If you look at publicly available life-cycle analyses of what you might call system shavers—those with a replaceable head—and our high-end disposable shavers  you’ll find the biggest impact is at the end of life of the product. It’s the water consumption during the shave (reduced when a razor works well since it shortens shaving time). The environmental impact of the disposal of the handle is a lot higher than our disposable one. In terms of packaging  we went from 20% of it being recycled to 80% last year. In our women’s products  40% of the handle is recycled  and you’re going to see us go higher and higher.So  where are we in the facial hair cycle? Lots of beards out there.If you look at 150 years of grooming history  it comes up and down. We’re now in a cycle of facial hair with remote work. On the other hand  body shaving has exploded over the last 20 years.So many razor brands have emerged in the last decade like Harry’s and Dollar Shave Club. What is Bic’s differentiator?We are No. 1 or No. 2 in the disposable razor segment  depending on the market. We launch exciting new products or update them. We were the first to change the handle of female razors to something ergonomic that allows ladies to shave in six different positions.Let’s talk about lighters. Cigarette use has declined sharply in the West  but is cannabis use helping you make up for that?It’s created some positive momentum  but it’s not the stratospheric growth rate that some had predicted. We run these market studies and ask people what they use a flame for. Yes  people are smoking  but they are also lighting candles. In the U.S.  the use of lighters for candles is equal to the use for smoking. In developing markets  there are other uses  such as boiling water to make it potable or for hygiene. Four years ago  as part of a strategic pivot  we rebranded this division from “lighters” to “flame for life” to reflect all the different usages. We also partnered with Snoop Dogg and Martha Stewart for marketing.,neutral,0.02,0.98,0.01,mixed,0.41,0.37,0.21,True,English,"['shaving sticks', 'tech company', 'Bic', 'maker', 'pens', 'The New York Stock Exchange', 'good ol’ ballpoint pens', 'Euronext stock exchange', 'fine motor skills', 'other digital means', 'high-end disposable shavers', 'many razor brands', 'Dollar Shave Club', 'Many traditional companies', 'actual tech companies', 'facial hair cycle', 'other hand', 'non-tech companies', 'tattoo companies', 'disposable one', 'disposable razor', 'Restaurant chain', 'tech giants', 'relentless pursuit', 'sustainable materials', 'innovative ways', 'reusable notebooks', 'rich legacy', 'tattoo artist', 'LinkedIn page', 'modest display', 'net sales', 'currency fluctuations', '2.26 billion euros', 'current rates', 'shaving sticks', 'technical innovations', 'writing tools', 'brain development', 'developing markets', 'purchasing power', 'tattoo business', 'earnings calls', 'plain sight', 'two weeks', 'tattoo store', 'perfect tattoo', 'different level', 'annual reports', 'life-cycle analyses', 'replaceable head', 'water consumption', 'grooming history', 'remote work', 'body shaving', 'last decade', 'traditional definition', 'tech company', 'last 30 years', 'biggest impact', 'environmental impact', 'last 20 years', 'temporary tattoos', 'tech products', 'technological innovation', 'color options', 'niche market', 'shaving time', 'Gonzalve Bich', 'Marcel Bich', 'Fortune Media', 'Most people', 'razors', '150 years', 'Bich.', 'buzz', 'Sweetgreen', 'purveyor', 'food', 'journalism', 'Microsoft', 'Nvidia', 'droves', 'maker', 'lighters', 'grandfather', 'spirit', 'approach', 'technology', 'developers', 'programmers', 'lifespan', 'portfolio', 'Rocketbook', 'past', 'future', 'reins', 'CEO', 'Paris', 'growth', 'world', 'arm', 'waves', 'markers', 'interview', 'clarity', 'case', 'degrees', 'investments', 'text', 'bullishness', 'debate', 'importance', 'handwriting', 'Experts', 'lives', 'creativity', '160 countries', 'lot', 'normalization', 'wall', 'Google', 'permanence', 'fad', 'sustainability', 'idea', 'production', 'disposal', 'handle', 'terms', 'packaging', 'women', 'beards', 'Harry', 'differentiator', 'No.']",2024-06-18,2024-06-19,fortune.com

The company’s oncology-focused pipeline is designed to act on the tumor microenvironment (TME) and the cancer immunity cycle by breaking tumor protection barriers against the immune system and blocking tumor repair. By neutralizing chemokines in the TME  TME Pharma’s approach works in combination with other forms of treatment to weaken tumor defenses and enable greater therapeutic impact. In the GLORIA Phase 1/2 clinical trial  TME Pharma is studying its lead drug candidate NOX-A12 in newly diagnosed brain cancer patients who will not benefit clinically from standard chemotherapy. TME Pharma has delivered top-line data from the NOX-A12 three dose-escalation cohorts combined with radiotherapy of the GLORIA clinical trial  observing consistent tumor reductions and objective tumor responses. Additionally  GLORIA expansion arms evaluate safety and efficacy of NOX-A12 in other combinations where the interim results from the triple combination of NOX-A12  radiotherapy and bevacizumab suggest even deeper and more durable responses  and improved survival. US FDA has approved the design of a randomized Phase 2 trial in glioblastoma and TME Pharma was awarded fast track designation by the FDA for NOX-A12 in combination with radiotherapy and bevacizumab for use in the treatment of the aggressive adult brain cancer  glioblastoma. NOX-A12 in combination with radiotherapy had also previously received orphan drug designation (ODD) for glioblastoma in the United States and glioma in Europe. TME Pharma has delivered final top-line data with encouraging overall survival and safety profile from its NOX-A12 combination trial with Keytruda® in metastatic colorectal and pancreatic cancer patients  which was published in the Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer in October 2021. The company has entered in its second collaboration with MSD/Merck for its Phase 2 study  OPTIMUS  to further evaluate safety and efficacy of NOX-A12 in combination with Merck’s Keytruda® and two different chemotherapy regimens as second-line therapy in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. The design of the trial has been approved in France  Spain and the United States. The company’s second clinical-stage drug candidate  NOX-E36  is designed to target the innate immune system. TME Pharma is considering several solid tumors for further clinical development.

GLORIA further evaluates safety and efficacy of NOX-A12 three additional arms combining NOX-A12 with: A. radiotherapy in patients with complete tumor resection; B. radiotherapy and bevacizumab; and C. radiotherapy and pembrolizumab.About the OPTIMUS StudyOPTIMUS (NCT04901741) is TME Pharma’s planned open-label two-arm Phase 2 study of NOX-A12 combined with pembrolizumab and nanoliposomal irinotecan/5-FU/leucovorin or gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel in microsatellite-stable metastatic pancreatic cancer patients.DisclaimerTranslations of any press release into languages other than English are intended solely as a convenience to the non-English-reading audience.

Signify will work closely with customers  partners  and public decision-makers to accelerate the sustainable energy transition.Eindhoven  NL – Signify (Euronext: LIGHT)  the world leader in lighting  has released its plan to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 90% across its entire value chain against a 2019 baseline and reach net-zero by 2040. The plan builds on Signify’s long-established leadership in transforming the lighting industry.“We fundamentally believe in the potential of light to positively impact society  and fully embrace the responsibility that comes with our leadership. As one of the first global companies to commit to verified science-based targets  we are today proud to raise our ambitions with Signify’s net-zero 2040 Climate Transition Plan.Our innovations continue to deliver leaps forward in energy efficiency and sustainable lighting technologies. We will continue to act with urgency  and use our voice to engage our customers  employees  partners  and public decision makers to accelerate climate action across our industry and beyond.”Eric Rondolat  CEO  SignifySignify’s Climate Transition Plan sets out the company’s climate strategy in line with its SBTi -validated net-zero targets:Net-zero greenhouse gas emissions across the entire value chain by 204050% reduction in absolute scope 1  2 and 3 greenhouse gas emissions by 2030  compared with 2019 base year90% reduction in absolute scope 1  2 and 3 greenhouse gas emissions by 2040  compared with 2019 base yearThe Plan includes initiatives and programs across the business and value chain  which include incentivizing suppliers to commit to renewable energy  electrification of the logistics fleet and further extending the use of energy-efficient LED lighting – the single biggest factor in reducing the lighting industry’s emissions in recent years.Since more than 90% of Signify’s value chain GHG emissions come from the use of its products throughout their lifecycle  the company’s 2040 net-zero ambitions focus on continuing to lead the industry in developing increasingly efficient lighting technologies.As a result of its actions and innovations  Signify has already achieved a 50% absolute reduction in GHG emissions across its entire value chain  including the scope 3 use phase  since 2019. Yet a sizeable proportion of the global lighting stock is still conventional  meaning there is a significant opportunity for rapid progress. A global switch to energy-efficient LED would reduce global GHG emissions by 1%  which is the equivalent of half the total emissions caused by the aviation industry.Earlier this year  Signify joined forces with Climate Group and other partners to launch Renovation Revolution with the goal of boosting renovation rates across the European Union -a crucial step if the region is to achieve its 2050 net-zero objectives. Helen Clarkson  CEO of Climate Group  said of the launch of Signify’s 2040 Climate Transition Plan:“Climate Group welcomes this Climate Transition Plan by Signify  which shows what can and must be achieved by companies if we are to decarbonize across the economy and reach net-zero. We’ve been working in partnership for over 15 years to accelerate the global rollout of LEDs and work towards a more energy efficient built environment. We look forward to many more years working together with Signify  along with other businesses and government partners  to unlock a renovation revolution and to double energy efficiency by 2030.”Paul Dickinson  co-founder of Transition Value Partners  also Founder of CDP where he is Strategic Adviser  and co-presenter of the Outrage and Optimism podcast  said:“Signify is the energy efficiency powerhouse behind Philips lighting  and the biggest manufacturer of LEDs in the world. Low energy lighting is pivotal to reducing an activity representing 2% of global emissions. As the premium global brand for responsible manufacturing and ultra-low power consumption  more and more companies committed to a just transition to net zero will specify Signify  not least to comply with their CSRD supply chain requirements. This company is a leader in global decarbonization  and its pioneering transition plan raises the bar  while showing its commitment to helping others meet their Science-Based Targets and get to net-zero.”Signify will report regularly on progress against the plan in its annual report.--- END ---For further information  please contact:CommunicationsTom LodgeTel: + 31 6 52 52 54 16E-mail: tom.lodge@signify.comFootnotes¹ According to the International Energy Agency in 2022  based on estimated IEA lighting emissions and estimated IEA global energy-related emissions.² Based on data from Signify’s proprietary calculation model.

By accelerating a circular economy for polyester  a sustainable alternative to incineration or landfill is made available.TOMRA Textiles is on a mission to close the gap in textile circularity  by contributing to designing and scaling textile sorting plants. Under this partnership agreement  TOMRA Textiles will explore specific  tangible measures to enable the preparation of post-consumer polyester waste for biorecycling according to CARBIOS’ specifications.CARBIOS' biorecycling technology involves breaking down polyester fibers into their basic components using enzymes  which are then used to produce high-quality recycled PET materials such as fibers for the textile industry. The breakthrough collaboration with TOMRA will redirect the challenging PET fraction of polyester textile waste towards biorecycling  showcasing a mutual dedication to pioneering recycling solutions for a circular economy.Emmanuel Ladent  CEO of CARBIOS: “CARBIOS is taking the lead in forming an efficient value chain for textile circularity and actively engages with global industry leaders such as TOMRA to shape the future of sustainable textiles.”Vibeke Krohn  Head of TOMRA Textiles: “The textile industry has been optimized for cost and efficiency for centuries. Closing the gap means scaling all the elements of a circular value chain – from collection to sorting to recycling technologies. Future recycling solutions depend on reliable access to feedstock. Through the collaboration with CARBIOS we hope to stimulate further investments needed to scale textile circularity.”###About CARBIOSCARBIOS is a biotech company developing and industrializing biological solutions to reinvent the life cycle of plastic and textiles.

We have succeeded in maintaining our profitable growth trajectory  thanks to all the assets that we are patiently developing and which are our strength: our logistics platform  which is expert in large parcels  and our proprietary  scalable ERP enable us to ensure maximum customer satisfaction through a high-quality direct relationship.Following the successful launch of our marketplace  which is gradually being rolled out across Europe and confirms the synergies with our historic activities  we are embarking on our new major project: the relaunch of the iconic Habitat brand.As a result  we are perfectly positioned to cover the entire European online furniture market  and we have set ourselves ambitious new medium-term targets.”Vente-unique.com outperforms its market thanks to the relevance of its business modelIn a sluggish environment for the furniture market  Vente-unique.com has once again demonstrated its ability to continue its historic double-digit growth trajectory. Gross merchandise volume rose by 18.5% to €117.3 million  while consolidated Group revenues rose by 11.4% to €90.3 million.The relevance of the model developed by Vente-unique.com has enabled it to outperform its market  drawing on both the dynamism of international sales  where the Group generated 51% of its sales for the first time in the half-year  and its marketplace  a powerful growth lever in a sluggish market. Month after month  the marketplace confirms its growing strength in all the countries where it is deployed  with it now contributing 16% of total sales in France in March 2024 (compared with 10% in March 2023)  a level that is also considered achievable in the 7 other countries covered. It is thus making a full contribution to diversifying the Group's sources of revenue  both in terms of commissions generated and fulfilment (logistics services)  which has seen remarkable growth since September 2023.Very solid half-year accountsVente-unique.com Group's gross margin has risen steadily  to 58.7% (vs. 55.0% in H1 2022-2023 and 56.2% over the full 2022-2023 financial year)  thanks to its effective pricing policy and tight control over supply costs.Thanks to the controlled rise in operating expenses in line with business growth and international expansion  the Group achieved an adjusted EBITDA margin of 12.4%  up 3.1 points on the 9.3% achieved in H1 2022-2023. The Group is thus back at its normative level on this key indicator.After depreciation  amortisation and provisions (€3.9m  including €2.3m for the application of IFRS 16)  operating profit before non-recurring items rose by 75% to €6.5m.Taking into account a financial charge of €0.1m and a tax charge of €1.6m  net profit for the first half came to €4.8m  a 2.2-fold increase on the €2.2m recorded for the first half of 2022-2023.A solid financial structure enabling a policy of regular returns to shareholdersThe solid gross operating cash flow of € 8 million generated by Vente-unique.com in the first half of the year will enable the company to calmly finance the increase in its stock levels (+ € 4.3 million) in order to support business growth and ensure product availability.After taking into account capital expenditure (€1m)  cash and cash equivalents rose by €0.7m over the half-year to €28.4m  before payment of the €0.42 dividend detached on 20 June and payable on 24 June (totalling €4.1m).

Gross merchandise volume rose by 18.5% to €117.3 million  while consolidated Group revenues rose by 11.4% to €90.3 million.The relevance of the model developed by Vente-unique.com has enabled it to outperform its market  drawing on both the dynamism of international sales  where the Group generated 51% of its sales for the first time in the half-year  and its marketplace  a powerful growth lever in a sluggish market. Month after month  the marketplace confirms its growing strength in all the countries where it is deployed  with it now contributing 16% of total sales in France in March 2024 (compared with 10% in March 2023)  a level that is also considered achievable in the 7 other countries covered. It is thus making a full contribution to diversifying the Group's sources of revenue  both in terms of commissions generated and fulfilment (logistics services)  which has seen remarkable growth since September 2023.Very solid half-year accountsVente-unique.com Group's gross margin has risen steadily  to 58.7% (vs. 55.0% in H1 2022-2023 and 56.2% over the full 2022-2023 financial year)  thanks to its effective pricing policy and tight control over supply costs.Thanks to the controlled rise in operating expenses in line with business growth and international expansion  the Group achieved an adjusted EBITDA margin of 12.4%  up 3.1 points on the 9.3% achieved in H1 2022-2023. The Group is thus back at its normative level on this key indicator.After depreciation  amortisation and provisions (€3.9m  including €2.3m for the application of IFRS 16)  operating profit before non-recurring items rose by 75% to €6.5m.Taking into account a financial charge of €0.1m and a tax charge of €1.6m  net profit for the first half came to €4.8m  a 2.2-fold increase on the €2.2m recorded for the first half of 2022-2023.A solid financial structure enabling a policy of regular returns to shareholdersThe solid gross operating cash flow of € 8 million generated by Vente-unique.com in the first half of the year will enable the company to calmly finance the increase in its stock levels (+ € 4.3 million) in order to support business growth and ensure product availability.After taking into account capital expenditure (€1m)  cash and cash equivalents rose by €0.7m over the half-year to €28.4m  before payment of the €0.42 dividend detached on 20 June and payable on 24 June (totalling €4.1m).

The company's oncology-focused pipeline is designed to act on the tumor microenvironment (™E) and the cancer immunity cycle by breaking tumor protection barriers against the immune system and blocking tumor repair. By neutralizing chemokines in the ™E  ™E Pharma's approach works in combination with other forms of treatment to weaken tumor defenses and enable greater therapeutic impact. In the GLORIA Phase 1/2 clinical trial  ™E Pharma is studying its lead drug candidate NOX-A12 in newly diagnosed brain cancer patients who will not benefit clinically from standard chemotherapy. ™E Pharma has delivered top-line data from the NOX-A12 three dose-escalation cohorts combined with radiotherapy of the GLORIA clinical trial  observing consistent tumor reductions and objective tumor responses. Additionally  GLORIA expansion arms evaluate safety and efficacy of NOX-A12 in other combinations where the interim results from the triple combination of NOX-A12  radiotherapy and bevacizumab suggest even deeper and more durable responses  and improved survival. US FDA has approved the design of a randomized Phase 2 trial in glioblastoma and ™E Pharma was awarded fast track designation by the FDA for NOX-A12 in combination with radiotherapy and bevacizumab for use in the treatment of the aggressive adult brain cancer  glioblastoma. NOX-A12 in combination with radiotherapy had also previously received orphan drug designation (ODD) for glioblastoma in the United States and glioma in Europe. ™E Pharma has delivered final top-line data with encouraging overall survival and safety profile from its NOX-A12 combination trial with Keytruda ® in metastatic colorectal and pancreatic cancer patients  which was published in the Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer in October 2021. The company has entered in its second collaboration with MSD/Merck for its Phase 2 study  OPTIMUS  to further evaluate safety and efficacy of NOX-A12 in combination with Merck's Keytruda ® and two different chemotherapy regimens as second-line therapy in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. The design of the trial has been approved in France  Spain and the United States. The company's second clinical-stage drug candidate  NOX-E36  is designed to target the innate immune system. ™E Pharma is considering several solid tumors for further clinical development.

View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240617919802/en/Air Liquide (Paris:AI) and Dunkerque LNG welcome the decision of the European Commission to support the D'Artagnan project. This CO 2 transportation and exportation infrastructure is part of the “Cap Décarbonation” initiative  which aims to reduce CO 2 emissions by 1.5 million tonnes each year in the industrial basin of Dunkirk and its surroundings. The D’Artagnan project will include an Air Liquide pipeline to transport CO 2 from the sites of capture as well as a terminal located in the port of Dunkirk to liquefy and load CO 2 on ships. The first CO 2 infrastructure project in France to receive support from the European Union  D’Artagnan would benefit from a grant of more than 160 million euros as part of the CEF-E (Connecting Europe Facility for Energy) funding program if the project is implemented.D’Artagnan is the central link of a complete value chain - the “Cap Décarbonation” initiative - which is composed of complementary projects:- CO 2 capture at Eqiom (cement plant in Lumbres1  North of France) and Lhoist (lime production in Réty2  North of France)  thanks to the implementation of Air Liquide’s CryocapTM proprietary technology  benefiting from the Innovation Fund funding program.- CO 2 transportation by pipelines and CO 2 exportation terminal - D’Artagnan project.As part of the D'Artagnan project  the CO 2 captured would be transported by pipelines built and operated by Air Liquide to a new CO 2 terminal in the West Port of Dunkirk  in the proximity of the LNG terminal.This new terminal  which would be built and operated by Air Liquide and Dunkerque LNG  would receive and liquefy CO 2   for shipment to permanent storage sites in the North Sea. As such  Air Liquide and Dunkerque LNG shareholders formed a joint venture which will benefit from Air Liquide's expertise in CO 2 management and liquefaction  combined with Dunkerque LNG’s experience in operating terminals. Designed to be open to industrial companies in the region for the transport and shipment of CO 2   this terminal would be able to receive 1.5 million tonnes per year  and  in the future  additional volumes of up to 4 million tonnes of CO 2 per year - equivalent to more than 5% of greenhouse gas emissions from industry in France. It would thus open the way to other CO 2 capture and sequestration projects in the Dunkirk basin.D’Artagnan would represent an estimated investment of more than 400 million euros3 and would benefit from a grant of more than 160 million euros as part of the CEF-E (Connecting Europe Facility for Energy) funding program. The investment decision of the project will be linked in particular to the signing of CO 2 management and capture as a service contracts.The first CO 2 infrastructure project in France to receive support from the European Union  D’Artagnan marks an essential step towards the implementation of the capture and sequestration technologies needed to reduce CO 2 emissions in France and Europe.These technologies are crucial to significantly reduce CO 2 emissions from industrial sectors producing essential materials (such as cement and lime)  whose emissions are in part difficult to reduce because they are inherent to the manufacturing process.Emilie Mouren-Renouard  member of Air Liquide’s Executive Committee and Chief Executive Officer of the Europe Industries Hub  said: “Today is the first time that a CO 2 infrastructure project in France receives support from the European Union. Together with our partner Dunkerque LNG we are delighted with this major milestone! Decarbonizing industry will be pivotal to achieving the European Union objective of reducing emissions by 55% by 2030. This is why we are involved in the D'Artagnan project  which is part of the wider “Cap Décarbonation” initiative: bringing our expertise and technologies to help industrial players in the Dunkirk industrial port basin to significantly reduce their CO 2 emissions.”Olivier Heurtin  Chairman of Dunkerque LNG  added: ""This is an exciting time for the D'Artagnan project. We are celebrating an important milestone. Europe's support is a testimony to the commitment  expertise and collaborative spirit of all the project partners. Together  we are making a positive impact. With this project  Dunkirk would have its own CO 2 export infrastructure. The first in France. This shows that this project will be a major factor in the competitiveness and attractiveness of Dunkirk and surrounding area. We are enthusiastic and proud to be an essential link in this project  which will benefit the environment  the region and its residents.”Co-funded by the European Union.

View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240617919802/en/Air Liquide (OTC: ) (Paris:AI) and Dunkerque LNG welcome the decision of the European Commission to support the D'Artagnan project. This CO2 transportation and exportation infrastructure is part of the Cap DÃ©carbonation initiative  which aims to reduce CO2 emissions by 1.5 million tonnes each year in the industrial basin of Dunkirk and its surroundings. The D'Artagnan project will include an Air Liquide pipeline to transport CO2 from the sites of capture as well as a terminal located in the port of Dunkirk to liquefy and load CO2 on ships. The first CO2 infrastructure project in France to receive support from the European Union  D'Artagnan would benefit from a grant of more than 160 million euros as part of the CEF-E (Connecting Europe Facility for Energy) funding program if the project is implemented.D'Artagnan is the central link of a complete value chain - the Cap DÃ©carbonation initiative - which is composed of complementary projects:- CO2 capture at Eqiom (cement plant in Lumbres1  North of France) and Lhoist (lime production in RÃ©ty2  North of France)  thanks to the implementation of Air Liquide's Cryocap™ proprietary technology  benefiting from the Innovation Fund funding program.- CO2 transportation by pipelines and CO2 exportation terminal - D'Artagnan project.As part of the D'Artagnan project  the CO2 captured would be transported by pipelines built and operated by Air Liquide to a new CO2 terminal in the West Port of Dunkirk  in the proximity of the LNG terminal.This new terminal  which would be built and operated by Air Liquide and Dunkerque LNG  would receive and liquefy CO2  for shipment to permanent storage sites in the North Sea. As such  Air Liquide and Dunkerque LNG shareholders formed a joint venture which will benefit from Air Liquide's expertise in CO2 management and liquefaction  combined with Dunkerque LNG's experience in operating terminals. Designed to be open to industrial companies in the region for the transport and shipment of CO2  this terminal would be able to receive 1.5 million tonnes per year  and  in the future  additional volumes of up to 4 million tonnes of CO2 per year - equivalent to more than 5% of greenhouse gas emissions from industry in France. It would thus open the way to other CO2 capture and sequestration projects in the Dunkirk basin.D'Artagnan would represent an estimated investment of more than 400 million euros3 and would benefit from a grant of more than 160 million euros as part of the CEF-E (Connecting Europe Facility for Energy) funding program. The investment decision of the project will be linked in particular to the signing of CO2 management and capture as a service contracts.The first CO2 infrastructure project in France to receive support from the European Union  D'Artagnan marks an essential step towards the implementation of the capture and sequestration technologies needed to reduce CO2 emissions in France and Europe.These technologies are crucial to significantly reduce CO2 emissions from industrial sectors producing essential materials (such as cement and lime)  whose emissions are in part difficult to reduce because they are inherent to the manufacturing process.Emilie Mouren-Renouard  member of Air Liquide's Executive Committee and Chief Executive Officer of the Europe Industries Hub  said: Today is the first time that a CO2 infrastructure project in France receives support from the European Union. Together with our partner Dunkerque LNG we are delighted with this major milestone! Decarbonizing industry will be pivotal to achieving the European Union objective of reducing emissions by 55% by 2030. This is why we are involved in the D'Artagnan project  which is part of the wider Cap DÃ©carbonation initiative: bringing our expertise and technologies to help industrial players in the Dunkirk industrial port basin to significantly reduce their CO2 emissions.Olivier Heurtin  Chairman of Dunkerque LNG  added: ""This is an exciting time for the D'Artagnan project. We are celebrating an important milestone. Europe's support is a testimony to the commitment  expertise and collaborative spirit of all the project partners. Together  we are making a positive impact. With this project  Dunkirk would have its own CO2 export infrastructure. The first in France. This shows that this project will be a major factor in the competitiveness and attractiveness of Dunkirk and surrounding area. We are enthusiastic and proud to be an essential link in this project  which will benefit the environment  the region and its residents.Co-funded by the European Union.

42999,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.finextra.com/blogposting/26334/recent-european-elections-and-their-implications-on-capital-markets,Recent European Elections And Their Implications On Capital Markets (Guy Melamed),The elections for the European Parliament  held between 6th and 9th of June  could end up signific,The elections for the European Parliament  held between 6th and 9th of June  could end up significantly impacting capital markets on the continent. This juncture could have the effect of reshaping regulatory landscapes  influencing market stability and altering cross-border economic activities.The shift to the far right in the elections saw a European sell-off  led by French markets. There have been widespread declines in stocks and increased bond yields  reflecting heightened political risk across the Eurozone following President Macron’s call for an early parliamentary election after a defeat by Marine Le Pen’s far-right party. The currency market was also impacted  with the euro falling 0.6 per cent against the dollar  according to the FT.Ultimately  the election results could lead to potential shifts in regulatory and fiscal policies  trade relations  innovation incentives and overall market stability  with an impact on investor behaviour and long-term competitiveness of European capital markets.Each of these topics is covered in turn below:Regulatory PoliciesThe EU has long been at the forefront of promoting ESG (Environmental  Social  and Governance) criteria. As Stéphane Boujnah  CEO of Euronext  has noted  we are transitioning into ESG 2.0  where the focus expands beyond mere compliance to a more integrated approach towards sustainability and energy security. The election results will heavily influence this shift. Observers will watch with interest to garner the political support for the Capital Markets Union (CMU)  which was originally created to reduce investment barriers and foster cross-border opportunities for a healthier European market.Fiscal PoliciesElection outcomes will also influence the European Central Bank (ECB) and its approach to economic stability and monetary policy. The ECB’s leadership  shaped by political appointments  will steer interest rates  liquidity provisions and inflation controls. Potential changes in fiscal policies will then have an impact on the debt market  investor confidence and economic stability.Trade RelationsBrexit continues to cast a long shadow over EU-UK financial relations. The outcome of both the EU and UK elections will play a pivotal role in determining the future of London as a financial hub and the evolving financial dynamics between the UK and the EU. Shifts in political sentiment could either ease or complicate these relations  with significant implications for market stability and investor flows. On a global scale  the EU’s trade policies with major economies like the US and China are also at stake  potentially affecting market stability and investor sentiment.Innovation IncentivesThe elections will likely influence the trajectory of fintech and digital finance in Europe. Critical areas like crypto  digital assets  digital banking and cross-border payment systems will be at the forefront of these discussions. Ensuring robust data privacy and cybersecurity measures will also be pivotal.Overall Market StabilityPolitical dynamics  including the evident rise of populism and Euroscepticism  will play a critical role in the region’s stability. A more fragmented political landscape could disrupt pro-EU integration policies  while a cohesive  pro-integration parliament could ensure continued stability and growth.Impact on financial market infrastructuresEach of the above potential shifts will in turn impact the workings of financial market infrastructures. A supportive regulatory environment  for example  will be crucial in fostering innovation within trading technologies. This includes prioritising cybersecurity  a necessity highlighted by the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA)  and encouraging modern trading technologies that enhance efficiency and reduce costs. The integration of blockchain  smart contracts and other fintech innovations into capital markets will depend on regulatory harmonisation. Standardisation across markets is essential to ensure seamless integration and functionality.Legislative priorities will also significantly impact settlement cycles and the operations of Central Securities Depositories (CSDs). A shorter  harmonised settlement cycle can reduce counterparty risk and increase market liquidity  a critical factor in maintaining a robust financial landscape. Furthermore  financial institutions  including banks and asset managers  will need to adapt their operations and strategies to comply with any new regulations  and enhance compliance and risk management practices.Achieving the strategic goals for European capital marketsThe results of the European Parliament elections will affect the realisation of the strategic goals for European capital markets  which include reducing market volatility  maintaining positive market sentiment and eliminating barriers to market entry. Improved market infrastructure and harmonised regulation will inevitably enhance liquidity and ensure smoother market operations. When combined with innovation  a more dynamic and resilient financial ecosystem can be expected.,neutral,0.02,0.97,0.01,mixed,0.2,0.28,0.53,True,English,"['Recent European Elections', 'Capital Markets', 'Guy Melamed', 'Implications', 'Digital Operational Resilience Act', 'shorter, harmonised settlement cycle', 'Marine Le Pen', 'Stéphane Boujnah', 'robust data privacy', 'Central Securities Depositories', 'European Central Bank', 'robust financial landscape', 'resilient financial ecosystem', 'cross-border payment systems', 'cohesive, pro-integration parliament', 'risk management practices', 'early parliamentary election', 'evolving financial dynamics', 'healthier European market', 'financial market infrastructures', 'fragmented political landscape', 'Capital Markets Union', 'cross-border economic activities', 'supportive regulatory environment', 'modern trading technologies', 'other fintech innovations', 'European capital markets', 'positive market sentiment', 'EU-UK financial relations', 'overall market stability', 'smoother market operations', 'European Parliament elections', 'EU integration policies', 'settlement cycles', 'harmonised regulation', 'European sell-off', 'financial hub', 'financial institutions', 'cross-border opportunities', 'Political dynamics', 'political risk', 'political sentiment', 'digital finance', 'digital assets', 'digital banking', 'economic stability', 'currency market', 'debt market', 'market volatility', 'market entry', 'French markets', 'investor sentiment', 'counterparty risk', 'Election outcomes', 'fiscal policies', 'Regulatory Policies', 'political support', 'political appointments', 'trade policies', 'continued stability', 'market liquidity', 'regulatory landscapes', 'far right', 'widespread declines', 'bond yields', 'President Macron', 'right party', 'trade relations', 'investor behaviour', 'long-term competitiveness', 'energy security', 'monetary policy', 'inflation controls', 'Potential changes', 'investor confidence', 'long shadow', 'pivotal role', 'significant implications', 'investor flows', 'global scale', 'major economies', 'Critical areas', 'evident rise', 'critical role', 'smart contracts', 'regulatory harmonisation', 'seamless integration', 'Legislative priorities', 'critical factor', 'asset managers', 'new regulations', 'strategic goals', 'election results', 'potential shifts', 'liquidity provisions', 'The EU', 'innovation incentives', 'mere compliance', 'integrated approach', 'investment barriers', 'The ECB', 'interest rates', 'cybersecurity measures', 'UK elections', '6th', '9th', 'June', 'continent', 'juncture', 'effect', 'stocks', 'heightened', 'Eurozone', 'call', 'defeat', 'dollar', 'impact', 'topics', 'turn', 'forefront', 'ESG', 'Social', 'Governance', 'criteria', 'CEO', 'Euronext', 'focus', 'sustainability', 'Observers', 'CMU', 'leadership', 'Brexit', 'future', 'London', 'China', 'stake', 'trajectory', 'crypto', 'discussions', 'populism', 'Euroscepticism', 'region', 'growth', 'workings', 'example', 'necessity', 'DORA', 'efficiency', 'costs', 'blockchain', 'Standardisation', 'functionality', 'CSDs', 'banks', 'strategies', 'realisation', 'Improved']",2024-06-18,2024-06-19,finextra.com

The reception of the story has been very positive  with strong support across the investment community.”However  “the significant deterioration in market conditions following European Parliament elections this month and the calling of a general election in France have impacted European markets performance and  in particular  the luxury sector.”Watch on FNGiven that Golden Goose  despite this context  continues to perform well  the management and shareholders “believe the current market backdrop is not the right environment to take the company public” as they have “always been determined to ensure a successful IPO for all stakeholders  with strong and sustainable aftermarket performance.”Earlier in the day  Bain & Company’s Luxury Goods Worldwide Market Study — Spring 2024  presented with Altagamma in Milan  stated that luxury revenues are expected to slow down this year  seen flat or rising up to 4 percent  dragged down by dampened consumer confidence in key markets like China and the U.S. In the first quarter of 2024  the personal luxury goods market reported a negative performance down 3 to 1 percent in terms of market value  as China suffered from diverted spending as outbound tourism favored destination cities in Japan and Europe.The admission to list on Euronext Milan was approved by Borsa Italiana and Italy’s watchdog CONSOB last week.As reported  the price range of Golden Goose shares was set between 9.50 and 10.50 euros  implying a market capitalization of approximately 1.69 billion to 1.86 billion euros.Thirty percent of Golden Goose capital was to be floated by the current sole shareholder of the company  Astrum SapA of Astrum 4 Srl & C. In 2020  the company was acquired by the private equity fund Permira from the Carlyle Europe buyout fund. The price tag was 1.28 billion euros.Funds advised by Invesco Advisers Inc. undertook the acquisition of shares at the final offer price  for an amount of 100 million euros  acting as cornerstone investors.Last week  Golden Goose  which was established in 2000  said the company is pursuing a growth strategy based on five pillars: continue nurturing leadership in sneakers; amplify brand awareness globally; evolve the group’s global presence; enhance the brand’s experiential journey  and selectively leverage new categories.From 2021 to 2023  Golden Goose reported a 23 percent compound annual growth rate in revenues and an earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization adjusted margin of around 34 percent last year.In 2023  the company registered sales of 587 million euros  an increase of 18 percent compared with 500.9 million euros in 2022  an adjusted EBITDA of 200 million euros  increasing 19 percent  and an adjusted operating profit 149 million euros  growing 22 percent.,neutral,0.06,0.9,0.04,mixed,0.2,0.27,0.53,True,English,"['Golden Goose Postpones', 'IPO', 'Luxury Goods Worldwide Market Study', '23 percent compound annual growth rate', 'personal luxury goods market', 'Carlyle Europe buyout fund', 'private equity fund', 'initial public offering', 'European Parliament elections', 'current sole shareholder', 'Invesco Advisers Inc.', 'European market volatility', 'current market backdrop', 'sustainable aftermarket performance', 'final offer price', 'European markets performance', 'Golden Goose capital', 'Golden Goose shares', 'growth strategy', 'luxury sector', 'luxury revenues', 'market source', 'market conditions', 'negative performance', 'market value', 'market capitalization', 'key markets', 'price tag', 'due course', 'first hour', 'investment community', 'significant deterioration', 'general election', 'right environment', 'consumer confidence', 'U.S.', 'first quarter', 'diverted spending', 'destination cities', 'Borsa Italiana', 'Astrum SapA', 'Astrum 4 Srl', 'five pillars', 'global presence', 'experiential journey', 'new categories', 'operating profit', 'price range', '1.86 billion euros', '1.28 billion euros', '100 million euros', '587 million euros', '500.9 million euros', '200 million euros', 'Thirty percent', 'IPO process', 'successful IPO', 'strong support', 'Euronext Milan', 'cornerstone investors', 'brand awareness', '10.50 euros', '4 percent', '1 percent', '18 percent', '19 percent', 'place', 'Friday', 'company', 'statement', 'decision', 'result', 'timing', 'suspension', 'response', 'book', 'demand', 'part', 'reception', 'story', 'calling', 'France', 'Watch', 'FN', 'context', 'management', 'shareholders', 'stakeholders', 'Bain', 'Spring', 'Altagamma', 'China', 'terms', 'tourism', 'Japan', 'admission', 'Italy', 'CONSOB', 'Permira', 'Funds', 'acquisition', 'amount', 'leadership', 'sneakers', 'group', 'earnings', 'interest', 'taxes', 'depreciation', 'amortization', 'margin', 'sales', 'increase', 'EBITDA', '9.50', '1.69']",2024-06-18,2024-06-19,footwearnews.com

The price tag was 1.28 billion euros.Funds advised by Invesco Advisers Inc. undertook the acquisition of shares at the final offer price  for an amount of 100 million euros  acting as cornerstone investors.Last week  Golden Goose  which was established in 2000  said the company is pursuing a growth strategy based on five pillars: continue nurturing leadership in sneakers; amplify brand awareness globally; evolve the group’s global presence; enhance the brand’s experiential journey  and selectively leverage new categories.From 2021 to 2023  Golden Goose reported a 23 percent compound annual growth rate in revenues and an earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization adjusted margin of around 34 percent last year.In 2023  the company registered sales of 587 million euros  an increase of 18 percent compared with 500.9 million euros in 2022  an adjusted EBITDA of 200 million euros  increasing 19 percent  and an adjusted operating profit 149 million euros  growing 22 percent.,neutral,0.06,0.9,0.04,mixed,0.2,0.3,0.5,True,English,"['Golden Goose Postpones', 'IPO', 'Luxury Goods Worldwide Market Study', '23 percent compound annual growth rate', 'personal luxury goods market', 'Carlyle Europe buyout fund', 'private equity fund', 'initial public offering', 'European Parliament elections', 'current sole shareholder', 'Invesco Advisers Inc.', 'European market volatility', 'current market backdrop', 'sustainable aftermarket performance', 'final offer price', 'European markets performance', 'Golden Goose capital', 'Golden Goose shares', 'growth strategy', 'luxury sector', 'luxury revenues', 'market source', 'market conditions', 'negative performance', 'market value', 'market capitalization', 'key markets', 'price tag', 'due course', 'first hour', 'investment community', 'significant deterioration', 'general election', 'right environment', 'consumer confidence', 'U.S.', 'first quarter', 'diverted spending', 'destination cities', 'Borsa Italiana', 'Astrum SapA', 'Astrum 4 Srl', 'five pillars', 'global presence', 'experiential journey', 'new categories', 'operating profit', 'price range', '1.86 billion euros', '1.28 billion euros', '100 million euros', '587 million euros', '500.9 million euros', '200 million euros', 'Thirty percent', 'IPO process', 'successful IPO', 'strong support', 'cornerstone investors', 'brand awareness', 'Euronext Milan', '10.50 euros', '4 percent', '18 percent', '19 percent', 'place', 'Friday', 'company', 'statement', 'decision', 'result', 'timing', 'suspension', 'response', 'book', 'demand', 'part', 'reception', 'story', 'calling', 'France', 'context', 'management', 'shareholders', 'stakeholders', 'Bain', 'Spring', 'Altagamma', 'China', 'terms', 'tourism', 'Japan', 'admission', 'Italy', 'watchdog', 'CONSOB', 'Permira', 'Funds', 'acquisition', 'amount', 'leadership', 'sneakers', 'group', 'earnings', 'interest', 'taxes', 'depreciation', 'amortization', 'margin', 'sales', 'increase', 'EBITDA', '9.50', '1.69']",2024-06-18,2024-06-19,wwd.com
