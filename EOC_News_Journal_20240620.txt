But the arsenal of political and economic countermeasures is wide.""Economists  lawyers and experts say one of Russia's most likely actions would be to confiscate foreign investors' financial assets and securities currently held in special ""type-C"" accounts  to which access has been blocked since the start of the war unless Moscow grants a waiver.Some 260 billion euros ($281 billion) in Russian assets such as central bank reserves have been frozen under sanctions imposed over Moscow's war in Ukraine. Around 190 billion euros of the assets are held in Euroclear  a Belgium-based central securities depository.European Union officials told Reuters last week that the bloc might provide about half of the $50 billion loan to Ukraine. However  Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni  the G7 summit host  later said the money would come from the United States  Canada  Britain and probably Japan and that EU states would not be directly involved for now.Zakharova said Russia had received ""direct signals"" from some G7 countries that they would not take part in such action ""because they understand the costs will be extremely painful"".

The vast majority are in Europe  particularly Belgium  with the Brussels-based company Euroclear holding some $192 billion in Russian assets.The details of the agreement — including who will fund the loan and how the money will be spent — are still being finalized with little information available to the public.In a statement released by the G7  the group noted that the loan was “without prejudice to possible other contributions ” leaving the door open to future confiscation of the assets themselves.While the $50 billion loan will not be able to cover the $486 billion recovery costs  estimated by the World Bank  it will be able to sustain Ukraine for a year  said Yuliya Ziskina  a senior legal fellow for the nonprofit advocacy group Razom for Ukraine.“This is an interim step  and that is not a substitute for full confiscation ” she said.She hailed the loan as a “breakthrough” and a catalyst for further conversations. However  she noted that the plan goes out of its way to avoid touching Russian assets.“We are moving in the right direction  but it's important to still keep our eyes on the ultimate goal ” she said.The event  which discussed ways to confiscate Russian assets in favor of Ukraine  was hosted by the Center for Economic Strategy (CES) in coordination with the International Center for Ukrainian Victory and KI Insights. KI Insights is an analytical unit backed by the Kyiv Independent.Kyiv suited up with international lawyers in the first weeks of the full-scale invasion in the hopes of seizing the assets quickly. But Ukraine has struggled to convince its allies to move on the issue of fully confiscating the frozen assets amid political debates.The G7 agreement is a cohesive step forward after two years fraught with disputes between Ukraine’s allies. Lobbying from opponents as well as disagreements over what the money should be used for held up decision-making while Ukraine struggled to cover its fiscal deficit and the cost of damages rose.France  Germany  Japan  and Italy are particularly resistant to the idea of full confiscation due to legal ramifications and a fear of catastrophic fallout in financial markets  according to the Financial Times.Opponents warn that Moscow could seize Western assets located in Russia following threats from Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov. Western companies are also worried that they will lose their business ventures and investments in Russia  according to Timothy Ash  a senior strategist at BlueBay Asset Management.Russian Presidential Press Secretary Dmitry Peskov (L) looks at Vladimir Putin (R) during the SCTO Summit on Nov. 23  2023  in Minsk  Belarus.

(Libkos/Getty Images)However  Washington managed to rally the four countries to back the $50 billion loan agreement. The White House has been one of the foremost proponents of Ukraine’s ambitions to fully seize Russian assets  having set the precedent with the REPO Act on April 20 that greenlit the path to confiscation in the U.S.Panelists asserted the importance of overcoming legal hurdles to secure the full worth of the assets. They also dismissed the concerns of hesitant EU members that Russia’s sovereign immunity could result in Moscow seeking legal action after the war.It is “well-established” in international law that assets can be legally confiscated from Russia and used to credit debts owed to Ukraine for damage  said Mykola Yurlov  deputy director of the International Cooperation and Representation Department in the Justice Ministry.The potential economic risks of investors fleeing Europe have failed to materialize  he said. He noted that reports from the European Central Bank show a strengthening positioning for foreign investment despite ongoing debates around confiscation.That leaves the main roadblock a “political fear of action ” by European countries  Yurlov said. He warned that the consequences of inaction could be far more disastrous than the potential effects of confiscation.“The fear of not taking action would be the collapse of Ukraine  and our defeat in the war and then potential further encroachment of Russia ” he said.This political fear has fallen over time  noted Bohdan Karnaukh  an analyst with the Institute of Legislative Ideas  a Ukrainian think-tank that since 2022 has been tracking global shifts in attitudes regarding the confiscation of Russian assets.In this handout image provided by German Government Press Office (BPA)  German Chancellor Olaf Scholz (center  L) and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau (center  R) listen to Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky (C) in Fasano  Italy on June 13  2024.

(Steffen Kugler/Bundesregierung via Getty Images)In addition to the recently announced G7 step  Karnaukh pointed to U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen  who previously raised significant legal risks about confiscation  but has since changed her stance and is calling on partners to embrace this approach.Backing a loan with frozen assets is an “extremely positive” signal for future confiscation  said Roman Sulzhyk  a financier and member of the supervisory board of CES.He believes that the assets will stay frozen until they are eventually confiscated and legally handed to Ukraine as reparations.“Even if (Russian forces) collapse the front today or (former President Donald) Trump comes to power and they force (Ukraine) to sign some shameful peace agreement … they will not be able to unfreeze these assets until the people who loaned the $50 billion are actually paid (back) ” he said.KI InsightsVisit KI Insights to learn more and subscribe to the insider weekly newslettervisit ki insightsWe’ve been working hard to bring you independent  locally-sourced news from Ukraine.

Discover SCENEHashdex  a global crypto-focused asset manager  announced Wednesday that it will waive all fees for its Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index Europe (HASH) fund until it reaches $1 billion in net asset value.The news comes as Hashdex pushes to offer a first-of-its-kind joint Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) in the U.S. that will hold both Bitcoin and Ethereum.Its HASH fund—an Exchange Traded Product (ETP)—is the second largest crypto index ETP in Europe  with over $100 million in net asset value. HASH is currently listed on the SIX Swiss Exchange  Deutsche Börse Xetra  Euronext Paris  and Euronext Amsterdam.“Hashdex believes that participating in the long-term promise of crypto is best fulfilled by gaining exposure to multiple digital assets through a best-in-class index ” Marcelo Sampaio  Hashdex co-founder and CEO  said in a press release. “We see a tremendous opportunity to invite more European investors into the crypto ecosystem with this fee waiver.”ADADCalling it an “extraordinary incentive ” Sampaio said the move will encourage investors to hold assets across the crypto ecosystem.The Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index (NCI)  developed in collaboration with Nasdaq  has quickly established itself as a leading index for crypto ETFs and ETPs globally  the company said.Hashdex's proposed joint Bitcoin and Ethereum ETF  if approved  would track the NCI and include cash holdings along with crypto. Coinbase Custody and BitGo would be its designated custodians.The NCI is a market-capitalisation-weighted index  meaning the fund would primarily hold Bitcoin (70.54%) and Ethereum (29.46%)  mirroring the relative weightings of these two dominant cryptocurrencies.ADADHashdex began offering a Bitcoin spot ETF in April. While it withdrew its application to offer an Ethereum spot ETF last month  it remains a significant player in a year of milestones for crypto funds in the U.S.Edited by Ryan Ozawa.,neutral,0.1,0.89,0.01,positive,0.51,0.47,0.03,True,English,"['Hopeful Hashdex Waives Fees', 'Ethereum ETF', 'Europe Fund', 'Bitcoin', 'second largest crypto index ETP', 'Deutsche Börse Xetra', 'The Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index', 'global crypto-focused asset manager', 'Hashdex Nasdaq Crypto Index Europe', 'joint Exchange Traded Fund', 'Exchange Traded Product', 'net asset value', 'SIX Swiss Exchange', 'two dominant cryptocurrencies', 'multiple digital assets', 'Bitcoin spot ETF', 'Ethereum spot ETF', 'class index', 'leading index', 'market-capitalisation-weighted index', 'The NCI', 'crypto ecosystem', 'crypto ETFs', 'crypto funds', 'joint Bitcoin', 'exclusive reports', 'key insights', 'Entertainment Hub', 'U.S.', 'Euronext Paris', 'Euronext Amsterdam', 'long-term promise', 'press release', 'tremendous opportunity', 'fee waiver', 'Ethereum ETF', 'cash holdings', 'Coinbase Custody', 'relative weightings', 'significant player', 'Ryan Ozawa', 'HASH) fund', 'HASH fund', 'Alpha Reports', 'Marcelo Sampaio', 'European investors', 'AD AD', 'research', 'access', 'airdrops', 'NFTs', 'game', 'Decrypt', 'Fashion', 'SCENE', 'fees', 'news', 'kind', 'exposure', 'founder', 'CEO', 'move', 'collaboration', 'ETPs', 'company', 'BitGo', 'custodians', 'April', 'application', 'year', 'milestones']",2024-06-19,2024-06-20,decrypt.co

Photograph: Dara Mac DónaillOfficials from the Euronext Dublin stock exchange and the wider Irish capital markets ecosystem are pressing the Government to launch a tax-friendly retail investment plan along the lines of the popular individual savings accounts (ISAs) scheme launched in the UK 25 years ago  according to sources.Proposals submitted to the Department of Finance in an attempt to reboot initial public offerings (IPOs) on the Irish stock market call for the establishment of a so-called Irish Growth Capital Fund to act as a cornerstone investor in flotations  the sources said. The State-owned Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) could be an anchor participant in this fund which would be backed by capital committed by the pillar banks and others  it has been suggested.It is not clear whether there is any appetite in ISIF to participate in such a fund.The document  filed with the department in May in advance of Budget 2025  also reiterated long-standing calls from Euronext  owner of the Irish Stock Exchange  for the introduction of tax incentives to allow company founders to sell some of their shares as part of a flotation.READ MORERepresentatives for Euronext Dublin did not respond to attempts to secure comment.There is a growing sense of urgency to find ways to revive the IPO market in Ireland  given the dearth of stock market flotations in recent years  the recent exits of the two largest companies on the Iseq 20 – CRH and Flutter Entertainment – and the imminent departure of another heavyweight  Smurfit Kappa.Only three companies have come to the market in Dublin in the past five years. The number of companies on the Iseq has fallen by more than 50 per cent since 2007 to 26 today.The UK ISA scheme  launched in 1999  allows individuals to invest as much as £20 000 a year in various types of savings accounts  ranging from interest-earning cash ISAs to stock ISAs. Income and capital gains from investments in ISAs are exempt from tax.The UK government announced plans earlier this year to set up a “British ISA”  with additional tax incentives  to encourage small-time investors to put money into London-listed stocks.The Government here would be prohibited by EU state-aid rules from launching a similar scheme aimed at incentivising investment in stocks on the Iseq. A wider scheme focused on stocks across the EU would be of limited benefit to the Irish market.Still  the umbrella group that worked on the pitch – comprising senior figures from Euronext Dublin and firms spanning stockbroking  corporate law  accountancy and financial public relations – has been emboldened by comments from Minister for Finance Michael McGrath last month that he was weighing tax changes to make it more attractive for people to invest their savings rather than have money sitting in low-yielding bank accounts.Mr McGrath told The Irish Times last week that his officials are considering tax incentives as part of a review his department has been carrying out on the Irish funds sector  which is nearing completion.“I don’t know what the recommendations are going to be yet in respect of retail participation and taxation  but I have asked them to look particularly closely at that ” he said. “And they understand what my policy objective is  which is to achieve greater [investment] participation by individual savers.”Separately  Euronext Dublin is said to be weighing the notion of developing a so-called Euronext Access market  similar to ones operated by the wider group in Paris  Brussels and Lisbon. These are designed especially for start-ups and small companies that wish to join a stock exchange to finance growth and gain the reputational advantages of listing but do not meet the criteria for admission to main or even junior Euronext markets.,neutral,0.15,0.82,0.03,negative,0.02,0.25,0.73,True,English,"['Irish stock exchange owner', 'UK individual savings accounts', 'retail investor scheme', 'The State-owned Ireland Strategic Investment Fund', 'wider Irish capital markets ecosystem', 'Dara Mac Dónaill', 'tax-friendly retail investment plan', 'popular individual savings accounts', 'The UK ISA scheme', 'Irish Growth Capital Fund', 'The Irish Times', 'Euronext Dublin stock exchange', 'junior Euronext markets', 'Irish funds sector', 'Irish Stock Exchange', 'initial public offerings', 'financial public relations', 'low-yielding bank accounts', 'greater [investment] participation', 'past five years', 'Irish stock market', 'two largest companies', 'interest-earning cash ISAs', 'EU state-aid rules', 'Euronext Access market', 'Finance Michael McGrath', 'additional tax incentives', 'stock market flotations', 'Irish market', 'wider scheme', 'retail participation', 'capital gains', 'British ISA', 'individual savers', 'wider group', 'stock ISAs', 'ISAs) scheme', 'recent years', 'similar scheme', 'Mr McGrath', 'IPO market', 'growing sense', 'cornerstone investor', 'anchor participant', 'pillar banks', 'long-standing calls', 'company founders', 'recent exits', 'Flutter Entertainment', 'imminent departure', 'Smurfit Kappa', 'three companies', '50 per cent', 'various types', 'small-time investors', 'limited benefit', 'umbrella group', 'senior figures', 'corporate law', 'tax changes', 'policy objective', 'small companies', 'reputational advantages', 'UK government', 'London-listed stocks', 'urgency', 'ways', 'Photograph', 'Officials', 'lines', 'sources', 'Proposals', 'Department', 'attempt', 'IPOs', 'establishment', 'ISIF', 'others', 'appetite', 'document', 'May', 'advance', 'Budget', 'owner', 'introduction', 'shares', 'READ', 'Representatives', 'comment', 'dearth', 'Iseq', 'CRH', 'heavyweight', 'number', 'individuals', 'Income', 'investments', 'plans', 'money', 'pitch', 'firms', 'stockbroking', 'accountancy', 'Minister', 'people', 'review', 'completion', 'recommendations', 'respect', 'taxation', 'notion', 'Paris', 'Brussels', 'Lisbon', 'start-ups', 'listing', 'criteria', 'admission', 'main']",2024-06-19,2024-06-20,irishtimes.com

The electrolysis plant in the innovation hub of DB Energie  a Group subsidiary  has an annual production capacity of up to 30 tons (installed electrolysis capacity of 1 MW). The green electricity comes from Deutsche Bahn's green electricity portfolio.At the Tübingen innovation hub  DB Energie is testing new technologies for sustainable rail energy supply  including in the ""H2goesRail"" project. Using the green hydrogen produced  a climate-neutral hydrogen train will be put into operation this year on a test route in Baden-Württemberg - between Tübingen  Horb and Pforzheim.""This project demonstrates the economic viability of hydrogen solutions in the transport and mobility sector. Sustainable energy sources and innovative technologies are needed to decarbonize the transport sector. One of these technologies is hydrogen-powered trains  which are a clean and efficient alternative to conventional diesel-powered trains as they are virtually CO2-free. The H2goesRail project is a pioneer in the field of passenger and freight transportation "" says Luc Graré  Head of Central and Eastern Europe at Lhyfe.With this project  Lhyfe wants to gain experience for a largely autonomously operated system  as well as the direct coupling of hydrogen production with a filling station on a large scale. The commissioning of the complex system with its many different dynamics  from production to multiple compression  storage and refueling of the hydrogen  is a particular challenge. Lhyfe is taking on this challenge in order to provide Deutsche Bahn and subsequent partners with a hydrogen production plant that can be used to test the integration of green hydrogen production into customer processes.Lhyfe develops customized solutions throughout Europe for the construction of local production and distribution systems for green hydrogen. The site in Tübingen is Lhyfe's first plant in Germany. Another 10 MW plant is currently being built in Schwäbisch Gmünd  which will produce up to 4 tons of green hydrogen per day. Lhyfe aims to become a major player in the mobility and industry sector  through customer deliveries in tube trailer (bulk) in France and Germany by 2025. Several other sites throughout Europe are already under construction or being expanded. Lhyfe has been operating its first green hydrogen site in France since the second half of 2021  and two other sites were opened in France in 2023.About LhyfeLhyfe is a European group devoted to energy transition  and a producer and supplier of green and renewable hydrogen. Its production sites and portfolio of projects intend to provide access to green and renewable hydrogen in industrial quantities  and enable the creation of a virtuous energy model capable of decarbonising entire sectors of industry and transport.In 2021  Lhyfe inaugurated the 1st industrial-scale green hydrogen production plant in the world to be interconnected with a wind farm. In 2022  it inaugurated the 1st offshore green hydrogen production pilot platform in the world.

ALTUVOCT is a high-sustained factor VIII replacement therapy for all ages and any disease severity. Children  adolescents  and adults can experience non-haemophilia factor VIII activity levels (above 40%) for a significant part of the week with once-weekly prophylaxis  reaching trough levels of 15% in adults and adolescents before the next dose. This results in significantly improved protection from bleeds compared to prior factor VIII prophylaxis.The European Commission also endorsed the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommendation supporting ALTUVOCT's retention of orphan drug designation  granting a 10-year market exclusivity period. The EMA recommendation noted that even considering existing treatments  once-weekly ALTUVOCT prophylaxis demonstrated a significantly lowered annual bleeding rate compared to other factor VIII products  and this constitutes a clinically relevant advantage.""Despite advancements  haemophilia still limits the possibilities of patients' lives and this means there is still a need for treatments that offer elevated protection. ALTUVOCT's high-sustained factor VIII activity and once-weekly dosing schedule have the potential to significantly improve quality of life for people with haemophilia A. The trials demonstrated substantial improvements in the prevention and treatment of bleeds along with significant improvements in physical health  pain  and joint health "" said Professor Robert Klamroth  MD  PhD  Head of the Department of Internal Medicine  Vascular Medicine and Coagulation Disorders at the Vivantes Klinikum Friedrichshain  Berlin  Germany.The granting of Marketing Authorisation is based on the results from the pivotal phase 3 studies: XTEND-1 in adults and adolescents and XTEND-Kids in children  which evaluated the efficacy and safety of ALTUVOCT in people with severe haemophilia A. These studies demonstrated that once-weekly ALTUVOCT prophylaxis (50 IU/kg) provided significant bleed protection for any age (mean ABR <1 and 80-88% of patients free from spontaneous bleeds). The outcomes also showed substantial improvement in joint health  physical health  pain and overall quality of life when comparing week 52 and baseline assessments.1 2 No factor VIII inhibitors were observed in the ALTUVOCT clinical program.""Today's announcement marks a major step forward in haemophilia care  offering the potential to significantly improve treatment outcomes and quality of life. For the first time  factor VIII activity levels can be sustained for a significant part of the week with simplified once-weekly dosing. We are proud to work alongside the haemophilia community  as we lead the paradigm shift towards normal haemostasis and create new possibilities together "" said Lydia Abad-Franch  MBA  Head of Research  Development  and Medical Affairs  and Chief Medical Officer at Sobi.Haemophilia A is a rare  lifelong genetic condition in which the body does not produce enough  or makes dysfunctional  factor VIII - a protein that is essential for blood clotting.

Efanesoctocog alfa builds on the established Fc fusion technology by innovatively adding a region of von Willebrand factor and XTEN® polypeptides to extend its time in circulation. It is the only therapy that has been shown to break through the von Willebrand factor ceiling  which imposes a half-life limitation on current factor VIII therapies.

Based on a customer-centric approach and supported by a recurring and sustainable business model  the new strategic plan “Elevate to 2030” provides a solid financial outlook based on faster long-term recurring revenue growth  higher profitability and a disciplined capital allocation policy over the period.Geoffrey Godet  Chief Executive Officer of Quadient S.A.  stated: “In 2019  after I joined Quadient  we embarked into a first strategic plan aiming at transforming the Company and setting it onto a sustainable and profitable growth trajectory. We successfully closed this plan earlier this year with the FY 2023 results  turning Quadient into a company focused on creating shareholders value by leveraging its existing asset base and delivering growing recurring revenue. Today  I am pleased to introduce Quadient’s new strategic plan: Elevate to 2030.Elevate to 2030 is our commitment to accelerate the existing growth trajectory and propel Quadient as the leader in intelligent automation. Our strategic plan is built upon four simple yet powerful key pillars. First  we focus on customers with a greater value proposition powered by our innovative automation platform leveraging Artificial Intelligence. Second  we drive higher recurring revenue through more cross-selling  increased customer penetration and market share gains. Third  we continue to raise the bar in terms of sustainability through ambitious ESG goals and a commitment to achieving Net Zero by 2050. Finally  all this translates into a strong investment proposition. Our ambition is to reach  by 2030  more than €1 billion in subscription-related revenue and more than €250 million in current EBIT  with an accelerating trend driven by the favorable change in business mix. Our plan is supported by a disciplined capital allocation policy over the period. This new journey will give us the opportunity to grow our Digital and Lockers automation platforms further  in two rapidly expanding and yet underpenetrated markets  while continuing to leverage on our Mail customer base to accelerate that growth. Supported by a long-term history of innovation and global capabilities  Quadient is now on an attractive sustainable and profitable growth journey.”A superior value proposition that meets powerful market trendsQuadient’s vision is to power the world’s most trusted connections between businesses  their data and their customers. The business world is increasingly driven by the need for more digitalization  the higher use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and automation  the constant rise of e-commerce and greater consideration of ESG criteria. Being at the junction of these four main business trends  Quadient is supporting businesses of all sizes in their digital transformation and growth journey to unlock operating efficiency with reliable  secure and sustainable automation solutions. Thanks to its scalable  flexible and reliable Intelligent automation platform  Quadient provides its customers with a superior value proposition that positioned the company as a partner of choice for intelligent  sustainable and compliant digital transformation. Its intelligent automation platform accelerates the transition towards digital connections  using AI-powered automation features to process large volumes of complex data. The platform also automates mail and parcels management while providing differentiated and seamless digital customer experience. Additionally  Quadient’s solutions bring positive ESG impact through the reduction of CO 2 emissions  thanks notably to the remanufacturing of mailing equipment  the digitalization of documents and connections  as well as the greater efficiency of parcel pick-up and delivery.With three automation platforms (Digital  Mail and Lockers) built on a common subscription business model  Quadient aims at delivering growth through a two-pronged go-to-market approach based on acquisition of new customers and expansion within the existing base. Operating in attractive markets  Quadient targets to add c.16 000 additional customers and locker installations every year continuing to build on an already at-scale customer base. The Company is also committed to leveraging this large existing base of c.350 000 customers by cross-selling and up-selling its wide range of applications. Indeed  the uniqueness and key differentiator of Quadient lies in that ability to sell several applications to an existing customer whether it is cross-selling (sale of an additional application from a second business line) or upselling (sale of a second application within the same business line). Successfully penetrating a customer account boosts its lifetime value and Quadient anticipates that c.70% of the 2030 growth ambition will originate from its expansion strategy.This growth strategy is supported by global capabilities at Company level  combining years of expertise in R&D and innovation with an integrated supply chain and support organization allowing for a sustainable approach to product manufacturing and costs savings. With over 550 engineers and developers and 6 R&D centers worldwide  Quadient is well equipped to further develop new innovative services and continue to improve its existing applications. From a supply chain and support standpoint  Quadient’s integrated approach optimizes logistics flows and customer support functions by sharing these capabilities across the Company and on a global scale.DigitalQuadient’s Digital automation platform offers an array of high value cloud-based software applications available through SaaS subscriptions. These applications include customer journey mapping  invoice-to-cash  procure-to-pay  communication management  document automation  intelligent forms  and hybrid mail. They are delivered through an integrated cloud platform featuring services such as a centralized control panel  value-added services  add-on capabilities  AI-powered digital interactions  and integrated support  also enabling access to other applications. By addressing many business pain points  Quadient’s digital automation offering brings unquestionable customer benefits  from cost benefits to greater convenience and strictest compliance.In the core geographies where Quadient operates  the addressable demand for its Digital automation platform is set to grow from c.€6 billion in 2023 to c.€9 billion in 2027  providing significant growth opportunities  both in communication automation and financial automation. Particularly  Quadient is uniquely positioned to drive compelling value from new regulatory e-invoicing initiatives within the European Union. Quadient is leveraging the innovation of its Digital automation platform and building on the strong invoice generation  delivery and information ingestion capabilities that already exist across its applications. Managing e-invoicing is core to the Quadient offering and common service delivered by the platform  extensible to all Quadient Digital customers. In addition  Quadient participates in several alliances that are working on defining the standards for e-invoicing. This enables Quadient to remain an active participant in this evolving field and adapt over time to potential change  in order to continue to bring the best and most efficient invoice-to-cash and procure-to-pay solutions to its customers.To capture this growth  Quadient will be relying on an efficient go-to-market to solicit both new customers through direct sales and partners  and existing mail customers through cross-selling.For the 2024-2026 period  Quadient provides an indicative trajectory of c.10% organic CAGR in Digital revenue and targets an EBITDA margin greater than 20% in 2026. Quadient’s 2030 ambition for its Digital business is to reach more than €500 million in revenue  with over 90% of subscription-related revenue  and an EBITDA margin of c.30%.MailQuadient’s Mail automation platform combines both hardware equipment (franking machines  folder-inserters  letter openers  addressing systems  rating scales) and its associated software and digital printing functionalities. In most cases  the equipment is placed through rental or leasing contracts. The highly automated services provided by Quadient’s Mail automation platform deliver tangible customer benefits  including labor cost savings associated with greater efficiency  cost benefits generated by access to the best and most accurate postage rates  higher convenience thanks to in-house mail creation and better compliance with proof of mailing integrity  audit trails and tracking.Against the backdrop of a steady decline in mail volumes  Quadient’s addressable demand for its Mail automation core market segments should drop from c. €2.4 billion in 2023 to c. €2.0 billion in 2027. Quadient  however  believes that its Mail revenue will continue to show resilience  declining only slowly and gradually thanks to a continuous investment effort in innovation to upgrade its offering and its ability to gain market share. Quadient is also best positioned to support its customers with both their digital mail and parcel automation needs through effective cross-selling  allowing for an extension of the customer relationship beyond mail and an increase in revenue per customer.Quadient’s indicative trajectory for the 2024-2026 period is of c.-3% organic CAGR in Mail revenue and a targeted EBITDA margin greater than 25% in 2026. Quadient’s 2030 ambitions for Mail is to have more c.€600 million in revenue  including more than 65% subscription-related revenue  and an EBITDA margin between 20% and 25%.LockersQuadient’s Lockers automation platform provides a series of applications dedicated to parcel pick up and returns. Parcel lockers and drop boxes are set either indoors or outdoors  equipped with security cameras and available on a 24/7 basis. Quadient’s Lockers automation platform has two main categories: open network infrastructure and sales & rentals of lockers for private use. Regarding open networks  Quadient deploys and operates an infrastructure of lockers in selected countries (France  Japan  the UK). This infrastructure of lockers is used on a fee per parcel model by large international and domestic carriers. Typical locations for these parcel lockers include train stations  gas stations  car parks or supermarkets. On the other hand  in the same countries as well as in the United States  Quadient equips targeted verticals including residences  universities  retailers and distributors with parcel lockers for the specific needs of residents  students  retail consumers and shoppers. Customer benefits range from reduced delivery and collection costs to 24/7 availability  greater convenience and experience  improved security of parcel delivery and reduced CO 2 emissions in city centers.The expansion of e-commerce is the main driving force supporting automated lockers’ demand growth. In the core geographies where Quadient operates  the addressable market for its Lockers automation platform is set to grow at a pace of over 10% p.a. on average from c.€400m in 2023 to c.€600m in 2027. Together with the rise in online retail  parcel volumes growth is also boosted by the increase in the level of returns as well as the growing C2C market. To capture this growth  Quadient is looking at expanding its footprint  securing new sites to install more lockers. Indeed  together with innovative features  density of the lockers network to reach critical proximity is a key driver to foster adoption and increase usage. Quadient also continues to innovate  with services being added to its locker services such as the award-winning drop box to consolidate returns.For the 2024-2026 period  Quadient provides an indicative trajectory of more than 10% organic CAGR in Lockers revenue and targets an EBITDA margin greater than 10% in 2026  with EBITDA breakeven point being reached as soon as FY 2024. Quadient’s 2030 ambition for Lockers is to reach an installed base of more than 40 000 lockers  more than €200 million in revenue  and an EBITDA margin of c.20%.Stronger ESG commitmentsTo fulfill Quadient’s long-term sustainable growth ambition  the “Elevate to 2030” strategic plan includes strong ESG commitments towards its customers  its people and communities  and the environment.Towards its customers  Quadient aims at building trust through market-leading applications  i.e. applications helping customers to reduce the environmental impact of each transaction and ensuring security and data protection. It also involves relying on an ethical and responsible supply chain. Targets set for 2026 include notably: 95% customer satisfaction  life-cycle assessments covering 80% of the applications portfolio  ISO 27001 certification extension from Digital to Lockers R&D centers  85% code of conduct endorsement by strategic business partners  with 30% of them committed to reduce their carbon footprint.Towards its people and communities  Quadient aims at providing its team with career opportunities based on a competitive rewards program  assessing gender pay gap and adequate wage  nurturing a diverse  equitable and inclusive workforce  and forging meaningful partnerships that positively impact the company’s communities. Targets set for 2026 include: 35% of women representation within management  75% inclusion index score  and 5 000 volunteering hours dedicated to communities every year by 2026.Towards the environment  Quadient seeks to reduce its impact on the planet with a climate strategy designed to achieve zero carbon emissions by 2050  implying the decarbonation of its applications all along their lifecycle as well as responsible manufacturing and recycling. Targets set for 2026 include: at least 50% of placement of mail products stemming from remanufacturing  and at least 90% of the company’s industrial waste recycled. Regarding GHG emissions  the scope 1 & 2 targets for 2030 were initially set at -50% vs. 2018; considering the -55% reached in 2023  Quadient is now targeting -64% by 2030 in line with SBTi targets  with an intermediary target of -59% set for 2026 (targets yet to be approved by SBTi). The scope 3 target for 2030 remains at -30% vs 2018.A strong investment propositionWhile further deploying cross-selling opportunities and value-creation synergies across its businesses  Quadient will continue to leverage its leadership positions. Additional growth and higher profitability will stem from the solid recurring revenue generated by its automation platforms and the ability to drive innovative applications. Quadient is therefore guiding for a greater than 1.5% organic revenue CAGR over 2024-2026  and a twice-as-fast organic current EBIT CAGR with a minimum of 3% for the period 2024-2026. The 2024 financial guidance is confirmed with organic growth expected at revenue and current EBIT levels.The dynamics at play within Quadient’s portfolio of businesses  i.e. a double-digit growth in Digital and Lockers revenues and an only moderate decline in Mail revenue will mechanically generate a year after year acceleration in Quadient’s total revenue growth.Quadient’s ambitions for 2030 are to have more than €1.3 billion of total revenue  including more than €1 billion of subscription-related revenue (an increase of more than €250 million vs. 2023)  and a current EBIT of c.€250 million (an increase of c.€100 million vs. 2023).In the meantime  Quadient will maintain a disciplined capital allocation policy. Quadient’s strategic approach will continue to be based on an ongoing assessment of its invested capital to maximize long-term value for its shareholders.Capital expenditure (capex) is expected to average at c. €100 million per year for the 2024-2026 period  to be compared with an average of €93 million over the 2021-2023 period. The slight increase will be due in part to Digital R&D activities for its platform development and – to a higher extent – to the deployment of the parcel lockers open network in the UK and France. Mail capex is expected to remain stable and mostly linked to new rented equipment.In addition to organic investments  potential opportunistic acquisitions may be considered to strengthen the platforms  while Quadient will also continue to keep a flexible approach to its portfolio.Thanks to continuously strong and recurring free cash-flow generation  Quadient aims at maintaining a healthy  yet efficient balance sheet by bringing further down its net debt excluding leasing/EBITDA excluding leasing ratio to 1.5x in 2026.Finally  Quadient’s shareholder return policy will continue to be based on a dividend pay-out ratio of minimum 20% of net income while considering the use of excess cash to perform share buybacks  subject to value-creation criteria._________To know more about Quadient’s news flow  previous press releases are available on our website at the following address: https://invest.quadient.com/en/newsroom.AppendixDigital: New name for Intelligent Communication AutomationMail: New name for Mail-Related SolutionsLockers: New name for Parcel Locker SolutionsCONFERENCE CALL & WEBCASTQuadient will host its Capital Markets Day in Paris today at 9:00 am CET.A livestream webcast and a replay will be accessible at the following address: WebcastA replay of the webcast will also be available on Quadient’s Investor Relations website for 12 months.Calendar23 September 2024: H1 2024 results and Q2 2024 revenue27 November 2024: Q3 2024 revenueAbout Quadient®Quadient is a global automation platform provider powering secure and sustainable business connections through digital and physical channels.

Quadient’s 2030 ambition for Lockers is to reach an installed base of more than 40 000 lockers  more than €200 million in revenue  and an EBITDA margin of c.20%.Stronger ESG commitmentsTo fulfill Quadient’s long-term sustainable growth ambition  the “Elevate to 2030” strategic plan includes strong ESG commitments towards its customers  its people and communities  and the environment.Towards its customers  Quadient aims at building trust through market-leading applications  i.e. applications helping customers to reduce the environmental impact of each transaction and ensuring security and data protection. It also involves relying on an ethical and responsible supply chain. Targets set for 2026 include notably: 95% customer satisfaction  life-cycle assessments covering 80% of the applications portfolio  ISO 27001 certification extension from Digital to Lockers R&D centers  85% code of conduct endorsement by strategic business partners  with 30% of them committed to reduce their carbon footprint.Towards its people and communities  Quadient aims at providing its team with career opportunities based on a competitive rewards program  assessing gender pay gap and adequate wage  nurturing a diverse  equitable and inclusive workforce  and forging meaningful partnerships that positively impact the company’s communities. Targets set for 2026 include: 35% of women representation within management  75% inclusion index score  and 5 000 volunteering hours dedicated to communities every year by 2026.Towards the environment  Quadient seeks to reduce its impact on the planet with a climate strategy designed to achieve zero carbon emissions by 2050  implying the decarbonation of its applications all along their lifecycle as well as responsible manufacturing and recycling. Targets set for 2026 include: at least 50% of placement of mail products stemming from remanufacturing  and at least 90% of the company’s industrial waste recycled. Regarding GHG emissions  the scope 1 & 2 targets for 2030 were initially set at -50% vs. 2018; considering the -55% reached in 2023  Quadient is now targeting -64% by 2030 in line with SBTi targets  with an intermediary target of -59% set for 2026 (targets yet to be approved by SBTi). The scope 3 target for 2030 remains at -30% vs 2018.A strong investment propositionWhile further deploying cross-selling opportunities and value-creation synergies across its businesses  Quadient will continue to leverage its leadership positions. Additional growth and higher profitability will stem from the solid recurring revenue generated by its automation platforms and the ability to drive innovative applications. Quadient is therefore guiding for a greater than 1.5% organic revenue CAGR over 2024-2026  and a twice-as-fast organic current EBIT CAGR with a minimum of 3% for the period 2024-2026. The 2024 financial guidance is confirmed with organic growth expected at revenue and current EBIT levels.The dynamics at play within Quadient’s portfolio of businesses  i.e. a double-digit growth in Digital and Lockers revenues and an only moderate decline in Mail revenue will mechanically generate a year after year acceleration in Quadient’s total revenue growth.Quadient’s ambitions for 2030 are to have more than €1.3 billion of total revenue  including more than €1 billion of subscription-related revenue (an increase of more than €250 million vs. 2023)  and a current EBIT of c.€250 million (an increase of c.€100 million vs. 2023).In the meantime  Quadient will maintain a disciplined capital allocation policy. Quadient’s strategic approach will continue to be based on an ongoing assessment of its invested capital to maximize long-term value for its shareholders.Capital expenditure (capex) is expected to average at c. €100 million per year for the 2024-2026 period  to be compared with an average of €93 million over the 2021-2023 period. The slight increase will be due in part to Digital R&D activities for its platform development and – to a higher extent – to the deployment of the parcel lockers open network in the UK and France. Mail capex is expected to remain stable and mostly linked to new rented equipment.In addition to organic investments  potential opportunistic acquisitions may be considered to strengthen the platforms  while Quadient will also continue to keep a flexible approach to its portfolio.Thanks to continuously strong and recurring free cash-flow generation  Quadient aims at maintaining a healthy  yet efficient balance sheet by bringing further down its net debt excluding leasing/EBITDA excluding leasing ratio to 1.5x in 2026.Finally  Quadient’s shareholder return policy will continue to be based on a dividend pay-out ratio of minimum 20% of net income while considering the use of excess cash to perform share buybacks  subject to value-creation criteria._________To know more about Quadient’s news flow  previous press releases are available on our website at the following address: https://invest.quadient.com/en/newsroom.AppendixDigital: New name for Intelligent Communication AutomationMail: New name for Mail-Related SolutionsLockers: New name for Parcel Locker SolutionsCONFERENCE CALL & WEBCASTQuadient will host its Capital Markets Day in Paris today at 9:00 am CET.A livestream webcast and a replay will be accessible at the following address: WebcastA replay of the webcast will also be available on Quadient’s Investor Relations website for 12 months.Calendar23 September 2024: H1 2024 results and Q2 2024 revenue27 November 2024: Q3 2024 revenueAbout Quadient®Quadient is a global automation platform provider powering secure and sustainable business connections through digital and physical channels.

Barry O’Halloran reports on how that likely means delays and cancellations in the weeks ahead while Conor Pope sets out the rules around compensation to which disrupted passengers will be entitled and Colin Gleeson talks to travel agents who say demand for Aer Lingus seats has already flatlined in news that is bound to concern executives at the airline.Housing is also in the news with the Department of Finance saying that building 50 000 homes a year in line with recent suggested targets will require funding of €20.4 billion a year  more than 80 per cent of it coming form private sources. A separate update from the Department of Housing says that a similar number of homes have been granted planning permission over the past three years under new planning rules that restrict bulk buying by investment funds or other groups.
