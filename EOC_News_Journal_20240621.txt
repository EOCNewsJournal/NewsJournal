Per Cointelegraph  they made a point of saying that if it were to be authorized  it would be the first Solana ETP listed in North America.In connection with its initial public offering  3iQ informed X on June 20 that they had submitted a preliminary prospectus for The Solana Fund (QSOL) in Canada.Native SOL staking yields also provide an opportunity for QSOL holders to earn interest. According to the company  staking yields are currently between 6 and 8 percent. Solana staking for QSOL would be enabled using Coinbase Custody's institutional staking infrastructure  which would be provided by Tetra Trust as a custodian.Expanding 3iQ's ETF PortfolioAdditionally  the Canadian firm is responsible for the 3iQ Bitcoin ETF (BTCQ) and the 3iQ Ether Staking ETF (ETHQ) on the TSE. They are also the brains behind The Ether Fund (QETH) and The Bitcoin Fund (QBTC).3iQ pointed out that  with the exception of Quebec  all provinces and territories in Canada had received QSOL on a preliminary prospectus from the securities regulatory authorities. QSOL will provide the ""daily price movements of the U.S. dollar price SOL"" and ""exposure to the digital currency SOL.""Solana's Growing Influence in the ETF Market​Crypto Briefing shares that Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas tweeted his disbelief as to why there haven't been more U.S. asset managers that have attempted similar filings in response to 3iQ's action  suggesting that this might be a strategic move to position themselves favorably in the event of a pro-crypto regulatory shift under a prospective new administration.Having debuted a Solana ETN on the Deutsche Börse in 2021  investment manager VanEck has been outspoken about its faith in Solana's potential.The spot ETF battles will see Solana enter in 2024  according to a 2023 assessment by Matthew Sigel and Patrick Bush of VanEck.

By design  TALE base editors do not create break within DNA strands as does CRISPR/Cas9  or other engineered nucleases  and is a promising therapeutic strategy for genetic diseases. A key aspect to broaden the scope of possible applications is our comprehension of design rules.TALE base editors rely on the deamination of cytidines within double strand DNA  leading to the formation of an uracil (U) intermediate. These molecular tools are fusions of transcription activator-like effector domains (TALE) for specific DNA sequence binding  split-DddA deaminase halves that will  upon catalytic domain reconstitution  initiate the conversion of a cytosine (C) to a thymine (T)  and an uracil glycosylase inhibitor (UGI).Previous works have pointed towards the positioning of targeted cytosine to be a key determinant for efficient editing.To extend the understanding of key determining factors allowing efficient TALE base editing (C-to-T conversion)  Cellectis investigated whether the nature (length and composition) of the linker that connects the TALE array with the split deaminase catalytic heads could impact C-to-T conversion within the editing window.The datasets presented in this paper highlight how three key factors  spacer length  TALEB architecture and composition of the surrounding bases  can impact editing outcomes and further improve our understanding of TALE base editors' activity and specificity  leading to the possibility to tune and control editing using educated designs.“This experimental strategy used by Cellectis to characterize editing profiles in depth and in a high throughput format could easily be applied to any new editors to continue expanding this platform for potential therapeutic applications ” said Maria Feola  Scientist III  Manager  Gene Editing at Cellectis.Research data specifically underlines the primordial importance of the positions preceding the targeted TC  which markedly increases editing efficiency.The article is available on Scientific Reports website by clicking on this link:https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-63203-8About CellectisCellectis is a clinical-stage biotechnology company using its pioneering gene-editing platform to develop life-saving cell and gene therapies.

The Company also provided operational updates.In connection with its two recent successful capital increases in February 2024 and May 2024  the Company initiated discussions with its creditors. As a result of these discussions  the Company and its creditors have renegotiated the terms and conditions of certain financial obligations.We continue to make progress in optimizing financial management to support our objectives  and we are grateful to our banking partners and creditors for their continued collaboration in our journey  commented Laurence Rodriguez  Chief Executive Officer of GenSight Biologics. The renegotiated terms will give GenSight additional operating flexibility as it works on its priorities.Renegotiation of the terms of state-guaranteed loansThe Company and its creditor banks (BNP Paribas (OTC: )  CIC and Bpifrance) (the ""Banks"")  previously agreed to suspend the payment of the principal  subject to certain conditions. The parties have now agreed to extend the maturity of the loans until December 2024 and to adopt a new payment schedule for the outstanding principal and interest  featuring 6 monthly instalments with gradual amortization (5% of outstanding principal per month over July  August and September 2024  and then 28.3% over October  November and December 2024).Renegotiation of the terms for the convertible bonds with Heights CapitalAs previously announced  an additional amendment to the price limit set forth in the terms and conditions of the convertible bonds issued on December 28  2022  to Heights Capital (the ""2022 OCA) was presented to the shareholders at the annual shareholders' general meeting (""AGM"") held on May 29  2024  and was approved as the 30th resolution of the AGM. This new price limit equals to €0.3272 (the ""Price Limit""1).The Company and Heights Capital previously decided to suspend the quarterly amortization payments for the redemption of the 2022 OCAs. In recently concluded discussions  the Company and Heights Capital have agreed that (i) the frozen quarterly amortization payments will be paid in accordance with the additional amortization rights mechanism contained in the terms and conditions of the 2022 OCAs and (ii) the quarterly amortization payment of the 2022 OCAs will resume through the issue of new shares by the Company starting from the amortization payment for June 28  2024.Ongoing renegotiation of the terms for loan tranche from the European Investment Bank (EIB)As previously announced  the withdrawal of the GS010 (LUMEVOQ ®) marketing authorization application in 2023 and the revision of the Company's manufacturing plans invalidated the conditions for drawing down the €12 million Tranche B of the EIB loan from November 2022. The EIB and the Company have agreed to continue negotiating new drawdown conditions for Tranche B.Working Capital StatementThe Company confirms that it has sufficient net working capital to meet its obligations until the second part of the third quarter of 2024. With the potential revenues generated by the resumption of AAC program  assuming the manufacture of the drug product batch for the AAC program is completed as planned  the Company anticipates that it would have sufficient net working capital to meet its obligations until the second quarter of 2025.Operational UpdatesThe Company remains on track to resume the early access program (AAC) for GS010 (LUMEVOQ ®) in France in Q3 2024. The blending of the two drug substance batches produced in 2023 is on track  and the Company has been in contact with the French medicines safety agency (ANSM) and Paris' Quinze-Vingts Hospital (the reference medical center where initial treatments for the AAC will take place) to secure operational readiness as soon as product becomes available in Q3 2024.The team is very much focused on having everything in place  so that patients  who we know have been waiting to be treated  can have access to the drug as soon as possible  said Magali Taiel  Chief Medical Officer of GenSight Biologics.

Most patients follow a course of developmental delay with cognitive  motor  and behavioral deficits that persist into adulthood. Dravet syndrome severely impacts quality of life for patients  families  and caregivers due to the high physical  emotional  caregiving  and financial burden associated with the disease.1 2 3About FINTEPLA ® (fenfluramine)4FINTEPLA is indicated for the treatment of seizures associated with Dravet syndrome (DS) and Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) in patients 2 years of age and older.FINTEPLA is available only through a restricted distribution program called the FINTEPLA Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS).

All statements  other than statements of historical facts  are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements  including estimates of revenues  operating margins  capital expenditures  cash  other financial information  expected legal  arbitration  political  regulatory or clinical results or practices and other such estimates and results. By their nature  such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and assumptions which might cause the actual results  financial condition  performance or achievements of UCB  or industry results  to differ materially from those that may be expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements contained in this press release. Important factors that could result in such differences include: changes in general economic  business and competitive conditions  the inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals or to obtain them on acceptable terms or within expected timing  costs associated with research and development  changes in the prospects for products in the pipeline or under development by UCB  effects of future judicial decisions or governmental investigations  safety  quality  data integrity or manufacturing issues; potential or actual data security and data privacy breaches  or disruptions of our information technology systems  product liability claims  challenges to patent protection for products or product candidates  competition from other products including biosimilars  changes in laws or regulations  exchange rate fluctuations  changes or uncertainties in tax laws or the administration of such laws  and hiring and retention of its employees. There is no guarantee that new product candidates will be discovered or identified in the pipeline  will progress to product approval or that new indications for existing products will be developed and approved. Movement from concept to commercial product is uncertain; preclinical results do not guarantee safety and efficacy of product candidates in humans. So far  the complexity of the human body cannot be reproduced in computer models  cell culture systems or animal models. The length of the timing to complete clinical trials and to get regulatory approval for product marketing has varied in the past and UCB expects similar unpredictability going forward. Products or potential products  which are the subject of partnerships  joint ventures or licensing collaborations may be subject to differences disputes between the partners or may prove to be not as safe  effective or commercially successful as UCB may have believed at the start of such partnership. UCB's efforts to acquire other products or companies and to integrate the operations of such acquired companies may not be as successful as UCB may have believed at the moment of acquisition. Also  UCB or others could discover safety  side effects or manufacturing problems with its products and/or devices after they are marketed. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of UCB's products that implicate an entire class of products may have a material adverse effect on sales of the entire class of affected products. Moreover  sales may be impacted by international and domestic trends toward managed care and health care cost containment  including pricing pressure  political and public scrutiny  customer and prescriber patterns or practices  and the reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers as well as legislation affecting biopharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement activities and outcomes. Finally  a breakdown  cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality  integrity and availability of UCB's data and systems.Given these uncertainties  you should not place undue reliance on any of such forward-looking statements.

This is an opportunity also for the Company to provide an update on its business development and outlook.Philippe HAFFNER  Co-founder and Chairman and CEO of HAFFNER ENERGY said:""For Haffner Energy  2023-2024 will remain a year of expanding our addressable markets. Faced with delays in the onset of the renewable hydrogen market  we are prioritizing market segments where we find the highest demand (SAF and syngas)  for which our offering is differentiating and value-creating both for our customers and ourselves. To this end  we have adapted our technology  notably with the commissioning of our Marolles industrial site.“This past financial year was both insignificant in terms of financial results  yet highly value-creating in terms of project portfolios in mature markets hungry for competitive decarbonization solutions. Our addressable market and sales prospects are now much higher than they have ever been. In fact  compared with the hydrogen market alone  Haffner Energy's overall target market has increased by a factor of more than 4. Furthermore  these complementary markets offer the advantage of making biomass an essential component in the composition of biofuels (syngas  SAF  methanol) and e-fuels. Furthermore  we are progressing our business model from technology supplier to project developer. The Paris-Vatry SAF project is a case in point. It is equivalent to the decarbonization of 3.6 billion passenger-km per year by Airbus A320neo planes.These new opportunities translate into exponential growth in our pipeline  far beyond anything we've seen to date; a potential which isn’t reflected yet in the Company's market capitalization.On the strength of these new commercial prospects  new high-quality strategic partnerships  and a more ambitious business plan  we are well positioned to launch a new round of financing to support projects that will create significant value. Based on our 30-year experience  our ability to provide immediate decarbonization solutions at scale through producing competitive biofuels  makes us confident that we can become a global leader in the energy transition. Our 10-year target is to help avoid over 90 million tonnes of CO 2 .""I. BUSINESS ACTIVITY: ORDER BOOK  NEW OFFERS  PIPELINE  AND GROWTH MARKETS2023-2024  a year of expansion into new markets in the context of the renewable hydrogen market’s slow onsetThe 2023-2024 financial year has been devoted to expanding Haffner Energy's technical and commercial offering to diversify and increase its addressable market. This  in the context of the slow onset of the renewable hydrogen ecosystem  particularly in Europe  with insufficient outlets and a lack of ""offtake-or-pay"" contracts making the financing of most projects difficult.This situation  which has led to a delay in the signing of new contracts  has also weighed on the execution of the order book we had built. The 2023-2024 financial year thus saw the termination or cancellation of our first contracts relating to renewable hydrogen production  such as the R-Hynoca contract  the termination of which was recorded on 12/13/2023 (see 12/14/2023 press release).As regards the future of the three (3) contracts signed with Carbonloop (one contract for the supply of renewable gas production equipment with a capacity of 500 kW and two contracts for the supply of renewable hydrogen)  it is now acknowledged that they will not be executed. The contracts had been suspended on 09/30/2023 (see 12/14/2023 press release) and the risk of cancellation from the order book had been announced.The recent receivership of Carbonloop SAS  the engineering company behind the projects  corroborates the fact that these contracts will not be pursued. This situation justifies the Company's decision  on 03/31/2024  to cancel the projects (€14.9M) from the order book  which stood at €1 230k at that date (invoices only  never recognized as deferred revenue).Haffner Energy and Carbonloop have a dispute concerning the execution of these contracts and a summary procedure before the Paris Commercial Court is underway. Haffner Energy is confident of a successful outcome.A change in pipeline size: €1.4B for projects in Europe and overseasSince its SAFNOCA® and SYNOCA® offerings launched last year in July and October respectively to address aviation and industry decarbonization  Haffner Energy has recorded an acceleration of its pipeline  from €300M at 03/31/2023 to €1.4B at 03/31/2024.In terms of opportunities by sector  industry became Haffner Energy's top short-term market during the 2023-2024 financial year  validating the commercial targeting announced in the second half of 2023.Geographically  we note the rise of North America  with several projects currently being explored in the United States  especially regarding SAF. Haffner Energy has thus succeeded in establishing itself and gaining traction in the U.S.  where its ambition recently shifted into higher gear with the creation of the US subsidiary Haffner Energy  Inc. (see 05/29/2024 press release ).II.

From being a supplier of technology for renewable hydrogen production  the Company is now positioning itself both as a supplier of biofuel production technology and as a producer of biofuels  as well as a project developer. A mandate has been given to Avolta  a European specialist in M&A and fundraising for innovative companies  to seek investors (debt and/or equity) to support the Company's development and its projects. The creation of combined value for the Company and its shareholders is a key objective of the planned transaction.III. PROJECTS AND PROSPECTS: FIRST FACTORY  MAROLLES TESTING AND TRAINING CENTRE  FIRST ""PARIS-VATRY"" SAF PROJECTSignificant advances for Haffner Energy's industrial system and showcase of know-howThe 2023-2024 fiscal year allowed Haffner Energy to advance its FactorHy project at Première Usine. Based in Saint-Dizier  France  this large-capacity plant will assemble renewable gas and hydrogen production modules. The objectives prevailing in the construction of this plant are:the control of quality  costs and time for assemblypotential for factory testing of strategic equipmentthe protection of intellectual propertySelected as part of France 2030 call-for-proposals program operated by Bpifrance and supported by local elected officials and institutional partners  the project has benefited throughout this fiscal year from the granting of major subsidies  including €5.9M from the State through France 2030 (including an advance of €1.47M received during the financial year  60% of which are subsidies and 40% are repayable advances).In addition to these €5.9M  other public funding of €5.7M and an additional agreement in principle of €1.3M have been secured. The realization of this project will require limited additional financing  mainly through bank loans.In addition  at the end of 2023  Haffner Energy launched the creation of a testing and training center in the Vitry-Marolles business park (Marne) near its headquarters. This center  which is designed to operate for 8 000 continuous hour per year  will perform tests on different types of biomass supplied by its customers— among other things. After several months of site preparation and equipment installation  the plant  equipped with new-generation standardized industrial production equipment  went into syngas production on 06/18/2024. Having received the green light from the authorities  Haffner Energy will add renewable hydrogen production (nominal capacity of 15 kg/hour) before the end of 2024. All in all  the plant will display the full range of possibilities offered by Haffner Energy's technology: from the production of renewable gas to the production of renewable hydrogen or even the co-production of electricity  from the production of biochar to its gasification...SAF: a first project undertaken with LanzaJet (Paris-Vatry SAF) and a confirmed potentialAs announced a year ago  Haffner Energy has adapted its disruptive technology to address the Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) market. The past year has confirmed the significance of the actual development potential for the Company  as it was approached by some of the biggest players in the sector.Haffner Energy just launched its first project for a Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production plant at Paris-Vatry airport (Marne  Grand-Est Region  France)  developed in collaboration with several public and private partners  first and foremost US company LanzaJet (see 06/06/ 2024 press release). This global leader in Alcohol-To-Jet (ATJ) technology is one of the most advanced players in the industry with more than 90 SAF projects in its portfolio. It was recently named on the prestigious ""TIME 100 Most Influential Companies"" list for 2024.
