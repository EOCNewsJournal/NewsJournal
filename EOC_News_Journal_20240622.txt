This country's jurisdiction also hosts the Euroclear depository  which holds most of the Russian frozen assets. ""Two things are of crucial important for our country — not to touch the assets themselves  as changing their ownership can have unpredictable consequences financially and legally. The second is sharing the risk — this is a very important issue in the creation of this tool  a key point in the whole discussion "" the minister told reporters.After the start of Russia’s military operation in Ukraine  the EU and G7 countries froze nearly half of Russia's foreign currency reserves  approximately 300 billion euros. More than 200 billion euros are held in the EU  primarily in accounts at Belgium's Euroclear — one of the largest settlement and clearing systems in the world. The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs described the freezing of Russian assets in Europe as theft  noting that the EU is targeting not only private funds but also Russia’s state assets. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated that Russia would respond if the frozen Russian assets in the West were confiscated. According to him  Russia also has the option of not returning the funds that Western countries hold in Russia.https://sputnikglobe.com/20240615/g7-countries-could-lose-83-billion-if-russias-assets-confiscated-1118969001.htmlrussiabelgiumukraineSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rosiya Segodnya“ 252 602024Sputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rosiya Segodnya“ 252 60Newsen_ENSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rosiya Segodnya“ 252 601920 1080 true1920 1440 true1920 1920 trueSputnik International feedback@sputniknews.com +74956456601 MIA „Rosiya Segodnya“ 252 60Sputnik Internationalbelgium  europe  frozen russian assets  why seizing frozen russian assets is bad idea  european union",negative,0.0,0.16,0.84,negative,0.0,0.18,0.82,True,English,"['Belgian Finance Minister', 'Unpredictable Fallout', 'Frozen Assets', 'Russia', 'EU', 'Belgian Finance Minister Vincent Van Peteghem', 'Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov', 'europe belgium ukraine european union', 'foreign currency reserves', 'The Russian Ministry', 'Russian frozen assets', 'frozen russian assets', 'Foreign Affairs', 'Unpredictable Fallout', 'Sputnik International', 'unpredictable consequences', 'Two things', 'important issue', 'key point', 'military operation', 'G7 countries', '300 billion euros', '200 billion euros', 'largest settlement', 'clearing systems', 'Western countries', 'Rosiya Segodnya', 'bad idea', 'state assets', 'Euroclear depository', 'private funds', 'economy russia', 'sputnikglobe', 'russian-assets', 'unpredictable-consequences', 'belgian-minister-warns', 'risks', 'loan', 'Friday', 'cdn1.', 'presidency', 'Council', 'end', 'month', 'country', 'jurisdiction', 'ownership', 'creation', 'tool', 'discussion', 'reporters', 'start', 'half', 'More', 'accounts', 'world', 'freezing', 'theft', 'option', 'g7-countries', 'russias', 'sputniknews', 'MIA']",2024-06-21,2024-06-22,sputnikglobe.com

But the western alliance is not as battle ready as Russia. The former has not innovated weapons sufficiently and doesn’t possess the hypersonic missiles of Russia  China and her allies. And the Europeans  including Britain  are too socially degraded as cohesive nations to recruit sufficient troops for their depleted armies. Talk of recruitment or even national service in these nations is unrealistic. It is not an exaggeration to say that politically  European NATO members are disintegrating.The pressure to go nuclear is mounting  particularly for America which wants Russia destroyed and has proved to be unconcerned with collateral damage to its allies. Her wars and operations in Iraq  Libya  Syria  and Afghanistan have created acute refugee problems in Europe. And countless Ukrainians have been slaughtered without any regret. But America can now only maintain her global dominance by unleashing a third world war. That she can retain European allies in this path to Europe’s own destruction is irrational. Who Paid The Piper : T... Frances Stonor Saunders Best Price: $12.67 Buy New $15.95 (as of 04:43 UTC - Details)Only last week at the G7 meeting in Italy  plans to sequester and divert interest on Russia’s reserves to fund Ukraine’s armaments were finalised. Legally  this is theft of Russia’s property. The West has signalled to the rest of the world its contempt for property rights — and Russia has made sure the world is aware of it.This is the year of Russia’s chairmanship of BRICS  to be followed by China in 2025. Not only is the membership due to be expanded  but having failed to get a gold-backed trade settlement onto the Johannesburg agenda last August we can be sure that Russia has updated her plans for this year’s meeting in Kazan in October. This article looks at how this might pan out.Meanwhile  the war in Ukraine is destroying that nation’s manhood mainly to save Biden’s skin in the presidential election in November. It is remarkable that in modern politics the callousness of Caesar in Gaul when he proudly massacred a million souls for his own glory is being repeated today. We look at Biden’s timing from Russia’s strategic point of view. And as defeat for NATO in Ukraine looms  America appears to be provoking China into precipitative action over Taiwan almost as a side bet.Led by America  an increasingly desperate western alliance is pushing these conflicts towards direct engagements with Russia and China. Though far from an exhaustive list  the following questions arise:· Has the western alliance the manpower and other resources to escalate conflicts against the Asian hegemons? And with the majority of the world’s population either in the Asian hegemons’ sphere of influence or determined to not join the western alliance  can the alliance succeed despite passive but mounting hostility from the rest of the world?· Will Russia get a gold-backed trade settlement currency approved in Kazan? If so  how will it be comprised? And what will be the consequences for the dollar-based fiat currency system?· What are likely to be the legal and financial consequences of the theft of interest from Russia’s Euroclear account?· What are Putin’s intentions over Ukraine  having put out renewed feelers for peace last week? And what was the peace conference in Zurich all about  from which Russia was excluded and China decided not to attend?· What actions are China likely to take against an increasingly aggressive America in the Pacific over Taiwan?The resolution of these issues is largely interdependent. This article flags up likely answers and gives its readers some guidance as to how these issues relate to each other. It would appear that their complexity works against the West which is proving incapable of sufficient strategic judgement  compared with that of the Russians and Chinese. It compares the blundering ability to think just one move ahead instead of a more considered and patient approach.The social backgroundIn any war  the likely victor needs to have a fighting ethic. The Spartans versus Greeks  the Roman legions  the Crusades. The alliance of Wellington’s army and Blucher’s Prussians against Napoleon at Waterloo. And in modern times  the toleration of slaughter in the trenches in the First World War followed by the Allies’ defeat of Germany and Japan in the second world war. Men wrenched from their working lives with the threat of death require a belief that what they are doing is for the nation or for God.These motivations do not exist in the west today. National identity is fatally fractured  wokeness has replaced the cohesive morality of Christianity  and there are no material rewards. But Russia is not a godless society  and the homeland is being threatened. And that is why President Putin has the national backing that western leaders lack.The rest of the world looks on  refusing to be drawn into conflicts initiated by dying empires. Nations are fence-sitting  many with large Muslim populations antagonised by America’s support for Israel over Gaza.These are the social truths behind the conflict between the United States with its NATO partners and the two Russian hegemons  Russia and China. Skirmishing in various theatres of war with special forces is one thing  but escalation requiring civilian boots on the ground is another. In this  Russia has proved herself capable of motivating her men  and China’s command of her citizens suggests the same. Instead  Sunak and other European leaders are talking of enforced enlistment — good luck with that.Warfare has also evolved from the battlefield tactics of yesteryear. In the West  we assumed that we can beat Russia through a combination of special forces (i.e. the brilliance of our SAS and Navy Seals) and technology. Both these are turning out to be the triumph of hope over experience. The west has failed to innovate her defence capability sufficiently and doesn’t possess the hypersonic missiles of the Asian axis. And China’s applied technology is now superior to anything we can muster.In short  as we drift into a seemingly inevitable third world war  these shortcomings will become increasingly obvious  and being built on sand NATO’s fragile unity will likely collapse.With the exceptions of the USSR and China  the post WW2 settlement saw the United States colonise the world. She has hundreds of military bases “protecting” her allies. Her currency has been the only settlement medium for commodities and international trade. America is determined to protect this privileged position. And it is through both the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation and the rapidly expanding BRICS networks that Russia and China are overturning America’s order.The importance of BRICS is generally not understood in the west  being a silent struggle for global supremacy. Nowhere is this more evident than in plans for the SCO and BRICS to do away with the dollar for settling trade. It is set to expand from the current ten members to considerably more  as nations gain the necessary confidence to turn against America’s hegemony. New BRICS members will be required to turn their backs not only on America  but to the dollar as well. A new trade settlement arrangement will be required for that objective to be achieved.The BRICS currency solutionIn the plans for a new BRICS currency  probably the most important adviser is Sergei Glazyev. He has Putin’s ear. The failure of his initial proposal to make the agenda in Johannesburg was probably a setback rather than the end of his project. But there is a larger geopolitical picture to consider.There can be little doubt that gold will be involved in some way. Not only did Glazyev write an article in the Moscow business magazine Vedomosti proposing that a proper gold standard should be reintroduced for Russia’s rouble  but the various briefings and leaks point to gold having a role in the new trade exchange medium. If Glazyev is any guide to Putin’s thinking  then gold will be the stabilising factor for Russia  BRICS  and the wider Shanghai Cooperation Organisation.The reintroduction of gold as the keystone to reserve currencies for all the nations involved is certain to have a major impact on the dollar  the euro  the yen  the pound  and any other fiat currency not in the scheme. Almost certainly  it will accelerate the collapse of the dollar  not just because the redemption of these currencies for gold  energy  and commodities generally will accelerate  but because international faith in the value of these currencies relative to the new will be undermined. This raises two issues: it will almost certainly lead to the destruction of trade with and between the old order western alliance  and it will also threaten the values of SCO and BRICS member nations’ currencies unless they are also credibly linked to gold’s value.On the first issue  neither China nor India is ready for such an aggressive step. It will destroy much of their existing trade  and in China’s case the central plank of her foreign policy is not to initiate aggressive economic action against her geopolitical enemies  preferring them to make the errors. China will therefore respond to events having already planned ahead for them.The second issue  being the threat to members’ own currencies from a properly functioning trade settlement medium  is likely to be Glazyev’s greatest challenge. Only a few of the members have sufficient gold to back their currencies  though many of them have already been selling their dollars for bullion. Assuming the wider currency issue is not overtaken by events  the only practical solution is to propose a framework at Kazan  the basis of which is already rumoured to consist of backing by gold and a mixture of participating currencies.One can imagine that many participants will not want to have their own currencies in the scheme for fear of losing control over them: the Saudis could fall in this camp. Glazyev’s plan is therefore likely to rely heavily on the yuan and rouble as new reserve currencies  but not in the front line like the dollar. Their trade weighted involvement would justify these ratings anyway and should be acceptable to the Kazan delegates.If these principal currencies are to have a role in a viable alternative to the dollar  then it is for them that gold backing becomes important. As Glazyev pointed out in his Vedomosti article there are substantial benefits for Russia to turn the rouble into a gold substitute anyway. While China will not want to take this initiative  except to protect the yuan in a dollar collapse  she could confirm her long-term intention to do so  and to give her statement credibility reallocate to her monetary reserves some of the bullion stocks she has been hoarding off-balance sheet in various government accounts.It would be an important step in the direction of displacing the dollar  but tactfully handled and presented as a future ambition will probably not be associated in western minds with a deliberate act of dollar destruction by China. Therefore  we should expect to see a BRICS agreement in Kazan for a new currency in principle  perhaps with a new committee appointed to come up with a concrete proposal for the following year’s summit when China will be chairman.Stealing from EuroclearAt the G7 summit in Italy  it was agreed that the interest on Russia’s currency and bond balances in Euroclear be redirected in support of Ukraine’s war effort. This interest is as much Russia’s property as the principal which was defaulted on by the US and her allies in the name of sanctions.There are far greater western-owned assets in Russia  which Putin might seize in retaliation. But as Jim Rickards  a lawyer qualified in these matters pointed out in a series of recent interviews  Russia could sue Euroclear wherever it has offices  including Hong Kong  Singapore  Dubai  and Beijing. This is where the structure of Euroclear might lead to its downfall.On shareholders’ equity of less than €10 billion  it acts as the settlement agent and depository for €37 trillion in bonds  equities  and derivatives. In order for Euroclear to remove risk of settlement failure  it owns these securities as its own property  issuing electronic certificates of entitlement in their place. This is what the dematerialisation of certificates means.The reasons for this arrangement need not detain us here  but a successful action by Russia under international law in any of the jurisdictions above might require Euroclear to cede some of its property beyond its shareholders’ interests. In other words  sell some of or borrow against the pool of securities it owns on behalf of you and me.It could be an attractive option for the Russian state to sue Euroclear in an attempt to undermine western capital markets. In effect  this would compromise the standing of Euroclear with respect to its obligations on all investments in its care. In any event  the G7’s cavalier treatment of another nation’s property will not go unnoticed in the global south.The war in UkraineDespite western propaganda to the contrary  it is clear that Russia is gaining the upper hand in the proxy war against America and her NATO partners. It has reached the stage where Russia has come up with another peace proposal  as a test of Zelensky’s backers’ resolve. At the same time  92 national delegations attended a peace summit in Switzerland  to which Russia was not invited. Joe Biden decided to not attend  preferring the easiness of a Hollywood fundraiser instead.Biden’s absence spoke volumes about how Ukraine is now seen to be a lost cause. Doubtless  that’s why Victoria Nuland who has led on US policy in Ukraine for a decade or more resigned in March. Biden’s problem now is how to defer a US defeat until after the presidential election in November. America is already ramping up an alternative conflict against China over Taiwan as an alternative theatre of war to Ukraine  but the Chinese are refusing to take the bait. But from Putin’s position  he has to decide whether by pushing for an early victory or by delaying  how it might influence the US presidential outcome.If he defeats Ukraine  which means at least capturing Kiev and driving out US and NATO forces  it will be a political failure for Biden  bookending his hasty retreat from Afghanistan in 2021. Trump’s chances of being re-elected should be enhanced. It is more likely that Trump will agree to a peace settlement  and the Deep State facing up to reality would probably take the opportunity to concede the policy failure  so long as Russia offers an acceptable fall-back solution.Alternatively  if Biden is re-elected it is more likely that aggressive anti-Russian US foreign policy will escalate. Therefore  the odds appear to favour a renewed Russian intensification of its military operation in the coming months. Perhaps it is this dawning reality driving European NATO members into a panic over the Russian threat  even talking of conscription to bolster their inadequate armies. But with their high levels of government debt as a starting point for most of these participants  it would become an economic suicide note  even without a social rebellion of their civilian populations.Therefore  it appears that not only has Putin the upper hand over Ukraine  but the timing of his end game is being determined by his reading of the US’s presidential election. Furthermore  with Ukraine running out of press-ganged volunteers  human resources and battlefield morale strongly favour an early push by the Russians.The gold backstopAs noted above  there is a strong case for putting the rouble onto a gold standard. But being in partnership with China  it is not a decision solely for Putin. A premature move is unlikely to have the support of the SCO and BRICS memberships. Nevertheless  if America’s mindless doubling down on its losing geopolitical bets continues  a move to undermine the dollar’s credibility by announcing a gold standard could be the only way to avoid escalation towards a nuclear conflict. The War Between The St... Wilson  Clyde N. Best Price: $8.95 Buy New $10.20 (as of 04:43 UTC - Details)It is too soon to make that assessment. But as NATO’s prospects in Ukraine continue to deteriorate and western markets increasingly realise that the dollar is being discarded by nations representing the majority of the world’s population  priced in gold the dollar is bound to depreciate. This is why central banks not in the western alliance’s camp are reducing their dollar exposure.Undermining the dollar even more  selling by foreigners is bound to drive up the cost of financing the US Government’s deficit. Rising bond yields will spread from New York to the rest of the world wherever there is a government committed to budget deficits. Financial asset values will decline  and economic slumps ensue. It is getting difficult to argue for a more positive outcome.Forward thinking Chinese and Russian leaders have been aware of this danger for some time  which is why they have been careful not to provoke it. Equally  they have insured against it by accumulating substantial gold reserves to secure their currency and credit values against a full-scale western currency and financial asset crisis.In default of alternatives  it now appears to China’s households  whose annual savings total the equivalent of $6 trillion  that gold has become an attractive investment option. As the crisis facing the western alliance develops  the pace at which these savings migrate from bank deposits into gold is set to increase. The quantities involved could easily trigger a crisis in gold and silver paper obligations  if bullion banks in London and New York fail to deliver physical bullion.As I stated earlier in this article  the resolution of geopolitical issues is interdependent  which makes it virtually impossible to judge the timing of an inevitable currency crisis for the West. The only forces trying to manage this risk appear to the Chinese and the Russians. Our politicians are unaware of the magnitude of these dangers. For those of us trying to protect our wealth in these uncertain times  it is time to batten down the hatches and get out of credit before its value is destroyed.Reprinted with permission from MacleodFinance Substack.The Best of Alasdair Macleod,neutral,0.0,0.99,0.0,mixed,0.04,0.21,0.75,True,English,"['The Unofficial WW3', 'dollar-based fiat currency system', 'gold-backed trade settlement currency', 'acute refugee problems', 'large Muslim populations', 'Asian hegemons’ sphere', 'sufficient strategic judgement', 'European NATO members', 'desperate western alliance', 'third world war', 'First World War', 'second world war', 'sufficient troops', 'strategic point', 'western leaders', 'disparate elements', 'hypersonic missiles', 'depleted armies', 'national service', 'collateral damage', 'countless Ukrainians', 'global dominance', 'European allies', 'Frances Stonor', 'Best Price', 'Johannesburg agenda', 'presidential election', 'modern politics', 'million souls', 'precipitative action', 'side bet', 'direct engagements', 'exhaustive list', 'following questions', 'other resources', 'Euroclear account', 'renewed feelers', 'likely answers', 'blundering ability', 'patient approach', 'social background', 'likely victor', 'fighting ethic', 'Roman legions', 'modern times', 'working lives', 'National identity', 'cohesive morality', 'material rewards', 'godless society', 'national backing', 'The Piper', 'The Spartans', 'G7 meeting', 'property rights', 'financial consequences', 'peace conference', 'President Putin', 'cohesive nations', 'aggressive America', 'The West', 'Allies’ defeat', 'number', 'resolution', 'battle', 'Russia', 'former', 'weapons', 'China', 'Europeans', 'Britain', 'Talk', 'recruitment', 'exaggeration', 'pressure', 'nuclear', 'wars', 'operations', 'Iraq', 'Libya', 'Syria', 'Afghanistan', 'regret', 'path', 'destruction', '04:43 UTC', 'Details', 'Italy', 'plans', 'interest', 'reserves', 'Ukraine', 'armaments', 'theft', 'contempt', 'year', 'chairmanship', 'BRICS', 'membership', 'Kazan', 'October', 'article', 'manhood', 'Biden', 'skin', 'November', 'callousness', 'Caesar', 'Gaul', 'glory', 'timing', 'view', 'Taiwan', 'conflicts', 'manpower', 'majority', 'influence', 'passive', 'hostility', 'legal', 'intentions', 'Zurich', 'actions', 'Pacific', 'issues', 'readers', 'guidance', 'complexity', 'Chinese', 'Greeks', 'Crusades', 'Wellington', 'army', 'Blucher', 'Napoleon', 'Waterloo', 'toleration', 'slaughter', 'trenches', 'Germany', 'Japan', 'threat', 'death', 'belief', 'motivations', 'wokeness', 'Christianity', 'homeland', 'empires']",2024-06-21,2024-06-22,lewrockwell.com

Recent financials show a strong uptick in sales to €12.83 billion and net income to €595 million in Q1 2024  reflecting a robust year-over-year growth. Strategic alliances and technological advancements  like the feasibility study for hydrogen infrastructure in Canadian airports and collaborations for high-speed communications systems  underscore its innovative edge and potential for future growth despite slower revenue growth projections (10.3% annually) compared to higher market expectations.ENXTPA:AIR Discounted Cash Flow as at Jun 2024Overview: Guerbet SA specializes in the development and marketing of contrast media products  delivery systems  medical devices  and related solutions with a market capitalization of approximately €454.06 million.Story continuesOperations: The company generates €795.65 million in revenue from the research  development  production  and sale of contrast media for medical imaging.Estimated Discount To Fair Value: 49.6%Guerbet  priced at €36.1  is markedly below its fair value of €71.57  suggesting undervaluation based on cash flow analysis.

Recent corporate actions include a dividend increase to €0.75 per share and an extension of its buyback plan  reflecting positive management sentiment. Despite challenges like a lower net profit margin this year at 35.2% compared to last year's 53.2%  Tikehau is poised for substantial earnings growth  forecasted significantly above the market average with expected annual growth rates around 31%.

AccorInvest owns and operates the operating companies of these hotels and has signed long-term management contracts with the Accor Group. The memorandum concerns the acquisition by Covivio Hotels of 24 hotel operating companies2 – allowing the consolidation of these hotels  which will be owned and operated by Covivio Hotels – in exchange for the transfer to AccorInvest of title to 10 other hotels property companies  which will then be owned and operated by AccorInvest.The agreed value of the property companies transferred to AccorInvest is €208 million3  while the value of the operating companies acquired by Covivio Hotels is €266 million4. Based on 2023 figures  the assets transferred to AccorInvest represent annual rental income of €11 million  while the operating companies acquired by Covivio Hotels generate EBITDA of around €31 million.The deal enables Covivio Hotels to acquire operating companies in major tourist areas with considerable potential for value creation through repositioning and management optimisation. Some of these hotels will continue to operate under Accor brands (under management or franchise agreements)  while others will be rebranded.The transaction marks the continuation of Covivio’s development in hotel real estate  towards a more diversified model (leased assets  operating properties).A further step is also underway for hotels held in joint venturesCovivio Hotels is also the indirect owner and asset manager of another 60 hotels leased to AccorInvest and held through two joint ventures created in 2010 and 2014 respectively: one 80% owned by Crédit Agricole Assurances and 20% by Covivio Hotels  and the other owned by Caisse des Dépôts et Consignations  Société Générale Assurances and Covivio Hotels.The memorandum provides for the acquisition by Covivio Hotels and its partners of 19 operating companies5 for the 2 joint ventures (thereby enabling them to be consolidated as properties owned and operated by Covivio Hotels and its partners) in exchange for the transfer to AccorInvest of six other hotel property companies  which will then be owned by AccorInvest.These consolidation transactions for Covivio Hotels and the joint ventures represent a total of €393 million6 for the hotel property companies sold by Covivio Hotels and its partners  equivalent to that of the operating companies owned and operated by the companies whose shares will be acquired. Upon completion  Covivio Hotels and its partners will have consolidated ownership of 43 hotels and AccorInvest 16.1 52.2% owned and controlled by Covivio.

We’re keen to talk to them further. We want to make sure that we can help them recover ” he told The Irish Times on Thursday in advance of a dinner promoting the Irish industry in London.“We’re open to any good suggestions that are reasonable. [But] they’ll all have to be taken into the context of the budget.”READ MORETwo of the biggest companies on the stock exchange in Dublin  building materials group CRH and betting company Flutter Entertainment  both exited recently while another heavyweight  packaging business Smurfit Kappa  is due to leave shortly. Only three new listings have happened in the past five years while the number of companies on the exchange has halved in the past 17 years.Mr Richmond said the challenges faced by the Irish exchange are not unique to the Republic and have affected smaller bourses across Europe  but the Government would continue to hold discussions with the industry to see what it could do to help.However  European state aid regulations could inhibit any attempt by the Government to bring in new tax laws designed to assist the Irish sector.Mr Richmond flew to London on Thursday to address a dinner hosted by Enterprise Ireland at the Irish embassy in Belgravia. The gathering was focused on the financial technology sector and attendees included Irish diaspora figures working in the industry in Britain and also IDA Ireland multinational client companies who invest in the sector globally.The Fine Gael TD  who took on the financial services portfolio 11 weeks ago after he was considered for a full Cabinet position by new Taoiseach Simon Harris  said the Government is targeting further growth across the industry.[ Irish stock exchange owner pushes for retail investor scheme like UK individual savings accounts ]The Minister also addressed comments about the financial services sector made this week to The Irish Times by Rachel Reeves  the UK Labour politician who is odds-on to be the first woman appointed chancellor of the exchequer if  as expected  Labour wins the UK’s election on July 4th.Ms Reeves confirmed that a Labour government would seek a better post-Brexit deal with the European Union for City of London financial workers  including more recognition of qualifications. She acknowledged there would have to be “give and take” in any fresh post-Brexit negotiations with the EU  although she did not get into specifics about what a Labour government might offer to Europe in return.Mr Richmond said the Government wants Britain to have “a closer relationship” with the EU but he warned it could not expect a “free pass” to get whatever it wanted. The EU has also repeatedly warned that Britain will not be allowed “cherry pick” what it wants from EU membership.“At EU level  Ireland will always push to keep the door open for more discussions ” said Mr Richmond. “We’ve always said we want to be the UK’s best friend in the European Union. Not just when it comes to financial services  but more generally.”The Irish financial services sector  which employs 57 000 workers  is closely linked to the sector in the City of London  as many big UK banks and insurers have back-office operations in Dublin.,neutral,0.04,0.84,0.12,positive,0.74,0.25,0.01,True,English,"['Dublin stock exchange', 'big hitters', 'Government', 'incentives', 'loss', 'IDA Ireland multinational client companies', 'The Fine Gael TD', 'new Taoiseach Simon Harris', 'The Irish financial services sector', 'many big UK banks', 'UK individual savings accounts', 'European state aid regulations', 'Irish stock exchange owner', 'tax-efficient savings products', 'The Irish Times', 'several high-profile exits', 'building materials group', 'three new listings', 'financial services portfolio', 'full Cabinet position', 'Irish diaspora figures', 'new tax laws', 'financial technology sector', 'fresh post-Brexit negotiations', 'past five years', 'UK Labour politician', 'retail investor scheme', 'London financial workers', 'Irish sector', 'new flotations', 'The EU', 'past 17 years', 'Irish stocks', 'Irish exchange', 'Irish embassy', 'biggest companies', 'Enterprise Ireland', 'European Union', 'tax incentives', 'retail investment', 'post-Brexit deal', 'recent years', 'Irish industry', 'Neale Richmond', 'Mr Richmond', 'clear merits', 'good suggestions', 'betting company', 'Flutter Entertainment', 'packaging business', 'Smurfit Kappa', 'smaller bourses', 'Rachel Reeves', 'first woman', 'July 4th', 'Ms Reeves', 'closer relationship', 'free pass', 'best friend', 'back-office operations', 'EU membership', 'EU level', 'Labour government', 'Euronext Dublin', '57,000 workers', 'paucity', 'activity', 'Minister', 'responsibility', 'talks', 'proposal', 'Thursday', 'advance', 'dinner', 'context', 'budget', 'READ', 'CRH', 'number', 'challenges', 'Republic', 'discussions', 'attempt', 'Belgravia', 'gathering', 'attendees', 'Britain', 'growth', 'comments', 'chancellor', 'exchequer', 'election', 'recognition', 'qualifications', 'specifics', 'return', 'cherry', 'door', 'insurers']",2024-06-21,2024-06-22,irishtimes.com

Sanofi will present new data from its hemophilia portfolio at the 32nd Congress of the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH)  taking place June 22-26  2024  in Bangkok  Thailand. Notable presentations on ALTUVIIIO [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant)  Fc-VWF-XTEN Fusion Protein] include long-term interim phase 3 data on the efficacy and safety of the treatment in adults and children with severe hemophilia A. Abstracts on fitusiran include information on surgical experience as well as long-term safety data from the ATLAS phase 3 clinical development program in adults and adolescents with hemophilia A or B  regardless of inhibitor status.Dietmar BergerChief Medical Officer  Global Head of Development“Our presence at this year’s congress demonstrates our continued commitment to delivering innovative first- and best-in-class solutions to the hemophilia community. Hemophilia is a lifelong condition that significantly impacts people living with the disease—from risk of bleeds and poor joint health to increased risks during surgery. These data reinforce why it’s critical to have treatment options  like ALTUVIIIO and fitusiran  that deliver effective outcomes in multiple scenarios and that can be used throughout a person’s life. We look forward to working in partnership with regulatory agencies to keep bringing novel options to those living with hemophilia.”ALTUVIIIOInterim analyses of XTEND-ed  a long-term extension phase 3 study  showed that in adult and pediatric populations  the use of ALTUVIIIO continued to provide highly effective bleed prevention leading to improvement or maintenance of joint health over a two-year period  and a safety profile consistent with that reported in the initial studies. The following abstracts will be presented at the meeting:“First Interim Analysis of Clinical Outcomes in Adults and Adolescents With Severe Hemophilia A Receiving Efanesoctocog Alfa Prophylaxis in XTEND-ed  a Phase 3 Long-term Extension Study” : In previously treated patients (≥12 years old) who had the completed the XTEND-1 (Arm A/B) trial  the mean annualized bleed rate (ABR) with ALTUVIIIO was 0.72 (standard deviation [SD])=1.26) for arm A and 0.42 (SD=0.89) for arm B. No factor VIII inhibitors were detected (abstract OC50.1).: In previously treated patients (≥12 years old) who had the completed the XTEND-1 (Arm A/B) trial  the mean annualized bleed rate (ABR) with ALTUVIIIO was 0.72 (standard deviation [SD])=1.26) for arm A and 0.42 (SD=0.89) for arm B. No factor VIII inhibitors were detected (abstract OC50.1). “Interim Analysis of Joint Outcomes in Adult and Adolescent Patients with Severe Hemophilia A Receiving Efanesoctocog Alfa During the Phase 3 XTEND-ed Long-Term Extension Study” : In patients who continued to receive once weekly ALTUVIIIO (50 IU/kg) in XTEND-ed  joint health had improved or been maintained in adults and adolescents over a two-year period  as measured by Hemophilia Joint Health Score total score  total joint score  and subdomain scores (abstract OC01.4).: In patients who continued to receive once weekly ALTUVIIIO (50 IU/kg) in XTEND-ed  joint health had improved or been maintained in adults and adolescents over a two-year period  as measured by Hemophilia Joint Health Score total score  total joint score  and subdomain scores (abstract OC01.4). “Long-term Outcomes With Efanesoctocog Alfa Prophylaxis for Previously Treated Children With Severe Hemophilia A  an Interim Analysis of the Phase 3 XTEND-ed Study"": No factor VIII inhibitors were detected. The mean ABR was 0.70 (SD=1.27)  a rate similar to the mean ABR observed in XTEND-Kids (abstract OC50.2).Additional data being presented at ISTH show that across clinical studies  ALTUVIIIO demonstrated effective bleed protection when used for perioperative management in participants with severe hemophilia A:“Perioperative Management with Efanesoctocog Alfa in Adults  Adolescents  and Children with Severe Hemophilia A in the Phase 3 XTEND Clinical Program”: In 41 patients from the XTEND-1  XTEND-Kids  and XTEND-ed studies who underwent 49 major surgeries  hemostasis was maintained in all surgeries and hemostatic response with ALTUVIIIO was rated as excellent in most surgeries (43/49) (abstract OC14.1).FitusiranAdditional analyses will be presented at ISTH that support the potential of fitusiran as a first-in-class treatment offering consistent bleed protection for patients with hemophilia A or B  regardless of inhibitor status.Novel results on the perioperative management of hemophilia using fitusiran prophylaxis in the ATLAS clinical development program demonstrated that major surgeries can be safely performed in patients on fitusiran:“Surgical experience in people with hemophilia A or B with and without inhibitors receiving fitusiran”: 60 major surgeries  including 24 in people with hemophilia with inhibitors  were conducted in the fitusiran clinical development program at the time of this analysis. Major surgeries were safely and effectively conducted with fitusiran prophylaxis following bleed management guidelines  irrespective of the patient’s inhibitor status (abstract OC14.2).Additional data presented at ISTH support the favorable safety profile for fitusiran and demonstrate that fitusiran prophylaxis under an antithrombin-based dosing regimen (AT-DR) successfully mitigated the risk of thrombotic events (TEs) and reduced the incidence of elevated liver enzymes and gallbladder inflammation or gallstones.The following abstracts will be presented at ISTH:“Incidence of thrombotic events in the fitusiran clinical development program” : Fitusiran prophylaxis under an AT-DR led to a marked reduction in TEs with substantially greater exposure on the AT-DR (abstract OC40.2).: Fitusiran prophylaxis under an AT-DR led to a marked reduction in TEs with substantially greater exposure on the AT-DR (abstract OC40.2). “Hepatobiliary events in the fitusiran clinical development program with the revised AT-based dose regimen”: Fitusiran prophylaxis under an AT-DR led to reductions in liver transaminase elevations and cholecystitis/cholelithiasis events. Liver transaminase elevations were infrequent and transient  and events of cholecystitis/cholelithiasis resolved without clinical complications with no fitusiran dose interruptions or discontinuations (abstract OC40.3).These presentations reinforce pivotal data that were presented earlier this year from the phase 3 open-label extension study (ATLAS-OLE) of fitusiran prophylaxis showing that maintaining AT activity levels between 15-35% resulted in clinically meaningful bleed control and a substantially improved benefit risk profile in people with hemophilia A or B  with or without inhibitors.Regulatory submissions for fitusiran for the treatment of hemophilia A or B in adults and adolescents with or without inhibitors have been completed in China  Brazil and the US with a US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) target action date of March 28  2025. The FDA also granted fitusiran Breakthrough Therapy Designation for hemophilia B with inhibitors in December 2023.About ALTUVIIIOALTUVIIIO [Antihemophilic Factor (Recombinant)  Fc-VWF-XTEN Fusion Protein] is a first-in-class high-sustained factor VIII therapy that is designed to extend protection from bleeds with once-weekly prophylactic dosing for adults and children with hemophilia A. In adults and adolescents  ALTUVIIIO has a 3- to 4-fold longer half-life relative to standard and extended half-life factor VIII products  providing high-sustained factor activity levels within normal to near-normal range  allowing for once-weekly administration. ALTUVIIIO is the first factor VIII therapy that has been shown to break through the von Willebrand factor ceiling  which imposes a half-life limitation on other factor VIII therapies. ALTUVIIIO builds on the innovative Fc fusion technology by adding a region of von Willebrand factor and XTEN polypeptides to extend its time in circulation.ALTUVIIIO is currently approved and marketed in the US  Taiwan  and Japan. On June 17  2024  it was approved by the European Commission for the treatment and prevention of bleeds and perioperative prophylaxis in hemophilia A under the name Altuvoct.ALTUVIIIO is the first factor VIII therapy to receive Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the FDA in May 2022  Fast Track Designation in February 2021  and Orphan Drug Designation in 2017. The European Commission granted Orphan designation in June 2019.About the XTEND-ed studyXTEND-ed (NCT04644575) is a phase 3 multicenter  open-label three-arm study of the long-term efficacy and safety of once-weekly ALTUVIIIO (50 IU/kg) in previously treated patients with severe hemophilia A. The study enrolled participants with severe hemophilia A from previous phase 3 studies  including adult and adolescent patients (≥12 years old) who completed the XTEND-1 study (NCT04161495) and children (<12 years old) who completed the XTEND-Kids study (NCT04759131) (arm A)  newly initiated patients (arm B  China only)  and newly initiated patients with planned major surgery (arm C). Participants received ALTUVIIIO prophylaxis for a total of 100 exposure days  cumulative from the initial study (52 weeks) and this study.About the Sanofi and Sobi collaborationSobi and Sanofi collaborate on the development and commercialization of Alprolix and Elocta/Eloctate.

Fitusiran is a potential first-in-class  antithrombin-lowering therapy for the prophylactic treatment of people with hemophilia A or B  with or without inhibitors. It is an investigational small volume  subcutaneously administered small interference RNA (siRNA) therapeutic that aims to prevent bleeds and rebalance hemostasis by lowering antithrombin  a protein that inhibits blood clotting  to promote thrombin generation. Fitusiran utilizes Alnylam Pharmaceutical Inc.’s ESC-GalNAc conjugate technology  which enables subcutaneous dosing with increased potency and durability. Fitusiran has the potential to enable prophylaxis for people around the world living with hemophilia A or B with or without inhibitors by virtue of its low overall treatment burden  with as few as six small-volume subcutaneous injections per year that do not require refrigeration.About the ATLAS clinical development programThe efficacy and safety of fitusiran are being investigated in the ATLAS clinical development program. The program includes the completed phase 3 studies ATLAS-INH (NCT03417102)  ATLAS-A/B (NCT03417245)  or ATLAS-PPX (NCT03549871) and the ongoing ATLAS-OLE (NCT03754790) study  a single-arm  phase 3  open-label study evaluating the safety and efficacy of fitusiran with a revised AT-DR  which was designed to maintain an antithrombin target range of 15%-35%. This study includes lower doses and less-frequent dosing than earlier studies. ATLAS-NEO (NCT05662319) is an additional phase 3 study currently recruiting participants to assess the frequency of treated bleeding episodes with fitusiran under the AT-DR in male adult and adolescent (≥12 years old) participants with hemophilia A or B  with or without inhibitory antibodies to factor VIII or IX  who have switched from their prior standard-of-care treatment.About SanofiWe are an innovative global healthcare company  driven by one purpose: we chase the miracles of science to improve people’s lives.

VYVGART Hytrulo is approved for CIDP as a once weekly 30-to-90 second subcutaneous injection. It is the first and only neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) blocker approved for the treatment of CIDP.“argenx continues to pursue our ambition to turn science into solutions for patients with severe autoimmunity ” said Luc Truyen M.D.  Ph.D.  Chief Medical Officer  argenx. “Patients have been waiting  and today argenx is delivering the first innovative treatment for CIDP in more than 30 years. VYVGART Hytrulo is a precision tool that has been shown to drive meaningful benefits for patients. Today’s FDA approval means that CIDP patients have a transformational new treatment option and further affirms the therapeutic profile of VYVGART Hytrulo and the potential of FcRn blockade in IgG-mediated autoimmune diseases.”CIDP is a rare  debilitating  often progressive  immune-mediated neuromuscular disorder of the peripheral nervous system. Patients experience a range of disabling mobility and sensory issues  including trouble standing from a seated position  pain and fatigue  and frequent tripping or falling. Many patients become wheelchair bound and are unable to work as the disease progresses. Currently  85% of patients require ongoing treatment and nearly 88% of treated patients experience residual impairment and disability.“While CIDP patients face many daily concerns and challenges  fear of disease progression should not be one of them. CIDP can be debilitating and have significant impact on quality of life and many patients with CIDP require treatments that may be burdensome. The approval of this promising new treatment option for CIDP may provide hope to patients that they can treat their disease beyond just managing symptoms. CIDP patients deserve treatment options and we look forward to a future of choices for optimal and individualized care ” said Lisa Butler  Executive Director  GBS|CIDP Foundation.“Today marks a groundbreaking day for the treatment of CIDP. Existing treatments have been limited to corticosteroids and plasma-derived therapies. These treatments  while effective for many patients  can be challenging for some patients to receive ” said Jeffrey Allen  M.D.  Professor  Department of Neurology  University of Minnesota and Principal Investigator in the ADHERE trial. “Today’s approval of VYVGART Hytrulo gives doctors and patients a new  safe and effective treatment option that may lessen the burden of treatment that some patients experience.”The FDA approval is based on the ADHERE Study  the largest clinical trial to date studying CIDP. In the ADHERE study  69% (221/322) of patients treated with VYVGART Hytrulo  regardless of prior treatment  demonstrated evidence of clinical improvement  including improvements in mobility  function and strength. ADHERE met its primary endpoint (p<0.0001) demonstrating a 61% reduction (HR: 0.39 95% CI: 0.25; 0.61) in the risk of relapse versus placebo. Ninety-nine percent of trial participants elected to participate in the ADHERE open-label extension. The safety results were generally consistent with the known safety profile of VYVGART in previous clinical studies and real-world use.VYVGART Hytrulo is also approved in the U.S. for the treatment of generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) in adult patients who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive.Access to VYVGART Hytruloargenx is committed to supporting access for patients to its medicines and VYVGART Hytrulo is expected to be available for patients in the U.S. immediately. The typical patient will have an annual out-of-pocket cost similar to that of a VYVGART or VYVGART Hytrulo patient with gMG  or an IVIg patient with CIDP.argenx has established a patient support program  My VYVGART Path  which can help patients and HCPs navigate access. My VYVGART Path program resources include disease and product education  access support and benefits verification  and financial assistance programs for eligible patients.

ADHERE enrolled 322 adult patients with CIDP who were treatment naïve (not on active treatment within the past six months or newly diagnosed) or being treated with immunoglobulin therapy or corticosteroids. The trial consisted of an open-label Stage A followed by a randomized  placebo-controlled Stage B. In order to be eligible for the trial  the diagnosis of CIDP was confirmed by an independent panel of experts. Patients entered a run-in stage  where any ongoing CIDP treatment was stopped and in order to be eligible for Stage A had to demonstrate active disease  with clinically meaningful worsening on at least one CIDP clinical assessment tool  including INCAT  I-RODS  or mean grip strength. Treatment naïve patients were able to skip the run-in period with proof of recent worsening. To advance to Stage B  patients needed to demonstrate evidence of clinical improvement (ECI) with VYVGART Hytrulo. ECI was achieved through improvement of the INCAT score  or improvement on I-RODS or mean grip strength if those scales had demonstrated worsening during the run-in period. In Stage B  patients were randomized to either VYVGART Hytrulo or placebo for up to 48 weeks. The primary endpoint was measured once 88 total relapses or events were achieved in Stage B and was based on the hazard ratio for the time to first adjusted INCAT deterioration (i.e. relapse). After Stage B  all patients had the option to roll-over to an open-label extension study to receive VYVGART Hytrulo.About VYVGART Hytrulo (efgartigimod alfa and hyaluronidase-qvfc)VYVGART Hytrulo is a subcutaneous combination of efgartigimod alfa  a human IgG1 antibody fragment marketed for intravenous use as VYVGART  and recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20)  Halozyme’s ENHANZE® drug delivery technology to facilitate subcutaneous injection delivery of biologics. In binding to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)  VYVGART Hytrulo results in the reduction of circulating IgG. It is the first-and-only approved FcRn blocker administered by subcutaneous injection.VYVGART Hytrulo is the proprietary name in the U.S. for subcutaneous efgartigimod alfa and recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20. It may be marketed under different proprietary names following approval in other regions.About Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating PolyneuropathyChronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) is a rare and serious autoimmune disease of the peripheral nervous system. Although confirmation of disease pathophysiology is still emerging  there is increasing evidence that IgG antibodies play a key role in the damage to the peripheral nerves. People with CIDP experience fatigue  muscle weakness and a loss of feeling in their arms and legs that can get worse over time or may come and go. These symptoms can significantly impair a person’s ability to function in their daily lives. Without treatment  one-third of people living with CIDP will need a wheelchair. There are approximately 24 000 patients in the U.S. currently receiving treatment for CIDP.About argenxargenx is a global immunology company committed to improving the lives of people suffering from severe autoimmune diseases.

VYVGART Hytrulo is approved for CIDP as a once weekly 30-to-90 second subcutaneous injection. It is the first and only neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) blocker approved for the treatment of CIDP.“argenx continues to pursue our ambition to turn science into solutions for patients with severe autoimmunity ” said Luc Truyen M.D.  Ph.D.  Chief Medical Officer  argenx. “Patients have been waiting  and today argenx is delivering the first innovative treatment for CIDP in more than 30 years. VYVGART Hytrulo is a precision tool that has been shown to drive meaningful benefits for patients. Today’s FDA approval means that CIDP patients have a transformational new treatment option and further affirms the therapeutic profile of VYVGART Hytrulo and the potential of FcRn blockade in IgG-mediated autoimmune diseases.”CIDP is a rare  debilitating  often progressive  immune-mediated neuromuscular disorder of the peripheral nervous system. Patients experience a range of disabling mobility and sensory issues  including trouble standing from a seated position  pain and fatigue  and frequent tripping or falling. Many patients become wheelchair bound and are unable to work as the disease progresses. Currently  85% of patients require ongoing treatment and nearly 88% of treated patients experience residual impairment and disability.“While CIDP patients face many daily concerns and challenges  fear of disease progression should not be one of them. CIDP can be debilitating and have significant impact on quality of life and many patients with CIDP require treatments that may be burdensome. The approval of this promising new treatment option for CIDP may provide hope to patients that they can treat their disease beyond just managing symptoms. CIDP patients deserve treatment options and we look forward to a future of choices for optimal and individualized care ” said Lisa Butler  Executive Director  GBS|CIDP Foundation.“Today marks a groundbreaking day for the treatment of CIDP. Existing treatments have been limited to corticosteroids and plasma-derived therapies. These treatments  while effective for many patients  can be challenging for some patients to receive ” said Jeffrey Allen  M.D.  Professor  Department of Neurology  University of Minnesota and Principal Investigator in the ADHERE trial. “Today’s approval of VYVGART Hytrulo gives doctors and patients a new  safe and effective treatment option that may lessen the burden of treatment that some patients experience.”The FDA approval is based on the ADHERE Study  the largest clinical trial to date studying CIDP. In the ADHERE study  69% (221/322) of patients treated with VYVGART Hytrulo  regardless of prior treatment  demonstrated evidence of clinical improvement  including improvements in mobility  function and strength. ADHERE met its primary endpoint (p<0.0001) demonstrating a 61% reduction (HR: 0.39 95% CI: 0.25; 0.61) in the risk of relapse versus placebo. Ninety-nine percent of trial participants elected to participate in the ADHERE open-label extension. The safety results were generally consistent with the known safety profile of VYVGART in previous clinical studies and real-world use.VYVGART Hytrulo is also approved in the U.S. for the treatment of generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) in adult patients who are anti-acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibody positive.Access to VYVGART Hytruloargenx is committed to supporting access for patients to its medicines and VYVGART Hytrulo is expected to be available for patients in the U.S. immediately. The typical patient will have an annual out-of-pocket cost similar to that of a VYVGART or VYVGART Hytrulo patient with gMG  or an IVIg patient with CIDP.argenx has established a patient support program  My VYVGART Path  which can help patients and HCPs navigate access. My VYVGART Path program resources include disease and product education  access support and benefits verification  and financial assistance programs for eligible patients. More information is available at VYVGART.com.Conference Call Detailsargenx will host a conference call Friday  June 21  2024  at 11:00 pm CET (5:00pm ET) to discuss the approval.

ADHERE enrolled 322 adult patients with CIDP who were treatment naïve (not on active treatment within the past six months or newly diagnosed) or being treated with immunoglobulin therapy or corticosteroids. The trial consisted of an open-label Stage A followed by a randomized  placebo-controlled Stage B. In order to be eligible for the trial  the diagnosis of CIDP was confirmed by an independent panel of experts. Patients entered a run-in stage  where any ongoing CIDP treatment was stopped and in order to be eligible for Stage A had to demonstrate active disease  with clinically meaningful worsening on at least one CIDP clinical assessment tool  including INCAT  I-RODS  or mean grip strength. Treatment naïve patients were able to skip the run-in period with proof of recent worsening. To advance to Stage B  patients needed to demonstrate evidence of clinical improvement (ECI) with VYVGART Hytrulo. ECI was achieved through improvement of the INCAT score  or improvement on I-RODS or mean grip strength if those scales had demonstrated worsening during the run-in period. In Stage B  patients were randomized to either VYVGART Hytrulo or placebo for up to 48 weeks. The primary endpoint was measured once 88 total relapses or events were achieved in Stage B and was based on the hazard ratio for the time to first adjusted INCAT deterioration (i.e. relapse). After Stage B  all patients had the option to roll-over to an open-label extension study to receive VYVGART Hytrulo.About VYVGART Hytrulo (efgartigimod alfa and hyaluronidase-qvfc)VYVGART Hytrulo is a subcutaneous combination of efgartigimod alfa  a human IgG1 antibody fragment marketed for intravenous use as VYVGART  and recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20)  Halozyme’s ENHANZE® drug delivery technology to facilitate subcutaneous injection delivery of biologics. In binding to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)  VYVGART Hytrulo results in the reduction of circulating IgG. It is the first-and-only approved FcRn blocker administered by subcutaneous injection.VYVGART Hytrulo is the proprietary name in the U.S. for subcutaneous efgartigimod alfa and recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20. It may be marketed under different proprietary names following approval in other regions.About Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating PolyneuropathyChronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) is a rare and serious autoimmune disease of the peripheral nervous system. Although confirmation of disease pathophysiology is still emerging  there is increasing evidence that IgG antibodies play a key role in the damage to the peripheral nerves. People with CIDP experience fatigue  muscle weakness and a loss of feeling in their arms and legs that can get worse over time or may come and go. These symptoms can significantly impair a person’s ability to function in their daily lives. Without treatment  one-third of people living with CIDP will need a wheelchair. There are approximately 24 000 patients in the U.S. currently receiving treatment for CIDP.About argenxargenx is a global immunology company committed to improving the lives of people suffering from severe autoimmune diseases. Partnering with leading academic researchers through its Immunology Innovation Program (IIP)  argenx aims to translate immunology breakthroughs into a world-class portfolio of novel antibody-based medicines. argenx developed and is commercializing the first approved neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) blocker in the U.S.  Japan  Israel  the EU  the UK  Canada and China.
