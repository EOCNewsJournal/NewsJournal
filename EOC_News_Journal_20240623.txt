43122,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rt.com/business/599745-belgium-warns-seizing-russian-assets/,EU state warns against seizing Russian money,The Belgian finance minister has warned that the security of Russian frozen assets would have financial and legal consequences Read Full Article at RT.com,Confiscating Moscow’s assets runs unpredictable legal and financial risks  according to Belgium’s finance ministerBelgium does not support the seizure of Russian assets that have been frozen by the EU as part of Ukraine-related sanctions  the country’s Finance Minister Vincent Van Peteghem said on Friday  highlighting the mounting risks related to the move.The West froze nearly $300 billion in assets belonging to the Central Bank of Russia following the launch of Moscow’s military campaign against Ukraine in February 2022  a move denounced by Moscow as “theft.” Around $280 billion of this sum is held in the EU  primarily in the Belgium-based depositary and clearing house Euroclear.“First of all  for our country there are two elements that are important: we did not touch the assets themselves  as the ownership title change would yield consequences both on the legal side and financial side that are unknown ” Van Peteghem said during a press conference after the bloc’s ECOFIN meeting in Luxembourg.“And second  of course  risk sharing  that I think is important in the rollout of the instruments and is a crucial element of all discussion ” the minister added.Earlier this month  the G7 nations announced that they had reached an agreement on using interest from frozen Russian assets to finance a $50 billion loan to help Kiev buy weapons and rebuild damaged infrastructure. At the time  Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said that the confiscation of the assets was not on the table.In April  Van Peteghem stated that the bloc was close to reaching a political agreement on seizing the profits generated by Russia’s central bank reserves  stressing that the first tax collection could take place as early as July 1.The idea of seizing the frozen Russian assets has been debated by EU lawmakers and the bloc’s allies for about two years. While the US and UK have called for the outright confiscation of the funds  multiple reports suggest that EU member states remain cautious regarding the move  citing the lack of a legal basis for such a measure as well as fears that Russia will take retaliatory steps. Some top officials have reportedly warned that the drastic move could undermine investors’ confidence in the EU’s financial system.The Kremlin has denounced the push to use its immobilized funds to provide support for Ukraine. Earlier this week  Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said that Moscow has a “wide arsenal” of political and economic countermeasures it can use to respond to the potential confiscation of its sovereign assets.,negative,0.0,0.26,0.74,negative,0.0,0.24,0.75,True,English,"['EU state', 'Russian money', 'Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Maria Zakharova', 'Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni', 'Finance Minister Vincent Van Peteghem', 'first tax collection', 'central bank reserves', 'EU member states', 'frozen Russian assets', 'unpredictable legal', 'financial risks', 'Ukraine-related sanctions', 'mounting risks', 'The West', 'military campaign', 'Belgium-based depositary', 'clearing house', 'two elements', 'title change', 'legal side', 'financial side', 'press conference', 'ECOFIN meeting', 'risk sharing', 'crucial element', 'G7 nations', '$50 billion loan', 'damaged infrastructure', 'two years', 'multiple reports', 'legal basis', 'retaliatory steps', 'top officials', 'investors’ confidence', 'financial system', 'The Kremlin', 'wide arsenal', 'economic countermeasures', 'outright confiscation', 'potential confiscation', 'sovereign assets', 'EU lawmakers', 'immobilized funds', 'drastic move', 'political agreement', 'Moscow', 'seizure', 'part', 'country', 'Friday', 'launch', 'February', 'sum', 'Euroclear', 'ownership', 'consequences', 'bloc', 'Luxembourg', 'course', 'rollout', 'instruments', 'discussion', 'interest', 'Kiev', 'weapons', 'time', 'April', 'profits', 'place', 'July', 'idea', 'allies', 'lack', 'fears', 'push', 'support']",2024-06-22,2024-06-23,rt.com

He didn’t even have to show up.None of the Big Players did. Or in case they sent their emissaries  there was significant refusal to sign the vacuous final declaration – as in BRICS members Brazil  India  Saudi Arabia  UAE and South Africa.Without BRICS  there’s absolutely nothing the collective West – as in The Hegemon and assorted vassals – can do to alter the proxy war chessboard in Ukraine. Raging Twenties: Great... Escobar  Pepe Best Price: $22.73 Buy New $20.20 (as of 03:32 UTC - Details)In his carefully calibrated speech to diplomats and the leadership of Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs  Putin delineated an incredibly restrained and strategic approach to solve the Ukraine problem. In the context of the Hegemon’s escalatory green light – actually in practice for several months now – for Kiev to attack deeper into the Russian Federation  Putin’s offer was extremely generous.That is a direct offer to the Hegemon and the collective West – as the sweaty T-shirt actor in Kiev  apart from illegitimate  is beyond irrelevant.Predictably  NATO – via that epileptic slab of Norwegian wood – already proclaimed its refusal to negotiate  even as some relatively awake members of the Verkhovna Rada (Ukraine’s parliament) started discussing the offer  according to Duma Chairman Vyacheslav Volodin.Moscow sees the Verkhovna Rada as the only legitimate entity in Ukraine – and the only one with which would be possible to reach an agreement.Russian UN representative Vasily Nebenzya cut to the chase – diplomatically: if the generous proposal is refused  next time conditions for starting negotiations will be “different”. And “far more unfavorable”  according to Duma Defense Committee head Andrei Kartapolov.As Nebenzya stressed that in case of a refusal the collective West will bear full responsibility for further bloodshed  Kartapolov elaborated on the Big Picture: Russia’s real target is to create a whole new security system for the Eurasian space.And that  of course  is anathema to the Hegemon’s elites.Putin’s security vision for Eurasia harks back to this legendary speech at the Munich Security Conference in 2007. Now  with the steady advance of an irreversible multi-nodal (italics mine) and multi-centric new system of international relations  the Kremlin is pressing for an urgent solution – considering the extremely dangerous escalation of these past few months.Putin once again had to remind the deaf  dumb and blind of the obvious:“Calls to inflict a strategic defeat on Russia  which has the largest arsenal of nuclear weapons  demonstrate the extreme adventurism of Western politicians. They either do not understand the scale of the threat they themselves create  or they are simply obsessed with the belief in their own immunity and their own exclusivity. Both can turn into a tragedy”.They remain deaf  dumb and blind.A proposal that does not solve anything?A fiery debate is raging in informed circles in Russia about Putin’s proposal. Critics blast it as a capitulation – forced by selected oligarchs and influential business circles  adverse to an “almost war” (the preferred motto) that keeps postponing the inevitable decapitation strike.Critics argue that the military strategy is totally subordinated to a political strategy. And that would explain the serious problems in the Black Sea and in Transnistria: the political center of power refuses to conquer the number one economic/military target  which is Odessa.Additionally  Ukraine’s weapon supply chains are not being properly interrupted.The key critical point is “this is taking too long”. One just needs to look at the example of Mariupol.In 2014  Mariupol was left in the control of nazi-banderista gangs as part of a financial deal with Rinat Akhmetov  the owner of the Azovstal works. That’s a classic case of oligarchs and financiers prevailing over military objectives.Putin’s generosity  visible in this latest peace offer  also elicits a parallel with what happened in Dara’a in Syria: Russia also negotiated what looked at first like a peace deal. Yet Dara’a remains a mess  extremely violent  with Syrian and Russian soldiers at risk.It gets really tricky when the current proposal only asks NATO not to be encroached in Kiev; but at the same time Kiev will be allowed to have an army  based on the (aborted) April 2022 negotiations in Istanbul.Critics also argue that Putin seems to believe that this proposal will solve the war. Not really. A real de-nazification campaign is an affair of decades – involving everything from full demilitarization to eradicating focuses of extremist ideology. A real cultural revolution.The current escalation already is in tune with the orders given by the rarefied plutocracy who really runs the show to messengers – and operatives: nazi-banderista gangs will unleash a War of Terror inside Russia for years. From Ukraine territory. Just like Idlib in Syria remains a terror-friendly environment.The Odessa filePutin’s strategy may be on to something that escapes his critics. His wish for a return of peace and the re-establishment of sound relations with Kiev and the West has got to be a ruse – as he’s the first to know that’s not gonna happen.It’s clear that Kiev will not willingly cede territory: these will have to be conquered in the battlefield. Moreover NATO simply cannot sign its cosmic humiliation on the dotted line  accepting that Russia will get what it is demanding since February 2022.Putin’s first – diplomatic – objective though has already been met. He has clearly demonstrated to the Global Majority he’s open to solve the dilemma in a serene atmosphere  while discombobulated NATO keeps shrieking “War!” every other minute.The Hegemon wants war? So war it will be – to the last Ukrainian.And that brings us to the Odessa file.Putin  crucially  did not say anything about Odessa. This is Kiev’s last chance saloon to keep Odessa. If the peace proposal is rejected for good  Odessa will feature in the next list of non-negotiables.Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov  once again  nailed it: “Putin is patient. Those with ears will hear  those with brains will understand”.No one should expect working brains popping up across the West. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has confirmed how NATO is planning massive installations in Poland  Romania and Slovakia to “coordinate transfer of weapons to Ukraine”.Add to it the epileptic slab of Norwegian wood stating that NATO is “discussing” bringing their nuclear weapons to a state of combat readiness “in the face of the growing threat from Russia and China”.Once again Old Stolty gives away the game: note this is all about the Hegemon’s paranoia with the top two “existential threats”  theRussia-China strategic partnership. That is  the leaders of BRICS coordinating the drive towards a multipolar  multi-nodal (italics mine)  “harmonic” (Putin’s terminology) world.Stealing Russian money is legalThen there’s the blatant theft of Russian financial assets.At their sorry spectacle in Puglia  in southern Italy  the G7 – in the presence of the illegitimate sweaty T-shirt actor – agreed to shove an extra $50 billion in loans to Ukraine  funded by the interest on Russia’s frozen and for all practical purposes stolen assets.With impeccably twisted logic  Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni – whose hairdressing and wardrobe revamp conclusively did not apply to her brains – said that the G7 “will not confiscate frozen assets of the Russian Federation”; “we are talking about the interest that they accumulate over time.”As financial scams go  this one is a thing of beauty.Essentially  the main customer (the Hegemon) and its instrument (the EU) are trying to mask the actual theft of those “frozen” Russian sovereign assets as if this was a legal transaction.The EU will transfer the “frozen” assets – something around $260 billion – to the status of collateral for the American loan. That’s the whole thing – because only the income deriving from the assets would not be enough as collateral to secure the loan.It gets even dicier. These funds will not leave Washington for Kiev; they will remain in town to the benefit of the industrial-military complex churning out more weapons. Globalistan: How the G... Pepe Escobar Best Price: $17.22 Buy New $20.83 (as of 07:20 UTC - Details)So the EU steals the assets  under a flimsy legalese pretext (Janet Yellen already said it’s OK) and transfers them to the U.S. Washington is immune if everything goes wrong – as it will.Only a fool would believe that the Americans would give a sizable loan to a de facto country 404 with a sovereign debt rating in the abyss. The dirty job is assigned to the Europeans: it’s up to the EU to change the status of Russia’s stolen/”frozen” assets to collateral.And wait for the ultimate dicey gambit. The whole scheme concerns Euroclear  in Belgium – where the largest amount of Russian funds is parked. Yet the decision on this money-laundering scam was not taken by Belgium  and not even by the EUrocrats.This was a Hegemon-imposed G7 decision. Belgium is not even part of the G7. Yet in the end  it will be the EU’s “credibility” as a whole that will go down the drain across the whole Global Majority.And the deaf  dumb and blind  predictably  are not even aware of it.The views of individual contributors do not necessarily represent those of the Strategic Culture Foundation.,neutral,0.0,0.68,0.31,mixed,0.11,0.24,0.65,True,English,"['Hegemon Orders', 'Europe', 'War', 'Russia', 'Money', 'Russian UN representative Vasily Nebenzya', 'irreversible multi-nodal (italics mine', 'Duma Chairman Vyacheslav Volodin', 'number one economic/military target', 'Duma Defense Committee', 'vacuous final declaration', 'Pepe Best Price', 'escalatory green light', 'sweaty T-shirt actor', 'multi-centric new system', 'inevitable decapitation strike', 'weapon supply chains', 'key critical point', 'Swiss “peace” kabuki', 'new security system', 'Munich Security Conference', 'real de-nazification campaign', 'real cultural revolution', 'influential business circles', 'proxy war chessboard', 'latest peace offer', 'real target', 'Russian Federation', 'Russian soldiers', 'peace deal', 'security vision', 'informed circles', 'Big Players', 'Saudi Arabia', 'South Africa', 'collective West', 'assorted vassals', 'Raging Twenties', 'Foreign Affairs', 'strategic approach', 'epileptic slab', 'Norwegian wood', 'Verkhovna Rada', 'legitimate entity', 'starting negotiations', 'full responsibility', 'Big Picture', 'Eurasian space', 'steady advance', 'international relations', 'urgent solution', 'dangerous escalation', 'strategic defeat', 'largest arsenal', 'nuclear weapons', 'extreme adventurism', 'Western politicians', 'fiery debate', 'preferred motto', 'military strategy', 'political strategy', 'serious problems', 'Black Sea', 'political center', 'nazi-banderista gangs', 'financial deal', 'Rinat Akhmetov', 'Azovstal works', 'military objectives', 'Dara’a', 'April 2022 negotiations', 'full demilitarization', 'extremist ideology', 'current escalation', 'direct offer', 'almost war', 'several months', 'Andrei Kartapolov', 'legendary speech', 'same time', 'generous proposal', 'current proposal', 'significant refusal', 'Ukraine problem', 'classic case', 'Ukraine territory', 'The Hegemon', 'Vladimir Putin', 'BRICS members', 'winner', 'None', 'emissaries', 'Brazil', 'India', 'UAE', 'Escobar', '03:32 UTC', 'Details', 'diplomats', 'leadership', 'Ministry', 'restrained', 'context', 'practice', 'Kiev', 'NATO', 'parliament', 'Moscow', 'agreement', 'chase', 'conditions', 'head', 'bloodshed', 'anathema', 'elites', 'Kremlin', 'past', 'deaf', 'Calls', 'scale', 'threat', 'belief', 'immunity', 'exclusivity', 'tragedy', 'Critics', 'capitulation', 'oligarchs', 'Transnistria', 'power', 'Odessa', 'example', 'Mariupol', 'control', 'part', 'owner', 'financiers', 'generosity', 'parallel', 'Syria', 'mess', 'risk', 'army', 'Istanbul', 'decades', 'everything', 'focuses', 'tune', 'orders', 'plutocracy', 'show', 'operatives', 'Terror', 'years']",2024-06-22,2024-06-23,lewrockwell.com
