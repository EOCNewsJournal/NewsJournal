The company  planning to transform the World War II-era Kingsway Exchange ...,London Tunnels announced plans to raise £30m through an initial public offering (IPO) on Euronext Amsterdam on Monday  shifting its listing plans from the London Stock Exchange.The company  planning to transform the World War II-era Kingsway Exchange Tunnels in central London into a cultural attraction  expected a market capitalization of £130m on listing on 27 June  according to Dow Jones Newswires.Shares would be issued at 200p each  with a prospectus to be published later on Monday.Originally constructed in the early 1940s as an air-raid shelter for 8 000 people  the tunnels are located beneath Chancery Lane tube station.The development project  pending final planning permission from the London Borough of Camden  had already secured the go-ahead from the City of London Corporation.London Tunnels projected the project to take several years  with a full-scale launch anticipated in 2027.Once operational  the attraction was expected to draw around three million visitors annually.The board estimated the development to cost £20m to £30m over the coming years  with an additional £120m required for the full conversion of the tunnels.That additional funding was set to come from a mix of debt and equity.“We believe a public listing of London Tunnels is the logical next step  improving our ability to raise further capital over the coming years to support the company's growth strategy and create long-term value ” said the firm’s chief executive officer Angus Murray.The move was yet another setback for the London Stock Exchange  which had recently experienced a series of high-profile defections.Irish building materials supplier CRH moved its main listing to New York last September  while Flutter Entertainment transitioned its primary listing to Wall Street on 31 May.Travel giant TUI and British chip maker Arm Holdings had also opted for listings outside of the British capital.Reporting by Josh White for Sharecast.com.,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,neutral,0.02,0.94,0.04,True,English,"['London Tunnels', 'listing plan', 'Euronext Amsterdam', 'World War II-era Kingsway Exchange Tunnels', 'Chancery Lane tube station', 'Irish building materials supplier', 'London Stock Exchange', 'Dow Jones Newswires', 'final planning permission', 'three million visitors', 'logical next step', 'chief executive officer', 'Travel giant TUI', 'initial public offering', 'British chip maker', 'London Tunnels', 'public listing', 'central London', 'London Borough', 'London Corporation', 'Euronext Amsterdam', 'market capitalization', 'early 1940s', 'air-raid shelter', 'several years', 'full-scale launch', 'coming years', 'full conversion', 'growth strategy', 'long-term value', 'Angus Murray', 'high-profile defections', 'New York', 'Flutter Entertainment', 'Wall Street', 'Arm Holdings', 'British capital', 'Josh White', 'Sharecast.com', 'main listing', 'primary listing', 'cultural attraction', 'additional funding', 'listing plans', 'development project', 'additional £', 'IPO', 'Monday', 'company', '27 June', 'Shares', '200p', 'prospectus', '8,000 people', 'Camden', 'City', 'board', 'mix', 'debt', 'equity', 'ability', 'firm', 'move', 'setback', 'series', 'CRH', '31 May', 'listings', 'Reporting']",2024-06-24,2024-06-24,sharecast.com
