43137,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.naturalnews.com/2024-06-24-russia-retrieving-stolen-money-financial-west-collapse.html,This is how Russia can get its stolen money back while leaving the financial West to collapse all on its own – NaturalNews.com,Strategic Intelligence editor Jim Rickards told Steve Bannon of “War Room” this week that Russia has an easy and obvious solution to the West’s attempted theft of Russian assets: put a lien on $40 trillion at the Euroclear custodian  which will lead to financ…,"This is how Russia can get its stolen money back while leaving the financial West to collapse all on its owneditor Jim Rickards told Steve Bannon of ""War Room"" this week that Russia has an easy and obvious solution to the West's attempted theft of Russian assets: put a lien on $40 trillion at the Euroclear custodian  which will lead to financial chaos.Western power brokers have schemed up a clever but deceptive structured product concept for their attempted theft of $300 billion in frozen Russian assets that they plan to use to fund a $50 billion ""loan"" to Ukraine. The glaring problem is that the structured product allows the West to steal the interest on frozen Russian assets.""The way they're stealing the assets is a structured product "" Rickards explained to Bannon  noting the similarities between this financial scheme and the one Western power brokers cooked up in 2008 to try to save themselves from the financial collapse.""You go back to 2008 with all those garbage mortgages out there – how could you turn them into AAA securities? And Wall Street said 'hold my beer and I'll show you how to do it ' and they did  and of course it all collapsed.""As for the situation with the frozen Russian assets  the U.S. is basically trying to ""lend"" Ukraine $50 billion – backed by U.S. taxpayers  of course – by siphoning all the interest collected on the $300 billion in frozen Russian assets.""The $300 billion is going to throw off about $13.5 billion in interest at 4.5 percent ... that's $67.5 billion in interest over five years "" Rickards explained  breaking down the math.""The interest on the $50 billion 'loan' is $2.25 billion per year  times five years is $11.25 billion  and you have to pay back the $50 billion in principle. So you are going to need $61.25 billion at the end of five years to pay back principle and interest on the loan. So we're going to steal $67 billion approximately from Russian interests and that's enough to pay for the $61.25 billion on the loan.""We are building the infrastructure of human freedom and empowering people to be informed  healthy and aware.

""They're stealing the interest.""You can watch the full video interview with Bannon and Rickards at The Burning Platform.(Related: Every move the West makes to try to punish Russia for its special military operation in Ukraine backfires like a boomerang.)Time for Russia to drop the financial nukeWhen the plot eventually fails – and it will – the Western financial house of cards will be shaken like never before. This is because all Russia has to do in response to this threat is to return the favor.""They're going to seize European assets in Russia – oil  infrastructure  telecommunications  retail franchises  luxury goods  and a lot else "" Rickards warns.The really dangerous part  though  is how easy it will be for Russia to sue Euroclear  the clearinghouse that mediates all this in Europe  for wrongful conversion of assets.""Russia will probably win and then take that judgment around the world to start seizing Euroclear assets "" Rickards says. ""Euroclear is a $40 trillion custodian. That will throw the global financial system into chaos.""Keep in mind that when this happens  Russia will not be the responsible party for the subsequent financial collapse. The West is responsible  having baked all this corruption into the financial s**t cake going back decades. Russia simply holds the launch button to deliver long-awaited judgment to the Mystery Babylonian system responsible for all these financial crimes against humanity.The West is playing with fire concerning its relations with Russia.

JOIN US ON TELEGRAM Follow our coverage of the war on the @Kyivpost_official. This week’s shipment is expected to include missiles for the High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems  or HIMARS  which have been fired on targets within Russia in recent weeks and which Ukrainian military leaders say have changed the course of the war dramatically. HIMARS systems can reach further than the Army Tactical Missile System  or ATACMS  which were mostly used until recently. The AP noted that the unnamed officials said they could not verify whether the latest package included ATACMS munitions as well  but did verify that it did not include cluster munitions.

After serving just four months as the Commander of the Joint Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine (AFU)  Yuriy Sodol  has been replaced after an investigation into alleged incompetence and abuse of power. “I have decided to replace the Commander of the Joint Forces of the Armed Forces of Ukraine  Lt. Gen. Yuriy Sodol  with Brig. Gen. Andriy Gnatov ” President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his nightly address on Monday. Sodol was appointed to the position in February  replacing Gen. Serhiy Naiev. He had served as the commander of Ukraine’s Marines  participating in the defense of Mariupol  and leading his troops in battles near Volnovakha. Advertisement Gnatov also rose through the ranks of the Marines. Zelensky’s announcement on Monday came after an investigation into Sodol’s leadership sparked by criticism from a commander of the Azov brigade  Bohdan Krotevych. Krotevych had filed a complaint to the SBU  accusing Sodol of incompetence.Despite Hungary’s obstruction  EU grants first €1.4 billion in frozen Russian assets to Kyiv The EU on Monday unveiled its first package of newly approved funds for Ukraine  agreeing to transfer €1.4 billion ($1.5 billion) backed by frozen Russian assets to help arm Ukraine  AFP reported. The EU said another billion euros will come by the end of the year. The bloc voted in May to send three billion euros a year to Kyiv in interest from those assets  mostly held by the international deposit organization Euroclear  based in Belgium. The move comes despite protests from Hungary  whose leader Viktor Orban is seen as close to the Kremlin and has attempted to thwart virtually every measure from Brussels to arm Ukraine. AFP reported that “the EU’s other 26 member states have been hashing out a legal route to unlock the funds without needing approval from Hungary.” Advertisement About €200 billion in all has been frozen in European banks since shortly after the beginning of Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. “The windfall profits coming from Russian assets frozen in Europe  not the asset itself  will be used in the swiftest possible manner for the benefit of Ukraine ” EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell said. Meanwhile  as EU leaders’ patience for Hungary’s obstructionism is running thin  Budapest is fuming about being muted in Brussels. “By completely ignoring European rules Hungary was quite simply left out of the decision-making process ” foreign minister Peter Szijjarto said. “This is a clear red line. Never before has such shameless disregard for common European rules been shown.” US State Department says Pyongyang gave Russia missiles  worried Kim may get nuclear help in return US Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell told a foreign policy conference on Monday that Russian President Vladimir Putin’s visit to North Korea last week  the first in nearly a quarter of a century  may lead to “provocative” steps that could lead to a crisis in Northeast Asia. Advertisement Campbell said that Moscow received “literally trainloads” of North Korean artillery ammunition and long-range missiles as a result of the meeting and that the State Department is very concerned about what Pyongyang was promised in return. “We believe that there are discussions about what North Korea gets in exchange. This could be associated with its nuclear or long-range missile development plans ” Campbell said.

He didn’t elaborate on the reasons for the move.Sodol was the commander of Ukraine’s land forces in the east and south that have been struggling to push back Russia’s offensive  which has gained momentum in recent months. Among Russia’s stated goals for the invasion of Ukraine is the takeover of the whole of the Donbas region  comprising Donetsk and Luhansk.EU sanctions 27 ships it says are helping Russian war machineThe European Union placed sanctions on more than two dozen vessels  including 17 that hauled oil for Moscow.The sanctions follow similar steps taken by the UK  which included so-called dark fleet ships on a list of entities it sanctioned earlier this month.Among the vessels to be sanctioned are the Robon  which last year was filmed transferring Russian oil miles away from the location it was signalling  and the Andromeda Star  which suffered a crash near Denmark earlier this year. The Robon has been stationed in the Baltic Sea ever since it was named by UK authorities.Since it invaded Ukraine  a fleet of several hundred ships has built up to service Russia’s oil exports. Those vessels often operate outside the oversight of industry-standard service providers  calling into question how safe they are.The International Maritime Organization last year called on member states to prevent illegal operations by the shadow fleet through resolution A.1192(33). The EU cited that resolution for 11 of the vessels it sanctioned.The sanctions prevent access to ports in Europe as well as the ability to sell  charter  operate or crew such a vessel. The measure also prohibits European operators from providing supplies and services such as insurance  brokering  financing and bunkering  as well as engaging in ship-to-ship transfers or any other transfer of cargo with the vessels or getting services from them.A total of 27 ships were sanctioned  including two ships that store liquefied natural gas and general cargo vessels that carry restricted goods or are linked to sanctioned entities. The list grew from an original proposal of a dozen ships and more vessels could be added in future sanctions packages.Deadly attack in Russia stirs fears of extremist violenceA deadly attack by gunmen in the majority Muslim region of Dagestan just months after the assault on a Moscow concert hall has raised the spectre that Russia may be facing a wave of violence by religious extremists.Security services said terrorists were behind Sunday’s attacks that targeted two churches and a synagogue in the often violence-wracked region in southern Russia. At least 15 police officers and four civilians  including a priest  were killed  Russia’s Investigative Committee said on Monday on Telegram.Among six militants who were killed  three were sons and a nephew of a local official that the ruling United Russia party later expelled  according to the Interfax news service. Investigators were trying to establish who was responsible for organising the attacks.A close ally of President Vladimir Putin  the speaker of Russia’s upper house of parliament  Valentina Matviyenko  alleged Russia had information of “confirmed foreign funding” for the attack. Law enforcement agencies “will clear out extremist cells in the shortest possible time  complete investigative actions and reliably establish” where and to whom threads lead  she said.The assault came three months after gunmen carried out the worst atrocity in Moscow for two decades  killing more than 140 people in an attack on the Crocus City Hall concert venue on 22 March. Russia initially pointed the finger at Ukraine for the assault that was claimed by Islamic State. Security services eventually acknowledged that Islamic State’s branch in Afghanistan was behind the Moscow attack  the biggest single loss of life in the capital since Chechen separatists took hostages in 2002 at the Nord-Ost theatre.The Islamic State’s Afghan subsidiary issued a statement on its Russian-language Al-Azaim channel praising the militant assault in Dagestan  which it said was carried out “by our brothers from the Caucasus”  according to the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War.The latest attacks stood out for their coordination and scale. Russian Telegram channels posted several videos of men wearing black T-shirts shooting at police cars. Another video depicted a fire destroying a synagogue.“There’s a huge problem with Islamic extremism in Russia  which is spreading ” said Sergei Markov  a political consultant close to the Kremlin. “Islamic State and other groups are active.”That a local official’s relatives were among the militants “shows that radical Islam has gone deep into society and penetrated the elite”  Markov said.Islamist groups have targeted Russia in the past  citing what they call anti-Muslim policies by the Kremlin.In October  a mob encircled a flight from Israel at the airport in Dagestan’s regional capital of Makhachkala in protest at Israel’s war against the militant group Hamas in Gaza. It took hours to restore order.A Dagestani legislator from the ruling pro-Kremlin party  Abdulkhakim Gadzhiev  accused the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (Nato) states and Ukraine of plotting the latest attack.Dmitry Rogozin  a senator in Russia’s upper house of parliament who has served as deputy prime minister  warned that ascribing every homegrown terrorist act to Nato and Ukraine “will cause big problems for us”  in a post on his Telegram account.Russia’s insistence on blaming radical Islamic violence on Ukraine and its allies was making it impossible to counter it effectively  said Gregory Shvedov  an expert on southern Russia’s mainly Muslim regions.Denmark to end F-16 pilot training for Ukraine at year-endDenmark will end its training programme for Ukrainian pilots of F-16 warplanes at the end of the year to focus on its new fighter jets  the Nordic country’s defence minister said.Once the programme was complete  Denmark would have trained “about” 20 pilots from Ukraine  Troels Lund Poulsen said at a news briefing on Monday. The Scandinavian nation last year pledged to send 19 F-16s to Kyiv once it had trained pilots to fly them.The F-16 coalition led by countries including the US  Netherlands and Denmark will have to look at alternative locations  in addition to an already established training facility in Romania  to continue the activities  Lund Poulsen said.Read more: Ukraine to get F-16s from Nato allies  with Denmark pledging 19“We will be transitioning to flying the F-35  so we need to spend our energy on that  and so we cannot continue training Ukrainian pilots after 2024 ” the defence minister said. Denmark has ordered 27 new F-35 planes  though delivery has been hit by several delays.EU backs Russian asset profits for Ukraine by dodging Orbán vetoEuropean Union member states agreed on a plan to send Ukraine €1.4-billion in military aid from the windfall profits of frozen Russian assets after finding a way to circumvent a Hungarian veto.The decision was approved as EU foreign ministers met in Luxembourg on Monday  according to diplomats.The move came after Josep Borrell  the EU’s top diplomat  suggested that Viktor Orbán’s government could be essentially stripped of a vote on the issue  given that Hungary has abstained from a previous EU decision authorising the use of the funds.“The treaty provides legal ways to advance even if some member state doesn’t want to participate ” Borrell said. “Since Hungary didn’t participate in the decision  it shouldn’t participate in the implementation.”Borrell’s proposal to circumvent Hungary “breaks European rules”  Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó said in a social media post ahead of the meeting.Hungary  the EU’s most pro-Russia nation  has blocked some €6.5-billion of urgently needed military aid for Kyiv as Ukraine’s military seeks to fend off Russian assaults. That’s after Orbán dropped his veto in February over a broader €50-billion financial aid package for Ukraine.Budapest’s blocks have prompted anxiety about the use of the profits from frozen Russian assets. That money would be used directly for weapons purchases for Ukraine  rather than to reimburse member states that provide such aid for Kyiv.About $280-billion in assets have been immobilised by the Group of Seven nations since Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine  with more than two-thirds of those held in the EU. The vast majority of the funds has been held through the Belgium-based settlement giant EuroclearThe €1.4-billion tranche  due to be sent in the coming weeks  is part of more than €2.5-billion earmarked for Ukraine from such funds for this year.Russia summons US envoy over Ukraine missile strike in CrimeaThe Russian Foreign Ministry summoned US Ambassador Lynne Tracy over an attack by Ukraine on the occupied Crimean peninsula.The US “bears equal responsibility” with Ukraine for the attack and Russia would retaliate  the Foreign Ministry in Moscow said in a statement on Monday.Read more: Crimea attacked after Ukraine shot down missiles Near KyivRussian officials said four people were killed  including two children  and more than 150 people were injured in what Russia said was an Atacms missile attack in Sevastopol  Crimea’s largest city  on Sunday. Russia’s Defence Ministry said its air defences downed four missiles while a fifth was struck and diverted from its trajectory before exploding over the city.The US began supplying Kyiv with Atacms missiles earlier this year.Russia  which began a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022  seized Crimea in 2014.

At the recent Cannes Lions  the world’s most prestigious advertising festival  the campaign won the highest distinction  the Prix Dan Wieden Titanium Lion for creating a ground-breaking and transformative showcase for Outdoor effectiveness and the power of storytelling. Together  DAVID Madrid and JCDecaux challenged the traditional conventions of the industry. Thanks to this approach  they also won a Grand Prix in Creative B2B  the first Spanish campaign to win this category. These latest awards place Spain in third place out of countries as ranked by creativity and effectiveness relating to the provision of professional products and services. 'Meet Marina Prieto' was awarded in multiple categories  winning a Gold Lion in Outdoor  a Bronze Lion in Creative B2B  and a Silver Lion and a Bronze Lion in Social & Influencer.The campaign has already been successful at the D&AD Awards  where it won a Graphite pencil in the Media (Micro-Talent & Influencers) category  as well as two Wood pencils in Digital & Social and in Direct (Press & Out-of-Home). These awards underscore the significant social  cultural  and advertising impact of the campaign.The 100-year-old Galician woman who captivated commuters on the Madrid MetroThe innovative campaign by DAVID Madrid  which was displayed in the Madrid Metro  has demonstrated the effectiveness of OOH and shown its ability to engage audiences. To reach this objective  the agency chose to highlight genuine everyday moments in the life of Marina Prieto  an endearing 100-year-old Galician woman who regularly shares photos with her family on Instagram. Posters with the strapline “Meet Marina” featuring Marina in a range of everyday scenes including her birthday and daily nap were soon displayed across the Madrid Metro – generating huge curiosity among Madrileños who wondered who she was. People began searching for information about Marina  to talk about her on social networks and even began taking selfies with the posters. The campaign’s objective was to generate a word-of-mouth buzz and to take Marina's influence beyond social media  sharing it in locations where people gather each day. Marina's posts were displayed in more than 800 advertising spaces in the Madrid Metro network  including central stations such as Nuevos Ministerios  Moncloa  and Lavapiés. This campaign showcased the transformative power of Out-of-Home media. The campaign generated more than 400 000 impressions in just one week and achieved interactions with 92 000 unique accounts in one month. Marina's Instagram account went from having just a few followers to over 10 000  making her a public figure and demonstrating the significant influence she has had on society.Jean-Charles Decaux  Chairman of the Executive Board and Co-CEO of JCDecaux  said: “We are very proud to have been awarded the prestigious Titanium Prix and 5 other major prizes. This work is not just a creative idea. It is about changing perceptions and enhancing the value of Out-of-Home: a powerful medium in the daily lives of people that brings them together and generates lasting interactions with audiences  as powerfully shown by the Marina campaign in the metro. It has also demonstrated the role of JCDecaux in the metro  which makes passengers' journeys informative  entertaining and event-driven  enabling brands to build a high-quality daily relationship with their audiences. The campaign has also highlighted the key role of metro advertising and more generally of outdoor advertising in omnichannel communication strategies  creating synergies between offline and online campaigns. On behalf of the JCDecaux Executive Board  we congratulate our Spanish teams for their success. This is a great honour for our Group which also reaffirms Spain's excellence in the creation of internationally renowned campaigns.”Key Figures for JCDecaux2023 revenue: €3 570.0m (a)N°1 Out-of-Home Media company worldwideA daily audience of 850 million people in more than 80 countries1 056 833 advertising panels worldwidePresent in 3 918 cities with more than 10 000 inhabitants11 650 employeesJCDecaux is listed on the Eurolist of Euronext Paris and is part of the Euronext 100 and Euronext Family Business indexesJCDecaux is recognised for its extra-financial performance in the FTSE4Good (3.4/5)  CDP (A)  MSCI (AAA)  Sustainalytics (13.7)  and has achieved Gold Medal status from EcoVadis1st Out-of-Home Media company to join the RE100Leader in self-service bike rental scheme: pioneer in eco-friendly mobilityN°1 worldwide in street furniture (630 196 advertising panels)N°1 worldwide in transport advertising with 153 airports and 258 contracts in metros  buses  trains and tramways (319 081 advertising panels)N°1 in Europe for billboards (85 743 advertising panels worldwide)N°1 in outdoor advertising in Europe (708 620 advertising panels)N°1 in outdoor advertising in Asia-Pacific (165 292 advertising panels)N°1 in outdoor advertising in Latin America (91 682 advertising panels)N°1 in outdoor advertising in Africa (25 337 advertising panels)N°1 in outdoor advertising in the Middle East (21 300 advertising panels)(a) Adjusted revenueFor more information about JCDecaux  please visit jcdecaux.com .Join us on Twitter   LinkedIn   Facebook   Instagram and YouTube.Communications Department: Albert Asséraf+33 (0) 1 30 79 79 10 – albert.asseraf@jcdecaux.comInvestor Relations: Rémi Grisard+33 (0) 1 30 79 79 93 – remi.grisard@jcdecaux.comAttachment",neutral,0.21,0.79,0.0,mixed,0.68,0.12,0.2,True,English,"['Dan Wieden Titanium Prix', 'Meet Marina Prieto"" campaign', 'JCDecaux Spain', 'Cannes Lions', '6 awards', 'Prix Dan Wieden Titanium Lion', 'Dan Wieden Titanium Prix', 'self-service bike rental scheme', 'endearing 100-year-old Galician woman', 'Euronext Family Business indexes', 'one outdoor advertising company', 'prestigious Titanium Prix', 'Meet Marina Prieto"" campaign', 'two Wood pencils', '5 other major prizes', 'omnichannel communication strategies', 'international advertising festivals', 'prestigious advertising festival', 'genuine everyday moments', 'Gold Medal status', 'high-quality daily relationship', 'recent Cannes Lions', 'D&AD Awards', 'Home Media company', 'first Spanish campaign', 'creative advertising campaigns', 'Madrid Metro network', 'JCDecaux Executive Board', 'Grand Prix', 'Gold Lion', 'one week', 'one month', 'Bronze Lion', 'Silver Lion', 'advertising impact', '800 advertising spaces', '1,056,833 advertising panels', 'everyday scenes', 'Spanish teams', 'online campaigns', 'renowned campaigns', 'metro advertising', 'Creative B2B', 'daily nap', 'creative idea', 'daily lives', 'daily audience', 'June 24th', 'highest distinction', 'transformative showcase', 'DAVID Madrid', 'traditional conventions', 'third place', 'professional products', 'multiple categories', 'Graphite pencil', 'huge curiosity', 'Madrileños', 'central stations', 'Nuevos Ministerios', 'Lavapiés', '92,000 unique accounts', 'Jean-Charles Decaux', 'powerful medium', 'great honour', 'Key Figures', 'extra-financial performance', 'EcoVadis 1st', 'eco-friendly mobility', 'N°1 wor', 'Euronext Paris', 'innovative campaign', 'Marina campaign', 'social media', 'latest awards', 'Outdoor effectiveness', 'JCDecaux SE', 'outstanding success', 'social networks', 'transformative power', 'Instagram account', 'significant influence', 'lasting interactions', 'key role', '850 million people', 'JCDecaux Spain', 'Euronext 100', '6 awards', 'number', 'world', 'ground-breaking', 'storytelling', 'industry', 'approach', 'category', 'countries', 'creativity', 'provision', 'services', 'Influencer', 'Micro-Talent', 'Digital', 'Direct', 'commuters', 'OOH', 'ability', 'audiences', 'objective', 'agency', 'life', 'photos', 'Posters', 'strapline', 'range', 'birthday', 'information', 'selfies', 'word', 'mouth', 'buzz', 'locations', 'posts', 'Moncloa', '400,000 impressions', 'followers', 'society', 'Chairman', 'CEO', 'perceptions', 'value', 'passengers', 'journeys', 'brands', 'synergies', 'offline', 'behalf', 'Group', 'excellence', 'creation', 'internationally', '2023 revenue', '3,918 cities', '10,000 inhabitants', '11,650 employees', 'Eurolist', 'part', 'FTSE4Good', 'CDP', 'MSCI', 'AAA', 'Sustainalytics', 'RE100', 'Leader', 'pioneer']",2024-06-24,2024-06-25,globenewswire.com

This decision marks the second approval the Company has received for IXCHIQ® following approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in November 2023. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) also recently recommended marketing authorization of the vaccine in Europe  and a formal decision is expected in the third quarter of 2024.IXCHIQ® is the world’s only licensed chikungunya vaccine available to address this unmet medical need. Every year  over 50 million North Americans  of which approximately 7 million Canadians1  travel to countries where chikungunya is endemic. Valneva began commercializing the vaccine in the U.S. this year and plans to sell first doses in Canada in the fourth quarter of 2024.Juan Carlos Jaramillo  M.D.  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  commented  “This second approval marks another significant milestone toward introducing a preventative solution against chikungunya disease worldwide. In recent years  climate change has caused the Aedes mosquito  a known carrier of chikungunya and dengue viruses  to spread to areas that were previously unaffected. The broader we can make this vaccine accessible  the better we will mitigate the burden of this debilitating illness  and we would like to thank our partner  CEPI  for supporting us in this endeavor.”In addition to U.S.  Canada and Europe  Valneva partnered with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) 2 and Instituto Butantan in Brazil3 to make the vaccine more accessible to Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMIC). The collaboration falls within the framework of the agreement signed between CEPI and Valneva in July 20194  which provides funding of up to $24.6 million with support from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 program. A marketing authorization application is currently under review by the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency (ANVISA) with potential approval in 2024.Dr. Richard Hatchett  Chief Executive Officer of CEPI  commented: “Health Canada’s approval of IXCHIQ® represents another significant advance in the fight against the debilitating chikungunya virus. Accelerated by climate change  the size and frequency of chikungunya outbreaks are increasing  with hundreds of thousands of cases already reported so far this year in the Americas  South Asia  and Africa. This is why CEPI  with its partners Valneva and the European Commission  are working to expand access to the vaccine for everyone  including the world’s most vulnerable populations.”Health Canada’s approval was based on data from the pivotal Phase 3 study which were published in The Lancet  one of the world’s leading peer-reviewed medical journal  and showed a 98.9% seroresponse rate at 28 days with a single vaccination. This immune response was sustained for six months by 96.3% of participants and was equally durable in younger and older adults5.About ChikungunyaChikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne viral disease spread by the bites of infected female Aedes mosquitoes which causes fever  severe joint pain  muscle pain  headache  nausea  fatigue and rash. Joint pain is often debilitating and can persist for weeks to years.6In 2004  the disease began to spread quickly  causing large-scale outbreaks around the world. Since the re-emergence of the virus  CHIKV has now been identified in over 110 countries in Asia  Africa  Europe and the Americas.7 Between 2013 and 2023  more than 3.7 million cases were reported in the Americas8 and the economic impact is considered to be significant. The medical and economic burden is expected to grow with climate change as the mosquito vectors that transmit the disease continue to spread geographically. As such  the World Health Organization (WHO) has highlighted chikungunya as a major public health problem.9About IXCHIQ®In Canada  IXCHIQTM (chikungunya vaccine  live  attenuated) Powder for Solution for Intramuscular Injection is intended for active immunization in individuals 18 years and older for the prevention of disease caused by the chikungunya virus (CHIKV)  as a single-dose immunization.About Valneva SEWe are a specialty vaccine company that develops  manufactures  and commercializes prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases addressing unmet medical needs.

The firm's decision reflects the anticipated success of UCB's recent product introductions.The Barclays analyst noted the upward revision in the company's financial projections for the fiscal years 2024 to 2026. This adjustment accounts for the robust performance of the company's multiple product launches. Despite the positive outlook  the analyst also mentioned a potential dilution effect arising from the bridging program for Bimzelx  UCB's psoriasis treatment.Looking at the short-term financial outlook  the analyst expressed caution regarding the first half of 2024. Current projections suggest a potential decline when compared to the Bloomberg consensus  with an expected 7% decrease in sales and an 18% drop in adjusted EBITDA. This anticipated downturn is attributed to the growth momentum shifting towards the second half of the year.The analyst's commentary underscores a strategic consideration for UCB  as the company navigates the introduction of new products in a competitive market. While the immediate financials may not align with broader market expectations  the analyst's rating indicates a confidence in the company's long-term performance driven by its recent launches.In other recent news  UCB SA has seen its target price raised by Citi  based on the firm's more optimistic view of the company's growth prospects for the years 2024 to 2029. The upgrade  which sees the target price rise from €126.00 to €161.00  is driven by factors including anticipated faster revenue growth and higher peak sales for UCB's products Bimzelx and Rystiggo. Citi also expects an atopic dermatitis asset from UCB's pipeline to advance into Phase III clinical trials  boosting the company's prospects even further.The dynamics surrounding another UCB product  Cimzia  were also highlighted by Citi  with potential benefits expected from the delayed market entry of competitor Xbrane's biosimilar until at least 2029. Revenue increases could also come from a Phase II combination study of Johnson & Johnson's nipocalimab in rheumatoid arthritis.Other factors bolstering UCB's financial outlook include the underappreciated dynamics of Evenity  the extension of intellectual property for Fintepla until 2033  and royalty revenues from Merck and Sanofi (NASDAQ: )'s oral PCSK9/TNFi pipeline assets. According to Citi's forecasts  UCB's sales  EBITDA  and EPS are expected to grow at compound annual growth rates of 11%  27%  and 33%  respectively  from 2024 to 2029.InvestingPro InsightsWith UCB SA's (Euronext Brussels:UCB) stock trading near its 52-week high  Barclays' updated price target to €160.00 reflects the company's strong performance and promising product pipeline.

No other chief of a major French company has publicly expressed disquiet.“There is also a lot of concern about other things that are not economic  for example about what is happening to the unity of French society and the risks that this unity  which could be damaged  could have an impact on business ” Boujnah added.An IFOP opinion poll projected the RN would win 36% of votes in the first round  ahead of the left-wing New Popular Front (NFP) bloc on 28.5% and President Emmanuel Macron’s centrist alliance on 21%. France’s voting system means the second round can still deliver surprises.‘CIVIL WAR’Seeking to cast their centrist camp as the last hope for stability  Macron and his allies have turned up the volume on warnings the country could face chaos if either of ‘the extremes’ on the right or left wins power.Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire has warned of a potential financial crisis  while Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin has said police were preparing for possible riots related to the vote.But surveys from all main polling institutes indicate the strategy  reminiscent of the British government’s communication ahead of the 2016 Brexit vote dubbed ‘project fear’  is not paying off. Macron’s Together coalition remains well behind.In the strongest comments so far  Macron said in a podcast released on Monday that both the RN party and the New Popular Front risked bringing “civil war” to France.“The strategy of Mr Macron now is me or chaos ” said Vincent Martigny  political science professor at the University of Nice.“He’s playing a very dangerous game because he wants to appear as a moderate  a stable point  but he is perceived as the one who has been putting the French in such a messy situation.”RN leader Le Pen on Tuesday rebuffed Macron’s allegations.“I think the French have realised that the chaos is him (Macron)  he has embodied chaos since he was first elected ” she told RTL radio.MARKET JITTERSThe president’s surprise call for snap elections earlier this month triggered a heavy selloff of French stocks and bonds.France’s economic model makes the country vulnerable when interest rates attached to its sovereign and corporate bonds shoot up  said Boujnah  whose company also runs stock markets in other European hubs including Amsterdam and Milan.“To continue to finance a system in which 58% of what we create is injected into public spending  we have to borrow heavily from the rest of the world. And we need the rest of the world to give us loans ” he said.Investors and ratings agencies have raised concern about RN’s policies such as a pledge to cut value-added tax on energy from 20% to 5.5% and to lower the legal retirement age.So far  the party has been hesitant to put price tags on its policies  despite promises it would keep France’s state budget within the boundaries agreed within the EU.Jean-Philippe Tanguy  RN’s financial pointman  on Tuesday said the party’s plan to reverse Macron’s pension reform  bringing the legal retirement age back to 62  would cost the state 9 billion euros ($9.65 billion).“It will be compensated by other measures”  he told France Inter radio  adding “our programme is balanced”.($1 = 0.9323 euros)(Reporting by Tassilo Hummel  Dominique Vidalon  Blandine Henault and Johnny Cotton; editing by Christina Fincher  William Maclean),neutral,0.07,0.92,0.02,negative,0.0,0.29,0.71,True,English,"['Paris stock market head', 'French elections', 'Investors', 'left-wing New Popular Front (NFP) bloc', 'Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire', 'Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin', 'Paris stock market head', 'Paris stock market operator', 'RN leader Le Pen', 'Euronext CEO Stephane Boujnah', 'Marine Le Pen', 'eurosceptic, nationalist movement', 'IFOP opinion poll', 'main polling institutes', 'political science professor', 'legal retirement age', 'rare political comments', 'potential financial crisis', 'other European hubs', 'right National Rally', 'snap parliamentary elections', 'major French company', 'President Emmanuel Macron', 'France Inter radio', 'left-wing coalition', 'MARKET JITTERS', 'stock markets', 'snap elections', 'strongest comments', 'financial pointman', 'RTL radio', 'other chief', 'other things', 'other measures', 'French elections', 'Tassilo Hummel', 'government experience', 'chief executive', 'euro zone', 'biggest economy', 'total uncertainty', 'first round', 'centrist alliance', 'second round', 'CIVIL WAR', 'centrist camp', 'last hope', 'possible riots', 'British government', 'Vincent Martigny', 'dangerous game', 'moderate, a', 'stable point', 'messy situation', 'surprise call', 'heavy selloff', 'economic model', 'interest rates', 'public spending', 'ratings agencies', 'value-added tax', 'price tags', 'Jean-Philippe Tanguy', 'pension reform', 'Dominique Vidalon', 'Blandine Henault', 'Johnny Cotton', 'Christina Fincher', 'William Maclean', 'French society', 'French stocks', 'business elite', 'business figure', 'extreme party', 'most votes', 'voting system', '2016 Brexit vote', 'corporate bonds', 'state budget', 'RN) party', 'RN party', 'Mr Macron', 'Investors', 'reuters_tickers', '4 minutes', 'prospect', 'little', 'power', 'Tuesday', 'June', 'July', 'team', 'debates', 'cafes', 'workplaces', 'disquiet', 'lot', 'concern', 'example', 'unity', 'risks', 'impact', 'surprises', 'stability', 'allies', 'volume', 'warnings', 'country', 'chaos', 'extremes', 'police', 'surveys', 'strategy', 'communication', 'project', 'podcast', 'Monday', 'University', 'Nice', 'allegations', 'sovereign', 'Amsterdam', 'Milan', 'world', 'loans', 'policies', 'pledge', 'energy', 'promises', 'boundaries', 'plan', 'billion', 'programme', '0.9323 euros']",2024-06-25,2024-06-25,swissinfo.ch

But the group also extends into water  energy and transport.NOTE: M Group’s website states that the company employs 11 000 people  has a turnover of over £2bn and works in 216 UK locations.However  a recent report on Sky News claims that Luxembourg-based CVC  which floated on the Euronext Amsterdam Stock Exchange during May 2024  is now the final remaining bidder for M Group after seeing off rival interest from Apollo Global Management and others. A deal is expected to be signed sometime this summer.Such an agreement would also need the blessing of private equity firm PAI Partners  which since 2018 has been the majority owner of M Group (Citi are said to be advising PAI on the process). The deal  if approved  could give M Group an important boost and help them to expand  although they don’t appear to be short of orders.According to M Group’s last investor update in November 2023  the company’s order book and bid pipeline were continuing to grow. On 30th September 2023  the order book was £6.7 billion (vs £5.4 billion last year) with a further £400m awaiting signature. This provided visibility for 94% of their FY24 budget revenues (up from 86% a year ago).,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,neutral,0.06,0.93,0.01,True,English,"['UK Street Works Firm M Group', 'CVC Capital Partners', 'private equity giant CVC Capital Partners', 'mobile focused civil engineering brands', 'Euronext Amsterdam Stock Exchange', 'possible £1.5bn acquisition deal', 'private equity firm', 'final remaining bidder', 'Apollo Global Management', 'last investor update', 'FY24 budget revenues', 'M Group Services', 'Luxembourg-based CVC', 'mobile operators', 'PAI Partners', 'Infrastructure firm', 'Jun 25th', 'other things', 'various broadband', 'Avonline Networks', 'advanced talks', 'Telecom Division', 'full end', 'end service', 'telecom infrastructure', 'key clients', 'Virgin Media', 'recent report', 'Sky News', 'rival interest', 'majority owner', 'important boost', 'order book', 'bid pipeline', '30th September', 'Three UK', '216 UK locations', 'Tuesday', 'Score', 'Ireland', 'magdalene', 'Morrison', 'waldon', 'everything', 'design', 'build', 'maintenance', 'Openreach', 'Gigaclear', 'CTIL', 'Hyperoptic', 'MBNL', 'water', 'energy', 'transport', 'NOTE', 'website', 'company', '11,000 people', 'turnover', 'May', 'others', 'agreement', 'blessing', 'Citi', 'process', 'orders', 'November', 'signature', 'visibility']",2024-06-25,2024-06-25,ispreview.co.uk
