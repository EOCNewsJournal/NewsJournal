Despite this downturn  Arkema maintains a stable dividend history over the past decade  supported by a payout ratio of 74.9% and cash payout ratio of 45.9%  indicating that dividends are well-covered by both earnings and cash flow. However  its current dividend yield of 4.17% is below the top quartile of French dividend stocks at 5.55%.

Despite this positive trajectory  Amundi's dividend history is relatively short and marked by volatility over its 8-year span. The appointment of Barry Glavin as head of equity investments could signal strategic enhancements aimed at stabilizing these payouts.

No other chief of a major French company has publicly expressed disquiet.""There is also a lot of concern about other things that are not economic  for example about what is happening to the unity of French society and the risks that this unity  which could be damaged  could have an impact on business "" Boujnah added.Seeking to cast their centrist camp as the last hope for stability  President EmmanuelMacron and his allies have turned up the volume on warnings the country could face chaos if either of 'the extremes' on the right or left wins power.Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire has warned of a potential financial crisis  while Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin has said police were preparing for possible riots related to the vote.But surveys from all main polling institutes indicate the strategy  reminiscent of the British government's communication ahead of the 2016 Brexit vote dubbed 'project fear'  is not paying off. Macron's Together coalition remains well behind.In the strongest comments so far  Macron said in a podcast released on Monday that both the RN party and the New Popular Front risked bringing ""civil war"" to France.RN leader Le Pen on Tuesday rebuffed these allegations.""I think the French have realised that the chaos is him (Macron)  he has embodied chaos since he was first elected "" she told RTL radio.The president's surprise call for snap elections earlier this month triggered a heavy selloff of French stocks and bonds.France's economic model makes the country vulnerable when interest rates attached to its sovereign and corporate bonds shoot up  said Boujnah  whose company also runs stock markets in other European hubs including Amsterdam and Milan.""To continue to finance a system in which 58% of what we create is injected into public spending  we have to borrow heavily from the rest of the world. And we need the rest of the world to give us loans "" he said.Investors and ratings agencies have raised concern about RN's policies such as a pledge to cut value-added tax on energy from 20% to 5.5% and to lower the legal retirement age.So far  the party has been hesitant to put price tags on its policies  despite promises it would keep France's state budget within the boundaries agreed within the EU.Jean-Philippe Tanguy  RN's financial pointman  on Tuesday said the party's plan to reverse Macron's pension reform  bringing the legal retirement age back to 62  would cost the state 9 billion euros ($9.65 billion).""It will be compensated by other measures""  he told France Inter radio  adding ""our programme is balanced"".",negative,0.01,0.48,0.51,negative,0.0,0.26,0.74,True,English,"['Paris stock market head', 'French snap elections', 'investors', 'Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire', 'Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin', 'Civil War Market Jitters', 'Paris stock market operator', 'RN leader Le Pen', 'Euronext CEO Stephane Boujnah', 'Marine Le Pen', 'eurosceptic, nationalist movement', 'main polling institutes', 'New Popular Front', 'legal retirement age', 'rare political comments', 'potential financial crisis', 'other European hubs', 'right National Rally', 'snap parliamentary elections', 'major French company', 'France Inter radio', 'snap elections', 'strongest comments', 'stock markets', 'financial pointman', 'RTL radio', 'other chief', 'other things', 'other measures', 'government experience', 'chief executive', 'most votes', 'euro zone', 'biggest economy', 'total uncertainty', 'French society', 'centrist camp', 'last hope', 'possible riots', 'British government', 'surprise call', 'heavy selloff', 'French stocks', 'economic model', 'interest rates', 'public spending', 'ratings agencies', 'value-added tax', 'price tags', 'Jean-Philippe Tanguy', 'pension reform', 'business elite', 'business figure', 'extreme party', 'RN) party', 'RN party', 'left-wing coalition', 'President EmmanuelMacron', '2016 Brexit vote', 'corporate bonds', 'state budget', 'prospect', 'little', 'power', 'investors', 'Tuesday', 'June', 'July', 'team', 'debates', 'cafes', 'workplaces', 'disquiet', 'lot', 'concern', 'example', 'unity', 'risks', 'impact', 'stability', 'allies', 'volume', 'warnings', 'country', 'chaos', 'extremes', 'police', 'surveys', 'strategy', 'communication', 'project', 'podcast', 'Monday', 'allegations', 'sovereign', 'Amsterdam', 'Milan', 'system', 'world', 'loans', 'policies', 'pledge', 'energy', 'promises', 'boundaries', 'plan', 'billion', 'programme']",2024-06-25,2024-06-26,timesofindia.indiatimes.com

These products constitute about 17% of revenues for DB1 and around 12% for Euronext ENX.Moreover  French President Macron's unexpected decision to hold parliamentary elections increased equity market volatility in the last three weeks of the quarter  boosting trading activity in both equity index futures and cash equities.“Given the recent increase in trading activity and volatility in recent weeks  we expect to see upward revisions to Q2:24 consensus EPS for the exchanges with higher exposure to transactional revenues ” analysts at UBS said in a note  reiterating Buy ratings for both companies.,neutral,0.08,0.91,0.01,neutral,0.09,0.85,0.06,True,English,"['Q2 EPS estimates', 'UBS', 'ENX', 'DB1', 'consensus', 'Investing', 'com', 'Deutsche Börse Group', 'various central banks', 'French President Macron', 'equity index futures', 'last three weeks', 'equity market volatility', '2024-2026 earnings estimates', 'higher trading revenues', 'Q2:24 consensus EPS', 'Q2 2024 earnings', 'recent weeks', 'trading activity', 'higher exposure', 'transactional revenues', 'transactional activity', 'monetary policy', 'interest rate', 'unexpected decision', 'parliamentary elections', 'cash equities', 'recent increase', 'upward revisions', 'Buy ratings', 'commodity products', 'European exchanges', 'UBS analysts', 'Euronext ENX', 'share', 'NII', 'DB1', 'uncertainty', 'FX', 'quarter', 'note', 'companies']",2024-06-25,2024-06-26,investing.com

So  elections are freezing the world for the next couple of months  and we are waiting for a much more calm and steady market scenario to go public. I don’t think now would be a good time to be represented in the market. But we will be back.”On June 18  the Italian luxury sneaker company’s highly anticipated IPO was postponed just days before it was set to hit the Euronext Milan on Friday.Watch on FNAside from touching on the company’s latest headline-making news  Campara doubled down on how Golden Goose is elevating its experiential marketing and innovation through a U.S. lens.“Everyone is talking about experiences  but what is their retention rate in their stores ” the CEO said. “It’s quite easy to do customer acquisition but very difficult to maintain retention. When we first investing in customer acquisition on Google years ago  it would cost $24 a customer in the U.S.  and now its $78 a customer in the U.S. – which even comes with a low retention rate.”“So  that’s why we invested 10 million euros in building our Haus of Dreamers in Venice and building out our Forward store concept ” Campara said. “These new stores offer consumers a way to interact with our footwear in all aspects of a shoe’s life – from initial sale  to offering repairs and have a place for them to recycle their shoes.”As for what specific experiences Golden Goose is focused on building out is its new Younique café store concept. “Coffee culture  especially in Asia  has grown in popularity over the last few years ” Campara noted. “That’s why we recently opened our first Younique café Bangkok.

43214,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.investing.com/news/press-releases/eurofins-responds-to-muddy-waters-report-93CH-3494889,Eurofins Responds to Muddy Waters Report By Investing.com,Eurofins Responds to Muddy Waters Report,LUXEMBOURG--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Regulatory News:Eurofins (Paris:ERF):The management of Eurofins is aware of a short seller report made by Muddy Waters (NYSE: )  LLC  (MW) a firm that potentially stands to gain in the event of a decline in Eurofins' share price. To the best of Eurofins' knowledge  Muddy Waters has never participated in Eurofins investor events  nor has it ever directly engaged with Eurofins to gauge the correctness or relevance of their assumptions  hypotheses and inferences  which would have enabled the avoidance of spreading inaccurate  irrelevant or misleading information and the twisting or spinning of facts to maliciously disparage the Company and its management.Upon a first review of their claims  it is Eurofins' view that the entirety of the allegations and insinuations contained therein is either inaccurate  irrelevant  biased and/or misleading.Some of the most blatantly wrong and/or misleading allegations include:Making an unsuitable comparison between Eurofins' purchase of BioSantÃ© in Martinique to investments in travel and tourism  when actually the multiples for this acquisition were in line with the lower range in the sector and it has proven to deliver accretive margins since then.Citing some specific local GAAP requirements in how to report cash and equivalents in condensed local statutory accounts filings to build a story about potential double-counting of cash at Group level  when all these intercompany transactions are eliminated in the Consolidated financials  and cash amounts are systematically audited at both local and consolidated levels based on bank confirmations and other controls with all required communication between accounting teams and auditors.Using the post transaction address of the buyer (Eurofins) instead of the registered address of the seller and using wrong values to falsely paint the purchase of Permitted Development Investments No. 9 by Eurofins from unrelated real estate developers as a deliberate act to facilitate a markup of the property via a straw buyer.Alleging that spreadsheets are extensively used for reporting and with unacceptably loose internal controls when the Company has actually utilised for many years recognised technologies such as Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) Dynamics  Microsoft Great Plains  IBM (NYSE: ) Cognos and Coupa.(NYSE: ) Cognos and Coupa. Highlighting that the ratios of revenues per employee and cost per employee are higher than some companies active in the TIC sector  and therefore claiming that they would be too good to be true  while there are obvious geographical and type of service and sector served mix effects (i.e.  Rest of the World accounts for less than 20% of Eurofins consolidated revenues  compared to between 40% and 50% for peers cited in the report due to their much higher China exposures)  as well as fundamental differences between Eurofins and TIC activities such as:Eurofins is mostly focused on testing and not on inspection and certification (I&C) activities which require much higher labour intensity (i.e.  lower revenues per employee). Compared to I&C  Testing requires highly skilled staff and generates higher revenues per employee. Eurofins activities are much more focused (over 30%) on more scientifically advanced testing services for the biopharmaceutical sector.Most wrong and misleading allegations by MW have already been addressed at length by Eurofins in multiple disclosures following previous disparaging short sellers reports but  as always Eurofins will provide detailed refutations and facts in due course about the long list of insidious allegations in the report. Some of the MW comments refer to facts that occurred 10 to 20 years ago when Eurofins had much less access to capital and higher indebtedness relative to its profitability. It has been already widely disclosed that Eurofins would not have been able to acquire all the laboratories buildings performed by the holding of its main shareholder at that time without exceeding acceptable financial leverage ratios. Instead  it favored investing organically and inorganically in the growth of the Group at much higher returns than if these amounts had been invested in buildings. The growth of Eurofins revenues  profits and enterprise value since 2005 should provide sufficient confirmation of this but Eurofins will provide more analysis of these matters too. As previously disclosed  all real estate transactions with related parties were done at arm's length terms and of course all buildings were paid for by their owner.The Company is completely confident in the integrity of its accounts  operational performance  internal controls and risk management. It firmly stands behind the processes and reporting quality of its financial performance and corporate governance. Its structure with focussed operational companies under an empowered leader has proven well suited to success in our fields of activity where service and customer focus are important and contrary to assertions by MW  Eurofins is of the opinion that this structure provides better controls  risk management and accountability. Examples of the Company's financial resilience and strong corporate governance include:A solid cash position and balance sheet that enabled the Company to do an early redemption of a €448 Eurobond on 19 June 2024  one month ahead of its maturity date on 25 July 2024.Eurofins commissions statutory audits covering nearly 100% of its external sales  EBITDA and total assets  even when this is not required by local regulation. These are performed mostly by Tier 1 and Tier 2 audit firms.A Board-level Sustainability and Corporate Governance Committee made up exclusively of independent and non-executive directors systematically assesses the materiality of planned related party transactions and ensures they are at arm's length terms.Clear disclosures on all related party transactions are published in Annual Reports  including benchmarks with third party leases.As a Luxembourg-based and registered company  Eurofins fulfils all reporting obligations of that jurisdiction and in addition complies with relevant French AMF regulations as it has been historically listed in Paris.Eurofins has obviously shared this publication with its current lead auditors (Deloitte Audit)  as some statements or insinuations in this publication may unjustly cast doubts on their work. The company will work together with its auditors in preparing further analyses as required.Comments from the CEO  Dr Gilles Martin:Since its inception nearly 37 years ago  Eurofins has taken pride that integrity  impartiality and independence form an integral and unalienable part of our Group culture. This extends across all aspects of our business and organisation  from operations and finance to corporate governance. We have been and always will be committed to fair and clear disclosures. Thus  it appears deeply slanderous to me  and undoubtably also to our employees  bondholders  shareholders and other stakeholders  to see these baseless accusations levelled against us. We will spare no effort to ensure the truth is made clear to all. The MW report contains such blatantly false or misleading statements that at first glance it would seem to come from someone with absolutely no experience about Eurofins  its sector or its history and who has been very negligent in its research. It is troubling though to read that MW took the pain to analyse every line of 30 irrelevant local statutory accounts of small Spanish subsidiaries of Eurofins but failed to note that  just to cite some examples  the revenues per employee of Charles River laboratories (CRL) in 2023 were 50% higher than those of Eurofins  while CRL's capital expenditures to revenues ratio was also very close to that of Eurofins. As can easily be seen in a few minutes of research in Eurofins and other publicly available reports  CRL and some other contract research organisations are closer peers to Eurofins than the 3 companies cited by MW. Other similar examples to easily disprove MW's grossly false allegations of overstated revenues abound. Whether the assertions of MW are down to inexperience in our business  carelessness or wilful intent to mislead investors and other Eurofins stakeholders by knowingly spreading false assertions and insinuations remains to be analysed too.About Eurofins “ the global leader in bio-analysisEurofins is Testing for Life.

This decrease materializes in the three business sectors (casinos  hotels and others):The casinos COI at € 24.3 M (compared to € 27.0 M in the first half of 2023) is penalized by operating difficulties encountered by the numerous establishments undergoing renovation in Vichy  La Tour-de-Salvagny  Saint Amand-les-Eaux  Divonne and Casino 314 (Cannes). Furthermore  the Middelkerke casino in Belgium  which relocated to the seafront at the end of March 2024  is penalized by its heavy development works;Conversely  the COI of online gaming in Meyrin (Switzerland) and Middelkerke (Belgium)  launched since 29 th January 2024  both increased by + € 0.7 M and + € 0.4 M respectively;January 2024  both increased by + € 0.7 M and + € 0.4 M respectively; The COI of the hotels is a loss of - € 2.7 M in H1 2024 compared to - € 2.3 M in H1 2023  as well as that of the “Other” sector at - € 6.2 M compared to - € 5.4 M.Purchases and external expenses at € 72.6 M increased by € 2.0 M (+2.8%)  with particularly:an increase in advertising/marketing expenses of € 0.8 M (+5.4%) relating to the operations of Groupe Partouche 50th anniversary  between March and December 2023  and to a more offensive digital marketing in Meyrin (Switzerland) linked to its online activity;an increase in subcontracting expenses of € 0.8 M (+14.3%) due to the rise in cleaning and security expenses (+ € 0.5 M) and other expenses and;conversely  purchases of materials fell by -3.7%  mainly due to the reduction in energy expenditure amounting to € 0.7 M (-8.1%) as a result of falling prices.Employees’ expenses reached € 90.6 M  up by € 3.2 M  mainly due to an increase in the minimum wage (SMIC) as at 1st January 2024  and new conventional grids applicable from 1st April 2024.Net Income amounted to € 7.1 M  compared to € 18.8 M on 30th April 2023  taking into account the following items:a non-current operating income of – € 1.0 M compared to a profit of € 0.7 M at 30 th April 2023  resulting from the progress margin on the property development contract in La Grande Motte and from the disposal of two real estate assets in Contrexéville.

In addition  financial expenses related to IFRS 16 lease liabilities increased by € 0.5 M;A tax expense (CVAE included) of € 6.1 M compared to a tax revenue + € 0.3 M in H1 2023due to the activation of the balance of the Group’s carry forward tax losses generating differed tax income of € 3.6 M  while in H1 2024  a consumption of differed tax of - € 2.7 M was observed.With a cash flow net of levies of € 89.8 M  equity of € 367.3 and net debt of € 81.2 M (constructed in accordance with the terms of the syndicated loan contract  according to the former IAS 17 standards  excluding IFRS 16)  the Group's financial structure is sound and robust  enabling it to continue its growth investment program.The 1st half-year financial report as of 30th April 2024 is available today on the Group's website www.groupepartouche.com in the Finance section.Upcoming events:- 3rd quarter financial information: Tuesday 10th September 2024  after stock market closure- 4th quarter turnover: Tuesday 10th December 2024  after stock market closureGroupe Partouche was established in 1973 and has grown to become one of the market leaders in Europe in its business sector.

The plans will be outlined at a webinar hosted from London by Lard Friese  CEO of Aegon  and Mike Ho…,The Hague  June 25  2024 - Aegon today presents its plans to accelerate the transformation of Aegon UK into a leading digital savings and retirement platform. The plans will be outlined at a webinar hosted from London by Lard Friese  CEO of Aegon  and Mike Holliday-Williams  CEO of Aegon UK  together with other senior leaders of Aegon UK.Aegon CEO  Lard Friese  commented: “Aegon’s ambition is to create leading businesses in investment  protection  and retirement solutions. Aegon UK is well positioned to capture the opportunities of the UK’s large and growing market for long-term savings and retirement solutions. I have great confidence in our UK colleagues to deliver on our plans to transform Aegon UK into a champion business.”Aegon UK operates an interconnected business model with three growth franchises: the Workplace platform  the Adviser platform  and the Advice franchise. These three franchises serve around 2.5 million customers with GBP 104 billion of assets under administration (AuA) at the end of 2023. In addition  Aegon UK manages a portfolio of traditional pension and annuities products with 1.3 million customers  and a trading and custody platform that administers assets for institutional clients.The Workplace platform offers retirement solutions for large and medium-sized employers and already occupies a top three market position in terms of winning new business. The company plans to further increase the digitalization and automation of the Workplace platform  enhance the retirement propositions  and further personalize the customer experience. This is expected to lead to significant growth of net flows into the Workplace platform to more than GBP 5 billion per year by 2028  resulting in an increase of AuA from GBP 53 billion at the end of 2023 to more than GBP 85 billion in 2028.Aegon UK’s Adviser platform offers long-term savings and investment solutions to advisers and their customers. The company plans to focus on the 500 adviser firms that currently contribute around 70% of the Adviser platform’s gross flows. Aegon UK will invest to further enhance its proposition  while also simplifying technology and increasing automation to build on the leading online customer and adviser journeys already in place. The company aims to turn net flows of the Adviser platform positive by 2028. AuA on the Adviser platform is expected to remain stable at above GBP 50 billion through 2028.The Advice franchise offers financial planning guidance and advice to Workplace platform customers and other corporate partners  including the recently extended partnership with Nationwide  and is expected to drive net flows into the Adviser platform. By embedding the advice proposition in customer journeys  Aegon UK plans to deepen its relationship with its Workplace customers and expand to other customer segments  while also further integrating its businesses and reducing costs.The transformation will enable Aegon UK to grow the combined AuA of the three growth franchises to above GBP 135 billion by 2028 and to increase its operating capital generation by around 12% per year from a base level of approximately GBP 120 million in 2024. Aegon UK’s IFRS operating result is expected to increase to around GBP 190 million in 2028 from around GBP 165 million in 2024. Remittances to the Holding are expected to increase by around GBP 5 million per year during the transformation  starting from a base level of approximately GBP 100 million in 2024. Aegon UK will fund the transformation and the remittances out of its operating capital generation and its own funds allowing a small decrease in its UK Solvency II level. There is potential for higher remittance growth after the investment period.The webinar  which takes place today at 14:00 BST / 15:00 CEST  will be followed by an analyst Q&A.

We are excited to present data for our novel therapies that may offer benefits beyond symptom management – to safely help patients regain control of their lives without harsh side effects  residual impairments  or treatments dependent on high frequency infusions. argenx continues to build scientific and clinical evidence that supports the advancement of our innovative pipeline and shows the potential to expand therapeutic choices while reducing the risk of relapse and accumulating disability.”Phase 2 ARDA Data Support Empasiprubart as Novel Targeted Treatment for MMNFor the first time at a medical congress  argenx presented Cohort 1 data from the Phase 2 ARDA study  which support proof of concept for empasiprubart as a potential new treatment option for MMN  a chronic  progressive autoimmune disease with only one approved treatment option. ARDA is the largest interventional study to-date in MMN.Improved function and reduced risk of IVIg retreatment : Compared with placebo  treatment with empasiprubart reduced the risk of IVIg retreatment by 91% (HR: 0.09 [95% CI: 0.02–0.44])  with improvement of grip and muscle strength  and improved patients’ ability to perform daily activities.: Compared with placebo  treatment with empasiprubart reduced the risk of IVIg retreatment by 91% (HR: 0.09 [95% CI: 0.02–0.44])  with improvement of grip and muscle strength  and improved patients’ ability to perform daily activities. Favorable tolerability profile: Empasiprubart was well-tolerated and most adverse events were mild or moderate.ADHERE Oral Presentation Highlights Consistent Sustained Efficacy and Safety of VYVGART Hytrulo for Patients with CIDPargenx also presented new data from the pivotal ADHERE and open-label extension ADHERE+ studies evaluating VYVGART Hytrulo in patients with CIDP. The ADHERE data supported the recent FDA approval of VYVGART Hytrulo as a safe and effective new treatment option for CIDP  demonstrating sustained functional benefit across all disease scores regardless of disease stage or treatment history. ADHERE met its primary endpoint (p<0.0001) demonstrating a 61% reduction (HR: 0.39 95% CI: 0.25; 0.61) in the risk of relapse versus placebo. Ninety-nine percent of trial participants elected to participate in the ADHERE+ open-label extension.Sustained functional improvements: Demonstrated improvements in functional ability (mean aINCAT scores) on VYVGART Hytrulo from Stage A baseline were maintained through Stage B of ADHERE and to Week 24 of ADHERE+. Mean aINCAT scores improved from Run-in Period baseline  indicating some patients gain functional benefit on VYVGART Hytrulo compared to baseline assessments while on prior treatment.Secondary endpoints show consistent improvements across functional and strength measures : VYVGART Hytrulo-treated patients demonstrated maintenance of functional benefit in Stage B  whereas placebo patients experienced clinically meaningful worsening across all disease scores  including aINCAT  I-RODS and grip strengthHigh retention and compliance in long-term extension study : 98.9% of ADHERE+ participants demonstrated treatment compliance with VYVGART Hytrulo and 86% were still ongoing at Week 24 of the OLE.: VYVGART Hytrulo-treated patients demonstrated maintenance of functional benefit in Stage B  whereas placebo patients experienced clinically meaningful worsening across all disease scores  including aINCAT  I-RODS and grip strength Favorable safety profile: Safety profile of VYVGART Hytrulo was similar between ADHERE and ADHERE+ with no increased rate of adverse events with increased exposure.VYVGART Hytrulo was approved on June 21  2024  for the treatment of adult patients with CIDP by the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA).About Multifocal Motor NeuropathyMultifocal motor neuropathy (MMN) is a rare  chronic autoimmune disease of the peripheral nervous system. The disease is characterized by slowly progressive  asymmetric muscle weakness mainly of the hands  forearms and lower legs. MMN is often associated with the presence of anti-GM1 IgM autoantibodies  leading to activation of the classical complement pathway  driving subsequent axon damage. High-dose IVIg is the only approved treatment for MMN and patients typically experience disease progression despite therapy  indicating an unmet need for efficacious and better tolerated therapeutic options.About Chronic Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (CIDP)Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) is a rare and serious autoimmune disease of the peripheral nervous system. Although confirmation of disease pathophysiology is still emerging  there is increasing evidence that IgG antibodies play a key role in the damage to the peripheral nerves. People with CIDP experience fatigue  muscle weakness and a loss of feeling in their arms and legs that can get worse over time or may come and go. These symptoms can significantly impair a person's ability to function in their daily lives. Without treatment  one-third of people living with CIDP will need a wheelchair.Phase 2 ARDA Study DesignThe Phase 2 ARDA study is a randomized  double-blinded  placebo-controlled multicenter study to evaluate the safety and tolerability  efficacy  pharmacokinetics  pharmacodynamics  and immunogenicity of two dose regimens of empasiprubart in adults with multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN). The study consists of an IVIg dependency and monitoring period before 2:1 randomization into a double-blind treatment phase for 16-weeks. Two sequential cohorts of 27 MMN patients receiving empasiprubart or placebo were enrolled investigating two different dose levels of empasiprubart. The primary endpoint is safety and tolerability. Additional endpoints include time to IVIg retreatment  biomarker analyses of C2 levels  and changes in measurements on key clinical efficacy scores (modified medical research council (mMRC)-14 sum score  grip strength  MMN-RODS) as well as several patient-reported quality of life outcome measures.About ADHERE Trial DesignThe ADHERE trial was a multicenter  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled trial evaluating VYVGART® Hytrulo (efgartigimod alfa and hyaluronidase-qvfc) for the treatment of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). ADHERE enrolled 322 adult patients with CIDP who were treatment naïve (not on active treatment within the past six months or newly diagnosed) or being treated with immunoglobulin therapy or corticosteroids. The trial consisted of an open-label Stage A followed by a randomized  placebo-controlled Stage B. In order to be eligible for the trial  the diagnosis of CIDP was confirmed by an independent panel of experts. Patients entered a run-in stage  where any ongoing CIDP treatment was stopped and in order to be eligible for Stage A had to demonstrate active disease  with clinically meaningful worsening on at least one CIDP clinical assessment tool  including INCAT  I-RODS  or mean grip strength. Treatment naïve patients were able to skip the run-in period with proof of recent worsening. To advance to Stage B  patients needed to demonstrate evidence of clinical improvement (ECI) with VYVGART Hytrulo. ECI was achieved through improvement of the INCAT score  or improvement on I-RODS or mean grip strength if those scales had demonstrated worsening during the run-in period. In Stage B  patients were randomized to either VYVGART Hytrulo or placebo for up to 48 weeks. The primary endpoint was measured once 88 total relapses or events were achieved in Stage B and was based on the hazard ratio for the time to first adjusted INCAT deterioration (i.e. relapse). After Stage B  all patients had the option to roll-over to an open-label extension study to receive VYVGART Hytrulo.About EmpasiprubartEmpasiprubart (ARGX-117) is a first-in-class humanized monoclonal antibody that binds C2 and blocks activation of both the classical and lectin pathways of the complement cascade  leaving the alternative pathway intact for its antimicrobial properties. By blocking complement activity upstream of C3 and C5  empasiprubart has the potential to reduce tissue inflammation and cellular damage  representing a broad pipeline opportunity across multiple severe autoimmune indications.

This has been driven by companies being taken private  often in private-equity backed deals  moving listings elsewhere  and a dearth of IPO activity.READ MORESmurfit Kappa is set to leave the exchange next week as it merges with US rival WestRock and moves its main listing from London to New York. It follows on from the exit of fellow Iseq heavyweights CRH and Flutter Entertainment in the past 10 months.The submission suggests that the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) and pillar banks could participate in the cornerstone fund by highlighting other instances where State-owned fund and banks have co-invested in initiatives. These include investment firm BGF Ireland  established in 2017 to provide equity financing to Irish small and medium-sized companies  and Pearl Residential Equity Fund  established five years ago to provide equity financing for residential projects throughout the State.The paper also outlines governance structures for a cornerstone fund and investment criterial  including that it would not be the lead investor in any IPO and would take no more than 15 per cent in an individual company.The Irish Equity Market Forum has also called on the Government to launch a tax-friendly retail investment plan along the lines of the popular schemes in some other European countries  including the individual savings accounts (ISAs) scheme introduced in the UK 25 years ago.It advocated that an Irish so-called growth and returns account be launched  which would allow individuals to invest as much as €40 000 for a period of five years directly or indirectly companies listed in the European Economic Area (EEA).The Government here would be prohibited by EU state-aid rules from launching a scheme aimed at incentivising investment in stocks on the Iseq. A wider scheme focused on stocks across EEA would be of limited benefit to the Irish market.The document  filed with the department in May in advance of Budget 2025  also reiterated long-standing calls from Euronext Dublin for the introduction of tax incentives to allow company founders to sell some of their shares as part of a flotation.Neale Richmond  Minister of State for with responsibility for financial services  told The Irish Times last week that the Government is keen to help the stock exchange in Dublin “recover” from several high-profile exits and a paucity of new flotations in recent years and is examining if it can introduce tax incentives to boost activity.“The scheme [proposed by Euronext] has got quite clear merits. We’re keen to talk to them further. We want to make sure that we can help them recover ” he said.Companies listed on the Euronext Dublin contributed €12.4 billion to the domestic economy in 2022  according to a report written last year by Grant Thornton.

Salmones Camanchaca Board of Directors announced the start of the necessary processes ""to discontinue ...","Salmones Camanchaca Board of Directors announced the start of the necessary processes ""to discontinue certificates of deposit for its tradable shares on the Oslo Stock Exchange "" that is to exit Euronext Oslo. The company  which clarified that it maintains the possibility of trading its shares on the Santiago Stock Exchange  in Chile  seeks to complete the operation within 2024 and has been very clear about the reason for this change that will lead it to be listed only in Chile.In January 2018  Salmones Camanchaca decided to place 30% of its shares on the market  allocating shareholders in Oslo 25% ownership and those in Santiago the remaining 5%. However  during the past six and a half years  the Norwegian certificates - called NDRs - have been mostly sold by investors in Oslo and acquired by investors in Chile  massively reducing the NDRs and increasing the shares that do trade on the Santiago Stock Exchange. Thus  what started as 25% and 5% has now become approximately 2.9% and 26.8%.This lack of presence of Salmones Camanchaca's shares in Euronext Oslo's operations has meant that the dual listing has lost its original purpose which  as the Chilean salmon farming company explained  was to be present on the world's main stock exchange for seafood companies. The current minimal presence and profit make the costs of keeping shares listed on two markets unjustified  though.""Salmones Camanchaca made an important effort in 2018 to offer 30% of its shares in two markets  Chilean and Norwegian  as that would open doors for ample financing and access to more developed capital markets  especially in the seafood sector. However  our shares became less attractive in Norway as investors in Chile bought shares in Santiago  and thus that market reduced its liquidity "" explained Ricardo García Holtz  Vice President of Salmones Camanchaca.""We realized over the years that a dual placement makes a lot of sense when the two markets are interconnected  and property can flow freely from one to the other  with low transaction costs and quickly. Reality showed that the processes were very smooth when it came to bringing property or shares into Chile  but very difficult in the reverse transaction "" he added.""Thus  without two-way arbitrage  dual placements do not work. With less than 3% of the property traded in Oslo  and no possibility in practice of flows carrying shares from Chile to Norway  the costs of keeping the shares listed in two markets were totally unjustified "" continued García Holtz's explanation.Salmones Camanchaca's Vice President also said that ending the Oslo Stock Exchange will bring effective savings to the company  which estimates that it will also achieve it without associated costs. ""Chile is an open market that can be accessed directly  and we will maintain our presence and relevance in the financial community "" he concluded.",neutral,0.0,0.99,0.01,negative,0.0,0.09,0.91,True,English,"['Oslo Stock Exchange', 'Salmones Camanchaca', 'Ricardo García Holtz', 'Chilean salmon farming company', 'main stock exchange', 'a half years', 'developed capital markets', 'Santiago Stock Exchange', 'Oslo Stock Exchange', 'current minimal presence', 'Salmones Camanchaca Board', 'low transaction costs', 'reverse transaction', 'two markets', 'past six', 'dual listing', 'original purpose', 'seafood companies', 'important effort', 'ample financing', 'seafood sector', 'Vice President', 'dual placement', 'two-way arbitrage', 'effective savings', 'financial community', 'Euronext Oslo', 'associated costs', 'necessary processes', 'open market', 'tradable shares', 'Norwegian certificates', 'Directors', 'start', 'deposit', 'possibility', 'operation', 'reason', 'January', 'shareholders', '25% ownership', 'remaining', 'investors', 'NDRs', 'trade', 'lack', 'world', 'profit', 'doors', 'access', 'Norway', 'liquidity', 'lot', 'sense', 'property', 'Reality', 'less', 'practice', 'flows', 'explanation', 'relevance']",2024-06-26,2024-06-26,weareaquaculture.com

We believe a public listing of The London Tunnels is the logical next step  improving our ability to raise further capital over the ...,The company is the latest in a string of high-profile names to turn its back on the London Stock Exchange  in favour of other exchanges in the US and elsewhere in Europe.ADVERTISEMENTLondon Tunnels  the company aiming to convert an 8 000 square metres central London underground network of abandoned tunnels  known as the Kingsway Exchange  into a new historical attraction  has recently revealed that it would be listing in Amsterdam  instead of the UK capital.This decision comes just a few months after the company told the London Stock Exchange that it was interested in going public in London.At the time  London Tunnels’ chief executive Angus Murray highlighted that given the fundamentally British nature of the tunnels  due to a British owner  and their revival being for the good of London tourism  London Tunnels should  naturally  list on the London Stock Exchange (LSE).However  since then  the company has revealed that the decision to list in Amsterdam is so that it can take full advantage of the entire range and scale of the European capital market  an opportunity which the London Stock Exchange  in its current weakened situation  may struggle to provide. The company is expecting to raise about £30 million (€35.56 million).The Kingsway revival project is located under Holborn  in central London and is expected to be opened to the public in 2027  and could potentially see up to 2 million visitors annually.In a statement  Angus Murray said: “We are delighted to announce the upcoming listing of our shares on Euronext Amsterdam. We believe a public listing of The London Tunnels is the logical next step  improving our ability to raise further capital over the coming years to support the company’s growth strategy and create long-term value.“The London Tunnels can now take advantage of the size and scale of both the equity capital markets and debt capital markets of Europe. The listing on Euronext  Europe’s largest regulated stock exchange  is in the best long-term interests of the company  its shareholders and the future ambitions for the development of the project in central London.”Peter Curtin  chairman of The London Tunnels also said  “The listing of The London Tunnels on the leading pan-European market will give investors the opportunity to acquire shares in what is likely to be the last major historical and heritage attraction that can be reopened in central London. The Tunnels could be set to become one of London’s major tourist attractions  providing visitors with an exciting educational  cultural and heritage experience.”What does this mean for the UK stock market?The UK stock market has seen a turbulent few months  with a number of high profile companies such as Arm Holdings  Flutter Entertainment  CRH and Smurfit Kappa having announced plans to delist from the London Stock Exchange  in order to list elsewhere  mostly in the US.This  in turn  has caused considerable anxiety and turmoil amongst both institutional and retail investors  who have lost significant confidence in the UK stock market and the country’s near-term economic prospects.Now  with a company rooted so deeply in British history like London Tunnels  also choosing a foreign stock exchange  this investor anxiety could potentially get even worse. Fortunately  the LSE has also had some positive news in recent weeks in the form of companies like Raspberry Pi and Shein choosing to list in the UK.However  concerns have been expressed about Shein  its business model and its production practices.Dan Coatsworth  an investment analyst at AJ Bell said: “Theoretically  Shein listing in London should be good for the UK market and could attract other fast-growing names in e-commerce. London Stock Exchange would be shouting from the rooftops  saying it’s a real coup to get such a big name on the market.“But in a world where investors demand transparency  high levels of governance and companies to be good corporate citizens  you have to wonder whether Shein will pass all the tests with flying colours.”,neutral,0.05,0.88,0.07,mixed,0.36,0.17,0.48,True,English,"['London Tunnels', 'Amsterdam IPO', 'blow', 'City', '8,000 square metres central London underground network', 'up to 2 million visitors', 'largest regulated stock exchange', 'chief executive Angus Murray', 'The Kingsway revival project', 'foreign stock exchange', 'current weakened situation', 'logical next step', 'last major historical', 'major tourist attractions', 'exciting educational, cultural', 'near-term economic prospects', 'London Stock Exchange', 'leading pan-European market', 'new historical attraction', 'best long-term interests', 'equity capital markets', 'debt capital markets', 'other fast-growing names', 'good corporate citizens', 'UK stock market', 'European capital market', 'The London Tunnels', 'high profile companies', 'Kingsway Exchange', 'The Tunnels', 'UK market', 'UK capital', 'high-profile names', 'other exchanges', 'London tourism', 'long-term value', 'heritage attraction', 'high levels', 'British nature', 'British owner', 'entire range', 'coming years', 'growth strategy', 'future ambitions', 'Peter Curtin', 'heritage experience', 'Arm Holdings', 'Flutter Entertainment', 'Smurfit Kappa', 'considerable anxiety', 'significant confidence', 'British history', 'investor anxiety', 'positive news', 'recent weeks', 'Raspberry Pi', 'business model', 'production practices', 'Dan Coatsworth', 'investment analyst', 'AJ Bell', 'real coup', 'big name', 'flying colours', 'upcoming listing', 'full advantage', 'retail investors', 'public listing', 'Shein listing', 'Euronext Amsterdam', 'company', 'string', 'back', 'favour', 'ADVERTISEMENT', 'decision', 'time', 'LSE', 'scale', 'opportunity', 'Holborn', 'statement', 'shares', 'ability', 'size', 'shareholders', 'development', 'chairman', 'turbulent', 'months', 'number', 'CRH', 'plans', 'order', 'turn', 'turmoil', 'institutional', 'country', 'form', 'concerns', 'commerce', 'rooftops', 'world', 'transparency', 'governance', 'tests']",2024-06-26,2024-06-26,euronews.com
