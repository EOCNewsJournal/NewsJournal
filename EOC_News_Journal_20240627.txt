43228,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/06/25/g7-summit-frozen-russian-assets-ukraine-chinese-banks/,A New Era of Financial Warfare Has Begun,The West’s latest actions against Russia carry risks for the global system and could provoke China.,Washington and the West have begun a new phase of financial warfare against Russia and China—a powerful but also potentially risky escalation that  if people aren’t careful  could eventually give Moscow and Beijing exactly the outcome they are believed to be looking for.Washington and the West have begun a new phase of financial warfare against Russia and China—a powerful but also potentially risky escalation that  if people aren’t careful  could eventually give Moscow and Beijing exactly the outcome they are believed to be looking for.How so? Because the unprecedented actions taken at the G-7 summit in June to hand over to Ukraine billions of dollars in profits earned on frozen Russian assets—along with new actions taken against Chinese banks—could begin to undermine the legitimacy of the U.S.-dominated international financial system  some experts say. And that could make Russian President Vladimir Putin and especially Chinese President Xi Jinping  who is said to want to create an alternative renminbi-based financial system  very happy in the end.At a time when many nations are unsure about whether to do business with Russia and are falling into the debt-enforced embrace of China  the G-7 action sends a message: What was once sacrosanct in international finance may be no longer. A number of sovereign wealth funds  central banks  corporations  and private investors—especially from the smaller countries of the global south that are most vulnerable to sanctions—may well want to hedge against full investment in dollar- and euro-based holdings.“This decision crosses the Rubicon ” said Ryan Martínez Mitchell  a law professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong  by “weakening the norm of sovereign immunity for foreign central banks.”“Any shift away from a U.S. dollar-based global financial system is not a near-term prospect  but decisions like these do probably add to the constituency that would welcome that kind of future ” Mitchell said. Others agree. “There were many forces pushing for a search for alternatives to [the U.S.] dollar  and this move will give an additional push to those efforts ” said Harold James  a financial historian at Princeton University. “I believe we are at a tipping point in which two worries coincide: one about the likely fiscal path of the U.S. and an unsustainably large burden; the second about seizure of assets  with secondary sanctions possibly being applied to countries that are in a supply chain with China and then indirectly with Russia.”The “tipping point ” James warns  could come in the form of many countries  even U.S. allies  beginning to move their assets away from the dollar and euro. According to Raghuram Rajan of the University of Chicago  a former governor of the Reserve Bank of India  nations are disturbed by the idea that Russia’s $300 billion in central bank reserves have been inaccessible for more than two years. “Some central banks have started diversifying reserves a little more as a result  including into gold ” Rajan said.James added: “One sign that I find very telling is how Central European countries  the Czech Republic and Poland  both of which feel very close to the U.S. and who weren’t interested in gold reserves when they felt secure—indeed  the Czech Republic sold its gold reserves the day they entered NATO in March 1999—are now buying large amounts of gold.”Putin himself spoke triumphantly of this trend in his notorious interview with renegade U.S. newscaster Tucker Carlson in February. Washington’s decision “to use the dollar as a tool of the foreign-policy struggle is one of the biggest strategic mistakes made by the U.S. political leadership ” Putin said  pointing to America’s fiscal profligacy. “Even the U.S. allies are now downsizing their dollar reserves.” At another point  Putin warned other countries that they “could be next in line for expropriation by the United States and the West.”Wary of the risks of sending a destabilizing message  the G-7 did stop short of actually seizing the Russian assets at its summit in Italy. Instead  it adopted a complex scheme to transfer so-called windfall profits on earnings from frozen Russian central bank securities—the earnings of some $3 billion to $4 billion a year come from investments by Euroclear  the financial services company in Belgium that holds the Russian assets—to supply finance to Ukraine.It was unprecedented all the same. As a senior Biden administration official described it: “Never before in history has a multilateral coalition immobilized the sovereign assets of an aggressor country and then found a way to unlock the value of those assets for the benefit of the aggrieved party as it fights for its freedom. That’s what happened at this G-7.”However it’s done  making money off other nations’ assets—even aggressor nations  such as Russia  in total violation of global norms—is a risky precedent. “Once a new sanction becomes seen as effective  its usage tends to proliferate ” said Jon Bateman  a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “In recent years  creative new uses of export control powers—such as the Entity List and the Foreign Direct Product Rule—have ping-ponged between Chinese and Russian targets  with each country serving as a proving ground for actions later taken against the other.”Nor did the G-7 leaders stop there. They also indicated that new measures were being considered that might gradually cut Beijing out of the international financial system. While saying in a communiqué that they “recognize the importance of China in global trade” and affirming that they “are not trying to harm China or thwart its economic development ” the leaders obliquely threatened Chinese banks “and other entities in China” with measures to “restrict access to our financial systems.” That could ratchet up the war—and the risks to the system—dramatically.China has already been quietly insulating itself from financial retaliation over its support of Russia in the past two years  said Hung Tran  a former deputy director at the International Monetary Fund  in a June 21 interview. “The major Chinese banks have been very cautious even in reducing their exposure and dealings with Russia. In place of that  smaller institutions not having any business with any U.S. entity have been set up to handle trade with Russia so that basically Russia-China trade is settled in renminbi and rubles.”The senior administration official justified the decision to increase pressure on China by saying that “some of China’s actions to support the Russian war machine are now not just threatening Ukraine’s existence but European security and trans-Atlantic security.” The official added that among other “unrivaled policy distortions coming out of China”—meaning its unfair trade practices—Beijing was now openly supplying dual-use components and other economic aid to Russia. “There was unanimous agreement that the Russian military has been sustained by transforming its entire economy into a war machine and because China and other countries have been willing to serve” that effort  the official said.In a blunt statement during his visit to Beijing in April  Secretary of State Antony Blinken reiterated these accusations  declaring that China was “powering Russia’s brutal war of aggression against Ukraine” as “the top supplier of machine tools  microelectronics  nitrocellulose  which is critical to making munitions and rocket propellants  and other dual-use items that Moscow is using to ramp up its defense industrial base.”The actions taken at the G-7 summit may well have been necessary. Nearly two and a half years into the war  support for aid from the United States and Europe is flagging  Kyiv’s forces are exhausted  Russia’s economy is still looking fairly robust  and a new anti-Western alignment is hardening between Moscow  Beijing  Tehran  and most recently North Korea. “We are stepping up our collective efforts to disarm and defund Russia’s military industrial complex ” the G-7 leaders said in their communiqué.This latest approach to squeezing Russia started slowly  even painfully  amid a great deal of tension between the United States and European governments about just how tough to get with Moscow. Immediately following Putin’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022  none of those governments had a problem imposing the usual economic sanctions—import and export restrictions and the like—and quickly. They took a major step further when they froze Russia’s central bank assets—an unprecedented move against such a large country—in addition to real estate properties  stocks  bonds  and various investments held by Russian oligarchs.But actually seizing those bank assets was seen as a step too far  especially by the Europeans  who fought off an effort led by the U.S. Congress  and ultimately backed by the Biden administration  to pursue full seizure. That meant tampering with the international financial system itself—the complex postwar network of norms  codes  and laws that has underwritten the greatest surge of prosperity in recorded history and enriched the West. That felt a little too much like playing with elemental fire because it meant threatening the idea of sovereign immunity that is central to the system and because it meant posing increased risks to the holding of dollar- and euro-denominated assets. And having established this precedent  what about China? What effect will the G-7’s warnings have on Xi?The shot fired in the communiqué could deter Xi from doing even more to isolate China’s ailing economy than he already has—specifically by invading or blockading Taiwan. Or  alternatively  it could mean the beginning of the end of the postwar global economic system if Xi decides to move against Taiwan anyway. Indeed  he could easily gamble that the United States wouldn’t dare do to China what it’s doing to Russia for exactly that reason.If the United States and West were to respond to an invasion or blockade of Taiwan by freezing and leveraging Chinese assets  the result could be a freeze-up of the whole financial system and a devastating blow to the global economy. In the case of Russia  Washington needed to undergo many months of negotiation with the European Union because the vast majority of Russian assets are held in Europe and there was only about $300 billion or so to freeze. The same is not true of Chinese assets  which are huge and spread all over the world. Under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act  Washington would be able to freeze some $800 billion in Chinese Treasury bill holdings entirely on its own  which is only a portion of some $3 trillion in Chinese-owned sovereign assets overseas. But Beijing could easily retaliate against that nearly $6 trillion in Western investment in China.As Tran argues  the threat of a kind of financial MAD  or mutual assured destruction  is far too great. In “terms of balance sheet exposures  China has about $3.4 trillion of identifiable international assets at risk of possible sanctions and up to $5.8 trillion of liabilities to  or assets in China of  international investors and companies largely from Western countries. China therefore has plenty of room to take retaliatory actions ” Tran wrote in a 2022 post for the Atlantic Council titled “Wargaming a Western Freeze of China’s Foreign Reserves.”The deep cross-integration between China and the West is what has led both sides to avoid a complete decoupling of economies  reflecting what former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers once called a “financial balance of terror.” As a result  “there will be more resistance to imposing the scope of sanctions we have imposed on Russia because Western economies are far more intertwined with China’s than they were with Russia’s ” said William Reinsch  a former U.S. commerce undersecretary now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.Reinsch notes there is an important “qualitative difference” as well: “The Russian assets being used are those seized from oligarchs who have supported/enabled Putin. There are some Chinese oligarchs  but their relationship with their own government is much different  as is their role in the economy. If you go beyond oligarchs  you get very quickly to seizing sovereign assets  which I doubt the West would do and for which the consequences would be significant.”But according to some China experts  the latest moves might only spur Xi to further decouple his economy. The “dimmer” that peaceful reunification with Taiwan seems  “the more incentives Beijing would have to reduce vulnerabilities to sanctions in case of a militarized conflict ” said Zongyuan Zoe Liu  a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and columnist for Foreign Policy. “China has been diversifying its foreign exchange reserves since the 2000s. While previously the primary motivation was to search for higher returns and strategic assets  now it is also to reduce vulnerabilities to sanctions.”And while Xi’s dream of a renminbi-based system still “has a long way to go”—the yuan is a distant fifth in global reserve currency holdings—escalating Western moves “may ultimately weaken international law protections for everyone  not only their intended targets ” Mitchell wrote recently for the Quincy Institute. As a result  “intensified weaponization of Western currencies could indeed boost China’s yuan efforts  and  more significantly  provide a major stimulus to plans for a BRICS basket reserve currency. The move would simultaneously improve Beijing’s reputation as an apparently more responsible actor with respect to foreign assets  while also perversely incentivizing it to further experiment with its own nascent unilateral sanctions regime.”Russia is much more willing than China to blow up the international system. But that doesn’t mean Xi won’t decide he can afford to see that happen as well. As Tran argues  Beijing has been pursuing a “dual-track” strategy of working within the current Western-led trading system “but also wanting to find alternative ways to do this trade without being exposed to dollar sanctions.” Further sanctions could only push Xi further in the radical direction of trying to set up an alternative renminbi-based financial trading system.“Both sides are kind of upping their ante ” Tran said.,neutral,0.01,0.82,0.17,mixed,0.13,0.24,0.63,True,English,"['New Era', 'Financial Warfare', 'renegade U.S. newscaster Tucker Carlson', 'U.S.-dominated international financial system', 'U.S. dollar-based global financial system', 'alternative renminbi-based financial system', 'U.S. political leadership', 'senior Biden administration official', 'Chinese President Xi Jinping', 'Ryan Martínez Mitchell', 'Russian central bank securities', 'Russian President Vladimir Putin', 'U.S. allies', 'financial services company', 'U.S.] dollar', 'biggest strategic mistakes', 'likely fiscal path', 'sovereign wealth funds', 'foreign central banks', 'frozen Russian assets', 'central bank reserves', 'Central European countries', 'other nations’ assets', 'financial warfare', 'financial historian', 'global south', 'global norms', 'International Peace', 'Reserve Bank', 'senior fellow', 'Chinese banks', 'international finance', 'fiscal profligacy', 'other countries', 'sovereign immunity', 'Chinese University', 'sovereign assets', 'new phase', 'risky escalation', 'unprecedented actions', 'new actions', 'many nations', 'debt-enforced embrace', 'private investors', 'smaller countries', 'full investment', 'euro-based holdings', 'law professor', 'Hong Kong', 'near-term prospect', 'many forces', 'additional push', 'two worries', 'large burden', 'supply chain', 'many countries', 'former governor', 'two years', 'One sign', 'Czech Republic', 'large amounts', 'notorious interview', 'foreign-policy struggle', 'United States', 'complex scheme', 'multilateral coalition', 'aggressor country', 'aggrieved party', 'aggressor nations', 'total violation', 'risky precedent', 'new sanction', 'Jon Bateman', 'Carnegie Endowment', 'recent years', 'dollar reserves', 'Princeton University', 'tipping point', 'G-7 action', 'secondary sanctions', 'Raghuram Rajan', 'gold reserves', 'destabilizing message', 'windfall profits', 'Harold James', 'G-7 summit', 'Washington', 'West', 'China', 'powerful', 'people', 'Moscow', 'Beijing', 'outcome', 'June', 'Ukraine', 'billions', 'dollars', 'legitimacy', 'experts', 'time', 'business', 'number', 'corporations', 'decision', 'Rubicon', 'constituency', 'kind', 'future', 'Others', 'search', 'alternatives', 'move', 'efforts', 'seizure', 'Chicago', 'India', 'idea', 'result', 'Poland', 'NATO', 'March', 'trend', 'February', 'tool', 'America', 'line', 'expropriation', 'risks', 'Italy', 'earnings', 'investments', 'Euroclear', 'Belgium', 'history', 'way', 'value', 'benefit', 'freedom', 'money', 'usage']",2024-06-25,2024-06-27,foreignpolicy.com

43230,Deutsche Boerse,NewsApi.org,https://oilprice.com/Energy/Energy-General/German-Industry-Vulnerable-to-Chinese-Retaliation.html,German Industry Vulnerable to Chinese Retaliation,After several weeks of escalating tit-for-tat trade war salvos between China and Europe  threatening to scuttle billions in auto trade between the two blocs  over the weekend China agreed to enter talks with the EU over its decision to impose higher tariffs o…,"After several weeks of escalating tit-for-tat trade war salvos between China and Europe  threatening to scuttle billions in auto trade between the two blocs  over the weekend China agreed to enter talks with the EU over its decision to impose higher tariffs on imports of Chinese electric vehicles during a visit to Beijing by Germany’s vice-chancellor  which was aimed at soothing tensions.Robert Habeck  Germany's minister for economic affairs and climate action  the same minister who was crucified by Deutsche Boerse CEO Theodor Weimer in his recent rant  welcomed the move by China to enter discussions with Brussels on EU tariffs but said it was “a first step and many more will be necessary”.His comments came after China’s ministry of commerce said Beijing and Brussels had agreed to launch consultations on an anti-subsidy investigation launched by the EU last year. The probe led to a decision this month to increase tariffs on Chinese EVs to as high as 48%  which in turn provoked China's anger and threats to retaliate in kind on Europe's internal combustion cars. The announcement followed a video conference between China’s minister of commerce Wang Wentao and EU executive vice-president and trade commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis.As previously reported  Germany - whose economy has been in peril for the past 2 years caught by the double whammy of soaring energy prices and shrinking Chinese imports of German goods - has been critical of the EU’s decision to increase tariffs on imports of Chinese EVs and Habeck is the first senior European politician to visit the country since the extra duties were announced.The Chinese market is crucially important for Germany’s vast carmaking industry  making Berlin particularly vulnerable to any retaliatory measures by Beijing  which has already announced its own anti-dumping investigation into EU pork products.While he struck a conciliatory tone on tariffs  which are yet to be finalized  Habeck was also critical of China’s growing exports to Russia and cited Germany’s efforts to stop exports of “dual-use” goods with potential military applications.“I looked at the trade figures and Chinese trade with Russia increased more than 40% last year ” he said. “Of course energy is a high part [of] it  but something like half of it is related to dual-use goods. These are technically goods that can be used on the battlefield and this has to stop.""Spoiler alert: it won't stop since Germany needs Chinese buyers more than China needs to placate Germany. China is one of Germany’s largest trading partners and Berlin has sought to carefully navigate rising tensions between Beijing and Washington that increased sharply following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in 2022.According to the FT  Habeck also visited Beijing where he met Wang Wentao and Zheng Shenjie  head of the National Development and Reform Commission. He said they spoke about energy and climate issues as well as human rights with Chinese officials as part of “intense discussions”.However  as DW reports  a planned meeting with Premier Li Qiang did not materialize with Premier Li Qiang was cancelled at the last minute without explanation  in a clear snub at Germany.On Sunday  the German vice-chancellor said China should find a safe alternative to coal after the country ramped up production of the carbon-intensive fuel source. “Without China it would not be possible to meet the climate targets globally ” he said during a visit to Hangzhou  according to a Reuters report.While Joe Biden imposed tariffs of 100 per cent on Chinese electric vehicles this year  higher than the EU  though the US imports much smaller volumes.Olaf Scholz  Germany’s chancellor  met President Xi Jinping in April and encouraged China’s president to pressure Russia to end its campaign in Ukraine. Absolutely nothing came out of that  which is understandable since Scholz also petitioned Li for greater market access for German companies in the mainland. Perhaps someone should explain to Germany that when you are begging for concessions  you can't also be demanding conditions.ADVERTISEMENTMeanwhile  Xi and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin have trumpeted their close relationship and sworn to increase trade. Russia became China’s fifth-biggest single-country trading partner last year  up from ninth in 2020  as trade reached $240bn. Chinese exports to Russia rose 46.9 per cent in 2023 year on year  according to official data. Much  if not all of this increase in trade between China and Russia  has come at the expense of the increasingly spineless and irrelevant Germany.By Zerohedge.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:",neutral,0.01,0.89,0.1,negative,0.01,0.23,0.75,True,English,"['German Industry', 'Chinese Retaliation', 'Deutsche Boerse CEO Theodor Weimer', 'biggest single-country trading partner', 'first senior European politician', 'tat trade war salvos', 'largest trading partners', 'internal combustion cars', 'vast carmaking industry', 'potential military applications', 'carbon-intensive fuel source', 'greater market access', 'Premier Li Qiang', 'Chinese electric vehicles', 'EU executive vice-president', 'EU pork products', 'soaring energy prices', 'President Xi Jinping', 'first step', 'Chinese market', 'Chinese EVs', 'Chinese buyers', 'Chinese officials', 'Chinese trade', 'several weeks', 'two blocs', 'economic affairs', 'climate action', 'recent rant', 'anti-subsidy investigation', 'video conference', 'Wang Wentao', 'Valdis Dombrovskis', 'past 2 years', 'double whammy', 'extra duties', 'retaliatory measures', 'anti-dumping investigation', 'conciliatory tone', 'Spoiler alert', 'Zheng Shenjie', 'National Development', 'Reform Commission', 'climate issues', 'human rights', 'DW reports', 'planned meeting', 'last minute', 'clear snub', 'safe alternative', 'climate targets', 'Reuters report', 'Joe Biden', '100 per cent', 'smaller volumes', 'German companies', 'demanding conditions', 'Russian counterpart', 'Vladimir Putin', 'close relationship', 'official data', 'Top Reads', 'auto trade', 'trade commissioner', 'trade figures', 'Chinese exports', 'German goods', 'dual-use” goods', 'dual-use goods', 'growing exports', 'Chinese imports', 'high part', 'rising tensions', 'intense discussions', 'German vice-chancellor', 'Olaf Scholz', 'higher tariffs', 'same minister', 'Robert Habeck', 'irrelevant Germany', 'EU tariffs', 'tit', 'China', 'billions', 'weekend', 'talks', 'decision', 'visit', 'Beijing', 'move', 'Brussels', 'comments', 'ministry', 'commerce', 'consultations', 'probe', 'turn', 'anger', 'threats', 'kind', 'announcement', 'economy', 'peril', 'shrinking', 'Berlin', 'efforts', 'something', 'half', 'battlefield', 'Washington', 'invasion', 'Ukraine', 'FT', 'head', 'explanation', 'Sunday', 'coal', 'production', 'Hangzhou', 'April', 'campaign', 'mainland', 'someone', 'concessions', 'ADVERTISEMENT', 'increase', 'expense', 'spineless', 'Zerohedge', 'More', 'Oilprice', '2023']",2024-06-26,2024-06-27,oilprice.com

This site is more particularly dedicated to the e-commerce business and to the home delivery to individual customers all over the metropolitan area of Montpellier  comprising more than 500 000 inhabitants.Located along the A9 French highway  which links Béziers to Nîmes  the Castries site grants delivery access to the heart of Montpellier in 15 minutes and to the rest of the cities part of this metropolitan area in less than an hour.The building has two halls dedicated to receiving and storing goods  as well as to preparing and to shipping orders. The multi-temperature site can handle the combination of a full range of products  from ambient temperature to goods at freezing (-25°C) or positive cold (2°C) atmosphere as well as fruits and vegetables (8°C). A block of offices of 500 sq.m is also part of this site.Artificialisation reversal  renaturation and site turnaround: the key words of the projectThe environmental aspect of the project was at the heart of ARGAN’s considerations.The building was thus constructed on an impermeabilized site of 9 000 sq.m  which was until now dedicated to outdoor storage of building materials.This operation that was developed by ADIM Occitanie – the subsidiary for real estate development of VINCI Construction – resulted in the artificialisation reversal of 3 000 sq.m of land surface in order to use it for water storage basins covering 2 750 sq.m and green spaces where 23 trees as well as many shrubs were planted to bring nature back to this site.This project is also part of a site turnaround approach: ADIM Occitanie and Sogea Sud Bâtiment – another VINCI Construction subsidiary that conducted the works – have put a special emphasis on reusing the parts of the previously deconstructed building to carry out the project. In total  36.7 tons of CO 2 equivalent were saved thanks to the recycling of the metallic roof framework  concrete retaining walls and finishing materials  as part of a partnership with the “MAS Réemploi association”(a centre that recycles building materials in Montpellier).2024 financial calendar (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)July 1: Net sales of 2 nd quarter 2024quarter 2024 July 24: Half-year results 2024October 1: Net sales of 3rd quarter 20242025 financial calendar (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)January 3: Net sales of 4 th quarter 2024quarter 2024 January 16: Annual results 2024March 20: General Assembly 2025About ARGANARGAN is the only French real estate company specializing in the DEVELOPMENT & RENTAL OF PREMIUM WAREHOUSES listed on EURONEXT and is the leading player of its market.

Status epilepticus is defined as a seizure lasting more than 5 minutes.RAMPART unequivocally raised IM midazolam to the status of standard-of-care in the pre-hospital emergency management of status epilepticus by demonstrating its non-inferiority vs. IV lorazepam  as its primary endpoint. Moreover  IM midazolam demonstrated statistically significant superiority (p value<0.001) on the percentage of patients arriving in hospital seizure-free  which was 10% higher when using IM midazolam (329 out of 448 patients or 73.4% vs. 63.4% in the IV lorazepam 445-patient arm). These results underscored the importance of the speed of IM administration of midazolam  as an easy to store and pre-prepared medication for use by paramedics  features that were likely critical in driving efficacy in controlling seizures by the time of arrival in emergency departments. RAMPART was one of the largest studies every conducted in emergency settings  involving 4 314 paramedics  33 EMS (Emergency Medical Services) units and 79 hospital ER (Emergency Room) departments across the U.S. It was supported by the National Institute of Health (NIH) and by the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA). The RAMPART study publication can be found here.Crossject’s study  recently published in the peer-reviewed journal Neurology and Therapy  positively echoed the benefits implied from RAMPART and is remarkably consistent with certain hints put forward by the authors in the RAMPART study. In Crossject’s study  ZEPIZURE® was equivalent to the IM injection from a syringe equipped with a 30mm needle (Dormicum®)  and results also suggested a 2-fold lower variability as compared to that usually observed for routes of administration such as intranasal.With some vision and based on their experience then  RAMPART authors had highlighted a number of issues regarding intranasal solutions in epileptic seizures in general  and their prediction of the likely dominance of the IM route for the future. Today  no intranasal solution is approved for the management of status epilepticus. According to RAMPART’s authors  the upfront minutes were critical factors in driving the 10% superiority of IM midazolam  administered through traditional manual vial-form injectable  in positive clinical outcome by ER arrival. ZEPIZURE®  as an ultra-rapid two-step injection  strongly resonates in this practical interventional reality and is likely to further improve the speed of action by healthcare professionals and reliability in injecting a full dose of midazolam. Furthermore  in Crossject’s study  ZEPIZURE® enhanced the midazolam absorption during the very first few minutes post-injection  possibly resulting from the needle-free 50 milliseconds injection compared to manual IM and suggesting that seizure treatment may be efficient even sooner.Patrick Alexandre  CEO of Crossject added: “Beyond the 505(b)(2) regulatory and market gate for ZEPIZURE® into the arsenal available to healthcare professionals in status epilepticus episodes  as potentially the most rapid-to-use and lowest variability tool for the delivery of a complete midazolam dose pre-hospital  our product presents additional upside. ZEPIZURE®’s rapid and easy two-step application should potentially require limited training compared to traditional injectables  and its consistency in administering an effective dose would confer a key advantage. ZEPIZURE® is therefore poised to provide all patients  and their relatives or caregivers  with the professional standard-of-pre-hospital-care solution anytime and anywhere. Our team in Europe and the U.S. is now executing our development strategy to materialize these broad prospects  aiming to position ZEPIZURE® from a productivity contribution to healthcare professionals toward a high impact solution for all patients and families at risk of a broad range of epilepsy seizures.”About CrossjectCrossject SA (Euronext: ALCJ; www.crossject.com ) is an emerging specialty pharmaceuticals company developing medicines for emergency situations harnessing its award-winning needle-free auto-injector ZENEO® platform.

Spineway was a Bronze Sponsor of the event  where the Group presented its ESP (cervical and lumbar) prostheses through demonstrations and scientific papers  highlighting the growing interest in cervical and lumbar prostheses in this historic region for the Group.This annual congress attracts surgeons from many Asian countries and has allowed Spineway to consolidate its presence  particularly in Hong Kong  where it has been marketing ESP disc prostheses for over seven years.As an extension of this event and in addition to the scientific presentations  SMISS  in collaboration with the CUHK (Chinese University of Hong Kong)  organized hands-on training sessions at the Orthopaedic Learning Centre anatomy laboratory of the Prince of Wales Hospital on June 16-24. During these practical training sessions  Spineway organized two workshops dedicated to training surgeons in total disc replacement  one with its cervical prostheses (CP-ESP)  led by Dr. Philip Cheung (Matilda International Hospital)  and the other with its lumbar prostheses (LP-ESP)  led by Dr. Raymond Yip (Matilda International Hospital).These courses  which are very popular with surgeons  allow professionals to perform surgeries to discover or perfect surgical techniques. This hands-on workshop was held in Hong Kong and was attended by approximately 20 Asian surgeons.

The long-term outlook (2030 objectives) will also be reviewed.NHOA will keep the market informed of the results of this analysis  in particular in the context of the intention of TCC Group Holdings Co.

43260,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.irishtimes.com/business/2024/06/26/irish-stock-market-group-seeks-state-backing-for-400m-ipo-fund/,Irish stock market group seeks State backing for €400m IPO fund,Dublin market now at ‘critical juncture’ warn officials involved in Irish equity market,The Government should back the establishment of a €400 million cornerstone fund to invest in Irish initial public offerings (IPOs)  a group of officials involved in Irish equity markets said in a pre-budget submission.“Over the past decade  for a variety of reasons  Irish equity capital markets have underperformed and remain underutilised as a funding mechanism for scaling Irish companies ” the so-called Irish Equity Market Forum  comprised of officials from the Euronext Dublin stock exchange and corporate law  accountancy and stockbroking firms  said in its submission.“We are now at a critical juncture  and urgent action is required by the Irish Government and all domestic stakeholders – exchange  brokers  lawyers  accountants  registrars and central securities depositories – to change the trajectory and re-establish public equity markets as a viable and long-term funding avenue for Irish companies.”The submission fleshes out headline proposals from the Euronext-led group that were previously reported by The Irish Times earlier this month  as it seeks to reboot a market that has seen the number of company listings decline by 40 per cent in the past decade to 26 today. This has been driven by companies being taken private  often in private-equity backed deals  moving listings elsewhere  and a dearth of IPO activity.READ MORESmurfit Kappa is set to leave the exchange next week as it merges with US rival WestRock and moves its main listing from London to New York. It follows on from the exit of fellow Iseq heavyweights CRH and Flutter Entertainment in the past 10 months.The submission suggests that the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) and pillar banks could participate in the cornerstone fund by highlighting other instances where State-owned fund and banks have co-invested in initiatives. These include investment firm BGF Ireland  established in 2017 to provide equity financing to Irish small and medium-sized companies  and Pearl Residential Equity Fund  established five years ago to provide equity financing for residential projects throughout the State.The paper also outlines governance structures for a cornerstone fund and investment criterial  including that it would not be the lead investor in any IPO and would take no more than 15 per cent in an individual company.The Irish Equity Market Forum has also called on the Government to launch a tax-friendly retail investment plan along the lines of the popular schemes in some other European countries  including the individual savings accounts (ISAs) scheme introduced in the UK 25 years ago.It advocated that an Irish so-called growth and returns account be launched  which would allow individuals to invest as much as €40 000 for a period of five years directly or indirectly companies listed in the European Economic Area (EEA).The Government here would be prohibited by EU state-aid rules from launching a scheme aimed at incentivising investment in stocks on the Iseq. A wider scheme focused on stocks across EEA would be of limited benefit to the Irish market.The document  filed with the department in May in advance of Budget 2025  also reiterated long-standing calls from Euronext Dublin for the introduction of tax incentives to allow company founders to sell some of their shares as part of a flotation.Neale Richmond  Minister of State for with responsibility for financial services  told The Irish Times last week that the Government is keen to help the stock exchange in Dublin “recover” from several high-profile exits and a paucity of new flotations in recent years and is examining if it can introduce tax incentives to boost activity.“The scheme [proposed by Euronext] has got quite clear merits. We’re keen to talk to them further. We want to make sure that we can help them recover ” he said.Companies listed on the Euronext Dublin contributed €12.4 billion to the domestic economy in 2022  according to a report written last year by Grant Thornton.

By integrating cutting-edge science with practical clinical applications  we are about to revolutionize how millions of patients manage their food-related Irritable Bowel Syndrome and their overall health. Our commitment to leveraging AI and data analytics could not only enhance patient outcomes but also provide invaluable insights to the broader nutrition and pharmaceutical industries. We are excited to embark on this journey and look forward to forming strategic partnerships that will help us rapidly expand our reach and impact  said Sacha Loiseau  Chairman and CEO of Mauna Kea Technologies.A significant unmet medical need affecting 1 in 10 peopleMore than 50 million patients2 suffer from food intolerances associated with IBS in the U.S. and Europe “ nearly 1 person in 10 “ and more than half of them could suffer from atypical food allergies  which can be difficult to identify and treat. In a recent large-scale survey3  64% of IBS patients reported suffering for more than 10 years  and 33% described their symptoms as completely out of control. Current treatments frequently fail to provide relief  leaving a substantial portion of this population with ongoing discomfort and health issues.Strong clinical science and real-world evidence of CellTolerance™ proven to reduce symptoms in 96% of patients4CellTolerance™ is a unique program designed with physicians and dietitians to detect and treat food intolerances through personalized dietary monitoring  live cell-response visualization via intestinal barrier microscopic response to selected foods and supervised elimination diets. It is rooted in more than a decade of research and peer-reviewed publications  including new data presented at the Digestive Disease Week ® (DDW) 2024 Conference held in Washington  DC.As part of a baseline medical workup for IBS  patients are asked to respond to a standardized IBS-symptom severity score (IBS-SSS). In one abstract presented at DDW5 researchers found that patients who underwent a CellTolerance-guided food elimination diet saw a significant reduction in their IBS-SSS compared to the pre-test baseline (p = 0.04). More interestingly  patients saw a significant worsening of symptoms when that particular food was reintroduced (p = 0.04)  underscoring the positive impact of identifying the correct food with an accurate test like CellTolerance™. In a separate oral presentation at DDW6  CellTolerance™ was presented as a viable screening tool to detect food intolerances in patients who have previously tested negative for IgE-mediated food allergies or celiac disease but continue to have suspected food-related IBS symptoms. Thanks to dedicated and visionary physicians  hundreds of patients have already experienced a CellTolerance-guided elimination diet and 96% have reported improvement of their symptoms  higher than the difficult-to-implement low-FODMAP diet7.A new company dedicated to digital health and AI solutionsTo best develop the CellTolerance™ program  a new wholly owned subsidiary will soon be incorporated (CellTolerance)  with the prospect of eventually operating as an independent  lean company with specific agreements  ensuring the availability of the Cellvizio technology platform as a key component of the CellTolerance™ program.CellTolerance will also aim at providing patients  providers and partners with innovative digital tools to monitor patients and collect a vast quantity of real world and clinical data. This unique multi-scale dataset (endoscopy  endomicroscopy  clinical data  etc.) will be leveraged to develop advanced AI models offering unprecedented clinical insights. These insights could empower pharmaceutical and nutrition companies to tailor personalized treatments  optimize nutritional plans  and predict individual responses to therapies and dietary interventions.By integrating comprehensive data analytics and AI  CellTolerance aims to transform healthcare delivery and nutrition management  ultimately enhancing patient outcomes and advancing medical research.It is also envisioned that CellTolerance will quickly open its capital to venture capital funds specializing in nutrition  wellness  microbiome  gut health and related activities to fund the development of its program independently.A market opportunity estimated at $1.5 billion8 to be addressed through strategic partnershipsThe CellTolerance™ program is intended to be launched at scale in key markets such as the United States  France  Germany  Italy and Switzerland. The addressable market in these countries is highly significant  representing an opportunity estimated at $1.5 billion. To best capitalize on this opportunity and maximize the reach of its program  CellTolerance intends to form strategic partnerships with clinic networks which see the program as a unique opportunity to expand their service offerings.By working closely with networks of clinics  CellTolerance will ensure continuous training and ongoing support for healthcare professionals  enabling optimal use of its technologies. This strategy aims to establish CellTolerance™ as the reference solution for identifying and treating food intolerances while reducing marketing costs through partners' marketing infrastructures.About Digestive Disease Week ®Digestive Disease Week ® (DDW) is the largest international gathering of physicians  researchers and academics in the fields of gastroenterology  hepatology  endoscopy and gastrointestinal surgery.

In addition  following the decision to progressively restart product shipments and production of APIs in Brindisi  the company provides revised full-year 2024 guidance.Operational roadmapRevealed in February 2024 following a comprehensive analysis of the company’s operational strengths and weaknesses  FOCUS-27 is a 4-year plan that aims to improve competitiveness and unlock sustainable and profitable growth by refocusing on high-value and growing market segments.It is built on four pillars:A streamlined value-added portfolio focused on highly differentiated profitable APIs  particularly Peptides and Oligonucleotides  Prostaglandins  Corticosteroids  Hormones  Vitamin B12  and Opiates. Thirteen APIs will be discontinued in 2026 and 2027. These APIs accounted for approximately 80 million euros in net sales and weighted approximately - 15 million euros on gross margin in 2023. The share of highly differentiated APIs should reach more than 70% of EUROAPI sales in 2027  compared to 57% in 2023 .focused on highly differentiated profitable APIs  particularly Peptides and Oligonucleotides  Prostaglandins  Corticosteroids  Hormones  Vitamin B12  and Opiates.

Haverhill (UK) and Brindisi (Italy) manufacturing sites are planned to be divested before the end of the plan. The group has already received expressions of interest. The potential costs of these divestitures  estimated as of today  are embedded in the current financing of the plan.EUROAPI plans to invest 350 to 400 M€ in CAPEX throughout the plan to pave the way for future growth. These CAPEX will be focused on strategic initiatives  includingincreased capacities for Large Molecules in Frankfurt  for Vitamin B12 in Elbeuf and for Prostaglandins in Budapestnew capabilities for Corticosteroids  Hormones  and Opiates in Vertolayea steam generation biomass boiler in Elbeuf to reduce CO2 emissions and achieve EUROAPI’s 2030 decarbonation planApproximately 59% of total CAPEX will be dedicated to growth or performance.A streamlined organization supporting a more efficient and leaner operating model.

Restructuring costs are estimated in the range of 110 to 120 M€ between 2024 and 2027 (excluding the potential costs related to the divestment of Haverhill and Brindisi  estimated as of today  which are embedded in the current financing of the plan).Short and long-term financingThe implementation of FOCUS-27 will be funded by a combination of financial resources.With the support of the company's mandataire ad hoc  EUROAPI is in advanced discussions with its banks to amend the terms and extend the duration of the 451 M€ Revolving Credit Facility signed in 2022 7 .. Upon the completion of these discussions  Sanofi has agreed to support the financing of FOCUS-27 through a 200 M€ Perpetual Subordinated Hybrid Bond. On any interest payment date  and subject to certain conditions  EUROAPI may decide to defer the interest payment related to this bond. This non-dilutive hybrid instrument will be classified as “Equity” in the consolidated financial statements.On any interest payment date  and subject to certain conditions  EUROAPI may decide to defer the interest payment related to this bond.
