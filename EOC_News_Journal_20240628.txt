Despite this  the bank's dividends have shown volatility over the past eight years  indicating some level of unpredictability in its payments. Recent strategic expansions into Germany through acquisitions  such as Hauck Aufhaeuser Lampe for €672 million and potential acquisition of HSBC's German private bank  are set to increase assets under management significantly  which could impact future financial stability and dividend policies.ENXTAM:ABN Dividend History as at Jun 2024Simply Wall St Dividend Rating: ★★★★☆☆Overview: Koninklijke KPN N.V. operates as a telecommunications and IT service provider in the Netherlands  with a market capitalization of approximately €13.95 billion.Operations: Koninklijke KPN N.V. generates revenue through three primary segments: Business (€1.84 billion)  Consumer (€2.93 billion)  and Wholesale (€0.70 billion).Dividend Yield: 4.2%Koninklijke KPN's recent strategic moves  including a €498.41 million fixed-income offering and the creation of TowerCo with Dutch pension fund ABP  underscore its efforts to enhance infrastructure and shareholder value. Despite these initiatives  KPN's dividend yield of 4.23% trails behind top Dutch dividend payers. The company maintains a payout ratio of 78.4%  supported by earnings and cash flows (cash payout ratio: 59.6%)  yet its dividend history shows instability over the past decade  reflecting some risk in consistency of returns to shareholders.Story continuesENXTAM:KPN Dividend History as at Jun 2024Simply Wall St Dividend Rating: ★★★★☆☆Overview: Signify N.V. operates globally  offering a range of lighting products  systems  and services across Europe  the Americas  and other regions  with a market capitalization of approximately €2.92 billion.Operations: Signify N.V. generates revenue from its conventional segment  totaling €0.56 billion.Dividend Yield: 6.7%Signify's recent share buyback  completed for €11.9 million  aligns with its strategy to manage share dilution from employee incentive plans. Despite a robust dividend yield of 6.7%  among the top 25% in the Dutch market  Signify's dividend history is marked by volatility over its 7-year payout period. Financially  Q1 sales dropped to €1.47 billion from €1.68 billion year-on-year  but net income improved to €44 million from €25 million  reflecting some resilience amidst challenges.ENXTAM:LIGHT Dividend History as at Jun 2024Seize The OpportunityAccess the full spectrum of 6 Top Euronext Amsterdam Dividend Stocks by clicking on this link.Already own these companies?

Almost 8 months after having unveiled its new ESG strategy  ARGAN recorded first significant results and is confirming its ambitions for 2030.A clear reduction in CO 2 emissions linked to energy consumption: the 26.5% decrease in gas consumption recorded in 2023 contributed  overall  to a 14.5% reduction in emissions coming from the part of Scope 3 that is linked to the use of the warehouses. Note that the target set for 2030 as part of our low carbon strategy is a decrease of –50%. Overall  ARGAN’s 2023 carbon footprint showed a 33.5% decrease from 2022. These first encouraging results reflect the impact of policies for frugal use of energy that have been put in place by ARGAN’s client-tenants  of the implementation of BMS devices that help precisely monitor energy flows and the systematic deployment of Aut0nom®  the “Net Zero” in-use warehouse. In 2024  the effective launch of the Heat Pumps Plan  which aims at replacing gas boilers in the existing portfolio with electric heat pumps  will further carry the decrease of “in-use” emissions; An accelerating Social / Societal policy: Our Group also pursued its initiatives in favour of long-term commitment from its employees  as the first free shares for all employees were created   while maintaining an attractive compensation structure (collective commercial bonuses and profit sharing) and an equity ratio of 2.4   which is a particularity amongst companies part of the SBF 120 French index;contributed  overall  to a 14.5% reduction in emissions coming from the part of Scope 3 that is linked to the use of the warehouses. Note that the target set for 2030 as part of our low carbon strategy is a decrease of –50%. Overall  ARGAN’s 2023 carbon footprint showed a 33.5% decrease from 2022. These first encouraging results reflect the impact of policies for frugal use of energy that have been put in place by ARGAN’s client-tenants  of the implementation of BMS devices that help precisely monitor energy flows and the systematic deployment of Aut0nom®  the “Net Zero” in-use warehouse. In 2024  the effective launch of the Heat Pumps Plan  which aims at replacing gas boilers in the existing portfolio with electric heat pumps  will further carry the decrease of “in-use” emissions; An ongoing strengthening of the ESG governance framework: ARGAN has also undertaken significant work in formalizing best practices by drafting and disseminating a set of charters (anti-corruption  ethics  IT & personal data  and stock market code of conduct)  while specifying its organization regarding the development and monitoring of its ESG policy (Supervisory Board  Audit  risks and sustainability Committee  Executive Board  and monthly ESG-Energy monitoring committee).These efforts have already been recognized by independent third parties. ARGAN has improved its ESG risk rating from 'moderate' to 'low' by Sustainalytics and has been awarded a silver medal by Ethifinance.Beyond presenting the initial progress made  the 2024 report details the upcoming steps in the deployment of the 2023-2030 roadmap and very concretely expresses ARGAN’s ambition to build excellent  responsible  and sustainable logistics real estate.The 2024 ESG report published today is available on our argan.fr website under “ESG commitments” (in English and French).2024 financial calendar (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)July 1: Net sales of 2 nd quarter 2024quarter 2024 July 24: Half-year results 2024October 1: Net sales of 3rd quarter 20242025 financial calendar (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)January 3: Net sales of 4 th quarter 2024quarter 2024 January 16: Annual results 2024March 20: General Assembly 2025About ARGANARGAN is the only French real estate company specializing in the DEVELOPMENT & RENTAL OF PREMIUM WAREHOUSES listed on EURONEXT and is the leading player of its market.

It was built in 2020 and is rated BREEAM In-Use ˜Good'. It consists of three units  currently fully leased to GXO and Rhenus.A 37 800 sq m newly-built logistics warehouse in Heerlen in the De Beitel industrial estate. It was acquired from VolkerWessels & Vestum and is rated BREEAM ˜Excellent'. It is currently leased to B&R Premium Logistics B.V.  a third-party logistics company specialising in the soft drinks industry.A 36 500 sq m logistics warehouse in the Vossenberg industrial estate  Tilburg  which was acquired from abrdn. The warehouse was built in 2018 and is rated BREEAM ˜Very Good'. It is currently leased to Tesla (NASDAQ: )  which is an existing customer of SEGRO in both the Netherlands and Germany.The assets currently generate approximately €10 million of headline rent  which will almost double the headline rent attributed to SEGRO's portfolio (at share) in The Netherlands. They also offer a significant amount of reversionary potential  the majority of which is expected to be realised over the next four years  as well as the potential to increase rental values through improvements in the sustainability features of the Tilburg and Eindhoven assets  in line with the Responsible SEGRO commitment to Champion low-carbon growth.The blended topped-up net initial yield of these assets on acquisitions is 4.6 per cent and the equivalent yield is 5.8 per cent.Eelco Ouwerkerk  Head of the Netherlands at SEGRO  said:These warehouses are in some of the most attractive and supply-constrained industrial and logistics markets in The Netherlands. The acquisitions are a very positive step forward in the delivery of our plan to build scale in this important region  adding three high quality assets with reversionary potential and significantly increasing the size of our Dutch portfolio.Marco Simonetti  Managing Director  Continental Europe at SEGRO  said:We have been able to leverage our market-leading operating platform and strong local networks to create these opportunities and profitably deploy some of the capital raised in our recent equity placing  at a time when investment markets show signs of stabilisation and the supply of new sustainable warehousing remains constrained.About SEGROSEGRO is a UK Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT)  listed on the London Stock Exchange and Euronext Paris  and is a leading owner  manager and developer of modern warehouses and industrial property. It owns or manages 10.4 million square metres of space (112 million square feet) valued at £20.7 billion at 31 December 2023  serving customers from a wide range of industry sectors.

The new combined technology will be commercialized under the Bio-2-GlycolsTM trademark.Wei Cai  Chief Technology Officer  of Technip Energies commented: “We are pleased to have completed this agreement which allows us to propose an optimized  combined solution to make bio-MEG  a common feedstock for various everyday life applications. We are confident about rapidly commercializing our Bio-2-GlycolsTM technology. Our objective is to offer this technology in 2025 which will contribute significantly to the net zero challenge.”Elise H. Nowee  President of Shell Catalysts & Technologies commented: “We're excited to announce this agreement with Technip Energies  combining our respective technologies to enhance and accelerate the commercialization of Bio-2-Glycols™. By integrating Technip Energies’ expertise with our own development work on Bio-2-Glycols  we're poised to expedite the deployment of sustainable alternatives to fossil-based feedstocks  driving innovation  and together  paving a way for a more efficient and sustainable solution in this area.”About Technip EnergiesTechnip Energies is a leading Engineering & Technology company for the energy transition  with leadership positions in LNG  hydrogen and ethylene as well as growing market positions in blue and green hydrogen  sustainable chemistry and CO 2 management.

CARBIOS   (Euronext Growth Paris : ALCRB)  a pioneer in the development and industrialization of biological technologies to reinvent the life cycle of plastic and textiles  and Zhink Group  one of China’s Top 500 Private Enterprises  specializing in two global industries  PET and textiles  announce today the signing of a joint Letter of Intent to build a biorecycling plant in China using CARBIOS’ revolutionary enzymatic depolymerization technology to serve the global market. This agreement officializes collaboration towards a long-term partnership in view of a first licensing contract to build a plant with a minimum annual processing capacity of 50k tons of prepared PET waste and would contribute to accelerating a circular economy for plastic and textiles. China  as the leading producer of PET in the world  is a key market for CARBIOS  and this agreement would establish a presence in this dominant market.China: the world’s largest PET producerWith 67 million tons of PET produced annually  representing 61% of global production1  China is the world's largest PET producer. With regional and global demand for recycled PET growing  China also has the potential to take the lead in recycled PET (r-PET) production. In 2021  58% of the world’s r-PET was consumed in Asia (with 38% in China2) underscoring this region’s importance both as a major producer and consumer.Furthermore  China is a key transformer of PET into resins and fibers used in numerous applications in the packaging and textile industries. Most notably  China is the primary country for transforming PET into fiber  representing 78% of all PET fiber transformation in the world3.Sustainability and the “dual carbon” policies are considered as main drivers for the Chinese PET recycling industry. Click here to refer to the Government Guidelines to establish a waste recycling system.4Strategic partnership for Zhink and CARBIOSFor Zhink  the strategic focus is on the development of two global industries  PET and textiles  and to be a leader with sustainable competitiveness. Zhink is a major actor within the PET market with an annual production of 3 million tons of PET  serving domestic and global markets. CARBIOS has developed a revolutionary enzymatic depolymerization technology that enables efficient and solvent-free recycling of PET plastic and textile waste into virgin-like products. The initial agreement between the two groups would allow Zhink to increase its recycled PET capacities and meet its sustainable competitiveness objectives by offering r-PET from enzymatic recycling: a circular recycling solution that can process all types of PET waste including hard-to-recycle waste (such as opaque and colored bottles  multilayer food trays and textile waste) while reducing CO 2 emissions by 57%5 compared with virgin PET production. For CARBIOS  this agreement marks a significant step in the deployment of its technology worldwide and roll-out of its licensing model to achieve its ambition to become a leading technology provider in the recycling of PET by 2035. This Asia-based plant under license by Zhink would come in addition to the world’s first industrial-scale enzymatic PET recycling plant which is currently under construction in Longlaville  France.A milestone for CARBIOS’ China market entryThe opening of official discussions with Zhink for a licensing agreement marks an important milestone in CARBIOS’ market entry into China. Since its inception  CARBIOS has proactively protected its innovations in all key regions of interest. With China considered as a major market  all of CARBIOS’ families of patents6 own one or more titles in this country. For its PET biorecycling technology  CARBIOS currently has 28 titles in force in China covering both the industrial process and the enzymes used (including variants that will be used in the industrial process).Emmanuel Ladent  CEO  CARBIOS: “There is great momentum in China to accelerate the circular economy and meet its target of carbon neutrality by 2060. The technology developed by CARBIOS makes perfect sense in this context: capable of recycling all types of PET waste  it promotes a circular economy with high-quality products and significantly reduces the carbon footprint of industries. As a leader in PET production  Zhink is considered as a key partner for introducing our technology into China and will stimulate our international deployment.”Zhu Guoyang  President  Zhink Group: “For Zhink  the strategic focus is on the development of two global industries  PET and textiles  and to be a leader in the industry with sustainable competitiveness. We are actively promoting our subsidiaries to develop our PET recycling portfolio and are very interested in CARBIOS’ revolutionary biorecycling technology to reduce carbon emissions.”Tina Sejersgård Fanø  Executive Vice President  Planetary Health Biosolutions  Novonesis): “With a 20-year presence in China and a solid R&D and manufacturing footprint in the region  Novonesis is keen to share its local know-how for the successful implementation of CARBIOS. Novonesis has a strong long-term partnership with CARBIOS  and an exclusive one for the production of its patented enzymes for PET biorecycling plants under license. We are ready to meet CARBIOS’ needs for future licensing projects in the region and beyond.”###About CARBIOS:CARBIOS is a biotech company developing and industrializing biological solutions to reinvent the life cycle of plastic and textiles.
