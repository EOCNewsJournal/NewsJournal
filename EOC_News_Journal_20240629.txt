EU f…,"EU okays transfer of $1.5B to Ukraine drawn from frozen Russian assetsFor the first time  European Union foreign ministers have approved the transfer of approximately €1.4 billion ($1.5 billion) in military and financial aid to Kyiv. This aid will be funded by interest profits drawn from frozen Russian central bank assets.EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell announced the approval on Monday  coinciding with reports that Washington is preparing to send Ukraine another arms package worth $150 million. The EU also imposed a raft of sanctions on Russia  along with entities in China  Turkey and India. (Related: G7 planning to escalate war by using frozen Russian assets to give billions more to Ukraine.)The EU's decision comes amid escalating tensions following Kyiv's long-range missile strikes into Crimea over the weekend.Russia accused Ukrainian forces of using U.S.-supplied Army Tactical Missile Systems (ATACMS) with a range of nearly 200 miles and satellite imagery for the attack  which resulted in at least four deaths and over 100 injuries.In response  Russia's Foreign Ministry declared that Washington ""has effectively become a party"" to the war and threatened ""retaliatory measures.""Budapest has been vetoing further funding of Kyiv's war effort through an off-budget fund known as the European Peace Facility (EPF) worth €6 billion ($6.4 billion) for almost a year. Another fund holding €5 billion ($5.3 billion) is also blocked.Borrell acknowledged this ""structural difficulty"" during a press conference following the foreign ministers' meeting in Luxembourg.Using interest profits from seized Russian assets was seen as a viable alternative. Such measures mark an unprecedented escalation in the economic war against Russia.Human knowledge is under attack!

Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto condemned the move  stating it violated EU rules.Approximately 90 percent of the aid will be allocated for weapons to support Kyiv's war  while 10 percent will go toward direct financial aid.EU diplomats indicated that Berlin and Prague would first use the proceeds to send Ukraine more air defenses and artillery shells. The European Commission reported freezing roughly €210 billion ($224.5) in Russian central bank funds.Between the U.S. and Europe  about $280 billion in Russian assets have been seized.Euroclear  a Brussels-based financial institution  holds the majority of European-held assets and claims to have extracted €4.4 billion ($4.7 billion) in interest profits last year.Additionally  the ministers announced new sanctions against Russia  including asset freezes and travel bans on 69 individuals and 47 entities linked to the Kremlin's invasion.Organizations based in China  Turkey and India were also hit with an EU export ban over accusations of supporting Moscow’s war effort.Following a nine-month grace period  the Zeebrugge port in Belgium will be banned from exporting Russian liquefied natural gas to countries outside the EU. The bloc is also targeting 27 vessels allegedly part of Russia's ""shadow fleet"" used to transport crude oil and circumvent Western economic penalties.Despite the sanctions  Moscow became the top crude supplier to India and China during the first year of the war.Follow RussiaReport.news for more stories about the continuing conflict between Russia and Ukraine.Watch this video of former President Donald Trump threatening to end American aid to Ukraine if he wins in November.This video is from the Vampire Slayer channel on Brighteon.com.More related stories:EU and G7 nations to seize profits from frozen Russian assets and give them to corrupt Ukraine.This is how Russia can get its stolen money back while leaving the financial West to collapse all on its own.Hungary hops off ""NATO Train "" calls West's escalation of war in Ukraine ""hopeless.""Sources include:News.Antiwar.comBrighteon.com",neutral,0.02,0.89,0.09,negative,0.0,0.24,0.76,True,English,"['frozen Russian assets', 'EU', 'transfer', 'Ukraine', 'NaturalNews', 'U.S.-supplied Army Tactical Missile Systems', 'decentralized, blockchain-based, uncensorable free speech platform', 'EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell', 'Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto', 'free, downloadable generative AI tools', 'former President Donald Trump', 'Russian central bank funds', 'Russian liquefied natural gas', 'European Union foreign ministers', 'Russian central bank assets', 'South China Morning Post', '$50 billion frozen Russian funds', 'long-range missile strikes', ""foreign ministers' meeting"", 'European Peace Facility', 'The European Commission', 'nine-month grace period', 'Vampire Slayer channel', 'frozen Russian assets', 'Brussels-based financial institution', 'Western economic penalties', 'top crude supplier', 'EU export ban', 'direct financial aid', 'Foreign Ministry', 'frozen assets', 'EU funds', 'natural immunity', 'AI technology', 'Brighteon.AI', 'European-held assets', 'crude oil', 'first time', 'arms package', 'escalating tensions', 'Ukrainian forces', 'satellite imagery', 'four deaths', 'retaliatory measures', 'structural difficulty', 'press conference', 'viable alternative', 'Such measures', 'Human knowledge', 'powerful corporations', 'knowledge base', 'food production', 'human freedom', 'Brighteon.io', 'HealthRangerStore.com', 'GMO foods', 'nutritional solutions', 'legal analysis', 'decision-making process', 'EU rules', 'EU diplomats', 'air defenses', 'artillery shells', 'asset freezes', 'travel bans', 'Zeebrugge port', 'shadow fleet', 'continuing conflict', 'Brighteon.com', 'financial West', 'NATO Train', 'economic war', 'new aid', 'American aid', 'interest profits', 'G7 leaders', 'G7 nations', 'budget fund', 'unprecedented escalation', 'RussiaReport.news', 'related stories', 'war effort', 'new sanctions', 'first year', 'transfer', 'Ukraine', 'military', 'Kyiv', 'approval', 'Monday', 'reports', 'Washington', 'raft', 'entities', 'Turkey', 'India', 'billions', 'Crimea', 'weekend', 'ATACMS', '200 miles', 'attack', '100 injuries', 'response', 'party', 'Budapest', 'funding', 'EPF', 'Luxembourg', 'Governments', 'censorship', 'humanity', 'herbs', 'self-reliance', 'preparedness', 'infrastructure', 'efforts', 'shopping', 'Hungary', 'veto', 'move', '90 percent', 'weapons', '10 percent', 'Berlin', 'Prague', 'proceeds', 'Euroclear', 'majority', '69 individuals', 'Kremlin', 'invasion', 'Organizations', 'accusations', 'Moscow', 'Belgium', 'countries', '27 vessels', 'video', 'November', 'money', 'Sources', 'Antiwar']",2024-06-28,2024-06-29,naturalnews.com

An initial 1.4 billion euros ($1.5 billion) will be available in July  and another 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) will follow by the end of the year. Ninety percent of the earnings will be spent on weaponry and 10 percent on construction projects in Ukraine.Fighting against the common requirement for unity between its members  the EU ignored Hungary's veto by using a legal ""loophole"" in the rules.""New billions for Ukraine  this time by kicking up the European rules and leaving out Hungary "" Hungarian Foreign Affairs Minister Peter Szijjarto remarked. He denounced the ""shameless breach of common European rules "" emphasizing in a social media post that the move to seize frozen Russian assets is ""a clear red line.""Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said in an interview with Sputnik News in late February that any actions with Russian frozen assets would cause an equal response. He added that a comparable quantity of foreign assets has been frozen in Russia.Maria Zakharova  spokeswoman for the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs  recently said in a media briefing that Russia could take a broad range of actions to answer the Group of Seven's decision to finance Ukraine using earnings from frozen Russian assets. After the beginning of the Russian special military operation in Ukraine  the EU and G7 countries froze nearly $300 billion in Russian assets. About $207 billion is held at Euroclear  a clearinghouse based in Belgium.

According to international relations expert Krissada Promvek of Ramkhamhaeng University in Thailand  the West's seizure of frozen Russian assets will lead to the de-dollarization of the global economy.""Seizing Russia's financial reserves will lead to de-dollarization and collapse of the Old World Order "" he said. ""The Russia-Ukraine armed conflict has made it clear that the U.S. and its allies are trying to destroy Russia. The international community [in the short-term] will become more conflicted and divided between the Old World Order led by the USA and the New World Order led by Russia and China.""International relations and Russian affairs analyst Gilbert Doctorow denounced the EU's decision as ""shameful"" in an interview with Sputnik News. He explained that this will result in a sharp reduction of the use of the euro as a reserve currency in the Global South  as all of the nations there "" fear the kind of arbitrary and illegal confiscation of their national wealth by European governments whenever it suits their purposes.""Doctorow also singled out the EPF: ""It is totally hypocritical to assign to a 'peace facility' the role of financing arms and war. The ultimate goal of this 'peace initiative' is to prolong the war  at least till after the American elections in November for the sake of [U.S. President Joe] Biden's personal ambitions.""London-based foreign affairs analyst Adriel Kasonta likewise denounced Brussels' action as ""bad in every aspect.""""First of all  it is illegal if we take into account the violation of the principle of sovereign immunity of the sovereign country  which is the Russian Federation. It exposes the Western double standard when it comes to the rule of law and the application of the rules to the countries equally "" he told Sputnik News.

Furthermore  the amendment was implemented early enough and while the study was blinded  removing any methodological issues.Objection concerning the treatment of missing data in the primary analysis: Multiple sensitivity analysis of the primary analysis; using non LOCF (Last Observation Carried Forward) methods for imputation of missing data  are positive and consistent  including two analyses previously recommended by the CHMP  demonstrating the robustness of the primary analysis  thus resolving the objection concerning the treatment of missing data.Objection on the subgroup data: There was an important imbalance in a subset of patients experiencing complete loss of function (i.e.  ALSFRS-R score of zero) in one or more of the item scores (20% in the masitinib arm versus 8% in the placebo arm)  because ALSFRS-R score was minimized but not stratified by category of severity. The subgroup defined as patients prior to any complete loss of function (i.e. excluding the overmentioned biased subset) accounted for 86% of the population and showed extremely compelling results  including a significant 12 months survival benefit. The subgroup analysis is the strict application of EMA guidance (EMA/CHMP/539146/2013)  which is applicable to post hoc analysis and to registration with single pivotal study  thus resolving the objection regarding subgroup data.About AB ScienceFounded in 2001  AB Science is a pharmaceutical company specializing in the research  development and commercialization of protein kinase inhibitors (PKIs)  a class of targeted proteins whose action are key in signaling pathways within cells.

43340,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/28/french-election-le-pens-far-right-national-rally-election-gains.html,France's far right looks headed for victory in the first round at the polls. Here's what that means,With just days to go until France's snap parliamentary election kicks off  victory for the far right looks increasingly likely in the first phase of the two-stage runoff.,"Jordan Bardella  President of the National Rally (Rassemblement National)  a French nationalist and right-wing populist party  speaks to over 5 000 supporters at his final rally ahead of the upcoming European Parliament election on June 9th  at Le Dôme de Paris - Palais des Sports  on June 2  2024.  France  on June 2  2024  in Paris  France. Nurphoto | Getty ImagesWith just days to go until France's snap parliamentary election kicks off  victory for the far right looks increasingly likely in the first phase of the two-stage runoff. Marine Le Pen's National Rally and its allies are seen winning 36% of votes  signaling growing support for the party's euroskeptic  anti-immigration agenda  according to the latest opinion polls from Elabe released ahead of the first vote on June 30. The left-wing New Popular Front  meanwhile  is projected behind with 27%  while President Emmanuel Macron's Renaissance party is predicted to clinch 20% of the support  as of June 27. The shift away from centrist politics has spooked investors and analysts  who warn of implications ranging from ""political paralysis"" to ""immediate financial crisis."" But predicting the outcome of France's final vote on July 7 is less clear cut  given the complexity of France's voting system. CNBC takes a look at the likelihood of a far-right French victory and the impact for markets.A complex systemUnder France's two-stage voting system  all parliamentary candidates who receive at least 12.5% of locally registered voters progress to the second-round runoff — a feat that the National Rally is likely to achieve in a large number of constituencies. But even with sweeping gains in the first round  the party could be stumped at the final hurdle by voters using ""le vote utile"" — or tactical voting — to keep them out. That was seen as part of Macron's gamble when the French leader called the surprise vote following the National Rally's record 31.3% gain in this month's European Parliament elections. Others say the president hopes to discredit his competitors ahead of France's 2027 presidential election  with Macron since claiming there will be ""civil war"" if either extreme wins. Voter turnout for the national election is also expected to be larger — and therefore more representative — than the 51% who cast their ballot in the EU vote. With that in mind  analysts see a 30% to 40% chance of the National Rally winning the 289 seats needed to secure an absolute majority in the 577-seat National Assembly. A more likely outcome  however  would be major gains for the far right  with the National Rally potentially becoming the biggest party in France  but ultimately falling short of a majority and leading to a highly divided hung parliament.Market turmoilSuch a stalemate could leave France with lower trend growth  elevated yield spreads and a ""worse reputation globally "" Holger Schmieding  chief economist at Berenberg Bank  told CNBC on Monday. Already  France's blue-chip CAC 40 index is heading for its worst month since May 2023  having lost as much as 6% since the vote was announced on June 9. The spread between French and German borrowing costs — a key indicator of French political risk — has also jumped to its widest in more than a decade. A majority government for either the far-right or the ultra-left alliance  meanwhile  could spark a far more dramatic outcome.watch now""Spendthrift agendas"" from either party — whose policies both include lowering the retirement age and cutting income tax — could result in an ""immediate financial crisis "" Schmieding suggested. Citi analysts said in a note Thursday that markets were currently ""too optimistic"" about a benign outcome  adding that its higher probability scenarios of gridlock or an extreme parliament could lead to a 5% to 20% fall in French equity valuations. ""Combined with our finding that French equities tend to be more volatile than peers' around elections  this could be reason to expect additional choppiness from here "" the analysts noted.Political paralysisThe CEO of Paris-based Euronext  Europe's biggest stock exchange group  sought to quell investor concerns earlier this week  telling the Financial Times that neither the left nor the right would be able to implement their more extreme policies amid checks and balances from the president  ratings agencies and the European Union. On Monday  Jordan Bardella — Le Pen's 28-year-old protege  who could become prime minister under a strong showing for the National Rally — was seen stepping back on some more extreme measures  vowing to implement ""reasonable"" spending plans. That includes an aim to bring France's deficit back to the EU limit of 3% of GDP. Even with more measured fiscal plans  however  parliamentary gridlock could make such policies difficult to enact. Bardella  for his part  has recently stressed that he would ""need an absolute majority to govern "" in a bid to boost his backing. ""You start with deficit at 5.5%  debt at 110%  you're unable to do anything for the next three years  which means that deficits are just not coming down. To me that's the biggest issue that France faces right now "" Jefferies' chief financial economist for Europe  Mohit Kumar  told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Tuesday.",neutral,0.08,0.91,0.01,mixed,0.12,0.33,0.54,True,English,"['first round', 'France', 'victory', 'polls', 'Le Dôme de Paris', 'left-wing New Popular Front', 'biggest stock exchange group', 'upcoming European Parliament election', 'Palais des Sports', 'euroskeptic, anti-immigration agenda', 'latest opinion polls', 'lower trend growth', 'elevated yield spreads', 'blue-chip CAC 40 index', 'German borrowing costs', 'higher probability scenarios', 'next three years', 'Marine Le Pen', 'immediate financial crisis', 'reasonable"" spending plans', 'French equity valuations', '577-seat National Assembly', 'snap parliamentary election', 'right-wing populist party', 'French political risk', 'European Parliament elections', 'two-stage voting system', 'President Emmanuel Macron', 'right French victory', 'European Union', 'national election', '2027 presidential election', 'biggest party', 'Financial Times', 'two-stage runoff', 'extreme parliament', 'fiscal plans', 'political paralysis', 'complex system', 'parliamentary candidates', 'tactical voting', 'French nationalist', 'French leader', 'French equities', 'National Rally', 'Rassemblement National', 'final rally', 'Getty Images', 'first phase', 'centrist politics', 'clear cut', 'second-round runoff', 'large number', 'sweeping gains', 'first round', 'final hurdle', 'record 31.3% gain', 'civil war', 'extreme wins', 'Voter turnout', '30% to 40% chance', 'major gains', 'Market turmoil', 'worse reputation', 'chief economist', 'Berenberg Bank', 'key indicator', 'a decade', 'ultra-left alliance', 'Spendthrift agendas', 'retirement age', 'income tax', '5% to 20% fall', 'additional choppiness', 'Paris-based Euronext', 'investor concerns', 'ratings agencies', '28-year-old protege', 'prime minister', 'strong showing', 'extreme measures', 'EU limit', 'parliamentary gridlock', 'absolute majority', 'likely outcome', 'majority government', 'dramatic outcome', 'benign outcome', 'Jordan Bardella', 'Renaissance party', 'far right', 'first vote', 'final vote', 'EU vote', 'growing support', 'Holger Schmieding', 'worst month', 'extreme policies', 'Citi analysts', 'June 9th', '5,000 supporters', 'France', 'Nurphoto', 'days', 'allies', 'votes', 'Elabe', 'The', 'shift', 'investors', 'implications', 'July', 'less', 'complexity', 'CNBC', 'look', 'likelihood', 'impact', 'markets', 'locally', 'voters', 'feat', 'constituencies', 'utile', 'gamble', 'surprise', 'competitors', 'ballot', 'mind', '289 seats', 'hung', 'stalemate', 'Monday', 'May', 'note', 'finding', 'peers', 'CEO', 'checks', 'balances', 'aim', 'deficit', 'GDP', 'bid', 'backing', 'debt']",2024-06-28,2024-06-29,cnbc.com
