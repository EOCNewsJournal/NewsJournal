India didn't cave in  but ensured its bonds made it to the JPMorgan index,We all are gung-ho about India’s inclusion in the JPMorgan Emerging Market Bond Index  and rightfully so. This is our ‘1994 moment’  when Indian equity debuted on the MSCI Emerging Market Index.A large bond market like India should have been part of the JPMorgan index much earlier  but the Western world's biases prevented it. Representations for India’s inclusion started more than a decade ago—the initiative being taken by the then Union finance minister.Subsequent to a regime change at the Centre  the representations continued. But JPMorgan had certain ‘conditions’  or at least expectations  for including Indian government bonds in its widely tracked index.One was that there should not be any ceiling on how much foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) could invest in Indian bonds. Another expectation was for favourable tax treatment over domestic investors. JPMorgan also wanted Indian government bonds to be part of the Euroclear system  for operational familiarity.The Indian government hasn't accepted any of these conditions. No favourable tax treatment has been granted to FPIs. This is justified as the fiscal deficit is funded by domestic investors  and FPIs  for a small piece of the pie  need not be given any favourable treatment.The context of inclusion in Euroclear can be debated  but our domestic operational and settlement systems are robust  and FPIs should not have any issue.The issue of the ceiling on FPI investments was managed differently. While the overall ceiling for FPIs remains  certain government securities (G-Secs) have been designated under ‘Fully Accessible Route’ (FAR). In these particular G-Secs  FPIs can invest without any limit.A no-concessions victoryThere was a to-and-fro happening on whether India should grant these conditions. Then came a game-changer. The Russia-Ukraine war began in February 2022. Western nations imposed sanctions on Russia  the US forfeited its money  and Russia was dropped from bond indices as Western nations would not invest in the country.There was a need for another country to fill the spot. And India fit the bill.There are three bond indices in the context of this discussion. Indian government bonds were included in the JPMorgan emerging markets index on 28 June  and India’s weight in it will move up to 10% by March 2025.India will be included in the Bloomberg index in January 2025  but the number of global funds following this index is relatively lower. The other one is the FTSE Russell  but it does not currently include Indian government bonds.The JPMorgan index inclusion is a moral victory for India because no concession was granted on favourable tax treatment or listing of Indian government bonds at a foreign exchange or clearing system.The index providers had these conditions or expectations  but now we know they are flexible. The FAR route is a roundabout way of managing the issue of a ceiling for FPI investments.An attractive marketFor investments in Indian government bonds  or corporate bonds  the yield levels are attractive. The 10-year yield on Indian government securities is about 7%. Among developed nations  the 10-year yield on US securities is about 4.35%  and on German bonds about 2.49%. But among emerging  or comparable  markets  India fares better. The 10-year yield on South African securities is 10.2%  on Indonesia's is 7.17%  and on Brazil is 12.3%.These are more-or-less the only comparable markets. Turkiye or Pakistan government bonds offer higher yields  but these countries are not comparable to India as their risk levels are higher.FPIs consider not only the bond yield levels but also the currency hedging cost. While India's currency does weaken against the US dollar  it is relatively stable  and the pace of depreciation is slower than earlier. The currency hedging cost is also lower than earlier.From investors’ perspective  India's global standing is better than earlier. In equities  in the MSCI EM index  India's weight has improved to 18.3%  while China's has dropped to 25.4%.To be sure  Indian markets are domestic-driven. Foreign flows are relevant  but not a game-changer.Joydeep Sen is a corporate trainer (financial markets) and author.,positive,0.84,0.15,0.01,mixed,0.36,0.26,0.38,True,English,"['JPMorgan bond index', 'moral victory', 'India', 'inclusion', 'JPMorgan Emerging Market Bond Index', 'MSCI Emerging Market Index', 'JPMorgan emerging markets index', 'The JPMorgan index inclusion', 'large bond market', 'MSCI EM index', 'Union finance minister', 'Fully Accessible Route', 'three bond indices', 'favourable tax treatment', 'South African securities', 'Pakistan government bonds', 'currency hedging cost', 'Indian government bonds', 'Indian government securities', 'bond yield levels', 'The FAR route', 'foreign portfolio investors', 'favourable treatment', 'attractive market', 'Indian bonds', 'Indian markets', 'Bloomberg index', 'index providers', 'corporate bonds', 'German bonds', 'Indian equity', 'comparable, markets', 'comparable markets', 'financial markets', 'foreign exchange', 'risk levels', 'Foreign flows', 'domestic investors', 'investors’ perspective', '10-year yield', 'US securities', 'Western world', 'regime change', 'operational familiarity', 'fiscal deficit', 'small piece', 'domestic operational', 'settlement systems', 'concessions victory', 'Russia-Ukraine war', 'Western nations', 'global funds', 'other one', 'FTSE Russell', 'moral victory', 'clearing system', 'roundabout way', 'developed nations', 'higher yields', 'global standing', 'Joydeep Sen', 'corporate trainer', 'FPI investments', 'US dollar', 'Euroclear system', 'particular G-Secs', 'overall ceiling', '1994 moment', 'biases', 'Representations', 'initiative', 'Centre', 'conditions', 'expectations', 'FPIs', 'context', 'issue', 'limit', 'game-changer', 'February', 'sanctions', 'money', 'country', 'need', 'spot', 'bill', 'discussion', '28 June', 'weight', 'March', 'January', 'number', 'listing', 'Indonesia', 'Brazil', 'Turkiye', 'countries', 'pace', 'depreciation', 'equities', 'China', 'author']",2024-06-30,2024-07-01,livemint.com

The issuances took place in the context of the ECB trials aimed at exploring the potential of DLT for settling wholesale transactions in central bank money.The processes entirely run on Deutsche Börse’s D7 DLT. This includes both the transaction of the security itself and the transfer of funds using digital central bank money - from issuance via distribution and settlement to full lifecycle management. DekaBank acted as issuer  DZ Bank as investor - with swapped roles in the second case. Clearstream acted as DLT Market Operator  providing the technical infrastructure with its digital securities platform D7 developed in strategic partnership with Google Cloud. By connecting D7 with the Bundesbank Trigger Solution  the bond settlement is seamlessly reflected in the European TARGET2 payment system.The transactions mark the first institutional-grade issuances in Germany on DLT using wholesale digital central bank money. Issuing securities on DLT increases transparency and automation  which reduces the need for manual intervention. Additionally  using central bank money provides enhanced safety  liquidity and monetary policy alignment for issuers and investors alike.“The use case impresses with the simplicity of issuing a security with DLT technology and at the same time benefiting from the advantages of the Trigger Solution. The delivery versus payment of the Trigger Solution proves how the issuing and settlement processes of private blockchains and wholesale CBDC will interact in future. As issuer  banks benefit from the speed  scalability and security of the new technology ” said Silvio Lenk  Head of Treasury at DekaBank.“To explore the potential of digital assets  you have to take care of the whole lifecycle - from issuance via dvp settlement to maturity including the utilisation of central bank money. Participating in the ECB trials with strong partners like Deutsche Börse Group and DekaBank  we are delighted to get valuable insights on our way to higher efficiency ” Dr. Holger Meffert  Head of Securities Services & Digital Custody at DZ Bank  pointed out.Jens Hachmeister  Head of Issuer Services & New Digital Markets at Clearstream  said: “With the next-generation digital post-trade platform D7 Clearstream aims to digitise the entire post-trade value chain. With our new D7 DLT  launched for the ECB trials  we provide seamless processing of digital assets and high-quality cash on-chain  which is an important step in developing a digital European securities landscape. This transaction represents a significant milestone for the creation of stable digital capital markets in Germany and Europe  demonstrating the power of digital solutions in enhancing safety  liquidity and efficiency.”The ECB trials are conducted in a productive environment  using real central bank money.

The issuances took place in the context of the ECB trials aimed at exploring the potential of DLT for settling wholesale transactions in central bank money.,Source: ClearstreamClearstream  DekaBank and DZ Bank have jointly issued two tokenised €5-million bonds using distributed-ledger technology (DLT). The issuances took place in the context of the ECB trials aimed at exploring the potential of DLT for settling wholesale transactions in central bank money.The processes entirely run on Deutsche Börse’s D7 DLT. This includes both the transaction of the security itself and the transfer of funds using digital central bank money - from issuance via distribution and settlement to full lifecycle management. DekaBank acted as issuer  DZ Bank as investor - with swapped roles in the second case. Clearstream acted as DLT Market Operator  providing the technical infrastructure with its digital securities platform D7 developed in strategic partnership with Google Cloud. By connecting D7 with the Bundesbank Trigger Solution  the bond settlement is seamlessly reflected in the European TARGET2 payment system.The transactions mark the first institutional-grade issuances in Germany on DLT using wholesale digital central bank money. Issuing securities on DLT increases transparency and automation  which reduces the need for manual intervention. Additionally  using central bank money provides enhanced safety  liquidity and monetary policy alignment for issuers and investors alike.“The use case impresses with the simplicity of issuing a security with DLT technology and at the same time benefiting from the advantages of the Trigger Solution. The delivery versus payment of the Trigger Solution proves how the issuing and settlement processes of private blockchains and wholesale CBDC will interact in future. As issuer  banks benefit from the speed  scalability and security of the new technology ” said Silvio Lenk  Head of Treasury at DekaBank.“To explore the potential of digital assets  you have to take care of the whole lifecycle - from issuance via dvp settlement to maturity including the utilisation of central bank money. Participating in the ECB trials with strong partners like Deutsche Börse Group and DekaBank  we are delighted to get valuable insights on our way to higher efficiency ” Dr. Holger Meffert  Head of Securities Services & Digital Custody at DZ Bank  pointed out.Jens Hachmeister  Head of Issuer Services & New Digital Markets at Clearstream  said: “With the next-generation digital post-trade platform D7 Clearstream aims to digitise the entire post-trade value chain. With our new D7 DLT  launched for the ECB trials  we provide seamless processing of digital assets and high-quality cash on-chain  which is an important step in developing a digital European securities landscape.

Participating Creditors will also have the option to fund  as part of the Potential Capital Increase  an additional amount of cash up to €75 million (the “Optional Additional Equity”); The equitization of €2.8 billion (in addition to the €100 million previously equitized) of Atos’ financial debt increased by the amount of accrued and unpaid interests due to Atos’ financial creditors as from the opening of the accelerated safeguard procedure  through two share capital increases without preferential subscription right  one reserved to the Participating Creditors (with  if applicable5  a priority period (délai de priorité) for the benefit of existing shareholders)  the other reserved to creditors not participating in the new financing (the “Non-Participating Creditors”) (with  if applicable6  a priority period (délai de priorité) for the benefit of existing shareholders) (the “Equitization Capital Increases”). The Equitization Capital Increase reserved to Non-Participating Creditors will be offered on less favorable conditions than the one offered to Participating Creditors. Any cash proceeds resulting from the subscription by existing shareholders to these Equitization Capital Increases under their priority rights will be used in full to repay the Company’s relevant unsecured financial creditors at par value in due proportion;(together the “Financial Restructuring Capital Increases”)A contribution between €1.5 billion and €1.675 billion of new secured financings (new money debt) (depending on the amount of cash subscriptions to the Rights Issue and of the Optional Additional Equity as part of the Potential Capital Increase) to be subscribed in equivalent proportions by (i) the bank creditors holding at the Record Date (as defined below) debt under the €1.5 billion term loan A maturing in January 2025 and the €900 million revolving credit facility maturing in November 2025 (the “Loans”) and (ii) the bondholders holding at the Record Date bonds issued by Atos maturing in 2024  2025  2026  2028 and 2029 (the “Bonds”).The aim of these transactions is to secure the Group’s future financial equilibrium  with a reduction in net debt by circa €3.1 billion  that should enable the Company to achieve its target to regain a BB credit rating profile by 2026.These transactions will guarantee minimum liquidity amount of €1.1 billion until December 31  2026.Changes in shareholder structure following the completion of the financial restructuring expected by 2024 year-end / Q1 2025Following the completion of the financial restructuring transactions described above  the Company emphasizes that Atos’ financial creditors will become the Company’s main shareholders.The Agreement also provides the possibility for the entry of a potential anchor investor as part of the Financial Restructuring Capital Increases.Pursuant to the Agreement  if:a) No existing shareholder subscribes to the Rights Issue;b) No existing shareholder subscribes to any of the other Financial Restructuring Capital Increases during the priority period (délai de priorité) (if any)  andc) Only the financial creditors supporting the Agreement subscribe to the Financial Restructuring Capital Increases under their respective backstop commitments the ownership percentages would be  according to the principles set out in the Agreement and the valuations adopted by the parties  as follows:for the Company’s existing shareholders  below 0.1% following completion of all the Financial Restructuring Capital Increases;for the Company’s financial creditors  circa 99.9% upon completion of all the Financial Restructuring Capital Increases.Assuming that all existing shareholders subscribe to the Financial Restructuring Capital Increases the ownership percentages7 would be  according to the principles set out in the Agreement and the valuations adopted by the parties  as follows:for the Company's existing shareholders  circa 25.9% upon completion of all the Financial Restructuring Capital Increases;for the Company's financial creditors  circa 74.1% upon completion of all the Financial Restructuring Capital Increases.Existing shareholders (for their current shareholding) Existing shareholders (for the shares subscribed under the €233 million Rights Issue) Financial creditors 100% participation in the €233 million Rights Issue8 0.05% 25.83% 74.12% 0% participation in the €233 million Rights Issue 0.06% - 99.94%In view of the dilution expected to result from the Financial Restructuring Capital Increases  the Board of Directors of the Company will  on a voluntary basis pursuant to Article 261-3 of the AMF General Regulation  appoint an independent expert to issue an opinion on the financial restructuring.

Professor Valerie Pourcher MD  PhD  Chaiman of the Infectious Diseases department at Pitié Salpetriere  presented the COVA phase 2/3 clincial study results in a context where the number of Covid cases rises again. Dr. Claudia Ferreira MD  PhD  Medical Director at Biophytis  opened the conference with a keynote presentation on the risk of infectious diseases and further pandemic developments associated with the Paris Olympic games including an increase of +52 % in emergency room (ER) visits due to SARS-CoV-2 on the week of 10-17 June 2024 in France. She also chaired several roundtables. Valerie Pourcher detailed the results of the randomised  placebo-controlled Phase 2/3 COVA study and the efficacy of oral BIO101 (20-hydroxyecdysone) administered orally in adult patients hospitalised for severe forms of COVID-19. The results of this phase 2-3 study  evaluating BIO101 in the treatment of severe hospitalised COVID-19 patients  are positive and show  in addition to a very good safety profile  a statistically significant reduction in the relative risk of early respiratory failure or death of 43.8% and a 44.6% reduction in the death rate over 90 days. Stanislas Veillet  CEO of Biophytis  stated: "" The Covid pandemic is far from over: according to the World Health Organization  134 797 new cases of Covid-19 and 1 691 deaths have been reported worldwide in the last 28 days as of June 9 - a figure that is underestimated due to under-reporting. Our COVA program  which showed very positive resullts  positions BIO101 (20-hydroxyecdysone) as a leading drug candidate for severe forms of Covid-19  particularly in elderly patients with co-morbidities  that is independent of the SARS-COV2 strain.""
