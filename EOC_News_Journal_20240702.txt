The issuances took place in the context of the ECB trials aimed at exploring the potential of DLT for settling wholesale transactions in central bank money.The processes entirely run on Deutsche Börse’s D7 DLT. This includes both the transaction of the security itself and the transfer of funds using digital central bank money - from issuance via distribution and settlement to full lifecycle management. DekaBank acted as issuer  DZ Bank as investor - with swapped roles in the second case. Clearstream acted as DLT Market Operator  providing the technical infrastructure with its digital securities platform D7 developed in strategic partnership with Google Cloud. By connecting D7 with the Bundesbank Trigger Solution  the bond settlement is seamlessly reflected in the European TARGET2 payment system.The transactions mark the first institutional-grade issuances in Germany on DLT using wholesale digital central bank money. Issuing securities on DLT increases transparency and automation  which reduces the need for manual intervention. Additionally  using central bank money provides enhanced safety  liquidity and monetary policy alignment for issuers and investors alike.“The use case impresses with the simplicity of issuing a security with DLT technology and at the same time benefiting from the advantages of the Trigger Solution. The delivery versus payment of the Trigger Solution proves how the issuing and settlement processes of private blockchains and wholesale CBDC will interact in future. As issuer  banks benefit from the speed  scalability and security of the new technology ” said Silvio Lenk  Head of Treasury at DekaBank.“To explore the potential of digital assets  you have to take care of the whole lifecycle - from issuance via dvp settlement to maturity including the utilisation of central bank money. Participating in the ECB trials with strong partners like Deutsche Börse Group and DekaBank  we are delighted to get valuable insights on our way to higher efficiency ” Dr. Holger Meffert  Head of Securities Services & Digital Custody at DZ Bank  pointed out.Jens Hachmeister  Head of Issuer Services & New Digital Markets at Clearstream  said: “With the next-generation digital post-trade platform D7 Clearstream aims to digitise the entire post-trade value chain. With our new D7 DLT  launched for the ECB trials  we provide seamless processing of digital assets and high-quality cash on-chain  which is an important step in developing a digital European securities landscape. This transaction represents a significant milestone for the creation of stable digital capital markets in Germany and Europe  demonstrating the power of digital solutions in enhancing safety  liquidity and efficiency.”The ECB trials are conducted in a productive environment  using real central bank money.

The approval was unanimously endorsed by Member States following a stringent assessment by the European Medicines Agency (EMA)1. The EC decision marks the third approval the Company has received for IXCHIQ® following approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in November 2023 and Health Canada last month2. The Company expects to deliver the first doses in Europe in the fourth quarter of 2024.IXCHIQ® is the world’s only licensed chikungunya vaccine available to address this unmet medical need. In accordance with the International Recognition Procedure (IRP)3  Valneva has also submitted a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) to the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). An additional marketing authorization application is under review by the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency (ANVISA) to make the vaccine available in certain Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMIC)  with potential approval in 2024.Juan Carlos Jaramillo  M.D.  Chief Medical Officer of Valneva  commented  “The EC approval marks a crucial milestone toward making this vaccine available to as many European citizens as possible. In recent years  climate change has caused the Aedes mosquito  a known carrier of chikungunya and dengue viruses  to spread to areas in Europe that were previously unaffected. It is critical to provide a vaccine solution not only to European travelers going to endemic chikungunya areas  such as South America or Africa  but also to the local European populations experiencing invasive mosquito attacks. We would like to thank our partner  CEPI  for supporting us in this endeavor.”Dr. Richard Hatchett  Chief Executive Officer of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI)  commented  “Supported by CEPI and EU funding  IXCHIQ is the world’s first vaccine offering protection against the debilitating Chikungunya virus. The EU’s rapid approval of the vaccine  following recommendation by the European Medicines Agency  is a historic moment to help protect the lives and livelihoods of European populations against Chikungunya outbreaks  which are becoming more frequent and widespread in the region. But the fight is not over – as a matter of priority CEPI is working with Valneva and the EU to expand access to the vaccine to those living in endemic countries who are greatest risk from the disease.”The EC marketing authorization follows the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) positive opinion a month ago4 and is supported by data from the pivotal Phase 3 study which were published in The Lancet  and showed a 98.9% seroresponse rate at 28 days with a single vaccination. This immune response was sustained for 24 months by 97% of participants and was equally durable in younger and older adults5. Last month  Valneva reported further positive pivotal data in adolescents six months after a single vaccination  which are intended to support filing for potential label extension for use in adolescents aged 12 to 17 years6. The data are also expected to support licensure of IXCHIQ® in Brazil  which would be the first potential approval for use in an endemic population.Valneva partnered with CEPI 7 and Instituto Butantan in Brazil8 to make the vaccine more accessible to LMIC. The collaboration falls within the framework of the agreement signed between CEPI and Valneva in July 20199  which provides funding of up to $24.6 million with support from the European Union’s Horizon 2020 program.About ChikungunyaChikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne viral disease spread by the bites of infected Aedes mosquitoes which causes fever  severe joint pain  muscle pain  headache  nausea  fatigue and rash. Joint pain is often debilitating and can persist for weeks to years.10In 2004  the disease began to spread quickly  causing large-scale outbreaks around the world. Since the re-emergence of the virus  CHIKV has now been identified in over 110 countries in Asia  Africa  Europe and the Americas.11 Between 2013 and 2023  more than 3.7 million cases were reported in the Americas12 and the economic impact is considered to be significant. The medical and economic burden is expected to grow with climate change as the mosquito vectors that transmit the disease continue to spread geographically. As such  the World Health Organization (WHO) has highlighted chikungunya as a major public health problem.13About Valneva SEWe are a specialty vaccine company that develops  manufactures  and commercializes prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases addressing unmet medical needs.

Genio offers patients a leadless  fully-body MRI compatible  non-implanted battery solution  powered and controlled by a wearable. Thanks to the fully upgradable wearable component  Genio patients can always have access to the most advanced technology without needing another surgery. In March 2024  Nyxoah announced the DREAM U.S. pivotal study data achieved a statistically significant reduction in the co-primary endpoints of 12-month AHI responder rate  per the Sher criteria  and ODI responder rate  both on an intent-to-treat basis  and that Genio is the only HGNS solution to show similar outcomes in supine and non-supine sleep.“I am proud to achieve this important milestone  which brings us one step closer to offering Genio to obstructive sleep apnea patients in the U.S. I would like to congratulate our entire team on their hard work in completing the PMA submission. I could not be more excited for the remainder of 2024  which includes presenting the complete DREAM data at the International Surgical Sleep Society meeting in September and preparing for a U.S. launch by the end of the year ” commented Olivier Taelman  Nyxoah’s Chief Executive Officer.About NyxoahNyxoah is a medical technology company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative solutions to treat Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA). Nyxoah’s lead solution is the Genio® system  a patient-centered  leadless and battery-free hypoglossal neurostimulation therapy for OSA  the world’s most common sleep disordered breathing condition that is associated with increased mortality risk and cardiovascular comorbidities. Nyxoah is driven by the vision that OSA patients should enjoy restful nights and feel enabled to live their life to its fullest.Following the successful completion of the BLAST OSA study  the Genio® system received its European CE Mark in 2019.

THIS ANNOUNCEMENT DOES NOT CONSTITUTE AN OFFER OF ANY OF THE SECURITIES DESCRIBED HEREIN.Trondheim  2 July 2024: NORBIT ASA (""NORBIT"" or the ""Company"") (Euronext Oslo Børs trading symbol: NORBT) announces a contemplated private placement (the ""Private Placement"") of new ordinary shares in the Company (the ""Offer Shares"") to raise gross proceeds of up to NOK 200 million. The Company has engaged Arctic Securities AS and SpareBank 1 Markets AS as joint lead managers and bookrunners for the Private Placement (the ""Managers"").PRIVATE PLACEMENTSize and Offer PriceIn the Private Placement  the Company is offering a number of Offer Shares to raise gross proceeds of up to NOK 200 million.The subscription price per Offer Share (the ""Offer Price"") and the final number of Offer Shares to be issued in the Private Placement will be determined by the board of directors of the Company (the ""Board"")  on the basis of an accelerated bookbuilding process to be conducted by the Managers.Use of proceedsThe net proceeds from the Private Placement to the Company will be used to partially finance the acquisition of 100% of the equity interest in Innomar Technologie GmBH (""Innomar"")  to strengthen the Company's financial flexibility and capital base for future growth  and for general corporate purposes.Acquisition of InnomarAs set out in the Company's stock exchange announcement of 27 June 2024  the Company has entered into a share purchase agreement to acquire 100 per cent of the equity interest in the technology company Innomar.Innomar has become the global market leader in design  manufacturing and distribution of parametric sub-bottom profilers. Complementary to NORBIT’s multibeam sonars in the Oceans segment  which are primarily used for seabed mapping  inspection and subsurface navigation  sub-bottom profilers are used to explore subsurface layers.Over the last five years  Innomar has reported an annual revenue growth of nearly 15% on average driven by strong demand for technology in the maritime domain to explore the ocean space. On a combined basis  Innomar would add NOK 76 million in EBIT for the twelve-month period from 1 April 2023 to 31 March 2024  bringing NORBIT’s and Innomar’s combined EBIT for the period to NOK 323 million.Story continuesThe acquisition is based on an enterprise value of Innomar  on a cash and debt-free basis and assuming a normalised working capital of EUR 40.5 million. Subject to final post-closing balance sheet calculations  the Company will at closing of the transaction pay a preliminary purchase price of EUR 39.9 million for the Innomar equity interest  of which EUR 35.1 million shall be settled in cash and of which EUR 4.8 million shall be settled in consideration shares in the Company to be issued at the Offer Price to the founding management of Innomar in conjunction with closing of the acquisition and by applying the applicable EUR/NOK exchange rate at the time immediately prior to closing.Completion of the acquisition is subject to a limited number of customary closing conditions.

If the Bookbuilding Period is shortened or extended  the other dates referred to herein may be amended accordingly.AllocationAllocation of Offer Shares will be determined after completion of the Bookbuilding Period. The Allocation will be made by the Board in its sole discretion  in consultation with the Managers  based on allocation criteria such as (but not limited to) existing ownership in the Company  pre-commitments  price leadership  timeliness of order  relative order size  perceived investor quality  sector knowledge and investment horizon. The Board reserves the right at its sole discretion  to reject and/or reduce any orders  in whole or in part. The Board and the Managers further reserve the right  at their sole discretion  to take into account the creditworthiness of any applicant. There is no guarantee that any potential investor will be allocated shares.Notification of allocation and payment instructions are expected to be sent by the Managers on or about 3 July 2024.Selling restrictionsThe Private Placement will be directed towards Norwegian and international investors  in each case subject to applicable exemptions from relevant registration  filing and prospectus requirements  and subject to other applicable selling restrictions. The minimum application amount has been set to the NOK equivalent of EUR 100 000. The Company may  however  at its sole discretion  allocate Offer Shares for amounts below the NOK equivalent of EUR 100 000 to the extent of exemptions from the prospectus requirements in accordance with applicable regulations  including the EU Prospectus Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2017/1129 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 14 June 2017) and ancillary regulations  as implemented pursuant to the Norwegian Securities Trading Act  are available.SettlementThe date for settlement of Offer Shares is expected to be on or about 5 July 2024  subject to  among other things  any shortening or extension of the Bookbuilding Period and fulfilment of the Conditions (as defined below). Delivery of the Offer Shares is expected to be made on a delivery-versus-payment (""DVP"") basis through the delivery of existing and unencumbered shares in the Company  already listed on Euronext Oslo Børs  pursuant to a share lending agreement between the Managers and Reitan Kapital AS as share lender and the Company (the ""Share Lending Agreement""). The Offer Shares allocated to investors in the Private Placement will accordingly be tradable on Euronext Oslo Børs from receipt of the notification of allocation.Under the Share Lending Arrangement  the Managers will borrow up to a number of shares from Reitan Kapital AS equal to the number of Offer Shares allocated in the Private Placement to facilitate DVP settlement to investors in the Private Placement. The share lending will be settled with new shares in the Company to be issued by the Board pursuant to the authorization granted by a general meeting of the Company held on 6 May 2024.Conditions for completionCompletion of the Private Placement  by delivery of Offer Shares to investors  is subject to (i) all corporate resolutions required to implement the Private Placement being validly made by the Company  including  without limitation  the resolution by the Board to increase the share capital of the Company and issue the Offer Shares pursuant to an authorization granted by the Company’s annual general meeting held on 6 May 2024  and (ii) the Share Lending Agreement remaining in full force and effect (jointly  the “Conditions”).The Company reserves the right to cancel  and/or modify the terms of  the Private Placement at any time and for any reason prior to the notification of allocation. Neither the Company nor the Managers  or any of their respective directors  officers  employees or representatives  will be liable for any losses incurred by applicants if the Private Placement is cancelled and/or modified  irrespective of the reason for such cancellation or modification.Dilutive instruments  etc.The Company has 219 626 outstanding restricted stock units (RSU) to members of the executive management and key personnel  granting the right to receive shares in NORBIT at par value. The RSUs vest over two year periods  where 1/3 vest at grant  1/3 vest at the annual general meeting held the year after grant  and the remaining 1/3 vest at the annual general meeting held the second year after grant. Out of the currently outstanding RSUs  180 737 RSUs where granted in 2024  while 38 889 RSUs where granted in 2023.As further described in the Company's 2023 annual report  the Company has implemented a share incentive program for NORBIT employees. The incentive program is structured as a share matching program where participants are offered the opportunity to acquire shares at market value  and in turn  obtain a right to receive compensation in new shares equivalent to their invested amount after 24 months if certain conditions are met. It is expected that the Company will issue approximately 90 000 new shares during July 2024 to eligible employees who participated in the program in 2022.Equal treatment considerationsThe Board has considered the Private Placement in light of the equal treatment obligations under section 5-14 of the Norwegian Securities Trading Act  section 2.1 of the Oslo Rule Book II  and Oslo Børs' Circular no. 2/2014. The issuance of the Offer Shares is carried out as a private placement in order to  among other things  raise equity to partially finance the acquisition of 100% of the equity interest in Innomar and to strengthen the Company's financial flexibility and capital base for future growth.The Board is of the view that it is in the common interest of the Company and its shareholders to raise equity through a private placement  in particularly in light of the current market conditions and the purpose for which the funds are raised. By structuring the equity raise as a private placement  the Company is expected to raise equity efficiently and in a timely manner  at a favorable price and at a lower cost  and with a significantly reduced completion risk  compared to a rights issue. It has also been taken into consideration that the Private Placement is based on a publicly announced accelerated bookbuilding process.Potential subsequent offeringThe Company may  subject to completion of the Private Placement and certain other conditions  decide to carry out a subsequent offering of new shares at the Offer Price in the Private Placement (the ""Subsequent Offering""). The Subsequent Offering  if carried out  will  subject to applicable securities law  be directed towards existing shareholders in the Company as of 2 July 2024 (as registered in the VPS two trading days thereafter)  who (i) were not included in the pre-sounding phase of the Private Placement  (ii) were not allocated Offer Shares in the Private Placement  and (iii) are not resident in a jurisdiction where such offering would be unlawful or  would (in jurisdictions other than Norway) require any prospectus  filing  registration or similar action. The Company reserves the right in its sole discretion to not conduct or to cancel the Subsequent Offering.Any potential Subsequent Offering is subject to completion of the Private Placement and may be contingent upon the publication of a prospectus.AdvisorsArctic Securities AS and SpareBank 1 Markets AS are acting as joint lead managers and bookrunners for the Private Placement.
