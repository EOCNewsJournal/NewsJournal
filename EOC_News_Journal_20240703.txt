The Meeting will be held at ST Business Centre  120  The Strand  Gzira  GZR 1027  Malta. Instructions for participation are provided in section 3 of this notice. The Meeting will be conducted in the English language and will be held in person. 1 MATTERS ON THE AGENDA OF THE MEETING At the Meeting  the following matters will be considered: General: Opening of the Meeting and appointment of chairman The appointment of the chairman shall be carried out in terms of article 59 of the Company’s articles of association (the “Articles”). Quorum In terms of article 56 of the Articles at least one (1) shareholder  present in person or by proxy  entitled to attend and vote at the Meeting shall constitute a quorum. Special business (extraordinary resolutions): Approval of the Conversion of the Company into a Public Limited Liability Company and Corresponding Change in the Name of the Company and Amendments to the Company’s Memorandum and Articles of Association The Company’s board of directors (“Board”) proposes that the shareholders approve by means of an extraordinary resolution the conversion of the Company from a societas europaea to a public limited liability company (“p.l.c.”) as defined under article 2 of the Companies Act  Chapter 386 of the laws of Malta (the “Companies Act”) in accordance with the provisions of article 66 of Council Regulation (EC) No. 2571/2011  as amended (the “SE Regulation”) (the “Conversion”). In this regard  the Board has  pursuant to article 66 of the SE Regulation produced draft terms of conversion (the “Draft Terms of Conversion”) and a report (“Directors’ Report”) to (a) explain and justify the economic and legal aspects of the Conversion  and (b) define the implications of the Conversion for the Company’s shareholders and employees. Prior to the Meeting the Board will also be procuring a report by PricewaterhouseCoopers Malta (as independent experts) confirming that the Company has assets at least equivalent to its capital (the “Expert Report”). Shareholders are informed that the Draft Terms of Conversion are in the process of being reviewed for publication by the Malta Business Registry (“MBR”) in terms of article 66 of the SE Regulation. Furthermore  and in connection with the Conversion  the Board proposes to (1) change the name of the Company from ‘Multitude SE’ to ‘Multitude p.l.c.’ and (2) substitute the Company’s current memorandum and articles of association (“M&A”) in their entirety in order to  amongst other things  reflect the change in the Company’s name and bring the M&A in line with the requirements of the Companies Act relating to public limited liability companies (the “Revised M&A”). The Board therefore proposes that the Meeting adopts the following extraordinary resolution: “(1) That the conversion of the Company from a societas europaea to a public limited liability company (“Conversion”) in accordance with Council Regulation (EC) No. 2571/2011  as amended (the “SE Regulation”) be hereby approved; (2) That the draft terms of conversion explaining and justifying the legal and economic aspects of the Conversion and indicating the implications of the Conversion for the Company’s shareholders and employees be hereby approved; (3) That all amendments proposed to be made to the Company’s current memorandum and articles of association (“Current M&A”) be approved and that the Current M&A be substituted in their entirety by the updated memorandum and articles of association in the form  or in substantially the same form  as circulated to shareholders together with the notice of the Extraordinary General Meeting (“Revised M&A”); and (4) To authorise the company secretary and/or any one director of the Company  acting singly  to: (i) carry out all such acts and execute any and all such documents that may be required in order to give effect to these resolutions; (ii) make any amendments to the Revised M&A as directed by the Malta Business Registry; (iii) sign the Revised M&A on behalf of the Company; (iv) to issue a certified extract of these resolutions; and (v) file the Revised M&A and the aforementioned extract with the MBR  and/or any other competent authority  as may be required in terms of law.” Approval of the Redomiciliation of the Company to Switzerland after completion of the Conversion As part of the Company’s wider relocation project  the Board proposes that  subject to the successful implementation of the Conversion (i.e. the conversion of Multitude from a societas europaea to a Maltese public limited liability company)  the Company proceeds to commence the process of redomiciling out of Malta and into Switzerland in accordance with the provisions of the Continuation of Companies Regulations (Subsidiary Legislation 386.05 of the laws of Malta) and Swiss law (more specifically the relevant provisions of the Swiss International Private Law Act). The Board also notes that the redomiciliation to Switzerland is subject to (a) the receipt by the Company of a favourable ruling from FINMA  and (b) the rulings issued by the Finnish Tax Administration becoming legally enforceable (meaning that no appeals against the decisions have been submitted to the Helsinki Administrative Court within the time limit specified in the notice of appeal for each decision  and in case of an appeal process  the legal enforceability of the decisions is obtained in case (i) the decisions of the Helsinki Administrative Court have not been appealed or (ii) if the Supreme Administrative Court does not grant the right to appeal to the decisions and  finally  (iii) in case of positive rulings from the Supreme Administrative Court). The Company has received advice that  under the laws of Switzerland  the Company’s registration in the Commercial Register of the Canton Zug  Switzerland as a company continuing in Switzerland shall not operate to prejudice or affect the continuity of the Company nor shall it affect the property of the Company and the Company shall retain all its assets  rights  liabilities and obligations. In this regard  the Board has prepared  for the benefit of the shareholders  a table comparing the rights enjoyed by minority shareholders under Maltese law to those enjoyed by minority shareholders under Swiss law (the “Comparative Table”). The Board therefore proposes that the Meeting adopts the following extraordinary resolution  which includes an approval of the revised articles of association in accordance with Swiss corporate law which will begin to apply when the redomiciliation from Malta to Switzerland takes effect (the “Swiss Articles of Association”): “(1) Change of domicile from Malta to Zug (Canton Zug)  Switzerland To approve the redomiciliation of the Company from Malta to Zug  Switzerland in accordance with the provisions of the Continuation of Companies Regulations (Subsidiary Legislation 386.05 of the laws of Malta) and Swiss law  upon and subject to (a) the Conversion (i.e. the conversion of Multitude from a societas europaea to a Maltese public limited liability company) becoming effective (i.e. once the Company’s Revised M&A is registered by the Malta Business Registry) (the “Redomiciliation”)  (b) the rulings issued by the Finnish Tax Administration becoming legally enforceable (meaning that no appeals against the decisions have been submitted to the Helsinki Administrative Court within the time limit specified in the notice of appeal for each decision  and in case of an appeal process  the legal enforceability of the decisions is obtained in case (i) the decisions of the Helsinki Administrative Court have not been appealed or (ii) if the Supreme Administrative Court does not grant the right to appeal to the decisions and  finally  (iii) in case of positive rulings from the Supreme Administrative Court) and (c) receipt of a favourable ruling from FINMA ; (2) Change of registered seat That following the Redomiciliation  the Company's new registered office will be located in the City of Zug (Canton Zug  Switzerland); (3) Change of the name of the Company To approve the change to the Company name from Multitude p.l.c. to Multitude AG (with translations: ""Multitude Ltd"" and ""Multitude SA"")  upon and subject to the Redomiciliation becoming effective. As a result  and taking into account the transfer of the registered office under resolution (2) above  article 1 of the Swiss Articles of Association (as defined in resolution (5) below) will therefore read as follows: Firma und SitzUnter der FirmaMultitude AG(Multitude Ltd)(Multitude SA)besteht mit Sitz in Zug auf unbestimmte Dauer eine Aktiengesellschaft gemäss Art. 620 ff. des Schweizerischen Obligationenrechts (OR) (die ""Gesellschaft"").Name and Registered SeatUnder the corporate name ofMultitude AG(Multitude Ltd)(Multitude SA)exists for an unlimited period of time a corporation limited by shares according to art. 620 et seq. of the Swiss Code of Obligations (CO) with registered seat in Zug (the ""Company"").(4) Change of the purpose of the Company To approve to change the wording relating to the Company's purpose in article 2 of the Swiss Articles of Association (as defined in resolution (5) below)  upon and subject to the Redomiciliation becoming effective  to read as follows: 2 Zweck1 Zweck der Gesellschaft ist der Erwerb  das Halten  die Verwaltung  die Verwertung und die Veräusserung von in- und ausländischen Beteiligungen  ob direkt oder indirekt  unter anderem an Unternehmen  die insbesondere in den Bereichen Finanzdienstleistungen wie Verbraucherkrediten  Mikrokrediten und anderen Krediten und Finanzierungen tätig sind  sowie die Erbringung von Dienstleistungen  intern oder für andere Tochtergesellschaften des Konzerns  zu dem die Gesellschaft gehört.2 Die Gesellschaft kann Beteiligungen an Gesellschaften aller Art in der Schweiz und im Ausland erwerben  halten  verwalten und veräussern.3 Die Gesellschaft kann ausserdem alle Geschäfte abschliessen und Vereinbarungen eingehen  die direkt oder indirekt dem Gesellschaftszweck dienen oder mit diesem in direktem Zusammenhang stehen.4 Die Gesellschaft kann ihren direkten oder indirekten Tochtergesellschaften (direkt oder indirekt) Darlehen oder andere Finanzierungen gewähren.

The agreement is based on positive outcomes from the CABINET Phase III trial  led by the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology and sponsored by the National Cancer Institute (NCI)  which investigated Cabometyx versus placebo in people living with advanced pNETs or advanced epNETs whose disease had progressed after prior systemic therapy. An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board recommended to stop accrual to the study  unblind patients and allow crossover from placebo to Cabometyx. This was due to early efficacy demonstrated at an interim analysis in both of the trial’s cohorts  with clinically meaningful improvements in progression-free survival (PFS).1“With many people diagnosed with neuroendocrine tumors at an advanced stage of disease and treatment options limited upon progression  the need for efficacious new therapies is extensive ” said Christelle Huguet  EVP and Head of Research and Development  Ipsen. “The positive results demonstrated for Cabometyx within the CABINET Phase III trial represent clinically meaningful improvements in progression-free survival at a challenging stage of disease where there are few or no available treatment options. We look forward to discussing these clinical findings with regulatory authorities.”Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are a group of uncommon tumors that develop in the cells of the neuroendocrine system throughout the body.2 3 The symptoms of NETs are often not distinct and difficult to identify  leading to delays in diagnosis  with 58% of people presenting with metastatic disease at diagnosis.3 The number of people newly diagnosed with NETs is believed to be rising due to increasing awareness and better methods of diagnosis  with approximately 35 in every 100 000 people currently living with NETs globally.3 4 The survival rate varies greatly depending on the primary site and stage of disease  however for people living with advanced pNETs which has spread to distant parts of the body  the prognosis is poor  with a five-year survival rate of 23%.5CABINET Phase III trialData from the study  which demonstrated PFS benefits at interim analyses  were presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology Congress 2023 by Professor Jennifer Chan  MD  MPH  Dana-Farber Cancer Institute  Boston:1In the pNET cohort  at a median follow-up of 16.7 months  median PFS based on local radiology review was 11.4 months for Cabometyx versus 3.0 months for placebo (hazard ratio (HR) 0.27 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.14-0.49] p<0.0001) 1In the epNET cohort  at a median follow-up of 13.9 months  median PFS based on local radiology review was 8.3 months for Cabometyx versus 3.2 months for placebo (HR 0.45 [95% CI 0.30-0.66] p<0.0001) 1The safety profile of Cabometyx observed in each cohort was consistent with its known safety profile; no new safety signals were identified1ENDSAbout CabometyxCabometyx (cabozantinib) is a small molecule that inhibits multiple receptor tyrosine kinases  including VEGFRs  MET  RET and the TAM family (TYRO3  MER  AXL).6 These receptor tyrosine kinases are involved in both normal cellular function and pathologic processes such as oncogenesis  metastasis  tumor angiogenesis (the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow)  drug resistance  modulation of immune activities and maintenance of the tumor microenvironment.6 7 8 9In 2016  Exelixis granted Ipsen exclusive rights for the commercialization and further clinical development of Cabometyx outside of the U.S. and Japan. In 2017  Exelixis granted exclusive rights to Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (Takeda) for the commercialization and further clinical development of Cabometyx for all future indications in Japan. Exelixis holds the exclusive rights to develop and commercialize Cabometyx in the U.S.In over 60 countries outside of the U.S. and Japan  including in the E.U.  Cabometyx is currently indicated as a:7Monotherapy for advanced renal cell carcinoma (aRCC). as first-line treatment of adults with intermediate- or poor-risk disease. in adults following prior VEGFR-targeted therapy.In combination with nivolumab for the first-line treatment of aRCC in adults.Monotherapy for the treatment of adults living with locally advanced or metastatic differentiated thyroid carcinoma  refractory or not eligible to radioactive iodine who have progressed during or after prior systemic therapy.Monotherapy for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma in adults who have previously been treated with sorafenib.The detailed recommendations for the use of Cabometyx are described in the Summary of Product Characteristics (EU SmPC).About neuroendocrine tumorsNETs are relatively uncommon and develop from cells of the neuroendocrine system; thus  can arise from a variety of locations throughout the body.2 3 The most common sites of NETs include the gastrointestinal (GI) tract  lungs and pancreas.2 10 Most NETs take years to develop and grow slowly  however some NETs can be fast-growing.2 The symptoms of NETs are often difficult to identify leading to patients being seen by multiple specialists and undergoing extensive testing before diagnosis is confirmed.3 As a result  almost a third of people take at least 5 years to be diagnosed with NETs.3 The five-year survival rate is dependent on the primary site of disease. For advanced GI-NET and lung NETs  where the cancer has spread to distant parts of the body  the five-year survival rates are 68% and 55%  respectively.11 12 For people diagnosed with advanced pNET  however  the prognosis is poor  with a five-year survival rate of 23%.5About CABINETCABINET (randomized  double-blinded Phase III trial of CABozantinib versus placebo In patients with advanced NEuroendocrine Tumors after progression on prior therapy) is sponsored by the National Cancer Institute (NCI)  part of the National Institutes of Health  and is being led and conducted by the NCI-funded Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology with participation from the NCI-funded National Clinical Trials Network  as part of Exelixis’ collaboration through a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement with the NCI’s Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program.The multicenter  Phase III CABINET pivotal trial enrolled a total of 290 patients in the U.S at the time of the interim analyses. Patients were randomized 2:1 to Cabometyx or placebo in two separate cohorts (pNET  n=93; epNET  n=197). The epNET cohort included patients with the following primary tumor sites: gastrointestinal tract  lung  unknown and other. Each cohort was randomized separately and had its own statistical analysis plan. Patients must have had measurable disease per RECIST 1.1 criteria and must have experienced disease progression or intolerance after at least one U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved line of prior therapy other than somatostatin analogs. The primary endpoint in each cohort was PFS per RECIST 1.1 by retrospective independent central review. Upon confirmation of disease progression  patients were unblinded  and those receiving placebo were permitted to cross over to open-label therapy with Cabometyx. Secondary endpoints included overall survival  radiographic response rate and safety.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law. Ipsen’s business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers.

(NYSE: STLA / Euronext Milan: STLAM / Euronext Paris: STLAP) and Archer Aviation Inc. (NYSE:ACHR)  a leader in electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft  today announced Archer has received an additional $55 million investment from Stellantis under the companies’ strategic funding agreement following the achievement of its transition flight test milestone last month.This latest investment builds on Stellantis’ series of open market purchases of 8.3 million shares of Archer’s stock in March of this year that was previously announced. During 2023  Stellantis invested $110 million in Archer through a combination of open market stock purchases and investments under the companies’ strategic funding agreement.Archer remains on track to complete construction of its high-volume manufacturing facility in Georgia later this year. This first phase of the build out is a ~350 000 square foot facility on an ~100 acre site designed to support production of up to 650 aircraft annually  which would make it one of the largest manufacturing facilities by volume in the aircraft industry.

We are now fully able to capitalize on our solid assets to develop the sales of the Ikoniscope20 platform benefitting from a unique integrated vertical solution  now integrating also by the products of the recently-acquired Hospitex International  best-in-class in their category. Boosted by proprietary AI features  we continue our mission of helping our customers and patients in the earlier detection of cancer cells  in particular in the fast-growing CTC market. Strengthened by the partnership with Biocare Medical that provided us with an increased financial visibility in the coming years and potential additional recurring revenues  we now aim at expanding our commercial footprint both in the US and Europe.2023 and H1 2024 key highlightsThe 2023 fiscal year was extremely structuring for the Company that laid the foundations for the exciting developments that already took place in the first half of 2024.From a commercial point of view  the commercialization of the Ikoniscope20max is ongoing  with a new configuration of the Ikoniscope20 platform that was specifically studied for high-volume laboratories. This instrument is of particular interest for the USA  the largest market for Ikonisys  where the Company has recorded an increase in the number of FISH tests performed.Furthermore  to fully tackle the US market  Ikonisys signed an agreement with Biocare Medical  a US leader in immunohistochemistry (IHC) and FISH (Fluorescent in situ hybridization) tools and reagents with 4 000+ customers  in October 2023. This alliance focuses on expanding the global distribution of Ikoniscope20 platform  notably in the US. Thanks to this collaboration  together with the ongoing commercial developments  Ikonisys has expanded its visibility over the next two years and expects to reach annual revenues between €5 and €7 million by that time. Moreover  the Company secured recurring revenues in the form of royalties on reagents sold by Biocare to users of the Ikoniscope20 platform.Continuing on the strategic moves implemented by the management  in November 2023  Ikonisys announced the acquisition of Hospitex International  an Italian company leader in the cytology field  thanks to their ability to prepare the best slides in the world. Ikonisys will integrate Hospitex's extensive expertise in slide preparation  completing its existing solutions in automated slide analysis. Together  the Companies will offer a premium efficient cancer diagnostic on a global scale  benefitting from an extended geographical reach and a common customer base.On the R&D side  two major projects have been completed with the Ikoniscope20 platform and the high-volume system Ikoniscope20max  accordingly with the Company's innovation DNA. In order to be able to exploit the full capabilities of AI  Ikonisys started the development of another upgrade to all the platforms  with the integration of an ultra-high-resolution camera and more powerful hardware. This will be also benefitting from efforts put in the CTCs detection field  for early detection of cancer and monitoring of treatment.2023 Full-Year Results vs. 2022 - Simplified consolidated income statement (audited)Euros FY 2023 FY 2022 Net Sales 448 557 616 866 Other income 196 616 318 352 Cost of goods sold (192 730) (183 413) Operating expenses (2 646 172) (3 186 585) Operating income / (loss) (2 193 729) (2 434 784) Financial income / (loss) (73 918) (13 537) Taxes - - Net income / (loss) (2 267 646) (2 448 320) Cash and cash equivalents at end of year 9 402 93 985Net sales for the period ending on December 31  2023 decreased to €449k  compared to €617k for the period ending December 31  2022  due to the sale cycle of a specialized instrument such as the Ikoniscope20max  launched in the course of the year. It should be noted that the agreement with Biocare Medical was closed at the end of October 2023 and will be fully developed in the course of 2024.The Company recorded a decrease of the operating expenses. In particular the company cut to more than half G&A expenses  while continuing investing in R&D and Selling expenses. As a reminder  since 2022 the Company started amortizing capitalized R&D expenses for the Ikoniscope20 project. From 2023 the company started amortizing also capitalized R&D for the Ikoniscope20max project. Total D&A in 2023 was equal to 1.26m  while new capitalized R&D expenses for new development projects were equal to €540k.Taking into account the above elements  as of December 31  2023 the operating result amounted to €-2.19m  with an increase of €240k versus 2022 and the net income amounted to €-2.3m as of December 31  2023  with an increase by €180k in comparison to the previous year.The consolidated cash position as of December 31  2023 amounted to €9k  compared to €94k as of December 31  2022.

The improved terms will make it more attractive for investors to participate in the financing of the upcoming Phase 3 trial of oral arsenic trioxide (OATO/ ArsciCor). This new licensing agreements between Medsenic SAS and Phebra Pty Ltd should facilitate the final steps of manufacturing  clinical confirmation of efficacy and subsequent commercialization of our oral arsenic drug in the field of chronic Graft versus Host Disease (cGvHD).The existing License Agreement has been updated and provides a balanced set of terms best suited for the optimal drug manufacturing  clinical development and future commercialization of our oral arsenic trioxide medication (OATO/ArsciCor)  all adapted to the sole indication of cGvHD. The license provides for a royalty on worldwide sales to Phebra  which simplifies and facilitates the terms and conditions for possible sublicensing to future external partners. In addition  under the license agreement  Phebra Pty Ltd. agrees that Medsenic SAS will have exclusive worldwide territorial rights for the use of OATO in GvHD. Commercial arrangements for other indications in the initial Licence Agreement remain unchanged.With respect to the Supply and Commercialization Agreements  Phebra Pty Ltd. remains responsible for maintaining and updating the drug substance file to comply with the regulation of all active territories; of controlling the compliance with various regulatory authorities on ongoing supplier approval and compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) requirements; of updating the drug master file of OATO; of managing the Contract Manufacturing Organization (CMO) and supply chain of the active pharmaceutical ingredient for the clinical release of the product; and of covering the regulatory and quality and GMP expenses.In addition  Medsenic will have the right to establish an Australian entity to use the OATO patents for the cGvHD indication. The Australian entity will not commercially compete with Phebra Pty Ltd.  particularly in the field of APL (acute promyelocytic leukemia) cancer treatment  by producing Medsenic's GvHD treatment in indication-specific packaging.Prof. François Rieger  President of the Board and CEO of the BioSenic Group  said: ”Our collaboration and partnership with Phebra Pty Ltd. – a long term minority shareholder in our group – now leads us to an optimal set of agreements for our licensing and commercialization of the oral formulation of the API arsenic trioxide  OATO/ ArsciCor  which is believed to be favorable for of a smooth development and increased interest from new investors to help make our cGvHD project a success. Our goal is to provide patients with Graft versus Host Disease with a safe  effective and convenient therapeutic solution to treat and control  if not cure  this unmet medical need that occurs after the transplantation of a foreign  functional immune system following the elimination of cancer blood cells. The present radical improvement in the commercial agreement between Phebra Pty Ltd. and Medsenic should facilitate our task of implementing all the necessary funding for the few years of the cGvHD Phase 3 trial. It has already been stated that BioSenic needs a successful cGvHD lead development program: this is key to the company's success  although parallel efforts to develop new indications/therapeutic applications for innovative formulations of ATO can add very significant value.”About BioSenicBioSenic is a leading biotech company specializing in the development of clinical assets issued from its Medsenic’s arsenic trioxide (ATO) platform. Key target indications for the autoimmune platform include graft-versus-host-disease (GvHD)  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  and now systemic sclerosis (SSc).Following the merger in October 2022  BioSenic combined the strategic positionings and strengths of Medsenic and Bone Therapeutics. The merger specifically enables Medsenic/Biosenic to develop an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/oral ATO (OATO).BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About the main Medsenic/BioSenic technology platformThe ATO platform provides derived active products with immunomodulatory properties and fundamental effects on the activated cells of the immune system. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. cGvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT).Medsenic has been successful in a phase 2 trial with its intravenous formulation  Arscimed®  which has orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA. The company is heading towards an international phase 3 confirmatory study  with its new  IP-protected  OATO formulation. Another selected target is moderate-to-severe forms of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae  and the gastrointestinal tract). Systemic sclerosis is now full part of the clinical pipeline of Medsenic/BioSenic. This serious chronic disease badly affects skin  lungs  or vascularization  and has no current effective treatment. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive  giving good grounds to launch a phase 2 clinical protocol  using new immunomodulatory formulations of APIs recognized to be active on the immune system.The company is currently focusing its present R&D and clinical activities on a selective  accelerated development of its autoimmune platform.Note: The allogeneic cell therapy platform-originating from the previous listed company Bone Therapeutics company  may be of renewed interest by using isolated and purified differentiated bone marrow Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) as a starting material for further isolation of passive or active biological subcellular elements. Indeed  these cells may provide new subcellular vesicles potentially able to deliver a unique and proprietary approach to organ repair. BioSenic is now involved in determining new patentable approaches in this complex area of cell therapy.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAFrançois Rieger  PhD  CEOTel: +33 (0)671 73 31 59investorrelations@biosenic.comCertain statements  beliefs and opinions in this press release are forward-looking  which reflect the company or  as appropriate  the company directors’ current expectations and projections about future events.

H1 2024 Highlights The increase in housing output and profitability that the Company has delivered in recent trading periods has continued in the year-to-date  with strong first half-year revenues generated. Market conditions remain very favourable with exceptional demand for our energy-efficient new homes across all buyer profiles  supported by impactful Government initiatives and policies  an improving mortgage market  population growth and record employment. 894 closed units 1 generating revenue of c.€365 million (H1 2023: 535 closed sales and €220 million revenue)  a 66% year-on-year increase in revenue.Successful starter home launches nationwide including at our landmark Seven Mills development and our first developments in Kilkenny (Nyne Park) and Cork (Bayly) respectively.Closed and forward orderbook has increased to c.3 100 new homes with a net sales value of nearly €1.2 billion. This multi-year sales pipeline underpins our medium-term growth targets.Closed our first two forward fund transactions at our mixed tenure developments in Parkside and Seven Mills. These transactions enhance the scale  pace and delivery certainty of apartments and enable us to materially increase the supply of social  affordable and cost rental homes for our State supported counterparties.The Land Development Agency (LDA) has included Cairn in its housebuilder partnership framework panel for Project Tosaigh 2  a programme which is targeting the delivery of 5 000 affordable homes in the near-term.Significant ongoing investment in our business will result in 10 new site commencements in 2024.Retained our A- Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) score  with continued focus on our sustainability strategy across a number of initiatives. We commenced our third scaled Passive House apartment development and are currently building c.1 500 apartments to this internationally recognised building standard.Added a fourth lender  Home Building Finance Ireland (HBFI)  to our increased €327.5 million sustainability-linked syndicate facility (from €277.5 million).Cairn is today announcing a €45 million share buyback programme  which represents €40 million in respect of a new programme and the remaining €5 million of the FY23 programme.

Reaffirming FY24 Guidance Cairn is poised to deliver an exceptional output and financial performance in 2024  and expects to deliver year-on-year growth of c. 30%. The Company reaffirms our FY24 guidance: c.2 200 units 1 ;1 operating profit of c. €145 million; andROE of 15% 2 . Commenting on the H1 2024 trading update  Michael Stanley  Chief Executive Officer  said: “Cairn experienced a very strong spring sales season for first time buyer homes  which has added to our order book of over 3 000 homes. We will grow our output by 30% this year and invest heavily in 10 new site commencements  including eight in the second half of 2024. Recent data on increased mortgage approvals for first time buyers is positive news and the broader homebuilding industry is also responding to improved realisable demand by increasing the supply of new family homes. The current ill-health of the rental market perhaps remains a greater challenge for our economy and growing population. In recent years  more than 70 000 homes previously for private rental are no longer available  the majority having been purchased by homebuyers from smaller landlords exiting the market. Privately funded replacement stock  particularly apartments in urban areas has been very low and as a result  many of Ireland’s young and fully employed population are faced with a shrinking and illiquid rental market.The Government has responded with stronger support for AHBs and the LDA  through CREL funding  resulting in increased commencements of new cost rental apartment developments. A committed implementation of this initiative  together with Croí Cónaithe and student accommodation funding  can significantly boost the delivery of affordable and private scaled apartment developments for both ownership and rental.” The Company will release our 2024 interim results on 4 September 2024.

The agreement is backed by the European Commission’s InvestEU program. Nyxoah plans to use the funding for research and development  and for scaling-up its manufacturing capacity to meet demand in Europe and the U.S.The €37.5 million facility is divided into three tranches: €10 million for the first tranche (“Tranche A”)  €13.75 million for the second tranche (“Tranche B”) and €13.75 million for the third tranche (“Tranche C”). Disbursement under the various tranches is subject to certain conditions. Tranche A carries an annual 5% cash and 5% capitalized interest rate  and features a five-year bullet repayment schedule. The various tranches do not contain revenue or liquidity covenants.In connection with the loan facility agreement  and as a condition to drawdown thereunder  the Company also intends to enter into a “synthetic warrant agreement” with the EIB. Under the intended synthetic warrant agreement  in consideration for the facility  in connection with each tranche of the facility  the EIB will be granted “synthetic warrants” with a duration of 20 years. The number and strike price of the synthetic warrants will be calculated based on tranche specific formulas provided for in the synthetic warrant agreement. The synthetic warrants can be exercised as of the maturity date of the relevant tranche of the facility or  in exceptional situations  earlier. Such synthetic warrants will entitle the EIB to receive from the Company a cash consideration equal to the 20-day volume weighted average price of a share in the Company on the stock exchange  reduced by the applicable strike price per synthetic warrant  and multiplied by the number of synthetic warrants that the EIB exercises. In connection with Tranche A  it is expected that the EIB will be granted 468 384 synthetic warrants with a strike price of €8 11 that the EIB can exercise after the maturity of Tranche A (5 years) or  in exceptional situations  earlier.Since certain provisions of the loan facility agreement and the synthetic warrant agreement are dependent on a change of control  those provisions will be submitted for approval to a shareholders' meeting of the Company in accordance with article 7:151 of the Belgian Companies and Associations Code.EIB Vice-President Robert de Groot said: “Belgium stands at the forefront of innovation in the area of life sciences and med tech. As the EIB  we take pride in supporting this thriving industry and fostering growth. Nyxoah  with its groundbreaking approach  is making a valuable contribution. We are eager to see the company progressing  benefitting patients worldwide.”Olivier Taelman  CEO of Nyxoah  commented: “We are excited and grateful for the support and confidence in our cutting-edge technology shown by the European Investment Bank. This loan follows our recent successful equity offering where we raised €48.5 million  providing us a combined access to over €80 million in growth capital. This will aid in the commercialization of Genio in Europe and in the U.S.  if approved  while helping increase production capacity and sustain innovation.”About NyxoahNyxoah is a medical technology company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative solutions to treat Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA).
