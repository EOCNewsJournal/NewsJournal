The bank's dividends are currently well covered by earnings with a payout ratio of 47.9%  and this trend is expected to continue over the next three years at 48.5%. However  despite recent growth in dividend payments  ABN has a relatively short history of dividend distribution—only eight years—and the payouts have been volatile during this period. Additionally  earnings are projected to decline annually by 11.1% over the next three years  which could pressure future dividends despite current coverage levels. Recent strategic acquisitions aimed at expanding its wealth management footprint in Germany indicate potential for asset growth but also underscore operational risks and integration challenges that could impact profitability and thereby dividend sustainability.ENXTAM:ABN Dividend History as at Jul 2024Simply Wall St Dividend Rating: ★★★★★☆Overview: Acomo N.V. operates in sourcing  trading  processing  packaging  and distributing conventional and organic food ingredients for the food and beverage industry globally  with a market capitalization of approximately €514.16 million.Story continuesOperations: Acomo N.V. generates its revenue primarily through five segments: Tea (€120.62 million)  Edible Seeds (€257.29 million)  Food Solutions (€24.07 million)  Spices and Nuts (€429.96 million)  and Organic Ingredients (€436.38 million).Dividend Yield: 6.6%ACOMO's dividend yield stands at 6.59%  ranking in the top 25% of Dutch dividend payers. Despite a high payout ratio of 85.7%  dividends are supported by earnings and further backed by a cash payout ratio of just 26.1%. However  ACOMO's dividend history over the past decade shows instability with significant annual fluctuations exceeding 20%. Additionally  its financial position is burdened by a high level of debt  which may pose risks to future dividend reliability and growth.ENXTAM:ACOMO Dividend History as at Jul 2024Simply Wall St Dividend Rating: ★★★★☆☆Overview: Koninklijke Heijmans N.V. is a Dutch company involved in property development  construction  and infrastructure projects both domestically and internationally  with a market capitalization of approximately €521.49 million.Operations: Koninklijke Heijmans N.V. generates revenue through its Real Estate  Van Wanrooij  Infrastructure Works  and Construction & Technology segments with earnings of €411.79 million  €124.76 million  €800.03 million  and €1.08 billion respectively.Dividend Yield: 4.5%Koninklijke Heijmans trades at a 9.4% discount to its estimated fair value  with dividends well-covered by earnings and cash flows  showing payout ratios of 37.1% and 59% respectively. While the dividend yield of 4.54% is below the Dutch market's top quartile  HEIJM has increased its dividend payments over the past decade.

Under this agreement  BASF will supply renewable energy certificates (so called “Guarantees of Origin”) to Graphit Kropfmühl’s production site in Hauzenberg  Germany.BASF supports Graphit Kropfmühl  a subsidiary of AMG Critical Materials N.V.  with innovative renewable electricity concept:BASF to supply renewable energy certificates to its supplier and partner Graphit KropfmühlGraphit Kropfmühl to reduce the product carbon footprint (PCF) of graphite produced in Hauzenberg  Germany  by at least 25 percentBASF to use the reduced PCF graphite as raw material for Neopor® with a reduced product carbon footprintA Guarantee of Origin (“GoO”) certifies that a given amount of power was produced in a particular renewable power plant  thus providing a tangible proof of the usage and source of the renewable power. By using these GoOs  the carbon footprint of graphite produced by Graphit Kropfmühl at the Hauzenberg site will be reduced by at least 25 percent. This graphite will then be used by BASF as a raw material for the production of Neopor®  which will therefore also have a lower product carbon footprint. BASF’s Neopor® is used as raw material for insulation products for buildings.“With this innovative concept  we act hand in hand with our customers and beyond the boundaries of our own factory gates to effectively protect the climate. By deepening our collaboration with Graphit Kropfmühl  we are able to accelerate the journey towards net zero together ” said Horatio Evers  Managing Director of BASF Renewable Energy GmbH.Yong Liu  Director of Global Direct Procurement Plastic Additives at BASF  added: “This is a win-win for BASF and Graphit Kropfmühl – a pragmatic approach with a positive impact that will strengthen our long-standing partnership with Graphit Kropfmühl and shows that we are pulling together when it comes to sustainability. Neopor® and Neopor® BMB are solutions with an oustanding insulation performance and sustainability profile. The use of graphite with a reduced product carbon footprint from our partner Graphit Kropfmühl is a consequent further step on our journey to net zero. BASF is also working on further such projects with other partners.”“We are excited to deepen our partnership with BASF by reducing our product carbon footprint (PCF) by at least 25 percent and moving towards a more sustainable future together ” said Thomas Junker  CEO of Graphit Kropfmühl.On its journey towards climate neutrality  BASF has set itself ambitious goals and is striving to achieve net zero CO 2 emissions by 2050. One major lever to achieve these targets is the use of renewable power. BASF has therefore conducted significant investments into renewable power sources over the past years.AMG was founded on the principle that CO 2 abatement targets would create increased criticality for specialty materials. This strategic focus is encapsulated in the company’s Enabled CO 2 Reduction Portfolio concept (“ECO 2 RP”) at the level of AMG’s customers. Its strategic focus is fully aligned with and supports the EU Taxonomy. As a subsidiary of AMG  Graphit Kropfmühl supports the parent company’s commitment to reduce its direct CO 2 emissions by 20 percent from a baseline of 2019 until 2030. This corresponds to a total reduction of 125 000 tons of CO 2 .About BASFAt BASF  we create chemistry for a sustainable future.

Located on the Rennes-Nantes axis  Bain-de-Bretagne benefits from an ideal location for transport and logistics businesses.This new project is underway on a piece of land neighbouring another ARGAN warehouse of 12 000 sq.m rented to CARREFOUR.The future site will welcome the teams of DIMOLOG  a new brand of the DIMOTRANS group that combines the know-how and the manufacturing tools of its three subsidiaries: BSL – BRETAGNE SERVICES LOGISTIQUES  DUHAMEL LOGISTIQUE and DIMOTRANS LOGISTICS. The DIMOLOG flagship counts 900 employees and 30 warehouses.With DIMOLOG  the site will also shelter the growing e-logistics business  thus strengthening the company’s network in the Rennes area  where it already has a strong footprint. This new tool will – in particular – enable the company to help its clients grow.The new logistics platform will be made of three cells for storage representing around 19 000 sq.m  including one that will be used to store flammable liquid. These will be complemented with office blocks of 1 000 sq.m.This Premium site will be Aut0nom®-labelled  i.e.  The Net-Zero ‘in-use’ warehouse. Compared to a standard warehouse  CO 2 emissions are reduced by 90%. Regarding residual emissions  these will be compensated by an ambitious reforestation plan to be deployed in France. The upcoming logistics platform will target a BREEAM Very Good label.The site’s delivery is expected for the beginning of 2025. The land piece provides room for an additional future expansion for 12 000 sq.m of buildable area as part of a second phase  which is currently being marketed with all administrative authorizations being already delivered.The A26 consultancy is involved on architectural aspects and IDEC operates construction works as part of a property development agreement (French CPI).2024 financial calendar (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)July 24: Half-year results 2024October 1: Net sales of 3rd quarter 20242025 financial calendar (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)January 3: Net sales of 4 th quarter 2024quarter 2024 January 16: Annual results 2024March 20: General Assembly 2025About ARGANARGAN is the only French real estate company specializing in the DEVELOPMENT & RENTAL OF PREMIUM WAREHOUSES listed on EURONEXT and is the leading player of its market.

The agreement is backed by the European Commission’s InvestEU program. Nyxoah plans to use the funding for research and development  and for scaling-up its manufacturing capacity to meet demand in Europe and the U.S.The €37.5 million facility is divided into three tranches: €10 million for the first tranche (“Tranche A”)  €13.75 million for the second tranche (“Tranche B”) and €13.75 million for the third tranche (“Tranche C”). Disbursement under the various tranches is subject to certain conditions. Tranche A carries an annual 5% cash and 5% capitalized interest rate  and features a five-year bullet repayment schedule. The various tranches do not contain revenue or liquidity covenants.In connection with the loan facility agreement  and as a condition to drawdown thereunder  the Company also intends to enter into a “synthetic warrant agreement” with the EIB. Under the intended synthetic warrant agreement  in consideration for the facility  in connection with each tranche of the facility  the EIB will be granted “synthetic warrants” with a duration of 20 years. The number and strike price of the synthetic warrants will be calculated based on tranche specific formulas provided for in the synthetic warrant agreement. The synthetic warrants can be exercised as of the maturity date of the relevant tranche of the facility or  in exceptional situations  earlier. Such synthetic warrants will entitle the EIB to receive from the Company a cash consideration equal to the 20-day volume weighted average price of a share in the Company on the stock exchange  reduced by the applicable strike price per synthetic warrant  and multiplied by the number of synthetic warrants that the EIB exercises. In connection with Tranche A  it is expected that the EIB will be granted 468 384 synthetic warrants with a strike price of €8 11 that the EIB can exercise after the maturity of Tranche A (5 years) or  in exceptional situations  earlier.Since certain provisions of the loan facility agreement and the synthetic warrant agreement are dependent on a change of control  those provisions will be submitted for approval to a shareholders' meeting of the Company in accordance with article 7:151 of the Belgian Companies and Associations Code.EIB Vice-President Robert de Groot said: “Belgium stands at the forefront of innovation in the area of life sciences and med tech. As the EIB  we take pride in supporting this thriving industry and fostering growth. Nyxoah  with its groundbreaking approach  is making a valuable contribution. We are eager to see the company progressing  benefitting patients worldwide.”Olivier Taelman  CEO of Nyxoah  commented: “We are excited and grateful for the support and confidence in our cutting-edge technology shown by the European Investment Bank. This loan follows our recent successful equity offering where we raised €48.5 million  providing us a combined access to over €80 million in growth capital. This will aid in the commercialization of Genio in Europe and in the U.S.  if approved  while helping increase production capacity and sustain innovation.”About NyxoahNyxoah is a medical technology company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative solutions to treat Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA).

The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has approved Dupixent (dupilumab) as an add-on maintenance treatment for adults with uncontrolled chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) characterized by raised blood eosinophils. Specifically  the approval covers patients already on a combination of an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)  a long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA) and a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA)  or on a combination of a LABA and a LAMA if ICS is not appropriate. The EMA is the first regulatory authority in the world to approve Dupixent for COPD patients. Additional submissions are under review with other regulatory authorities around the world  including in the US  China  and Japan.Tonya WindersPresident & CEO of Global Allergy & Airways Patient PlatformAs a progressive and devastating disease  COPD leads to suffering from breathlessness that limits a person's ability to conduct everyday activities such as walking up the stairs or to the mailbox. Many patients feel marginalized and isolated because of the physical and mental toll of the disease. After more than a decade of limited treatment advancements for those living with uncontrolled COPD  we are now in a new era of disease management for patients and caregivers  and we welcome the addition of innovative  new treatments such as Dupixent to help manage this progressive and irreversible disease.Paul Hudson (NYSE: )Chief Executive Officer at Sanofi (NASDAQ: )Patients with uncontrolled COPD have been waiting for a new treatment approach for many years  so we are thrilled to bring to market the first biologic to target an underlying cause of this devastating disease to reduce COPD exacerbations and improve lung function. With today's approval of Dupixent  we can change the treatment landscape for the more than 200 000 patients throughout the EU living with uncontrolled COPD with raised blood eosinophils. We look forward to working with other regulators around the world as quickly as possible to bring this novel treatment approach to patients in more countries.The approval is based on results from the landmark phase 3 BOREAS and NOTUS studies  which were separately published in The New England Journal of Medicine and evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in adults with uncontrolled COPD with evidence of type 2 inflammation (i.e.  blood eosinophils ‰¥300 cells per Î¼L). All patients were on background maximal standard-of-care inhaled therapy (with nearly all on triple therapy). In terms of efficacy  Dupixent patients in BOREAS (n=468) and NOTUS (n=470) experienced the following  respectively  compared to placebo (BOREAS n=471; NOTUS n=465):30% and 34% reduction in the annualized rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations over 52 weeks  the primary endpoint.Improvements in lung function (pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 ) from baseline by 160 mL and 139 mL at 12 weeks compared to 77 mL and 57 mL. These improvements were observed as early as week 2 and 4 and were sustained at 52 weeks in both studies.) from baseline by 160 mL and 139 mL at 12 weeks compared to 77 mL and 57 mL. These improvements were observed as early as week 2 and 4 and were sustained at 52 weeks in both studies. Improvements in health-related quality of life (statistically significant in BOREAS and nominally significant in NOTUS)  as assessed by the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire.Reductions in exacerbations and improvements in lung function for Dupixent versus placebo were also observed in patients with higher baseline fractional exhaled nitric oxide ( ‰¥20ppb) - an airway biomarker of inflammation “ and across all pre-defined subgroups including smoking status  baseline lung function  and history of exacerbations.Safety results in both studies were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. The most common side effects across indications include injection site reactions  conjunctivitis  conjunctivitis allergic  arthralgia  oral herpes  and eosinophilia. Adverse events more commonly observed with Dupixent ( ‰¥5%) compared to placebo in either COPD study were back pain  COVID-19  diarrhea  headache and nasopharyngitis. Additional adverse reactions of injection site bruising  injection site induration  injection site rash and injection site dermatitis were reported in the COPD studies.George D. Yancopoulos  M.D.  Ph.D.Board Co-Chair  President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron (NASDAQ: )The approval of Dupixent for COPD is a long-awaited turning point for those who struggle to breathe even through the simplest of tasks  while also facing the risk of hospitalization  irreversible health decline and feelings of hopelessness. With this approval  we are proud that Dupixent has the potential to redefine the treatment landscape in yet another disease  as a first-in-class therapy demonstrating unprecedented improvements on exacerbations and lung function  as well as improving health-related quality of life across two large phase 3 trials.About COPDCOPD is a respiratory disease that damages the lungs and causes progressive lung function decline and is the fourth leading cause of death worldwide. Symptoms include persistent cough  excessive mucus production and shortness of breath that may impair the ability to perform routine daily activities  which may lead to sleep disturbances  anxiety  and depression. COPD is also associated with a significant health and economic burden due to recurrent acute exacerbations that require systemic corticosteroid treatment and/or lead to hospitalization. Smoking and exposure to noxious particles are key risk factors for COPD  but even individuals who quit smoking can still develop or continue having the disease. There have been no new treatment approaches approved for more than a decade.About the Dupixent COPD phase 3 study programBOREAS and NOTUS were replicate  randomized  phase 3  double-blind  placebo-controlled studies that evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in adults who were current or former smokers with moderate-to-severe COPD with evidence of type 2 inflammation  as measured by blood eosinophils ‰¥300 cells per µL. The studies enrolled 1 874 patients who were aged 40 to 80 years in BOREAS and 40 to 85 years in NOTUS.During the 52-week treatment period  patients in BOREAS and NOTUS received Dupixent or placebo every two weeks added to a maximal standard-of-care inhaled triple therapy of ICS  LABA and LAMA. Double maintenance therapy  which included LABA and LAMA  was allowed if ICS was not appropriate.The primary endpoint for BOREAS and NOTUS evaluated the annualized rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations. Moderate exacerbations were defined as those requiring systemic steroids and/or antibiotics. Severe exacerbations were defined as those requiring hospitalization; requiring more than a day of observation in an emergency department or urgent care facility; or resulting in death. Key secondary endpoints included change from baseline in lung function (assessed by pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume [FEV 1 ]) at 12 and 52 weeks  change from baseline at 52 weeks in SGRQ total score compared to placebo  and safety.About Sanofi and Regeneron's COPD clinical research programSanofi and Regeneron are motivated to transform the treatment paradigm of COPD by examining the role different types of inflammation play in the disease progression through the investigation of two potentially first-in-class biologics  Dupixent and itepekimab.Dupixent inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL4) and interleukin-13 (IL13) pathways and the program focuses on a specific population of people with evidence of type 2 inflammation. Itepekimab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits interleukin-33 (IL-33)  an initiator and amplifier of broad inflammation in COPD.Itepekimab is currently under clinical investigation in two phase 3 studies  and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.About DupixentDupixent is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL4) and interleukin-13 (IL13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in phase 3 studies  establishing that IL4 and IL13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in more than 60 countries in one or more indications including certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis  eosinophilic esophagitis  prurigo nodularis  chronic spontaneous urticaria  and COPD in different age populations. More than 900 000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical studies involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in phase 3 studies  including chronic pruritus of unknown origin and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About RegeneronRegeneron (NASDAQ: REGN) is a leading biotechnology company that invents  develops and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has approved Dupixent (dupilumab) as an add-on maintenance treatment for adults with uncontrolled chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) characterized by raised blood eosinophils. Specifically  the approval covers patients already on a combination of an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)  a long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA) and a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA)  or on a combination of a LABA and a LAMA if ICS is not appropriate. The EMA is the first regulatory authority in the world to approve Dupixent for COPD patients. Additional submissions are under review with other regulatory authorities around the world  including in the US  China  and Japan.Tonya WindersPresident & CEO of Global Allergy & Airways Patient Platform“As a progressive and devastating disease  COPD leads to suffering from breathlessness that limits a person’s ability to conduct everyday activities such as walking up the stairs or to the mailbox. Many patients feel marginalized and isolated because of the physical and mental toll of the disease. After more than a decade of limited treatment advancements for those living with uncontrolled COPD  we are now in a new era of disease management for patients and caregivers  and we welcome the addition of innovative  new treatments such as Dupixent to help manage this progressive and irreversible disease.”Paul HudsonChief Executive Officer at Sanofi“Patients with uncontrolled COPD have been waiting for a new treatment approach for many years  so we are thrilled to bring to market the first biologic to target an underlying cause of this devastating disease to reduce COPD exacerbations and improve lung function. With today’s approval of Dupixent  we can change the treatment landscape for the more than 200 000 patients throughout the EU living with uncontrolled COPD with raised blood eosinophils. We look forward to working with other regulators around the world as quickly as possible to bring this novel treatment approach to patients in more countries.”The approval is based on results from the landmark phase 3 BOREAS and NOTUS studies  which were separately published in The New England Journal of Medicine and evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in adults with uncontrolled COPD with evidence of type 2 inflammation (i.e.  blood eosinophils ≥300 cells per μL). All patients were on background maximal standard-of-care inhaled therapy (with nearly all on triple therapy). In terms of efficacy  Dupixent patients in BOREAS (n=468) and NOTUS (n=470) experienced the following  respectively  compared to placebo (BOREAS n=471; NOTUS n=465):30% and 34% reduction in the annualized rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations over 52 weeks  the primary endpoint.Improvements in lung function (pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 ) from baseline by 160 mL and 139 mL at 12 weeks compared to 77 mL and 57 mL. These improvements were observed as early as week 2 and 4 and were sustained at 52 weeks in both studies.) from baseline by 160 mL and 139 mL at 12 weeks compared to 77 mL and 57 mL. These improvements were observed as early as week 2 and 4 and were sustained at 52 weeks in both studies. Improvements in health-related quality of life (statistically significant in BOREAS and nominally significant in NOTUS)  as assessed by the St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire.Reductions in exacerbations and improvements in lung function for Dupixent versus placebo were also observed in patients with higher baseline fractional exhaled nitric oxide (≥20ppb) - an airway biomarker of inflammation – and across all pre-defined subgroups including smoking status  baseline lung function  and history of exacerbations.Safety results in both studies were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. The most common side effects across indications include injection site reactions  conjunctivitis  conjunctivitis allergic  arthralgia  oral herpes  and eosinophilia. Adverse events more commonly observed with Dupixent (≥5%) compared to placebo in either COPD study were back pain  COVID-19  diarrhea  headache and nasopharyngitis. Additional adverse reactions of injection site bruising  injection site induration  injection site rash and injection site dermatitis were reported in the COPD studies.George D. Yancopoulos  M.D.  Ph.D.Board Co-Chair  President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron“The approval of Dupixent for COPD is a long-awaited turning point for those who struggle to breathe even through the simplest of tasks  while also facing the risk of hospitalization  irreversible health decline and feelings of hopelessness. With this approval  we are proud that Dupixent has the potential to redefine the treatment landscape in yet another disease  as a first-in-class therapy demonstrating unprecedented improvements on exacerbations and lung function  as well as improving health-related quality of life across two large phase 3 trials.”About COPDCOPD is a respiratory disease that damages the lungs and causes progressive lung function decline and is the fourth leading cause of death worldwide. Symptoms include persistent cough  excessive mucus production and shortness of breath that may impair the ability to perform routine daily activities  which may lead to sleep disturbances  anxiety  and depression. COPD is also associated with a significant health and economic burden due to recurrent acute exacerbations that require systemic corticosteroid treatment and/or lead to hospitalization. Smoking and exposure to noxious particles are key risk factors for COPD  but even individuals who quit smoking can still develop or continue having the disease. There have been no new treatment approaches approved for more than a decade.About the Dupixent COPD phase 3 study programBOREAS and NOTUS were replicate  randomized  phase 3  double-blind  placebo-controlled studies that evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in adults who were current or former smokers with moderate-to-severe COPD with evidence of type 2 inflammation  as measured by blood eosinophils ≥300 cells per µL. The studies enrolled 1 874 patients who were aged 40 to 80 years in BOREAS and 40 to 85 years in NOTUS.During the 52-week treatment period  patients in BOREAS and NOTUS received Dupixent or placebo every two weeks added to a maximal standard-of-care inhaled triple therapy of ICS  LABA and LAMA. Double maintenance therapy  which included LABA and LAMA  was allowed if ICS was not appropriate.The primary endpoint for BOREAS and NOTUS evaluated the annualized rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations. Moderate exacerbations were defined as those requiring systemic steroids and/or antibiotics. Severe exacerbations were defined as those requiring hospitalization; requiring more than a day of observation in an emergency department or urgent care facility; or resulting in death. Key secondary endpoints included change from baseline in lung function (assessed by pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume [FEV 1 ]) at 12 and 52 weeks  change from baseline at 52 weeks in SGRQ total score compared to placebo  and safety.About Sanofi and Regeneron’s COPD clinical research programSanofi and Regeneron are motivated to transform the treatment paradigm of COPD by examining the role different types of inflammation play in the disease progression through the investigation of two potentially first-in-class biologics  Dupixent and itepekimab.Dupixent inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL4) and interleukin-13 (IL13) pathways and the program focuses on a specific population of people with evidence of type 2 inflammation. Itepekimab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits interleukin-33 (IL-33)  an initiator and amplifier of broad inflammation in COPD.Itepekimab is currently under clinical investigation in two phase 3 studies  and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.About DupixentDupixent is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL4) and interleukin-13 (IL13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in phase 3 studies  establishing that IL4 and IL13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in more than 60 countries in one or more indications including certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis  eosinophilic esophagitis  prurigo nodularis  chronic spontaneous urticaria  and COPD in different age populations. More than 900 000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Sanofi and Regeneron under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical studies involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Sanofi and Regeneron are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in phase 3 studies  including chronic pruritus of unknown origin and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.About RegeneronRegeneron (NASDAQ: REGN) is a leading biotechnology company that invents  develops and commercializes life-transforming medicines for people with serious diseases.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi today announced that the European Commission (EC) has approved Dupixent® (dupilumab) as an add-on maintenance treatment for adults with uncontrolled chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) characterized by raised blood eosinophils. Specifically  the approval covers patients already on a combination of an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)  a long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA) and a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA)  or on a combination of a LABA and a LAMA if ICS is not appropriate. The EC is the first regulatory authority in the world to approve Dupixent for COPD patients. Additional submissions are under review with other regulatory authorities around the world  including in the U.S.  China and Japan.“As a progressive and devastating disease  COPD leads to suffering from breathlessness that limits a person’s ability to conduct everyday activities such as walking up the stairs or to the mailbox. Many patients feel marginalized and isolated because of the physical and mental toll of the disease ” said Tonya Winders  President and Chief Executive Officer at Global Allergy & Airways Patient Platform. “After more than a decade of limited treatment advancements for those living with uncontrolled COPD  we are now in a new era of disease management for patients and caregivers  and we welcome the addition of innovative  new treatments such as Dupixent to help manage this progressive and irreversible disease.”“The approval of Dupixent for COPD is a long-awaited turning point for those who struggle to breathe even through the simplest of tasks  while also facing the risk of hospitalization  irreversible health decline and feelings of hopelessness ” said George D. Yancopoulos  M.D.  Ph.D.  Board Co-Chair  President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron  and a principal inventor of Dupixent. “With this approval  we are proud that Dupixent has the potential to redefine the treatment landscape in yet another disease  as a first-in-class therapy demonstrating unprecedented improvements on exacerbations and lung function  as well as improving health-related quality of life across two large Phase 3 trials.”The approval is based on results from the landmark Phase 3 BOREAS and NOTUS trials  which were separately published in the New England Journal of Medicine and evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in adults with uncontrolled COPD with evidence of type 2 inflammation (i.e.  blood eosinophils ≥300 cells per μL). All patients were on background maximal standard-of-care inhaled therapy (with nearly all on triple therapy). In terms of efficacy  Dupixent patients in BOREAS (n=468) and NOTUS (n=470) experienced the following  respectively  compared to placebo (BOREAS n=471; NOTUS n=465):30% and 34% reduction in the annualized rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations over 52 weeks  the primary endpoint.Improvements in lung function (pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 ) from baseline by 160 mL and 139 mL at 12 weeks compared to 77 mL and 57 mL. These improvements were observed as early as week 2 and 4 and were sustained at 52 weeks in both trials.) from baseline by 160 mL and 139 mL at 12 weeks compared to 77 mL and 57 mL. These improvements were observed as early as week 2 and 4 and were sustained at 52 weeks in both trials. Improvements in health-related quality of life (statistically significant in BOREAS and nominally significant in NOTUS)  as assessed by the St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ).Reductions in exacerbations and improvements in lung function for Dupixent versus placebo were also observed in patients with higher baseline fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO; ≥20ppb) – an airway biomarker of inflammation – and across all pre-defined subgroups including smoking status  baseline lung function and history of exacerbations.Safety results in both trials were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. The most common side effects across indications include injection site reactions  conjunctivitis  conjunctivitis allergic  arthralgia  oral herpes and eosinophilia. Adverse events more commonly observed with Dupixent (≥5%) compared to placebo in either COPD trial were back pain  COVID-19  diarrhea  headache and nasopharyngitis. Additional adverse reactions of injection site bruising  injection site induration  injection site rash and injection site dermatitis were reported in the COPD trials.“Patients with uncontrolled COPD have been waiting for a new treatment approach for many years  so we are thrilled to bring to market the first biologic to target an underlying cause of this devastating disease to reduce COPD exacerbations and improve lung function ” said Paul Hudson  Chief Executive Officer at Sanofi. “With today’s approval of Dupixent  we can change the treatment landscape for the more than 200 000 patients throughout the EU living with uncontrolled COPD with raised blood eosinophils. We look forward to working with other regulators around the world as quickly as possible to bring this novel treatment approach to patients in more countries.”About COPDCOPD is a respiratory disease that damages the lungs and causes progressive lung function decline  and is the fourth leading cause of death worldwide. Symptoms include persistent cough  excessive mucus production and shortness of breath that may impair the ability to perform routine daily activities  which may lead to sleep disturbances  anxiety and depression. COPD is also associated with a significant health and economic burden due to recurrent acute exacerbations that require systemic corticosteroid treatment and/or lead to hospitalization. Smoking and exposure to noxious particles are key risk factors for COPD  but even individuals who quit smoking can still develop or continue having the disease. There have been no new treatment approaches approved for more than a decade.About the Dupixent COPD Phase 3 Trial ProgramBOREAS and NOTUS were replicate  randomized  Phase 3  double-blind  placebo-controlled trials that evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in adults who were current or former smokers with moderate-to-severe COPD with evidence of type 2 inflammation  as measured by blood eosinophils ≥300 cells per µL. The trials enrolled 1 874 patients who were aged 40 to 80 years in BOREAS and 40 to 85 years in NOTUS.During the 52-week treatment period  patients in BOREAS and NOTUS received Dupixent or placebo every two weeks added to a maximal standard-of-care inhaled triple therapy of ICS  LABA and LAMA. Double maintenance therapy  which included LABA and LAMA  was allowed if ICS was not appropriate.The primary endpoint for BOREAS and NOTUS evaluated the annualized rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations. Moderate exacerbations were defined as those requiring systemic steroids and/or antibiotics. Severe exacerbations were defined as those requiring hospitalization; requiring more than a day of observation in an emergency department or urgent care facility; or resulting in death. Key secondary endpoints included change from baseline in lung function (assessed by pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume [FEV 1 ]) at 12 and 52 weeks  change from baseline at 52 weeks in SGRQ total score compared to placebo  and safety.About Regeneron and Sanofi’s COPD Clinical Research ProgramRegeneron and Sanofi are motivated to transform the treatment paradigm of COPD by examining the role different types of inflammation play in the disease progression through the investigation of two potentially first-in-class biologics  Dupixent and itepekimab.Dupixent inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and the program focuses on a specific population of people with evidence of type 2 inflammation. Itepekimab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits interleukin-33 (IL-33)  an initiator and amplifier of broad inflammation in COPD.Itepekimab is currently under clinical investigation in two Phase 3 trials and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.About DupixentDupixent  which was invented using Regeneron’s proprietary VelocImmune® technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in more than 60 countries in one or more indications including certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis  eosinophilic esophagitis  prurigo nodularis  chronic spontaneous urticaria  and COPD in different age populations. More than 900 000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.About Regeneron's VelocImmune® TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder  President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create a substantial proportion of all original  FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes REGEN-COV® (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Dupixent  Libtayo® (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent® (alirocumab)  Kevzara® (sarilumab)  Evkeeza® (evinacumab-dgnb)  Inmazeb® (atoltivimab  maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn) and Veopoz™ (pozelimab-bbfg).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including chronic pruritus of unknown origin  and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. INDICATIONSDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe eczema (atopic dermatitis or AD) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies.

This second rebuttal  underpinned by publicly available documents  of MW's unfounded and misleading allegations focusses on the matters of greatest importance to shareholders  bondholders  employees and other stakeholders as per Eurofins management's discussions with them since 25 June 2024 and covers especially allegations made which related to the last 10 years. Eurofins continues to access archives regarding older facts cited with errors by MW and will consider formulating additional documented rebuttals at a later stage.In addition  the way that MW has shared self-contained and purely subjective opinions regarding Eurofins as part of this public campaign does not allow for an appropriate shareholder dialogue and the delivery of clear and correct information to the market. MW has never initiated a dialogue with Eurofins to discuss their assessments  which could have prevented the spread of incorrect and misleading information.Allegations made by MW are listed below  referencing the pages in its report where the allegation is made. Eurofins' responses are supported by references and links to publicly available information as well as documents available on the Investors section of the Eurofins website under the tab Eurofins response to MW accessible here and organised in appendices according to the numbering below.1. MW allegations: Eurofins' Possibly Too-Good-to-be-True Metrics (referring to revenues per employee) (p. 21) and Eurofins' Questionable CapEx Give Rise to Concerns about Malfeasance  Possibly Including Covering a Cash Hole (p. 23).Eurofins response: This false statement demonstrates MW's complete lack of understanding of Eurofins and its activities. The peer group of 3 TIC companies chosen by MW is neither representative of the analytical services provided by our network of laboratories nor of Eurofins' much more limited presence in Asia  especially China.Eurofins' activities in terms of revenues per employee ( €115k/employee) are clearly in the middle of the range among these more scientifically advanced testing services peers like Charles River ( €175k/employee)  Labcorp ( €168k/employee) and Synlab ( €98k/employee). A 45% mix of the average of Charles River's and Labcorp's primarily US-based revenues and employees ( €171k/employee) and 55% of Synlab's ( €98k/employee) Europe-based revenues and employees equates to a proxy of ca. €130k/ revenues per employee vs 115k € for Eurofins. In terms of capex/revenues  Eurofins (8.3%) is very comparable to Charles River (7.7%).Supporting documents are available under Appendix 1 on the webpage mentioned at the top of this press release.2. MW allegation: Eurofins' Cash Accounting Seems Designed to Maximize Confusion and Inaccuracy “ if Not Outright Overstatement (p. 10).Eurofins response: This is false  misleading and defamatory. Cash is audited each year by Deloitte and the auditors of all Eurofins local operating companies by direct confirmations from banks. There is thus no doubt about Eurofins' cash position at 31 December 2023. However unnecessary that might be  Eurofins is considering mandating a reputed international accounting firm to perform an additional independent audit of Eurofins cash pooling arrangements and cash situation in its consolidated financial statement as of 31 December 2023.3. MW allegation: Eurofins Buys Real Estate from a Questionable Seller Who Was Possibly a Straw Intermediary (p. 27).Eurofins response: MW demonstrates its lack of a serious approach by making many unsubstantiated statements. JMW Solicitors LLP  who acted for Eurofins and its SPV  Southern Real Estate Investment UK Ltd  on its acquisition of Permitted Developments Investment Limited (PDI) 1 Dukes Green Avenue Feltham  has provided Eurofins a letter that states the following:There is no link between the former shareholders of PDI and Eurofins. The transaction was conducted on an arm's length basis  fully negotiated between independently advised parties. The selling shareholders were not acting as straw men and are serial investors in similar property developments for the purpose of residential property. Contrary to the incorrect statement in the MW report  the registered and business address of PDI only became I54 Business Park  Wolverhampton after Eurofins had acquired PDI on 12 August 2019 as part of normal good corporate practice. The purchase price stated in the MW report of £15m is factually incorrect. Eurofins acquired PDI for a total consideration of £13.9m.Supporting documents are available under Appendix 3 on the webpage mentioned at the top of this press release.4. MW allegation: In 2016  Dr. Martin effectively gifted Holstebro to Mr. Linde (NYSE: ) for DKK 1. (p. 19).Eurofins response: Both Dr Martin and Mr Linde lost money investing in a building to support Eurofins Denmark's development in Holstebro. The Holstebro building in Denmark leased to Eurofins Denmark starting July 2006 was owned by Holstebro Invest  a subsidiary of Analytical Bioventures SCA (ABSCA)  which is controlled by Dr Gilles Martin. As can be confirmed from public filings of its accounts  Holstebro Invest never paid a dividend or transferred any funds to Analytical Bioventures SCA (ABSCA) or any entity related to Dr Martin. In 2014  Eurofins Denmark decided to vacate the site and terminated the lease effective September 2016. Absent any third-party buyer or tenant  Linde Holding  owned by Svend Aage Linde  who resides in Denmark and was in a better position to find a use for the building  offered to take over Holstebro Invest for a purchase price of DKK 1 and assumed its debt and other obligations of ca. DKK 18.5m in October 2016  as shown on p. 9 of the Holstebro Invest statutory audit report for 2016. Unfortunately  Holstebro Invest was unable to find a tenant and ultimately in 2022 disposed of the building for a price of DKK 7m as shown on p. 1 of the Deed of sale “ extract of land registry 2022. Ultimately  Linde Holding realised a net loss of ca. DKK 12m on its investment  equivalent to a loss of over €1.5m. Not only did Dr Martin  through ABSCA  not make any profit from this rental to Eurofins or generate any return from its invested capital in Holstebro Invest but ABSCA ended up losing 100% of its invested capital in Holstebro Invest ( €670k). Likewise  Mr Linde did not benefit from this transaction  but to the contrary lost over €1.5m.Supporting documents mentioned above are available under Appendix 4 on the webpage mentioned at the top of this press release.5. MW allegation: For Two Decades  Dr Martin Has Siphoned Money from Eurofins to Build His Commercial Real Estate Portfolio (p. 4).Eurofins response: This is a baseless  defamatory and misleading statement that completely overlooks the corporate governance processes and history of the Company.Eurofins has already confirmed in multiple annual reports and publications that related party lease transactions are conducted at arm's length as can be assessed with comparable transactions and assessments by independent valuation specialists. Furthermore  since June 2017  a Sustainability and Corporate Governance Committee of the Eurofins Board has been set up to independently assess these related party transactions. It is composed only of independent directors. Statement by Patrizia Luchetta  Chair of the Sustainability and Corporate Governance Committee of the Eurofins Board of Directors: I confirm that the lease terms for all properties with ongoing leases with related parties in 2023 or continuing in 2024 have been assessed by the Sustainability and Corporate Governance Committee  as required by Company's Corporate Governance Charter (section 1.1.1 of the Corporate Governance section of Eurofins 2023 Annual Report)  as market conform and at arm's length terms based on both independent third-party valuations and published benchmarks of rental cost per sqm for third-party leases. At the end of 2023  Eurofins occupied a total of about 1.73m sqm of net floor area  thereof ca. 240k (13.9% of total) being rented from related parties and ca. 944k sqm (54.4% of total) being rented from third-party landlords (p. 217 of the Eurofins 2023 Annual Report). The annualised rent per sqm for sites leased from related parties stood at €146 (for total rent payments in 2023 of ca. €35m)  in line with those leased from third parties which stands at €144 (p. 217 of the Eurofins 2023 Annual Report). When comparing laboratory sites  only (90% of the surfaces leased from related parties) in countries where lease agreements are made with both third-party landlords and related parties  the annualised rent per sqm for sites leased from third parties stands at €165  whereas those leased from related parties stands at €149 (p. 217 of the Eurofins 2023 Annual Report ) . In the last ten years  there was no M&A transaction that resulted in ABSCA/Dr Martin and their related parties buying the land or building from the acquisition target or sellers and leasing it back to Eurofins. Furthermore  it should be noted that Eurofins has completed more than 360 acquisitions in the past ten years (2014-2023) without any new related-party lease agreement in connection with such acquisitions. Since 2018  related-party real estate transactions only concern either the renewal of ongoing leases or situations where a Eurofins tenant desires to expand its presence on an existing ABSCA-owned campus with only one minor exception for Eurofins offices in Luxembourg where ABSCA accommodated the needs of Eurofins to reduce its area over time (from 2 595 sqm in 2013 to 869 sqm in 2024). Since 2019  Eurofins has expanded the number of strategic sites it owns  directly acquired from third parties  increasing the surface area of its owned sites from ca. 240k sqm at the end of 2018 (p. 68 of the Eurofins 2018 Annual Report) to ca. 550k sqm at the end of 2023 (+129%) (p. 217 of the Eurofins 2023 Annual Report ) . Allegations by MW regarding older transactions are disputed too and complementary responses based on additional evidence currently sought in Eurofins archives may be provided down the line. To cite one example on which MW puts particular focus on with a whole 2 pages (pp. 33-34) of Appendix B in its report dedicated to this: AvTech. MW again gets its facts wrong which makes the rest of its discussion and conclusions on that property also wrong. One building was purchased upon Eurofins' acquisition in 2005 of AvTech at a price assessed to be at arm's length at the time. The expansion of the space rentable to AvTech was initiated immediately after  and the works were completed in 2006 and paid for by ABSCA. The size of the rentable space was doubled by these building works and ABSCA investments. The mortgage cited by MW financed not only the acquisition of the initial building but also the buildout performed in 2006. The mortgage value is thus not comparable to the price paid for the initial building and as a result the calculation of a loan to value of 165% by MW is massively wrong too. ABSCA financed the development of this building so Eurofins could use its resources to expand organically and through acquisitions at a time its access to capital and credit was much more limited (as a reminder  this was 19 years ago and Eurofins' revenues were only €176m in 2004  €233m in 2005 and €368m in 2006).6. MW allegation: Potential Slip-Up: 2022 Acquisition of BioSantÃ© in Martinique for a Reported ~ €81m (p. 25).Eurofins response: MW does not seem to understand Eurofins nor its markets as a comparison with a tourism company does not reflect the reality of Eurofins' business. BioSantÃ© is a network of clinical blood testing laboratories covering close to half of the tests performed by independent laboratories in the French overseas department of Martinique. Under Appendix 6 on the webpage mentioned at the top of this press release  Eurofins is providing a summary of transactions by parties  excluding Eurofins  of companies active in clinical diagnostics mainly in France  Belgium and Italy  for the period from 2020 to 2022  referencing publicly available documents and press articles. These transactions have enterprise value to revenues ratios of 2.8x to 6.1x. The list includes the acquisition of Biolab Martinique by Cerba in November 2022 at an enterprise value to revenues ratio of 3.1x. This transaction occurred one month after Eurofins completed its acquisition of BioSantÃ© in October 2022 at an enterprise value to revenues ratio of 3.6x. It should also be noted that reimbursements by the French state CNAM to clinical laboratories in Martinique (B=0.29) are 16% higher than the reimbursements for the same test in Metropolitan France (B=0.25) as decreed in the national convention organising relations between directors of private medical analysis laboratories and health insurance as described on pp. 2-3 under Appendix 6 on the webpage mentioned at the top of this press release. Since its acquisition by Eurofins  BioSantÃ© has performed well and it is Eurofins management's opinion that it will deliver expected returns. The EBITDA multiple quoted by MW was calculated using a pre-acquisition EBITDA burdened by sellers' expenses and remunerations that are no longer relevant and thus is not comparable to BioSantÃ©˜s EBITDA under the management of Eurofins.7. MW allegation: One of the oddities is that as Eurofins becomes larger  it's increasingly interested in smaller acquisitions. (p. 23).Eurofins response: This wrong statement shows once again the aggressivity of MW and its desire to disrupt the market with misleading short judgments. There are many economically and strategically rational reasons why the average revenue of companies acquired by Eurofins varies over time and was lower in 2023:Between 2015 and 2018  to build out a platform that could best harness economies of scale  Eurofins pursued an acquisition strategy of acquiring sizable companies such as Bio-Access  Megalab  Covance Food Solutions  TestAmerica and EAG Laboratories. Eurofins only acquires companies if they meet its strenuous economic and strategic criteria. The average size of companies acquired varies depending on which opportunities become available in a given year that meet Eurofins criteria including management and governance  reputation  quality  price and  in particular  return on capital employed. Despite the ongoing consolidation process  Eurofins still operates in many regions and activity segments utilising a large number of smaller local laboratories carrying out time critical assays or assays meeting specific local requirements. Given the more uncertain economic climate and mismatch in price expectations of many sellers of larger companies in a higher interest rate environment  Eurofins has been focussed on reasonably valued bolt-on deals  with supporting data available under Appendix 7 on the webpage mentioned at the top of this press release. Since smaller deals tend to have more favourable valuations  they have recently been more attractive to Eurofins from a return on capital employed perspective compared to larger acquisitions. Moreover  Eurofins now has local teams in many more countries that are capable of integrating smaller acquisitions. The average size of acquisitions may increase again in the future depending on companies that become available at acceptable multiples and meet Eurofins' returns objectives.8. MW allegation: Eurofins' Long History of Confusing Cash Disclosures and Complexity (p. 14) referencing Deloitte's 2023 reclassification of balance sheet accounts of ~ €682 million (p. 14)Eurofins response: This statement is baseless and misleading. The technical restatement done in the FY22 statutory accounts of Eurofins International Holdings Lux SÃ rl is not linked to cash pools but is linked to intercompany accounts receivable and accounts payable positions with other Group companies which were not netted initially  and which were netted in the amended version. As it related to intercompany positions that are fully eliminated in consolidation  this restatement had no impact on Group IFRS consolidated financial statements. The revised audit report for this subsidiary of Eurofins and duly signed by Deloitte is available under Appendix 8 on the webpage mentioned at the top of this press release.9. MW allegation: Eurofins Has Had a Loose Internal Financial Reporting System Primarily Based on Spreadsheets (p. 17)Eurofins response: This is a false statement. Eurofins utilises well recognised standard finance applications such as:Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) Dynamics and Microsoft Great Plains for accounting platforms in Europe and North America with a coverage of ca. 90% of its activitiesIBM (NYSE: ) Cognos Controller and ™1 for consolidation  budgeting and monthly financial reporting  with a coverage of ca. 100% of its activities(NYSE: ) Cognos Controller and ™1 for consolidation  budgeting and monthly financial reporting  with a coverage of ca. 100% of its activities Coupa P2P solution for all third-party purchases  with a coverage of over 90% of purchasing spendThanks to these systems  every single business leader has access to his/her budget and monthly and quarterly financials via an automated internal portal. They can also request support from the business controllers and/or National Service Centres covering their scope. Leaders and controllers can of course use spreadsheets to analyse data extracted from accounting systems  but they cannot change accounting data logged in finance applications.Furthermore  as disclosed in its 2023 Annual Report on p. 216  to ensure a high degree of internal control in a decentral organisation  Eurofins has been commissioning  for more than two decades  local statutory and independent audits for all its operating subsidiaries worldwide  even where not required by law. Results and findings from these local statutory and independent audits are monitored centrally and reported to the Audit and Risk Committee of the Eurofins Board of Directors so that Eurofins can continuously strengthen its internal controls.10. MW allegation: There could be cause for concern about whether Eurofins' cash was properly segregated from Dr Martin's entities (p.19)Eurofins response: This false and misleading statement is based on unfounded accusations. There is a full segregation of cash between Eurofins companies and related-party companies. There are no cash pooling agreements or financing arrangements between them. Eurofins goes beyond its legal obligations  in order to ensure reliability and strong control of financial statements  by commissioning local statutory and independent audits on all its subsidiaries  as stated on p. 216 of Eurofins 2023 Annual Report. As part of these audits  there is a systematic audit of cash in all Eurofins companies by Tier 1 or Tier 2 auditing firms.11. MW allegation: Eurofins' Governance is Optimized for Malfeasance: Seemingly Co-Opted Executives and a Weak Board (p.19)Eurofins response: This statement is baseless  misleading and defamatory. Only 3 out of 8 Board members are members of the Martin family. The remaining 5 members are independent and form a majority (63%). None of the members of the Martin family sit in Board committees. Independent non-executive directors are all highly qualified individuals  including Pascal Rakovsky (former audit partner and audit practice leader at PwC Luxembourg)  Evie Roos (former CHRO at SES)  Ivo Rauh (former member of the executive Board at DEKRA  one of the largest TIC companies in the world)  Patrizia Luchetta (former Head of Life Sciences and New Technologies Directorate at the Luxembourg Ministry of Economy and Trade) and Dr Erica Monfardini (former Director of Global Pharma and Strategic Partnerships at B Medical Systems and former Director of Administration and Finance of the University of Luxembourg).12. MW allegation: Eurofins' Long History of Confusing Cash Disclosures and Complexity (p. 14) referencing a string of questionable cash accounting disclosures that we believe are likely misstatements in the Company's cash balances (p. 14)Eurofins response: This statement is also totally unfounded and misleading. The change in the definition of cash and cash equivalents was made to better reflect the requirement of IFRS 9 regarding net investment hedge. This applies to cash pools held in foreign currencies in Luxembourg  where FX variations would be booked in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income like other FX translations gains and losses.13. MW allegation: Eurofins' Governance is Optimized for Malfeasance: Seemingly Co-opted Executives and a Weak Board (p. 19) referencing Mr Svend Aage Linde (p. 19) and Mr Florian Heupel (pp. 19-20)Eurofins response: No Eurofins executive receives informal compensation. It has been sufficiently demonstrated earlier in this press release with accessible public filings that Mr Linde and Dr Martin (via ABSCA) did not benefit from the Holstebro building related-party transaction but rather that both were acting as supporters of Eurofins' expansion in Denmark and privately lost significant amounts of money in doing so. There was never certainty that any investments by ABSCA in buildings to be rented to Eurofins  at times when Eurofins' balance sheet would not allow the additional debt required for Eurofins to own these buildings  would be guaranteed to yield a profit. Those were not riskless investments as alleged by MW. The very transaction cited by MW clearly demonstrates the risks inherent in such investments for Dr Martin and subsequently for Mr Linde. MW's statement that Mr Linde received informal remuneration from Dr Martin could not be further from the truth.MW alleges that Dr Heupel's independence would be affected by a role held as an independent board member of a Luxembourg fund controlled by Patrizia Asset Management (Patrizia). With €57bn in assets under management  Patrizia is totally unrelated to Eurofins or its management. After thorough investigations in Eurofins purchasing and real estate databases  Eurofins found no evidence supporting the accuracy of the quote from anonymous source G (p. 20 of MW report  footnote 47) that Patrizia reportedly has both served as a landlord to Eurofins and sold properties to Eurofins (p. 20 of MW report). In particular  Eurofins found no single trace of Patrizia being either a landlord or having sold real estate to Eurofins. For good order  further investigations will be carried out. In any case  decisions regarding real estate are made by leaders of Eurofins operating companies around the world under the oversight of Eurofins' real estate function. Dr Heupel does not belong to this function nor can he influence decision-making regarding real estate by Eurofins companies. Also  any remuneration he may have received from Patrizia for his non-executive directorship in one of Patrizia's over 100 Luxembourg funds is not related to Eurofins or Dr Martin. MW allegations are here again unfounded.Comments from the CEO  Dr Gilles Martin:With this additional rebuttal  we have provided clear explanations  direct evidence accessible from public reference sources and supportive data that comprehensively refute Muddy Waters' most significant allegations and suspicions targeting Eurofins and its management that relate to activity in the last 10 years. It is astounding how such a self-serving report containing so many factual errors  misleading and erroneous allegations demonstrating complete ignorance of Eurofins  its markets  and how multinationals and top global auditors operate can be issued by an organisation like MW that alleges to serve society by exposing the truth. It raises the question: is it possible to make so many errors and false hypotheses unintentionally? Going forward  we will work to identify further documentation regarding their other baseless and erroneous claims  many referring to facts dating back 15 to 20 years. We will prioritise areas where more information is requested by our significant long-term shareholders and  where deemed required  conduct forensic investigations involving outside specialists to further prove the unfounded and misleading nature of MW's claims. We are confident that the information contained in both this press release and the documents it cites  and the results of these thorough investigations  will once again unambiguously demonstrate to all the integrity and impartiality with which Eurofins conducts and manages its business. Our employees  bondholders  shareholders and other stakeholders should rest assured that we will continue vigorously defending ourselves against this and any future baseless attacks.In addition to rebuttals made above in items 1-13  below are further considerations that may be obvious for experienced institutional investors but that may not be familiar to individual investors or other stakeholders.On MW's self-serving practices:MW refer to their report as Muddy Waters Research but do not even claim to undertake proper financial research. In its disclaimer which they call Terms of Use they describe their work as only opinion journalism.By merely expressing an opinion  the standard of proof and factual evidence applied to MW publications is very low. In general  any opinions can be wrong with little consequence. To the contrary  financial reports and press releases by companies and the work of auditors are highly regulated and subject to a very high degree of burden of reliability and proof with significant penalties in case of misstatements or errors. These two types of communication cannot be considered to have comparable credibility.The report by MW is presented as opinion journalism and presents almost all assertions and allegations with qualifiers including supposedly  possibly  it seems to us  seems  potential  presumably  appears to  might be  apparently  our view is  it is plausible that  our question is that  it strikes us that it would be easier to  ¦ and subjective words like oddities. Nonetheless  in order to gain credibility  some assertions are presented as facts. Eurofins has amply demonstrated above with reference to publicly available documents  that many of these facts are actually wrong (e.g.  the incorrect date of registration of PDI at the same address as Eurofins Food Testing UK Ltd in Wolverhampton) or simply not relevant to Eurofins (e.g.  the revenues and personnel costs per employee of 3 TIC companies incomparable to Eurofins). MW asserts or implies the existence of potential fraud (e.g.  misstating revenues  personal costs  or cash) but presents no evidence to prove it. It appears that MW expresses opinions with a view to manipulate and serve its purely financial interests.A significant part of the MW report claims to report information derived from interviews with past employees of Eurofins companies. All quotes are anonymous  preventing any analysis of the credibility of the sources to be undertaken or confirmed. Quotes are truncated to such an extent that they lack context and are contradictory in parts. Eurofins has been informed by past employees who participated in similar calls that the questions are often formulated in order to receive the responses desired by the interviewer. One example of such is exposed in a public post by Mr Xavier Dennery who long ago was a member of Eurofins Group Operating Council until March 2011 (see Supplemental Appendix on the webpage mentioned at the top of this press release). It could well be that several of these purportedly journalistic interviews conducted by MW could be interpreted as an attempt to fabricate quotable text to support a foregone conclusion. Interestingly MW appears to cite 10 sources in its footnotes (A B C D G H J K L Q) but a number of sources (E F I M N O P) in the sequence appear to be missing. MW does not disclose how many interviews were actually performed in total and how many interviewees in fact confirmed that Eurofins' practices are ethical  conform to legislation and best practice and whose statements would contradict those parts of interviews which are quoted.The publication by MW was also done soon after market opening but apparently during trading hours on 24 June 2024 and immediately generated very high trading volumes. This raises additional questions.Next steps for Eurofins:Eurofins will systematically address any area of potential concern that its main investors will raise and make results of its investigations public. As always  Eurofins will listen to any well justified suggestion regarding Eurofins' structure  governance and the future state of real estate rented from related parties shared by the majority of its large institutional investors and take these into account in future decisions. Eurofins intends to update the market as progress is made on all these actions.It must also be noted that the MW report was published on the first day of Eurofins' blackout period preceding the 24 July 2024 publication of Eurofins' H1 2024 results  showing MW's eagerness to disrupt the markets. This was definitely not constructive for proper market function  as it prevented Eurofins and its management from altering or issuing new share buyback instructions. After the publication of H1 2024 results  Eurofins intends to consider the trading conditions of Eurofins shares and potentially increase significantly ongoing share buyback programmes. Eurofins is also informed that ABSCA considers setting up such a delegated programme too.Eurofins will also closely liaise with its auditors whose work was also unjustly questioned and with its legal advisors and the relevant regulators to address any unfounded allegations and introduce any actions which may have to be taken to protect investors and prevent further market manipulation.About Eurofins “ the global leader in bio-analysisEurofins is Testing for Life.

(NASDAQ: REGN) and Sanofi (NASDAQ: ) today announced that the European Commission (EC) has approved Dupixent ® (dupilumab) as an add-on maintenance treatment for adults with uncontrolled chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) characterized by raised blood eosinophils. Specifically  the approval covers patients already on a combination of an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS)  a long-acting beta2-agonist (LABA) and a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA)  or on a combination of a LABA and a LAMA if ICS is not appropriate. The EC is the first regulatory authority in the world to approve Dupixent for COPD patients. Additional submissions are under review with other regulatory authorities around the world  including in the U.S.  China and Japan.As a progressive and devastating disease  COPD leads to suffering from breathlessness that limits a person's ability to conduct everyday activities such as walking up the stairs or to the mailbox. Many patients feel marginalized and isolated because of the physical and mental toll of the disease  said Tonya Winders  President and Chief Executive Officer at Global Allergy & Airways Patient Platform. After more than a decade of limited treatment advancements for those living with uncontrolled COPD  we are now in a new era of disease management for patients and caregivers  and we welcome the addition of innovative  new treatments such as Dupixent to help manage this progressive and irreversible disease.The approval of Dupixent for COPD is a long-awaited turning point for those who struggle to breathe even through the simplest of tasks  while also facing the risk of hospitalization  irreversible health decline and feelings of hopelessness  said George D. Yancopoulos  M.D.  Ph.D.  Board Co-Chair  President and Chief Scientific Officer at Regeneron  and a principal inventor of Dupixent. With this approval  we are proud that Dupixent has the potential to redefine the treatment landscape in yet another disease  as a first-in-class therapy demonstrating unprecedented improvements on exacerbations and lung function  as well as improving health-related quality of life across two large Phase 3 trials.The approval is based on results from the landmark Phase 3 BOREAS and NOTUS trials  which were separately published in the New England Journal of Medicine and evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in adults with uncontrolled COPD with evidence of type 2 inflammation (i.e.  blood eosinophils ‰¥300 cells per Î¼L). All patients were on background maximal standard-of-care inhaled therapy (with nearly all on triple therapy). In terms of efficacy  Dupixent patients in BOREAS (n=468) and NOTUS (n=470) experienced the following  respectively  compared to placebo (BOREAS n=471; NOTUS n=465):30% and 34% reduction in the annualized rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations over 52 weeks  the primary endpoint.Improvements in lung function (pre-bronchodilator FEV 1 ) from baseline by 160 mL and 139 mL at 12 weeks compared to 77 mL and 57 mL. These improvements were observed as early as week 2 and 4 and were sustained at 52 weeks in both trials.) from baseline by 160 mL and 139 mL at 12 weeks compared to 77 mL and 57 mL. These improvements were observed as early as week 2 and 4 and were sustained at 52 weeks in both trials. Improvements in health-related quality of life (statistically significant in BOREAS and nominally significant in NOTUS)  as assessed by the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ).Reductions in exacerbations and improvements in lung function for Dupixent versus placebo were also observed in patients with higher baseline fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO; ‰¥20ppb) “ an airway biomarker of inflammation “ and across all pre-defined subgroups including smoking status  baseline lung function and history of exacerbations.Safety results in both trials were generally consistent with the known safety profile of Dupixent in its approved indications. The most common side effects across indications include injection site reactions  conjunctivitis  conjunctivitis allergic  arthralgia  oral herpes and eosinophilia. Adverse events more commonly observed with Dupixent ( ‰¥5%) compared to placebo in either COPD trial were back pain  COVID-19  diarrhea  headache and nasopharyngitis. Additional adverse reactions of injection site bruising  injection site induration  injection site rash and injection site dermatitis were reported in the COPD trials.Patients with uncontrolled COPD have been waiting for a new treatment approach for many years  so we are thrilled to bring to market the first biologic to target an underlying cause of this devastating disease to reduce COPD exacerbations and improve lung function  said Paul Hudson (NYSE: )  Chief Executive Officer at Sanofi. With today's approval of Dupixent  we can change the treatment landscape for the more than 200 000 patients throughout the EU living with uncontrolled COPD with raised blood eosinophils. We look forward to working with other regulators around the world as quickly as possible to bring this novel treatment approach to patients in more countries.About COPDCOPD is a respiratory disease that damages the lungs and causes progressive lung function decline  and is the fourth leading cause of death worldwide. Symptoms include persistent cough  excessive mucus production and shortness of breath that may impair the ability to perform routine daily activities  which may lead to sleep disturbances  anxiety and depression. COPD is also associated with a significant health and economic burden due to recurrent acute exacerbations that require systemic corticosteroid treatment and/or lead to hospitalization. Smoking and exposure to noxious particles are key risk factors for COPD  but even individuals who quit smoking can still develop or continue having the disease. There have been no new treatment approaches approved for more than a decade.About the Dupixent COPD Phase 3 Trial ProgramBOREAS and NOTUS were replicate  randomized  Phase 3  double-blind  placebo-controlled trials that evaluated the efficacy and safety of Dupixent in adults who were current or former smokers with moderate-to-severe COPD with evidence of type 2 inflammation  as measured by blood eosinophils ‰¥300 cells per µL. The trials enrolled 1 874 patients who were aged 40 to 80 years in BOREAS and 40 to 85 years in NOTUS.During the 52-week treatment period  patients in BOREAS and NOTUS received Dupixent or placebo every two weeks added to a maximal standard-of-care inhaled triple therapy of ICS  LABA and LAMA. Double maintenance therapy  which included LABA and LAMA  was allowed if ICS was not appropriate.The primary endpoint for BOREAS and NOTUS evaluated the annualized rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations. Moderate exacerbations were defined as those requiring systemic steroids and/or antibiotics. Severe exacerbations were defined as those requiring hospitalization; requiring more than a day of observation in an emergency department or urgent care facility; or resulting in death. Key secondary endpoints included change from baseline in lung function (assessed by pre-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume [FEV 1 ]) at 12 and 52 weeks  change from baseline at 52 weeks in SGRQ total score compared to placebo  and safety.About Regeneron and Sanofi's COPD Clinical Research ProgramRegeneron and Sanofi are motivated to transform the treatment paradigm of COPD by examining the role different types of inflammation play in the disease progression through the investigation of two potentially first-in-class biologics  Dupixent and itepekimab.Dupixent inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and the program focuses on a specific population of people with evidence of type 2 inflammation. Itepekimab is a fully human monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits interleukin-33 (IL-33)  an initiator and amplifier of broad inflammation in COPD.Itepekimab is currently under clinical investigation in two Phase 3 trials and its safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.About DupixentDupixent  which was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune ® technology  is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the signaling of the interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13) pathways and is not an immunosuppressant. The Dupixent development program has shown significant clinical benefit and a decrease in type 2 inflammation in Phase 3 trials  establishing that IL-4 and IL-13 are key and central drivers of the type 2 inflammation that plays a major role in multiple related and often co-morbid diseases.Dupixent has received regulatory approvals in more than 60 countries in one or more indications including certain patients with atopic dermatitis  asthma  chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis  eosinophilic esophagitis  prurigo nodularis  chronic spontaneous urticaria  and COPD in different age populations. More than 900 000 patients are being treated with Dupixent globally.About Regeneron's VelocImmune ® TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder  President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985  they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse  and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite ® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create a substantial proportion of all original  FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies. This includes REGEN-COV ® (casirivimab and imdevimab)  Dupixent  Libtayo ® (cemiplimab-rwlc)  Praluent ® (alirocumab)  Kevzara ® (sarilumab)  Evkeeza ® (evinacumab-dgnb)  Inmazeb ® (atoltivimab  maftivimab and odesivimab-ebgn) and Veopoz™ (pozelimab-bbfg).Dupilumab Development ProgramDupilumab is being jointly developed by Regeneron and Sanofi under a global collaboration agreement. To date  dupilumab has been studied across more than 60 clinical trials involving more than 10 000 patients with various chronic diseases driven in part by type 2 inflammation.In addition to the currently approved indications  Regeneron and Sanofi are studying dupilumab in a broad range of diseases driven by type 2 inflammation or other allergic processes in Phase 3 trials  including chronic pruritus of unknown origin  and bullous pemphigoid. These potential uses of dupilumab are currently under clinical investigation  and the safety and efficacy in these conditions have not been fully evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. INDICATIONSDUPIXENT is a prescription medicine used:to treat adults and children 6 months of age and older with moderate-to-severe eczema (atopic dermatitis or AD) that is not well controlled with prescription therapies used on the skin (topical)  or who cannot use topical therapies.
