Resolutions to:a) Reduce the share capital with retirement of 19 427 shares held in treasury.b) Increase the share capital through a bonus issue.9. Closing of the Extraordinary General Meeting.Proposals for resolutions to be presented at the Extraordinary General Meeting of Orrön Energy AB on Wednesday 7 August 2024Item 2: Resolutions in respect of Chair of the Extraordinary General MeetingThe Board of Directors proposes that Advokat Klaes Edhall is elected as Chair of the Extraordinary General Meeting or  if he is absent  any other person appointed by the Board of Directors.Item 3: Preparation and approval of the voting registerThe Board of Directors proposes that the register prepared by Computershare AB (on behalf of the Company) based on the Company’s share register  shareholders attending in person or through proxy and postal votes received by the Company is approved as voting register for the Extraordinary General Meeting.Item 7: Resolution in respect of an amendment of the Articles of AssociationThe Board of Directors greatly values all genuine interactions with shareholders of the Company. However  considering the Company’s large international shareholder base  the limited number of physically attending shareholders at the latest General Meetings  and  considering the disruptive and hostile behaviour of a number of shareholders and their advisors at the Annual General Meeting 2024  including health and safety aspects  the Board of Directors believes that it would be beneficial for the Company and its shareholders if the Company had an option to hold General Meetings digitally with remote participation by shareholders. Should the Board of Directors in the future decide that a General Meeting shall be held digitally  it is intended that a “townhall” meeting will be held in close connection with the General Meeting  to allow shareholders an opportunity to meet and ask questions to representatives of the Board of Directors and the Management Team in an orderly manner.The Board of Directors therefore proposes that the Extraordinary General Meeting resolves to amend the Articles of Association by adding the following paragraph as a new last paragraph to article § 11 (Participation at general meetings of shareholders) of the Articles of Association.“The Board of Directors may decide that a general meeting shall be held digitally.”The proposed new Articles of Association are available in their entirety at the Company’s website  www.orron.com.A resolution in accordance with the Board of Directors’ proposal requires the support of shareholders representing at least two thirds (2/3) of the votes cast and of the shares represented at the ExtraordinaryGeneral Meeting.Item 8: Resolution to a) reduce the share capital through cancellation of own shares held in treasury  and b) increase of the share capital through a bonus issueBackgroundThe Company holds 19 427 own shares in treasury as a result of a legacy corporate transaction  and the Board of Directors currently sees no use for this limited number of shares. Consequently  the Board of Directors proposes that the Extraordinary General Meeting resolves to reduce the share capital through cancellation of all 19 427 shares held in treasury and increase the share capital through a bonus issue in accordance with items 8 a) – 8 b) below.Item 8 a): Resolution to reduce the share capital with retirement of 19 427 shares held in treasuryThe Board of Directors proposes that the Extraordinary General Meeting resolves on a reduction of the Company’s share capital with retirement of shares on the following terms.The share capital is to be reduced by SEK 236.36. The reduction of the share capital is to be made with retirement of 19 427 shares that are held in treasury by the Company. The purpose of the reduction of the share capital is allocation to unrestricted equity. Accordingly  the Company will not pay or receive any payment for the retired shares.The Company may implement the resolution to reduce the share capital without authorisation from the Swedish Companies Registration Office or  if disputed  by a Swedish court of general jurisdiction  since the Company simultaneously carries out a bonus issue of SEK 236.36 in accordance with the proposal under item 8 b) below. Combined  the reduction of the share capital pursuant the proposal under this item 8 a) and the increase of the share capital pursuant to item 8 b) result in that neither the Company’s restricted equity nor its share capital is reduced.Item 8 b): Resolution to increase the share capital through a bonus issueThe Board of Directors proposes that the Extraordinary General Meeting resolves to increase the Company’s share capital through a bonus issue on the following terms.The share capital is to be increased by SEK 236.36. No new shares are to be issued in connection with the increase of the share capital. The amount by which the share capital is to be increased shall be transferred to the share capital from unrestricted equity.The purpose of the bonus issue is to restore the Company’s restricted equity and share capital after the reduction of the share capital proposed under item 8 a) above.Majority requirements  etc.The Board of Directors’ proposes that the Extraordinary General Meeting resolves on the proposals under items 8 a) and 8 b) as one joint resolution  since the matters are interrelated. Accordingly  the resolution requires the support of shareholders representing at least two thirds (2/3) of the votes cast and of the shares represented at the Extraordinary General Meeting.Number of shares and votes in the CompanyThe Company’s share capital amounts to SEK 3 478 713.38  represented by 285 924 614 shares. Each share carries one vote. As of the date of this notice  the Company holds 19 427 own shares in treasury.Shareholders’ right to request informationThe Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer shall  if a shareholder so requests and the Board of Directors considers that it may do so without significant damage to the Company  give information at the Extraordinary General Meeting regarding circumstances that could affect the assessment of an item on the agenda.Additional documentationComplete proposals and other documents that shall be made available prior to the Extraordinary General Meeting pursuant to the Swedish Companies Act and the Swedish Corporate Governance Code are available at the Company’s office (Hovslagargatan 5 in Stockholm) and on www.orron.com.

The total capital costs for the project remain in line with previous estimates. On-going detailed engineering and scheduling work has resulted in lower expected capital expenditure in 2024.Works are advancing well for the upgrade  with the fabrication of the two new dredges and the upfront desliming circuit making encouraging progress. Nataka represents over 70% of Moma’s Mineral Resources and unlocking this ore zone secures production for decades to come  whilst maintaining Kenmare’s first quartile position on the industry revenue to cost curve.”OverviewNataka is the largest ore zone in Kenmare’s portfolio  containing 6.4 billion tonnes of Moma’s 9.0 billion tonnes of Mineral Resources. WCP A is the largest of Kenmare’s three mining plants  representing approximately 50% of total mining capacity. WCP A will begin its transition from its current mine path in Namalope  where it has mined for 17 years  to Nataka in late 2025. This is the only move of this kind that is required in WCP A’s economic life  which is expected to extend beyond the existing mine plan that runs to 2045.Kenmare’s Board approved the initial three parts of WCP A’s Definitive Feasibility Study (“DFS”) in 2023  while the DFS relating to infrastructure was completed in Q2 2024. The Infrastructure DFS addresses four key elements:Electricity supply – including a new 110kV overhead powerline from the Mineral Separation Plant (“MSP”) to the Nataka substationPumping and piping – allowing for transportation of slimes from WCP A to the primary densification paddock and ultimately the Tailings Storage Facility (“TSF”)  as well as distributing waterHeavy Mineral Concentrate (“HMC”) handling – including a new terrace for stacking and storage of HMC. HMC will be pumped from WCP A to the infrastructure terrace by pipeline and in the early years of operation  transported to the MSP by roadOther infrastructure – including the new Nataka electricity substation  maintenance workshops for heavy mobile equipment  and officesCapital costsThe total capital cost for the upgrade and transition of WCP A is expected to be in line with previous estimates and totals $341 million. This includes $106 million in respect of WCP A infrastructure (including both base capital expenditure of $88 million and $18 million of the overall project contingency). Kenmare plans to fund the WCP A upgrade and transition from cash flow and existing debt facilities.The breakdown of the total capital costs remains similar to Kenmare’s previous guidance  including contingency of $52 million. The breakdown is as follows:Component Cost estimate in July 2024 Cost estimate in December 2023 New dredges 65 65 Other WCP A upgrades (e.g. upfront desliming circuit) 100 100 TSF 36 36 Nataka infrastructure 88 98 Contingency 521 42 Total 341 341A portion of contingency has been committed.Kenmare began incurring capital expenditure for the WCP A upgrade and transition in 2023  beginning with orders for key long lead time items  such as the two new higher capacity dredges. The capital expenditure incurred to date has been lower than expected and further detailed engineering and scheduling work has deferred $38 million of expected capital expenditure from 2024 into subsequent years  in line with the expected mine plan.Kenmare continues to expect to begin the transition of WCP A to the Nataka ore zone in late 2025.Capital expenditure schedule($m) 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 Total July 2024 11 141 128 40 4 17 341 December 2023 11 179 121 20 10 - 341Project status updateThe WCP A upgrade and transition project consists of three key components  in addition to the infrastructure included in the WCP A Infrastructure DFS  and their current status is as follows:New more powerful dredges – the fabrication of two new higher capacity dredges is progressing with Kenmare’s contractor in the Netherlands Upfront desliming circuit to more effectively manage slimes at Nataka – the fabrication of pontoons and surge bin (parts of the desliming circuit) is underway and the earth works for the starter pond are also in progress Introduction of a TSF to replace the current paddock system – the detailed design of the TSF is progressing well and on schedule for completion in Q3 2024. Construction is expected to begin in Q4 2024Other capital projectsWork continues on both the DFS for the WCP B upgrade  which is expected to increase WCP B’s capacity by over 40%; and the Pre-Feasibility Study for the Congolone ore zone  which is a potential future growth opportunity for the Company. Kenmare expects to provide an update on both studies with the Company’s Interim Results  which will be announced on 14 August 2024.The Company will announce its Q2 and H1 2024 Production Update on 17 July 2024.For further information  please contact:Kenmare Resources plcJeremy Dibb / Katharine Sutton / Michael StarkeInvestor Relationsir@kenmareresources.comTel: +353 1 671 0411Mob: + 353 87 943 0367 / + 353 87 663 0875Murray (PR advisor)Paul O’Kanepokane@murraygroup.ieTel: +353 1 498 0300Mob: +353 86 609 0221About Kenmare ResourcesKenmare Resources plc is one of the world's largest producers of mineral sands products.

This project is funded by the Fren…,Technip Energies (PARIS:TE) in partnership with Université Gustave Eiffel  Valeco  and OPEN-C Foundation  will be leading the PAREF project  an R&D program aimed at accelerating industrial-scale development of floating wind. This project is funded by the French State as part of France 2030 operated by ADEME. It aims to design  fabricate  and test a reusable anchoring system  high and low connectors  and tendons for a tension line system  all while minimizing the impact on the marine environment in real offshore conditions.The PAREF project will provide the anchoring system for the NextFloat project. In 2022  Technip Energies  X1 Wind  and a consortium of 10 international entities were chosen by the European Commission to deliver the NextFloat project. The integrated system includes X1 Wind's innovative and disruptive floating wind technology  featuring a lighter floater design with a reduced steel requirement  plus a compact mooring system minimizing seabed impact. The 6MW prototype will be deployed at a test site in the Mediterranean Sea to operate the concept in open-sea operational conditions.The PAREF project is a significant step towards achieving a competitive and sustainable integrated floating offshore wind solution optimized for deep waters  significantly reducing cost and accelerating industrial-scale deployment. The NextFloat platform will provide the means to test the PAREF foundation system in situ for a minimum of two years.Jacques Vendé  Project manager PAREF of Technip Energies  commented: “We are thrilled to be selected for the PAREF project and to play a role in France's ambition to lead the way in decarbonized and cutting-edge renewable energy technologies  as outlined in the France 2030 plan. This project represents a significant opportunity to advance the development of sustainable energy solutions and support France's green industry vision.”Christelle Abadie  Research fellow at the Université Gustave Eiffel added: “We are excited to contribute our expertise in experimental testing and analysis to the PAREF project. This initiative aligns perfectly with our ongoing activities and ambition to advance the understanding of anchor design for the floating wind energy sector. Collaborating closely with Technip Energies and Open-C is essential for knowledge transfer and a deeper comprehension of anchor design. This project and partnership will help optimize anchor geometry and reduce mooring system costs  facilitating the large-scale deployment of innovative floating wind farm technologies.”Pauline Bertrand  Director of Valeco's Offshore Division: “The PAREF project is also an innovative approach to environmental monitoring. Environmental DNA is a new way of collecting data that can be replicated for any offshore project and we felt it was necessary to test the methodology. Our participation in the PAREF project will increase our knowledge of the marine environment and the species attracted by the floaters. It will also give us the opportunity to work with new players in the Mediterranean to test complex artificial reefs.As our aim has always been to promote and support the development of MRE  we are proud to be involved in this project alongside Technip Energies  Gustave Eiffel University and the Open-C Foundation”.Bertrand Alessandrini  Managing Director of the OPEN-C Foundation commented: “Hosting the PAREF project is at the core of the Foundation’s mission: test and derisk new technologies to accelerate innovation. It is essential to work together to face climate emergency and deliver French and European ambitions in terms of Marine Renewable energies”.About Technip EnergiesTechnip Energies is a leading Engineering & Technology company for the energy transition  with leadership positions in LNG  hydrogen and ethylene as well as growing market positions in blue and green hydrogen  sustainable chemistry and CO 2 management.

This causes major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care  they become ineffective  intolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing ""diureticresistant"" patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  delivering major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients and reducing costs for healthcare systems.The Company's Premarket Approval (PMA) application for the alfapump was submitted to the US FDA in December 2023 and accepted for substantive review in January 2024  having reported positive primary and secondary endpoint data from the North American pivotal POSEIDON study in recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis. US market approval of the alfapump is anticipated before the end of Q1 2025 with US commercial launch planned for H2 2025.Results of the Company's RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure support DSR's mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE  a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study  have been successfully treated with DSR  resulting in a dramatic improvement in diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements. The independent Data Safety Monitoring Board approved the start of the randomized MOJAVE cohort of up to a further 30 patients  which is planned after alfapump US PMA approval. Sequana Medical is listed on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent  Belgium. For further information  please visit www.sequanamedical.com.Important Regulatory DisclaimersThe alfapump® system is currently not approved in the United States or Canada. In the United States and Canada  the alfapump system is currently under clinical investigation (POSEIDON Trial) and is being studied in adult patients with refractory or recurrent ascites due to liver cirrhosis. DSR® therapy is still in development and it should be noted that any statements regarding safety and efficacy arise from ongoing pre-clinical and clinical investigations which have yet to be completed. There is no link between DSR therapy and ongoing investigations with the alfapump system in Europe  the United States or Canada.Note: alfapump® and DSR® are registered trademarks.Forward-looking statementsThis press release may contain predictions  estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking statements.

Despite a high dividend yield of 7.94%  which ranks in the top 25% of French dividend payers  its sustainability is questionable due to a high cash payout ratio of 486.2%. While dividends have been reliable over the past decade  current financial challenges and insufficient cash flow coverage may impact future payouts.Story continuesENXTPA:ALPDX Dividend History as at Jul 2024Simply Wall St Dividend Rating: ★★★★☆☆Overview: Caisse Régionale de Crédit Agricole Mutuel du Languedoc Société coopérative operates as a cooperative bank in France  offering a range of banking products and services to diverse client groups  with a market capitalization of €1.03 billion.Operations: Caisse Régionale de Crédit Agricole Mutuel du Languedoc Société coopérative generates €505.07 million from its retail banking operations in France.Dividend Yield: 5.3%Caisse Régionale de Crédit Agricole Mutuel du Languedoc offers a stable dividend history with a current yield of 5.17%  slightly below the top tier in the French market. Over the past decade  dividends have shown consistent growth and stability  supported by a low payout ratio of 30.9%  indicating good coverage by earnings. However  there's insufficient data to predict dividend sustainability over the next three years or confirm coverage by future cash flows. Trading at 61.2% below estimated fair value suggests potential undervaluation.ENXTPA:CRLA Dividend History as at Jul 2024Simply Wall St Dividend Rating: ★★★★☆☆Overview: Publicis Groupe S.A. is a global provider of marketing  communications  and digital business transformation services with a market capitalization of €25.25 billion.Operations: Publicis Groupe S.A. generates €14.80 billion from its Advertising and Communication Services segment.Dividend Yield: 3.4%Publicis Groupe's dividend yield stands at 3.37%  lower than the French market's top quartile. Despite a 17% increase in its recent dividend to €3.40  the company's decade-long record shows inconsistent dividend payments  reflecting volatility and unreliable growth patterns. Dividends are supported by a payout ratio of 61% from earnings and a cash payout ratio of 45.5%  indicating reasonable coverage by both profits and cash flows. The stock is trading at a significant discount  priced 46.4% below estimated fair value  suggesting potential undervaluation amidst forecasts of annual earnings growth at 6.59%.ENXTPA:PUB Dividend History as at Jul 2024Make It HappenTake a closer look at our Top Euronext Paris Dividend Stocks list of 37 companies by clicking here.Are these companies part of your investment strategy?
