Despite a high dividend yield of 7.94%  which ranks in the top 25% of French dividend payers  its sustainability is questionable due to a high cash payout ratio of 486.2%. While dividends have been reliable over the past decade  current financial challenges and insufficient cash flow coverage may impact future payouts.ENXTPA:ALPDX Dividend History as at Jul 2024Simply Wall St Dividend Rating: ★★★★☆☆Overview: Caisse Régionale de Crédit Agricole Mutuel du Languedoc Société coopérative operates as a cooperative bank in France  offering a range of banking products and services to diverse client groups  with a market capitalization of €1.03 billion.Operations: Caisse Régionale de Crédit Agricole Mutuel du Languedoc Société coopérative generates €505.07 million from its retail banking operations in France.Story continuesDividend Yield: 5.3%Caisse Régionale de Crédit Agricole Mutuel du Languedoc offers a stable dividend history with a current yield of 5.17%  slightly below the top tier in the French market. Over the past decade  dividends have shown consistent growth and stability  supported by a low payout ratio of 30.9%  indicating good coverage by earnings. However  there's insufficient data to predict dividend sustainability over the next three years or confirm coverage by future cash flows. Trading at 61.2% below estimated fair value suggests potential undervaluation.ENXTPA:CRLA Dividend History as at Jul 2024Simply Wall St Dividend Rating: ★★★★☆☆Overview: Publicis Groupe S.A. is a global provider of marketing  communications  and digital business transformation services with a market capitalization of €25.25 billion.Operations: Publicis Groupe S.A. generates €14.80 billion from its Advertising and Communication Services segment.Dividend Yield: 3.4%Publicis Groupe's dividend yield stands at 3.37%  lower than the French market's top quartile. Despite a 17% increase in its recent dividend to €3.40  the company's decade-long record shows inconsistent dividend payments  reflecting volatility and unreliable growth patterns. Dividends are supported by a payout ratio of 61% from earnings and a cash payout ratio of 45.5%  indicating reasonable coverage by both profits and cash flows. The stock is trading at a significant discount  priced 46.4% below estimated fair value  suggesting potential undervaluation amidst forecasts of annual earnings growth at 6.59%.ENXTPA:PUB Dividend History as at Jul 2024Make It HappenTake a closer look at our Top Euronext Paris Dividend Stocks list of 37 companies by clicking here.Are these companies part of your investment strategy?

We are encouraged by the patient characteristics we are seeing in the main cohort of NATiV3 compared to those of our Phase IIb trial and above all by the plateau effect we see in the weight gain curve which confirms the differentiated profile of our panPPAR compound versus single PPAR gamma compounds such as pioglitazone. The data obtained from our various clinical studies demonstrate that lanifibranor could fully address the broad spectrum of the disease and recent presented data at the EASL Liver Congress from other compounds in development further bolster our belief in the potential of oral lanifibranor for use alone or in combination therapy. We are continuing to evaluate financing options to extend our current cash runway and continue our activities as we are determined to bring lanifibranor to market as a treatment option for patients with MASH.”Update on its clinical program evaluating lanifibranor for the treatment of MASHThe recruitment in NATiV3 is advancing with screening ongoing at 347 sites across 19 countries. As of July 5  2024  1 027 patients have been randomized of which 784 patients in the main cohort of NATiV3  representing 82% of the targeted number. The geographical distribution of the main cohort confirms that North America and Western Europe are the key contributors to patient recruitment (67% and 21% respectively) while China has only contributed marginally (2% of patients). The targeted number of 200 patients to be recruited in the exploratory cohort has been met with 243 patients randomized to date. The recruitment in the exploratory will continue until recruitment is complete in the main cohort.The Company estimates that  given the number of patients currently in screening who are eligible for enrolment in the main cohort  the Company must recruit an additional 165 patients. Due to a delay of approximately 3 to 5 months in recruitment  the Company is currently now targeting: the last patient first visit for the second half of 2024 and the publication of the topline results in the beginning of the second half of 2026.The baseline characteristics of the patients enrolled so far in the main cohort are in line with the expectations of the Company and are consistent with those from the NATIVE Phase IIb clinical trial of lanifibranor in patients with MASH/NASH (“NATIVE”). In addition  13% of patients enrolled in the main cohort were receiving a stable dose of GLP1 receptor agonist and 9% a stable dose of SGLT2 inhibitors at baseline and should provide the Company with insights on the potential of the benefits of a combination of these class of products with lanifibranor.Importantly  a blinded review which included 780 patients enrolled in the main cohort of NATiV3 (placebo and treatment arms pooled) showed a similar weight gain as the one observed during the NATIVE Phase IIb trial which seems to plateau and stabilize after 24 to 36 weeks of treatment  and this even in the subgroup of patients who have gained more than 5% weight. If confirmed  this encouraging result highlights the particular profile of lanifibranor versus single PPAR gamma in particular pioglitazone  where such a plateau effect has not been observed1.Intellectual property strategyWe continue to work to reinforce lanifibranor patent portfolio. As of today  lanifibranor patent portfolio is made up of 20 patent families comprising both patents and patent applications fully owned by Inventiva. These patent families are respectively directed to lanifibranor product  method of treatment  combination therapy  process  formulation and diagnostic methods. With our patent family directed to crystalline forms of lanifibranor (patent applications pending)  the company expects to potentially extend protection on lanifibranor product until at least 2043.Financial updateConsidering the Company’s cost structure and forecasted expenditures  and without taking into account additional cash preservation measures that the Company may implement in the short term  the Company estimates that its cash  cash equivalents and deposits will allow the Company to fund its operations as planned through the second half of July 20242. The Company estimates that  as of May 31  2024  the Company’s cash and cash equivalents were (non-audited) €9.6 million  short-term deposits were €0.1 million3  and long-term deposits were €10.0 million4  compared with €26.9 million  €0.01 million and €9 million  respectively  as of December 31  2023.In order to finance its activities and advance its development objectives for its research and development programs  the Company will need to raise additional funds. To date  the Company has explored a variety of transactions  including the issuance of debt  equity and other instruments  which thus far have not been successful. However  the Company is working to complete a royalty-based financing that would extend its cash runway through the summer of 2024  which it anticipates announcing in the near-term. Even if the royalty-based financing is successful (of which there can be no assurance)  the Company will need to raise additional funds  and it is continuing to actively evaluate potential financing (including debt  equity and equity-linked or other instruments) and strategic options.About lanifibranorLanifibranor  Inventiva’s lead product candidate  is an orally-available small molecule that acts to induce antifibrotic  anti-inflammatory and beneficial vascular and metabolic changes in the body by activating all three peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (“PPAR”) isoforms  which are well-characterized nuclear receptor proteins that regulate gene expression. Lanifibranor is a PPAR agonist that is designed to target all three PPAR isoforms in a moderately potent manner  with a well-balanced activation of PPARα and PPARδ  and a partial activation of PPARγ. While there are other PPAR agonists that target only one or two PPAR isoforms for activation  lanifibranor is the only pan-PPAR agonist in clinical development for the treatment of MASH/NASH. Inventiva believes that lanifibranor’s moderate and balanced pan-PPAR binding profile contributes to the favorable tolerability profile that has been observed in clinical trials and pre-clinical studies to date. The FDA has granted Breakthrough Therapy and Fast Track designation to lanifibranor for the treatment of MASH/NASH.About the NATiV3 Phase III trialNATiV3 is a randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled clinical trial designed to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of lanifibranor (800mg/daily and 1200mg/daily) in adult patients with biopsy-proven non-cirrhotic MASH/NASH and F2/F3 stage of liver fibrosis. The trial takes place in 24 countries and in more than 400 clinical sites and recruits approximately 900 patients to be treated over a 72-week period. The effect of lanifibranor will be assessed on several histological endpoints  including MASH/NASH resolution and improvement of fibrosis of at least one stage. An exploratory cohort is anticipated to enroll approximately 200 patients with MASH/NASH and fibrosis screen-failed on histology for the main NATiV3 clinical trial. Inventiva anticipates that this exploratory cohort may allow the generation of additional data using non-invasive tests and contribute to the regulatory safety database requirement to support the planned submission for potential accelerated approval to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and potential conditional approval to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) of lanifibranor for the treatment of MASH/NASH. Topline results of NATiV3 are expected for the second half 2026.

A post-hoc analysis of brain imaging at 0 and 24 hours using artificial intelligence confirmed these results  showing a reduction in the number and volume of intracerebral lesions in patients treated with glenzocimab.On April 25  2024  the company announced the initial results of the international phase 2/3 ACTISAVE study in the treatment of acute ischemic stroke  which showed no efficacy of glenzocimab on the primary endpoint  the proportion of patients with severe disability or death (mRS 4-6) 90 days after stroke  nor on the secondary endpoint  the proportion of patients returning to life without disability (mRS 0-2).On May 15  2024  Prof. Mikael KÃ¶hrmann (Principal Investigator of ACTISAVE) presented the main results of the study at the opening session of the European Stroke Organization Conference (ESOC)  confirming the neutrality of the study on the primary and secondary endpoints  and showing trends in return to normal life (mRS 0-1)  notably in sub-populations of patients with complete recanalization after mechanical thrombectomy.Glenzocimab is being evaluated in 2 other clinical trials initiated by academic teams:GREEN: a phase 2/3 study in the treatment of stroke in thrombectomized patients  with a futility analysis after inclusion of the first 78 patients (30% of patients) expected in Q4 2024;LIBERATE: a Phase 2b LIBERATE trial in the treatment of myocardial infarction  with final results expected in Q4 2025.Acticor Biotech is supported by a panel of European and international investors (Mediolanum farmaceutici  Karista  Go Capital  Newton Biocapital  CMS Medical Venture Investment (HK) Limited  A&B (HK) Limited  Anaxago  and the Armesa Foundation) and has been listed on Euronext Growth Paris since November 2021 (ISIN: FR0014005OJ5 - ALACT).View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240705781727/en/ACTICOR BIOTECHGilles AVENARD  MDCEO and Foundergilles.avenard@acticor-biotech.comSophie BINAY  PhDGeneral Manager and CSOSophie.binay@acticor-biotech.comNewCapMathilde BOHINInvestor Relationsacticor@newcap.euT. : +33 (0)1 44 71 94 95NewCapArthur ROUILLÃ‰Media Relationsacticor@newcap.euT. : +33 (0)1 44 71 00 15Source: Acticor Biotech,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,negative,0.0,0.12,0.88,True,English,"['Acticor Biotech', 'Total Number', 'Voting Rights', 'Investing.com', 'Disclosure', 'Shares', 'May', 'Arthur ROUILLÃ‰ Media Relations acticor', 'Prof. Mikael KÃ¶hrmann', 'CMS Medical Venture Investment', 'French Financial Markets Authority', 'clinical stage biopharmaceutical company', 'Phase 2b LIBERATE trial', 'European Stroke Organization Conference', '2 other clinical trials', 'Investor Relations acticor', 'clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company', 'French Commercial Code', 'Euronext Growth Paris', 'phase 1b/2a study', 'phase 2/3 study', 'acute ischemic stroke', 'actual voting rights', '2/3 ACTISAVE study', 'international phase', 'ACTICOR BIOTECH', 'BUSINESS WIRE', 'Regulatory News', 'innovative drug', 'cardiovascular emergencies', 'General Regulation', 'Listing Place', 'ISIN Code', 'Web site', 'share capital', 'general meeting', 'Lancet Neurology', 'safety profile', 'intracerebral hemorrhage', 'glenzocimab-treated group', 'post-hoc analysis', 'brain imaging', 'artificial intelligence', 'intracerebral lesions', 'secondary endpoint', 'Principal Investigator', 'opening session', 'complete recanalization', 'mechanical thrombectomy', 'academic teams', 'futility analysis', 'myocardial infarction', 'international investors', 'Mediolanum farmaceutici', 'Go Capital', 'Newton Biocapital', 'HK) Limited', 'A&B', 'Armesa Foundation', 'General Manager', 'Mathilde BOHIN', 'positive results', 'initial results', 'main results', 'final results', 'total number', 'Date Number', 'Theoretical number', 'stroke patients', 'primary endpoint', 'severe disability', 'normal life', 'source version', 'thrombectomized patients', 'first 78 patients', 'Article L.', 'Gilles AVENARD', 'Sophie BINAY', 'FR0014005OJ5', 'ALACT', 'treatment', 'shares', 'May', 'accordance', 'AMF', 'vote', 'basis', 'ACTIMIS', 'January', 'link', 'publication', 'reduction', 'mortality', '24 hours', 'volume', 'April', 'efficacy', 'proportion', 'death', 'mRS', 'ESOC', 'neutrality', 'trends', 'return', 'sub-populations', 'GREEN', 'inclusion', 'Q4', 'panel', 'Karista', 'Anaxago', 'November', 'businesswire', 'MD', 'CEO', 'Founder', 'PhD', 'CSO', 'acticor-biotech', 'NewCap', 'T.']",2024-07-05,2024-07-06,investing.com

The patent application seeks to cover the use of Medsenic’s ATO platform  to prevent or alleviate the cytokine storm associated with systemic infections of various origins but sharing a common set of key symptoms (such as persistent hypotension  hyperthermia or hypothermia  leukocytosis or leukopenia  and thrombocytopenia) with dramatic short-term health consequences. Similar protection may lead to the filing of further specific divisional applications  in particular at the European Patent Office (EPO).Medsenic SAS  subsidiary of BioSenic SA  is exploring the therapeutic use of ATO in several indications with clinical success. The company is also making significant progress in elucidating the mechanisms by which ATO modulates immune responses and the ability of certain metal ions to enhance this therapeutic potential. The ever-growing intellectual property portfolio is part of a strategy to build strong and meaningful protection around its lead product  ATO  paving the way for clinical and commercial development by the company and its partners  particularly in the field of autoimmunity.The new patent  now being extended by Medsenic in the USA  covers two main areas of immediate application. The first is in immune- and autoimmune-related diseases - specifically BioSenic's current lead project  chronic GvHD  and later systemic sclerosis and systemic lupus erythematosus. The second is oncology  where ATO has already demonstrated exceptional results in patients  including complete remissions in acute promyelocytic leukaemia. The growing patent family will support Medsenic/BioSenic's plans for international clinical trials in pathologies with unmet medical needs. The company's long-term goal is to seek market access approvals for its various formulations  optimizing the original properties of arsenic salts  alone or in combination.François Rieger  PhD  Chairman and CEO of BioSenic said: ""The current effort to improve the field of indications and a broader intellectual property for the use of original formulations and composition of matter related to the extraordinary properties of arsenic salts should give a dramatic impetus to the clinical and commercial development of the company. Arsenic salts are now found to exhibit critical and very original biological properties that should help provide new ways to treat diseases of the immune system and  further  cancer conditions with no effective medical treatment. It is of great interest that pharmacological formulations containing arsenic salts are often found to redirect organisms towards normal functioning of various cells and organs and restore homeostasis. We are delighted to be opening new chapters in the continuing global effort to control chronic or fatal diseases for which there is no real cure.”The expected availability of both an intravenous and an oral formulation combining arsenic and copper puts BioSenic in a unique position to build on preclinical successes in chosen areas of applications. Medsenic/BioSenic should be able to continue a successful clinical development involving proprietary original formulations with arsenic and new active ingredients such as metal ions- increasing the efficacy of its products and minimizing side effects.Medsenic's worldwide patent family already includes a patent granted by the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EP3972613) in April 2023  and others by the China National Intellectual Property Administration in August 2023  by the Australian Patent Office in December 2023 and by Canada in January 2024 (3 138 472).About BioSenicBioSenic is a leading biotech company specializing in the development of clinical assets issued from its Medsenic’s arsenic trioxide (ATO) platform. Key target indications for the autoimmune platform include graft-versus-host-disease (GvHD)  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  and now systemic sclerosis (SSc).Following the merger in October 2022  BioSenic combined the strategic positionings and strengths of Medsenic and Bone Therapeutics. The merger specifically enables Medsenic/Biosenic to develop an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/oral ATO (OATO).BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About the main Medsenic/BioSenic technology platformThe ATO platform provides derived active products with immunomodulatory properties and fundamental effects on the activated cells of the immune system. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. cGvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT).Medsenic has been successful in a phase 2 trial with its intravenous formulation  Arscimed®  which has orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA. The company is heading towards an international phase 3 confirmatory study  with its new  IP-protected  OATO formulation. Another selected target is moderate-to-severe forms of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae  and the gastrointestinal tract). Systemic sclerosis is now full part of the clinical pipeline of Medsenic/BioSenic. This serious chronic disease badly affects skin  lungs  or vascularization  and has no current effective treatment. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive  giving good grounds to launch a phase 2 clinical protocol  using new immunomodulatory formulations of APIs recognized to be active on the immune system.The company is currently focusing its present R&D and clinical activities on a selective  accelerated development of its autoimmune platform.Note: The allogeneic cell therapy platform-originating from the previous listed company Bone Therapeutics company  may be of renewed interest by using isolated and purified differentiated bone marrow Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) as a starting material for further isolation of passive or active biological subcellular elements. Indeed  these cells may provide new subcellular vesicles potentially able to deliver a unique and proprietary approach to organ repair. BioSenic is now involved in determining new patentable approaches in this complex area of cell therapy.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAFrançois Rieger  PhD  CEOTel: +33 (0)671 73 31 59investorrelations@biosenic.comCertain statements  beliefs and opinions in this press release are forward-looking  which reflect the company or  as appropriate  the company directors’ current expectations and projections about future events.

43574,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.investing.com/news/press-releases/eurofins-provides-further-refutations-to-another-set-of-baseless-allegations-and-misleading-information-spread-by-muddy-waters-93CH-3508662,Eurofins provides further refutations to another set of baseless allegations and misleading information spread by Muddy Waters By Investing.com,Eurofins provides further refutations to another set of baseless allegations and misleading information spread by Muddy Waters,LUXEMBOURG--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Regulatory News:Eurofins (Paris:ERF):In response to the reports by Muddy Waters (NYSE: )  LLC (MW) on Eurofins published on 24 June 2024 and 03 July 2024 and expanding on its previous press releases on this subject on 25 June 2024 and 03 July 2024  Eurofins is providing further detailed information to refute the baseless allegations intentionally spread by the short seller MW  further evidencing and supporting Eurofins' view that the entirety of the allegations and insinuations contained in MW's reports are either inaccurate  irrelevant  biased and/or misleading.Allegations made by MW in its reports are listed below  referencing the pages and dates of publication of the reports where the allegations are made.MW allegation: Eurofins' Cash Accounting Seems Designed to Maximize Confusion and Inaccuracy “ if Not Outright Overstatement (p. 10 in MW report published on 24 June 2024)Eurofins response: As provided in Eurofins' previous responses  this accusation is false  misleading and defamatory. Cash is audited each year by Deloitte and the auditors of all Eurofins local operating companies by direct confirmations from banks. There is thus no doubt about Eurofins' cash position at 31 December 2023. In response to suggestions by some of its significant long-term institutional shareholders  Eurofins has mandated Ernst & Young Paris  one of the leading auditors for companies  to perform an additional independent audit of Eurofins' cash pooling arrangements and cash situation in its consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2023 and will report on the findings when available.MW allegations: Eurofins' Response About Audit Coverage is Misleading (p. 27 in MW report published on 03 July 2024) and Eurofins' has at least 18 Auditors Across the Eurofins Network (p. 33 in MW report published on 03 July 2024)Eurofins response: As provided in Eurofins' previous responses and made unambiguously clear on p. 216 of its 2023 Annual Report  to ensure a high degree of internal control in a decentral organisation  Eurofins has been commissioning  for more than two decades  local statutory and independent audits for all its operating subsidiaries worldwide  even where not required by law  with 97-98% coverage of the Company's total external sales  EBITDA and total assets  by four Tier 1 and seven Tier 2 auditing firms. For the purpose of comparison  this is significantly higher than SGS' reported audit scope of 68% (p. 134 of the SGS 2023 Integrated Report). The assertion by MW that Eurofins has at least 18 auditors is deeply shortsighted and misleading as it not only double counts auditing firms that belong to the same Tier 1 and Tier 2 auditing networks  but also counts non-Tier 1 or Tier 2 auditing firms  covering less than 3% of Eurofins' revenues  EBITDA or total assets  mandated by recently acquired companies  which cannot be changed in certain geographies until the expiration of the auditing mandate made by the acquired company prior to its acquisition.MW allegation: India “ we believe that people performing the consolidation work need stature within an organization  as they often require ongoing cooperation from subsidiaries' finance teams. For this reason alone  India seems an odd choice for Eurofins' consolidation function. (p. 3 in MW report published on 03 July 2024)Eurofins response: This contention by MW is utterly false and no single piece of evidence was provided by MW to support it. Eurofins' consolidation teams have always been based in France since the Company's IPO in 1997. Consolidation relies on IBM (NYSE: ) Cognos Controller to support the close  consolidation and reporting process by properly eliminating any intercompany bookings on a monthly basis.MW allegations: [Eurofins Genomics Europe DTC Population Genetics Products and Services Ltd] has zero employees  but (among other anomalies) ¦ and While there could be an innocent explanation for this  we believe this illustrates the hundreds of dials Eurofins could turn to create revenue and expenses were senior management inclined. (p. 16 in MW report published on 03 July 2024).Eurofins response: MW is painting a flawed and deeply misleading view of Eurofins Genomics Europe DTC (DTC) by selectively excluding the extract from the company's statutory report that explains how DTC's business leverages the synergies of the Eurofins network by assigning employees from an existing operating company to support the quick ramp up of this new activity.MW allegation: Case Study in Restatement that Nets Related Party Receivables and Payables of ~ €75 Million (pp. 6-10 in MW report published on 03 July 2024)Eurofins response: The restatement of the 2017 statutory audit of Eurofins Support Services LUX Holding S.Ã r.l was made when PwC recertified all statutory accounts of Eurofins companies registered in Luxembourg following unfounded allegations of wrongdoing by local auditors. As cited by MW on p. 10 of their report published on 03 July 2024  the reclassifications of Receivables and Payables with affiliated entities (in companies controlled by Eurofins Scientific SE which have nothing to do with related parties of Eurofins) impact neither the result for the financial year ended 31 December 2017 nor the shareholders' equity as at 31 December 2017. Furthermore  since all intercompany positions are fully eliminated in consolidation  such a restatement of accounts of one subsidiary had no impact on the Group IFRS consolidated financial statements.MW allegation: Immaterial Entities - We estimate that in 2022  ~ €1.5 billion to €1.7 billion of Eurofins' revenue was generated by ~800 to ~900 entities that each generated less than €5 million in revenue (p. 3 in MW report published on 03 July 2024)Eurofins response: The small size of some of Eurofins' legal entities is a well-known and distinctive factor in Eurofins' decentralised structure of entrepreneur-led companies that promotes closer relationships with  and more individualised services for  clients  while fostering business agility  empowerment  entrepreneurship and scientific innovation. Eurofins operates in over 60 countries across multiple business lines  all of which adhere to different and specific regulation which increases the need for independent companies by country and area of activity. Eurofins management is of the opinion that this structure benefits the quality and speed of service provided to clients  increases employee and leadership satisfaction and minimises overall risks to the network. As frequently cited in previous communication  to ensure a high degree of internal control in a decentral organisation  Eurofins has been commissioning  for more than two decades  local statutory and independent audits for all its operating subsidiaries worldwide  even where not required by law. Results and findings from these local statutory and independent audits are monitored centrally and reported to the Audit and Risk Committee of the Eurofins Board of Directors so that Eurofins can continuously strengthen its internal controls.MW allegation : Eurofins recently unequivocally denied using any factoring. However  we have evidence that Eurofins almost certainly factors both receivables and payables (pp. 22-26 in MW report published on 03 July 2024)Eurofins response: Eurofins has a policy of no factoring. When doing a review of the Company's financial notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in FY21 for better readability  the previous disclosure regarding factoring was removed  in line with Eurofins' no factoring policy  as the IFRS standard clearly mandates a disclosure only if known and material factoring is used. The allegation that Eurofins would have financed its growth since 2014 (when Eurofins' revenues were only €1.4bn vs €6.5bn in 2023) largely through factoring is wrong and clearly in contradiction with the debt and equity issuances made during that period and the fact that the Company's net working capital ratios did not materially change throughout that period.MW allegation : Eurofins Response about Cash & Equivalents Reclassification is Misleading (pp. 28-31 in MW report published on 03 July 2024)Eurofins response: Eurofins' auditors in Spain have confirmed to the Company that the classification of cash pooling amounts as cash and equivalents is correct and conforms to the local generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requirements given the nature of Eurofins' cash pooling arrangements (e.g.  upstream only  callable back by the operating entity without conditions). Eurofins cannot speculate on the nature of cash pooling arrangements used by the local subsidiary of another TIC company and why they would trigger different disclosures.MW allegations : Various purported quotations from supposedly former Eurofins employees  cited on numerous instances in MW's reportsEurofins response: As already explained in Eurofins' response on 03 July 2024  MW's use of truncated quotations from anonymous purported former employees from unidentified Eurofins companies and periods of employment completely lack credibility. Eurofins also cannot trace  investigate or comment on these extravagant and unfounded allegations other than to complete disagree with these statements.MW allegation : Hypothetical scenario of how a company could potentially alter its accounts including: Below  we theorize one way that such a balkanized structure could be abused to create sham sales. We have no direct evidence this has occurred  but we find it plausible (p. 4 in MW report published on 03 July 2024)Eurofins response: In all its communications  MW has never shown any evidence of any errors in  or unreliability of  Eurofins' consolidated financial statements  but instead only formulated journalistic opinions  unsubstantiated hypotheses and theories and baseless accusations. Even when MW claimed to present facts  these were often blatantly wrong as demonstrated by Eurofins with public filings and/or were otherwise irrelevant and proved nothing. It is very unfortunate that such careless  self-serving and aggressive communication by MW may have caused damage to some investors  especially passive funds and individual investors who may be less familiar with the practices of short sellers.Comments from the CEO  Dr Gilles Martin:Once again Eurofins is proving that the ˜opinion journalism' contained in Muddy Waters' reports is nothing more than baseless allegations and misleading information meant to harm Eurofins' employees  bondholders  shareholders and other stakeholders. In this context  we will continue to provide clear explanations and supportive evidence to comprehensively address MW's unfounded claims and insinuations regarding how we conduct our business and manage our organisation  even though MW itself admits that it lacks direct evidence to defend its opinions. However unnecessary it may be  we do not preclude taking further actions with external forensic and accounting experts to demonstrate the integrity of our systems and controls. In the meantime  we are liaising with our legal advisors and European regulators and will provide all necessary assistance required to investigate any possible market manipulation of Eurofins' securities by MW  and parties potentially acting together with MW  that may have allowed them to profiteer from the disruption of financial markets they caused. Our shareholders and stakeholders should remain certain that we will continue to forcefully defend ourselves against these and any future slanderous allegations from MW and any other sources.About Eurofins “ the global leader in bio-analysisEurofins is Testing for Life.

The satellite radio company  which also owns music streaming service Pandora and has high hopes for its revamped SiriusXM streaming app  is likely benefitting from an upcoming 10-to-1 reverse stock split and merger with Liberty Media’s SiriusXM Group tracking stock. The merger eliminates any confusion amongst investors by creating only one way to invest in SiriusXM. And although the split doesn’t affect the company’s value  it will increase the share price by reducing the number of shares outstanding. That  in turn  could help SiriusXM’s image with investors and further help prop up the share price.French streaming company Deezer rose 20.3% to 2.07 euros ($2.25) after it completed a public offering that transferred shares from the professional to the general segment of the Euronext Paris. (The professional segment is dedicated to companies that did not have an initial public offering or sale of shares. Deezer gained entry to the Euronext Paris through a merger with I2PO  a special purpose acquisition company  in 2022.) With that improvement  Deezer’s year-to-date loss improved to 12.3% from 19.2% a week ago. The company will report first-half earnings results on July 30.Trending on BillboardThe Billboard Global Music Index (BGMI) rose 1.6% to 1 844.87  nearly matching the all-time record of 1 847.64 set the week ended May 17  with the large gains enjoyed by SiriusXM and Deezer helping offset losses by 11 of the index’s 20 stocks.

In the United States  the Nasdaq composite gained 3.5% to 18 352.76 and the S&P 500 rose 2.0% to 5 567.19 — both record closes. Stocks were aided by data released on Friday by the U.S. Labor Department that showed that the economy added more jobs than expected in June while the increase in hourly earnings met expectations. The rise in the unemployment rate rise from 4.0% to 4.1% was a surprise  however.Internationally  the U.K.’s FTSE 100 improved 0.5% to 8 203.93. South Korea’s KOSPI composite index gained 2.3% to 2 862.23. China’s Shanghai Composite Index dropped 0.6% to 2 949.93.Sphere Entertainment Co. improved 6.8% to $37.43  bringing its year-to-date gain to 10.1%.
