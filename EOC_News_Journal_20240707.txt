By protecting the food from extreme heat  this alternative food processing method preserves the meal's vital nutrients  flavor  appearance  and other organoleptic characteristics. Non-thermal techniques like high-pressure processing and pulse electric fields are rising in favor of the beverage industry because they effectively extend beverage shelf life and prevent microbial growth. During non-thermal methods  food is stored at a lower temperature  which prolongs its shelf life and maintains its essential flavor  nutrients  and appearance. Customers are becoming increasingly aware of the importance of safe food handling practices as a result of the rise in foodborne illnesses and outbreaks. They are searching for dietary items free of harmful ingredients and microbes. The need for non-thermal pasteurization has increased due to the growing demand for processed foods  frozen products  and meal preparation. Furthermore  the high initial and ongoing expenses of high-pressure processing and pulsed electric field systems could serve as an obstacle for some companies.Browse key industry insights spread across 214 pages with 110 Market data tables and figures & charts from the report on the "" Global Non-thermal Pasteurization Market Size  Share  and COVID-19 Impact Analysis  By Technique (High Pressure Processing  Pulse Electric Field  Ultrasonic  and Others)  By Application (Food  Beverages  and Pharmaceuticals)  By Form (Solid and Liquid)  and By Region (North America  Europe  Asia-Pacific  Latin America  Middle East  and Africa)  Analysis and Forecast 2023 – 2033.""Buy Now Full Report: https://www.sphericalinsights.com/checkout/4812The high pressure processing segment is Expected to hold the largest share of the non-thermal pasteurization market during the projected timeframe.Based on the technique  the non-thermal pasteurization market is divided into high pressure processing  pulse electric field  ultrasonic  and others.
