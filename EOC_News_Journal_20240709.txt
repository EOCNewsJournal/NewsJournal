The revision reflects a positive outlook on the company's performance  anticipating a strong second quarter of 2024 across most of its business divisions.The analyst from Deutsche Bank noted that despite the absence of a rerating for Deutsche Boerse in 2024  there has been a gradual increase in consensus forecasts year-to-date. Consequently  the bank has raised its 2024 estimates for the company once again.The forecast suggests a robust performance in the second quarter of 2024 across various segments  with the exception of Investment Management Solutions  which typically experiences a seasonal slowdown.Deutsche Boerse is currently trading at 17 times its estimated earnings per share for 2025 and at 12.6 times its 2025 estimated enterprise value to earnings before interest and taxes (EV/EBIT). Deutsche Bank's outlook remains favorable towards Deutsche Boerse  although it acknowledges that there are fewer positive catalysts compared to Euronext.The updated stock price target is based on the bank's assessment of the company's financial outlook  which includes expectations of a good performance in the upcoming quarter. The bank's stance is backed by the year-to-date incremental improvements in the consensus forecasts  which have contributed to the raised estimates for 2024.In other recent news  Deutsche Borse AG has announced its Q1 2024 results  revealing a 16% increase in net revenue  aided by the integration of SimCorp that led to a 15% rise in annual recurring revenue (ARR).The company also confirmed its full-year guidance  projecting over €5.6 billion in net revenue and over €3.2 billion in EBITDA. Furthermore  Deutsche Borse AG completed a €300 million share buyback program  demonstrating a strengthening balance sheet.The firm has also revealed a leadership transition  with Stephan Leithner set to succeed Theodor Weimer as CEO. Amid market volatility and interest rate changes  the company maintains a cautious optimism for the year.These recent developments also highlight Deutsche Borse AG's successful integration of SimCorp  which is expected to generate €600 million in revenues  and the firm's dominant position in European power derivatives.Despite headwinds from lower market volatility affecting the Trading and Clearing segment  the company's Security Services segment reached a record €14.9 trillion in custody assets. Analysts from various firms anticipate that the company's future performance will be influenced by interest rate developments and market volatility.InvestingPro InsightsAs Deutsche Bank projects a strong performance for Deutsche Boerse AG in the upcoming quarter  real-time data from InvestingPro aligns with this positive outlook.

DBV is currently focused on investigating the use of its proprietary technology platform  Viaskin™  to address food allergies  which are caused by a hypersensitive immune reaction and characterized by a range of symptoms varying in severity from mild to life-threatening anaphylaxis. Millions of people live with food allergies  including young children. Through epicutaneous immunotherapy (EPIT™)  the Viaskin platform is designed to introduce microgram amounts of a biologically active compound to the immune system through intact skin. EPIT is a new class of non-invasive treatment that seeks to modify an individual’s underlying allergy by re-educating the immune system to become desensitized to allergen by leveraging the skin’s immune tolerizing properties. DBV is committed to transforming the care of food allergic people. The Company’s food allergy programs include ongoing clinical trials of Viaskin Peanut in peanut allergic toddlers (1 through 3 years of age) and children (4 through 7 years of age).DBV Technologies is headquartered in Châtillon  France  with North American operations in Warren  NJ.

With this acquisition  Oxurion will add a profitable and fast-growing entity to its assets.The transaction values the shares of the target company on a 100% basis at €12.23 million (including €3.2m of cash and €1m of financial debt). The envisaged structuring of the transaction consists in a 80% buyout of the current shareholders  on a prorata basis.Payment would be made in three steps: an initial payment of €4.39 million at closing  an earn-out of up to €4.39 million conditional on achieving an EBITDA of €860 000 in 2024 and a payment of €1 million payable in June 2025.Funding for the transaction will be secured at the level of an Oxurion's subsidiary  through a mix of debt financing (non dilutive) and funding on Oxurion level (than can be either a shareholder loan or equity/quasi equity financing).While Oxurion management will maximise the use of non-dilutive instruments  the transaction will have a dilutive impact for shareholders  still to be quantified.The objective of the potential transaction is to offset the dilutive impact of its financing by creating value for the shareholders.The target company is the result of collaboration between leading French institutions  notably INSERM and CNRS. Already a world leader in the field of stem cells  the company is projecting sales of around €3m for 2024.The company is part of a steady and highly profitable growth model  with a revenue CAGR (Compounded Annual Growth Rate) of 33% between 2021 and 2023 and an EBITDA margin of 30% projected in 2024 and a highly diversified customer portfolio including the leading global players of the pharmaceutical sector.The company is recognized for its pioneering work  notably in the production of human cells  which reinforces its strong potential for sales growth. Its performance is also underpinned by the range of complementary CRO services it has recently developed  and which it has been gradually rolling out to key accounts since the beginning of the year.Pascal Ghoson  CEO of Oxurion  comments: ""This first acquisition marks an extremely important milestone in the life of Oxurion. Our objective was to diversify our activities through external growth  and this is what we are currently delivering 5 months after I started. Our aim is to put our skills at the service of the target company  whose potential is recognized worldwide  to enable it to achieve its business plan in 2028  with sales of €8.1m and EBITDA of €2.8m"".The transaction is subject to the completion of due diligence work (financial  legal  technical)  which is due to start in July  with completion scheduled for the end of September 2024. Signature of the definitive documentation is scheduled for October 2024 at the latest.The transaction will not impact Oxurion's current preclinical program  neither financially nor in terms of the dedicated workforce. This is because the transaction will not be funded under the existing Atlas Funding Program and will primarily be managed by external advisors. While some limited due diligence costs will be borne under the current Atlas Funding Program  the largest part of the contemplated transaction costs (mostly success fees) will be part of the acquisition funding currently being structured.Oxurion will provide the market with information on the progress of the transaction and the final financing terms  which are currently still being studied and structured.About OxurionOxurion (Euronext Brussels: OXUR) is engaged in the development of next-generation standard ophthalmic therapies for the treatment of retinal diseases.

The revision reflects a positive outlook on the company's performance  anticipating a strong second quarter of 2024 across most of its business divisions.The analyst from Deutsche Bank noted that despite the absence of a rerating for Deutsche Boerse in 2024  there has been a gradual increase in consensus forecasts year-to-date. Consequently  the bank has raised its 2024 estimates for the company once again.The forecast suggests a robust performance in the second quarter of 2024 across various segments  with the exception of Investment Management Solutions  which typically experiences a seasonal slowdown.Deutsche Boerse is currently trading at 17 times its estimated earnings per share for 2025 and at 12.6 times its 2025 estimated enterprise value to earnings before interest and taxes (EV/EBIT). Deutsche Bank's outlook remains favorable towards Deutsche Boerse  although it acknowledges that there are fewer positive catalysts compared to Euronext.The updated stock price target is based on the bank's assessment of the company's financial outlook  which includes expectations of a good performance in the upcoming quarter. The bank's stance is backed by the year-to-date incremental improvements in the consensus forecasts  which have contributed to the raised estimates for 2024.In other recent news  Deutsche Borse AG has announced its Q1 2024 results  revealing a 16% increase in net revenue  aided by the integration of SimCorp that led to a 15% rise in annual recurring revenue (ARR).The company also confirmed its full-year guidance  projecting over €5.6 billion in net revenue and over €3.2 billion in EBITDA. Furthermore  Deutsche Borse AG completed a €300 million share buyback program  demonstrating a strengthening balance sheet.The firm has also revealed a leadership transition  with Stephan Leithner set to succeed Theodor Weimer as CEO. Amid market volatility and interest rate changes  the company maintains a cautious optimism for the year.These recent developments also highlight Deutsche Borse AG's successful integration of SimCorp  which is expected to generate €600 million in revenues  and the firm's dominant position in European power derivatives.Despite headwinds from lower market volatility affecting the Trading and Clearing segment  the company's Security Services segment reached a record €14.9 trillion in custody assets. Analysts from various firms anticipate that the company's future performance will be influenced by interest rate developments and market volatility.InvestingPro InsightsAs Deutsche Bank projects a strong performance for Deutsche Boerse AG in the upcoming quarter  real-time data from InvestingPro aligns with this positive outlook. The company boasts a high shareholder yield and a commendable track record of raising its dividend for 9 consecutive years  underscoring its commitment to returning value to shareholders.

(Euronext Growth Paris: ALTME)  a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing novel therapies for trea,"BERLIN--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Regulatory News:TME Pharma N.V. (Euronext Growth Paris: ALTME)  a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing novel therapies for treatment of cancer by targeting the tumor microenvironment (TME)  released today a message from Aram Mangasarian  CEO of TME Pharma  to its shareholders.Dear Shareholders In the first half of 2024  we delivered a series of significant achievements  further strengthening the potential of our lead asset NOX-A12 and positioning TME Pharma as a pioneer in glioblastoma treatment  an urgent medical need.I am pleased to write to you with an update on our progress during what has been a very busy and exciting start to the year  following a year of delivery on our promises including:Median survival nearly double  and 21-month survival 10-fold greater  than that of a standard‑of-care reference cohort in brain cancer (glioblastoma) patients with chemotherapy‑refractory residual tumor after surgery 1Approval of our brain cancer Phase 2 clinical trial design by the US FDA 2Fast Track designation granted by the US FDA for our lead asset  NOX-A12  in glioblastoma 3Publication of NOX-A12 clinical data in the high-profile scientific journal Nature Communications 4Complete elimination of convertible debt from the capital structure of the company 5Recruitment of a new US-based board member with highly relevant partnering and M&A experience in the brain cancer space6Constructive Engagement with Strategic Partners and Investors and a Clear Vision for the Future of TME PharmaBased on the successful delivery of these objectives  we are now in discussions with strategic partners and investors interested in the potential of NOX-A12 program. Our goal is to finalize these discussions in the 4th quarter of 2024 before another capital increase is needed. This will allow us to progress towards our future vision for the company of having NOX‑A12 approved for use in glioblastoma patients with TME Pharma in a strategic partnership with a pharmaceutical company and having support from governmental/charitable organizations and expert biotech investors. Once we can start the planned randomized  controlled Phase 2 clinical trial  we estimate that in approximately 3 years we will have sufficient data to launch a pivotal clinical trial that could lead to approval with positive results.Potential for Unprecedented Clinical Benefit in GlioblastomaIn our most significant clinical accomplishment to date  we announced survival data from our GLORIA study obtained in newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients with extremely poor prognosis: tumors resistant to standard chemotherapy plus incomplete surgical resection. The study achieved a remarkable 19.9-month median overall survival (mOS) rate for patients receiving NOX-A12 in combination with the VEGF inhibitor bevacizumab and radiotherapy. This nearly doubles the 10.5‑month mOS rate demonstrated in the standard of care matched reference cohort. If this result is confirmed in a larger  randomized clinical trial  it would offer NOX-A12 a clear clinically and commercially relevant advantage over the current standard of care.Moreover  the NOX-A12 survival results surpass those from what we believe are all relevant competitor therapy trials in newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients resistant to standard chemotherapy7. NOX‑A12’s effectiveness is even more impressive considering the NOX-A12 GLORIA trial enrolled patients with a worse prognosis than those in the competitor trials. The NOX-A12 trial only enrolled patients with residual detectable tumor after surgery whereas competitor trials also included patients with no detectable tumor after surgery  thereby giving the patients in these competitor trials a better expected average survival outcome.This progress highlights the immense potential of NOX-A12 to transform the treatment of glioblastoma patients  who face a devastating prognosis from this highly aggressive form of brain cancer. With a median overall survival of 8 months  a staggering 93% of patients do not survive beyond five years and the current standard of care offers no cure and only limited survival benefit8. This huge unmet medical need demonstrates the importance of our goal to develop NOX-A12 to become part of the best glioblastoma therapy for newly diagnosed patients and make it available to them as fast as we can.Constructive Interactions with US RegulatorWe engaged in discussions with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to establish a clear regulatory roadmap for the next stage of NOX-A12's clinical development and submitted an Investigational New Drug (IND) application for NOX-A12 in glioblastoma. This IND was approved by the FDA  paving the way for a new randomized  controlled Phase 2 clinical study. Randomized clinical trial data are a key benchmark for big pharmaceutical companies and later-stage cancer assets command higher valuations for milestone payments and in transactions  on average  so it is crucial for us to advance NOX-A12 into this Phase 2 evaluation.Following the IND approval  NOX-A12 was also granted Fast Track designation by the US FDA. This designation  a second key regulatory milestone  aims to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drugs addressing serious conditions like glioblastoma. Fast Track designation allows for more frequent interactions with the FDA throughout the clinical development phase  enabling TME Pharma to optimize the design of the Phase 2 study and potentially accelerated timelines. It also means we have the potential to qualify for ""accelerated approval"" and ""priority review"" if NOX-A12 meets the relevant criteria.We perceive the achievement of these two key regulatory milestones as the FDA's recognition not only of the urgent unmet medical need which glioblastoma represents  but also the potential of NOX-A12 to address it. This paves the way to accelerate NOX-A12's route to market and to de-risk its development  while providing investors and potential partners with a clear development pathway for NOX-A12. The open IND will allow us to expand our clinical development in the US  the most financially important market for new pharmaceuticals9  where we anticipate significant interest from the medical community.Funding Phase 2 Clinical Trial and Managerial EngagementIn our trial design and planning  we have been implementing strategies to optimize timelines and reduce costs of our glioblastoma program overall. Sufficient supply of NOX-A12 is available to initiate the trial quickly upon closing the funding gap. We continue discussions with engaged stakeholders and are pursuing funding options through a combination of non-dilutive grant funding  a strategic alliance and/or investment from expert institutional investors  with the objective to materialize these interactions in Q4-2024.As we work to secure the Phase 2 trial financing  we have cleaned up our balance sheet removing all convertible debt instruments and recently announced a cash runway extension to year-end. To highlight my confidence in our mission  I personally invested in the company subscribing to more than 500 000 new shares since December 202310.I would like to thank all of you  our shareholders  for your continued commitment and support of our efforts. After having achieved all our recent clinical  regulatory  and financial targets we remain focused on delivering our main mission: to bring NOX-A12 to market as quickly as possible to offer a solution to patients affected by a devastating disease  glioblastoma.Yours sincerely Aram MangasarianCEO  TME PharmaJuly 9th  2024About TME PharmaTME Pharma is a clinical-stage company focused on developing novel therapies for treatment of the most aggressive cancers. The company’s oncology-focused pipeline is designed to act on the tumor microenvironment (TME) and the cancer immunity cycle by breaking tumor protection barriers against the immune system and blocking tumor repair. By neutralizing chemokines in the TME  TME Pharma’s approach works in combination with other forms of treatment to weaken tumor defenses and enable greater therapeutic impact. In the GLORIA Phase 1/2 clinical trial  TME Pharma is studying its lead drug candidate NOX-A12 in newly diagnosed brain cancer patients who will not benefit clinically from standard chemotherapy. TME Pharma has delivered top-line data from the NOX-A12 three dose-escalation cohorts combined with radiotherapy of the GLORIA clinical trial  observing consistent tumor reductions and objective tumor responses. Additionally  GLORIA expansion arms evaluate safety and efficacy of NOX-A12 in other combinations where the interim results from the triple combination of NOX-A12  radiotherapy and bevacizumab suggest even deeper and more durable responses  and improved survival. US FDA has approved the design of a randomized Phase 2 trial in glioblastoma and TME Pharma was awarded fast track designation by the FDA for NOX-A12 in combination with radiotherapy and bevacizumab for use in the treatment of the aggressive adult brain cancer  glioblastoma. NOX-A12 in combination with radiotherapy had also previously received orphan drug designation (ODD) for glioblastoma in the United States and glioma in Europe. TME Pharma has delivered final top-line data with encouraging overall survival and safety profile from its NOX-A12 combination trial with Keytruda® in metastatic colorectal and pancreatic cancer patients  which was published in the Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer in October 2021. The company has entered in its second collaboration with MSD/Merck for its Phase 2 study  OPTIMUS  to further evaluate safety and efficacy of NOX-A12 in combination with Merck’s Keytruda® and two different chemotherapy regimens as second-line therapy in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. The design of the trial has been approved in France  Spain and the United States. The company’s second clinical-stage drug candidate  NOX-E36  is designed to target the innate immune system. TME Pharma is considering several solid tumors for further clinical development.

The future strategy includes investments in research and development  strategic collaborations  and the expansion of the distribution network to capitalize on emerging market opportunities.,"Regulatory News:Ikonisys SA (Euronext Growth Paris: ALIKO)  a leading company in early and accurate cancer diagnosis through cutting-edge and fully automated solutions for medical analysis laboratories  today announces that Hospitex International has secured two contracts for the supply of its products in Italy both for a 4-year term. The first contract involves the supply of BLOCKfast cytology kits to the Azienda USL Valle d'Aosta  and the second covers the supply of single-layer cytology for the ASL TO5 in Moncalieri.Winning these public tenders is another endorsement of the quality and reliability of the diagnostic solutions offered by Hospitex International. The proposed products were selected for their unique technological features  with significant improvements compared with the previously used technologies. Those have been acknowledged by public entities that have underscored the effectiveness and robustness of Hospitex's solutions  confirming that the products are extensively tested and certified.With these new contracts  Ikonisys and Hospitex further strengthen their positions in the diagnostic technology market  showing significant growth potential for the Group. The trust expressed by healthcare institutions through the awarding of public tenders reflects the growing opportunities in advanced diagnostic solutions. This success enables Ikonisys to further increase its position and ultimately the value creation for its shareholders  thanks to its innovative solutions and leading position in cancer diagnosis.As a reminder  BLOCKfast is an innovative kit dedicated to the preparation of cytological inclusions using a rapid method at room temperature and a natural replacement for the plasma-thrombin-based cytological inclusion method  which can no longer be used under current blood product legislation.The BLOCKfast kit offers several advantages. The reagents used are non-flammable  ensuring a safer working environment. The method allows the simultaneous preparation of multiple samples  thus optimizing time and improving the efficiency of the diagnostic process. The colored matrix included in the kit facilitates the rapid identification of the sample in paraffin and optimizes the cutting phase  ensuring that the cellular morphology remains unchanged. Furthermore  BLOCKfast is designed for morphological  immunohistocytochemical  and molecular analysis  offering a comprehensive solution for various diagnostic needs.Securing these two contracts with the Azienda USL Valle d'Aosta and the ASL TO5 not only strengthens Hospitex's market position but also represents a high-level endorsement  attesting that the proposed technologies meet rigorous quality and performance standards in particular by major healthcare institutions operating in areas with complex and strategically important diagnostic needs.Mario Crovetto  CEO of Ikonisys  and Alessandro Nosei  COO of Hospitex  commented: ""We are proud to have been selected by local companies  which further confirms the effectiveness of our diagnostic solutions in the oncology field. Our commitment is even more enhanced under these circumstances to successfully improving and streamlining oncology diagnosis. The recent awards  especially by public and healthcare entities  show that our technologies are appreciated and recognized for their reliability and innovativeness. Based on these achievements  we aim at positioning our future combined entities at the forefront of oncology diagnosis.""Ikonisys and Hospitex are committed to continuing their path of innovation  aiming to further expand their offerings and penetrate new markets.
