No chump c...,Britain completed repaying its Lend-Lease obligations to the United States in 2006. There is no such thing as a free lunch. Yet the Lend-Lease program cost the U.S. approximately $50 Billion USD (equivalent to about $680 Billion USD today. No chump change. As monetarist PM Margaret Thatcher opined as she snatched the little milk bottles from children's hands in 1976: 'There is no such thing as a free school meal'. The original agreement for Lend-Lease assistance during World War II stated that the goods given would be leased rather than donated  with repayment obligations to be laid out after the war ended. Negotiations continued over the terms of the repayment  and payments were made over several decades  the final payment made in 2006.The U.S. perceived the loans  as with the Marshall Plan for Germany (repaid in 1971) as existential. That is  Lend-Lease constitutes a type of symbiosis  creates dependencies  and allows the hegemonous power to acquire 'favors'. This  in Europe  amounted to air bases  diplomatic ties  and influence. The remit after 1945 was to keep the communist wolves from the door. It means the recipient is 'tied in' to the economic and political system of its donor. It works in a similar fashion for the Chinese; indebting south Asian nations with initially 'soft loans' but embedding their influence; it is 'Janus faced.'Fast forward and nothing has changed. The G7 rolls out its 'game changing' Lend Lease program for Ukraine in 2022 and has just agreed a new tranche of $50 Billion USD. It is a 'loan' secured against the confiscation of Russian assets. Outgoing UK PM Rishi Sunak described the $50 Billion USD loan as 'game-changing'. Its a 'win-win' for the U.S. as the loans are guaranteed against Russian assets. Yet it places Europe in a precarious situation as Russia has 5000 nuclear missiles on its borders. The U.S.  as usual  however  is playing the game 'away from home.’ The U.S. wants to have its cake and to eat it as well. Confiscated Russian assets  stored in Belgium's central depository 'Euroclear' assumes a $3 billion USD interest per year. By this method the U.S. can finance the war against Russia using Russia's own money.The signal is the thing  as Hamlet opined  to catch the conscience of the king (or the Tsar in this case). More important perhaps is the 'signal' this gives to China and Russia. It is (or was) that the west can penalise you if you don't play the game. Yet the long game of the Chinese sees its own currency-backed regime to rival dollar hegemony. And why not -- since they own the resources and oil to decouple from the dollar system? It's more important than the aid. It is part of the attempt to carve out the respective 'grossraums' (or civilisational empires) of the U.S. and China. This is the de facto realpolitik at work and has little to do with assumptions about 'Liberal Democracy'. That is old hat in a world of resource determination. Vassal states are all the rage in the 21st century.What could possibly go wrong? The U.S.  forcing the European states to freeze Russian assets  is effectively attempting to force Russia’s hand through asset confiscation. Although a big 'ouch' for the Russian nomenklatura  it fails to recognise the sea-change in the shifting oceans of 'empire.' The nation state is being undermined by epoch changing shifts. From a discontented EU  the limits of the post -Westphalian (Treaty of Westphalia 1648) world are coming to the fore. China and Russia see the transitions  but the West  mired in internal liberal struggles  refuse to recant (excuse the pun) on the eclipse of the Enlightenment. Liberal democracy effectively rests in a gargantuan tension between 'Liberty' and 'Equality.' These tensions have never been resolved  despite welfare states  socialist governments  Democrats and Republicans  and revolutions. These tensions become debilitating  especially in the West  in which they have become suicidal. The U.S. still has its old ally in Britain. But for how long? Whilst continental Europe turns toward a new Napoleonic system  this leaves Britain and Brexit as the new 'sick man of Europe'. Both the U.S. and Britain plod along with no ethos and a liberal Bidenesque confusion.Brian Patrick Bolger LSE  University of Liverpool.

Despite this  its dividends show signs of instability and unreliability over the past decade  with significant fluctuations and no consistent growth pattern. The company's earnings have increased by 84.1% over the last year  yet forecasts suggest a potential average decline of 1% annually for the next three years.

(Euronext: ONWD)  the medical technology company creating innovative spinal cord stimulation therapies to restore movement  function  and independence in people with spinal cord injury (SCI)  today announces a publication in Neuromodulation: Technology at the Neural Interface  summarizing effective stimulation parameters from the Up-LIFT and LIFT Home studies and providing a decision-making framework for clinical implementation of ONWARD ARC-EX Therapy created by study investigators.Investigational ARC-EX Therapy is non-invasive  programmed spinal cord stimulation designed to improve upper limb function after incomplete cervical SCI. The publication in Neuromodulation: Technology at the Neural Interface provides an evidence-based framework to determine stimulation parameters for ARC-EX Therapy based on analysis of device parameters  usage data  and clinician and participant feedback from the Up-LIFT pivotal trial and follow-on LIFT Home study.The Neuromodulation publication references observations and results from the Up-LIFT pivotal trial  which were published in May 2024 in Nature Medicine  and which demonstrated significant improvement in hand and arm function after SCI with use of ARC-EX Therapy. At the end of the trial  72% of participants were considered responders to non-invasive ARC-EX Therapy* based on a responder definition for participants to meet improvement criteria in both strength and functional domains. Notably  the number of responders increased to 90% when the definition included participants with improvements in at least one strength or functional outcome* and 87% of participants reported improvements in quality of life with ARC-EX Therapy*. There were no serious device-related adverse events observed during either the Up-LIFT trial or LIFT Home study.Up-LIFT and Lift Home study investigators recognized the importance of simplifying programming processes for their peers. “We are very excited to share the insights we gained through the first large-scale study of transcutaneous spinal stimulation with clinicians” said Chet Moritz  PhD  co-Principal Investigator of the Up-LIFT trial  publication co-author  and Professor of Electrical & Computer Engineering and Rehabilitation Medicine at the University of Washington. “These programming insights were developed based on our experience with 60 participants in the Up-LIFT trial  and we expect them to be very helpful in determining the optimal parameters for stimulation for a wide range of patients in the clinic.”To learn more about ONWARD Medical’s commitment to partnering with the SCI Community to develop innovative solutions for restoring movement  function  and independence after spinal cord injury  please visit ONWD.com.*Moritz  Chet  et al. “Non-invasive spinal cord stimulation for arm and hand function in chronic tetraplegia: a safety and efficacy trial.” Nature Medicine. 2024.Note: Unless otherwise noted  statements herein are based on the publication discussed: Gelenitis  Kristen  et al. “Non-invasive Transcutaneous Spinal Cord Stimulation Programming Recommendations for the Treatment of Upper Extremity Impairment in Tetraplegia” Neuromodulation. 2024.All ONWARD® Medical devices and therapies  including but not limited to ARC-IM®  ARC-EX®  ARC-BCI™  and ARC Therapy™  alone or in combination with a brain-computer interface (BCI)  are investigational and not available for commercial use.About ONWARD MedicalONWARD® Medical is a medical technology company creating therapies to restore movement  function  and independence in people with spinal cord injury (SCI) and movement disabilities.

(Euronext: ONWD)  the medical technology company creating innovative spinal cord stimulation therapies to restore movement  function  and independence in people with spinal cord injury (SCI)  today announces a publication in Neuromodulation: Technology at the Neural Interface  summarizing effective stimulation parameters from the Up-LIFT and LIFT Home studies and providing a decision-making framework for clinical implementation of ONWARD ARC-EX Therapy created by study investigators.Investigational ARC-EX Therapy is non-invasive  programmed spinal cord stimulation designed to improve upper limb function after incomplete cervical SCI. The publication in Neuromodulation: Technology at the Neural Interface provides an evidence-based framework to determine stimulation parameters for ARC-EX Therapy based on analysis of device parameters  usage data  and clinician and participant feedback from the Up-LIFT pivotal trial and follow-on LIFT Home study.The Neuromodulation publication references observations and results from the Up-LIFT pivotal trial  which were published in May 2024 in Nature Medicine  and which demonstrated significant improvement in hand and arm function after SCI with use of ARC-EX Therapy. At the end of the trial  72% of participants were considered responders to non-invasive ARC-EX Therapy based on a responder definition for participants to meet improvement criteria in both strength and functional domains. Notably  the number of responders increased to 90% when the definition included participants with improvements in at least one strength or functional outcome and 87% of participants reported improvements in quality of life with ARC-EX Therapy. There were no serious device-related adverse events observed during either the Up-LIFT trial or LIFT Home study.Up-LIFT and Lift Home study investigators recognized the importance of simplifying programming processes for their peers. We are very excited to share the insights we gained through the first large-scale study of transcutaneous spinal stimulation with clinicians said Chet Moritz  PhD  co-Principal Investigator of the Up-LIFT trial  publication co-author  and Professor of Electrical & Computer Engineering and Rehabilitation Medicine at the University of Washington. These programming insights were developed based on our experience with 60 participants in the Up-LIFT trial  and we expect them to be very helpful in determining the optimal parameters for stimulation for a wide range of patients in the clinic.To learn more about ONWARD Medical's commitment to partnering with the SCI Community to develop innovative solutions for restoring movement  function  and independence after spinal cord injury  please visit ONWD.com.Moritz  Chet  et al.

Hybrid-powered vehicles harvest kinetic energy that would otherwise be lost during braking and deceleration. This energy is stored in a compact  lightweight battery and reused during acceleration  contributing to a more efficient driving experience.“We have a very competitive hybrid solution that we are now ramping up with our new eDCT technology and we are rolling it out across a wide range of models  making it accessible to many customers ” said Sébastien Jacquet  Stellantis Deputy Chief Engineering Officer. “Hybrids are easy to use and don’t require any change in driving habits compared to traditional internal combustion engine vehicles. Our advanced eDCT technology allows the internal combustion engine to remain off  particularly during low-speed driving  resulting in reduced CO 2 emissions and fuel consumption. This is not just innovation; it’s innovation within reach of everyone.”eDCT Hybrid Advanced TechnologyMost Stellantis-brand hybrid vehicles in Europe are now equipped with the state-of-the-art eDCT tech and its integrated 21-kW electric motor  providing an exceptionally seamless and easy driving experience  including pure electric driving  for example in city driving conditions. The electric motor enables the vehicle to travel with the internal combustion engine turned off during driving. The system’s 48-volt  0.9-kWh battery delivers up to 1 km of range in steady driving and can also provide some electric propulsion during light-load cruising or coasting. During coasting and braking  the electric motor switches to a generator function  capturing kinetic energy and feeding electricity into the battery. A Belt Starter Generator enables a swift and seamless transition between electric mode and hybrid one.The eDCT-based hybrid powertrain system is engineered for optimal fuel efficiency  achieving up to 20% reduction in CO 2 emissions compared to a combustion engine with an automatic transmission. Thanks to its modularity  the innovative eDCT concept can also support plug-in electric vehicles due to a 93% commonality of components  changing only the electric drive module and inverter.Stellantis is currently producing hybrid vehicles in more than 70% of its plants in Europe. Through the eTransmissions joint venture  Stellantis and its partner currently produce eDCTs in Metz  France  and Turin  Italy  suppling 11 vehicle manufacturing plants. Combined production capacity is over 1.2 million eDCTs per year.Stellantis is investing more than €50 billion worldwide in electrification over the decade to deliver on the Dare Forward 2030 targets of reaching a 100% passenger car battery electric vehicle (BEV) sales mix in Europe and 50% passenger car and light-duty truck BEV sales mix in the United States by 2030. To achieve these sales targets  the Company is securing approximately 400 GWh of battery capacity  including support from battery manufacturing plants in North America and Europe. Stellantis is on track to become a carbon net zero corporation by 2038  all scopes included  with single-digit percentage compensation of remaining emissions.# # #About StellantisStellantis N.V.

The Company will offer 30 hybrid models this year and plans to introduce six more through 2026. Hybrid variants deliver exceptional driving experience while ensuring reduced CO2 emissions at a more affordable price point than fully electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles.Stellantis achieved a 41% sales increase in EU30 hybrid models year-to-date 2024 versus year-to-date 20231 and expects an increase in customer take rate with the upcoming new launches. Stellantis is the sales leader for low emission vehicles  which includes battery electric  fuel cell  plug-in hybrid and hybrid  in the EU30 for A and B segments and light commercial vehicles.In an era where sustainability meets innovation  Stellantis remains at the forefront with our ultimate commitment to advancing hybrid technology for our European customers  said Uwe Hochgeschurtz  Stellantis Chief Operating Officer  Enlarged Europe. This technology not only enhances the efficiency and performance of traditional combustion engines  it also propels us toward a future of lower emissions  extended vehicle range and overall affordability for our customers.Stellantis-brand Hybrid Vehicles Available Now or Coming Later This Year in Europe:Alfa Romeo Junior and TonaleCitroÃ«n New C3  New C3 AirCross  C4  C4X  C5 AirCross  C5XDS 3 and DS 4Fiat Panda and 600Jeep ® Avenger  Renegade and CompassNew Lancia YpsilonMaserati GrecaleOpel/Vauxhall Corsa  Astra  Astra SportsTourer  Mokka  Frontera  New GrandlandPeugeot (OTC: ) 208  308  308 SW  408  2008  New 3008  New 5008Stellantis Hybrid ModelsStellantis offers a range of technologies - hybrid  plug-in hybrid and fully electric - by leveraging its multi-energy manufacturing footprint to ensure a suitable option for various customer preferences  driving needs and vehicle sizes. Hybrid-powered vehicles harvest kinetic energy that would otherwise be lost during braking and deceleration. This energy is stored in a compact  lightweight battery and reused during acceleration  contributing to a more efficient driving experience.We have a very competitive hybrid solution that we are now ramping up with our new eDCT technology and we are rolling it out across a wide range of models  making it accessible to many customers  said SÃ©bastien Jacquet  Stellantis Deputy Chief Engineering Officer. Hybrids are easy to use and don't require any change in driving habits compared to traditional internal combustion engine vehicles. Our advanced eDCT technology allows the internal combustion engine to remain off  particularly during low-speed driving  resulting in reduced CO2 emissions and fuel consumption. This is not just innovation; it's innovation within reach of everyone.eDCT Hybrid Advanced TechnologyMost Stellantis-brand hybrid vehicles in Europe are now equipped with the state-of-the-art eDCT tech and its integrated 21-kW electric motor  providing an exceptionally seamless and easy driving experience  including pure electric driving  for example in city driving conditions. The electric motor enables the vehicle to travel with the internal combustion engine turned off during driving. The system's 48-volt  0.9-kWh battery delivers up to 1 km of range in steady driving and can also provide some electric propulsion during light-load cruising or coasting. During coasting and braking  the electric motor switches to a generator function  capturing kinetic energy and feeding electricity into the battery. A Belt Starter Generator enables a swift and seamless transition between electric mode and hybrid one.The eDCT-based hybrid powertrain system is engineered for optimal fuel efficiency  achieving up to 20% reduction in CO2 emissions compared to a combustion engine with an automatic transmission. Thanks to its modularity  the innovative eDCT concept can also support plug-in electric vehicles due to a 93% commonality of components  changing only the electric drive module and inverter.Stellantis is currently producing hybrid vehicles in more than 70% of its plants in Europe. Through the eTransmissions joint venture  Stellantis and its partner currently produce eDCTs in Metz  France  and Turin  Italy  suppling 11 vehicle manufacturing plants. Combined production capacity is over 1.2 million eDCTs per year.Stellantis is investing more than €50 billion worldwide in electrification over the decade to deliver on the Dare Forward 2030 targets of reaching a 100% passenger car battery electric vehicle (BEV) sales mix in Europe and 50% passenger car and light-duty truck BEV sales mix in the United States by 2030. To achieve these sales targets  the Company is securing approximately 400 GWh of battery capacity  including support from battery manufacturing plants in North America and Europe. Stellantis is on track to become a carbon net zero corporation by 2038  all scopes included  with single-digit percentage compensation of remaining emissions.# # #About StellantisStellantis N.V.

The announcement comes as the company hit the milestone of 2 million hours of fermentation in its R&D lab.JÃ©rÃ©my PESSIOT  Managing Director  R&D Director and co-founder of AFYREN  said: ""We have drawn our inspiration from natural ecosystems  where nothing is lost  nothing is created  and everything is transformed  to build a lean  high-performance technology based on extracting value from biomass. Over 12 years of applied research into the control of methanization in the laboratory  we have developed an industrial-scale fermentation process that is unique in its category. Today  we are continuing to invest in research to identify new ways of extracting value from biomass. This strategy should enable us to secure various sources of raw materials and replicate a profitable industrial model in a diverse array of geographical regions  with a focus on short supply chains.""A unique technology based on biomimicryBased on a decade of research in chemistry and biology and protected worldwide by 10 patent families  the AFYNERIE ® process converts a wide range of organic raw materials into bio-based molecules using natural  non-genetically modified micro-organisms.Inspired by living organisms and entirely biomimetic  the process reproduces on an industrial scale the fermentation that has been around for millions of years in natural ecosystems and on which  for example  the methanization process  used today for energy production  is based.AFYREN's expertise lies in controlling the transformation of the bio-based raw material to promote the production of carboxylic acids. The acids are extracted then processed through separation and purification stages to obtain products that meet industry specifications and current regulations.This quality is at the heart of the 'drop-in' approach  which enables direct replacement of petro-based molecules by bio-based molecules in our clients' existing production process. The end products are commonly found for example in food products or cosmetics  opening up markets that go well beyond those offered by methanization.60 biomass families identified and available to support AFYREN's international development and secure its supply of raw materialsOn the strength of its successful experience in valorizing by-products from the sugar industry at the AFYREN NEOXY plant in France  AFYREN is continuing its work to identify new sources of raw materials.Since the company was founded  AFYREN's R&D teams  made up of chemists and biologists  have carried out tests on more than 300 potential raw materials made available by the players and partners in the agri-food and farming industries around the world.These tests have enabled AFYREN to qualify 60 families of biomass (agricultural by-products  by-products of the food industry  etc.) that can be transformed into 100% bio-based molecules on an industrial scale. The recent partnership signed with SUEZ even paves the way for the recovery of household organic waste.This work proves that a wide range of organic raw materials can be upcycled in this way  even though they were originally considered to be of little use. This work  carried out on samples from all over the world  is crucial for international development at AFYREN  whose strategy is based on short supply chains with regional sourcing.Innovation fully dedicated to the development of new circular value chainsAFYREN's innovation approach is based on three strategic pillars. Each project must aim to improve processes  support international expansion by exploring new biomass families  or contribute to the development of innovative products and derivatives. For this work  partnerships are often the preferred option.Within this framework  R&D is working in particular on perfecting processes to optimize yields and make AFYREN's industrial solution more competitive. Working closely with the business development team  the R&D teams are also trying to expand the company's portfolio of acids and their derivatives. The acids produced by AFYREN are platform molecules which  thanks to additional green chemistry steps (esterification  hydrogenation  etc.) can be transformed into derivatives and new products.AFYREN's innovation portfolio currently comprises around ten projects aimed at developing partnerships for new products and circular value chains. It follows an eco-design rationale  incorporating corporate social responsibility (CSR) performance criteria such as carbon footprint  energy mix or the nature of raw materials and their transport.About AFYRENAFYREN is a French greentech company launched in 2012 to meet the challenge of decarbonizing industrial supplies. Its natural  innovative and proprietary fermentation technology valorizes local biomass from non-food agricultural co-products  replacing petro-sourced ingredients usually used in many product formulations. AFYREN's 100% biobased  low-carbon and sustainable solutions can meet decarbonization challenges in a wide variety of strategic sectors: human and animal nutrition  flavors and fragrances  life sciences and materials  and lubricants and technical fluids. AFYREN's plug-and-play  circular technology combines sustainability and competitiveness  with no need for manufacturers to change their processes.The Group's first French plant  AFYREN NEOXY  a joint venture with Bpifrance's SPI fund  is located in the Grand-Est region of France  in Saint Avold  serving mainly the European market.AFYREN is also pursuing a project in Thailand with a world leader in the sugar industry  and is developing its presence in the Americas  following up on distribution agreements it has already signed.At the end of 2023  AFYREN employed about 120 people in Lyon  Clermont-Ferrand and Carling Saint-Avold. The company invests 20% of its annual budget in R&D to further develop its sustainable solutions.AFYREN has been listed on the Euronext Growth ® exchange in Paris since 2021 (ISIN code: FR0014005AC9  mnemonic: ALAFY).Find out more: afyren.comView source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240708264473/en/AFYRENCommunicationCaroline Petignycaroline.petigny@afyren.comInvestor RelationsMark Reinhardinvest@afyren.comNewCapInvestor RelationsThÃ©o Martin / Mathilde BohinTÃ©l : 01 44 71 94 94afyren@newcap.euNewCapMedia Relations FranceNicolas MerigeauTÃ©l : 01 44 71 94 98afyren@newcap.euBogert-MagnierInternational Media RelationsJames ConnellTÃ©l : +33 6 2152 1755Jim@bogert-magnier.comSource: AFYREN",neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,negative,0.0,0.29,0.7,True,English,"['New Raw Materials', 'Fermentation Lab', '2-Million-Hour Mark', 'Industrial Expansion', 'AFYREN', 'Fuel', 'Investing', 'JÃ©rÃ©my PESSIOT', 'additional green chemistry steps', 'new circular value chains', 'household organic waste', 'three strategic pillars', 'R&D lab', 'R&D teams', 'short supply chains', 'lean, high-performance technology', 'Flexible feedstock sources', 'R&D Director', 'organic raw materials', '300 potential raw materials', 'natural, low-carbon ingredients', 'bio-based raw material', 'profitable industrial model', 'business development team', 'existing production process', 'AFYREN NEOXY plant', 'unique fermentation technology', 'industrial-scale fermentation process', 'new biomass families', 'circular model', 'unique technology', 'new sources', 'bio-based ingredients', 'industrial-scale production', 'BUSINESS WIRE', 'Managing Director', 'new ways', 'natural ecosystems', 'various sources', 'industrial expansion', 'bio-based molecules', 'industrial scale', 'industrial solution', 'biomimetic process', 'AFYNERIE ® process', 'new products', 'international expansion', 'Regulatory News', '2 million hours', 'diverse array', 'geographical regions', '10 patent families', 'wide range', 'living organisms', 'energy production', 'purification stages', 'industry specifications', 'current regulations', 'direct replacement', 'petro-based molecules', 'successful experience', 'sugar industry', 'farming industries', 'food industry', 'recent partnership', 'little use', 'regional sourcing', 'platform molecules', 'ten projects', 'Unique expertise', 'innovative approach', '60 biomass families', 'international development', 'end products', 'food products', 'innovative products', 'partnership framework', 'methanization process', 'innovation approach', 'greentech company', 'carboxylic acids', 'innovation portfolio', 'innovation strategy', '60 families', '12 years', 'research', 'inception', 'CLERMONT-FERRAND', 'France', 'LYON', 'Paris', 'ALAFY', 'manufacturers', 'announcement', 'milestone', 'founder', 'inspiration', 'everything', 'control', 'laboratory', 'category', 'focus', 'biomimicry', 'decade', 'biology', 'genetically', 'micro-organisms', 'millions', 'example', 'transformation', 'separation', 'quality', 'heart', 'cosmetics', 'markets', 'strength', 'chemists', 'biologists', 'tests', 'players', 'agri-food', 'world', 'agricultural', 'SUEZ', 'recovery', 'samples', 'processes', 'derivatives', 'partnerships', 'option', 'perfecting', 'yields', 'esterification', 'hydrogenation']",2024-07-09,2024-07-10,investing.com

With sales of €3.2 million (i.e.  20 implants) in the first 6 months of the year  we have already exceeded our 2023 annual sales; and the trajectory is extremely encouraging  with twice as many implants in the second quarter as in the first.With 14 implants since January 1st and a total of 25 since its initiation  the momentum of our EFICAS study in France is excellent. We expect to pass the halfway mark of the targeted 52 inclusions in the study very soon  which means we can anticipate completing these inclusions in the first half of 2025. This progress demonstrates that  once introduced to Aeson ®  healthcare professionals rapidly adopt the therapy  which is a positive signal for our ongoing commercial development.Building on these achievements  on a European network of 42 hospitals trained for commercial implants  on 3 commercially active countries (Germany  Italy  and Poland) and 6 others now ready  as well as on our growing and convincing clinical experience (70 implants carried out since the inception of CARMAT)  I am confident that our sales will continue to grow gradually  quarter after quarter; and this  all the more as awareness around Aeson ® is growing  notably driven by spontaneous communication from many centers that have implanted Aeson ®.I would like to thank our teams for their commitment and determination  and all our shareholders  whose support make these advances possible. More than ever  we remain resolutely committed to making CARMAT a leader in the field of advanced heart failure.""Marked acceleration in sales20 Aeson ® implants were performed in the first half of 2024  versus 3 in the first half of 2023. The pace of Aeson ® implants reached 4 per month in the second quarter of this year  doubling from 2 hearts per month in the first quarter.In the first 6 months of 2024  CARMAT generated sales of €3.2 million  already exceeding the annual sales for 2023 ( €2.8 million).Sales were achieved for the first time in Poland  bringing the number of commercially active countries to 3 (Germany  Italy  and Poland). A total of 9 hospitals implanted Aeson ® for the first time in 2024  including 4 in Germany  3 in France and 2 in Poland.This very positive trend reflects an encouraging spread of the therapy across Europe.Excellent momentum in EFICAS studySince the beginning of 2024  14 Aeson ® implants1 were made as part of the EFICAS study in France  at a pace of more than 2 implants per month.This brings the total number of Aeson ® implants performed to date in this study to 25  which paves the way for the imminent completion of half of the targeted recruitments  i.e. 52 patients in total.All French centers taking part in the study (10 in total2) have already referred patients  and 9 of them have performed at least one implant. The hospitals of Lille  Rennes  and the HÃ´pital EuropÃ©en Georges Pompidou (HEGP) in Paris have each already carried out 5 implantations  which reflects the marked satisfaction of healthcare professionals with the therapy  as they become familiar with Aeson ® and identifying eligible patients.CARMAT anticipates publishing the results of the EFICAS study in the last quarter of 2025. The Company believes that this will lead to a strong and sustained acceleration in the adoption of Aeson ® in Europe.EFICAS is also a key study both for securing reimbursement for Aeson ® in France and obtaining the ""PMA"" (marketing authorization in the United States issued by the FDA - Food & Drug Administration)  which the Company anticipates in 2027.Business development continuesIn the first half of 2024  CARMAT trained 9 new hospitals for Aeson ® commercial implants  expanding its network to 42 centers in 14 different countries3. The Company is thus well on track to meet its target of 50 trained hospitals by the end of 2024.Of these 42 centers  three-quarters are active  having already submitted patient scanners to CARMAT to assess patients' eligibility for implantation.In addition  6 countries (Switzerland  Austria  Slovenia  Croatia  Greece  and Israel) have now been activated and are therefore ready to carry out implants. The Company plans to activate more countries in Europe in the second half of the year.OutlookWith over 70 patients implanted since inception  corresponding to 27 patient-years  CARMAT benefits from substantial and convincing clinical experience with Aeson ®  which continues to confirm the technology's unique performance and safety profile  even though the Company tends to treat patients at an increasingly severe stage of the disease.Based on this promising set of clinical data  Aeson ® benefits from a growing reputation within the medical community  particularly supported by a ripple effect between centers  spontaneous positive communication from physicians and institutions performing implants  and CARMAT's regular presence at medical and scientific conferences and forums.Building on this experience and visibility  as well as on the on-going development of a very solid network of trained hospitals across Europe (three-quarters of which are already active)  the Company is confident in the gradual spread of its technology in Europe. This should be further strengthened  from the end of 2025  by a key catalyst i.e. the publication of the results of the EFICAS study  the largest ever conducted by CARMATFor the second half of 2024  CARMAT anticipates that the quarterly sales growth observed in the first part of the year will continue to reach annual sales of around €14 million.CARMAT's cash runway currently extends to the end of September 2024  and the Company continues to work very actively on securing the financial resources it needs to pursue its development beyond this timeframe.Next financial press release2024 Half-Year Results: September 30  2024 (before stock market opening)About CARMATCARMAT is a French MedTech that designs  manufactures and markets the Aeson ® artificial heart.
