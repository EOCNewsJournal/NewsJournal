It will support Crossject's innovative project to accelerate the development of its ZENEO® Epinephrine1 needle-free autoinjector  and save lives thanks to this new emergency treatment administered by a patient or its family in the event of severe allergic reactions (anaphylactic shock).The project  which runs until 2026  consists of subsidies for 60% of the total  and of subsidized loans for the remainder  with an initial payment of 1.7 million euros scheduled in the coming weeks  a development milestone of 4 million euros expected in August 2025 and the balance at the end of the project in 2026. The product is expected to generate cumulative sales of around 1 billion euros by 2032 for Crossject and its distributors  contribute to the creation of more than 160 jobs over the period 2024-2032  and support Crossject's actions to reduce the carbon footprint of ZENEO® Epinephrine. The project was also certified by the French cluster PMT.The drug solution in ZENEO® Epinephrine is innovative and patented by Crossject (FR3095122B1  WO2020212381A1). Importantly  it relies on a proprietary sulfite-free formulation. Sulfites are used as preservatives in many current products and are known to trigger intolerance  or even allergy  which can lead to an anaphylactic shock  the very event that needs to be treated. Moreover  Crossject’s new solution shows superior shelf-life performance and should enable a longer stability period compared to current drugs. The formulation developed by Crossject should hence not only reassure patients about the risk of drug-related allergy  but also meet their strong need for a simpler device that can be kept for longer.In addition  the ZENEO® auto-injector ensures a simple  complete injection of the entire dose in just a few milliseconds  with negligible residual volume. This should be a significant advantage over needle-based systems on the market.Patrick Alexandre  CEO of Crossject  declared: « We are honoured to be supported by the France 2030 innovation Plan. It bears witness to the innovative nature of our know-how and the impact that our innovations can have on healthcare. I would like to thank the French Government for its confidence  which reinforces the strategic dimension and promise of our needle-free injection technology.

This selectivity exceeds that of other existing e-SAF technologies.SAFs and e-SAFs are regulated by the European Union's ReFuelEU Aviation regulation. By 2030  aircrafts taking off from European airports will be required to carry on average in their tank:- 4.8% bio-SAF  produced from plant resources  mandate which includes Global Bioenergies' bio-SAF process from plant resources  and- 1.2% e-SAF produced from CO2 and low-carbon electricity  mandate which includes Global Bioenergies' e-SAF process.Marc Delcourt  co-founder and CEO of Global Bioenergies  commented: ""The prospect of producing not only bio-SAFs  but also e-SAFs  adds another string to our bow. In regions where plant resources are abundant (USA  Brazil  South-East Asia...)  our bio-SAF approach will have an important role to play. In regions where plant resources are only available in limited quantities  our e-SAF approach will be deployed primarily: this is the case in Europe and North Asia in particular.""Eva van Mastbergen  Team Lead R&D at SkyNRG  said: ""Given the growing global demand for SAF  driven by the ReFuelEU mandate and rising SAF ambitions  the industry must increase production and diversify technologies to convert various sustainable feedstocks into SAF. Following our successful collaboration on AS™ qualification of Global Bioenergies' SAF platform  we commend recent innovations supporting both bio-based SAF and e-SAF  advancing a more sustainable aviation industry.A new resource for the process: acetic acidAcetic acid (AcOH) is well known to the general public as the acid in vinegar.In summary  it involves feeding the bacterial strains producing isobutene (then transformed into SAF by simple oligomerization)  no longer with plant resources  but with acetic acid.Most of the 5 million tonnes of acetic acid produced every year is obtained by combining methanol and carbon monoxide  which can both be produced from CO2 and hydrogen. (Hydrogen can be produced by electrolysis of water using low-carbon electricity).This approach is therefore in line with the specifications of e-SAFs  defined by the use of CO2 and low-carbon electricity.AcOH  a new raw material for microorganismsMicroorganisms naturally break down sugar (usually six-carbon) into acetic groups (two-carbon)  which are then converted into numerous other molecules useful to life (fatty acids and amino acids  in particular). Although AcOH is well known to micro-organisms  which produce it endogenously  these micro-organisms are not naturally organized to use it as a resource massively supplied exogenously.It was therefore necessary to modify isobutene-producing strains so that they could accept AcOH  which has been successfully achieved in recent months.e-AcOH  a resource that could soon be available on a large scaleA major player in the industrial production of AcOH is already producing e-AcOH based on CO2 captured from industrial effluent gases  combined with low-carbon hydrogen.What stage of development has the e-SAF process reached?The process is now moving from proof of concept to pre-industrial development.At the same time  the performance of Global Bioenergies' bio-SAF process has improved significantly in recent months  and this progress has been transposed to the pilot scale. It will continue to improve over the coming months  to approach the theoretical optimum. The progress made on the bio-SAF process will be transposed to the performance of the e-SAF process.The competitive advantages of Global Bioenergies' e-SAF processToday  there is no industrial-scale production of e-SAF  and no aircraft has yet flown fully on e-SAF.Two families of e-SAF production processes are currently being developed by various players. Both are based on chemical approaches:- The first uses the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis process - The second involves the production of e-methanol  which is then converted into e-SAF.In both cases  the selectivity of the process to SAF is lower than Global Bioenergies' e-SAF process  meaning a larger fraction of side-products will be marketed as e-gasoline or e-diesel  at a lower price.Global Bioenergies' e-SAF process provides an answer here: over 95% of the products from its process correspond to the aviation stream  which would benefit the industrial profitability of the corresponding plants.ConclusionThis breakthrough in biology paves the way to a new e-SAF process  distinguished from other e-SAF technologies by its very high selectivity. It adds a valuable string to Global Bioenergies's bow  as it ensures a diversity of supply sources and a highly differentiated position in this emerging market.About GLOBAL BIOENERGIESGlobal Bioenergies substitutes products of fossil origin with products of natural origin. In their quest for naturalness without compromising on performance  the cosmetics players are the Company's first customers. By 2027  the Company will be operating its innovative process in a large-scale plant. By 2030  the Company plans to become a leader in the huge emerging market for sustainable aviation fuels  in order to fight against global warming. Global Bioenergies is listed on Euronext Growth in Paris (FR0011052257 - ALGBE). L'OrÃ©al is its largest shareholder  with a 13.5% stake.About SkyNRGSkyNRG is a global leader in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF). Since 2009  the company has been scaling up SAF demand and production capacity for the industry to meet its 2050 net zero commitment. SkyNRG was the first in the world to supply SAF on a commercial flight flown by co-founder and shareholder KLM in 2011.

This selectivity exceeds that of other existing e-SAF technologies.SAFs and e-SAFs are regulated by the European Union's ReFuelEU Aviation regulation. By 2030  aircrafts taking off from European airports will be required to carry on average in their tank:- 4.8% bio-SAF  produced from plant resources  mandate which includes Global Bioenergies' bio-SAF process from plant resources  and- 1.2% e-SAF produced from CO 2 and low-carbon electricity  mandate which includes Global Bioenergies’ e-SAF process.Marc Delcourt  co-founder and CEO of Global Bioenergies  commented: ""The prospect of producing not only bio-SAFs  but also e-SAFs  adds another string to our bow. In regions where plant resources are abundant (USA  Brazil  South-East Asia...)  our bio-SAF approach will have an important role to play. In regions where plant resources are only available in limited quantities  our e-SAF approach will be deployed primarily: this is the case in Europe and North Asia in particular.""Eva van Mastbergen  Team Lead R&D at SkyNRG  said: ""Given the growing global demand for SAF  driven by the ReFuelEU mandate and rising SAF ambitions  the industry must increase production and diversify technologies to convert various sustainable feedstocks into SAF. Following our successful collaboration on ASTM qualification of Global Bioenergies’ SAF platform  we commend recent innovations supporting both bio-based SAF and e-SAF  advancing a more sustainable aviation industry.”A new resource for the process: acetic acidAcetic acid (“AcOH”) is well known to the general public as the acid in vinegar.In summary  it involves feeding the bacterial strains producing isobutene (then transformed into SAF by simple oligomerization)  no longer with plant resources  but with acetic acid.Most of the 5 million tonnes of acetic acid produced every year is obtained by combining methanol and carbon monoxide  which can both be produced from CO 2 and hydrogen. (Hydrogen can be produced by electrolysis of water using low-carbon electricity).This approach is therefore in line with the specifications of e-SAFs  defined by the use of CO 2 and low-carbon electricity.AcOH  a new raw material for microorganismsMicroorganisms naturally break down sugar (usually six-carbon) into acetic groups (two-carbon)  which are then converted into numerous other molecules useful to life (fatty acids and amino acids  in particular). Although AcOH is well known to micro-organisms  which produce it endogenously  these micro-organisms are not naturally organized to use it as a resource massively supplied exogenously.It was therefore necessary to modify isobutene-producing strains so that they could accept AcOH  which has been successfully achieved in recent months.e-AcOH  a resource that could soon be available on a large scaleA major player in the industrial production of AcOH is already producing e-AcOH based on CO 2 captured from industrial effluent gases  combined with low-carbon hydrogen.What stage of development has the e-SAF process reached?The process is now moving from proof of concept to pre-industrial development.At the same time  the performance of Global Bioenergies' bio-SAF process has improved significantly in recent months  and this progress has been transposed to the pilot scale. It will continue to improve over the coming months  to approach the theoretical optimum. The progress made on the bio-SAF process will be transposed to the performance of the e-SAF process.The competitive advantages of Global Bioenergies' e-SAF processToday  there is no industrial-scale production of e-SAF  and no aircraft has yet flown fully on e-SAF.Two families of e-SAF production processes are currently being developed by various players. Both are based on chemical approaches:- The first uses the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis process - The second involves the production of e-methanol  which is then converted into e-SAF.In both cases  the selectivity of the process to SAF is lower than Global Bioenergies’ e-SAF process  meaning a larger fraction of side-products will be marketed as e-gasoline or e-diesel  at a lower price.Global Bioenergies' e-SAF process provides an answer here: over 95% of the products from its process correspond to the aviation stream  which would benefit the industrial profitability of the corresponding plants.ConclusionThis breakthrough in biology paves the way to a new e-SAF process  distinguished from other e-SAF technologies by its very high selectivity. It adds a valuable string to Global Bioenergies’s bow  as it ensures a diversity of supply sources and a highly differentiated position in this emerging market.About GLOBAL BIOENERGIESGlobal Bioenergies substitutes products of fossil origin with products of natural origin.

Secondary endpoints will include analysis of mobility (via the 6-minute walk test) and body composition (assessment of fat and lean mass). A world-renowned medical expert in the field of obesity and President-elect of the American Obesity Society  Marc-André Cornier  Professor of Medicine and Director of the Endocrinology  Diabetes and Metabolic Diseases Unit at the Medical University of South Carolina  will be the principal investigator of the phase 2 OBA study.Professor Marc-André Cornier commented: ""I am very happy that the IND for the phase 2 OBA clinical study with BIO101 (20-hydroxyecdysone) has been approved by the FDA. It is critical for us to study the safety and efficacy of new therapies designed to reduce the risk of muscle mass loss and resulting muscle weakness with functional consequences that may be associated with incretin-based therapies. Additionally we might observe further weight loss over and above that obtainable with a GLP-1 RA.""The multicenter study is due to start mid-2024 in the USA and could be extended to Europe. Preliminary results on the efficacy of BIO101 (20-hydroxyecdysone) are expected in 2025. Biophytis is seeking funding and partnerships to complete this study.Stanislas Veillet  CEO de Biophytis  stated: ""Obesity represents a major medical challenge and a significant growth opportunity for Biophytis. The obesity treatment market  estimated at $6 billion in 2023  is expected to reach $100 billion by 2030  with an average annual growth rate of 42%. Obtaining an IND from the FDA is a crucial step that will enable us to make rapid progress in this indication and attract new pharmaceutical partners. We are convinced that BIO101 could become a reference treatment for preserving muscle mass  strength and function in obese patients treated with GLP-1 RAs. This development has convinced our partner Blanver in Latin America  and we are convinced that it will attract new ones in other regions of the world where obesity is a major health issue.""****About BIOPHYTISBiophytis SA is a clinical-stage biotechnology company specializing in the development of drug candidates for age-related diseases.
