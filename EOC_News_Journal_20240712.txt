In case of any discrepancies between this translation and the Swedish original  the latter shall prevail.UPPSALA  Sweden  July 11  2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The shareholders of Olink Holding AB (publ) (the ""Company"")  reg. no. 559189-7755  are hereby given notice to attend the Extra General Meeting to be held at 4:00 p.m. CEST on Tuesday 6 August 2024  in the Company's facilities at Salagatan 16F  Uppsala.

Personal data is handled in accordance with the Data Protection Regulation (European Parliament and Council Regulation (EU) 2016/679). For full information regarding the Company's handling of personal data  please refer to our privacy policy: https://www.olink.com/about-us/integrity-policy/.To be entitled to participate in the General Meeting a shareholder whose shares are registered in the name of a nominee must  in addition to providing notification of participation at the General Meeting  register its shares in its own name so that the shareholder is recorded in the share register on Monday 29 July 2024. Such registration may be temporary (so-called voting right registration) and is requested with the nominee in accordance with the nominee's procedures and such time in advance as the nominee determines. Voting right registrations completed not later than Wednesday 31 July 2024 are taken into account when preparing the share register.The Company intends to enable shareholders to participate electronically via link. It should however be noted that such a procedure presupposes that the General Meeting first approves that pre-registered persons participate via link. In the case of participation via link  there is no support for managing the voting register  which means that if participants via link actively want to influence the Extra General Meeting's decisions  this must be done by the shareholder issuing a power of attorney to a person who physically participates in the Extra General Meeting. If there are registered persons on Wednesday 31 July 2024 that wish to participate via link  the Company will send out an invitation with instructions on how to join the Extra General Meeting electronically.OPPORTUNITY FOR SHAREHOLDERS TO EXERCISE VOTING RIGHTS THROUGH PROXYShareholders who do not wish to attend the meeting in person may authorize a proxy to exercise their voting rights. A power of attorney may be issued to the Chairman of the Meeting or another person attending the Extra General Meeting. If the power of attorney is issued to the Chairman of the Meeting  the power of attorney must be combined with a voting instruction so that the Chairman of the Meeting knows how to vote under the various decision points. If the power of attorney is not combined with a voting instruction  the Chairman will not be able to represent the shareholder at the meeting. In other cases  the power of attorney should also be combined with a voting instruction. If participation will be by proxy  the shareholder shall issue a written  signed and dated power of attorney together with any documents verifying authority. Proxies for legal entities must also be accompanied by a certificate of incorporation or equivalent document verifying authority. A copy of the power of attorney  the voting instruction and any certificate of incorporation should  well in advance of the meeting  be sent to the Company at the above address. The original power of attorney shall also be presented at the meeting  as applicable. The Company provides the shareholders with proxy forms as well as blank voting instructions  which can be obtained at the Company's head office or on the Company's website www.investors.olink.com on Tuesday 16 July 2024 at the latest.Note that the possibility of having a proxy exercise the shareholders' voting rights at the Extra General Meeting presupposes that the shareholder has made a notification of participation and is included in the share register in accordance with what is stated above under the heading ""Notice of participation"". It is thus not sufficient to simply submit a power of attorney.PROPOSED AGENDAOpening of the Meeting. Election of Chairman to preside over the Meeting. Preparation and approval of voting register.

This partnership will see the deployment of Quadientâs Parcel Pending open locker network across 1 261 pub locations managed by Punch Pubs  enhancing the accessibility and convenience of parcel deliveries and returns for communities nationwide. This collaboration supports sustainable growth strategies  leveraging Punch Pubs' nationwide commercial properties to deliver value to local populations.Quadientâs approach to selecting optimal locations is based on detailed partner carrier data  to pinpoint areas with delivery bottlenecks and high population density. Within Punch Pubsâ network mapping  Quadient has already identified 400 premium locations as a starting point  with initial installations planned as soon as October. Punch Pubs  operating a tenanted and management partnership business  also benefits from Quadientâs support to provide publicans with clear information for a smooth and efficient adoption of the new smart lockers in their local pubs.âWe are thrilled to partner with Punch Pubs to extend our open locker network across the UK â said Katia Bourgeais CrÃ©mel  EVP Lockers Automation Platform Europe at Quadient. âThis new collaboration will greatly contribute to our mission to provide community-driven  sustainable solutions that enhance daily life.

With new services such as smart locker parcel collection and drop-off facilities  our publicans are able to better serve their guests in the community  enhancing their position as a central hub for social and economic activities  and reinforcing our pubâs position as a key player in the local economy.âBy bringing more convenience to local communities  Punch Pubs publicans are likely to experience increased foot traffic and positive customer engagement  while carriers benefit from streamlined operations  reducing congestion  delivery time and costs associated with last-mile deliveries and returns.

FS001 targets a novel tumor-associated antigen that is overexpressed in many solid tumors and plays a critical role in tumor proliferation and metastasis. This novel tumor antigen was identified using Foreseenâs high throughput  integrated translational proteomics  and artificial intelligence (AI)-powered screening platforms  to analyze their vast collection of well-characterized clinical tumor samples. FS001 utilized an innovative  stable and cleavable linker coupled to a potent topoisomerase I inhibitor. Preclinical efficacy of FS001 was demonstrated in multi-drug resistant cancer models. The agreement gives Ipsen exclusive worldwide rights to develop  manufacture and commercialize FS001.âWe are excited to add FS001  the second ADC Ipsen has in-licensed this year  to our growing pipeline. Using cutting-edge proteomics technology and AI-powered screening platforms the Foreseen team has uncovered a novel and clinically relevant target which could unlock the potential of ADCs for even more people living with hard-to-treat forms of cancer â said Mary Jane Hinrichs  SVP and Head of Early Development at Ipsen. âAs we prepare for the initiation of a Phase I clinical trial  we will evaluate FS001 in selected solid tumor types  which we hope will deliver critical new treatments for people living with cancer around the world.ââOur strategic partnership with Ipsen provides a strong endorsement to our high throughput integrated translational proteomics platform approach to discover and develop innovative therapeutic products with first-in-class potentialâ  said Catherine Wong  Founder and Chairman of Foreseen. âWe are pleased to be collaborating with Ipsen to advance FS001 globally  harnessing Ipsenâs robust track record in accelerating the clinical development and commercialization of innovative therapeutics.

The antibody selectively targets an identified tumor antigen. Payloads are the pharmaceutically active component to treat the cancer  attached to the antibody via a chemical linker. The linker connects the antibody and the payload and reduces the amount of payload that reaches non-tumor tissue.1About FS001FS001 is a potential first-in-class ADC with demonstrated preclinical efficacy in multiple solid tumors as well as a favorable safety profile with wide therapeutic window in animal studies. FS001 is comprised of (i) Foreseenâs proprietary antibody that specifically binds to a novel target identified using the companyâs high throughput integrated translational proteomics platform and (ii) an innovative linker-payload with excellent pharmaceutical features developed by Shanghai Escugen Biotechnology Co. Ltd.

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsenâs future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words âbelievesâ  âanticipatesâ and âexpectsâ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsenâs expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsenâs ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsenâs patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsenâs activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsenâs partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsenâs business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law. Ipsenâs business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French AutoritÃ© des MarchÃ©s Financiers. The risks and uncertainties set out are not exhaustive and the reader is advised to refer to Ipsenâs latest Universal Registration Document  available on ipsen.com.References1 E. Jabbour  S.

43728,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.investing.com/news/press-releases/eurofins-provides-update-to-key-stakeholders-on-current-and-upcoming-actions-following-communications-published-by-muddy-waters-since-24-june-2024-93CH-3514876,Eurofins Provides Update to Key Stakeholders on Current and Upcoming Actions Following Communications Published by Muddy Waters Since 24 June 2024 By Investing.com,Eurofins Provides Update to Key Stakeholders on Current and Upcoming Actions Following Communications Published by Muddy Waters Since 24 June 2024,LUXEMBOURG--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Regulatory News:Eurofins (Paris:ERF):As has been done in previous press releases published by Eurofins on 25 June 2024  03 July 2024 and 05 July 2024 in response to baseless reports by Muddy Waters (NYSE: )  LLC (MW)  Eurofins would like to provide clear and direct communication on subjects of greatest importance to its key stakeholders  including shareholders  bondholders  employees and customers  regarding MW earlier reports and MW's recent letter to Eurofins' CEO  Dr Gilles Martin. This approach is fully consistent with the Company's communication policies that adhere to strict rules to ensure that all investors simultaneously receive  through appropriate and accredited channels  reliable information that has been rigorously validated. This stands in contrast to the inaccurate  irrelevant  biased and/or misleading allegations made by MW in its reports  which Eurofins has thoroughly refuted in its previous press releases  and potentially also to various other baseless allegations made by MW and/or its clique of short sellers through alternative channels.Concerning related party transactions involving Analytical Bioventures SCA (ABSCA)  which is controlled by Dr Gilles Martin  Eurofins continues to access archives and information regarding older allegations and facts cited with errors by MW and plans to present investors  in due course  with further information on its real estate programme that provides confirmation of arm's length terms in transactions involving related parties  and can validate the following points complementing Eurofins' previous communication:As made clear in Eurofins' previous press releases  during the last 10 years  for each site expansion financed by ABSCA on an ABSCA-owned site  the lease terms for these additional properties were assessed to be at arm's length based on appraisals of comparable properties performed by independent external experts. Indeed  assessments to ensure that related party transactions are at arm's length has been a standard Eurofins practice since ABSCA started to finance buildings to be used by Eurofins companies in 2005 so Eurofins could use its resources to expand organically and through acquisitions at a time when its access to capital and credit was much more limited.Completely contrary to MW's false allegation that Eurofins funded expansions while Dr. Martin increased the rent charged for the larger facilities (p. 7 in MW report published 25 June 2024)  whenever Eurofins financed site improvements on laboratory campuses rented from ABSCA subsidiaries  there was of course no increase in lease payments made by Eurofins companies to ABSCA subsidiaries in connection to these improvements.Furthermore  as has already been discussed based on feedback from its investors as part of ongoing dialogue  it is planned to provide Eurofins the opportunity to acquire those ABSCA-owned sites that Eurofins companies wish to use long term  subject to a vote by non-related shareholders (i.e.  without the participation of ABSCA and its representative directors). The timeline for this process is dependent on numerous conditions  including the significant preparation work required (i.e.  appraisals by independent external experts) and Eurofins' financial development  but it is Eurofins' intention to conduct this vote at the earliest appropriate occasion. In order to proceed swiftly on this matter  while protecting the sustainability of its balance sheet within its stated financial leverage objectives with adequate headroom  Eurofins will prioritise  if required  the acquisition of ABSCA-owned sites  if so decided by a majority of its non-related shareholders  over the acquisition of new sites from third parties.Concerning MW's allegations regarding Eurofins' cash accounting  as already communicated in its press release published on 05 July 2024  Eurofins has mandated Ernst & Young Paris  one of the leading auditors for companies  to perform an additional independent audit of Eurofins' cash pooling arrangements and cash situation in its consolidated financial statements as at 31 December 2023  and will report on the findings when available.Concerning corporate governance  Eurofins is contemplating increasing the proportion of independent  non-executive directors on its Board of Directors by potentially adding one or more directors with appropriate experience and seniority. Among other factors  Eurofins will consider the qualifications  recognition and work experience of potential candidates  with any appointment subject to a shareholder vote at an Annual General Meeting.Going forward  Eurofins will continue to listen to serious requests from legitimate investors and other stakeholders but does not intend to further divert its resources to respond to irrelevant  biased and/or unfounded allegations or unreasonable requests by MW and similar actors.Comments from the CEO  Dr Gilles Martin:In its latest letter dated 09 July 2024 and addressed directly to me  MW proposed that transparency is the remedy to win investor trust. As MW should know  transparency for a public company such as Eurofins requires  among other factors  adherence to clear and strict rules regarding the reliability of information published as well as the method of dissemination  to avoid potential risks arising from  among other causes  insider trading or market manipulation. Based on what we have seen so far  it seems hard to conclude that MW adheres to a similarly high level of transparency and rigour. Rather than continue making false or misleading allegations against Eurofins or inappropriate and absurd requests for information  perhaps MW should instead consider if it is being transparent with its own practices and fulfilling its regulatory requirements in all relevant jurisdictions  assuming that its intentions extend beyond simply profiteering at the expense of investors  especially passive funds and individual investors who may be less familiar with the practices of short sellers. Since MW has never initiated a dialogue with Eurofins to discuss their assessments prior to publishing their communications  which could have prevented the spread of their incorrect and misleading information  we can only surmise that MW  and parties potentially acting together with MW  does not have any intentions other than to serve their own personal financial interests by deceiving the investing public.In contrast  Eurofins will continue to fulfil its obligation to provide clear and transparent communication through the appropriate channels and formats and after adequate verification and carefully considering the interests and suggestions of its investors and stakeholders. Therefore  going forward  we do not intend to expend further company resources to respond to MW's baseless allegations or arbitrary requests. Instead  our energy and attention are focussed not only on our strategic  operational and financial performance  but also on the aforementioned subjects of greatest importance to our key stakeholders. We look forward to discussing these topics with them in upcoming engagements  including at the time of our Half Year 2024 results publication on 24 July 2024.About Eurofins â the global leader in bio-analysisEurofins is Testing for Life.

43729,EuroNext,Bing API,https://www.businesspost.ie/news-focus/tom-maguire-tax-changes-that-could-boost-the-fortunes-of-euronext/,Tom Maguire: Tax changes that could boost the fortunes of Euronext,Daryl Byrne  Euronext Dublinâs chief executive (left)  Niall Jones  head of listings for Ireland & UK and Tom Maguire of Deloitte Daryl Byrne  the chief executive of Euronext  and Niall Jones  head of listings  set up an Irish equity market forum group ...,Daryl Byrne  the chief executive of Euronext  and Niall Jones  head of listings  set up an Irish equity market forum group consisting of various stakeholders from law firms  brokers  accountancy firms and more. The group  which Iâm part of  recently produced its pre-budget submission.At a recent meeting with them  at Euronext Dublin  I was struck by the buildingâs history. Byrne explained the Irish Stock Exchange (ISE) was founded in 1793 and is one of the oldest on the planet. It was one of the worldâs first exchanges to admit a female member  22-year-old Oonah Keogh  in 1925.It remained open through all of the significant events in Irish and European history  with the exception of some short closures during the world wars. Following a bombing of Dublin in January 1941  an air raid shelter was built in the basement of the exchange building.This column could discuss history all day  but down to business. Byrne and Jones are clearly focused on the important role that equity markets can play in supporting the growth of Irish companies.They argue that the lack of a sizeable and consistent pipeline of new companies  coupled with recently well-publicised departures  reflect their point that Irish equity markets are underused. Since 2014  the number of listed companies has shrunk by almost 40 per cent  while the loss of the two largest companies in the past 18 months saw the total market value of Euronext Dublin companies decrease by around â¬68 billion.They note that between 2020 and the launch of the forumâs pre-budget submission  two new IPOs alongside three other listings launched on the Irish equity capital market  compared to 68 in France  200+ in Sweden and the UK  and over 1 900 in the US.Both are keen to demonstrate the importance of the domestic equity market  noting that it provides access to a permanent source of capital for Irish companies. It ensures Irish companies remain grounded in and controlled from Ireland  bringing about the sectorâs continued exchequer contribution through various taxes.They also point out that it ensures the indigenous company sectorâs continued contribution to employment growth in Ireland  thereby de-risking FDI sector dependence. A Dublin listing is a European listing  and without the domestic equity market  Irelandâs ability to support scaling Irish enterprise would be damaged.In addition to initiatives Euronext is working on  both argue that coordinated efforts by government and market participants would create a more favourable domestic equity market environment for companies and investors. Therefore  the forumâs pre-budget submission outlines three main proposals  focused on retail investors  founders and the establishment of an Irish growth capital fund.On the retail side  this is where the GRA  or growth and returns account suggestion comes in. The GRA would ensure that gains and losses within the account arenât taxable or deductible. It would have a maximum annual contribution (similar to Italy) of â¬40 000 per qualifying individual with a five-year holding period.The GRA would invest in companies with a market capitalisation of less than â¬1.5 billion and similarly constituted funds. This means scaling companies considering an IPO know theyâll get access to otherwise unavailable funding.The pair argue that GRA accounts would be attractive for savers. Think of it as an Irish version of Britainâs individual savings accounts (ISAs) and youâll have the basic gist. On that note  the ISA scheme was set up in 1999 and the market value at the end of 2022 for certain ISAs stood at Â£741.6 billion.Further  the forum suggests an increase in the capital gains tax (CGT) tax-free allowance to â¬7 500. That might seem like a big increase until you realise it hasnât been updated in decades.According to Daryl Byrne  the second proposalâs objective is to create appropriate CGT incentives for Irish founders and entrepreneurs. It seeks to enhance angel investor relief brought about in the most recent Finance Act.The proposal also looks to enhance CGTâs entrepreneur relief (which taxes gains up to a limit at 10 per cent) by increasing that limit to â¬5 million  as well as allowing certain investors who are not employees or directors to qualify. The forum also suggests reducing the CGT rate to 20 per cent for gains arising on the disposal of all productive assets.An additional limb to the proposals recognises that the preparations in the lead up to an IPO can give rise to costly fees. Those potential costs can deter a company from pursuing this fundraising option.The forum suggests that incremental costs directly related to a stock exchange listing would be deductible for tax purposes  and benefit from a super deduction at a rate of 150 per cent for holding or trading companies seeking a listing even where the listing is deferred or aborted.The third proposal looks to establish an equity fund  supported by the Irish state  that delivers domestic equity capital to Irish companies seeking to fund growth using Irish equity markets. Byrne notes that the objective is to provide permanent capital to incentivise indigenous and strategically valuable companies to source evergreen equity financing through Euronext Dublin.Niall Jones adds that the fund would strengthen the financing capacity of the Irish equity market  promoting Dublin as an attractive market for non-Irish IPO candidates. With Irelandâs track record of creating specialist hubs (eg aircraft leasing) they see untapped potential here. They point out that those types of initiatives already exist or are being enhanced in other European countries.And then thereâs stamp duty. Both Byrne and Jones believe that full-scale abolition of stamp duty on trading in Irish shares is necessary. They argue that removing stamp duty would incentivise more investment in Irish companies  especially by international fund managers but also by local retail investors.Tom Maguire is a tax partner with Deloitte,neutral,0.45,0.53,0.02,negative,0.0,0.14,0.86,True,English,"['Tom Maguire', 'Tax changes', 'fortunes', 'Euronext', 'favourable domestic equity market environment', 'Irish equity market forum group', 'Irish equity capital market', 'Irish growth capital fund', 'domestic equity capital', '22-year-old Oonah Keogh', 'air raid shelter', 'total market value', 'scaling Irish enterprise', 'Irish equity markets', 'two new IPOs', 'angel investor relief', 'recent Finance Act', 'FDI sector dependence', 'Irish Stock Exchange', 'CGT) tax-free allowance', 'appropriate CGT incentives', 'three other listings', 'three main proposals', 'maximum annual contribution', 'five-year holding period', 'individual savings accounts', 'two largest companies', 'stock exchange listing', 'indigenous company sector', 'A Dublin listing', 'capital gains tax', 'equity fund', 'Euronext Dublin companies', 'market participants', 'market capitalisation', 'Irish version', 'Irish state', 'Irish companies', 'recent meeting', 'qualifying individual', 'entrepreneur relief', 'tax purposes', 'new companies', 'GRA accounts', 'exchange building', 'Irish founders', 'chief executive', 'various stakeholders', 'law firms', 'accountancy firms', 'pre-budget submission', 'first exchanges', 'female member', 'significant events', 'short closures', 'important role', 'consistent pipeline', '40 per cent', 'past 18 months', 'permanent source', 'exchequer contribution', 'European listing', 'retail side', 'unavailable funding', 'basic gist', 'ISA scheme', '10 per cent', '20 per cent', 'productive assets', 'additional limb', 'costly fees', 'potential costs', 'fundraising option', 'incremental costs', 'super deduction', '150 per cent', 'listed companies', 'trading companies', 'employment growth', 'The GRA', 'CGT rate', 'second proposal', 'third proposal', 'Niall Jones', 'world wars', 'various taxes', 'account suggestion', 'big increase', 'Daryl Byrne', 'European history', 'retail investors', 'head', 'brokers', 'planet', 'exception', 'bombing', 'January', 'basement', 'column', 'business', 'lack', 'sizeable', 'departures', 'point', 'number', 'loss', 'launch', 'France', 'Sweden', 'UK', 'importance', 'access', 'Ireland', 'ability', 'initiatives', 'coordinated', 'efforts', 'government', 'establishment', 'returns', 'Italy', 'funds', 'pair', 'savers', 'Britain', 'ISAs', 'note', 'decades', 'objective', 'entrepreneurs', 'limit', 'employees', 'directors', 'disposal', 'preparations', 'lead']",2024-07-12,2024-07-12,businesspost.ie
