43733,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://foreignpolicy.com/2024/07/12/sanctions-russia-western-companies-retaliation-putin-europe/,Western Companies Are Now Paying for Russia Sanctions,U.S. and European companies still have billions of dollars in assets in Russia—and Moscow is starting to retaliate.,After months of discussions over whether to confiscate Russian assets frozen in the West  G-7 nations decided in mid-June to use the future proceeds of those assets to provide a $50 billion loan to Ukraine. But that G-7 decision may leave Western companies still operating in Russia footing the bill for funding Ukraine.After months of discussions over whether to confiscate Russian assets frozen in the West  G-7 nations decided in mid-June to use the future proceeds of those assets to provide a $50 billion loan to Ukraine. But that G-7 decision may leave Western companies still operating in Russia footing the bill for funding Ukraine.Many Western businesses had pledged to leave Russia following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine but ended up remaining  as bureaucratic obstacles and the risk of potential losses increased. Some had their assets seized after announcing plans to leave. And now Russia has reacted to the G-7 decision by saying it has plenty of scope to retaliate.“Our country has significant amounts of Western funds and property that are under Russian jurisdiction—all of this may be subject to Russian retaliatory policies and retaliatory actions ” said Maria Zakharova  a spokesperson for Russia’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. “Of course  no one will disclose the nature of these retaliatory actions to you. But the arsenal of political and economic countermeasures is wide.”In this situation  Western companies find themselves stuck between a rock and hard place. They have few options to exit Russia  but by remaining  they face a higher chance of losing control of their assets there. “Against this background  they look like the losers ” said Alexandra Prokopenko  a fellow at Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center in Berlin.According to data collected by the Kyiv School of Economics and analyzed by Armin Steinbach  a nonresident fellow at the Brussels-based think tank Bruegel  European Union and U.S. companies have pulled out around 40 percent of their Russian assets since February 2022. Foreign assets worth around $194 billion are still in Russia. Of these assets  $32 billion worth are owned by U.S. companies  while $90 billion belong to European companies  the data showed.The businesses that remained are in different situations. Some said they would leave but then backtracked or put their plans on hold. Others reduced their operations in Russia  sometimes to a minimum  while the rest are still trying to exit the country.French industrial gas producer Air Liquide said in September 2022 that it had signed a memorandum of understanding to sell its Russian business to the local managers who were running it. The sale needs Russia’s regulatory approval  but the company told Foreign Policy that it had no update.U.K. consumer group Reckitt announced in April 2022 that it had begun to transfer the ownership of its Russian business. This process continues  the company said. However  in an interview with the Financial Times in April  its chief executive  Kris Licht  cautioned that selling its Russian operations had become more and more complex.Unilever  another British consumer group  said it is still reviewing its options  while Swiss food giant Nestlé said it continues to sell consumer goods in Russia but only “essential and basic foods.”All these companies said they scaled back their operations in Russia after it attacked Ukraine. “Even with reduced operations  some are making a profit  and this may partly explain why they remained. However  slowing down the exit process  not making statements about it  can also be part of the strategy to smoothly get out of this market ” Prokopenko said.Western sanctions have made it increasingly hard to find local buyers who are acceptable to both the seller and Russia’s authorities. In addition  Russia imposed a mandatory discount of 50 percent on assets from “unfriendly” countries sold to Russian buyers  plus a 15 percent exit tax.The corporate exodus of around 1 000 foreign companies from Russia since its 2022 invasion of Ukraine has cost them more than $107 billion in write-downs and lost revenue  according to a Reuters analysis of company filings and statements published at the end of March.It’s also almost impossible for Western businesses to send the profits made in Russia back to their headquarters. These funds must be held in special accounts in Russia  called C accounts. “I have spoken with dozens of foreign clients  and only two managed to repatriate this money ” said Nabi Abdullaev  a London-based partner at Control Risks  a consultancy.Many companies are conscious of the pain inflicted on some Western businesses after their assets were seized in response to announcements of plans to leave. Yogurt producer Danone and beer-maker Carlsberg were among the most prominent victims in 2023. Danone was able to clinch a deal to sell its Russian assets but at a steep discount  while Carlsberg remains embroiled in a protracted legal battle with Moscow. Meanwhile  it has written down the value of its Russian business to zero.More recently  when talks intensified at the G-7 level about the use of Russian assets and the United States passed the REPO for Ukrainians Act  allowing the government to confiscate Russian assets  Russia placed the Russian subsidiary of Italian water heating firm Ariston and German appliance-maker BSH Hausgeräte under the “temporary external management” of a Gazprom entity.These measures “were taken in response to hostile actions  contrary to international law  by the United States and other foreign states that have joined them  aimed at illegally depriving Russia  its legal entities and various individuals of the right to property” in those countries  the Russian Embassy in Rome said in a statement.G-7 nations haven’t finalized the details of how the financing of Ukraine will happen. The $50 billion multiyear loan to Ukraine agreed on in June is expected to reach Kyiv by the end of this year  with contributions from all G-7 states.The assets would remain immobilized until Moscow ended its war against Ukraine and repaid Kyiv for the damage it caused  the G-7 said. The financing would likely take the form of a syndicated loan including multiple lenders  but the share for each participating country hasn’t been set. It will be disbursed through multiple channels to Ukraine’s military  budget  and reconstruction needs  the leaders said.The proceeds of around $300 billion in impounded Russian funds will back the loan. The bulk of these assets are blocked in the EU—roughly 190 billion euros ($206 billion) worth of various Russian Central Bank securities and cash are held with Belgian central securities depository Euroclear. Last year  they generated a $3.5 billion net profit. Only $5 billion is held in the United States.The much higher holdings of Russian assets in Europe and the much larger presence of European businesses in Russia make European companies more vulnerable to Moscow’s retaliation. “The relationship between Russia and the U.S. is equally hostile as between Russia and the EU  but going just by numbers  European companies are more exposed than U.S. ones ” Bruegel’s Steinbach said.It is hard to predict if any specific corporate sector could be more at risk. Some analysts said the decision may fall on companies whose expropriation would cause little disruption to the Russian economy.Western banks are in a particularly difficult position. Eurozone banks still involved with Russia  in particular  have come under growing pressure in recent weeks from the bloc’s supervisors  as well as U.S. authorities  over their ties to the country. The European Central Bank (ECB) has asked eurozone lenders to provide a clear road map to exit the Russian market.U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in May that European banks faced growing risks operating in Russia  adding that the United States was looking at strengthening its secondary sanctions on banks found to be aiding transactions for Russia’s war effort. But for eurozone banks  especially for those running a large retail business there  the obstacles are manifold.Last September  Italian bank Intesa Sanpaolo secured a presidential decree authorizing it to dispose of its Russian assets but still has to finalize its exit. The Russian Central Bank hasn’t given its green light  leaving the bank—which in the meantime has reduced both its cross-border and local business to residual levels—in a limbo  a person familiar with the matter said.Cutting the exposure to Russia may also prove to be particularly challenging in the case of pool loans to Russian clients  as the other lenders  often non-European  that are part of the pool need to agree  the person said.Italian rival UniCredit  which is the second-largest eurozone bank in Russia after Austria’s Raiffeisen  said at the beginning of July that it had reduced its Russia cross-border exposure by 91 percent and local exposure by 65 percent  with “further substantial reductions” planned. But it decided to challenge the terms set by the ECB to cut its exposure to Russia and seek a ruling from the EU’s General Court  as well as a freezing of the request in the meantime.A complex regulatory framework involving Western sanctions against Moscow and local Russian laws led it to seek “clarity and certainty” on its obligations  UniCredit said. The ECB declined to comment.“If the Russian state chooses to appropriate their assets  there is very little these companies could do to stop that happening ” said Marcus Fishburn from the risk consultancy S-RM. “That is the bed they have made for themselves by choosing to stay in the country  and they will have to lie in it.”,neutral,0.0,0.83,0.16,negative,0.0,0.29,0.71,True,English,"['Western Companies', 'Russia Sanctions', 'Swiss food giant Nestlé', 'French industrial gas producer', 'U.K. consumer group', 'Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center', 'British consumer group', 'Brussels-based think tank', 'protracted legal battle', 'Yogurt producer Danone', 'U.S. companies', 'Russian retaliatory policies', '15 percent exit tax', 'Many Western businesses', 'consumer goods', 'Many companies', 'retaliatory actions', 'Western companies', 'Western sanctions', 'European companies', '1,000 foreign companies', 'Russian jurisdiction', 'Russian business', 'Russian buyers', 'G-7 nations', 'future proceeds', '$50 billion loan', 'G-7 decision', 'bureaucratic obstacles', 'potential losses', 'significant amounts', 'Maria Zakharova', 'Foreign Affairs', 'economic countermeasures', 'hard place', 'higher chance', 'Kyiv School', 'Armin Steinbach', 'European Union', 'different situations', 'Air Liquide', 'local managers', 'regulatory approval', 'Foreign Policy', 'Financial Times', 'chief executive', 'Kris Licht', 'basic foods', 'exit process', 'local buyers', 'mandatory discount', 'unfriendly” countries', 'corporate exodus', 'Reuters analysis', 'special accounts', 'foreign clients', 'Nabi Abdullaev', 'London-based partner', 'prominent victims', 'steep discount', 'G-7 leve', 'Western funds', 'Russian operations', 'Russian assets', 'Alexandra Prokopenko', 'nonresident fellow', 'reduced operations', 'Control Risks', 'Foreign assets', 'company filings', '40 percent', '50 percent', 'months', 'discussions', 'mid-June', 'Ukraine', 'funding', '2022 invasion', 'plans', 'plenty', 'scope', 'country', 'property', 'spokesperson', 'Ministry', 'nature', 'arsenal', 'political', 'rock', 'options', 'background', 'losers', 'Berlin', 'data', 'Economics', 'Bruegel', 'February', 'hold', 'Others', 'minimum', 'rest', 'September', 'memorandum', 'understanding', 'sale', 'update', 'Reckitt', 'April', 'ownership', 'interview', 'Unilever', 'essential', 'profit', 'statements', 'strategy', 'market', 'seller', 'authorities', 'addition', 'write-downs', 'revenue', 'March', 'headquarters', 'dozens', 'money', 'consultancy', 'pain', 'response', 'announcements', 'beer-maker', 'Carlsberg', 'deal', 'Moscow', 'value', 'talks']",2024-07-12,2024-07-13,foreignpolicy.com

The notifications details can be found below and can be consulted on the website of BioSenic  under the heading “Major shareholders & transparency notices”.The transparency notification indicates that the shareholdings held by Véronique Pomi have crossed below the threshold of 5% as a result of the sale of shares of BioSenic.The notification received from Véronique Pomi dated 9 July 2024 contains the following information:Reason for the notification: Downward crossing of the lowest threshold Passive crossing of a thresholdNotification by: A person that notifies alonePerson subject to the notification requirement: Véronique PomiTransaction date: 9 July 2024Threshold that is crossed: 5%Denominator: 251 312 817About BioSenicBioSenic is a leading biotech company specializing in the development of clinical assets issued from its Medsenic’s arsenic trioxide (ATO) platform. Key target indications for the autoimmune platform include graft-versus-host-disease (GvHD)  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  and now systemic sclerosis (SSc).Following the merger in October 2022  BioSenic combined the strategic positionings and strengths of Medsenic and Bone Therapeutics. The merger specifically enables Medsenic/Biosenic to develop an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/oral ATO (OATO).BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About the main Medsenic/BioSenic technology platformThe ATO platform provides derived active products with immunomodulatory properties and fundamental effects on the activated cells of the immune system. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. cGvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT).Medsenic has been successful in a phase 2 trial with its intravenous formulation  Arscimed®  which has orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA. The company is heading towards an international phase 3 confirmatory study  with its new  IP-protected  OATO formulation. Another selected target is moderate-to-severe forms of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae  and the gastrointestinal tract). Systemic sclerosis is now full part of the clinical pipeline of Medsenic/BioSenic. This serious chronic disease badly affects skin  lungs  or vascularization  and has no current effective treatment. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive  giving good grounds to launch a phase 2 clinical protocol  using new immunomodulatory formulations of APIs recognized to be active on the immune system.The company is currently focusing its present R&D and clinical activities on a selective  accelerated development of its autoimmune platform.Note: The allogeneic cell therapy platform-originating from the previous listed company Bone Therapeutics company  may be of renewed interest by using isolated and purified differentiated bone marrow Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) as a starting material for further isolation of passive or active biological subcellular elements. Indeed  these cells may provide new subcellular vesicles potentially able to deliver a unique and proprietary approach to organ repair. BioSenic is now involved in determining new patentable approaches in this complex area of cell therapy.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAFrançois Rieger  PhD  CEOTel: +33 (0)671 73 31 59investorrelations@biosenic.comCertain statements  beliefs and opinions in this press release are forward-looking  which reflect the company or  as appropriate  the company directors’ current expectations and projections about future events.

However  it said that no final decision on time of place had yet been made. Contacted by Variety  Vivendi had no comment.The report saw Vivendi shares rise as much as 6.4% on Thursday  reaching their highest level since June 16  2022.Popular on VarietyCanal+’s listing in London would be a boon for the capital’s flagship market and comes as the local watchdog readies an overhaul of rules and a reduction of red tape aimed at attracting more listings.Variety reported last year that  over the previous decade  Vivendi’s annual turnover fell from €29 billion to €10 billion after it divested high profile assets including Universal Music Group.
