Close to half of current holdings have been in the portfolio since its inception.So they think long and hard before they buy – and make sure they find companies at the right price. That often means passing up on businesses that have great potential because they cost too much to fit with their strategy.‘We want double-digit returns ’ says Dillon. ‘The reason why we target that is because if we can compound our investors’ money at 10 per cent a year  then in seven years we’ve doubled it. That is a really high hurdle  which means we miss out on a lot of things.’However  sometimes it is only a matter of waiting for the share price to fall and then pouncing.Such an opportunity arose earlier this year when the animal health company Zoetis suffered a share price drop.The firm produces a drug that offers pain relief for dogs with osteoarthritis but the share price dropped after reports that some animals suffered side effects.A clinical study demonstrated it is safe with a low incidence of side effects  says Dillon  a dog lover for whom the appeal of the firm was obvious.‘Of course that’s sad if one affected is your dog  but most animals enjoy fantastic outcomes. We took the opportunity to buy it.’The fund’s long-term approach allows Dillon and Thomson to look through the short-term issues that distract some investors to seek out opportunities that may take some time to bear fruit.It is for this reason that  during the pandemic when international air travel came to a halt  they doubled down on their investment in the aircraft engine supplier Safran.‘We asked ourselves whether the circumstances that were impacting revenues would still be in place in five years’ time  and concluded they would not ’ says Dillon. ‘So we were able to buy when  in the short term  that felt like a surprising choice.’The fund has returned 12.8 per cent in five years  higher than the 11.7 per cent of its benchmark of global companies.Dillon and Thomson are obsessed by behavioural investing  managing their own biases to ensure they do not lead to poor decisions.They stay alert to the endowment effect  where people put more value on things they already have than on those they don’t.They also guard against loss aversion  where people are willing to take more risks to avoid making a loss than to make a gain.The pair sit with a coach every quarter to talk about their successes and failures and to analyse their processes. ‘This helps us to learn from our mistakes and to constantly improve ’ says Dillon.The fund’s ongoing charge is 0.88 per cent.,neutral,0.03,0.95,0.02,mixed,0.26,0.16,0.59,True,English,"['BROWN ADVISORY GLOBAL LEADERS', 'long game', ""customers' lives"", 'firms', 'Brown Advisory Global Leaders fund', 'German stock exchange', 'international air travel', 'aircraft engine supplier', 'parent company Alphabet', 'animal health company', 'manager Bertie Thomson', 'share price drop', 'five years’ time', 'global companies', 'seven years', 'right price', 'starting point', 'Economic theorists', 'important person', 'several sectors', 'top holdings', 'Deutsche Boerse', 'long term', 'current holdings', 'great potential', 'double-digit returns', 'high hurdle', 'pain relief', 'side effects', 'clinical study', 'low incidence', 'fantastic outcomes', 'long-term approach', 'short-term issues', 'short term', 'surprising choice', 'behavioural investing', 'poor decisions', 'endowment effect', 'ongoing charge', '10 per cent', '11.7 per cent', '0.88 per cent', '30 to 40 companies', 'promising businesses', 'investors’ money', 'dog lover', 'most animals', 'loss aversion', 'Mick Dillon', '12.8 per', 'Dillon.', 'manages', 'profits', 'value', 'shareholders', 'customers', 'lives', 'jobs', 'result', 'portfolio', 'Microsoft', 'Google', 'assets', 'management', 'half', 'inception', 'strategy', 'reason', 'lot', 'things', 'matter', 'opportunity', 'Zoetis', 'firm', 'drug', 'dogs', 'osteoarthritis', 'reports', 'appeal', 'opportunities', 'fruit', 'pandemic', 'halt', 'investment', 'Safran', 'circumstances', 'revenues', 'place', 'benchmark', 'biases', 'people', 'risks', 'gain', 'pair', 'coach', 'successes', 'failures', 'processes', 'mistakes']",2024-07-13,2024-07-14,thisismoney.co.uk
