This Aut0nom® certified warehouse completes and finalizes the ARGAN logistics park developed in St-Jean-sur-Veyle  which now totals over 100 000 square meters spread across three sites  two of which were developed in less than a year.From left to right: Mr. Christophe Greffet (President of the La Veyle Community of Municipalities)  Mr. Ronan Le Lan (Chairman of Argan’s Executive Board)  Mrs. Agnès Renoud-Lyat (Mayor of St-Jean-sur-Veyle)  Mrs. Karen Richard (Chairwoman of U Proximité France) et Mr. Dominique Schelcher (CEO of Coopérative U)Source: ARGANA tailor-made warehouse dedicated to food logisticsAfter a 12-month construction period  the teams of U PROXIMITE France (UPF) were able to take possession of their new logistics tool. Developed by ARGAN  it allows the branch of COOPERATIVE U (formerly SYSTEME U)  dedicated to operating local food stores  to deliver to all UPF stores in the northern half of the country.The multi-temperature warehouse consists of 20 000 sq.m for ambient storage  a 7 500 sq.m positive cold cell (+2/4 C°)  and a 2 200 sq.m negative cold cell (-25 C°). The logistics of all 22 000 food SKUs offered by the U EXPRESS and UTILE brands are managed on-site.An office block of 1 400 sq.m  on two levels  complements the complex  housing part of the150 employees working on the site.A few months after delivering a 14 500 sq.m Aut0nom® building to BACK EUROP  ARGAN concludes its logistics park project in St-Jean-sur-Veyle  now consisting of three sites offering over 100 000 sq.m of logistics space.ARGAN and U PROXIMITE FRANCE are mutually committed under a long-term 12-year lease. Demonstrating the companies' shared commitment to the highest standards of energy efficiency  the site is Aut0nom® labelled. A photovoltaic power plant developing a capacity of 1 300 kWp has been installed on the roof  complemented by storage batteries with a capacity of 500 kWh. The heat emitted by the cold production system is recovered to heat the warehouse. These installations significantly reduce the warehouse's energy consumption and carbon emissions. The residual emissions will be offset by a reforestation program in France  certified by the State's Low Carbon Label.Saint-Jean-sur-Veyle  a Prime location at the heart of France’s logistics corridorRonan Le Lan  Chairman of Argan’s Executive Board commented: “Less than 24 months have passed since the signing of the land agreement in St-Jean-sur-Veyle and the delivery of the final building in the logistics park. The commercialization was completed in record time! This demonstrates the appeal and relevance of this location for the development of logistics and transport activities. ARGAN continues its development by targeting overflow markets from large  often saturated urban areas. We thank all our partners  especially GSE  the A26 firm  and ARTHUR LOYD  as well as the La Veyle Community of Municipalities  which played a crucial role in the successful execution of the operation. We hope that these successes will lead to more for ARGAN in the Mâcon region”.2024 financial calendar (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)July 24: Half-year results 2024October 1: Net sales of 3rd quarter 20242025 financial calendar (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)January 3: Net sales of 4 th quarter 2024quarter 2024 January 16: Annual results 2024March 20: General Assembly 2025About ARGANARGAN is the only French real estate company specializing in the DEVELOPMENT & RENTAL OF PREMIUM WAREHOUSES listed on EURONEXT and is the leading player of its market.

43788,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.investing.com/news/press-releases/published-nhoa-group-2023-sustainability-report-93CH-3518425,Published NHOA Group 2023 Sustainability Report By Investing.com,Published NHOA Group 2023 Sustainability Report,"Sustainability led by People and for PeoplePARIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Regulatory News:NHOA Group (NHOA.PA  formerly Engie EPS) (Paris:NHOA) has published today its 2023 Sustainability Report.Sustainability has always been the main focus for NHOA Group and is deeply rooted in the nature of its business units  all dedicated to a single mission: enabling the global transition towards clean energy and sustainable mobility  shaping a better future for next generations so that they can live in harmony with our planet.NHOA Group accelerates the energy transition every day through:renewable energy storage systems  through NHOA Energy   with over 2GWh of projects across 5 continents; and  with over 2GWh of projects across 5 continents; and electric mobility with Free2move eSolutions  the joint venture with Stellantis (NYSE: )  and Atlante  one of the largest fast and ultra-fast charging networks in Europe for electric vehicles  with over 2 000 charging points online across Italy  France  Spain  and Portugal.Pursuing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)  the Sustainability Strategy is rooted in two pillars  People and Innovation while also recognizing that Innovation cannot exist without People.""In less than a decade  NHOA has turned from a Polytechnic spin-off generating a few hundred thousand euros to a group with over 270 million revenues  thanks to a team that today counts nearly 600 extraordinary people of over 40 nationalities. Our strong attention to people development  combined with 52% of the management team being women  makes it that NHOA is setting new growth and value standards.This 2023 Sustainability Report is a summary of this growth and proof of our commitment to sustainability and new generations. The dedication and passion of our People make NHOA a place where excellence thrives and harmony prevails. Through the NHOA Ã‰lite Program  we are nurturing tomorrow's leaders and promoting a culture rooted in Leadership  Commitment and Perseverance  as well as Harmony. Together  we are creating a better future where sustainability is led by People and for People "" commented Carlalberto Guglielminotti  Founder and CEO of NHOA Group.NHOA's Sustainability Strategy is built around enhancing people both inside and outside the company. In 2023  NHOA launched an ambitious employee policy  the People Strategy  aimed at all employees and extending its application beyond the organization through Diversity & Inclusion-Driven Education and Give Back to Communities initiatives developed or supported by NHOA.With the People Strategy rooted in the values of inclusion and diversity  physical and mental wellbeing of employees  NHOA has created one of the most advanced corporate welfare and wellbeing programs in Europe  the NHOA Ã‰lite Program  which forms an integral part of the employee policy and provides all employees with the tools to become Ã©lite leaders in their respective fields.Integrating passion and commitment within a broader focus on holistic wellbeing  the People Strategy aims to create an environment that fosters excellence and leadership  embracing integration and equal opportunities for all employees  allowing them to thrive in both their professional and personal lives.The NHOA Ã‰lite Program was inspired by a dual consideration. Firstly  80% of managerial responsibilities involve managing people and emotions  areas where training and education are virtually non-existent within traditional companies. Secondly  scientific research highlights the impact of digitalization over the past decade  particularly on Generation Z  with studies stating how digitalization has profoundly affected their emotional and psychological wellbeing. At the same time  Generation Z is entering the job market  placing a strong emphasis on corporate values  mission  and social commitment to local communities. These reflections led to the creation of the People Strategy and the NHOA Ã‰lite Program  recognizing the need for an employee policy focused on these critical aspects for the growth of a new generation of leaders.The NHOA Ã‰lite Program offers comprehensive training and support from world-class experts in physical and mental wellbeing  along with performance optimization training. The main goal is to promote a culture of excellence  harmony  and balance within every business unit. For this reason  the program provides all employees with access to training  coaching  and support developed in Ã©lite contexts  overseen by the Technical Director of the program  Alessandro Serra  former Head Coach of National World Cup Teams  and Katia Santus  former Alpine Skiing World Cup athlete and national instructor.The over 50 initiatives offered by the NHOA Ã‰lite Program  which saw participation from over 83% of employees  are structured on four pillars: diversity and inclusion  physical wellbeing  mental balance  and performance optimization.With more than 40 nationalities represented within the company  diversity and inclusion are the foundations of daily life at NHOA. For this reason  Daniele Cassioli  the most successful Paralympic athlete in history with 28 world titles  was chosen as Ambassador for diversity and inclusion and  through NHOA Ski Team  also two other exceptional athletes  Martina Vozza  the youngest athlete of the Italian Paralympic National Team  and her guide Ylenia Sabidussi.These are not sponsorship initiatives but true involvement of Paralympic athletes in the company's life to inspire NHOA employees towards the values of sustainability  passion  commitment  and perseverance  in line with the Group's culture and value framework.Corporate life is also filled with weekly opportunities where high-profile athletic trainers organize activities for employees' physical wellbeing directly in the office  from postural and genetic tests followed by dedicated athletic programming coordinated by Marco Tagliaferri  to in-office workouts with Stefania Bianchini  and nordic walking  close to company locations.On issues related to mental balance  NHOA Group provides its employees and their families with over 60 professionals from the Progetto Psiche  including psychologists  psychotherapists  psychiatrists  neuropsychiatrists  speech therapists  and nutritionists who offer continuous training services  mental wellbeing workshops  a psychological helpdesk  an anti-violence helpdesk  and individual therapy sessions focused on prevention and awareness.Regarding performance optimization  which is as crucial in a high-growth company as in personal life  NHOA Group has adopted the S.F.E.R.A. Model through which the entire management team of NHOA Group companies is trained  with the direct involvement of the model's creator  Giuseppe Vercelli  Professor of Psychology at the University of Turin  Head of the Psychological Area of Juventus F.C.  FISI  and the official psychologist of CONI for 5 Olympic Games  along with his entire team.The NHOA Ã‰lite Program also extends to initiatives developed or supported by NHOA that embrace communities and educate on diversity and inclusion. Among these is the NHOA Ski Team  a unique social project with the ambition to become a national educational model for all sports clubs that feel the responsibility to raise young people in a context of excellence  balance  and inclusion. The project  at the Italian level  started in Piedmont and Friuli-Venezia Giulia  and is expanding to Veneto with the NHOA Game Academy led by Giulia Gianesini  former World Cup athlete  national instructor  and Technical Director of the Veneto Committee.Commitment to people and communities is essential as it represents the foundation of a positive and sustainable corporate culture. For these reasons  NHOA Group employees have the opportunity to participate in activities with blind children and athletes from the Real Eyes Sport Association and to support the Theodora Foundation  bringing smiles to sick children in hospitals  during all corporate events.This commitment must extend beyond the workplace  as companies that actively support their communities  directly involving the management team and all employees  not only create a positive social impact but also inspire and transfer  both inside and outside the company  a value framework on which the concept of Ã©lite leadership is founded.This is just a summary of NHOA Group's Sustainability Strategy  which has led to extraordinary results such as the design of NHOA Energy systems that underwent a rigorous Life Cycle Assessment  conducted in accordance with the highest international PCR standards  receiving EPD (Environmental Product Declaration) certification. The assessment covered the entire lifecycle  from cradle to grave  analyzing the production  distribution  installation  use  maintenance  and end-of-life stages of the systems  which are based on proprietary power electronics and cutting-edge LFP batteries. Additionally  Atlante  in 2023 alone  avoided emissions of 7 000 tCO2  which are expected to exceed 120 000 by 2030: more than double the total Scope 3 emissions at the Group level.Comprehensive descriptions of all the social  environmental  governance  and integrated sustainability goals achieved are available in the 2023 Sustainability Report  which can be downloaded from the NHOA Group website in the dedicated section (www.nhoagroup.com/sustainability).NHOA GroupNHOA S.A.

French standards (€m) - unaudited H1 2023 H1 2024 Change (%) Mainland,"The Airwell Group (Euronext Growth  ALAIR)  creator of smart energy ecosystems  reports its half-year revenue for 2024.French standards(€m) - unaudited H1 2023 H1 2024 Change (%) Mainland France 15.3 16.0 +4.3% Overseas territories 2.6 1.4 -44.6% International 14.6 8.3 -43.1% TOTAL 32.5 25.7 -20.8%Activity in H1 2024Airwell has reported revenue of €25.7m in H1 2024  representing a year-on-year decrease of 20.8%.Throughout the first half  the Group operated in a generally less favourable environment  marked by a significant market slowdown on the back of several years of strong growth  particularly due to sluggish real estate activity. For instance  in France  the Air/Water heat pump market declined by approximately 46% (source: UNICLIMA).In this context  Airwell managed to outperform in mainland France  delivering growth of 4.3% to €16.0m in H1 2024  thanks in particular to the contribution of Airwell Industrie  amounting to €1.0m. The performance could have improved further without the postponement to the second half of some orders initially expected in the first half  particularly for Air/Water heat pumps and thermodynamic water heaters (slightly down by 4.2% in H1 2024). Conversely  Air/Air heat pumps posted growth of 49.9% over the period.Revenue in the French overseas departments and territories (DOM-TOM) came to €1.4m  down 44.6% year-on-year. As expected  sequential improvement was evident in Q2 2024 (-20.2%) versus Q1 (-68.4%)  primarily due to strong sales volumes in La Réunion. Meanwhile  Guadeloupe began its operations under favourable conditions following Airwell's direct takeover of sales activities.Moreover  the International region achieved revenue of €8.3m  declining by 43.1% versus H1 2023. Q2 2024 also showed improvement in this region from the previous quarter  though it continued to be affected by logistical disruptions (current lengthening of international shipping times)  which resulted in delivery delays into the next quarter.In terms of sectors  95% of H1 2024 sales were propelled by the residential market  and 5% by the commercial market.Strong growth confirmed in the second halfIn a global market expected to improve in H2  particularly with the resumed financial incentives and given the current order book  Airwell Group anticipates a strong rebound in sales in the second half. This trend will be driven by orders catching up with delays in France and abroad  and an expected ramp-up in the French overseas departments and territories (DOM-TOM).The Group will also benefit from the contribution of Airwell Industrie as part of its contract with Synerpod[1] and the launch of its new offerings. In this regard  Airwell Group will unveil an updated version of its service solution for smart  connected homes (""Ma Maison Hybride"")  in September  and is actively preparing to launch its energy renovation financing offer for the residential sector  as planned. Parallel to this  the Group is developing new offerings for Airwell Industrie to play a pivotal role in the major ""Made in France"" initiatives.Based on these developments and the strong rebound expected in the second half  the Group is confident in delivering another financial year of growth in 2024.Lastly  Airwell restates its ambitions for 2025 to generate revenue of more than €100m  with an EBITDA margin in excess of 5%.Next release: H1 2024 earnings on 17 September 2024  after market closeAbout AirwellFounded in 1947 in France  Airwell is France's leading designer of heat pumps in the field of climatic and thermal engineering.
