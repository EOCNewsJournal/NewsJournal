Last month  the EU decided to use some of the interest generated by the funds to provide military aid to Kiev.Bloomberg suggested that the G7 had abandoned plans to seize the funds outright after the “veiled threat” from Riyadh.”We have long warned that illegal attempts to rob the Russian Federation  to expropriate our holdings  will one way or another cause huge damage to the international financial system and will make many big and rich countries feel concerned about the fate of their holdings abroad ” Peskov said  as quoted by TASS news agency. “That’s what is happening now.”The Saudis specifically mentioned debt issued by the French treasury  Bloomberg reported  citing its sources. Riyadh’s holdings of euro and French bonds “probably aren’t big enough” to make a “major difference” if they were sold off  the outlet wrote. It noted  however  that European officials were still concerned because other countries might follow the kingdom’s lead.The bulk of Russia’s assets is held in a Brussels-based depository and clearing house  Euroclear  and generated roughly €4.4 billion in interest last year.In June  the EU Foreign Affairs Council announced that it would make windfall profits from immobilized Russian funds available to Ukraine. The first tranche of €1.4 billion is expected to be transferred this month  and will be used to purchase ammunition and aerial defense systems. Another €1 billion will be transferred by the end of the year.Russia has said any actions taken against its assets would amount to “theft ” stressing that seizing the funds or similar moves would violate international law and lead to retaliation. It has also warned that aiding Kiev is only prolonging the conflict.,negative,0.0,0.24,0.76,negative,0.0,0.23,0.77,True,English,"['frozen Russian assets', 'Rich countries', 'fate', 'Kremlin', 'EU Foreign Affairs Council', 'Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov', 'TASS news agency', 'aerial defense systems', 'international financial system', 'EU debt holdings', 'international law', 'Saudi Arabia', 'Western attempts', 'other countries', 'The US', 'sovereign wealth', 'central bank', 'military aid', 'illegal attempts', 'Russian Federation', 'huge damage', 'many big', 'rich countries', 'The Saudis', 'French treasury', 'French bonds', 'major difference', 'European officials', 'Brussels-based depository', 'clearing house', 'windfall profits', 'first tranche', 'similar moves', 'Russian assets', 'Russian funds', 'threat', 'G7', 'Moscow', 'point', 'concern', 'Tuesday', 'comments', 'wake', 'report', 'Bloomberg', 'Group', 'Seven', 'plans', 'members', 'part', 'sanctions', 'conflict', 'Ukraine', 'interest', 'Kiev', 'Riyadh', 'fate', 'sources', 'outlet', 'kingdom', 'lead', 'bulk', 'Euroclear', 'June', 'ammunition', 'end', 'year', 'actions', 'retaliation']",2024-07-16,2024-07-17,rt.com

In particular  the volume relating to purchases of existing real estate proved very healthy. This can be explained by the fall in interest rates compared with 2023  the slight rebound in property prices seen in 2024 and a gradually deterioRating supply of rental properties. The volume of lending for new builds remains low because construction costs are still at a very high level.

The Frankfurt Stock Exchange (Börse Frankfurt - FWB)  operated by Deutsche Börse AG  is one of the world's largest trading centers for securities and the largest of the eight stock exchanges in Germany.

We believe the investment community in Germany will appreciate our efforts aimed at putting carbon back into the ground - right where it belongs! We look forward to building interest  engagement  and shareholder value with this dynamic European audience.""Scientists have suggested that 950 million hectares (2.3 billion acres) of new forests could help limit the increase in global average temperature to 1.5-degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels by 2050.[1] This one-time solution would require reforesting an area the size of the United States and Canada combined (1 to 2 billion hectares) and with an anticipated removal rate of 5 tonnes of CO 2 per hectare  per year  it could take between one and two thousand years to accomplish.[2] Alternatively  BluSky is working to mass produce machines that will aim to remove 67.5 tonnes of CO 2 per day. Once operational  the Vulcan biomass pyrolysis technology is expected to convert 5 tonnes of organic waste into biochar and bioenergy every hour  with modular designs and engineering for increased scalability already well underway.""Once fully operational and connected with the development stage Medusa[3] carbon mineralization system and Kronos[4] direct air capture system  the Vulcan output is expected to provide much of the needed energy to power the estimated initial operating requirements which targets the removal of 40 000 tonnes of CO 2 per year "" notes CEO Hessert. ""BluSky Carbon was founded with the goal of removing gigatonnes (billions of tonnes) of CO 2 from the atmosphere every year. The clearest path to reaching that level of scale is having unrivaled capital efficiency when deploying CDR solutions. We believe our hybrid approach is one of the better pathways to achieve that goal.

The mortgage finance business models in the Real Estate & Mortgage Platforms segment were the main contributors to the Hypoport Group’s growth thanks to better market conditions and greater market share for the Europace  Finmas and Genopace platforms. In particular  the volume relating to purchases of existing real estate proved very healthy. This can be explained by the fall in interest rates compared with 2023  the slight rebound in property prices seen in 2024 and a gradually deteriorating supply of rental properties. The volume of lending for new builds remains low because construction costs are still at a very high level. This also applies to new loans taken out for energy efficiency improvements and to the refinancing of expiring loan agreements.

43801,Deutsche Boerse,Bing API,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/52-ownership-deutsche-b-rse-054937802.html,With 52% ownership  Deutsche Börse AG (ETR:DB1) boasts of strong institutional backing,Key Insights Institutions' substantial holdings in Deutsche Börse implies that they have significant influence over,Key InsightsInstitutions' substantial holdings in Deutsche Börse implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price39% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholdersUsing data from analyst forecasts alongside ownership research  one can better assess the future performance of a companyA look at the shareholders of Deutsche Börse AG (ETR:DB1) can tell us which group is most powerful. The group holding the most number of shares in the company  around 52% to be precise  is institutions. In other words  the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal  institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight  especially with individual investors. Therefore  a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.In the chart below  we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Deutsche Börse.Check out our latest analysis for Deutsche BörseWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Deutsche Börse?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see  institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Deutsche Börse. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else  they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time  you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Deutsche Börse's earnings history below. Of course  the future is what really matters.Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company  so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Deutsche Börse. Massachusetts Financial Services Company is currently the company's largest shareholder with 5.2% of shares outstanding. The second and third largest shareholders are The Vanguard Group  Inc. and Flossbach & Von Storch Vermoegensmanagement AG  with an equal amount of shares to their name at 4.1%.On studying our ownership data  we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register  implying that no single individual has a majority interest.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock  so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of Deutsche BörseThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries  but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However  it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members  especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However  on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our data cannot confirm that board members are holding shares personally. Given we are not picking up on insider ownership  we may have missing data. Therefore  it would be interesting to assess the CEO compensation and tenure  here.General Public OwnershipThe general public  who are usually individual investors  hold a 48% stake in Deutsche Börse. While this group can't necessarily call the shots  it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight  we need to consider other information  too.I like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past. You can access this interactive graph of past earnings  revenue and cash flow  for free.Ultimately the future is most important.

43809,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.hospitalitynet.org/news/4122909.html,Welcoming Guests With Disabilities and Ensuring Accessibility  Two Key Accor Priorities Driven Forward by the Paris 2024 Games,Long committed to promoting inclusive hospitality  Accor  Premium Partner of the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games  seizes this occasion to enhance its efforts: 380 Accor brand hotels are undergoing “Tourisme & Handicap” certification  new solutions are…,Long committed to promoting inclusive hospitality  Accor  Premium Partner of the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games  seizes this occasion to enhance its efforts: 380 Accor brand hotels are undergoing “Tourisme & Handicap” certification  new solutions are being introduced to promote augmented accessibility  and team members at Accor brand hotels are receiving training to extend a better welcome to persons with disabilities.Over the past few months  the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games have been a catalyst to improve the way in which we cater for travelers with disabilities. Employees and hotels have been working hard to make Paris 2024 a wonderful experience for everyone. This achievement will be one of the legacies of this historic event for Accor and we are determined  once the Games are over  to continue rolling out the best innovations worldwide to welcome every single guest. Sébastien Bazin  Chairman & CEO of AccorTake a look on Anne-Sophie Beraud  Accor’s SVP Social Care & Impact and Andrew Parsons  President of the International Paralympic Committee  discussing opportunities ahead in promoting the inclusion of persons with disabilities and the importance of Paris 2024 as a catalyst for change.380 Accor brand hotels have received or are in the process of receiving “Tourisme & Handicap” certificationThe French government’s “Tourisme & Handicap” certification  which has been operationally managed by Atout France since May 1  2024  recognizes the commitment of tourism establishments to ensuring and improving the accessibility of tourist destinations and providing optimum autonomy  for all. This initiative and the certification criteria meet all four types of disability – auditory  cognitive  physical and visual.As part of the Paris 2024 Games  over half of the Group's hotels in host locations have begun a certification process. In early July 2024  more than 380 Accor brand hotels had already received (80 hotels)  or were about to receive  certification  demonstrating the dedication of hotel teams  owners and partners to improving accessibility. Reflecting this commitment  on June 5  2024  the Group received Atout France’s Gold Award for accessible tourism.Accor brand “Tourisme & Handicap” certified hotels are registered on the “Accès Libre” online platform set up by the French government  which aims to list the accessibility of all venues open to the public in France and share this information as widely as possible. The Group intends to extend this initiative to all its hotels in France and carry this across to other regions of the world in order to share best practices internationally.Accelerated rollout of“Smart Room” features – the practical designer concept that is transforming accessibility standards in Accor hotelsLaunched by Accor in 2017  the “Smart Room” is an original room concept that elevates accessibility standards in the hotel industry and is rolled out as part of new openings and hotel refurbishments. Combining style and functionality  the Smart Room exceeds accessibility standards and offers an experience that ends the demarcation between PRM (Persons with Reduced Mobility) rooms and other room types. “Smart rooms” include an adaptable wardrobe (low or high position)  adjustable bed  curtains and washbasins  as well as a sliding door to the bathroom. Every detail has been designed to meet PRM standards  without any compromise to aesthetics or the sensory experience. All Group hotels have access to a catalog of features to improve the accessibility of its guestrooms. An example is the Pullman Paris Bercy hotel  which has just completed the refurbishment of its guestrooms – they now include open cupboards with a retractable wardrobe  and automatic door opening via a push button for guests in wheelchairs.Digital solutions for augmented accessibilityIn addition to refurbishing its hotels  the Group has upgraded its digital solutions to facilitate access for people with disabilities before  during and after their stay.For the Paris 2024 Paralympic Games  the Group will be distributing 1 000 remote controls to visually impaired athletes and travelers staying at the Paris 2024 Athletes’ Village or at Accor hotels. These remote controls can activate all standardized systems (voice activated terminals in hotels  in the Paris 2024 village  at pedestrian crossings  etc.) facilitating safe travel for blind and visually-impaired people.The Group has also stepped up the rollout of digital solutions to improve accessibility and rethink the customer experience for disabled travelers ahead of their stay. As such  new filters have been added to the Group’s reservation platform ALL.com to highlight available accessible rooms.The Group also provides hotels and their owners with a selection of innovative solutions  including:Training Heartists® who form the heart of the Paris 2024 welcome programIn addition to technology solutions and a tailored hospitality package  service in Group hotels has been overhauled to cater for all types of disability through awareness-raising and training. The teams are using new training modules developed with Accor team members  along with Hakim Arezki and Michaël Jeremiasz  athletes and members of the “ALL Champions Family”  a team of athletes that the Group is supporting during Paris 2024. These training courses will be extended to other countries after the Paris Games.Accor x Paris 2024 : Discover More About Our CommitmentAbout Accor  a world-leading hospitality groupAccor is a world leading hospitality group offering experiences across more than 110 countries in 5 600 properties  10 000 food & beverage venues  wellness facilities or flexible workspaces.

After adjusting for the scope effect of recent acquisitions (Globion in India and Sasaeah in Japan)  revenue growth reached +13.1% at constant exchange rates and scope. In a buoyant market context  our remarkable achievement reflects the strong organic growth momentum observed in all our regions  as well as  to a lesser extent  a favorable base effect (specifically the limitation of our dog and cat vaccine production capacity last year). In Europe (+11.8% at constant exchange rates and scope)  all our sub-zones achieved double-digit growth  mainly thanks to the contribution of the companion animal segment  and more particularly the vaccines  petfood/pet care and parasiticides ranges. Our U.S. subsidiary posted growth of +18.1% at constant exchange rates and scope  driven by the success of our specialty products for companion animals  particularly the dental range. Latin America ended the quarter with the Group's strongest growth (+20.0% at constant exchange rates and scope)  thanks to contributions from Mexico  Central America and Chile where parasiticides products from our aquaculture range are in strong demand; while Brazil returned to growth over the period. Growth in the India Middle East Africa region (IMEA  +12.1% at constant exchange rates and scope) was mainly driven by India  which benefited from a good dynamic for our bovine products  particularly the micronutrition range. With more modest growth rates  Asian countries are also progressing (+3.7% at constant exchange rates and scope)  notably China where the companion animal segment is growing strongly. Finally  after a sluggish first quarter  sales in the Pacific region returned to growth (+8.2% at constant exchange rates and scope) thanks to demand for livestock products and the launch of new products.Cumulative consolidated revenue at the end of JuneOver the first half  our revenue reached €703.1 million compared to €610.5 million in 2023  representing an overall change of +15.2%. Excluding currency effects  revenue rose significantly by +16.2%. The integration of recently acquired companies (Globion in India and Sasaeah in Japan) contributed +4.9 growth points. At constant exchange rates and scope  first-half organic growth reached +11.3%  favorably impacted by the concomitant increase in volumes and prices (price effect estimated at ~3.5 growth points) despite a slowdown in inflation. It should be noted that the first half of the year benefited from a favorable basis for comparison  due in particular to the increase in our production capacity for dog and cat vaccines since the beginning of this year.The Europe zone (+12.3% at constant exchange rates and scope) accounted for almost half of the Group's organic growth  benefiting from a strong rebound in the dog and cat vaccine range  as well as increased demand for our petfood/pet care ranges. As the beginning of 2023 was marked by distributors’ destocking effect  the performance of North America (+22.2% at constant exchange rates and scope) benefited from a favorable base effect together with sustained sales momentum on our specialty products for companion animals. Latin America (+10.5% at constant exchange rates and scope) benefited from remarkable performances in Chile  Mexico and Central America  which more than offset the slight downturn in Uruguay and Brazil. India continues to fuel our expansion in the IMEA region (+9.5% at constant exchange rates and scope)  recording a significant increase (~20% at real rate and actual scope) thanks to the expansion of our portfolio following the acquisition of Globion's poultry vaccines. China and South-East Asia countries were behind our growth in Asia (+8.8% at constant exchange rates and scope). Despite the rebound seen in the second quarter  the Pacific region ended the half-year slightly down (-0.8% at constant exchange rates and scope)  penalized by an unfavorable basis for comparison  as business at the start of 2023 benefited from a particularly favorable agricultural and climatic context (prices and herd stock increases).In terms of species  the companion animal segment posted strong growth of +15.1% at constant exchange rates and scope  driven by the good momentum of our dental  dermatology  petfood and specialty product ranges  as well as our dog and cat vaccine range following the increase in our production capacity. The farm animal segment posted growth of +7.0% at constant exchange rates and scope  mainly driven by the ruminant sector together with strong growth in the aquaculture segment.Outlook 2024We confirm our revised forecasts: in line with our press release of July 8  2024  at constant exchange rates and scope  we now anticipate revenue growth between 7% and 9%  and an adjusted Ebit3 ratio of around 16%. The contribution of recent external growth operations4 is expected at around +5.5 growth points on revenue  with a slightly accretive impact on Group profitability. At constant exchange rates and actual scope  revenue growth is therefore expected to be between 12.5% and 14.5%.3“current operating profit before amortization of assets resulting from acquisitions” to “revenue” ratio4acquisitions of Globion in India and Sasaeah in JapanConsolidated revenue by quarterCONSOLIDATED FIGURESNon-audited figuresin € million 2024 2023 Growth Growthat constant exchange rates2 Growthat constant exchange rates and scope1 First quarter revenue 345.7 314.8 +9.8% +10.8% +9.7% Second quarter revenue 357.4 295.7 +20.9% +21.8% +13.1% Revenue for first half year 703.1 610.5 +15.2% +16.2% +11.3%Cumulated consolidated revenue at the end of June by regionCONSOLIDATED FIGURESNon-audited figuresin € million 2024 2023 Growth Growthat constant exchange rates2 Growthat constant exchange rates and scope1 Europe 281.2 251.2 +12.0% +12.3% +12.3% North America 95.5 78.1 +22.2% +22.2% +22.2% Latin America 111.5 98.2 +13.6% +10.5% +10.5% Asia 58.5 38.2 +53.4% +66.3% +8.8% Pacific 62.5 64.8 -3.5% -0.8% -0.8% IMEA5 93.9 80.0 +17.3% +19.1% +9.5% Revenue for first half year 703.1 610.5 +15.2% +16.2% +11.3%1growth at constant exchange rates and scope corresponds to organic growth of sales  excluding exchange rate variations  by calculating the indicator for the financial year in question and the indicator for the previous financial year on the basis of identical exchange rates (the exchange rate used is the previous financial year)  and excluding material change in scope  by calculating the indicator for the financial year in question on the basis of the scope of consolidation for the previous financial year2this change is calculated on the actual scope of consolidation  including scope impacts arising from acquisitions (Globion and Sasaeah)  for which the indicator in question is calculated on the basis of the previous year's exchange rate5lndia  Middle East and AfricaFirst half 2024 key eventsApril 1 Acquisition of Sasaeah  a leading animal health player in Japan.June 21 Finalization of the acquisition of Globion  an Indian specialist in poultry vaccines.July 8 Announcement of the resignation of Sébastien Huron - CEO  and upward revision of the 2024 guidance.A lifelong commitment to animal healthAt Virbac  we provide innovative solutions to veterinarians  farmers and animal owners in more than 100 countries around the world.

We are impressed by the team’s incredible launch execution  bringing 2 700 new patients onto VYVGART IV treatment in the first quarter of 2024  which underscores the high unmet need that remains for gMG patients. The addition of a flexible 30-to-90second subcutaneous injection opens the door for new patients in China  while taking into account personal preference and convenience. We look forward to continuing our partnership and expanding our footprint in one of the world’s fastest growing markets to reach more people living with severe autoimmune diseases.”​​“We are pleased to receive NMPA approval for efgartigimod SC  marking an important milestone as we bring another first-in-class option to gMG patients in China ” said Rafael G. Amado  M.D.  President  Head of Global Research and Development at Zai Lab. “The addition of a new treatment option for gMG patients enhances flexibility for patients  potentially further simplifying the regimen and making therapy more accessible within the community. We appreciate the NMPA for their thorough assessment and recognition of the therapy’s differentiated profile and the large unmet medical need in China.”“There are approximately 170 000 people living with gMG in China1 ” said Prof. Xueqiang Hu  M.D.  Ph.D.  Chief Physician of Department of Neurology  the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University. “Compared to fixed infusion schedules  the availability of efgartigimod SC allows a more individualized and flexible treatment approach based on patient needs without sacrificing clinical benefit or safety. In the global Phase 3 ADAPT-SC study  efgartigimod SC demonstrated consistent benefit and safety compared to the intravenous product. This is a meaningful advancement for the patient community  and we are grateful to Zai Lab for supporting patients who have been devastated by this disease for so long.”The BLA approval is supported by positive results from the global Phase 3 ADAPT-SC study  a bridging study to the Phase 3 ADAPT study  which formed the basis for approval of intravenous VYVGART in adult gMG patients. In the ADAPT-SC study  the primary endpoint of noninferiority was met (p< 0.0001)  and efgartigimod SC demonstrated mean total IgG reduction of 66.4% from baseline at day 29  compared to 62.2% with efgartigimod IV. Additional key secondary endpoints were also met  which were consistent with efficacy measures from the ADAPT study identifying the correlation between total IgG reduction and clinical benefit in gMG.The safety profile for efgartigimod SC was also consistent with the ADAPT study. Efgartigimod SC was generally well-tolerated; the most frequent adverse event being injection site reactions (ISRs)  commonly observed with biologics administered subcutaneously. All ISRs were mild to moderate and resolved over time.Efgartigimod SC is also being evaluated for the potential treatment of additional autoimmune disorders. In May 2024  the NMPA accepted a supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) with priority review for efgartigimod SC in chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved efgartigimod SC in June 2024 for adults with CIDP.About VYVGART® and Efgartigimod SCVYVGART (efgartigimod alfa injection) is a human IgG1 antibody fragment that binds to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn)  resulting in the reduction of circulating IgG autoantibodies. It is the first approved FcRn blocker for the treatment of adults with generalized myasthenia gravis (gMG) who are anti-AChR antibody positive.Efgartigimod SC is a subcutaneous product including efgartigimod alfa injection  a human IgG1 antibody fragment  and recombinant human hyaluronidase PH20 (rHuPH20)  Halozyme’s ENHANZE® drug delivery technology to facilitate subcutaneous delivery of biologics. The product is to be administered subcutaneously as a single injection (1 000 mg fixed dose) over 30-to-90 seconds in cycles of once weekly injections for four weeks. Efgartigimod SC is approved in the United States (marketed as VYVGART® Hytrulo)  EU (marketed as VYVGART® SC) and Japan (marketed as VYVDURA®).Efgartigimod has the potential to address a multitude of severe autoimmune diseases where pathogenic IgGs are believed to be mediators of disease and is being evaluated in several autoimmune indications.Zai Lab has an exclusive license agreement with argenx to develop and commercialize efgartigimod in mainland China  Hong Kong  Macau  and Taiwan (collectively  Greater China).About Myasthenia Gravis in ChinaMyasthenia gravis (MG) is a chronic autoimmune disease  characterized by debilitating and potentially life-threatening muscle weakness. There are approximately 170 000 people in China living with gMG1  and of those patients  85% are estimated to have confirmed AChR antibodies; in this generalized form of the disease  skeletal muscles throughout the body may be affected  resulting in weakness and early fatigue. Difficulties with double vision  facial expression  speech  swallowing  and ambulation are frequent and difficult to manage for patients and treating physicians. In more life-threatening cases  gMG can affect the muscles responsible for breathing  which can be fatal. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitors  steroids  immunosuppressants  and IVIg are the mainstay of treatment in China. These drugs often achieve only partial restoration of strength.1 The growing burden of generalized myasthenia gravis: a population-based retrospective cohort study in Taiwan  2023.About argenxargenx is a global immunology company committed to improving the lives of people suffering from severe autoimmune diseases.

On top of these record bookings  which will generate more than €7 million in additional revenue for the coming year  it’s how we accomplished this performance that gives us signs of encouragement as we look to the quarters ahead. Above all  we must highlight our consistent results in two consecutive quarters with binding contract commitments averaging 45 months for our large accounts  despite current macroeconomic uncertainty. Our growth driver is now almost perfectly balanced between the United States and Europe  with each region accounting for 45% and 55% of bookings. Though France represents 31% of total bookings  its contribution must be relativized over time. Lastly  despite the fact that Q3 is traditionally the weakest period for bookings  assuming this trend continues into H2 2024  it would only further enhance the robustness of our economic model which – as a reminder – is 90%-based on recurring revenue.In revenue terms  Sidetrade turned in an excellent half-year performance  aligning with 2023 and posting growth of 19%. This double-digit figure is driven both by our expansion in the United States (+40%) and by a significant increase in our subscription revenue with multinationals generating $2.5 billion-plus revenue (+34%). With more than 60% of our revenue now achieved through international markets including 32% in North America  combined with 90% recurring revenue and an increasingly powerful growth driver  Sidetrade is showcasing its robust development strategy against an uncertain economic and geopolitical backdrop. The ongoing acquisition of SHS Viveon AG in Germany means that we are in pole position to cement our global leader status in the Order-to-Cash market and to execute our Fusion100 strategic plan  targeting $100 million in revenue by the end of 2026.”All-time performance for half-year bookings: ACV up 25%Sidetrade(€m) H1 2024 H1 2023 Change New SaaS subscriptions (New ARR) 3.95 3.30 +20% Services bookings 3.47 2.62 +32% New Annual Contract Value (ACV) 7.42 5.92 +25%2024 information is from consolidated  unaudited data.In H1 2024  Sidetrade set another record for bookings  adding €7.42 million in new Annual Contract Value (ACV) versus €5.92 million in H1 2023  representing a substantial increase of 25%. It should be noted that H1 2023  which saw growth of 21% versus H1 2022 (€4.81 million)  already turned in the Company’s best performance to date in ACV terms  representing a challenging base effect. On balance  between H1 2022 and H1 2024  Sidetrade reported an increase of more than 54% in its ability to win new bookings.This first-half performance is partly due to the Company’s success in North America since it represents new ACV of €3.34 million  accounting for 45% of total bookings. Sidetrade’s development model now shows a near-perfect balance between North America (45%) and Europe (55%). Within Europe  France accounted for 31% of total bookings  serving as a relative contributor to Sidetrade’s future growth.In H1 2024  the initial contract period for new customers (excluding renewals) rose to 45 months (vs. 44.8 months a year earlier)  considerably above SaaS industry peers who generally run contract periods between 24 and 36 months. This is a clear testament to new customers’ confidence in Sidetrade’s solutions despite prevailing economic and political uncertainties. Looking to the quarters and years ahead  new customers’ binding contract period serves to increase the Company revenue model’s predictability and resilience.New SaaS bookings (New ARR) totaled €3.95 million  up 20% on H1 2023 (€3.30 million)  reaching an unprecedented level for a first half in Sidetrade's history  even though Q2 2023 remains the best-performing single quarter to date in terms of bookings. Q1 and Q2 2024 recorded more regular and steadier new SaaS bookings compared to the same periods last year  posting €1.85 million (Q1 2024) and €2.10 million (Q2 2024) versus €0.89 million (Q1 2023) and €2.41 million (Q2 2023).Overall  in H1 2024  Total Contract Value (TCV) increased to €12.24 million versus €10.87 million a year earlier.Parallel to this  services bookings  with almost all invoiced within 12 months of their signing  totaled €3.47 million for the first half of 2024  up 32% on the same period the previous year (€2.62 million). This strong increase is still attributed to the multiplication of global projects  in line with the successful business strategy kick-started 24 months ago  targeting accounts generating $1 billion-plus revenue.In H1 2024  bookings by new customers (“New Business”) accounted for 64% of the total. Cross-selling for new entities within a Group and/or the sale of other main applications in Sidetrade’s Order-to-Cash suite  including CashApp  Credit Risk Expert and e-Invoicing  represented 19% of total new bookings. Lastly  the remaining 17% of bookings were driven by Upselling of additional modules to existing customers.For the third year running  Sidetrade was recognized as a Leader in the prestigious Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for Invoice-to-Cash applications. This distinction acknowledges the expertise of Sidetrade’s Integrated Invoice-to-Cash applications  reflecting the Company’s advancements in artificial intelligence (see press release of May 8  2024 ). Quarter after quarter  Sidetrade consolidates its leadership in the global Order-to-Cash market.This first-half 2024 performance reflects the upward trend in bookings observed during the 2023 fiscal year  further validating the relevance of the Company’s strategic decisions  namely: 1/ a business strategy kick-started 24 months ago  with a focus on companies generating $1 billion-plus revenue  2/ an increased recognition by multinationals of Sidetrade's technological edge in AI  particularly in the United States  and 3/ the development of a comprehensive Order-to-Cash software suite resulting from a strategy of continuous innovation.Strong revenue increase of 19%  with SaaS subscriptions up 18%Sidetrade(€m) H1 2024 H1 2023 Change Order-to-Cash SaaS subscriptions 20.5 17.4 +18% H1 revenue 24.8 20.9 +19%2024 information is from consolidated  unaudited data.In H1 2024  Sidetrade reported strong growth in revenue for Order-to-Cash SaaS subscriptions  up 18%.The Company’s revenue for the first half of 2024 totaled €24.8 million  also reporting an increase of 19%. On a Group-wide basis  this double-digit growth is attributable to:Robust revenue growth in the United States  up 40%Quarter after quarter  the United States is a growth driver for Sidetrade  posting revenues up 40% to €7.9 million in H1 2024. International markets account for 60% of the Company’s total revenue  with 32% coming from North America. Going forward  the United States will continue to be pivotal for Sidetrade's growth.Ever-increasing demand from multinational corporationsAnalysis of customer profiles is underpinned by growth of 34% in subscriptions with multinational corporations on Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) contracts in excess of €250 000. These subscriptions now account for 47% of Sidetrade's total subscriptions and are expected to remain an important growth driver in the quarters ahead.Consolidation of CreditPoint Software businessEffective July 1  2023  the consolidation of the CreditPoint Software business has positively contributed to Sidetrade's performance. In H1 2024  CreditPoint generated revenue of €0.8 million  with a 4% impact on quarterly growth.It should be noted that all multi-year Sidetrade contracts are routinely indexed to inflation (the Syntec for Southern Europe  the UK CPI for Northern Europe and the US CPI for the United States). This measure alters the total price of SaaS subscriptions each year by reference to changes in these price indices  without anticipating contract renewals.Double-digit growth in sales confirmed for 2024On the back of an outstanding first-half performance  the Group’s management is confident in Sidetrade’s ability to deliver double-digit growth in the 2024 fiscal year.Next financial announcementFirst Half Year Results for 2024: September 10  2024  after the stock market closes.Investor relationsChristelle Dhrif 00 33 6 10 46 72 00 cdhrif@sidetrade.comMedia relationsBecca Parlby 00 44 7824 5055 84 bparlby@sidetrade.comAbout Sidetrade ( www.sidetrade.com )Sidetrade (Euronext Growth: ALBFR.PA) provides a SaaS platform dedicated to securing and accelerating cash flow.

Renovation of 56 rental homes (197) was completed.A total of 257 rental apartments are under construction (679).Profit from operations before depreciation improved year on year due to increased operational efficiency and savings measures.The occupancy rate improved slightly as demand increased.Summary for 1 April to 30 June 2024 (1 April to 30 June 2023)The economic occupancy rate was 95.3% (95.0).Net sales totalled EUR 75.8 million (71.5).Net rental income was EUR 57.5 million (52.5).Profit before taxes was EUR 31.4 million (-69.1).The unrealised change in the fair value of investment properties included in the result was EUR 5.1 million (-75.1).Housing investments amounted to EUR 10.0 million (46.5).Earnings per share were EUR 0.30 (-1.05).A total of 0 rental apartments were completed (513). Renovation of 0 rental homes (125) was completed.A total of 257 rental apartments are under construction (679).President and CEO Antti Aarnio:- We improved our profit from operations before depreciation by increasing our operational efficiency and implementing savings measures. Profit from operations before depreciation was also affected positively by the higher occupancy rate.- Demand for rental housing particularly in Helsinki is growing slightly  which is why our occupancy rate has improved year on year.- Inflation is continuing to decline and was 1.9% in Finland in April. In the eurozone  inflation rose to 2.6% in May (YoY) from 2.4% in April and was slightly higher than forecasts. In its June meeting  the European Central Bank lowered the deposit facility rate by 0.25 percentage points and is likely to continue rate cuts this year.- The renting of our latest rental apartments  the SATO homes to be completed at Peijinkuja 6  Finnoo  Espoo  in the autumn  started in May. The neighbouring building  Peijinkuja 10  will be completed in December 2024 and is  for the time being  our last property under construction.- According to market research company Nepa  SATO is clearly the most recognised brand in its segment  that is  rental housing. According to the 2023 research summary  we were the first rental housing provider that came to mind for more than one in five respondents.- Following the change negotiations completed in June  SATO’s organisation has been adjusted to reflect the current operating environment  with our fixed costs decreasing by about one million euros. Most of the savings will be realised in 2025.- I would like to thank SATO staff members for their openness  expertise and persistence and for their contributions to the continuous development of our residents’ comfort and housing.Operating environmentDuring the period under review  the continued abundant supply of rental housing and the economic uncertainty still remained key factors affecting SATO’s operating environment. Uncertainty is increased by the slow rate of economic growth  the increase in the number of unemployed jobseekers  the high interest rate level  and geopolitical risks.Inflation continued its decline and was 1.9% in Finland and 2.4% in the euro area in April. In May  the inflation in the eurozone rose to 2.6%. The long decline enabled the European Central Bank to decide on a key interest rate cut in June  and the markets expect further rate cuts this year. Weak economic growth and the declining employment rate are keeping consumer confidence at a low level. Going forward  both the lower interest rate level and waning inflation will improve consumers’ purchasing power and the employment rate  and Finland is expected to see moderate economic growth.Newbuild construction of homes is still declining. According to Statistics Finland  the volume of building permits for newbuilding granted in January–March 2024 was 20% lower than a year earlier. The prolonged decline in the building permits granted and building projects started is reflected in the number of completed dwellings. The newbuild construction volume of previous years  which exceeds the long-term housing demand  is  however  maintaining an oversupply of rental homes in the growth centres  albeit in Helsinki a slight downturn in the number of vacant rental homes was seen in April. The continued high level of housing supply has maintained intense competition for good tenants.The urbanisation trend continues  and dense urban housing is becoming increasingly popular. There is demand for rental homes in growth centres close to good public transport connections and services. Among the major growth centres  the Helsinki Metropolitan Area (HMA)  Tampere and Turku continue to enjoy strong growth  while Statistics Finland forecasts a downturn in the nationwide population trend in 2031. The HMA is projected to grow by more than 200 000 new residents by 2040. Almost 80% of HMA residents already live in households with one to two members  and the number of small households continues to grow. The proportion of immigrants is projected to increase in the HMA from the current 17% to 25% by 2030. The ageing population is moving to growth centres providing access to services and expects more and more housing-related services.The demographic change coupled with the price development create a stable foundation for rental housing demand  especially in the HMA  Tampere and Turku. Migration to large growth centres has continued  and the HMA’s migration gain in 2023 was the highest in the 2000s: 23 500 persons. This is reflected in the demand for rental homes in growth centres.Urbanisation  the income development of wage and salary earners  pent-up housing demand of households and lower interest rates together with the decrease in new housing production will increase housing demand towards the end of the year. The housing allowance policy changes may  however  steer consumers towards looking for more affordable housing. Some of those looking for a home to buy may be considering a rental home as a housing option.Rental housing providers are still competing for good tenants  which results in rent increases remaining moderate. Going forward  higher maintenance and finance costs will be reflected in higher rent costs  while at the same time the supply of rental housing decreases.REVIEW PERIOD 1 JANUARY TO 30 JUNE 2024 (1 JANUARY TO 30 JUNE 2023)Net sales and profitIn January–June 2024  SATO Corporation’s consolidated net sales totalled EUR 150.5 million (142.4).Operating profit was EUR 87.0 million (-68.6).

The main risks of SATO’s business are risks related to the business environment and financial risks.SATO’s most significant risks relate to prolonged inflation and the resulting rise in interest rate level. The war in Ukraine has resulted in a surge in the prices of energy  food  materials and commodities and an elevated interest rate level. Higher living costs may have a negative effect on the purchasing power of consumers as well as on their capacity to perform their obligations. If the strong growth in the cost of financing and maintenance costs continues and the market situation does not provide an opportunity to transfer the higher costs into rents in full  this may have a negative impact on the fair value of investment assets and the company’s ability to perform its obligations or to finance its investments. This means new investments and major renovations may have to be postponed.The highest risks in apartment rental are to do with cyclical movements and changes in supply and demand. The market risk may push the supply of rental homes higher than their demand. This would result in idle rental housing stock and pressure for rents to level off or fall  especially as regards old housing stock.A decline in the housing market may have a negative effect on the market value of SATO’s housing stock. In line with its strategy  SATO has been focusing in its investments on growth centres and on renovating and repairing existing housing stock and  consequently  ensuring the rentability and value development of the apartments.Changes in regulation by the authorities and in legislation and related uncertainty may have a significant impact on the reliability of the investment environment and  consequently  on SATO’s business. SATO monitors and anticipates these changes and calls attention to what it considers to be negative impacts of regulation.The management of financial risks is steered by the Group’s treasury policy. Our risk management principles have been defined in the treasury policy adopted by SATO’s Board of Directors. Our most significant financial risks relate to liquidity  refinancing and interest rates. We manage our liquidity and refinancing risks by diversifying the financing sources and maturity of our loan portfolio  and by holding sufficient liquidity reserves in the form of committed credit facilities and other long-term financing commitments. The company has in place a EUR 2.0 billion Euro Medium Term Notes (EMTN) Programme  under which SATO has issued bonds in the total amount of EUR 350 million.The means for managing liquidity risk at SATO include cash assets  a bank account limit  EUR 600 million in committed credit facilities and a EUR 400 million commercial paper programme. We increase the amount of reserves as the funding requirements grow. Our objective is to keep the liquidity requirements of the next 12 months covered by committed agreements.Floating-rate loans represent an interest rate risk which we manage by balancing the share of fixed- and floating-rate loans either by fixed-rate debt arrangements or interest rate derivatives. In accordance with our treasury policy  our aim is for fixed-rate loans  including interest rate derivatives  to account for more than 60% of our debt portfolio. At the end of the review period  the fixed rate portion of the loan portfolio after hedging was 52.7% (62.9) excluding short-term loans.For a broader description of risks and risk management  see the Group’s website and Annual Report for 2023 at www.sato.fi/en.OutlookIn the operating environment  SATO’s business activities are mainly affected by consumer confidence  development of purchasing power  rent and price development for apartments  competitive situation and interest rate level.Weak economic growth and the declining employment rate are keeping consumer confidence at a low level. Going forward  both the lower interest rate level and waning inflation will improve consumers’ purchasing power and the employment rate  and Finland is expected to see moderate economic growth.Newbuild construction of homes is still declining. According to Statistics Finland  the volume of building permits for newbuilding granted in January–March 2024 was 20% lower than a year earlier. The prolonged decline in the building permits granted and building projects started is reflected in the number of completed dwellings. The newbuild construction volume of previous years  which exceeds the long-term housing demand  is  however  maintaining an oversupply of rental homes in the growth centres  albeit in Helsinki a slight downturn in the number of vacant rental homes was seen in April. The continued high level of housing supply has maintained intense competition for good tenants.The urbanisation trend continues  and dense urban housing is becoming increasingly popular. There is demand for rental homes in growth centres close to good public transport connections and services.The demographic change coupled with the price development create a stable foundation for rental housing demand  especially in the HMA  Tampere and Turku. Migration to large growth centres has continued  and the HMA’s migration gain in 2023 was the highest in the 2000s: 23 500 persons. This is reflected in the demand for rental homes in growth centres.Urbanisation  the income development of wage and salary earners  pent-up housing demand of households and lower interest rates together with the decrease in new housing production will increase housing demand towards the end of the year. The housing allowance policy changes may  however  steer consumers towards looking for more affordable housing. Some of those looking for a home to buy may be considering a rental home as a housing option.Rental housing providers are  however  still competing for good tenants  which results in rent revisions remaining moderate. Going forward  higher maintenance and finance costs will be reflected in higher rent costs  while at the same time the supply of rental housing decreases.In line with the decision made in October 2022  SATO will still refrain from launching any newbuild construction projects.In line with its majority shareholder’s operating model  SATO Corporation will not publish guidance on its 2024 earnings.

(NYSE: PFE) and Valneva SE (Nasdaq: VALN; Euronext Paris: VLA) today announced that the participants of the Phase 3 trial “Vaccine Against Lyme for Outdoor Recreationists” (VALOR) have completed the primary vaccination series (three doses) of Lyme disease vaccine candidate VLA15. Participants will be monitored for the occurrence of Lyme disease cases until the end of the Lyme disease season in 2025.1 “The completion of the primary series of our VALOR trial is a critical step toward our goal of providing a safe and effective vaccine against Lyme disease ” said Annaliesa Anderson  Ph.D.  Senior Vice President and Head of Vaccine Research and Development  Pfizer. “VLA15  the Lyme disease vaccine candidate we are co-developing with Valneva  is the one which has advanced the furthest along the clinical development timeline  with two Phase 3 trials in progress.”Juan Carlos Jaramillo  M.D.  Chief Medical Officer  Valneva  said  “We are pleased to see the progress of our Phase 3 VALOR trial. Lyme disease is the most prevalent vector-borne disease in the United States and Europe. It can result in debilitating complications and extensive healthcare treatments. Given the growing burden  high medical need  and lack of effectiveness with current interventions  there is an urgent need for novel approaches to help prevent Lyme disease.”The VALOR trial  for which Pfizer is the sponsor  is a multicenter  placebo-controlled  randomized  observer-blinded trial conducted at sites in areas where Lyme disease is highly endemic across the U.S.  Canada  and Europe. The aim of the trial is to evaluate the efficacy  safety  tolerability  immunogenicity  and lot consistency of VLA15  a 6-valent OspA-based Lyme disease vaccine candidate.1 Trial participants aged 5 years and older were randomized 1:1 into two trial groups and receive four doses of either VLA15 or a saline placebo – one dose each at months 0  2  5-9 and a booster one year after the third dose  shortly before the peak of the next Lyme disease season.1Subject to positive data  Pfizer plans to submit a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2026.VLA15 has shown a favorable safety profile across all dose and age groups in all clinical trials to date2 3. No safety concerns have been observed to date by an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) in any treatment group.2 3 A second Phase 3 trial (C4601012)  aiming to provide further evidence on the safety profile of VLA15 in the pediatric population between 5 and 17 years of age is ongoing; this trial completed enrollment in June 2023.Pfizer and Valneva entered into a collaboration agreement in April 2020 to co-develop VLA15  with updates to the terms within this agreement made in June 2022.4 5About VLA15There are currently no approved human vaccines for Lyme disease  and VLA15 is the Lyme disease vaccine candidate which has advanced the furthest along the clinical development timeline  with two Phase 3 trials in progress. This investigational multivalent protein subunit vaccine uses an established mechanism of action for a Lyme disease vaccine that targets the outer surface protein A (OspA) of Borrelia burgdorferi  the bacteria that cause Lyme disease. OspA is a surface protein expressed by the bacteria when present in a tick. Blocking OspA inhibits the bacterium’s ability to leave the tick and infect humans. The vaccine candidate covers the six most prevalent OspA serotypes expressed by the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato species in North America and Europe.About Lyme DiseaseLyme disease is a systemic infection caused by Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria transmitted to humans by the bite of infected Ixodes ticks.6 It is considered the most common vector-borne illness in the Northern Hemisphere.7 8 While the true incidence of Lyme disease is unknown  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has estimated that approximately 476 000 people in the U.S. are diagnosed and treated each year and 129 000 cases are reported annually in Europe.8 9 Early symptoms of Lyme disease (such as a gradually expanding erythematous rash called erythema migrans or other nonspecific symptoms like fatigue  fever  headache  mild stiff neck  muscle and joint paints) are often overlooked or misinterpreted. Left untreated  the disease can disseminate and cause more serious chronic complications affecting the skin  joints (arthritis)  the heart (carditis) or the nervous system.9 10 The medical need for vaccination against Lyme disease is steadily increasing as the geographic footprint of the disease widens.11AboutPfizer:BreakthroughsThatChangePatients’LivesAt Pfizer  we apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives.
