Brussels recently agreed to send some of the interest generated by the funds to Kiev  after months of deliberations and legal concerns.In its first resolution adopted since the EU parliamentary election last month  the bloc’s law-making body pledged to support Ukraine “for as long as it takes until victory.”“MEPs [Members of the European Parliament] welcome recent EU efforts to direct revenues coming from frozen Russian assets to support the Ukrainian war effort ” reads the press release published on the Parliament’s website on Wednesday.The document notes  however  that MEPs also want a “sound legal regime for the confiscation of Russian state-owned assets frozen by the EU.”The EU immobilized about €210 billion of sovereign wealth belonging to Russia’s central bank as part of sanctions imposed on Moscow over the conflict in Ukraine. The bulk of Russia’s assets are held in Euroclear  a privately owned Brussels-based depository and clearing house  and generated roughly €4.4 billion in interest last year. In June  the EU decided to use some of the interest to purchase ammunition and aerial defense systems for Kiev.Russia has said any actions taken against its assets would amount to “theft ” stressing that seizing the funds or similar moves would violate international law and lead to retaliation. It has also warned that aiding Kiev only prolongs the conflict.The EU Parliament has also called on the bloc to “maintain and extend” its sanctions policy on Russia and its ally Belarus  and tackle circumvention of the measures  including by third countries.,neutral,0.01,0.98,0.01,negative,0.0,0.28,0.72,True,English,"['Russian asset seizure plan', 'EU Parliament', 'bloc', 'Ukrainian war effort', 'aerial defense systems', 'sound legal regime', 'EU parliamentary election', 'recent EU efforts', 'Russian state-owned assets', 'The European Parliament', 'The EU Parliament', 'legal concerns', 'Russian assets', 'EU plan', 'military aid', 'first resolution', 'law-making body', 'press release', 'sovereign wealth', 'central bank', 'Brussels-based depository', 'clearing house', 'similar moves', 'international law', 'third countries', 'sovereign assets', 'June', 'revenue', 'Moscow', 'funds', 'weapons', 'Ukraine', 'profits', 'interest', 'Kiev', 'months', 'deliberations', 'bloc', 'victory', 'MEPs', 'Members', 'website', 'Wednesday', 'document', 'confiscation', 'part', 'sanctions', 'conflict', 'bulk', 'Euroclear', 'ammunition', 'actions', 'retaliation', 'policy', 'ally', 'Belarus', 'circumvention', 'measures']",2024-07-17,2024-07-18,rt.com
43833,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rt.com/business/601187-japan-billions-russian-assets-ukraine/,Japan to transfer billions of frozen Russian money to Ukraine – media,Japan will provide $3.3 billion in loans to Ukraine using interest from frozen Russian assets as part of the G7’s $50 billion aid package  Read Full Article at RT.com,Russian authorities consider the immobilization of the country’s sovereign funds to be illegalTokyo will shoulder 520 billion yen ($3.3 billion) in loans to Kiev funded by proceeds from Russian assets blocked as part of Western sanctions  the Kyodo news agency reported on Wednesday citing diplomatic sources.The figure represents some 6% of the massive loan agreed by the Group of Seven natons during their summit in Italy in June. G7 leaders reached an agreement on using interest from frozen Russian funds to finance a $50 billion loan to help Kiev buy weapons and rebuild damaged infrastructure.Kyodo cited diplomats as saying that Japanese authorities would hurry to finalize the necessary steps to implement their share of the financial support by the end of the current year.G7 finance ministers and central bank chiefs are reportedly poised to approve the loan package  in which the US and the EU each lend $20 billion and Japan  the UK and Canada lend a combined $10 billon  at a G7 meeting in Rio de Janeiro later this month.The West froze nearly $300 billion in assets belonging to the Central Bank of Russia shortly after the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in 2022. Most of the blocked funds are held in the EU  primarily in the Belgium-based depositary and clearing house Euroclear.In May  Brussels approved a plan to use windfall profits generated by the frozen assets to support Ukraine’s recovery and military defense. Under the agreement  90% of the proceeds are expected to go into an EU-run fund for Ukrainian military aid  with the other 10% is to be allocated for supporting Kiev in other ways.Earlier this month  Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov said that Kiev would use the money to strengthen its defense capabilities and support manufacturers  adding that the bulk of the money would go towards purchasing ammunition and air defense systems.Moscow has denounced the Western measures  emphasizing that military assistance to Kiev only prolongs the conflict. Russia has also condemned the freezing of its assets and warned against tapping them  which it sees as outright “theft.”Earlier this year  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that expropriation of Russian sovereign funds could create a dangerous precedent and become a “solid nail in the coffin” of the Western economic system. He stressed that Moscow would inevitably retaliate to such a move by launching legal proceedings against entities that tap its assets.,neutral,0.0,0.55,0.45,negative,0.0,0.3,0.69,True,English,"['Russian money', 'Japan', 'billions', 'Ukraine', 'media', 'Ukrainian Defense Minister Rustem Umerov', 'Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov', 'Ukrainian military aid', 'Rio de Janeiro', 'air defense systems', 'G7 finance ministers', 'Western economic system', 'Kyodo news agency', 'central bank chiefs', 'Russian sovereign funds', 'military defense', 'defense capabilities', 'Western sanctions', 'G7 leaders', 'G7 meeting', 'Western measures', 'military assistance', 'Russian authorities', 'Russian funds', '520 billion yen', 'diplomatic sources', 'massive loan', 'Seven natons', '$50 billion loan', 'damaged infrastructure', 'Japanese authorities', 'necessary steps', 'financial support', 'current year', 'loan package', 'The West', 'Belgium-based depositary', 'clearing house', 'windfall profits', 'EU-run fund', 'other ways', 'support manufacturers', 'dangerous precedent', 'solid nail', 'legal proceedings', 'Russian assets', 'Ukraine conflict', 'immobilization', 'country', 'Tokyo', 'loans', 'Kiev', 'proceeds', 'part', 'Wednesday', 'figure', 'Group', 'summit', 'Italy', 'June', 'agreement', 'interest', 'weapons', 'diplomats', 'share', 'end', 'Canada', '$10 billon', 'escalation', 'Euroclear', 'May', 'Brussels', 'plan', 'recovery', 'money', 'bulk', 'ammunition', 'Moscow', 'freezing', 'expropriation', 'coffin', 'move', 'entities']",2024-07-17,2024-07-18,rt.com

(NYSE: PFE) and Valneva SE (Nasdaq: VALN; Euronext Paris: VLA) today announced that the participants of the Phase 3 trial “Vaccine Against Lyme for Outdoor Recreationists” (VALOR) have comp…,Participants completed primary vaccination series (3 doses) with VLA15Primary vaccination series to be followed by a booster approximately one year after completionNew York  NY and Saint-Herblain (France)  July 17  2024 – Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and Valneva SE (Nasdaq: VALN; Euronext Paris: VLA) today announced that the participants of the Phase 3 trial “Vaccine Against Lyme for Outdoor Recreationists” (VALOR) have completed the primary vaccination series (three doses) of Lyme disease vaccine candidate VLA15. Participants will be monitored for the occurrence of Lyme disease cases until the end of the Lyme disease season in 2025.1 “The completion of the primary series of our VALOR trial is a critical step toward our goal of providing a safe and effective vaccine against Lyme disease ” said Annaliesa Anderson  Ph.D.  Senior Vice President and Head of Vaccine Research and Development  Pfizer. “VLA15  the Lyme disease vaccine candidate we are co-developing with Valneva  is the one which has advanced the furthest along the clinical development timeline  with two Phase 3 trials in progress.”Juan Carlos Jaramillo  M.D.  Chief Medical Officer  Valneva  said  “We are pleased to see the progress of our Phase 3 VALOR trial. Lyme disease is the most prevalent vector-borne disease in the United States and Europe. It can result in debilitating complications and extensive healthcare treatments. Given the growing burden  high medical need  and lack of effectiveness with current interventions  there is an urgent need for novel approaches to help prevent Lyme disease.”The VALOR trial  for which Pfizer is the sponsor  is a multicenter  placebo-controlled  randomized  observer-blinded trial conducted at sites in areas where Lyme disease is highly endemic across the U.S.  Canada  and Europe. The aim of the trial is to evaluate the efficacy  safety  tolerability  immunogenicity  and lot consistency of VLA15  a 6-valent OspA-based Lyme disease vaccine candidate.1 Trial participants aged 5 years and older were randomized 1:1 into two trial groups and receive four doses of either VLA15 or a saline placebo – one dose each at months 0  2  5-9 and a booster one year after the third dose  shortly before the peak of the next Lyme disease season.1Subject to positive data  Pfizer plans to submit a Biologics License Application (BLA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2026.VLA15 has shown a favorable safety profile across all dose and age groups in all clinical trials to date2 3. No safety concerns have been observed to date by an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) in any treatment group.2 3 A second Phase 3 trial (C4601012)  aiming to provide further evidence on the safety profile of VLA15 in the pediatric population between 5 and 17 years of age is ongoing; this trial completed enrollment in June 2023.Pfizer and Valneva entered into a collaboration agreement in April 2020 to co-develop VLA15  with updates to the terms within this agreement made in June 2022.4 5About VLA15There are currently no approved human vaccines for Lyme disease  and VLA15 is the Lyme disease vaccine candidate which has advanced the furthest along the clinical development timeline  with two Phase 3 trials in progress. This investigational multivalent protein subunit vaccine uses an established mechanism of action for a Lyme disease vaccine that targets the outer surface protein A (OspA) of Borrelia burgdorferi  the bacteria that cause Lyme disease. OspA is a surface protein expressed by the bacteria when present in a tick. Blocking OspA inhibits the bacterium’s ability to leave the tick and infect humans. The vaccine candidate covers the six most prevalent OspA serotypes expressed by the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato species in North America and Europe.About Lyme DiseaseLyme disease is a systemic infection caused by Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria transmitted to humans by the bite of infected Ixodes ticks.6 It is considered the most common vector-borne illness in the Northern Hemisphere.7 8 While the true incidence of Lyme disease is unknown  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has estimated that approximately 476 000 people in the U.S. are diagnosed and treated each year and 129 000 cases are reported annually in Europe.8 9 Early symptoms of Lyme disease (such as a gradually expanding erythematous rash called erythema migrans or other nonspecific symptoms like fatigue  fever  headache  mild stiff neck  muscle and joint paints) are often overlooked or misinterpreted. Left untreated  the disease can disseminate and cause more serious chronic complications affecting the skin  joints (arthritis)  the heart (carditis) or the nervous system.9 10 The medical need for vaccination against Lyme disease is steadily increasing as the geographic footprint of the disease widens.11About Pfizer: Breakthroughs That Change Patients’ LivesAt Pfizer  we apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives.

CARBIOS   (Euronext Growth Paris : ALCRB)  a pioneer in the development and industrialization of biological technologies to reinvent the life cycle of plastic and textiles  announces the publication of a new article entitled “An engineered enzyme embedded into PLA1 to make self-biodegradable plastic” in Nature  widely regarded as the most influential scientific journal  and co-authored with its longstanding collaborator  the Toulouse Biotechnology Institute (TBI)2. Enzyme-embedded PLA plastic can fully and rapidly degrade in home-compost or methanization conditions. The article describes the optimization process used to achieve an engineered enzyme able to withstand the 170°C3 temperature required to introduce it in molten state PLA during the plastic production process. The new enzyme-embedded material is proven to fully distintegrate and biodegrade at a much faster rate than the 26-week home-compost certification requirement and is also shown to help produce more biomethane  another source of waste recovery. Moreover  the material remains intact over long-term storage  the enzyme only being activated under composting or methanization conditions  ensuring compatibility with commercial PLA-based applications  for example  flexible packaging (such as sauce packets and wrappers) and short-life items (such as food containers  yogurt pots and coffee capsules).CARBIOS Active: CARBIOS’ commercial biodegradation solution is the direct result of the unique know-how developed by its enzymology expertsCARBIOS’ expertise in enzyme optimization contributed to the development of CARBIOS Active’s formula and industrial process. Integrated directly into the plastic material transformation process without any modification to production lines  the encapsulated enzyme CARBIOS Active enables the creation of a new generation of PLA products that are 100% compostable at ambient temperature  while ensuring quality compost  free from toxicity and microplastics. CARBIOS Active therefore opens up new biodegradation possibilites for PLA at ambient temperatures  including domestic composting conditions. A production line is already up and running at CARBIOS headquarters in Clermont-Ferrand  France  which can produce 2 500 tons/year of CARBIOS Active (required for the equivalent of 50 000 tons/year of enzyme-embedded PLA).Alain MARTY  Chief Scientific Officer  CARBIOS: ""A publication in Nature is an especially proud moment for all the contributing teams  notably recognition from peers in the scientific community. Developing an efficient enzyme that can withstand the 170°C needed to introduce it into PLA is an outstanding scientific feat! Our previous article published in Nature in 2020 was pivotal in bringing our PET biorecycling technology to the world stage. We are very excited by the enhanced visibility of CARBIOS’ unique biodegradation technology brought by this publication  as it offers a practical and scalable approach to various industrial PLA-based packaging applications.""Emmanuel Ladent  CEO  CARBIOS: “CARBIOS Active is the real-life application of CARBIOS’ expertise in enzyme optimization and polymer science. As CARBIOS expands its portfolio of enzymatic solutions beyond PET  enzyme-embedded PLA represents a major leap forward  addressing a critical gap in the market for compostable plastic. The recognition from the scientific community through this new publication in Nature comes in addition to recent certifications  such as the Food Contact Notification delivered by the FDA in North America  to attest CARBIOS Active’s performance and support its commercial deployment. Thanks to our long-term and exclusive partnership with Novonesis  we are transforming this scientific breakthrough into reality.”Isabelle André  Research Director at CNRS: ""I am immensely proud that the efforts and dedication of the researchers at TBI and our long-term partners at CARBIOS have been recognized by the journal Nature. This pioneering work on enzyme-embedded PLA to make self-biodegradable plastic is testament to our commitment to developing sustainable solutions with enzyme engineering at the core.”The article is co-authored by biotechnology researchers from CARBIOS and its academic partner Toulouse Biotechnology Institute (TBI)  as well as two eminent professors from University of Mons (Belgium) and Kasetsart University of Bangkok (Thailand). Once again  this collaboration demonstrates CARBIOS' ambition and ability to rally partners together in an efficient ecosystem to bring a collective solution to a major environmental challenge.To read the Nature article online  click here: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07709-1Publication has been scheduled in the 25 July 2024 issue of Nature.Authors:CARBIOS : Marie Guicherd  Marc Guéroult  Madiha Dalibey  Florent Grimaud  Sabine Gavalda  Marion Noël  Vincent Tournier  Alain MartyToulouse Biotechnology Institute : Maher Ben Khaled  Julian Nomme  Pablo Alvarez  Emma Kamionka  Marlène Vuillemin  Emilie Amillastre  Delphine Labourdette  Gianluca Cioci  Isabelle André  Sophie DuquesneUniversity of Mons Belgium: Philippe DuboisKasetstart University of Bangkok Thailand: Vichien Kitpreechavanich###About CARBIOS:CARBIOS is a biotech company developing and industrializing biological solutions to reinvent the life cycle of plastic and textiles.

This sudden drop caused consolidated sales to return to approximately the level of the first half of 2022. Business was also impacted by the lack of sales in China due to the geopolitical context. Nevertheless  Egide SA actively maintained its diversification strategy by expanding its customer portfolio. This strategy  while promising  requires long qualification phases  and will begin to pay off in 2025.Egide USA's first half of 2024 was characterized by a slowdown in sales to its main customer  due to overstocking and manufacturing problems  and by limited cash flow. Despite this difficult context  Egide USA maintained its diversification strategy by developing two new market segments: products for thermal batteries and for pyrotechnic and energetic devices for missiles. These new activities  although promising  encountered delays in their implementation  due to longer-than-expected customer qualification processes.Santier was impacted by disruptions to its supply chain due to limited cash and the failure of some of its suppliers to meet quality and delivery deadlines.Millions of eurosH1 2024 * H1 2023 Variation €m % sales €m % sales €m % sales Egide SA 7.04 46% 8.62 45% -1.58 -18% Egide USA 5.15 33% 6.35 33% -1.20 -19% Santier 3.24 21% 4.22 22% -0.98 -23% Group 15.43 100% 19.19 100% -3.76 -20%* unauditedFor the record  the average euro/dollar exchange rate in H1 2024 was 1.0823  compared with 1.0811 in H1 2023.Revenue per applicationThe decline in sales was mainly recorded in the thermal imaging and optronics market segments.Millions of eurosH1 2024 * H1 2023 Variation €m % sales €m % sales €m % sales Thermal Imaging 4.27 28% 7.48 39% -3.21 -43% Power 4.35 28% 3.67 19% 0.68 19% Optronics 1.81 12% 2.93 15% -1.12 -38% RF/MW 3.00 19% 2.84 15% 0.16 6% Others 2.00 13% 2.27 12% -0.27 -12% Group 15.43 100% 19.19 100% -3.76 -20%* UnauditedRevenue by RegionThe Group's share of sales rose in the rest of the world (from 20% to 31%) but decreased in Europe (from 29% to 22%) and North America (from 51% to 47%).This is mainly due to the decline in activity from a major customer in France and the development of new customers and sales in the Middle East.Millions of EurosH1 2024* H1 2023 Variation €m % sales €m % sales €m % sales North America 7.28 47% 9.72 51% -2.44 -25% Europe 3.40 22% 5.56 29% -2.16 -39% Asia & ROW 4.75 31% 3.91 20% 0.84 21% Group 15.43 100% 19.19 100% -3.76 -20%* Unaudited2. 2024 OUTLOOKThe Group continued to invest heavily in business development  allowing to diversify its customer portfolio and launch two new markets: thermal batteries and for pyrotechnic and energetic devices for missiles. However  new customers require relatively long qualification phases  which will only begin to be fruitful in the second half of 2024.Despite half-year sales expected to be above the first-half level in the second half  the Group will not be able to make up the gap left by the customer's major decline.Sales in 2024 will therefore be lower than in 2023 but will benefit from a more diversified customer base and an industrial infrastructure that is continuing to modernize.With its diversified customer base and modern industrial facilities  Egide has two major strengths to gain in competitiveness and absorb this temporary slowdown in order to return to growth.FINANCIAL CALENDARGENERAL SHAREHOLDER’S MEETING : July 25  20242024 H1 consolidated financial statements : October 22  2024CONTACTSEGIDE –Philippe Bringuier – Chief Executive Officer & Chief Financial Officer - +33 4 90 30 35 94 – pbringuier@fr.egide-group.comFIN’EXTENSO – Isabelle Aprile – Press Relations - +33 6 17 38 61 78 – i.aprile@finextenso.frAbout EGIDE - Keep up to date with all the Group's news online: www.egide-group.com and LinkedInEgide is a group with an international dimension  specialized in the manufacture of hermetic packages and heat dissipation solutions for sensitive electronic components.

The 200 megawatt (MW) project  which also includes a 40 MW battery energy storage system (BESS)  will generate enough energy to power the equivalent of 68 000 average California homes each year.Scarlet I has two executed power purchase agreements (PPAs)  which were announced previously  with Ava Community Energy (previously known as East Bay Community Energy) for 100 MW of solar and 30 MW of BESS and with San José Clean Energy (SJCE) for 100 MW of solar and 10 MW of BESS. This newest solar + storage facility builds upon EDPR NA’s existing 248 MW operational footprint in California.The Solar Energy Park supported the creation of more than 230 construction jobs and five permanent positions dedicated to ongoing operations and routine maintenance. Scarlet I will invest millions of dollars in small businesses and the local economy over the next several decades.“We’re excited for the commencement of Scarlet I as it plays a key role in Ava achieving our goal of providing 100% carbon-free electricity to all customers by 2030 ” added Howard Chang  CEO of Ava Community Energy. “Working with EDPR NA ensured that our investment in renewables - and making it easy for our customers to transition to clean and reliable energy while saving on monthly energy bills – is happening.”“This project will help us keep our commitment to providing clean energy for residents and businesses at competitive rates  while also offering community programs  local control  and more transparency and accessibility ” noted Lori Mitchell  Director  San José Clean Energy. “In sourcing and building clean and affordable renewables  we’re committed to advancing a more reliable and sustainable power grid for California.”Scarlet I will be aiding the region’s water efficiency goals  with the project estimated to save more than 254 million gallons of water each year that would have otherwise been consumed by conventional generation sources for equivalent energy capacity. In a nod towards advancing agrivoltaics - the dual use of land for solar energy production and agriculture - the project is actively exploring possibilities for sheep grazing on site following a recent trial run  utilizing locally sourced sheep.EDPR NA’s commitment to Fresno County has remained strong  with the company being a proud member of the Fresno Chamber of Commerce and Economic Development Corporation and engaging the local community through sponsorship of the 2023 State of the County event and the 2023 Fresno County Fair.“California remains a priority state for EDPR NA’s development efforts  and we are pleased to finalize this significant solar + storage project in The Golden State ” stated Sandhya Ganapathy  CEO of EDP Renewables North America. “Scarlet I will be a benchmark project as we look to develop additional hybrid multi-technology renewable projects across our portfolio and contribute further to grid resiliency.”EDPR NA is a key renewable energy leader in California.

It is reminded that McPhy and Atawey entered into exclusive negotiations in December 20231  following which McPhy received a binding offer from Atawey on February 19  20242 and signed a sale agreement for this business on April 19  2024.Jean-Baptiste Lucas  Chief Executive Office of McPhy  commented: “We are delighted to sell our refueling stations business to Atawey and to enable the McPhy's station teams to continue writing the future of hydrogen mobility. As pioneers in the French hydrogen industry  McPhy and Atawey share a common history and common values  and this proximity  further strengthened by this transaction  is rich with potential of future collaborations. The divestiture of this activity to one of the sector's leaders ensures the expansion and value of past investments. Following the recent inauguration of our Gigafactory  dedicated to a new generation of electrolyzers  McPhy is then refocusing its resources to accelerate its development and contribute to the structuring of the low-carbon hydrogen industry in Europe.”""We are thrilled of the acquisition of McPhy's stations business. This important milestone will enable us to support our growth and accelerate our international development. Thanks to our new industrial capacities  the mutual enrichment of our teams  and our unique expertise of over twenty-five years in the market  we are in a position to meet all needs and position ourselves as a key player in Europe's energy transition”  specified Jean-Michel Amaré  Chairman and co-founder of Atawey.In line with their exclusive negotiations entered into in December 2023  the two players have completed this transaction with an agreed sale price including:A fixed portion of €12 million  payable over 18 months  with an initial payment of €1 million on completion of the transaction. The balance of €11 million  with related interest  will be paid as and when Atawey achieves its financing plan for the combined business  or  failing that  in Atawey shares.An earn-out conditioned to future orders relating to the business subject matter of the transaction. This earn-out  payable in cash  is estimated  on the basis of assumptions known to date  ranging from €5.6 million to €12.5 million (the latter corresponding to the contractual ceiling amount).With this transaction  Atawey becomes the European leader in hydrogen refueling stations3 with the largest installed stations base  integrates employees already trained in the hydrogen business  and acquires an industrial tool with a capacity of over 80 stations per year. These necessary growth levers will enable Atawey to meet its current order book of nearly €25 million  its projections for very strong growth over the next years  and to achieve profitability in the next financial year. The company integrates McPhy's expertise and technologies. More than 40 employees from McPhy's teams will join Atawey to enable it to consolidate its know-how  cross-fertilize the experience of historical players in the hydrogen sector  and consolidate its expertise. This transaction comes at the right time for the Savoy-based company  which has enjoyed strong growth for several years and is expanding rapidly internationally.Concerning McPhy  as a reminder  the supply of stations represented 27% of its sales in 2023  with a portfolio of projects signed  commissioned and/or in progress to date  representing a total of around 40 stations. McPhy will also remain involved in the execution of current projects. With this transaction  McPhy is refocusing on its business as manufacturer of electrolyzers in Europe  while continuing to implement its financing plan. The proceeds from the disposal  together with the completion in June of a €30 million convertible bond issue and on July 11 of the real estate sale and lease back for €16 million  will provide the company with the resources it needs to finalize its industrial scale-up  which has just reached a key milestone with the inauguration of the Belfort Gigafactory.

The full report is attached to this release and will be available on Volta’s website shortly (www.voltafinance.com).PERFORMANCE and PORTFOLIO ACTIVITYDear investors In June  Volta Finance had another positive month with a net performance of +0.28%  bringing the year-to-date return at +9.8%. This performance is to be put in perspective with broader Credit markets  especially US High Yield which returned +2.62% year-to-date and European High Yield which returned +3.13%.However  June was quite volatile with market nervousness around the politic calendar given the French snap elections taking place as well as the looming UK general elections. The first round of the French elections calmed the markets as the far-right party did not gain a parliament majority  reducing de facto the probability of a Frexit-type of scenario. European equity markets rallied and the OAT-Bund spreads narrowed to their tightest levels on the month.In terms of market performance  both High Yield Credit indices CDX (US) and Xover (Europe) widened by 20bps to 25bps+  thus erasing the gains made in May. Loan markets were also softer  European loans lost c. half a point while its US counterpart lost 35 cents. Despite this volatility  the Primary CLO markets continued to show strong momentum with significant issuance in the US and Europe. Spreads tightened across the capital structure although non-Investment Grade tranches were trading slightly wider in Secondary on a month-to-date basis.Economically  weaker US data - US payroll growth slowing down  jobless rate up to 4.1% - raised hopes for additional Fed rate cuts in 2024. US government bonds yields declined while US equity markets reached record highs by the end of the month.Loan fundamentals in both Europe and the US remained strong with default rates sub 1.5% in both regions and less than 10% of both loan markets trading at a price below 90.00% of par. Meanwhile  loan refinancings continued to gain momentum while recoveries finally trended back up towards $60.00.Volta Finance’s investment portfolio was hit by the volatility   particularly in its US CLO Equity pocket  as lower loan valuations drove the prices of some amortizing CLO Equities down. All the other investment pockets were positive though  with CLO debts generating a steady stream of income. In terms of activity  in addition to funding of capital calls on the CLO warehouses  Volta Finance was a net buyer of BB and single-B risk purchasing respectively EUR 1.5mm and EUR 7.5mm of bonds (note that EUR 2.9mm of single-B risk paid par back). Objective was to reduce the overall cash balance of the fund and deploy into the CLO Primary debt tranches. The cashflow generation over the last 6 months remained strong at €28.3m equivalent of interests and coupons  representing c.21% of the month’s NAV on an annualized basis.Volta’s underlying sub asset classes monthly performances** were as follow: +1.0% for Bank Balance Sheet transactions  -0.45% for CLO Equity tranches  +1.35% for CLO Debt tranches and +0.1% for Cash Corporate Credit & ABS***  cash representing c.4% of NAV.As of end of June 2024  Volta’s NAV was €263.9m  i.e. €7.21 per share.*It should be noted that approximately 0.48% of Volta’s GAV comprises investments for which the relevant NAVs as at the month-end date are normally available only after Volta’s NAV has already been published. Volta’s policy is to publish its NAV on as timely a basis as possible to provide shareholders with Volta’s appropriately up-to-date NAV information. Consequently  such investments are valued using the most recently available NAV for each fund or quoted price for such subordinated notes. The most recently available fund NAV or quoted price was 0.25% as at 30 April 2024  0.23% as at 31 March 2024.** “performances” of asset classes are calculated as the Dietz-performance of the assets in each bucket  taking into account the Mark-to-Market of the assets at period ends  payments received from the assets over the period  and ignoring changes in cross-currency rates. Nevertheless  some residual currency effects could impact the aggregate value of the portfolio when aggregating each bucket.*** The cash Corporate Credit and ABS bucket is currently made of 3 legacy assets representing 0.8% of GAV.CONTACTSFor the Investment ManagerAXA Investment Managers ParisFrançois Touatifrancois.touati@axa-im.com+33 (0) 1 44 45 80 22Olivier PonsOlivier.pons@axa-im.com+33 (0) 1 44 45 87 30Company Secretary and AdministratorBNP Paribas S.A  Guernsey Branchguernsey.bp2s.volta.cosec@bnpparibas.com+44 (0) 1481 750 853Corporate BrokerCavendish Securities plcAndrew WorneDaniel Balabanoff+44 (0) 20 7397 8900*****ABOUT VOLTA FINANCE LIMITEDVolta Finance Limited is incorporated in Guernsey under The Companies (Guernsey) Law  2008 (as amended) and listed on Euronext Amsterdam and the London Stock Exchange's Main Market for listed securities.

Higher ore grades in H2 are expected to support stronger production and shipments are also expected to rise.Demand for all of our products remains robust and ilmenite prices in H1 were above our expectations  bolstered by increasing global pigment production.Kenmare ended the period with $58.5 million of cash  having paid $34.4 million in dividends and repaid all debt. The Company is well capitalised to fund the upgrade and transition of Wet Concentrator Plant A and to continue making shareholder returns.”Q2 2024 overviewLost Time Injury Frequency Rate (“LTIFR”) of 0.09 per 200 000 hours worked for the 12 months to 30 June 2024 (30 June 2023: 0.18)Kenmare is on track to achieve 2024 guidance across all stated metrics  with higher forecast grades driving increased production in H2Heavy Mineral Concentrate (“HMC”) production of 342 600 tonnes in Q2 2024  a 7% increase year-on-year (“YoY”)  due to an 8% increase in excavated ore volumes and higher heavy mineral recoveries  offsetting the 5% lower ore gradeIlmenite production of 238 600 tonnes in Q2 2024  up 8% YoY  due to a 6% increase in HMC processed and greater ilmenite content in the HMCPrimary zircon production of 13 000 tonnes  up 12% YoY  due to increased HMC processed and benefitting from drawdown of intermediate stocks and higher recoveriesTotal shipments of finished products of 234 700 tonnes  down 18% YoY  due primarily to poor weather conditions and additional operational maintenance  limiting shipping timeAs previously announced  Kenmare’s Board approved the final part of the Definitive Feasibility Study (“DFS”) in Q2 2024 for the upgrade and transition of Wet Concentrator Plant (“WCP”) A to the large Nataka ore zoneEncouraging market conditions continued in Q2 2024  with demand particularly robust for Kenmare’s ilmenite  and the Company has a strong order book for Q3At the end of H1 2024  net cash increased by $36.4 million to $57.1 million (31 December 2023: $20.7 million)As previously announced  Managing Director Michael Carvill will step down from his executive role and Board position on 14 August 2024 – the process to find his successor is approaching its conclusion and Kenmare will provide an update ahead of the Interim ResultsOperations updateProduction from the Moma Mine in Q2 2024 and H1 2024 was as follows:Q2 2024 Q2 2023 Q1 2024 H1 2024 H1 2023 tonnes % variance % variance tonnes % variance Excavated ore1 10 386 000 8% 13% 19 601 000 7% Grade1 3.84% -5% -8% 3.97% -5% Production HMC production 342 600 7% 8% 659 000 4% HMC processed 343 200 6% 11% 651 100 2% Ilmenite 238 600 8% 16% 441 100 4% Primary zircon 13 000 12% 56% 21 300 -7% Rutile 2 500 32% 65% 4 000 12% Concentrates2 11 700 13% 22% 21 400 4% Shipments 234 700 -18% -3% 477 600 -14%1. Excavated ore tonnage and grade prior to any floor losses.2. Concentrates include secondary zircon and mineral sands concentrate.As reported on 3 June 2024  Kenmare was deeply saddened by a fatality at the Moma Mine on 1 June 2024. An excavator operator employed by one of Kenmare’s contractors was involved in a fatal incident during the night shift. He was part of a team of contractor employees establishing a new dry mining area for the WCP A operations. Investigations have found that his death was related to activities outside of the ordinary course of operations and Kenmare is co-operating fully with the authorities.Kenmare’s rolling 12-month LTIFR to 30 June 2024 was 0.09 per 200 000 hours worked (Q2 2023: 0.18). One Lost Time Injury (“LTI”) was recorded during Q2 2024  not including the fatality as it was non-work related. Prior to this  the Moma team had achieved almost five million hours worked without an LTI  which is equivalent to eight months’ work.HMC production was 342 600 tonnes in Q2 2024  a 7% increase compared to Q2 2023 (318 900 tonnes). This was the product of an 8% increase in excavated ore volumes to 10 386 000 tonnes (Q2 2023: 9 606 000 tonnes) and higher heavy minerals recovery  offsetting the 5% decrease in ore grades to 3.84% Total Heavy Minerals (“THM”) (Q2 2023: 4.03% THM)  in line with expectations. Stronger heavy minerals recoveries are due to improvements at all three mining plants during the past year  including the addition of clean water to spiral separation at WCP A and the return to better mining conditions at WCP C.Production of finished products increased by 8% in Q2 2024 compared to Q2 2023  due primarily to a 6% increase in HMC processed. Ilmenite production was 238 600 tonnes  up 8% compared to Q2 2023 (221 300 tonnes)  benefitting from greater ilmenite content in the HMC. Primary zircon production was up 12% to 13 000 tonnes (Q2 2023: 11 600 tonnes) and rutile production was up 32% (Q2 2023: 1 900)  both supported by the drawdown of intermediate stocks and higher recoveries. Concentrates production was 11 700 tonnes  up 13% (Q2 2023: 10 400 tonnes)  also due to the drawdown of intermediate stocks.At the end of H1  Kenmare is on track to achieve its 2024 guidance on all stated metrics. The Company continues to expect production to increase in H2  supported by higher forecast ore grades.Total shipments in Q2 2024 were 234 700 tonnes  down 18% on Q2 2023 (285 100 tonnes)  due primarily to poor weather conditions and operational issues at Kenmare’s shipping facilities  limiting shipping time. Additional maintenance was required on the product transfer conveyor system during the quarter  and the system is now fully equipped to accommodate increased loadout rates in H2 2024. Shipments comprised 216 200 tonnes of ilmenite  8 200 tonnes of primary zircon  and 10 400 tonnes of concentrates. No rutile was shipped during the quarter. Shipments in Q1 2024 were 242 900 tonnes  as reported  and this included 600 tonnes of primary zircon as a result of a draft survey adjustment from a shipment in Q4 2023.Closing stock of HMC at the end of Q2 2024 was 24 600 tonnes  compared to 25 300 tonnes at the end of Q1 2024. Closing stock of finished products at the end of Q2 2024 was 273 000 tonnes  compared to 241 800 tonnes at the end of Q1 2024  reflecting production exceeding shipments during the quarter. Due to stronger production expected in H2 2024 and the current high levels of finished product stock  Kenmare expects stock levels to remain higher than usual during H2  before normalising during H1 2025.Capital projects updateAs announced on 4 July 2024  Kenmare’s Board has approved the final part of the DFS  relating to infrastructure  for the WCP A upgrade and transition to Nataka. Nataka is the largest ore zone in Kenmare’s portfolio and WCP A’s transition to this area secures production from Moma for decades to come.The total capital costs for the project remain in line with previous estimates  totalling $341 million. Ongoing detailed engineering and scheduling work has deferred $38 million of expected capital expenditure from 2024 into subsequent years  in line with the evolving mine plan.Works are advancing well for the upgrade  with the fabrication of the two new dredges and the upfront desliming circuit progressing  and the detailed design of the Tailings Storage Facility (“TSF”) on track for completion in Q3 2024. Construction of the TSF is expected to begin in Q4 2024.Work continues on both the DFS for the WCP B upgrade  which is expected to increase WCP B’s capacity by over 40%  and the Pre-Feasibility Study for the Congolone ore zone  which is a potential future growth opportunity for the Company. Kenmare expects to provide an update on both studies with the Company’s Interim Results  which will be announced on 14 August 2024.Corporate updateAs announced on 15 March 2024  Managing Director Michael Carvill will step down from his executive role and the Board at the Interim Results on 14 August 2024.The Board’s Nomination Committee has been working with an executive search firm to choose Michael’s successor  with internal and external candidates being considered. This process is approaching its conclusion and Kenmare will provide an update ahead of the Interim Results.Market updateKenmare experienced robust demand for all of its products in Q2 2024  particularly for ilmenite. Spot prices for ilmenite remained relatively stable throughout H1  however Kenmare’s average received price decreased slightly in Q2 compared to Q1 2024  due to some shipments rolling over from Q4 2023  when prices were stronger. Despite this  prices in H1 were above the Company’s expectations.Chinese pigment producers continued to produce at record levels during the quarter. Demand for Kenmare’s ilmenite was also bolstered by an uptick in operating rates among pigment producers in Europe and the United States to meet stronger underlying demand  as well as some restocking of titanium feedstocks. Speculation surrounding potential duties on Chinese pigment entering the European Union further supported demand and prices for European pigment.Global supply of titanium feedstocks remains sufficient to meet demand  with new supply from Chinese producers in African countries shipping concentrates to China for processing. However  this was partially offset by the suspension of operations in Sierra Leone and continued Mineral Resource depletion in Kenya. In the medium to long term  Kenmare believes that supply constraints will lead to global demand exceeding supply  supporting the fundamentals for all of the Company’s products.The zircon market remains relatively stable. Demand for zircon sand improved in Europe in Q2 2024  particularly from the ceramics industry. In China  the market softened following the improvement in late Q1 2024. However  Kenmare continues to experience robust demand for its concentrates in China due to the quality of the contained products.Kenmare has a strong order book for Q3 2024 as the Company’s customers restock their titanium feedstock inventories  following Kenmare’s disrupted shipping performance in Q2. Zircon shipments delayed from Q2 will also be shipped in Q3 2024  with consequent positive impact on H2 product mix and revenues.Finance updateOn 17 May 2024  Kenmare paid its 2023 final dividend of USc38.54 per share. This was the balancing payment of a 2023 full year dividend of USc56.04 per share  representing a dividend payout ratio of 38% of profit after tax (2022: 25%).Following the 2023 final dividend distribution of $34.4 million and principal debt repayments relating to the previous term loan facility of $47.1 million during H1 2024  cash and cash equivalents were $58.5 million at 30 June 2024 (31 December 2023: $71.0 million). Kenmare had no debt at the end of H1 2024 (31 December 2023: $50.3 million) and lease liabilities were $1.3 million (31 December 2023: $1.5 million). Accordingly  at 30 June 2024  Kenmare’s net cash had increased by $36.4 million to $57.1 million  compared to $20.7 million at 31 December 2023.For further information  please contact:Kenmare Resources plcJeremy Dibb / Katharine Sutton / Michael StarkeInvestor Relationsir@kenmareresources.comTel: +353 1 671 0411Mob: + 353 87 943 0367 / + 353 87 663 0875Murray (PR advisor)Paul O’Kanepokane@murraygroup.ieTel: +353 1 498 0300Mob: +353 86 609 0221About Kenmare ResourcesKenmare Resources plc is one of the world's largest producers of mineral sands products.

Paris  July 18 th   2024 – JCDecaux SE (Euronext Paris: DEC)  the number one,"(MENAFN- GlobeNewsWire - Nasdaq)JCDecaux's Group carbon reduction trajectory approved by the SBTiParis  July 18 th   2024 – JCDecaux SE (Euronext Paris: DEC)  the number one outdoor advertising company worldwide  is proud to announce that its carbon reduction trajectory has been approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). Known as the“Corporate Net Zero norm”  this climate action organisation supports companies worldwide in their reduction of greenhouse (GHG) emissions and their decarbonisation via a methodology consistent with the IPCC's recommendations. This validation  the most ambitious designation available through the SBTi process  reaffirms JCDecaux's commitment to actively participate in the fight against climate change by adopting eco-responsible practices and promoting sustainable innovation in its business practices.In June 2023  JCDecaux unveiled its new Climate Strategy  including targets to continue reducing its carbon footprint across its entire value chain. Based on three principles – Measure  Reduce and Contribute beyond the Group's value chain  the strategy aims for Net Zero Carbon by 2050 (scopes 1  2 and 3)*. To achieve this  JCDecaux defined a roadmap based on the Science-Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) that is backed up by scientific data. In late 2022  the Group signed a pledge to achieve these SBTi goals  and committed to submitting a low-carbon strategy with associated targets. This commitment was fulfilled in 2023. In June 2024  SBTi reviewed and approved JCDecaux's carbon reduction targets.The SBTi's Target Validation Team has classified JCDecaux's scope 1 and 2 near-term target ambition and has determined that it is in line with a 1.5°C trajectory. The Target Validation Team has also evaluated the Group's scope 1  2  and 3 long-term target ambition  and determined that it is aligned with the SBTi's 1.5°C mitigation pathways for reaching Net Zero by 2050 or sooner. Detailed targets as follows:Overall Net-Zero Target:JCDecaux SE commits to reach net-zero GHG emissions across the value chain by 2050.Near-Term Targets:JCDecaux SE commits to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 72.8% by 2030 from a 2019 base year1.JCDecaux SE also commits to continue active annual sourcing of 100% renewable electricity through to 2030.JCDecaux SE further commits to reduce absolute scope 3 GHG emissions from purchased goods and services  capital goods  fuel and energy related activities  business travel and employee commuting by 46.2% within the same timeframe.Long-Term Targets:JCDecaux SE commits to reduce absolute scope 1  2 and 3 GHG emissions by 90% by 2050 from a 2019 base year2. JCDecaux SE also commits to continue active annual sourcing of 100% renewable electricity through to 2050.JCDecaux's reduction trajectory is based on internal levers as well as external factors. As scope 3 accounts for more than 90% of its carbon footprint (market based)  reaching the target will be a collective journey requiring the collaboration of all its stakeholders. Since JCDecaux's furniture footprint accounts for 42% of its scope 3 emissions  it will need to cooperate with its suppliers to offer the market even more efficient low-carbon solutions without compromising on quality. To deliver this  JCDecaux will need to focus upon even more responsible public/ private procurement based on compelling and assessed environmental and social criteria as well as partnerships with landlords.Since its very beginning in 1964  JCDecaux has placed sustainability and efficiency at the heart of its business model. The Group created a Sustainable Development and Quality Department in 2007  set out an ambitious Sustainable Development Strategy in 2014  which was updated in 2022  and unveiled its ambitious Climate Strategy in 2023. In France  JCDecaux is contributing to the collective effort set by the public authorities  in particular by the voluntary adoption of a Climate Contract and by respecting its commitment to reducing its energy consumption by 10% in 2024 compared to 2019. JCDecaux designs  installs  and maintains light infrastructure (bus shelters  street furniture  self-cleaning public toilets  self-service bicycles  etc.) in public spaces and travel hubs thanks to the financing provided by the advertising for brands and companies displayed on that infrastructure. JCDecaux street furniture provide innovative and free services for millions of people around the world  as well as for local authorities and transport companies  based on resource-efficient management. This business model is virtuous in three ways: economically  ecologically  and socially.Jean-Charles Decaux  Chairman of the Executive Board and Co-Chief Executive Officer of JCDecaux  said: ""One year on from unveiling and starting to deploy our ambitious Climate Strategy geared towards the goal of“Net Zero Carbon”  we are very proud to achieve the validation of the SBTi after a multi-step process. Reducing our environmental footprint is one of JCDecaux's long-standing commitments. Our virtuous business model resonates with the Green Taxonomy  as nearly 50% of our 2023 revenues are aligned with this European regulation. As the number one worldwide in our business sector  we are determined to play an active role in the collective response to the challenges of climate change and to make outdoor advertising a driver of the ecological transition. JCDecaux will continue to work with all its stakeholders and to support those involved in public and private procurement to ensure that it becomes a powerful and effective driver of sustainable development  based upon quality as well as ambitious environmental and social criteria. It is through systemic actions and by engaging our entire value chain that we will contribute to Net Zero Carbon.""1 The target boundary includes land-related emissions and removals from bioenergy feedstocks.2 The target boundary includes land-related emissions and removals from bioenergy feedstocks.*Scope 1: Direct emissionsResulting from the manufacturing of products or the combustion of fuel for company vehicles (natural gas  oil  etc.)​Scope 2: Indirect emissionsAssociated with energy consumption that does not directly pollute (electricity  etc.)​Scope 3: Other indirect emissionsLinked to the rest of the company's activities (procurement  transport  end-of-life cycle  employee travel  etc.)​**Market-basedMethod of calculating CO2 emissions linked to electricity consumption  based on emissions factors associated with the supplier from which the company buys its electricity.

It is part of the ZEPIZURE® manufacturing program  which includes several batches from its commercial site  aimed at confirming  among other parameters  the shelf-life of ZEPIZURE®. These new advances are in line with previous long-term stability data.Manufacturing batches are critical parts of the dossier that will be submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to support ZEPIZURE®’s application for EUA. Combined with our upcoming U.S. bioequivalence study  they will also form the bedrock of our future New Drug Application filings from 2025 onward.Completion of this registration batch now paves the way for gathering new data  which will further demonstrate the quality of the products manufactured with the new equipment and ensure their satisfactory regulatory standing for widespread commercial use  starting with its delivery to the U.S. Government for national preparedness. Crossject is targeting its next milestones with the FDA regarding EUA of ZEPIZURE® for status epilepticus seizures in Q1 2025.“We are very pleased with the progress in setting-up a new CDMO partner  increasing fill-and-finish capabilities for ZENEO®. The successful production of this registration batch  as well as the earlier batches  are a testament to the hard work and dedication of both teams over the last 18 months. Beyond ZEPIZURE®  these achievements in our manufacturing process  regulatory standing and industrial scale-up truly have strategic value as a prelude to a broad deployment of our ZENEO® technology in epilepsy and in our other targeted market opportunities ” said Patrick Alexandre  CEO of Crossject.About CrossjectCrossject SA (Euronext: ALCJ; www.crossject.com ) is an emerging specialty pharmaceuticals company developing medicines for emergency situations harnessing its award-winning needle-free auto-injector ZENEO® platform.
