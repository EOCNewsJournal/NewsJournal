Verkkokauppa.com’s business is partly seasonal  and the company’s revenue and operating profit depend largely on the sales in the last quarter.CEO PANU PORKKA’S REVIEWThe operating environment remained challenging in the second quarter. Consumer confidence was low  and consumers postponed their purchasing decisions for discretionary products such as home electronics. Due to subdued demand  market development was also driven by very price-driven campaigning.Verkkokauppa.com's second-quarter revenue was EUR 105.5 million (112.8) and declined by 6 percent year-on-year. Sales development was weak; seasonal sales started slowly and were weaker than expected. Despite low demand  the company’s strategic growth drivers – online sales and own-brand sales  fared better than average.Low sales volumes  on the one hand  and intense price competition and campaign-oriented seasonal sales  on the other  weakened the company's results. In the low-demand market  we made the pricing decisions necessary to ensure seasonal products and inventory turnover. The gross margin for the quarter was 16.4 percent (16.7%). In addition  cost inflation eroded the positive impact of the efficiency measures taken  and the company's comparable operating result (EBIT) was EUR -1.7 million (EUR 1.0 million) and -1.6 percent of revenue (0.8%).We continued determinedly to execute our strategy and strengthen our market position to accelerate the online transition. In June  we reached a significant milestone as we extended one-hour deliveries to be available in the areas of our all stores  for more than 1.7 million customers. The share of fast deliveries continues to grow  and already more than a quarter of all online orders are delivered within an hour.In a challenging operating environment  we focus also on short-term measures to improve operational efficiency and adjust costs to the prevailing demand situation. At the same time  we are promoting the progress of strategic growth projects to grow our current business and strengthen our position as a forerunner in e-commerce. The recovery of the economy and the market has been slower than expected  and we have updated our financial guidance for 2024.FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENTREVENUE AND PROFITABILITY4–6/ 4–6/ Change1–6/ 1–6/ Change 1–12/ EUR million 2024 2023 2024 2023 2023 Revenue 105.5 112.8 -6.5 % 213.5 234.8 -9.1 % 502.9 Operating profit -2.0 0.8 -2.8 MEUR -2.4 0.9 -3.3 MEUR 4.7 Operating margin  % of revenue -1.9% 0.7% -2.6 pp -1.1% 0.4% -1.5 pp 0.9% Items affecting comparability 0.3 0.1 0.1 MEUR 1.2 1.5 -0.3 MEUR 1.4 Comparable operating profit -1.7 1.0 -2.7 MEUR -1.2 2.3 -3.5 MEUR 6.1 Comparable operating margin  % of revenue -1.6% 0.8% -2.5 pp -0.6% 1.0% -1.6 pp 1.2%Sales distributionSales  EUR million​ 4–6/2024 4–6/2023 Change  % 1–6 2024 1–6 2023 Change  % 1–12/2023 Customer segments Consumers 70.1 75.3 -7 % 140.9 154.3 -9 % 344.1 B2B (inc. wholesale)​ 32.2 33.9 -5 % 66.1 74.1 -11 % 146.7 Sales channels Online​ 67.4 69.9 -4% 136.6 145.7 -6% 316.8 Offline​ 34.9 39.4 -11% 70.4 82.7 -15% 173.9 Product categories Core categories* 89.4 93.2 -4% 183.9 198.3 -7% 428.6 Other product categories​ 12.9 16.1 -20% 23.2 30.2 -23% 62.1 Own brands​** 8.3 7.4 12% 14.3 13.0 10% 28.5 Website visits  million​ 16.6 16.9 -2% 34.1 36.4 -7% 79.8*Core categories include five main categories: IT  Entertainment  mobile devices  SDA  and MDA.** Own brands are included in Core and other product categories accordingly.APRIL–JUNE 2024Revenue totaled EUR 105.5 million (112.8) and declined by 6% year-on-year.

It will amount to EUR 1.55 billion from the proceeds of the frozen assets of the Russian Federation.ADVERTISIMENTThis is evidenced by the Euroclear report. ""In July 2024  Euroclear will make the first payment of €1.55 billion to the European Fund for Ukraine "" the report says.At the same time  it is noted that the total amount of Euroclear's income from frozen funds after taxes amounted to 1.7 billion euros. ""The remaining part of the profit (more than 1.55 billion euros - Ed.) is set aside as an important buffer to protect against current and future risks "" Euroclear said.It is noted that in this way Euroclear ""fulfills its important obligations to realize windfall income"" from the frozen assets of the Russian Federation. The depository notes that it continues to ""carefully comply"" with sanctions against Russian assets.In total  after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine  Western countries froze about $300 billion of Russian assets. These funds cannot be used directly for the benefit of Ukraine  as no decision has been made to confiscate them completely. However  Ukraine will receive income from these assets through a special EU fund.ADVERTISIMENTIn addition  Ukraine will receive a $50 billion loan from the G7 countries  which will be repaid from the profits from Russia's seized assets in the EU  the US  and partner countries. The amount of Russia's frozen funds will not change after that.The $50 billion loan will be divided among several countries. Thus  the largest contribution will be made by the US and the EU - $20 billion each.As reported by OBOZ.UA  the European Union has preliminarily approved the provision of EUR 4.22 billion in financial support to Ukraine under the Ukraine Facility program.

The funds have so far earned about €3.4 billion since they were immobilized  although profits generated before Feb. 15 will be retained by the clearing house as a buffer to handle current and future risks  such as litigation.The EU and the Group of Seven agreed last month to frontload the profits that will be made by the blocked funds over time with the aim of providing Ukraine with about $50 billion dollars in loans this year.G-7 nations and the EU aim to give out loans to Ukraine that will be repaid using the profits generated by the roughly $280 billion of blocked funds  most of which are held in Europe. Allies are currently working through the mechanics of how each will implement the plan.That arrangement  which would structure loans roughly based on the size of each participant’s economy  would replace the current EU scheme.Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek©2024 Bloomberg L.P.,neutral,0.0,0.99,0.01,negative,0.0,0.45,0.54,True,English,"['Russia Assets Profits', 'Euroclear', '€1.6 Billion', 'Kyiv', 'Russian Central Bank assets', 'The European Union', '2024 Bloomberg L.P.', 'Belgium-based clearing house', 'current EU scheme', 'first tranche', 'first payment', 'windfall tax', 'first transfer', 'financial results', 'first half', '€173 billion worth', 'future risks', '50 billion dollars', 'G-7 nations', 'Bloomberg Businessweek', 'profits', 'Ukraine', 'military', 'Euroclear', 'statement', 'Friday', 'implementation', 'legislation', 'bloc', 'bulk', 'funds', 'weapons', 'country', 'defense', 'aid', 'year', 'June', 'Feb.', 'buffer', 'litigation', 'Group', 'Seven', 'time', 'aim', 'loans', 'Allies', 'mechanics', 'plan', 'arrangement', 'size', 'participant', 'economy']",2024-07-19,2024-07-19,yahoo.com

As a result of the Reorganization Plan  and in line with what has been previously communicated  all of the Company's existing common shares and listed commercial hybrid bonds will be redeemed and cancelled in connection with SAS' emergence from its restructuring proceedings. Against this background  the Company has today applied for the delisting of its existing common shares from Nasdaq Stockholm  Nasdaq Copenhagen and Oslo Børs (the ""Exchanges"") and for the delisting of the Company's listed commercial hybrid bonds from Nasdaq Stockholm  conditional upon the decision to approve the Reorganization Plan entering into legal force.The Reorganization Plan includes resolutions to change the Company's capital structure through (i) the issuance of new unlisted shares to Castlelake  L.P.  on behalf of certain funds or affiliates  Air France-KLM S.A.  and Lind Invest ApS  together with the Danish State (collectively  the ""Investors"")  as well as certain general unsecured creditors that will receive new shares as recovery on account of their claims (entailing a total share capital increase corresponding to up to USD 550 million)[1]  (ii) the redemption and cancellation of all of the Company's existing common shares  without consideration to the shareholders (entailing a reduction of the share capital equal to the entire current registered share capital of approximately SEK 8.6 billion)  and (iii) a bonus issue without the issuance of shares (entailing a share capital increase of SEK 4.5 billion). In addition to the aforementioned changes to the Company's share capital  the Investors will also invest a total of USD 725 million in exchange for new secured convertible debt.The last day of trading of the Company's existing common shares and commercial hybrid bonds on the Exchanges and Nasdaq Stockholm  respectively  is expected to occur two trading days following the date on which the decision to approve the Reorganization Plan enters into legal force. Furthermore  when such decision has entered into legal force  it will no longer be possible to carry out conversions of the common shares between the securities depositary systems in Denmark  Norway and Sweden.The registration of the changes to the Company's capital structure with the Swedish Companies Registration Office (Sw. Bolagsverket)  and consequently the cancellation of the existing common shares from the shareholders' registers maintained by Euroclear Sweden  Euronext Securities Copenhagen and Euroclear Securities Oslo  as well as the redemption and cancellation of the commercial hybrid bonds  will be effected following emergence from the restructuring proceedings.The recovery to general unsecured creditors will be distributed in cash and/or new unlisted shares in the Company  as well as through contingent value notes (""CVNs"") that may  under certain conditions  entitle such general unsecured creditors to an additional cash distribution in the future. As to the Company's listed commercial hybrid bonds  holders of such commercial hybrid bonds as of Friday  July 26  2024 will be entitled to receive a distribution under the Reorganization Plan. In order to receive CVNs in connection with SAS' emergence from its restructuring proceedings  general unsecured creditors entitled to such CVNs must complete and submit a registration form by the emergence date. The registration form and further instructions  including information related to the holding period trust (for general unsecured creditors that have not submitted the registration form by the relevant deadline or are otherwise not eligible to receive CVNs)  are available on the Company's website  www.sasgroup.net/transformation.Application for company reorganization in Sweden was specifically contemplated by the plan of reorganization approved as part of SAS' chapter 11 process in the U.S. (the ""Chapter 11 Plan"")  and a successful completion of the company reorganization proceeding is a condition precedent for the Chapter 11 Plan to become effective. Provided that all other conditions precedent for the effectiveness of the transaction (including approvals from various regulatory authorities) are satisfied and the Stockholm District Court's decision to approve the Reorganization Plan enters into legal force upon expiry of the initial three-week appeal period  SAS currently expects to emerge from its restructuring proceedings during August 2024  but this timetable may change.Information regarding SAS' U.S. chapter 11 cases and SAS AB's company reorganization in SwedenAdditional information regarding SAS' voluntary chapter 11 cases in the U.S. and SAS AB's company reorganization in Sweden is available on SAS' dedicated restructuring website  https://sasgroup.net/transformation.

Known as the “Corporate Net Zero norm”  this climate action organisation supports companies worldwide in their reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and their decarbonisation via a methodology consistent with the IPCC’s recommendations. This validation  the most ambitious designation available through the SBTi process  reaffirms JCDecaux’s commitment to actively participate in the fight against climate change by adopting eco-responsible practices and promoting sustainable innovation in its business practices.In June 2023  JCDecaux unveiled its new Climate Strategy  including targets to continue reducing its carbon footprint across its entire value chain. Based on three principles – Measure  Reduce and Contribute beyond the Group's value chain  the strategy aims for Net Zero Carbon by 2050 (scopes 1  2 and 3)*. To achieve this  JCDecaux defined a roadmap based on the Science-Based Targets Initiative (SBTi) that is backed up by scientific data. In late 2022  the Group signed a pledge to achieve these SBTi goals  and committed to submitting a low-carbon strategy with associated targets. This commitment was fulfilled in 2023. In June 2024  SBTi reviewed and approved JCDecaux’s carbon reduction targets.The SBTi’s Target Validation Team has classified JCDecaux’s scope 1 and 2 near-term target ambition and has determined that it is in line with a 1.5°C trajectory. The Target Validation Team has also evaluated the Group's scope 1  2  and 3 long-term target ambition  and determined that it is aligned with the SBTi's 1.5°C mitigation pathways for reaching Net Zero by 2050 or sooner. Detailed targets as follows:Overall Net-Zero Target: JCDecaux SE commits to reach net-zero GHG emissions across the value chain by 2050.Near-Term Targets: JCDecaux SE commits to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 72.8% by 2030 from a 2019 base year 1 . JCDecaux SE also commits to continue active annual sourcing of 100% renewable electricity through to 2030. JCDecaux SE further commits to reduce absolute scope 3 GHG emissions from purchased goods and services  capital goods  fuel and energy related activities  business travel and employee commuting by 46.2% within the same timeframe.Long-Term Targets: JCDecaux SE commits to reduce absolute scope 1  2 and 3 GHG emissions by 90% by 2050 from a 2019 base year 2 . JCDecaux SE also commits to continue active annual sourcing of 100% renewable electricity through to 2050.JCDecaux’s reduction trajectory is based on internal levers as well as external factors. As scope 3 accounts for more than 90% of its carbon footprint (market based)  reaching the target will be a collective journey requiring the collaboration of all its stakeholders. Since JCDecaux’s furniture footprint accounts for 42% of its scope 3 emissions  it will need to cooperate with its suppliers to offer the market even more efficient low-carbon solutions without compromising on quality. To deliver this  JCDecaux will need to focus upon even more responsible public/ private procurement based on compelling and assessed environmental and social criteria as well as partnerships with landlords.Since its very beginning in 1964  JCDecaux has placed sustainability and efficiency at the heart of its business model. The Group created a Sustainable Development and Quality Department in 2007  set out an ambitious Sustainable Development Strategy in 2014  which was updated in 2022  and unveiled its ambitious Climate Strategy in 2023. In France  JCDecaux is contributing to the collective effort set by the public authorities  in particular by the voluntary adoption of a Climate Contract and by respecting its commitment to reducing its energy consumption by 10% in 2024 compared to 2019. JCDecaux designs  installs  and maintains light infrastructure (bus shelters  street furniture  self-cleaning public toilets  self-service bicycles  etc.) in public spaces and travel hubs thanks to the financing provided by the advertising for brands and companies displayed on that infrastructure. JCDecaux street furniture provide innovative and free services for millions of people around the world  as well as for local authorities and transport companies  based on resource-efficient management. This business model is virtuous in three ways: economically  ecologically  and socially.Jean-Charles Decaux  Chairman of the Executive Board and Co-Chief Executive Officer of JCDecaux  said: ""One year on from unveiling and starting to deploy our ambitious Climate Strategy geared towards the goal of “Net Zero Carbon”  we are very proud to achieve the validation of the SBTi after a multi-step process. Reducing our environmental footprint is one of JCDecaux's long-standing commitments. Our virtuous business model resonates with the Green Taxonomy  as nearly 50% of our 2023 revenues are aligned with this European regulation. As the number one worldwide in our business sector  we are determined to play an active role in the collective response to the challenges of climate change and to make outdoor advertising a driver of the ecological transition. JCDecaux will continue to work with all its stakeholders and to support those involved in public and private procurement to ensure that it becomes a powerful and effective driver of sustainable development  based upon quality as well as ambitious environmental and social criteria. It is through systemic actions and by engaging our entire value chain that we will contribute to Net Zero Carbon.""1 The target boundary includes land-related emissions and removals from bioenergy feedstocks.2 The target boundary includes land-related emissions and removals from bioenergy feedstocks.*Scope 1: Direct emissionsResulting from the manufacturing of products or the combustion of fuel for company vehicles (natural gas  oil  etc.)​Scope 2: Indirect emissionsAssociated with energy consumption that does not directly pollute (electricity  etc.)​Scope 3: Other indirect emissionsLinked to the rest of the company's activities (procurement  transport  end-of-life cycle  employee travel  etc.)​**Market-basedMethod of calculating CO 2 emissions linked to electricity consumption  based on emissions factors associated with the supplier from which the company buys its electricity.

We are also pleased to have gained the interest and support of Samsara BioCapital  a leading U.S. specialized fund. With this transaction completed  we continue to focus on advancing the development of lanifibranor  one of the most promising drugs in MASH/NASH  and we are pursuing our evaluation of strategic and financing options to fully support its development.”Reasons for the issuance and use of the proceeds of the TransactionThe Company intends to use approximately 95% of the net proceeds from the Transaction to continue the NATiV3 Phase III trial of lanifibranor in MASH/ NASH (“NATiV3”) and the remainder for general corporate purposes.Before giving effect to the Transaction and the cash preservation measures implemented by the Company with its creditors  considering the Company’s cost structure and forecasted expenditures  the Company estimated that its cash  cash equivalents and deposits allowed the Company to fund its operations as planned until the beginning of the third quarter of 2024. As of June 30  2024  the Company’s cash and cash equivalents are estimated (non-audited) to be €10.1 million  compared with €9.6 million  €0.1 million2 of short-term deposits and €10 million3 of long-term deposits as of May 31  2024.Considering its current cost structure and forecasted expenditures and including the proceeds of approximately €20.1 million from the issuance of the Royalty Certificates and the cash preservation measures in the short term set up by the Company with its creditors  the Company estimates that its cash  cash equivalents and deposits should allow the Company to fund its operations through September 2024. These factors raise substantial doubt regarding the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern beyond the end of September 2024.The Company explored a variety of options  including the issuance of debt  equity and other instruments  prior to deciding to enter into the Transaction. In order to finance its activities beyond the end of September 2024  the Company will need to raise additional funds  and it is continuing to actively review potential financing (including debt  equity and equity-linked or other instruments) and strategic options.Main characteristics of the TransactionThe Royalty Certificates are being issued pursuant to a decision of Board of Directors on July 16  2024  in accordance with the provisions of Article L. 228-36-A of the French Commercial Code (Code de commerce) to one new investor and existing shareholders.The Royalty Certificates give the holders thereto the right to an annual payment of royalties (the ""Royalties"") equal to 3% of the future net sales of lanifibranor (the ""Product"")  if any  beginning on the fiscal year following the start of the sales of the Product following the potential granting of the market authorization (Autorisation de mise sur le marché) for the Product in (i) the United States of America or (ii) the countries of the European Union or (iii) the United Kingdom  whichever occurs the first.The Royalty Certificates do not have any additional financial rights besides the right to payment of Royalties referred to above. Specifically  the Royalty Certificates do not grant any financial rights on any other products that may be developed by the Company beyond lanifibranor.The subscription price for the Royalty Certificates is €20.1 million and has been calculated taking into account the net present value (“NPV”) of expected cash flows related to the Royalty Certificates and the current financial position of the Company. The NPV calculation depends strongly on assumptions made by the Company with regards to the chances of success of its studies  the commercialization calendar of lanifibranor  the market size addressed for lanifibranor  the market share of the product and the discount rate. In the process of setting the discount rate  the Company analyzed the expected cash flow derived from its business plan as regards to its market capitalization.The Royalty Certificates have a term of 14 years following their issuance and do not provide for an accelerated repayment in case of change of control. The Company may at any time repurchase in full the Royalty Certificates by paying a price to be agreed between the Company and the holders of the Royalty Certificates. The Company may also redeem the Royalty Certificates from each holder  subject to offering such redemption to every holders. Lastly  the Company has a pre-emptive right in the event of the sale of Royalty Certificates by a holder.The holders of Royalty Certificates are subject to a 6-month lock-up period after which the Royalty Certificates will become freely transferable (in whole or in part  provided that the transfer involves a minimum number of 10 Royalty Certificates) only pursuant to an exemption from the registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act of 1933  as amended  (the “Securities Act”)and to qualified investors pursuant to Article 2(e) of Regulation (EU) 2017/1129. The Company will have a preemptive right on any transfer of Royalty Certificates.Settlement and delivery of the Royalty Certificates is expected to occur on July 22  2024. The Royalty Certificates will not be listed on any stock exchange and will not be assigned an ISIN. The closing of the Transaction is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.It is reminded that these Royalty Certificates are independent from the royalty certificates issued in August 2023  and do not have the same characteristics (see the Company's press release published on August 31  2023) (the “2023 Royalty Certificates”).The Royalty Certificates will be issued in a private placement exempt from registration under the Securities Act and have not been  and will not be  registered under the Securities Act  and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements.The issue and subscription of the Royalty Certificates will not result in any change in the shareholder structure (for a description of the share capital  please refer to section 6.1.1 of the Company's 2023 Universal Registration Document dated April 3  2024).Important noticeThe Transaction has not been the subject of a prospectus submitted to the Autorité des Marchés Financiers for its approval.The payment of Royalties for the Royalty Certificates and of royalties for the 2023 Royalty Certificates in the event of the commercialization of the Product (respectively  3% and 5% of sales of the Product in the United States  in European Union countries and in the United Kingdom)  if approved  would result in a decrease in cash flow generated by sales of the Product  which will have an unfavorable effect on the Company's financial position  particularly at the beginning of the commercialization phase.Please refer to the Universal Registration Document for the year ended December 31  2023  filed with the Autorité des Marchés Financiers on April 3  2024  and the Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31  2023  filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) on April 3  2024 for other risks and uncertainties affecting Inventiva  including those described under the caption “Risk Factors”  and in our future filings with the SEC. Other risks and uncertainties of which Inventiva is not currently aware may also affect its forward-looking statements and may cause actual results and the timing of events to differ materially from those anticipated.

Except as required by law  Inventiva has no intention and is under no obligation to update or review the forward-looking statements referred to above. Consequently  Inventiva accepts no liability for any consequences arising from the use of any of the above statements.Financial CalendarThe Company intends to publish the cash position and revenue as of June 30  2024 as planned on July 31  2024.About InventivaInventiva is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the research and development of oral small molecule therapies for the treatment of patients with MASH/NASH and other diseases with significant unmet medical need.

It is part of the ZEPIZURE® manufacturing program  which includes several batches from its commercial site  aimed at confirming  among other parameters  the shelf-life of ZEPIZURE®. These new advances are in line with previous long-term stability data.Manufacturing batches are critical parts of the dossier that will be submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to support ZEPIZURE®’s application for EUA. Combined with our upcoming U.S. bioequivalence study  they will also form the bedrock of our future New Drug Application filings from 2025 onward.Completion of this registration batch now paves the way for gathering new data  which will further demonstrate the quality of the products manufactured with the new equipment and ensure their satisfactory regulatory standing for widespread commercial use  starting with its delivery to the U.S. Government for national preparedness. Crossject is targeting its next milestones with the FDA regarding EUA of ZEPIZURE® for status epilepticus seizures in Q1 2025.“We are very pleased with the progress in setting-up a new CDMO partner  increasing fill-and-finish capabilities for ZENEO®. The successful production of this registration batch  as well as the earlier batches  are a testament to the hard work and dedication of both teams over the last 18 months. Beyond ZEPIZURE®  these achievements in our manufacturing process  regulatory standing and industrial scale-up truly have strategic value as a prelude to a broad deployment of our ZENEO® technology in epilepsy and in our other targeted market opportunities ” said Patrick Alexandre  CEO of Crossject.About CrossjectCrossject SA (Euronext: ALCJ; www.crossject.com ) is an emerging specialty pharmaceuticals company developing medicines for emergency situations harnessing its award-winning needle-free auto-injector ZENEO® platform.

This marks the 3rd consecutive year of sales in excess of € 100 million  and is 24% higher than in 2019 (the pre-covid reference year)Sales are stable in France  but down 8.7% on export  with a marked decline in certain European countries such as Germany and Italy  and Japan due to the devaluation of the yen.As a result  exports accounted for 64% of half-year consolidated sales  compared with 67% in the first half of 2023.Champagne BranchChampagne sales amounted to €94 million  down 6.7% on H1 2023. Volumes were down across the board in all markets  but price increases cushioned the impact.The Group is pursuing its value-creation strategy based on the quality of its products  its creativity and its strong historical position in France.To illustrate this ambition  in 2024 Champagne Pommery & Greno presented a new cuvée to mark the 150th anniversary of the creation of Brut in 1874 by Madame Pommery : Pommery Grand Apanage 1874. This multi-millimeter Brut  dedicated to gourmets  offers lovers of great Champagnes a new ""Pommery Experience #1""  that of taste and the pleasure of tasting.Wine  Ports and Sparkling Wines BranchSales were stable at €14 million.Poor weather conditions in the regions where rosé wines are most widely consumed had a negative impact on consumer buying decisions  resulting in a 20% drop in sales.Sales of Ports and Douro Wines rose by 3.5%  thanks to strong export momentum.Sparkling Wines sales were up in France and Europe  but showed more mixed performances outside Europe.Société à Mission « la Vérité du Terroir »The “Comité de Mission” has chosen 2024 as the year to preserve biodiversity.In all our vineyards and on our production sites  initiatives aimed at protecting soil  conserving water resources and preserving flora and fauna are being promoted both within and outside the Group.Concrete actions have already been implemented:Restoration of low stone walls that provide shelter for certain plant species and small reptiles.Maintenance of “roubines” in the Camargue regionrevegetation of embankmentsInstallation of perches for birds of preyUse of plant cover in vineyards to avoid the use of herbicidesPlanting hedges to attract animals and insects and create biodiversity corridorsThe installation of 30 beehives connected to 10 sites through the Bee'iodiv project.Other initiatives involving our stakeholders are in the pipeline  such as Vert Cot'Eau 2.0  in partnership with the Agence de l'Eau Seine-Normandie and Avize Viti Campus  with the ambition of encouraging the establishment of biodiversity by mobilizing the various partners present on the same hillside. The rationale behind this collective project is to create an ecological link between the green (forest  vineyards  meadows) and blue (rivers) webs in the area.ForecastIn Champagne  weather conditions have been particularly unfavorable since the start of the year: spring frosts  coulure and millerandage at flowering  and very high mildew pressure due to heavy rainfall.

Adjusted for this base effect  growth was 6% over the period.All other activities grew over the period.Cash and cash equivalents stood at €2 835k at June 30.EVRY  France--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Regulatory News:IntegraGen (FR0010908723 “ ALINT “ Eligible PEA PME)  an OncoDNA company specializing in the genomics of cancer and rare genetic diseases  which performs interpretable genomic analyses for academic and private laboratories  announces today its unaudited sales for the first half of 2024.Sales for the first half came to €4 530k  down 20% on the first half of 2023. This decline is explained by the cessation in February 2024 of service activities for the SeqOIA platform  which internalized these activities on that date  in accordance with the terms of the contract won by IntegraGen in 2018. This activity generated €885k in H1  compared with €2 200k in H1 2023.Excluding revenues from this platform  sales grew by 6% during the period.The cash position at the end of June 2024 stood at €2 835k  down by one million compared with the situation at December 31  2023. This position includes the outstanding balance of €867k of the State Guaranteed Loan (PGE) obtained in 2020 as part of the pandemic  which the company continues to repay at a rate of €455k per year. The variation observed over the past half-year is explained by changes in customer payment terms and loan repayments.With a strengthening of the order book at the end of June  growth prospects remain clearly established on the basis of current sales momentum  multi-year contracts in place and the prospects opened up by the CLIA certification obtained in January 2024  which now enables IntegraGen to carry out studies for pharmaceutical companies as part of their development of innovative new molecules.Bernard Courtieu  CEO of IntegraGen  comments: The first half of the year  following the announcement of the end of the five-year contract with SeqOIA  was a particularly demanding challenge for IntegraGen. We met it by concentrating our efforts on the activities generating the highest margins. Obtaining CAP accreditation and CLIA (Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act) certification fits perfectly with this strategy  opening up the high value-added pharmaceutical industry market to IntegraGen. At the same time  IntegraGen has drastically reduced its workforce and taken its cost-cutting processes even further.The very first results reflect this new dynamic  with 6% growth in activities excluding SeqOIA and an 11% increase in the order book. It is therefore with determination and confidence that the company looks forward to the period ahead.Financial results for the first half of 2024 will be published on October 20  2024.ABOUT INTEGRAGENIntegraGen is an OncoDNA group company specializing in the genomics of cancer and rare genetic diseases.

(Euronext Amsterdam: VVY; NL00150002Q7) (Vivoryon)  a clinical stage company focused on the discovery and development of small molecule medicines to modulate the activity and stability of pathologically altered proteins  today announced that it will provide updates on its progress towards developing its lead asset varoglutamstat  an investigational QPCT/L inhibitor  in kidney disease during an R&D update call and webcast. The update includes new kidney function analysis in a diabetes subgroup from the VIVIAD Phase 2b study of varoglutamstat in Alzheimer’s disease  as well as the Company’s proposed development plan for varoglutamstat in its initial target indication  diabetic kidney disease (DKD).“The extremely promising data we are presenting today in a diabetes subgroup build on the strong body of evidence in the overall VIVIAD study population  where we observed a robust beneficial effect of varoglutamstat on kidney function ” said Frank Weber  MD  CEO of Vivoryon. “Specifically  new analysis reveals a significant and unique treatment effect in patients with diabetes which is coupled with additional potential health benefits on weight and blood pressure  and an excellent safety profile. Given these compelling results  we plan to advance varoglutamstat into a Phase 2 clinical study in patients with diabetic kidney disease  specifically in more advanced patients with a high risk of end stage kidney disease where there continues to be a significant unmet need for new therapies to stabilize and protect kidney function.”R&D Update: Key HighlightsSignificant Effect of Varoglutamstat in Diabetes Subgroup2New analysis of eGFR  a measure of kidney function  in a subgroup of patients with diabetes 1 in the VIVIAD Phase 2b study reveals a substantially higher treatment effect 3 of >8mL/min/1.73m2/year (p=0.02; varoglutamstat n=20 / placebo n=12) compared to the overall VIVIAD study population where the treatment effect was 3.4mL/min/1.73m2/year (p<0.001; varoglutamstat n=141 / placebo n=117).in the VIVIAD Phase 2b study reveals a substantially higher treatment effect of >8mL/min/1.73m2/year (p=0.02; varoglutamstat n=20 / placebo n=12) compared to the overall VIVIAD study population where the treatment effect was 3.4mL/min/1.73m2/year (p<0.001; varoglutamstat n=141 / placebo n=117). Promising additional effects observed in the diabetes subgroup in varoglutamstat treated patients included a reduction in liver transaminases (AST/ALT 4 reduction of 6 units average) a mild weight loss (- 4kg) a reduction in diastolic blood pressure (- 6 mmHg) All results reported were observed at 48 weeks of treatment versus baseline. Similar observations were not made in the placebo group nor in the overall VIVIAD study population.Data revealed that the positive effect on kidney function in the diabetes subgroup appears to be independent of any change in glycemic control (HbA1C remained steady over the period for the varoglutamstat group).A reduction of the plasma concentration of the inflammatory and fibrosis inducing pE-CCL2 (p=0.004) was observed in the varoglutamstat arm  indicating a strong anti-inflammatory effect.Varoglutamstat was well-tolerated at the dose tested (up to 600mg twice daily) and there were no meaningful differences in adverse events observed in renal and metabolic system organ classes versus placebo or the total population.Proposed Clinical Development Plan in Diabetic Kidney Disease5Despite advances in the standard of care for DKD  there remains a significant unmet need for new therapies to stabilize kidney function and prevent disease progression.Vivoryon plans to start a Phase 2 study in DKD that is intended to include patients with disease stages more advanced than those observed in the VIVIAD Phase 2 study  enabling an expansion of the overall target patient population. The Company envisages a placebo-controlled study of up to approximately 120 subjects with stage 3b/4 DKD and >100mg/g albuminuria/proteinuria. These subjects would be randomized 1:1 to varoglutamstat 600mg twice daily or placebo  on top of standard of care medications. Key endpoints are planned to include eGFR slope analysis  measures of albuminuria (UA(p)CR)  inflammation and fibrosis-related biomarkers  as well as safety.Collaborating with Key Experts to Advance Development StrategyThe Company is collaborating with medical advisors and industry leaders to further shape its shift towards inflammatory/fibrotic disease  including:Tobias B.

During this period  Xilam thus implemented its plan of reducing costs and preserving cash. More importantly  it has launched a strategy to strengthen its order book and return to growth. We announced the launch of two highly promising new series  Piggy Builders and Submarine Jim  and we are working on the development of a new animated feature film. These announcements testify the reactivity and creative strength of our studios  as well as the renewed confidence broadcasters have in the appeal of our content. We are entering a new cycle with confidence and the ambition for a rapid return to profitable growth(˜000 euros) 30.06.2024 (1) 30.06.2023 % change Sales of new productions and developments 9 290 14 431 -36% Catalogue sales 2 296 3 716 -38% Total sales 11 585 18 147 -36% Grants (2) 1 687 2 351 -28% Total sales and grants 13 273 20 498 -35% Other current operating revenue (including ATC (3)) 449 797 ns Total operating revenue 13 722 21 295 -36%(1) Unaudited data(2) Total grants (new productions and catalogue)(3) Estimated Audiovisual Tax Credit (CIA)Sales of new productions and developments down 36%  as expected.Sales of new productions and developments reached €9.3 million  down 36% compared to the first half of 2023. This decline was anticipated due to the reduction in orders from US streaming platforms in the kids segment  announced in October 2023.The proportion of servicing (work for hire) remains high at 71% (compared to 83% in the first half of 2023)  confirming the success of the Group's diversification into the young-adult segment for streamning platforms. The Group worked on five such productions during the first half: two for Netflix (NASDAQ: )  Twilight of the Gods an epic action series for a young-adult audience  and The Seven Bears  a 3D series for family (Folivari production); two for Disney+  The Doomies  a horror comedy for teen viewers  and the conclusion of the second season of Chip 'n Dale  for a family audience; and one for France TÃ©lÃ©visions  My Life in Versailles  also for a family audience (Films Grand Huit production).Proprietary productions accounted for 29% of sales  with three productions: the fourth season of Zig & Sharko  the second season of Lupin's Tales and the first season of Buddybot an eco-comedy for children aimed at France TV.Catalogue sales at €2.3 millionCatalogue sales amounted to €2.3 million  down 38%. These sales should be evaluated from an annual perspective  as the second half of the year is traditionally much higher due to the concentration of AVOD advertising sales in the final quarter. Significant renewals of major catalogue franchises are also expected at the end of the year.Total sales  excluding grants  at €11.6 millionTotal sales  excluding grants  amounted to €11.6m.International sales accounted for 76% of that total  down slightly on the 86% figure for the first half of 2023.Digital streaming platforms accounted for 66% of sales  compared with 75% in the first half of 2023. They were driven by new productions and developments  while traditional linear channels still make up the majority share in the catalogue.Lastly  the first half confirmed the trend towards young-adult series  which accounted for 43% of the total  compared with 41% in the first half of 2023  and even 54% for new productions alone  reflecting the Group's successful development in this segment.Total operating income at €13.7 millionGrants amounted to €1.7m  giving total sales and grants of €13.3 million.Other current operating revenue was €0.4m  bringing total operating revenue to €13.7 million.Implementation of the strategy to strengthen links with European channels.The Group launched the production of two new series during the first half of the year. Financed on a proprietary model  these projects bring together France TÃ©lÃ©visions  ZDF  and the BBC for Piggy Builders  a 3D pre-school series  and France TÃ©lÃ©visions and Super RTL for Submarine Jim  a comedy aimed at kids.Following the great success of the acclaimed and Academy Award ®-nominated I Lost My Body a few years ago  the Group is making progress on a new feature film project  Lucy Lost  which is due to be announced in the second half of the year.Finally  the Group is in active discussions with several American commissioners regarding prestigious productions.Rigorous cash management and adaptation of the fixed cost structure.As announced  the Group implemented cost-saving measures in the first half of the year  mainly relating to property leases (by grouping operations on three sites instead of five)  marketing  personnel and IT. The Group confirms that it will amount to around €3m over a full year.In January 2024  the Group carried out a capital increase of €3.7m  strengthening its equity and increasing its liquidity by the same amount. Financial debt at 30 June 2024 will therefore be significantly lower than at 31 December 2023.Very high visibility at the Annecy FestivalXilam received a very enthusiastic welcome at the Annecy Festival. Disney and Netflix showcased the young-adult series produced by the Group  Doomies and Twilight of the Gods  with spectacular marketing campaigns. The series My Life in Versailles also won the prize for best television series. This visibility strengthens Xilam's attractiveness to its clients and reinforces its unique position in the premium animation market.On this occasion  the CNC's annual study of the animation sector was published  confirming the Group's position as France's leading animation studio for the period 2018-2023.The group is maintaining its forecast of a current operating income close to breakeven for the full year 2024  with the ambition of a rapid return to profitable growthCalendarPublication of 2024 first-half results: 30 September 2024 (after market close)About XilamA major player in animation  Xilam is an integrated studio founded in 1999 that creates  produces and distributes original programmes in more than 190 countries for both children and adult audiences.

Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium  July 18  2024  7.00...,"Press ReleaseThe upcoming Phase 3 trial with ATO is more robust following a new post-hoc analysis.Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium  July 18  2024  7.00 am CEST – BIOSENIC (Euronext Brussels and Paris: BIOS)  the clinical-stage company specializing in serious autoimmune and inflammatory diseases therapy  today announced the final results of a new  detailed post-hoc analysis of the Company's previous Phase 2 clinical trial of ATO for the first-line curative treatment of cGvHD. The analysis will be used to determine the optimal posology of therapeutic oral ATO administration for BioSenic's upcoming clinical trial(s) and will be submitted for peer review prior to preparation of the necessary regulatory filings for trial approvals.Medsenic's first phase 2 clinical trial  entitled ""Treatment of Chronic Graft Versus Host Disease With Arsenic Trioxide (GvHD-ATO)""  was conducted from 2016 to 2020 (ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT02966301 - GMED16-001). Medsenic's global results were originally published in 2022 in the peer-reviewed journal Transplantation and Cellular Therapy under the title ""High Response Rate and Corticosteroid Sparing with Arsenic Trioxide-Based First-Line Therapy in Chronic Graft-versus-Host Disease after Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation"". These results demonstrated that the first-line combination of ATO and corticosteroids (CS) with or without a calcineurin inhibitor (cyclosporine) is associated with a high clinical response rate and rapid CS sparing in moderate to severe cGVHD following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)  the current standard of care for several types of leukemia. The primary endpoint of the Phase 2 study was preliminary efficacy based on the overall response rate (ORR; complete response [CR] or partial response [PR]) at 6 months after 1 or 2 cycles of 4-week treatment. At 6 months  the ORR was 75.0%  with a CR rate of 35% and a PR rate of 40%.BioSenic's new in-depth post-hoc clinical analysis of the Phase 2 clinical data now shows that in the group of patients who did not respond after first so-called induction cycle  more patients (20%) responded after a consolidation cycle of treatment. As a result  BioSenic will continue to use this 2-cycle  time-limited regimen. This will consist of a double four-week course. In addition  BioSenic has determined that an increase in the number of weekly injections over a four-week course could significantly increase the positive effect of the treatment on the biological and cellular parameters of the disease  consistent with a full effect of the drug at levels determined to be very safe for patients. BioSenic's goal is to finally select the best conditions for administering effective and safe doses of arsenic trioxide to achieve a convincing curative treatment of cGvHD  for which there is currently no alternative effective long-term therapy.In the field of oncology  intravenous (IV) ATO has been accepted as a first-line treatment for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) since 2002  with demonstrated safety and long-term remissions. Until now  ATO in APL has been administered daily by IV infusion for up to or more than one hundred cumulative doses. IV administration requires hospitalization  is inconvenient for patients  results in reduced quality of life and is expensive. The anticipated introduction of an oral formulation of ATO in 2 cycles of four full weeks each  corresponding to an optimal dosing regimen  will significantly improve patient quality of life and compliance while reducing healthcare costs. This will be the next achievement in BioSenic's broader goal to contribute improved and potentially curative treatments for an autoimmune disease for which there are currently no satisfactory medical solutions.François Rieger  PhD  Chairman and CEO  BioSenic said: ""BioSenic's early preclinical and current clinical data show that the first-in-class modulatory properties of arsenic trioxide for immune cells differentiation and homeostatic maintenance of the immune system are much broader and deeper than previously anticipated. The systematic and renewed analysis of BioSenic's key clinical results in the treatment of cGvHD is providing additional insights into the optimization of its formulations  dosages and optimal treatment timing  in line with new basic research on the drug's mechanisms of action. We are now able to propose definitive conditions for the optimal use of arsenic trioxide for an upcoming pivotal Phase 3 trial of our ATO formulation for chronic Graft-versus-Host disease. ""About BioSenicBioSenic is a leading biotech company specializing in the development of clinical assets issued from its Medsenic’s arsenic trioxide (ATO) platform. Key target indications for the autoimmune platform include graft-versus-host-disease (GvHD)  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  and now systemic sclerosis (SSc).Following the merger in October 2022  BioSenic combined the strategic positionings and strengths of Medsenic and Bone Therapeutics. The merger specifically enables Medsenic/Biosenic to develop an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/oral ATO (OATO).BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About the main Medsenic/BioSenic technology platformThe ATO platform provides derived active products with immunomodulatory properties and fundamental effects on the activated cells of the immune system. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. cGvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT).Medsenic has been successful in a phase 2 trial with its intravenous formulation  Arscimed®  which has orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA. The company is heading towards an international phase 3 confirmatory study  with its new  IP-protected  OATO formulation. Another selected target is moderate-to-severe forms of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae  and the gastrointestinal tract). Systemic sclerosis is now full part of the clinical pipeline of Medsenic/BioSenic. This serious chronic disease badly affects skin  lungs  or vascularization  and has no current effective treatment.

Our sales grew in the second quarter of 2024  driven by a rebound in our US business  where we more than doubled sales over the period  partially offsetting the decrease in sales in Europe  which had benefited from the Linde (NYSE: ) Material commitment in H1 2023. Over the coming months  BALYO will focus on further implementing its commercial ambitions to get back to growth with emphasis on direct sales in order to ensure its commercial autonomy. With regards to our cash position  and despite the shareholder loan obtained from our majority shareholder earlier this year  the latest should be positive until November 2024. BALYO is working from now on on extending its financial visibility and maintaining very tight control over its costs to preserve its cash position.In thousands of euros Q12023 Q2 2023 H12023 Q12024 Q2 2024 H12024 Change Q2 24/Q2 23 Change H124/H1 23 EMEA Region 5 736 5 064 10 800 3 235 2 675 5 910 -47% -45% Region Americas 1 388 1 871 3 259 1 591 5 035 6 626 +169% +103% APAC Region 104 707 811 422 826 1 248 +17% +54% Salespublished 7 228 7 642 14 870 5 247 8 536 13 784 +12% -7%Unaudited dataQ2 and H1 2024 sales and activityIn the second quarter of 2024  the Company recorded sales at €8.5 million  compared to €7.6 million in Q2 2023  up 12%. In total  BALYO posted sales at €13.8 million for the first half of 2024  a slight decrease of 7% compared with the first half of 2023.As a reminder  sales for the first half of 2023 had benefited from the order commitment contract from Linde Material Handling. By region  lower activity can be observed in the EMEA region in the first half of 2024  where BALYO posted sales of €5.9 million  down -45%. Sales in the United States and APAC grew by +103% and +54% in the first half of 2024 respectively.In the second quarter of 2024  BALYO's sales momentum was driven by a 69% increase in order intake  reaching €5.5 million  compared to €3.3 million in Q2 2023. After incorporating new orders  the backlog sets at €17.9 million as of June 30  2024  up sharply over €10.3 million as of June 30  2023. The geographical breakdown shows a surge in the backlog  both in the United States (+215%) and the APAC region (+116%)  while the business in EMEA slightly declined.Over the period  direct order intake represented 68% of total orders received  compared with 24% at end of Q2 2023  a level of performance very close to the Company's ambitions.Financial position and outlookOn June 30  2024  BALYO's cash position2 stood at €4.6 million  compared to €8.6 million as of December 31  2023.Since BALYO's Q1 press release dated April 23  2024  BALYO's cash flow forecasts were adjusted downwards to reflect 2nd quarter order intake. This deterioration is attributed to delays in order intake during the period.As a reminder  in March 2024  BALYO successfully secured a Shareholder Loan with SoftBank (TYO: ) Group  its indirect majority shareholder  for a total amount of up to €12 million  which has been signed on March 21  2024. At the date hereof and after taking into account the amounts drawn down  the amount available under the Shareholder Loan is €6 million. This loan  which may be repaid by offsetting of receivables as part of a capital increase  is subject to covenants3 on revenue and operating cash-flow calculated on a quarterly basis by the Company  the latter being under a duty to issue a compliance certificate every quarter. These covenants remain unchanged at the date hereof.Based on its cash position at the end of June 2024  firm orders intake and the level of the backlog at the date of this press release and current orders and operational execution on projects forecasts  BALYO's cash position is expected to be positive until November 2024.However  BALYO considers that in the event of commercial orders falling short of expectations  the Company might not be able to realize its assets and liabilities and settle its debts in the normal course of business before November 2024. As a result  there is an uncertainty regarding BALYO's ability to continue as a going concern  which will be mentioned in the auditors' report on the H1 consolidated accounts.Given these factors  in the second half of 2024  BALYO will work on extending its financial visibility and will particularly pay attention to work in the rebound of its commercial momentum  by leveraging on its model based on direct sales  while maintaining very tight control over its costs to preserve its cash position.Next BALYO financial announcement: half-year results 2024  on September 26  2024 after market closing.About BALYOHumans around the World deserve enriching and creative jobs.

This causes major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care  they become ineffective  intolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing ""diuretic-resistant"" patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  delivering major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients and reducing costs for healthcare systems.The Company's Premarket Approval (PMA) application for the alfapump was submitted to the US FDA in December 2023 and accepted for substantive review in January 2024  having reported positive primary and secondary endpoint data from the North American pivotal POSEIDON study in recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis. US market approval of the alfapump is anticipated before the end of Q1 2025 with US commercial launch planned for H2 2025.Results of the Company's RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure support DSR's mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE  a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study  have been successfully treated with DSR  resulting in a dramatic improvement in diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements. The independent Data Safety Monitoring Board approved the start of the randomized MOJAVE cohort of up to a further 30 patients  which is planned after alfapump US PMA approval.Sequana Medical is listed on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent  Belgium. For further information  please visit www.sequanamedical.com.Important Regulatory DisclaimersThe alfapump® system is currently not approved in the United States or Canada. In the United States and Canada  the alfapump system is currently under clinical investigation (POSEIDON Trial) and is being studied in adult patients with refractory or recurrent ascites due to liver cirrhosis. DSR® therapy is still in development and it should be noted that any statements regarding safety and efficacy arise from ongoing pre-clinical and clinical investigations which have yet to be completed. There is no link between DSR therapy and ongoing investigations with the alfapump system in Europe  the United States or Canada.Note: alfapump® and DSR® are registered trademarks.Forward-looking statementsThis press release may contain predictions  estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking statements.

The losses were compounded by a far-reaching cyber outage that hit shares of cybersecurity company CrowdStrike hard ,"Wall Street's main indexes plummeted Friday on heavy selling of technology shares and mixed earnings.The losses were compounded by a far-reaching cyber outage that hit shares of cybersecurity company CrowdStrike hard  off 11.2 per cent to the lowest in more than two months.The CrowdStrike outage affected its product update for Microsoft's Windows Operating System  paralysing activities across several industries.Major US airlines were ordering ground stops due to communication problems  while both the Euronext exchange and London Stock Exchange Group's Workspace news and data platform were hit by issues.The LSEG later said its data and services were back online  but the initial disruptions had already dented investor sentiment.Microsoft also slid 0.7 per cent  to over a one-month low  and extended its losses for a fourth consecutive day.Microsoft's stock drop contributed to an overall rout in tech stocks. ""Any hint of bad news because they're so priced to perfection is going to hurt these stocks "" said Phil Blancato  CEO of Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management.Even so  Blancato cites CrowdStrike and Microsoft as two great long-term investment opportunities.The latest turmoil comes after Wall Street experienced two bruising sessions  as investors grappled with second-quarter earnings reports and turned averse to the mega-caps that had broadly led the equity rally in 2024.Big technology stocks moved in both directions  with Nvidia and Amazon.com down 1 per cent and 0.5 per cent  respectively  and Apple and Alphabet up 1 per cent apiece.Chip stocks were another mixed bag  with U.S.-listed shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing down nearly 1.5 per cent  and Arm Holdings rose 3 per cent.

Eli Lilly jumped 2.6 per cent on news that China approved its weight-loss drug tripeptide.Intuitive Surgical surged 8 per cent after reporting second-quarter earnings well above expectations. Those updates helped the S&P 500 healthcare index lead sectoral gainers.On the other hand  Netflix fell 1 per cent in choppy trading following the streaming service's forecast of third-quarter subscriber additions below expectations and lower than a year earlier.Oilfield services provider SLB rose 1.3 per cent following strong second-quarter profits.Based on the most recent reports  S&P 500 corporations have posted an earnings beat rate of 85 per cent and an overall growth rate of 11.1 per cent.However  market breadth was still soft.

This causes major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care  they become ineffective  intolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing ""diuretic-resistant"" patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  delivering major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients and reducing costs for healthcare systems.The Company's Premarket Approval (PMA) application for the alfapump was submitted to the US FDA in December 2023 and accepted for substantive review in January 2024  having reported positive primary and secondary endpoint data from the North American pivotal POSEIDON study in recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis. US market approval of the alfapump is anticipated before the end of Q1 2025 with US commercial launch planned for H2 2025.Results of the Company's RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure support DSR's mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE  a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study  have been successfully treated with DSR  resulting in a dramatic improvement in diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements. The independent Data Safety Monitoring Board approved the start of the randomized MOJAVE cohort of up to a further 30 patients  which is planned after alfapump US PMA approval.Sequana Medical is listed on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent  Belgium.
