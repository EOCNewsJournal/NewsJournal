43928,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rt.com/business/601338-eu-depositary-confiscation-russian-assets/,Ukraine to get first $1.5 billion of seized Russian cash – Euroclear,Euroclear has confirmed that it will start transferring interest generated by frozen Russian funds to Ukraine this month Read Full Article at RT.com,The first payout from interest generated by Moscow’s frozen funds will be made this month  the EU-based depository has saidBrussels-based depositary and clearing house Euroclear has confirmed that it will confiscate interest generated by the frozen Russian funds that it holds and will transfer the money to Ukraine.“In July 2024  Euroclear will make a first payment of €1.55 billion to the European Fund for Ukraine following the recent implementation of the EU regulation on the windfall contribution ” Euroclear said in a statement on Friday.It follows months of deliberations among EU and G7 nations about how to use billions of dollars belonging to Russia’s central bank that were immobilized as part of Ukraine-related sanctions.The announcement came as part of a report on the financial results for the first half of 2024  which revealed that frozen Russian assets had generated €3.4 billion ($3.7 billion) of the €4 billion ($4.36 billion) interest accrued by the clearing house during the six-month period.After tax  the windfall amounts to €1.7 billion ($1.85 billion)  €1.55 billion ($1.7 billion) of which will be sent to Ukraine. The remainder will be “put aside as a buffer against current and future risks.” A total of €836 million ($910 million) will be paid to Belgium in corporate taxes  the statement added. Euroclear said it is continuing to “diligently implement the international sanctions on Russian assets.”The EU immobilized around €210 billion ($229 billion) of sovereign assets belonging to Russia’s central bank as part of sanctions imposed on Moscow over the conflict in Ukraine. The bulk of the funds is held in the privately owned depository. The clearing house previously reported that the assets had generated roughly €4.4 billion ($4.8 billion) in interest last year.In June  the EU Foreign Affairs Council announced that it would make windfall profits from immobilized Russian funds available to Ukraine. The first tranche will be used to purchase ammunition and air-defense systems  it said  adding that another €1 billion will be transferred by the end of the year.Some G7 members  such as the US and the UK  had been pushing for the outright seizure of Russian assets. Concerns over the legality of such a move led to a decision to use the interest generated by the funds instead.Russia has repeatedly said any actions taken against its assets would amount to “theft ” insisting that seizing the funds or similar moves would violate international law and lead to retaliation.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov warned this week that “illegal attempts to rob the Russian Federation” would cause huge damage to the international financial system.,neutral,0.01,0.73,0.27,negative,0.0,0.28,0.71,True,English,"['Russian cash', 'Ukraine', 'first', 'Euroclear', 'EU Foreign Affairs Council', 'international financial system', 'frozen Russian assets', 'financial results', 'international law', 'Russian Federation', 'first payout', 'Brussels-based depositary', 'first payment', 'European Fund', 'recent implementation', 'EU regulation', 'G7 nations', 'central bank', 'first half', 'six-month period', 'future risks', 'corporate taxes', 'international sanctions', 'first tranche', 'air-defense systems', 'G7 members', 'outright seizure', 'similar moves', 'Kremlin spokesman', 'Dmitry Peskov', 'illegal attempts', 'huge damage', 'sovereign assets', 'windfall contribution', 'Ukraine-related sanctions', 'windfall profits', 'EU-based depository', 'Russian funds', 'clearing house', 'interest', 'Moscow', 'Euroclear', 'money', 'July', 'statement', 'Friday', 'months', 'deliberations', 'billions', 'dollars', 'part', 'announcement', 'report', 'remainder', 'buffer', 'current', 'total', 'Belgium', 'conflict', 'bulk', 'June', 'ammunition', 'end', 'year', 'Concerns', 'legality', 'decision', 'actions', 'retaliation', '€']",2024-07-19,2024-07-20,rt.com

It seems to me that investors all over the world have shuddered a little.

It's just a new word "" Klishas said on Sputnik radio.Many investors will reconsider their attitude to the European market  he believes.""Saudi Arabia has already drawn the attention of Europeans to the fact that if Russian assets are confiscated  then Saudi Arabia can get rid of European debt obligations from its portfolio.

This causes major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care  they become ineffective  intolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing ""diuretic-resistant"" patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  delivering major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients and reducing costs for healthcare systems.The Company's Premarket Approval (PMA) application for the alfapump was submitted to the US FDA in December 2023 and accepted for substantive review in January 2024  having reported positive primary and secondary endpoint data from the North American pivotal POSEIDON study in recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis. US market approval of the alfapump is anticipated before the end of Q1 2025 with US commercial launch planned for H2 2025.Results of the Company's RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure support DSR's mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE  a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study  have been successfully treated with DSR  resulting in a dramatic improvement in diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements. The independent Data Safety Monitoring Board approved the start of the randomized MOJAVE cohort of up to a further 30 patients  which is planned after alfapump US PMA approval.Sequana Medical is listed on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent  Belgium. For further information  please visit www.sequanamedical.com.Important Regulatory DisclaimersThe alfapump® system is currently not approved in the United States or Canada. In the United States and Canada  the alfapump system is currently under clinical investigation (POSEIDON Trial) and is being studied in adult patients with refractory or recurrent ascites due to liver cirrhosis. DSR® therapy is still in development and it should be noted that any statements regarding safety and efficacy arise from ongoing pre-clinical and clinical investigations which have yet to be completed. There is no link between DSR therapy and ongoing investigations with the alfapump system in Europe  the United States or Canada.Note: alfapump® and DSR® are registered trademarks.Forward-looking statementsThis press release may contain predictions  estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking statements.

The details of the transparency notification are set out below and the full text of the transparency notification can be consulted on the website of BioSenic  under the heading “Major shareholders & transparency notices”.The transparency notification indicates that the voting rights attached to BioSenic's shares held by Mr François Rieger have crossed below the threshold of 5% as a result of the sale of shares of BioSenic.The transparency notification received from Mr François Rieger dated 18 July 2024 contains the following information:Reason for the notification: Downward crossing of the lowest threshold Acquisition or transfer of voting securities or voting rightsNotification by: A person that notifies alonePerson subject to the notification requirement: Mr François RiegerTransaction date: 17 July 2024Threshold that is crossed: 5%Denominator: 251 312 817About BioSenicBioSenic is a leading biotech company specializing in the development of clinical assets issued from its Medsenic’s arsenic trioxide (ATO) platform. Key target indications for the autoimmune platform include graft-versus-host-disease (GvHD)  systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  and now systemic sclerosis (SSc).Following the merger in October 2022  BioSenic combined the strategic positionings and strengths of Medsenic and Bone Therapeutics. The merger specifically enables Medsenic/Biosenic to develop an entirely new arsenal of various anti-inflammatory and anti-autoimmune formulations using the immunomodulatory properties of ATO/oral ATO (OATO).BioSenic is based in the Louvain-la-Neuve Science Park in Mont-Saint-Guibert  Belgium. Further information is available at http://www.biosenic.com.About the main Medsenic/BioSenic technology platformThe ATO platform provides derived active products with immunomodulatory properties and fundamental effects on the activated cells of the immune system. One direct application is its use in onco-immunology to treat GvHD (Graft-versus-Host Disease) in its chronic  established stage. cGvHD is one of the most common and clinically significant complications affecting long-term survival of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT).Medsenic has been successful in a phase 2 trial with its intravenous formulation  Arscimed®  which has orphan drug designation status by FDA and EMA. The company is heading towards an international phase 3 confirmatory study  with its new  IP-protected  OATO formulation. Another selected target is moderate-to-severe forms of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)  using the same oral formulation. ATO has shown good safety and significant clinical efficacy on several affected organs (skin  mucosae  and the gastrointestinal tract). Systemic sclerosis is now full part of the clinical pipeline of Medsenic/BioSenic. This serious chronic disease badly affects skin  lungs  or vascularization  and has no current effective treatment. Preclinical studies on pertinent animal models are positive  giving good grounds to launch a phase 2 clinical protocol  using new immunomodulatory formulations of APIs recognized to be active on the immune system.The company is currently focusing its present R&D and clinical activities on a selective  accelerated development of its autoimmune platform.Note: The allogeneic cell therapy platform-originating from the previous listed company Bone Therapeutics company  may be of renewed interest by using isolated and purified differentiated bone marrow Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (MSCs) as a starting material for further isolation of passive or active biological subcellular elements. Indeed  these cells may provide new subcellular vesicles potentially able to deliver a unique and proprietary approach to organ repair. BioSenic is now involved in determining new patentable approaches in this complex area of cell therapy.For further information  please contact:BioSenic SAFrançois Rieger  PhD  CEOTel: +33 (0)671 73 31 59investorrelations@biosenic.comCertain statements  beliefs and opinions in this press release are forward-looking  which reflect the company or  as appropriate  the company directors’ current expectations and projections about future events.

This  in turn  will positively impact international consumers  as their payment experience will be simpler and more streamlined  giving them more confidence to shop with international brands.The volume of non-cash transactions market is expected to continue its upward trajectory  with digital and mobile wallets  credit cards  debit cards  and bank transfers being the most frequently used payment methods both at point of sale and in e-commerce settings already. In addition  Millennials and Gen Z will constitute 72% of the global workforce by 2029. As they have grown up in an era where nearly everything is instantly accessible  they anticipate seamless experiences and European merchants must be prepared to meet their expectations. Businesses that implement effective frictionless payment experiences can  amongst other things  benefit from reduced shopping cart abandonment.By combining industry research  data  and proprietary insights  JCB and Worldline shared their views of how merchants can effectively create a frictionless payment journey for their customers  reflecting on the growing demand for frictionless payments among Asian consumers. As a result  this guide aims to provide actionable steps for European merchants who want to keep up with the expectations of a society that values speed and convenience  and who want greater access to new technologies and secure transaction processes.In addition  JCB emphasises the importance of merchants understanding their customer base to facilitate greater payment experiences especially in the travel industry. Tourism is a significant source of income for merchants  and the expectations for frictionless payments are high. This is especially crucial for Asian travellers  as language barriers and unfamiliar payment systems can pose potential obstacles. Offering mobile or contactless payments  supported by a transparent and secure process  can eliminate these barriers and provide the hassle-free experience that tourists seek.By publishing this guide  JCB aims to showcase that the adoption of new technologies and practices can reduce the steps needed in the transaction journey  while maintaining a secure process for both customers and merchants. Merchants who embrace these solutions and stay attuned to their customers' needs can thrive in today's fast-paced digital economy  while international travellers are able to experience a truly frictionless payment journey.Ray Shinzawa  Managing Director  JCB International (Europe) Ltd.  commented: ""At JCB  we are committed to providing our cardmembers with the best possible payments experience and we are keen to share our knowledge. We hope that this guide will equip merchants with the information and insights needed to understand both the 'why' behind frictionless payments' role in commerce today  and the 'how' when it comes to implementing an approach that yields results  grows your business  and meets the expectations of your customers.""Miranda Rodigas  Head of Scheme Management  Worldline Merchant Services  said: ""Worldline is committed to enhancing the payment experience for merchants and consumers alike. Our partnership with JCB in contributing to this new whitepaper signifies our dedication to ensuring European merchants have the resources and expertise needed to facilitate seamless payments for international consumers.
