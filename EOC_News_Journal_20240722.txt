This move comes in line with recent European Union regulations on the windfall contribution. Euroclear confirmed on Friday that it will deliver EUR1.55 billion to the European Fund for Ukraine in July 2024. This payment represents the interest generated from frozen Russian assets  which were immobilized under sanctions related to the conflict in Ukraine.The decision follows extensive discussions among European Union and G7 nations about the allocation of billions of dollars held by Russia's central bank that were frozen as part of sanctions. The announcement was made alongside Euroclear’s financial results for the first half of 2024  which revealed that the clearing house accrued EUR4 billion (USD4.36 billion) in interest during this period. Of this  EUR3.4 billion (USD3.7 billion) was attributed to the frozen Russian assets.After accounting for taxes  the windfall amounts to EUR1.7 billion (USD1.85 billion)  with EUR1.55 billion (USD1.7 billion) earmarked for Ukraine. The remaining funds will be reserved as a buffer against current and future risks. Additionally  EUR836 million (USD910 million) will be allocated to Belgium in corporate taxes. Euroclear reiterated its commitment to diligently implementing international sanctions on Russian assets.The European Union had previously immobilized approximately EUR210 billion (USD229 billion) of sovereign assets belonging to Russia's central bank as part of its sanctions. Most of these funds are held in Euroclear  which reported that the assets generated around EUR4.4 billion (USD4.8 billion) in interest last year.MENAFN22072024000045015687ID1108466251,neutral,0.0,0.66,0.34,negative,0.0,0.22,0.78,True,English,"['first USD', 'Russian money', 'Euroclear', 'Ukraine', 'recent European Union regulations', 'The European Union', 'European Fund', 'major depositary', 'clearing house', 'first installment', 'extensive discussions', 'G7 nations', 'central bank', 'financial results', 'first half', 'future risks', 'Russian assets', 'sovereign assets', 'Russian funds', 'remaining funds', 'windfall contribution', 'corporate taxes', 'international sanctions', 'Brussels-based Euroclear', 'MENAFN', 'Ukraine', 'move', 'line', 'Friday', 'July', 'payment', 'interest', 'conflict', 'decision', 'allocation', 'billions', 'dollars', 'part', 'announcement', 'period', 'buffer', 'current', 'Belgium', 'commitment']",2024-07-22,2024-07-22,menafn.com
