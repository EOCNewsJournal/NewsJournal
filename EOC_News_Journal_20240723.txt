Once the world’s largest asset managers and banks are on-chain  the next step is connecting them to the DeFi protocols already powered by Chainlink.Once there is a single standard for how transactions work correctly across multiple chains as well the two worlds of DeFi and TradFi  then we will enter a global Internet of Contracts  the true promise of what our industry has been working towards.”Nazarov references the launch of Chainlink’s Digital Assets Sandbox (DAS)  designed by Chainlink Labs and powered by its Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP).The Chainlink DAS aims to “accelerate digital asset innovation within financial institutions” by giving them access to “ready-to-use business workflows for digital assets.”According to Chainlink Labs  as an example  institutions can now use the DAS on several blockchain testnets to digitize a traditional bond by converting it into digital tokens and enabling the tokens to be traded and settled on a Delivery versus Payment basis – plus many other real-world examples.Says Kevin Johnson  the head of innovation competence centre at world settlement firm Euroclear “A Digital Assets Sandbox provides market participants with a safe environment where financial institutions and fintechs alike  can experiment and understand how the technology impacts operating and business models. It gives teams the ability to experiment  learn  and ultimately build a strong business case to invest in their digital asset strategies.”Don't Miss a Beat – Subscribe to get email alerts delivered directly to your inboxCheck Price ActionFollow us on X  Facebook and TelegramSurf The Daily Hodl MixDisclaimer: Opinions expressed at The Daily Hodl are not investment advice.

Moscow will launch legal proceedings against entities involved in the “theft” of some €260 billion ($282 billion) in Russian assets which remain frozen.,Lazy eyes listenNewsRescueKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has warned that Russia will retaliate against the West over its expropriation of the country’s sovereign assets.Moscow will launch legal proceedings against entities involved in the “theft” of some €260 billion ($282 billion) in Russian assets which remain frozen. Peskov made the pledge after the EU revealed that it will start sending the interest earned on this Russian money to Ukraine in the coming weeks.The European Union’s top diplomat Josep Borrell said on Monday that the first tranche of interest earned on the frozen funds  totaling some €1.4 billion ($1.5 billion)  will be sent to Kiev in the first week of August to fund arms purchases.“Such acts of thievery cannot remain without a response ” Peskov said on Tuesday  commenting on Borrell’s announcement.“This money is not only stolen  but also spent to buy weapons. It’s hard to imagine anything worse ” he argued  adding that tapping the funds would violate international law and property rights.The West froze nearly $300 billion in assets belonging to the Central Bank of Russia shortly after the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in 2022. Most of the immobilized funds are being held in the EU’s largest depositary and clearing house  Euroclear.In May  Brussels approved a plan to use the interest earned on the frozen assets to support Ukraine’s recovery and military defense. Under the agreement  90% of the proceeds are expected to go into an EU-run fund for Ukrainian military aid  with the other 10% to be allocated for supporting Kiev in other ways.Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova has also condemned the planned transfer of the funds and promised a “harsh” retaliation.“We have repeatedly said that we will respond very harshly ” she said on Tuesday. “Naturally  we will act in the national interests  and they will feel it  and I think they know it.”The Group of Seven nations  during their summit in Italy in June  also reached an agreement to use the interest earned on frozen Russian funds to finance a $50 billion loan to help Kiev buy arms and rebuild damaged infrastructure.Moscow has denounced the Western measures  emphasizing that military assistance to Kiev only prolongs the conflict.

Today  it released a statement saying its study as “demonstrated the feasibility of this project under satisfactory conditions.”Under the plan  each company would keep the “decision-making center of their activities  as well as their operational teams  in France.”Canal+  however  would be listed on the London Stock Exchange  which would “reflect the company’s international dimension” as it moves towards a deal to buy Africa’s MultiChoice.Vivendi noted “close to two thirds” of Canal+’s subscribers are outside of France  with other parts of Europe  Africa and Asia-Pacific driving growth. This would make London “an attractive solution for international investors.”Canal+ would remain incorporated and taxed in France and not be subject to mandatory stock market regs on public offers in either France or the UK. Furthermore  should its public tender offer for Showmax parent company MultiChoice be successful  a secondary listing on the Johannesburg stock market could follow.The move would leave Canal+  which houses pay-TV operations around the world and production division Studiocanal  with “virtually zero net debt ” besides the used for the MultiChoice deal. The Bolloré family that controls Vivendi would be left with a shareholding of around 30.6%.Havas  meanwhile  would be listed on the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange and a newly named company  Louis Hachette Group  would bring together Vivendi’s publishing assets on France’s Euronext Growth  with subsidiary Lagardère keeping its listing on the regulated Euronext Paris.Vivendi would still provide services to all three companies.No decision has been made as to whether the split will happen  but with Vivendi calling the plan “feasible” a decision to move ahead could come at the end of October ahead of an Extraordinary Shareholders’ Meeting in December.

Despite recent dividend increases to €0.71 per share  the payout is not well supported by earnings or free cash flows  indicating potential sustainability issues. Earnings growth is robust  projected at 25.2% annually over the next three years—outpacing the French market's average—though shareholder dilution has occurred within the last year.ENXTPA:ANTIN Discounted Cash Flow as at Jul 2024Overview: Edenred SE operates a global digital platform offering services and payments solutions for companies  employees  and merchants  with a market capitalization of approximately €10.28 billion.Operations: The company generates its revenue primarily from Business Services  which accounted for €2.31 billion.Story continuesEstimated Discount To Fair Value: 13.5%Edenred  valued at €41.29  is considered undervalued with a fair value estimate of €47.71  reflecting a modest potential for price appreciation. The company is expected to see significant earnings growth at 20.15% annually over the next three years  surpassing the French market's forecast of 10.9%. However  it carries a high level of debt and its dividend coverage by earnings is weak.

Despite a decline in net profit margins from 53.2% to 35.2%  the company's revenue and earnings are expected to grow by 20.1% and 31.3% annually  respectively—both rates exceeding market averages significantly. However  its dividends are poorly covered by free cash flows  and forecasted Return on Equity is low at 12.6%.

It would change its name to Louis Hachette Group.Canal+ and Havas would have virtually zero net debt  the company also noted on Monday.Growth at acquired publisher Lagardère  as well as Canal+ and Havas helped drive first-quarter revenue at the French media and telecommunications conglomerate  which is led by chairman Yannick Bolloré and CEO Arnaud de Puyfontaine. “Vivendi has endured a significantly high conglomerate discount  substantially reducing its valuation and thereby limiting its ability to carry out external growth transactions for its subsidiaries ” the firm said earlier in the year in explaining the plan for a split.The rest of Vivendi would continue to operate and be listed on the Euronext Paris market. “Vivendi would continue to develop and transform [video gaming firm] Gameloft and actively manage a portfolio of investments (foremost among them being Universal Music Group) in sectors perfectly familiar to its teams for many years  while having the means and ambition to initiate new investments in related activities ” the company said on Monday. “Vivendi would also retain the minority interest it could acquire in Lagardère SA through the exercise of the transfer rights issued as part of the 2022 public tender offer  which remain exercisable until June 15  2025. Vivendi would also provide a certain number of services to the three listed companies resulting from the split.”,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,neutral,0.03,0.92,0.04,True,English,"['Vivendi Eyes Canal+ Stock Market Listing', 'Split Into Four Companies', 'London', 'Part', 'South African pay-TV giant MultiChoice', 'TV series distribution network', 'CEO Arnaud de Puyfontaine', 'mandatory stock market regulations', 'Canal+ Group pay-TV unit', 'Johannesburg stock market', 'zero net debt', 'chairman Yannick Bolloré', 'stock market listing', 'Louis Hachette Group', 'Universal Music Group', 'public tender offer', 'high conglomerate discount', 'three listed companies', 'publisher Lagardère', 'Lagardère SA', 'London Stock Exchange', 'Euronext Growth exchange', 'external growth transactions', 'Euronext Amsterdam market', 'Euronext Paris market', 'media giant', 'African, European', 'public offers', 'four companies', 'telecommunications conglomerate', 'London-based listing', 'secondary listing', 'growth drivers', 'French telecom', 'international dimension', 'ongoing combination', 'recent developments', 'Asia-Pacific markets', 'attractive solution', 'international investors', 'United Kingdom', 'majority stake', 'Prisma Media', 'first-quarter revenue', 'French media', 'many years', 'related activities', 'minority interest', 'transfer rights', 'advertising business', 'new investments', 'Vivendi', 'Monday', 'update', 'study', 'company', 'part', 'two-thirds', 'subscribers', 'France', 'film', 'continents', 'addition', 'success', 'Havas', 'name', 'valuation', 'ability', 'subsidiaries', 'firm', 'plan', 'split', 'Gameloft', 'portfolio', 'sectors', 'teams', 'means', 'ambition', 'exercise', 'June', 'number', 'services']",2024-07-22,2024-07-23,hollywoodreporter.com

The project will help generate additional data to potentially support extended IXCHIQ® labels in chikungunya- endemic countries and vulnerable populations at risk of being infected with this debilitating mosquito-borne disease.Several thousand participants are set to take part in the planned trials  due to start in 2025. The research will include assessment of the vaccine in children aged 1-11 and pregnant women in countries that may be affected by a chikungunya outbreak. Some trials are planned to be conducted in Brazil  which is currently facing a significant chikungunya outbreak with over 340 000 cases reported so far this year.The expanded partnership strengthens an earlier agreement1 which awarded Valneva U.S. $24.6 million in CEPI-EU funding to develop  manufacture  and market its single-shot vaccine in certain LMICs affected by chikungunya. Under this initial agreement  Valneva partnered with Brazil’s Instituto Butantan (IB) in 2021 and conducted an adolescent clinical trial in Brazil to support licensure of the vaccine in this country  which would be the first potential approval for use in endemic populations  as well as label extension in this age group in the U.S. and other territories. Review of the marketing authorization application for IXCHIQ® by the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency (ANVISA) is ongoing with potential approval in 2024. IB is committed to providing the chikungunya vaccine it will develop and produce in Brazil at an affordable price for distribution in Latin American countries and selected LMICs.CEPI-EU funding will also support technology transfer of the vaccine drug product to an additional vaccine manufacturer to accelerate and expand access to IXCHIQ® in Asian LMICs that are vulnerable to chikungunya outbreaks.Dr Richard Hatchett  Chief Executive Officer of CEPI  said  “Millions of people have been affected by chikungunya and  today  over a billion people live in areas where chikungunya outbreaks occur. Access to an affordable chikungunya vaccine in areas where the burden of disease is the greatest is a joint priority for CEPI  Valneva and our European Union partners. These clinical studies and tech transfer to an additional endemic-region manufacturer will accelerate endemic country access  inform future vaccine rollout strategies and alleviate the burden of future chikungunya outbreaks.”Thomas Lingelbach  Chief Executive Officer of Valneva  said  “We are extremely pleased to strengthen our partnership with CEPI. Chikungunya infection is a major unmet medical need  and we believe that our single-dose vaccine is uniquely positioned to help protect people living in areas where chikungunya occurs and for travelers to these regions. With climate change  more areas across the world are becoming habitable for the mosquito vectors that transmit the virus  thereby increasing the size of the human population at risk of infection.”Esper Kallás  Director of Instituto Butantan  said  “Arboviruses have become an increasing concern worldwide  due to climate change  which favors the adaptation of mosquitoes in other environments. This is highly relevant  and Butantan's effort to codevelop the chikungunya vaccine aligns with our mission to address public health problems not only in Brazil but worldwide.”The European Commission’s Laurent Muschel  Head of HERA  and Irene Norstedt  Director at DG Research and Innovation  said “Access to medical countermeasures for the most vulnerable  such as the vaccine against Chikungunya  is a key priority for the EU when it comes to health emergency preparedness and response. €38 million have been mobilised under Horizon Europe  the Union’s funding programme for research  in partnership with CEPI  to support clinical studies on the effectiveness of Valneva’s new vaccine in low- and middle-income countries. Such vaccine  authorised in the EU since last month  also strongly contributes to improving preparedness against vector-borne diseases  that due to climate change  may expand to non-endemic regions such as the EU. Support for research is essential and the EU remains committed to strengthening global health.”IXCHIQ® was granted approval in the U.S. in November 20232 and in Canada and Europe in June 20243 4. Regulatory reviews for IXCHIQ® are ongoing in Brazil and the United Kingdom.—ENDS—About the trialsPending approvals  the new chikungunya vaccine trials will evaluate:Effectiveness of IXCHIQ® in Brazil – Part-funded by CEPI and the EU’s Horizon Europe program  as part of a larger development program with over 120 000 participants assessing chikungunya in vaccinated and unvaccinated populations  as a measure of vaccine effectiveness Efficacy of IXCHIQ® in an outbreak setting in a LMIC – Part- funded by CEPI and the EU’s Horizon Europe program as part of a trial in 20 000 participants to determine vaccine efficacy in a randomised-controlled trial outside of Brazil Safety and immunogenicity of IXCHIQ® in pregnant women in Brazil Optimal IXCHIQ® doses in children aged 1-11 in a low- and middle-income country in Latin America Safety and immunogenicity of IXCHIQ® in children aged 1-11 in a LMIC  potentially located in AsiaTrial partners  including clinical research organisations and trial sponsors  are expected to be selected over the coming months.About ChikungunyaChikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a mosquito-borne viral disease spread by the bites of infected Aedes mosquitoes which causes fever  severe joint pain  muscle pain  headache  nausea  fatigue and rash. Joint pain is often debilitating and can persist for weeks to years.5In 2004  the disease began to spread quickly  causing large-scale outbreaks around the world. Since the re-emergence of the virus  CHIKV has now been identified in over 110 countries in Asia  Africa  Europe and the Americas.6 Between 2013 and 2023  more than 3.7 million cases were reported in the Americas7 and the economic impact is considered to be significant. The medical and economic burden is expected to grow with climate change as the mosquito vectors that transmit the disease continue to spread geographically. As such  the World Health Organization (WHO) has highlighted chikungunya as a major public health risk.8About CEPICEPI was launched in 2017 as an innovative partnership between public  private  philanthropic and civil organizations. Its mission is to accelerate the development of vaccines and other biologic countermeasures against epidemic and pandemic threats so they can be accessible to all people in need. CEPI has supported the development of more than 50 vaccine candidates or platform technologies against multiple known high-risk pathogens or a future Disease X. Central to CEPI’s pandemic-beating five-year plan for 2022-2026 is the ‘100 Days Mission’ to compress the time taken to develop safe  effective  globally accessible vaccines against new threats to just 100 days.Learn more at CEPI.net.

Following the split  the Bolloré Group would hold about 30.6% of the shares of Canal+  Louis Hachette Group and Havas respectively. Because of the voting rights structure in Havas  Bolloré Group will have more than 40% of the voting rights.Bolloré is often dubbed the “French Murdoch” after building out a powerful media empire that spans broadcast  cinema  publishing  music  cinema and gaming. The plan to break up the business marks a shift away from France as the mogul pushes to internationalize his media assets.Vivendi said the feasibility study for its split plan favored London for Canal+ “to reflect the company’s international dimension ” confirming an earlier Bloomberg News report. The pay-TV unit  which is in the process of buying MultiChoice Group Ltd. in Africa  counts two-thirds of its subscribers outside of France. Still  the business will remain incorporated and taxed in its home country.A Dutch listing for ad agency Havas is the “best possible position to carry out its new global strategy ” Vivendi said. The new Louis Hachette Group would be listed in Paris on Euronext Growth  and include the world’s third-largest book publisher  Hachette  as well as the media arm that the Bolloré family has been expanding through acquisitions.All three of the newly split-off companies will keep their “decision-making center” and operational teams in France  Vivendi said. The remaining Vivendi business would remain listed in Paris and manage the firm’s investments in Universal Music Group and Telecom Italia  as well as smaller video game company Gameloft.Vivendi said it was weighing a breakup in December to boost its share price  and said it was suffering from a “conglomerate discount” that was limiting its subsidiaries’ ability to grow. It was a reversal for Bolloré  who’d tried to create synergies between the group’s activities  turning intellectual property such as Paddington Bear into films  books and marketing campaigns in an effort to build a European empire to rival Netflix Inc. and Walt Disney Co.A decision could be made at the end of October and voted on by shareholders in December  Vivendi said. The split needs investors holding at least two-thirds of Vivendi’s shares to approve the deal before it goes ahead.“If we were to go ahead  we will need to convince all the shareholders ” Havas Chief Executive Officer Yannick Bolloré  who is Vincent’s son  told Bloomberg in June. “Our peers are listed  so we know investors that are interested in this sector.”,neutral,0.1,0.89,0.02,positive,0.59,0.41,0.0,True,English,"['French billionaire Vincent Bolloré', 'media giant Vivendi', 'Boost', 'London', 'Amsterdam', 'listings', 'Europe', 'Chief Executive Officer Yannick Bolloré', 'earlier Bloomberg News report', 'smaller video game company', 'new Louis Hachette Group', 'French billionaire Vincent Bolloré', 'best possible position', 'new global strategy', 'largest book publisher', 'Walt Disney Co', 'MultiChoice Group Ltd.', 'London Stock Exchange', 'voting rights structure', 'Universal Music Group', 'powerful media empire', 'Havas advertising agency', 'Canal+ broadcasting business', 'remaining Vivendi business', 'Bolloré Group', 'new company', 'ad agency', 'Bolloré family', 'entertainment empire', 'European empire', 'sprawling media', 'media assets', 'media arm', 'distribution assets', 'feasibility study', 'international dimension', 'pay-TV unit', 'home country', 'Dutch listing', 'Euronext Growth', 'decision-making center', 'operational teams', 'Telecom Italia', 'share price', 'conglomerate discount', 'subsidiaries’ ability', 'intellectual property', 'Paddington Bear', 'marketing campaigns', 'Netflix Inc.', 'Vivendi SE', 'Amsterdam', 'plans', 'publishing', 'Paris', 'statement', 'Monday', 'split', 'shares', 'cinema', 'gaming', 'shift', 'France', 'mogul', 'process', 'Africa', 'two-thirds', 'subscribers', 'world', 'acquisitions', 'firm', 'investments', 'Gameloft', 'breakup', 'December', 'reversal', 'synergies', 'activities', 'films', 'books', 'effort', 'October', 'shareholders', 'investors', 'deal', 'son', 'June', 'peers', 'sector']",2024-07-22,2024-07-23,fortune.com

44000,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.investing.com/news/press-releases/vivendi-update-on-the-groups-split-project-93CH-3528214,Vivendi: Update on the Group's Split Project By Investing.com,Vivendi: Update on the Group's Split Project,PARIS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Regulatory News:Vivendi (OTC: )'s (Paris:VIV) Management Board today presented to the Supervisory Board an update on the feasibility study of the split project announced on December 13  2023.As a reminder  since the distribution and listing of Universal Music Group (AS: ) in 2021  Vivendi has endured a significantly high conglomerate discount  substantially reducing its valuation and thereby limiting its ability to carry out external growth transactions for its subsidiaries. Canal+  Havas and LagardÃ¨re are currently experiencing strong growth in an international context marked by numerous investment opportunities. To fully unleash the development potential of all its activities  in December 2023  Vivendi initiated the feasibility study of a split project where Canal+  Havas and a company grouping the assets in publishing and distribution would become independent entities listed on the stock market.To date  the study has demonstrated the feasibility of this project under satisfactory conditions and identified the most suitable stock exchanges for these three companies once separated from Vivendi  considering the nature of their activities and their international exposure.All three of these companies would keep the decision-making center of their activities  as well as their operational teams  in France: Canal+ and Havas  although listed outside of France  would remain French tax residents for French corporate income tax purposes.Canal+ would be listed on the London Stock Exchange to reflect the company's international dimension  particularly as part of the ongoing combination with MultiChoice. With close to two thirds of its subscribers outside of France  a film and TV series distribution network present on all continents  and growth drivers resulting from its recent developments on the African  European and Asia-Pacific markets  a London-based listing would represent an attractive solution for international investors likely to be interested in the group. Canal+ would remain a company incorporated and taxed in France and would not be subject to mandatory stock market regulations on public offers in either the United Kingdom or France. Furthermore  Canal+  depending on the success of its public tender offer for MultiChoice  could be subject to a secondary listing on the Johannesburg stock market.Havas  with the majority of its activities being carried out internationally  would be listed as a Dutch public limited liability company (NV) on the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange  which already witnessed UMG's success. Havas NV would be subject to Dutch stock market regulations and adhere to the Dutch Corporate Governance Code. As a result  Havas would be in the best possible position to carry out its new global strategy  Converged  continue its solid growth as well as its strong commercial and creative momentum  and stabilize its share capital  ensuring its sustainability for its talents and clients. To this end  a Dutch legal foundation would guarantee the preservation of the group's independence and identity  and multiple voting rights  initially double after two years of holding  then quadruple two years later  would be offered to long term committed shareholders  taking into account the length of time the Vivendi shares were held for the double voting rights.A newly named company  Louis Hachette Group1  would bring together the assets owned by Vivendi in publishing and distribution  i.e.  the Group's 63.5% shareholding today inLagardÃ¨re SA and 100% of Prisma Media. This company would be listed on Euronext Growth in Paris  consistent with the continued listing of its subsidiary LagardÃ¨re SA on the regulated market of Euronext Paris.In this configuration  Vivendi would remain a leading player within the creative and entertainment industries  listed on the regulated market of Euronext Paris. Vivendi would continue to develop and transform Gameloft and actively manage a portfolio of investments (foremost among them being UMG) in sectors perfectly familiar to its teams for many years  while having the means and ambition to initiate new investments in related activities. Vivendi would also retain the minority interest it could acquire in LagardÃ¨re SA through the exercise of the transfer rights issued as part of the 2022 public tender offer  which remain exercisable until June 15  2025. Vivendi would also provide a certain number of services to the three listed companies resulting from the split.Tax issues related to this project are still being studied.The procedures for informing and consulting the employee representative bodies of the concerned Group entities will now be initiated on this project. It is reminded that at this stage  and according to applicable law  no decision to carry out this project has been  or can be  taken  and that no further action  even potential  can be presumed with regard to this project.In parallel with the procedures for informing and consulting the employee representative bodies  a number of discussions will be organized with tax and regulatory authorities  including stock exchange regulators.If this project were to proceed following the information and consultation procedure  a decision could be taken at the end of October 2024 with the aim of submitting it to an Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting which could be held in December 2024. This transaction would therefore only be carried out if it were to be approved  during this Shareholders' Meeting  by a two-thirds majority of the shareholders. To date  no regulatory authorizations have been identified as being required for this project to be executed.In line with the strategic plan aimed at enabling the Group's different businesses to seize investment opportunities in future  post-split  Canal+ and Havas would have virtually zero net debt  with the exception of the debt put in place by Canal+ for the MultiChoice public tender offer. Louis Hachette Group would have no debt of its own except for LagardÃ¨re's net debt of approximately €2 billion which has recently been refinanced. Following the split  Vivendi could have a net debt of around €1.5 to €2 billion.If approved by the Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting  the allocation of the shares in the various companies concerned to Vivendi's shareholders and their listing on the stock market  are expected to take place in the days following such meeting2.Following the allocation of the shares of the entities resulting from the split  the BollorÃ© group would hold approximately 30.6% of the share capital and voting rights of Canal+ and Louis Hachette Group. It would hold approximately 30.6% of the share capital of Havas NV and could  due to the double voting rights  hold over 40% of the voting rights. The implementation of this project is not expected to lead to the launching of a public tender offer for Vivendi or for any of its separated entities. The contribution of the majority stake of LagardÃ¨re SA's share capital to Louis Hachette Group will be the subject of a request to the AMF for an exemption from the mandatory public tender offer requirement  based on a rationale specific to a split transaction.About VivendiSince 2014  Vivendi has been building a world-class content  media and communications group. Canal+ Group is a major player in the creation and distribution of cinema and audiovisual content on all continents. With LagardÃ¨re  Vivendi is the world's third-largest book publisher for the general public and educational markets  and a leading global player in travel retail. Havas is one of the largest global communications groups with a presence in more than 100 countries. Vivendi is also active in the magazine business (Prisma Media)  and in video games (Gameloft). It also owns a global digital content distribution platform (Dailymotion) and a subsidiary dedicated to providing very high-speed Internet access in Africa (GVA). Vivendi's various activities work closely together as an integrated group committed to transforming its businesses to meet the expectations of the public and anticipate constant changes. As a committed group  Vivendi contributes to building more open  inclusive  and responsible societies by supporting diverse and inventive creative works  promoting broader access to culture  education  and its industries  and increasing awareness of 21st century challenges and opportunities. www.vivendi.com.Important disclaimersThis press release contains forward -looking statements with respect to Vivendi's financial condition  results of operations  business  strategy  plans and outlook  including the impact of certain transactions such as the split and listing projects  as well as related operations.

The growth rate for H1 2024 vs H1 2023 is impacted by the base effect linked to the strong growth in H1 2023 vs H1 2022 (+16%). Business in H1 2024 was impacted by an occasional delay in orders in Asia (distributors and end customers). The first six months of 2024 were very buoyant  with numerous development opportunities. The Group is maintaining its revenue growth target for 2024 and anticipates an improvement in profitability compared with the 17% EBITDA margin achieved in 2023  despite the impact of of H1 2024 revenue on profitability for the period.Consolidated revenues (unaudited)Revenues (€m) 2024 2023 Reported change Change at constant scope and exch rates1st quarter 43.9 40.9 +7% +5% 2nd quarter 54.1 56.3 +1% -2% 1st half 98.0 97.2 +1% -2% of which Photonics 47.2 45.9 +3% -4% Medical 50.8 51.3 -1% 0%At 30 June 2024  Lumibird's consolidated revenues came to 98.0 million euros  up 1% on a reported basis  up 2% at constant exchange rates and down 2% on a like-for-like basis (restated for Convergent revenues included in the scope of consolidation at 31.08.23). This compares with a particularly dynamic first half of 2023  which saw revenues rise by 16% on a reported basis and by 17% on a like-for-like basis.By market segmentThe Photonics division grew by 3% thanks to the integration of Lumibird Italy (Convergent). On a like-for-like basis  revenues were down 4%. The base effect is all the more significant given that growth in H1 2023 vs H1 2022 was +19%.The first business segment  Defense/Space  with revenues of €20.6m  is up +23.2% on H1 2023  supported by strong demand and multi-year contracts.The Industrial and Scientific segment  which has been restated for the MedTech business  posted H1 revenues of €12.0m  Down 9%  against a backdrop of reduced demand across customer distribution channels.MedTech activities  which were formerly included in the Industrial and Scientific segment  are gaining in importance  thanks in particular to the integration of Lumibird Italy's activities. MedTech revenues came to €7.5 million in H1  including €3.8 million contributed by Lumibird Italy  compared with €1.8 million in H1 2023. Innovation is driving growth  due to the increasingly widespread use of laser technology in numerous medtech applications (diagnostics  treatments  measurement and activation of pharmaceutical molecules and biological analyses)..The Environment  Topography  Safety segment (formerly Lidar) recorded sales of €7.0m  compared with €14.1m in H1 2023. The base effect is all the more significant given that growth in H1 2023 vs H1 2022 was +29%. Applications sales fell  mainly in Safety applications  with the gradual postponement of applications for autonomous vehicles as carmakers transferred to electric cars their investments in the development of their ranges. Topography applications are seeing demand for a new generation of products - higher performance and lower cost - for which Lumibird is very well positioned with its breakthrough fibre laser technologies. Deliveries of lasers for environmental applications (wind turbines and 3D scanning) remain solid  but are experiencing a decline over time as customers reduce stocks. The implementation of a new sales organisation for environmental Lidar systems  to accelerate development in high-potential niche segments such as firefighting  and the imminent arrival of new-generation systems  had an impact on sales in H1 2024. The ramp-up of this new organization will enable to accelerate the development of systems business from the second half of 2024.The Medical Division  which focuses on the ophthalmology market  recorded revenues of €50.8 million in the first half  down slightly (-1%) on the previous year  and up 0.4% at constant exchange rates  with adverse currency effects in US dollars  yen and Swedish krona. The first half was marked by a slower-than-expected recovery in Asian markets  mainly China and Korea. The regulatory and administrative obstacles identified at the end of 2023 are gradually being overcome  for example with the CE mark for C-SUITE (dry eye) being obtained in May 2024.The breakdown of H1 sales is 21% (24% in 2023) for diagnostic equipment and 79% (76% in 2023) for laser treatment products.By geographyThe breakdown of H1 revenues by division and by geographical area is as follows:H1 revenues (€m) Photonics Change/ 2023 Medical Change/ 2023 EMEA 27.9 +19% 17.4 +2% Americas 6.7 -19% 14.1 +3% APAC 7.6 -32% 13.8 -10% Rest of the world 5.0 +77% 5.6 +11% Total 47.2 +3% 50.8 -1%Unaudited dataThe Photonics divisions strong growth in Europe was driven by its activity in Defense and Space and MedTech markets whilst the decline in the Americas and APAC was primarily driven by Environment  Topography and Safety market applications and systems.The Medical division saw growth in Europe and Americas led by laser treatment products. Asia Pacific  however continued to be impacted by administrative blockages in China and a reduction of stock in distributor channels impacting the diagnostic equipment market to a greater extent.OutlookThe Group has a solid order book  which should be further strengthened by the signing of new multi-year contracts  particularly in the defense sector.Lumibird published its 2024-2026 plan in May 2024  confirming the following objectives for the period to 2026:an average annual growth rate (CAGR) in sales greater than 8%. This growth will be achieved through continued innovation  new product releases and a commitment to deliver multi-year contracts on-time in dynamic markets.an EBITDA margin that is at least 500 basis points higher than in 2023. This EBITDA margin improvement will be achieved by leveraging the Group's verticalisation strategy  increasing productivity and optimising the organisational structure thanks to recent investments.The Group expects its profitability to improve in 2024 from the 17% EBITDA/Sales margin achieved in 2023  although the EBITDA margin expected in the first half of 2024 will be impacted by the level of Sales for the period.Next date: H1 2024 results  24/09/2024 after close of tradingLUMIBIRD is one of the world's leading laser specialists.

(Euronext Growth Paris: AL™E)  a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing novel therapies for treatment of cancer by targeting the tumor microenvironment (™E)  announces its plan to externalize and monetize the company's second clinical stage asset NOX-E36 “ an L-stereoisomer RNA aptamer inhibiting the CCL2 chemokine. This decision leverages the compound's potential  as shown by clinical and preclinical data  to safely address significant unmet medical needs in ophthalmic diseases impacted by fibrosis.The presence of the target of NOX-E36  CCL2  has been shown to predict early failure of glaucoma surgical intervention in patients and inhibition of the pathway targeted by NOX-E36 in preclinical models of glaucoma surgery prevents fibrosis thereby prolonging the success of the intervention1. NOX-E36 has already been administered to 175 clinical trial participants with an excellent safety and tolerability profile and showing activity on its target  already derisking a number of steps in early clinical development.Fibrosis is a significant cause of treatment failure or increased severity in many clinically important eye diseases2 with unmet needs such as diabetic retinopathy (9.6 million cases in the US  of which 1.84 million vision-threatening3)  age-related macular degeneration (20 million cases in the US  of which 1.5 million vision-threatening4)  and primary open angle glaucoma (>3 million cases in the US5).""Our discussions with glaucoma clinicians revealed there is an unmet need for well-tolerated therapies with an anti-fibrotic effect to safely reduce scarring following eye surgery and provide patients with long-term benefit and that this indication could provide a rapid path to regulatory approval "" said Aram Mangasarian  CEO of ™E Pharma. ""We have already established NOX-E36's activity on its biological target and demonstrated its excellent safety and tolerability profile in patients  offering us a promising opportunity for rapid advancement in the ophthalmology space and an upside potential for the company's valuation. Since we have sufficient drug supply for initial clinical trials  we are currently working with ophthalmology experts to lay the framework to generate proof-of-concept clinical data at limited cost for the company that could unlock significant business opportunities. Given the successful track record of two other RNA aptamers being approved for use in ophthalmology and the substantial partnerships formed in this space such as the $5.9 billion Astellas acquisition of Iveric primarily for the RNA aptamer now known as Izervay6  we are confident in NOX-E36's potential to attract interest. While ™E Pharma will continue its focus on oncology  our goal is to create a new entity with full rights to develop NOX-E36 in ophthalmology supported by private investors. We expect to provide updates on these activities before the end of this year.""About ™E Pharma™E Pharma is a clinical-stage company focused on developing novel therapies for treatment of the most aggressive cancers. The company's oncology-focused pipeline is designed to act on the tumor microenvironment (™E) and the cancer immunity cycle by breaking tumor protection barriers against the immune system and blocking tumor repair. By neutralizing chemokines in the ™E  ™E Pharma's approach works in combination with other forms of treatment to weaken tumor defenses and enable greater therapeutic impact. In the GLORIA Phase 1/2 clinical trial  ™E Pharma is studying its lead drug candidate NOX-A12 in newly diagnosed brain cancer patients who will not benefit clinically from standard chemotherapy. ™E Pharma has delivered top-line data from the NOX-A12 three dose-escalation cohorts combined with radiotherapy of the GLORIA clinical trial  observing consistent tumor reductions and objective tumor responses. Additionally  GLORIA expansion arms evaluate safety and efficacy of NOX-A12 in other combinations where the interim results from the triple combination of NOX-A12  radiotherapy and bevacizumab suggest even deeper and more durable responses  and improved survival. US FDA has approved the design of a randomized Phase 2 trial in glioblastoma and ™E Pharma was awarded fast track designation by the FDA for NOX-A12 in combination with radiotherapy and bevacizumab for use in the treatment of the aggressive adult brain cancer  glioblastoma. NOX-A12 in combination with radiotherapy had also previously received orphan drug designation (ODD) for glioblastoma in the United States and glioma in Europe. ™E Pharma has delivered final top-line data with encouraging overall survival and safety profile from its NOX-A12 combination trial with Keytruda ® in metastatic colorectal and pancreatic cancer patients  which was published in the Journal for ImmunoTherapy of Cancer in October 2021. The company has entered in its second collaboration with MSD/Merck for its Phase 2 study  OPTIMUS  to further evaluate safety and efficacy of NOX-A12 in combination with Merck's Keytruda ® and two different chemotherapy regimens as second-line therapy in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. The design of the trial has been approved in France  Spain and the United States. The company's second clinical-stage drug candidate  NOX-E36  is designed to target the innate immune system. ™E Pharma is considering several solid tumors for further clinical development.

GLORIA further evaluates safety and efficacy of NOX-A12 three additional arms combining NOX-A12 with: A. radiotherapy in patients with complete tumor resection; B. radiotherapy and bevacizumab; and C. radiotherapy and pembrolizumab.About the OPTIMUS StudyOPTIMUS (NCT04901741) is ™E Pharma's planned open-label two-arm Phase 2 study of NOX-A12 combined with pembrolizumab and nanoliposomal irinotecan/5-FU/leucovorin or gemcitabine/nab-paclitaxel in microsatellite-stable metastatic pancreatic cancer patients.DisclaimerTranslations of any press release into languages other than English are intended solely as a convenience to the non-English-reading audience.
