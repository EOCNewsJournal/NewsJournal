Its dividends  only distributed for the past 8 years  have been unstable and unreliable with significant annual fluctuations exceeding 20%. However  its payout ratio remains modest at 47.9%  suggesting earnings adequately cover dividends currently and are projected to remain so over the next three years. Recent strategic moves include expanding into Germany's wealth management sector through acquisitions  potentially influencing future financial stability and dividend capacity.ENXTAM:ABN Dividend History as at Jul 2024Simply Wall St Dividend Rating: ★★★★☆☆Overview: Koninklijke KPN N.V. is a telecommunications and IT service provider in the Netherlands  with a market capitalization of approximately €14.79 billion.Operations: Koninklijke KPN N.V. generates revenue through three primary segments: Business (€1.84 billion)  Consumer (€2.93 billion)  and Wholesale (€0.70 billion).Dividend Yield: 4%Koninklijke KPN has demonstrated a mix of strategic initiatives and financial transactions that underscore its complex position as a dividend stock. Recently  KPN engaged in significant business expansions  notably acquiring 5G spectrum licenses for €58.4 million and forming TowerCo with ABP  enhancing its infrastructure capabilities. Despite these growth efforts  the company's dividends have shown volatility over the past decade with an unstable track record. Financially  while KPN's dividends are covered by both earnings and cash flows with payout ratios of 78.4% and 59.6% respectively  its overall debt level remains high which could influence future sustainability and reliability of dividend payments.Story continuesENXTAM:KPN Dividend History as at Jul 2024Simply Wall St Dividend Rating: ★★★★☆☆Overview: Van Lanschot Kempen NV is a financial services provider operating both in the Netherlands and internationally  with a market capitalization of approximately €1.72 billion.Operations: Van Lanschot Kempen NV generates revenue through its Investment Banking Clients and Wholesale & Institutional Clients segments  contributing €41 million and €83.10 million respectively.Dividend Yield: 9.8%Van Lanschot Kempen  with a dividend yield of 9.82%  ranks in the top 25% of Dutch dividend payers.

However  earnings have grown by 81.8% over the past year and dividends are well-covered by earnings with a payout ratio of 70.9%. Recently  VLK completed a share buyback program for €22.66 million which may reflect positively on shareholder value but does not directly impact dividend payments.ENXTAM:VLK Dividend History as at Jul 2024Summing It All UpClick this link to deep-dive into the 7 companies within our Top Euronext Amsterdam Dividend Stocks screener.Already own these companies?

Refer to Annex 3 for a reconciliation of non-IFRS performance measures.New orders of €755 million in Q2 2024 increased by 56% at constant currencies (increased by 55% as reported) mainly driven by strong demand for gate-all-around (GAA) and high-bandwith memory (HBM).Revenue of €706 million increased by 6% at constant currencies (also 6% as reported) from Q2 of last year and slightly above the guidance (€660-700 million).Adjusted gross profit margin increased to 49.8%  up from 49.0% in Q2 of last year  due to mix and strong China sales.Adjusted operating result margin decreased to 25.8%  compared to 26.9% in Q2 last year. The margin % was unfavorably impacted by 1.2% as a result of a one-off tax charge related to accelerated vesting of previously granted performance shares.Revenue for Q3 2024 is projected to increase to €740-780 million. Revenue for the second half is expected to increase around 15% compared to the first half.In Q2 2024 we paid €135 million in dividends to ASM shareholders and bought back €59 million of our own shares as part of €150 million share buyback program that started on May 15  2024.Comment“ASM continued its solid performance in the second quarter”  said Hichem M’Saad  CEO of ASM. “Revenue in the second quarter amounted to €706 million  which was an increase of 6% at constant currencies compared to the same quarter of last year  and slightly above the top end of our guidance of €660-700 million.Bookings increased to €755 million  up 56% at constant currencies from the second quarter 2023. Logic/foundry bookings again included a solid level of tool orders related to the gate-all-around (GAA) 2nm technology node. The GAA node is still projected to move into high-volume manufacturing in the course of 2025  and we expect this to be a strong revenue driver for ASM.Also  in memory  we saw strong growth in bookings benefiting from investments in DRAM HBM applications.In the silicon-based power/analog/wafer segment  bookings were at a decent level  despite the generally slow demand in this market. Silicon carbide (SiC) Epi bookings were also at a relatively strong level in Q2.Q2 adjusted gross margin increased from 49.0% last year to 49.8%. It decreased compared to the exceptional level of 52.9% in Q1 2024  which is explained by mix and lower sales from China. The adjusted operating profit margin decreased slightly to 25.8% in Q2 2024 compared to 26.9% in the same quarter last year  and would have been 27.0% excluding approximately 1.2% from a one-off tax charge included in SG&A expenses in Q2 2024.”OutlookWhile conditions in end markets continue to be mixed  the recovery of the wafer fab equipment is gradually picking up pace  as AI demand is fueling investments in HBM DRAM and in leading-edge logic/foundry. For 2024  a slight increase in WFE spending is expected  followed by a stronger increase in 2025.We expect revenue in the third quarter of 2024  at constant currencies  to be in a range of €740-780 million.We project ASM’s revenue in the second half to increase around 15% compared to the level in the first half resulting in another growth year for ASM. We continue to expect sales from China to drop in the second half compared to the exceptional level in the first half. This will however be more than offset by an expected strong increase in the second half in leading-edge logic/foundry sales  mostly driven by rising GAA-related sales and an increase in memory sales  in particular for HBM DRAM.Despite softening market conditions  we still expect our silicon carbide (SiC) Epi sales to increase by a double-digit percentage in 2024  supported by the contribution from newly won customers.We remain confident about the mid-term targets for 2025 and 2027 that we provided in our 2023 Investor Day  and we expect ASM will continue to outperform the WFE market during this timeframe.Interim financial reportASM International N.V.

The pants are designed to reduce the psychological impact of incontinence during adolescence  offering protection and discretion.“Children growing up during the Covid years already had a tough time socializing  and the children who struggle with bladder control need extra support for social interactions. We design the pants so children with incontinence can join social activities like sleepovers and school trips  and enjoy everyday life "" said Annick De Poorter   Chief Innovation and Sustainability Officer.The new Ontex youth pants are tailored for children aged 3 to 15 who struggle with bladder control at night  despite staying dry during the day  or have some disability leading to loss of bladder control.The pants are produced by Ontex plants using its growing HappyFit product platform and will be available through retailers and Ontex’s online sales channels in Europe  with room for expansion to other regions.

The award recognised EETA for an outstanding achievement in commissioning and accrediting a state-of-the-art microplastics laboratory.The Excellence Award  a new annual accolade  celebrates NATA Member organisations that demonstrate exceptional quality  innovation  competency  and technical excellence in their accredited services. This award recognises the Melbourne based EETA microplastics laboratory for its enhanced quality and reliability  and how it contributes to the advancement of science through global collaboration efforts related to microplastics analysis techniques.The ubiquitous presence of plastic in our environment has led to a staggering global production of approximately 8.3 billion metric tons since 1950. Inadequate management and recycling practices have contributed to environmental pollution from microplastics  posing risks to both human health and ecosystems. In response to these challenges  legislation on microplastics is evolving globally  prompting bans on certain plastic products and the establishment of monitoring programmes. Microplastics analysis remains complex due to limited standard methods and varying instrumentation which hinders data comparability. Inadequate quality control measures and a lack of reference materials in many laboratories further complicate the issue.In response to the global challenge that microplastics pose  Eurofins Environment Testing Australia established a dedicated commercial microplastics laboratory in 2019  with a focus on pioneering and advancing methodologies. Eurofins Environment Testing Australia (EETA) is ISO/IEC 17025 accredited for microplastics testing in potable water  as of 2023  becoming one of the first accredited laboratories for microplastics analysis in the Southern Hemisphere. The Eurofins network of laboratories offers an extensive global commercial microplastic testing service offering  and the Australian laboratory is one of five dedicated microplastic laboratories within the network.About Eurofins Environment Testing in AustraliaEurofins Environment Testing Australia offers testing and monitoring services across Australia from 7 laboratories and 5 service centres.

In addition  the exemption from the mandatory filing of a tender offer by Sopra GMT for the Company's share capital was granted by the AutoritÃ© des marchÃ©s financiers (the AMF) on June 4  2024  under the number 224C0810.Completion of the acquisition is expected in early September 2024.Patrick Donovan  Axway's Chief Executive Officer  said:""With the launch of its capital increase  Axway is taking a new step in the acquisition of Sopra Banking Software announced last February. We are giving birth to one of France's top enterprise software publishers  with unique positions in banking and financial services. The acquisition of Sopra Banking Software represents a major leap forward in our development  and is a perfect illustration of our external growth ambitions. Beyond the change in dimension  I am proud of our success in building an alliance project that creates value for all our stakeholders  with meaningful levers for our customers  employees and shareholders alike.""Rationale of the issue and use of proceedsThe net proceeds of the capital increase will be used to finance part of the purchase price1 of Sopra Banking Software's activities for an amount of €330m  in addition to new confirmed credit facilities for €200m.This acquisition will enable Axway to accelerate its strategic project through:- the birth of a new major player in enterprise software  achieving critical scale with a bold 2025 ambition of c. €700m revenue and c. €100m profit on operating activities2;- a secured leadership position in a combined total addressable market of c. $90B  with unique strengths in banking and financial services;- a diversified product portfolio extending across geographies  clients  and industries  capturing a variety of profitable niche markets to enhance overall stability;- a substantial opportunity to accelerate shareholder value creation through the combined entity's scale  becoming EPS accretive in 2026;- a maintained prudent and efficient capital structure with a 40% equity and 60% debt financing mix  with quick deleveraging possibilities;- a reaffirmed software pure-player project founded on shared DNA  culture  vision  and driven by an experienced management team.Birth of the 5th largest French Enterprise Software PublisherAxway Software + SBS 2023 RestatedAXW + 12M SBS 2024 GuidanceAXW + 4M SBS 2025 AmbitionAXW + SBS 2027 Ambition3-Years Plan Revenue €651m c. €460m c. €700m > €750m Margin on Operating Activities 12% 13 to 17% 14 to 16 % > 17% Restated items correspond to end-of-contract revenues and intra-group billings with Sopra Steria Group considered as non-recurring.On a restated from non-recurring items basis  the new combined entity would have generated annual revenue of €651m in 2023  with operating profit representing 12% of revenue.Sopra Banking Software's consolidation into Axway is scheduled for beginning of September 2024. Axway will therefore include Sopra Banking Software 's activities for the last four months of 2024 in its next annual financial statements. On this basis  the combined entity is aiming at 2024 revenue of around €460m and a margin on operating activities of between 13% and 17%.By 2025  pursuing its development at an annual organic growth rate of between 2% and 4%  Axway targets revenue of around €700m and a margin on operating activities of between 14% (around €100 million) and 16% which will reflect the full materialization of cost optimizations  of the order of €15m  expected on a full-year 2025 basis.By 2027  Axway ambitions to achieve revenue above €750m and a margin on operating activities of more than 17%. By 2028  the Company is aiming for a margin on operating activities at around 20% of revenue.In terms of cash generation and debt leverage  Axway has outlined the following ambitions:Axway Software + SBS End-2024Ambition End-2025Ambition End-2027Ambition Free Cash Flow / Revenue ‰ˆ 4% ‰ˆ 10% > 15% Net Leverage Ratio > 2.5x < 2.0x < 1.0xFree cash flow should represent around 10% of the new entity's revenue in 2025  gradually improving to over 15% by the end of 2027. This significant improvement in free cash flow will provide the Company with opportunities to rapidly reduce its financial leverage.At year-end 2024  Axway expects its net debt to EBITDA ratio to exceed 2.5x. By the end of 2025  this ratio should be below 2.0x  and by 2027 it is expected to be below 1.0x.Main terms of the capital increaseThe capital increase will be carried out with shareholders' preferential subscription rights  in accordance with the 18th resolution of Axway's shareholders general meeting held on May 11  2023  and will result in the issuance of 8 112 597 new shares  at a subscription price of €16.10 per share (i.e. a nominal value of €2.0 plus an issue premium of €14.10)  to be fully paid up upon subscription  representing gross proceeds  including the issue premium  of €130 612 811.70.The preferential subscription rights will be detached from the underlying existing shares on July 24  2024 and the existing shares will be traded ex-right from July 24  2024.Each share that a shareholder holds in its securities account on July 25  2024 (as close of trading) will entitle it to receive one Right. 8 Rights will entitle the holder to subscribe for 3 new shares  on an irreducible basis.Subscriptions on a reducible basis will be allowed. Any new share not subscribed on an irreducible basis will be distributed and allocated to the holders of Rights having submitted additional subscription orders on a reducible basis  subject to reduction in the event of oversubscription.Based on the closing price of Axway's share price on the regulated market of Euronext in Paris on July 19  2024  i.e. €27.50  the theoretical value of one Right is €3.11  and the theoretical value of the ex-right share is €24.39.For information purposes  the subscription price of the new shares reflects a discount of 34.0% to Axway's theoretical ex-right share price  based on the closing price on July 19  2024  and a facial discount of 41.5% to the closing price on July 19  2024.These values neither necessarily reflect the value of the Rights during their trading period  nor the value of Axway shares ex-rights  as they will be observed in the market.The capital increase will be opened to the public in France only.The capital increase is subject to a placement agreement between the Company and CrÃ©dit Agricole CIB and SociÃ©tÃ© GÃ©nÃ©rale as joint global coordinators and joint bookrunners.Indicative timetable of the share capital increaseThe Rights will be detached on July 24  2024 and will be tradable on Euronext Paris from July 24  2024 until the close of the preferential subscription rights trading period  i.e. until August 16  2024 included  according to the indicative timetable  under the ISIN code FR001400QJH1.The subscription period for the new shares will run from July 26  2024 to August 20  2024 included  according to the indicative timetable. Any Right not exercised before the end of the subscription period  i.e. on August 20  2024  shall automatically become null and void.The settlement and delivery of the new shares and admission of trading on Euronext Paris are expected to take place on August 27  2024. They will be immediately fungible with the Company's existing shares and will be traded under the same trading line and under the same ISIN code FR0011040500.Subscription and other commitments by Axway's main shareholdersUnder the terms of the purchase agreement entered into between Sopra GMT  as acquirer  and Sopra Steria Group  as seller  dated May 31  2024  Sopra GMT undertook to acquire:- 3 619 423 Axway shares  representing 16.73% of Axway's share capital and 10.98% of its theoretical voting rights  from Sopra Steria Group  at a price of €26.50 per Axway share  i.e. a total price of €95 914 709.5 (Axway Block Acquisition)  which was completed on July 19 2024; and- all 3 293 637 preferential subscription rights attached to the Axway shares held by Sopra Steria Group following the Axway Block Acquisition  which may be exercised as part of the capital increase  for a total price of €10 243 211.07 (the ""Rights Acquisition"").Sopra GMT has irrevocably undertaken to subscribe  on an irreducible basis  to the capital increase by exercising all of its preferential subscription rights  including those acquired as part of the Rights Acquisition from Sopra Steria Group  representing a total of approximately 52.8% of the capital increase.Moreover  Sopra GMT has irrevocably undertaken to subscribe for new shares not subscribed at the end of the subscription period (either on an irreducible or on a reducible basis)  in order to ensure that all new shares are subscribed.Patrick Donovan  the Company's CEO  has indicated that he intends to exercise all his preferential subscription rights  representing 0.7% of the capital increase.As of the date of the Prospectus  Axway is not aware of any subscription intentions from shareholders of the Company other than that mentioned above  nor of any subscription intentions from members of its administrative bodies.Lock-up undertakingsAxway has committed to a lock-up period starting on the signing date of the placement agreement and ending 180 calendar days following the settlement and delivery date of the new shares  subject to certain customary exceptions.Patrick Donovan  Chief Executive Officer  Sopra GMT and Sopra Steria Group have committed to a lock-up period starting on the date of approval by the AMF of the Prospectus related to the capital increase and ending 180 calendar days following the settlement and delivery date of the new shares  subject to certain customary exceptions (including  with respect to Patrick Donovan  his ability to pledge existing shares for the purposes of benefiting a financing dedicated to the subscription of new shares resulting from the exercise of his preferential subscription rights).DilutionFor illustrative purposes only  following the issue of the new shares  a shareholder holding 1% of the Company's share capital as of July 22  2024 and who does not participate in the capital increase  would hold 0.73% of the share capital.Availability of the ProspectusCopies of the French language Prospectus approved by the AMF on July 22 2024 under number 24-328  comprising and (i) the 2023 universal registration document filed with the AMF on March 25  2024 under number D.24-0175 (Document d'Enregistrement Universel 2023)  (ii) its amendment filed with the AMF on July 22 2024 under number D.24-0175-A01 (Amendement au Document d'Enregistrement Universel 2023)  and (iii) a securities note (Note d'OpÃ©ration) (including the summary of the Prospectus) is available free of charge from the Company's registered office  PAE Les Glaisins - 3 rue du PrÃ© Faucon  Annecy-le-Vieux - 74940 Annecy  France  as well as on the website of Axway Software (www.investors.axway.com/fr) and the AMF (www.amf-france.org).Risk factorsInvestors' attention is drawn by Axway Software to the chapter 2.1 (""Risk Factors"") of the 2023 universal registration document filed with the AMF on March 25  2024 under number D. 24-0175 and its amendment filed with the AMF on July 22 2024 under number D.24-0175-A01 and to section 2 ""Risk factors related to the offering"" of the securities note.About Sopra Banking SoftwareSopra Banking Software (SBS) is a global financial technology company that is helping banks and the financial services industry to reimagine how to operate in an increasingly digital world.

CETH is not a fund registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940  as amended (“1940 Act”)  and is not subject to regulation under the 1940 Act  unlike most exchange traded products or ETFs. CETH is subject to significant risk and heightened volatility. The fund is not suitable for all investors.With a total expense ratio (TER) of 0.21%  CETH’s investment objective is to seek to track the performance of Ether (ETH)  the second-largest crypto asset by market capitalization. In addition  CETH represents 21Shares’ latest addition to its growing lineup of US products and underscores the firm’s growth and commitment to the US market.Ethereum is a decentralized smart-contract platform that revolutionized the world of blockchain. ETH  the native crypto asset of the network  is the fuel that allows Ethereum to operate in the same way that we use oil to propel vehicles  heat buildings  and produce electricity in the physical world. Much like Bitcoin  Ethereum is a peer-to-peer network where transactions are recorded in a publicly available  decentralized ledger. What’s different about Ethereum is that it launched out of Bitcoin’s initial limitation as a simple settlement layer where people send and receive coins. From the start  Ethereum positioned itself as the infrastructure for building applications similar to websites or mobile applications on top of a fully decentralized internet. In other words  Ethereum provides a globally permissionless app store and a platform for Web3 – a new iteration of the world wide web – innovation.Since 2018  21Shares has pioneered the innovation of crypto asset exchange traded products (ETPs) globally  with listings on some of the biggest  most-liquid securities exchanges around the world  including London Stock Exchange  Nasdaq OMX  Euronext Paris and Amsterdam  Deutsche Börse Xetra  and SIX Swiss Exchange. This allows investors to gain exposure to crypto through their existing bank or brokerage  removes complexity around tax reporting  and offers investors better custody and operational risk management than holding physical crypto.""21Shares is at the forefront of a financial revolution  as investor demand for crypto asset ETF continues to ramp up in lock-step with evolving regulatory frameworks around the world. Our mission – to make crypto assets more accessible to investors  and to bridge the gap between traditional finance and decentralized finance – is now more attainable than ever. There is a growing acceptance that crypto is here to stay and will play a role in the evolution of the financial system ” said Ophelia Snyder  Co-founder and President of 21Shares.Snyder continued  “While Bitcoin is often classified closely with commodities  Ethereum presents a unique investment case. As a platform that fuels innovation and powers the next generation of the internet  Ethereum aligns more closely with technology investments  marking an exciting potential opportunity for investors. CETH  as the latest addition to 21Shares’ growing US product lineup  represents an important step for crypto asset accessibility to US investors and we’re thrilled to bring this product to the US market.”CETH is 21Shares’ seventh product in the US and underscores 21Shares’ continued growth in the US market  which now includes over $3.2bn in assets under management and nearly 50 full-time employees.Since its inception  21Shares has a track record of advancing innovative crypto asset products  creating a bridge for investors between traditional finance and decentralized finance  and has demonstrated operational and client service excellence with a focus on transparency  risk management  and sustainability.Press Contact:21Shares: Audrey Belloff  audrey.belloff@21.coAbout 21Shares US LLC21Shares US LLC serves as the sponsor to the the 21Shares Core Ethereum ETF. 21Shares US LLC is an affiliate of 21Shares AG  one of the world’s leaders in providing access to crypto through TradFi and DeFi. 21Shares AG issues cryptocurrency-backed exchange traded products (ETPs) outside the United States in a number of global markets. 21Shares AG’s ETPs are built on its proprietary operating system  Onyx  which is also available to third parties.

This reflects a 24% decline at constant exchange rates and perimeter3 and a slightly positive currency impact of 1%.Pierre Barnabé  Soitec’s CEO  commented: “The low point reached in the first quarter of our fiscal year 2025 was anticipated and is in line with our expectations  in a challenging market environment. The absorption of our customers' RF-SOI inventories is progressing and should be completed towards the end of the first half of our fiscal year 2025. Beyond this quarter  the gradual recovery in RF-SOI deliveries and the continued growth of our increasingly diversified product portfolio will underpin the revenue increase throughout the second part of fiscal year 2025. We therefore reiterate our full year guidance.Looking ahead  Soitec’s organic growth will be underpinned in all three of its end markets by increasingly powerful megatrends: 5G expansion and the continued premiumization of smartphones  the ongoing digitization and electrification of the automotive sector  the proliferation of edge AI devices  and the expansion of cloud AI computing power capabilities in a more sustainable way. Our innovation and industrial roadmaps are designed to reinforce our leadership in SOI while accelerating the diversification of our portfolio of engineered substrates with new compound semiconductors  beyond SOI.”First quarter FY’25 consolidated revenue (unaudited)Q1’25 Q1’24 Q1’25/Q1’24 (Euros millions) change reported chg. at const. exch. rates & perimeter Mobile Communications 48 89 -45% -46% Automotive & Industrial 26 37 -29% -31% Edge and Cloud AI (previously Smart Devices) 46 31 +49% +47% Total revenue 121 157 -23% -24%In line with announced expectations  Soitec revenue reached 121 million Euros in the first quarter of FY’25  a 24% year-on-year decrease at constant exchange rates and perimeter3 compared to the first quarter of FY’24  reflecting contrasted performance across Soitec’s three end markets. Decline in Mobile Communications and Automotive & Industrial revenue was only partially compensated by a strong performance in Edge and Cloud AI (previously named Smart Devices). The new name of the division does not imply any change in perimeter and reporting.Mobile CommunicationsIn the first quarter of FY’25  Mobile Communications revenue stood at 48 million Euros  down 46% at constant exchange rates compared to the first quarter of FY’24.Soitec continues to see signs of recovery in the smartphone market  as well as improving inventory levels at fabless and OEMs companies. In the first quarter of FY’25  RF-SOI wafers demand was slower to let persisting inventories flow down the value chain  resulting in substantially lower volumes compared to the first quarter of FY'24. Soitec remains confident that sales of RF-SOI wafers will recover in the second half of FY’25  as the inventory absorption among its direct customers ends.On the other hand  sales of POI (Piezoelectric-on-Insulator) wafers dedicated to RF filters have been significantly growing quarter-over-quarter since the beginning of fiscal year 2024  with another sequential growth recorded in the first quarter of FY’25 compared to the fourth quarter of FY’24. This is translating into a sharp year-on-year increase against the first quarter of FY’24. POI activity benefited from the addition of another new customer in production  bringing the total to nine  while more than ten customers remain in the qualification phase. POI wafers continue to benefit from a strong acceleration in China and Soitec’s engagement with all leading US fabless companies.Sales of FD-SOI wafers  designed to equip front end modules integrated in both 5G Sub-6 GHz and 5G mmWave smartphones  were slightly lower than in the first quarter of FY’24.Automotive & IndustrialAutomotive & Industrial revenue reached 26 million Euros in the first quarter of FY’25  a 31% year-on-year decline at constant exchange rates compared to the first quarter of FY’24. After a very strong fiscal year 2024  revenue was impacted in the first quarter of FY’25 by a slower automotive market.After several quarters of significant year-on-year growth leading to a very strong fourth quarter of FY’24  Power-SOI wafer sales showed a decline in the first quarter of FY’25 compared to the first quarter of FY’24. This was essentially driven by lower volumes impacted by a slower automotive market. Power-SOI remains a key component for gate drivers  in vehicle networking and increasingly Battery Management ICs  supported by an increasing number of foundries and IDMs worldwide.In the first quarter of FY’25  FD-SOI wafer sales  which continue to be mostly driven by adoption for automotive microcontrollers  imagers  radar and wireless connectivity  recorded another good performance.Automotive & Industrial continued to benefit from revenue generated by Soitec’s SmartSiCTM cutting-edge silicon carbide technology. SmartSiCTM deliveries of samples and prototypes are growing. Device qualifications and SmartSiCTM wafer production ramp-up at Soitec’s plant will continue step by step driven by customer demand and EV penetration.During the first quarter of FY’25  Soitec announced a new offer with X-FAB to provide the foundry’s extensive fabless client network with power devices based on Soitec’s SmartSiCTM wafers.Edge and Cloud AI (previously Smart Devices)Edge and Cloud AI revenue reached 46 million Euros in the first quarter of FY’25  representing a 47% increase at constant exchange rates compared to the first quarter of FY’24  with contrasted performance among the different products.Sales of Imager-SOI wafers for 3D imaging applications were particularly strong in the first quarter of FY’25  benefitting from a phasing effect.Sales of Photonics-SOI wafers were higher than in the first quarter of FY’24. The strong traction is led by a growing appetite for more powerful and more energy-efficient data centers required to deliver on the exponential growth of AI-related computing power capabilities. Photonics-SOI is now a standard technology platform for high-speed and high bandwidth optical interconnections in data centers  adopted in pluggable optical transceivers  and used for the development of Co-Packaged Optics.Sales of FD-SOI wafers  which remain driven by the demand for Edge Computing devices across consumer and industrial sectors  were below the level reached in the first quarter of FY’24  impacted by a phasing effect.FY’25 outlook confirmedSoitec confirms expecting FY’25 revenue to be stable year-on-year at constant exchange rates and perimeter as compared to FY’24  with an expected decline of around 15% in the first half of FY’25 against the first half of FY’24 and a rebound anticipated in the second half of FY’25  driven by the recovery of the RF-SOI activity following the end of the inventory absorption among Soitec’s customers  supported by a rebound in the smartphone market  and the continued adoption of POI.Soitec also confirms expecting FY’25 EBITDA1 margin2 to be around 35%.Key events of Q1’25X-FAB and Soitec team up to offer SmartSiC™ at Lubbock plant  USAOn May 22nd  2024  Soitec announced a partnership to bring power devices based on Soitec’s cutting-edge SmartSiC™ silicon carbide wafers to X-FAB’s extensive fabless client network. The ambition is to offer Soitec’s SmartSiC™ wafers for the production of silicon carbide power devices at X-FAB’s plant in Lubbock  Texas. This collaboration follows the successful completion of the assessment phase  during which silicon carbide (SiC) power devices were manufactured at X-FAB Texas on 150mm SmartSiC™ wafers. Soitec will offer X-FAB’s customers easy access to the SmartSiC™ substrate through a joint supply chain consignment model. X-FAB is the pioneer and leader of the foundry model in the fast-growing SiC market.Soitec enters into a strategic partnership with Tokai Carbon to develop polycrystalline silicon carbide substrates for Soitec SmartSiCTM wafersOn May 22nd  2024  Soitec and Tokai Carbon  a comprehensive manufacturer of carbon and graphite products  have entered into a strategic partnership for the development and supply of polycrystalline silicon carbide substrates specifically designed for Soitec SmartSiCTM wafers. Under this partnership  which will see Tokai Carbon supply 150mm and 200mm polySiC wafers to Soitec  the two companies are harnessing their advanced R&D capabilities to enhance the SmartSiCTM ecosystem. Tokai Carbon’s advanced technology and manufacturing capacity in polycrystalline silicon carbide (polySiC) combined with the right to use Soitec specifications for polySiC coarse wafers compliant with Soitec SmartSiCTM is expected to make a strategic contribution to the global ramp-up of SmartSiCTM wafer production.Soitec extends partnership with UMC to provide leading engineered substrates for industry’s first 3D IC solution for RF-SOIOn June 13th  2024  Soitec announced the expansion of its partnership with UMC  a leading global semiconductor foundry company  to bring to the market the industry’s first 3D IC solution for RF-SOI technology for the 5G era.

A total of 6 237 vehicles were delivered  representing a 67.4% increase.

B2C vehicle volumes returned to a positive trend as expected after several quarters of decline  increasing by 16% in the third quarter of 2024 compared to last year.

A halh-year of investmentThe Econocom Group generated revenue of €1 335 million in the first half of 2024  up 3.0% compared with the same period in 2023 (vs. +2.6% in Q1) with all businesses contributing to this growth. In organic terms  growth came to 2.9%  in the absence of major changes to the scope of consolidation.Over the period  trends in continuing operations were as follows:Technology Management & Financing (TMF) posted revenue of €506 million  an increase of 6.1%  including +5.9% organic growth. The group is capitalising on the quality of its flexible  customised financing offers to expand sales in targeted geographical regions. In line with its strategic plan  in the first half  Econocom continues to pursue its investments to recruit Account Managers and agents and update operational sales tools. As a result  operating margin came to €14.6 million  down €2.5 million compared with H1 2023.Products & Solutions (P&S) revenue totalled €591 million  up 1.1%. After a first quarter which saw a 2.5% decline in business  growth recovered during the second quarter  driven by stronger trends in the European IT distribution market. Operating margin came to €14.4 million  down slightly by €1.1 million compared with H1 2023.At end-June 2024  the Services business reported revenue of €239 million  up 1.2% on a purely organic basis. Operating margin accordingly was €9.3 million  in line with the first half-year 2023.Overall  the Group's operating margin was €38.3 million.Other operating income and expenses amounted to -€4.1 million  i.e. down by €0.3 million compared to the amount recorded for the same period in 2023.After financial income of -€5.9 million  an income tax expense of -€9.3 million and profit (loss) from discontinued operations of €5.7 million  consolidated net profit totalled €23.1 million for the first half of 2024 vs. €24.7 million for the same period of the previous year.Sharp decline in net financial debtIn line with the commitments made as part of the One econocom strategic plan for 2024-2028  the group launched its non-strategic asset divestment programme to help self-fund its external growth policy. As part of this programme  in early June  the group finalised the disposal of its Les Abeilles subsidiary  enabling it to raise just over half of the €180 million disposal proceeds planned as part of the One econocom plan.Furthermore  over the past 12 months  the group generated €88 million in free cash flow thanks to efforts made by all of its entities to reduce their working capital requirements.Thanks to these two impacts  net financial debt was down to €180 million at end-June 2024  compared with €321 million a year earlier. This level of indebtness at end-June is the lowest seen over the past 10 years at the same time.New governanceThe Econocom Board of Directors unanimously approved the separation of the roles of Chairman and CEO  as well as the appointment of Angel Benguigui as Group CEO. Jean-Louis Bouchard  founder of Econocom  is now the Operational Chairman. Angel Benguigui will be able to rely on his support and advice  in keeping with the excellent dialogue and climate of trust they have built over their many years working together. An Executive Committee will be announced soon  to strengthen the skills and enhance the complementary profiles of the Management team.2024 OutlookGiven these strong trends at end-June  Econocom confirms its 2024 guidance of generating revenue growth of between 3% and 5%.Next publication: information meeting on H1 2024 results  25 July 2024ABOUT ECONOCOMThe Econocom Group  created 50 years ago  is a pioneer in supporting the digital transformation of companies.
