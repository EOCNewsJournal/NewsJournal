The European Commission’s Josep Borrell announced on Mo…,"Russia promises a response to the West’s “theft” of its assets as EU plans to send interest earned on Russian funds to UkraineThe European Union has announced its intention to send over the first tranche of interest earned by frozen Russian funds to Kiev next month  and Russia has vowed to respond to what it maintains is theft.The European Commission’s Josep Borrell announced on Monday that the $1.5 billion in interest will be sent to Ukraine during the first week of August to help the country cover its arms purchases.A spokesman for the Kremlin  Dmitry Peskov  said that there will be retaliation against the West for expropriating the assets  with legal proceedings in the works against the entities that they believe stole roughly $282 billion worth of Russian assets. The money in question is still frozen.“Such acts of thievery cannot remain without a response. This money is not only stolen  but also spent to buy weapons. It’s hard to imagine anything worse ” he stated.Calling it a violation of both international law and property rights  he said that legal remedies would be used to fight back.Not long after fighting broke out between Ukraine and Russia  the West froze around $300 billion worth of Russian central bank assets  most of which are now in the EU depositary Euroclear. The assets are largely made up of bonds and other types of securities Russia’s central bank invested in. The EU believes the assets could yield as much as $22 billion in profits by 2027.The EU approved a plan in May that will see the interest these frozen assets earn being sent to Ukraine to help its defense and recovery. While 90% of the proceeds will be devoted to military aid for Ukraine  10% must be used for other types of support to appease some EU members who were unwilling to provide Kiev with military support.Human knowledge is under attack!

He said: “Despite all the chicanery  theft will certainly remain theft. And it will not go unpunished. Now it is becoming obvious to all countries  companies [and] sovereign funds that their assets and reserves are far from safe in both the legal and economic sense of the word. … Anyone could be next in line for expropriation by the U.S. and the West.""Yellen pushed back  insisting there is no basis for the theft claim. On ABC News’ This Week  she noted that ""[the assets have] been impounded  the investments that Russia had have matured  so Russia's funds are sitting in cash. But they're generating income for the institution  which Russia has no claim on.""Russia has already been leveraging the situation to convince more countries to join the BRICS economic bloc of nations and move away from the U.S. dollar to soften the blow of Western sanctions and chip away at the dollar's dominance on the global stage.Sources for this article include:Reuters.comRT.comABCNews.go.com",neutral,0.01,0.92,0.07,negative,0.01,0.26,0.73,True,English,"['Russian funds', 'response', 'West', 'theft', 'assets', 'EU', 'interest', 'Ukraine', 'NaturalNews', 'U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen', 'new decentralized, blockchain-power Brighteon.io', 'free, downloadable generative AI tools', 'Russian central bank assets', 'U.S. dollar', 'The European Union', 'The European Commission', 'BRICS economic bloc', 'EU depositary Euroclear', 'Brighteon.AI', 'AI technology', 'economic sense', 'first tranche', 'Josep Borrell', 'first week', 'arms purchases', 'Dmitry Peskov', '$282 billion worth', 'international law', 'property rights', '$300 billion worth', 'other types', 'military aid', 'Human knowledge', 'powerful corporations', 'knowledge base', 'natural immunity', 'food production', 'human freedom', 'HealthRangerStore.com', 'GMO foods', 'nutritional solutions', '$50 million loan', 'ABC News', 'Western sanctions', 'global stage', 'Russian funds', 'Russian assets', 'EU members', 'sovereign funds', 'legal proceedings', 'legal remedies', 'frozen assets', 'military support', 'Seven nations', 'theft claims', 'response', 'interest', 'Ukraine', 'intention', 'Kiev', 'Monday', 'August', 'country', 'spokesman', 'Kremlin', 'retaliation', 'works', 'entities', 'money', 'question', 'acts', 'thievery', 'weapons', 'fighting', 'bonds', 'securities', 'profits', 'plan', 'May', 'defense', 'recovery', 'proceeds', 'attack', 'Governments', 'censorship', 'humanity', 'herbs', 'self-reliance', 'preparedness', 'infrastructure', 'efforts', 'shopping', 'Group', 'agreement', 'moves', 'Moscow', 'Comments', 'Putin', 'Reuters', 'chicanery', 'countries', 'companies', 'reserves', 'word', 'Anyone', 'line', 'expropriation', 'basis', 'investments', 'cash', 'income', 'institution', 'situation', 'blow', 'dominance', 'Sources', 'article', 'ABCNews']",2024-07-24,2024-07-25,naturalnews.com

This operation provides for the allotment of one (1) BSA per share held  3 BSA giving the right to subscribe for 2 new shares from August 2  2024 at an exercise price fixed at €0.0125  representing a premium of 13.64% over the closing price on July 23  2024.Bradley Taylor  Chief Executive Officer of Tonner Drones  said: ""This free allocation of warrants is designed to provide all Tonner Drones’ shareholders with the opportunity to continue to support the Company’s funding by associating themselves with the Company's growth potential through this complementary instrument to the share. Tonner Drones has achieved a number of milestones in recent months with a strategic repositioning and financial restructuring  including an agreement to discontinue all instruments providing access to capital at a variable price"".Pursuant to the delegation of authority granted to it by the Ordinary and Extraordinary General Meetings of Shareholders held on January 27  2023 (3th resolution)  the Board of Directors of the Company  at its meeting held on July 12  2024  adopted the principle of issuing and granting free share warrants to the shareholders of the Company and subdelegated all powers to the Chief Executive Officer of the Company for this purpose. On July 23  2024  the Chief Executive Officer decided to issue and grant free share warrants to all shareholders  in accordance with the terms and conditions set out below.The transaction will benefit all of the Company's shareholders  i.e.  the holders of the 226 425 716 shares.To date  the Company is not aware of the intentions of its major shareholders in relation to the exercise of the BSA.To the best of the Company's knowledge  the share capital and voting rights of Tonner Drones are as follows:Shareholders Nombre d’actions % du capital % des droits de vote Ott Heritage (1) 40 270 000 17.79% 17.79% Courcelette Holdings (2) 30 000 0.01% 0.01% Treasury stock 30 0.00% 0.00% Public 186 125 686 82.20% 82.20% TOTAL 226 425 716 100.00% 100.00%(1) Company controlled by Mr. Jean-François OTT  Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company.(2) Company controlled by Mr. Bradley TAYLOR  CEO of the Company.DESCRIPTION OF THE TRANSACTIONOn August 2  2024  each shareholder of Tonner Drones will receive  free of charge  one (1) BSA for each share held. Based on the Company's share capital  a maximum of 226 425 716 BSAs will be issued.Three (3) BSAs will entitle their holders to subscribe for two (2) new shares in Tonner Drones at an exercise price per share of €0.0125  i.e.  the potential creation (if all BSA are exercised) of 150 950 477 new shares representing a maximum theoretical capital increase of €1 886 880.9625.This exercise price of €0.0125 represents a premium of 13.64% over the closing price on July 23  2024 of €0.0110 and of 55.10% over the closing price less the theoretical value of the BSA calculated on the basis of the ex-BSA share price (i.e.  €0.0081 based on a theoretical value of a BSA of €0.0029).The 226 425 716 warrants will be the subject of an application for admission to listing on the Euronext Growth Paris market. They will therefore be listed on a separate line and entitled ""BSA"" (ISIN: FR001400RIB4).The term of the warrants is set at three (3) years from the date of their allotment  i.e.  until August 2  2027 inclusive.Each request to exercise the BSA must be for a minimum of 135 000 BSA to enable the subscription of a minimum of 90 000 new Tonner Drones shares.PROCEEDS OF THE TRANSACTIONIf all the BSA are exercised  the gross proceeds of the transaction could amount to €1 886 880.9625.OBJECTIVES OF THE OPERATIONThe purpose of this operation to issue warrants  which will be allocated free of charge to all shareholders in proportion to their shareholdings  is to :strengthen the loyalty of the Company's existing institutional and individual shareholders attract new investors interested in the optional nature of the share warrants  andenable the Company to raise funds when the warrants are exercised.

No market for the warrantsThere can be no guarantee that a market will develop for the BSA once they are listed or that their holders will be able to sell them on the secondary market.There is no obligation to create a market for the BSA.If a market for the BSA does develop  the warrants may be subject to greater volatility than Tonner Drones shares.2. The market price of the Company's shares may never reach the exercise price of the warrants.There can be no assurance that the market price of the Company's shares will exceed the exercise price of the warrants and the subscription price of the new shares issued upon exercise of the warrants. Accordingly  no assurance can be given that investors will be able to sell their shares at a price equal to or greater than the subscription price of the shares issued upon exercise of the BSA upon exercise of the BSA.3. Risk of loss of the BSA investmentBSA holders who purchase their BSA on the market after the free allocation and who do not sell or exercise their BSA before midnight August 2  2027 will lose their entire investment.4. Dilution riskTo the extent that shareholders do not exercise their warrants  their percentage interest in the capital and voting rights of Tonner Drones will be reduced if the warrants are exercised by the other holders. A shareholder holding 1% of the capital prior to the free allocation of the BSA to all shareholders and who decides not to exercise the BSA received as part of this transaction would see his stake in the capital fall to 0.60% if all the BSA were exercised. Even if shareholders choose to sell their warrants  the potential consideration they would receive may not be sufficient to compensate for this dilution.DISCLAIMERThis press release and the information contained herein does not constitute an offer to sell or subscribe for  or the solicitation of an order to buy or subscribe for  shares in Tonner Drones in any jurisdiction.

These firms often exhibit strong alignment between management’s interests and shareholder returns  particularly in environments where earnings growth is robust.Top 5 Growth Companies With High Insider Ownership In The NetherlandsName Insider Ownership Earnings Growth BenevolentAI (ENXTAM:BAI) 27.8% 62.8% Ebusco Holding (ENXTAM:EBUS) 33.2% 114.0% Envipco Holding (ENXTAM:ENVI) 36.7% 68.9% MotorK (ENXTAM:MTRK) 35.8% 105.8% Basic-Fit (ENXTAM:BFIT) 12% 65.2% PostNL (ENXTAM:PNL) 35.8% 23.9%Click here to see the full list of 6 stocks from our Fast Growing Euronext Amsterdam Companies With High Insider Ownership screener.Here's a peek at a few of the choices from the screener.Simply Wall St Growth Rating: ★★★★★☆Overview: Envipco Holding N.V. specializes in the design  development  manufacturing  assembly  marketing  selling  leasing  and servicing of reverse vending machines for recycling used beverage containers primarily in the Netherlands  North America  and other parts of Europe; it has a market capitalization of approximately €328.84 million.Operations: Envipco Holding N.V. generates its revenues by offering solutions for the recycling of used beverage containers through the sale and lease of reverse vending machines  primarily across the Netherlands  North America  and other European regions.Insider Ownership: 36.7%Earnings Growth Forecast: 68.9% p.a.Envipco Holding N.V. has demonstrated a robust turnaround  transitioning from a net loss to profitability with its first-quarter sales soaring to €27.44 million from €10.41 million year-over-year. The company's revenue and earnings are forecasted to grow significantly  outpacing the Dutch market averages with expected annual increases of 33.3% and 68.9%  respectively. Despite recent shareholder dilution and high share price volatility  insider transactions have been more biased towards purchases than sales over the past three months  reflecting some level of confidence among those closest to the company.ENXTAM:ENVI Ownership Breakdown as at Jul 2024Simply Wall St Growth Rating: ★★★★★☆Overview: MotorK plc operates in the automotive retail industry  offering software-as-a-service solutions across Italy  Spain  France  Germany  and the Benelux Union  with a market capitalization of approximately €267.12 million.Story continuesOperations: MotorK's revenue is primarily generated from its software and programming segment  totaling €42.94 million.Insider Ownership: 35.8%Earnings Growth Forecast: 105.8% p.a.MotorK  amidst a transitional phase with recent executive reshuffles  including a new CFO from Sportradar  is poised for significant growth. Although currently unprofitable  MotorK's revenue is expected to rise by 24% annually  outstripping the Dutch market's 10% growth rate. However  past shareholder dilution raises concerns. The company's journey towards profitability within three years and robust revenue projections highlight its potential in the high insider ownership segment of growth companies in the Netherlands.ENXTAM:MTRK Ownership Breakdown as at Jul 2024Simply Wall St Growth Rating: ★★★★☆☆Overview: PostNL N.V. offers postal and logistics services across the Netherlands  Europe  and globally  with a market capitalization of approximately €0.69 billion.Operations: The company's revenue segments include €2.25 billion from packages and €1.35 billion from mail services in the Netherlands.Insider Ownership: 35.8%Earnings Growth Forecast: 23.9% p.a.PostNL  despite a recent net loss of €20 million and a decline in quarterly sales to €763 million  is positioned for recovery with expected earnings growth of 23.9% per year. The company's high insider ownership aligns with substantial fixed-income offerings totaling nearly €300 million  signaling confidence in long-term sustainability. However  its revenue growth forecast at 3.3% per year lags behind the broader Dutch market projection of 10%  and the firm grapples with high debt levels.ENXTAM:PNL Earnings and Revenue Growth as at Jul 2024Turning Ideas Into ActionsDive into all 6 of the Fast Growing Euronext Amsterdam Companies With High Insider Ownership we have identified here.Shareholder in one or more of these companies?

On July 23  2024  the Chief Executive Officer decided to issue and grant free share warrants to all shareholders  in accordance with the terms and conditions set out below.The transaction will benefit all of the Company's shareholders  i.e.  the holders of the 226 425 716 shares.To date  the Company is not aware of the intentions of its major shareholders in relation to the exercise of the BSA.To the best of the Company's knowledge  the share capital and voting rights of Tonner Drones are as follows:Shareholders Nombre d’actions % du capital % des droits de vote Ott Heritage (1) 40 270 000 17.79% 17.79% Courcelette Holdings (2) 30 000 0.01% 0.01% Treasury stock 30 0.00% 0.00% Public 186 125 686 82.20% 82.20% TOTAL 226 425 716 100.00% 100.00%(1) Company controlled by Mr. Jean-François OTT  Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Company.(2) Company controlled by Mr. Bradley TAYLOR  CEO of the Company.DESCRIPTION OF THE TRANSACTIONOn August 2  2024  each shareholder of Tonner Drones will receive  free of charge  one (1) BSA for each share held. Based on the Company's share capital  a maximum of 226 425 716 BSAs will be issued.Three (3) BSAs will entitle their holders to subscribe for two (2) new shares in Tonner Drones at an exercise price per share of €0.0125  i.e.  the potential creation (if all BSA are exercised) of 150 950 477 new shares representing a maximum theoretical capital increase of €1 886 880.9625.This exercise price of €0.0125 represents a premium of 13.64% over the closing price on July 23  2024 of €0.0110 and of 55.10% over the closing price less the theoretical value of the BSA calculated on the basis of the ex-BSA share price (i.e.  €0.0081 based on a theoretical value of a BSA of €0.0029).The 226 425 716 warrants will be the subject of an application for admission to listing on the Euronext Growth Paris market. They will therefore be listed on a separate line and entitled ""BSA"" (ISIN: FR001400RIB4).The term of the warrants is set at three (3) years from the date of their allotment  i.e.  until August 2  2027 inclusive.Each request to exercise the BSA must be for a minimum of 135 000 BSA to enable the subscription of a minimum of 90 000 new Tonner Drones shares.PROCEEDS OF THE TRANSACTIONIf all the BSA are exercised  the gross proceeds of the transaction could amount to €1 886 880.9625.OBJECTIVES OF THE OPERATIONThe purpose of this operation to issue warrants  which will be allocated free of charge to all shareholders in proportion to their shareholdings  is to :strengthen the loyalty of the Company's existing institutional and individual shareholders attract new investors interested in the optional nature of the share warrants  andenable the Company to raise funds when the warrants are exercised.

No market for the warrantsThere can be no guarantee that a market will develop for the BSA once they are listed or that their holders will be able to sell them on the secondary market.There is no obligation to create a market for the BSA.If a market for the BSA does develop  the warrants may be subject to greater volatility than Tonner Drones shares.2. The market price of the Company's shares may never reach the exercise price of the warrants.There can be no assurance that the market price of the Company's shares will exceed the exercise price of the warrants and the subscription price of the new shares issued upon exercise of the warrants. Accordingly  no assurance can be given that investors will be able to sell their shares at a price equal to or greater than the subscription price of the shares issued upon exercise of the BSA upon exercise of the BSA.3. Risk of loss of the BSA investmentBSA holders who purchase their BSA on the market after the free allocation and who do not sell or exercise their BSA before midnight August 2  2027 will lose their entire investment.4. Dilution riskTo the extent that shareholders do not exercise their warrants  their percentage interest in the capital and voting rights of Tonner Drones will be reduced if the warrants are exercised by the other holders. A shareholder holding 1% of the capital prior to the free allocation of the BSA to all shareholders and who decides not to exercise the BSA received as part of this transaction would see his stake in the capital fall to 0.60% if all the BSA were exercised. Even if shareholders choose to sell their warrants  the potential consideration they would receive may not be sufficient to compensate for this dilution.DISCLAIMERThis press release and the information contained herein does not constitute an offer to sell or subscribe for  or the solicitation of an order to buy or subscribe for  shares in Tonner Drones in any jurisdiction.

44086,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://www.investing.com/news/company-news/goldman-sachs-lowers-lvmh-shares-target-cites-modest-growth-93CH-3532710,Goldman Sachs lowers LVMH shares target  cites modest growth By Investing.com,Goldman Sachs lowers LVMH shares target  cites modest growth,On Wednesday  Goldman Sachs adjusted its price target on LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (OTC: ) (Euronext Paris:MC) (OTC:LVMUY) shares  reducing it from EUR 960.00 to EUR 930.00  while continuing to recommend a Buy rating for the luxury goods company.The revision follows LVMH's first-half 2024 results  which revealed a modest 1% growth in constant foreign exchange (cFX) for the second quarter of the year  falling short of market expectations.The company's performance in the second quarter  with an organic sales growth of 1% cFX year-over-year  did not meet the predictions set by Visible Alpha Consensus Data and Goldman Sachs Estimates (GSE)  both of which anticipated a 3% growth.The slight underperformance was attributed to the results from LVMH's key segments. The flagship Fashion and Leather division saw a 1% cFX increase  just below the forecasted 2%.Additionally  the Wines & Spirits division of LVMH experienced a decline  with sales dropping by 5% cFX  which was a weaker outcome than the consensus estimate of a 4% decrease but performed better than Goldman Sachs' more pessimistic expectation of a 6% fall.The report highlighted that this downturn was due to subdued sell-in trends  particularly in the United States and China  as inventories among wholesale partners are in the process of normalization.The Watches and Jewellery division also faced challenges  reporting a 4% cFX decrease in sales  which was slightly worse than the consensus estimate of a 3% contraction. The results across LVMH's divisions reflect the varying degrees of market pressures and the impacts of inventory adjustments on the company's overall growth trajectory.Despite the reduction in the price target  Goldman Sachs' stance on LVMH remains positive  as indicated by the maintained Buy rating. This suggests that the financial institution continues to see value in the stock  even as it acknowledges the near-term headwinds faced by the luxury retailer.In other recent news  LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE has been the subject of various analyst notes and significant corporate developments. Citi reaffirmed its Buy rating on LVMH  maintaining a price target of EUR887.00  despite the company's second-quarter results revealing a sequential slowdown in organic sales growth. However  the firm anticipates that consensus forecasts for LVMH's full-year 2024 group sales and EBIT may be revised downwards by a low single-digit percentage.On the other hand  UBS revised its price target for LVMH shares  reducing it from EUR844.00 to EUR800.00  while maintaining a Neutral rating. The bank's analysts anticipate a 2% earnings per share decrease for LVMH for fiscal years 2024 through 2026  mainly due to pressure within the Fashion & Leather Goods and Wines & Spirits divisions.Adding to the developments  LVMH has acquired Swiss clock manufacturer L'Epee 1839  aiming to strengthen its presence in high-end watchmaking. This follows LVMH's recent purchase of French bistro Chez l'Ami Louis  indicating a focus on experiential luxury offerings.First-quarter sales of €20 694 million were reported  closely aligning with market projections. These are recent developments that investors are likely to follow closely.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

More particularly  we recorded a strong growth in our rental income (+8%) and recurring net income (+7%)  as well as a significant and proactive reduction in our debt with an EPRA LTV down 4 points over 6 months to 46%.In 2024  we have decided to further accelerate our debt reduction and growth paths with a capital increase in April  that successfully led to raising €150 million. We are thus now aiming for an average annual increase in our rental income of +7% over the 2024-2026 period (vs. +5% previously) and EPRA LTV of 44% by the end of 2024 (vs. 48% previously)  and around 38% by the end of 2026.Building on a strong balance sheet  Argan is now  more than ever  on track to fully benefit from the favourable trends linked to the development of the logistics real estate in France. »2024 targets confirmed:Indicators Updated 2024 targets Initial 2024 targets Full year 2023 Trendsvs. 2023 Rental income €197m €197m €184m +7% Recurring net income – Group share €135m* €133m €126m +7% Dividend per share €3.303 €3.301 €3.15 +5%* The 2024 target for the recurring net income was raised as part of the capital increase that took place on April 23  2024.

The procedures related to the limited review of our statutory auditors on these consolidated financial statements have been finalized  and their limited review report was issued.Strong growth in main financial indicatorsARGAN recorded strong increases in its main financial indicators in the first six months of 2024. Rental income and Group share recurring net income grew at a sustained and similar pace  recording respectively +8% and +7%. These results are a demonstration of our Group’s ability to turn its very good business momentum into created value and lasting cash flows.Sustained growth in rental income: +8%Rental income grew +8% in the first half of 2024  to €98 million. This sustained increase mainly came from the rents’ indexation (+4.6%) that took place on January 1  2024  complemented by the full-year impact of 2023 deliveries and 2024 deliveries.Building on a high-quality PRIME portfolio  in demanded locations  the occupancy rate remained at 100% for the 6th consecutive quarter in a rental market with a vacancy rate that is still low (vacancy at 4.3% in France at the end of June 2024 according to CBRE). Our EPRA vacancy rate was thus 0% at the end of June 2024.Increase in the Group share recurring net income: +7%  in line with rental incomeGroup share recurring net income was up +7%  at €67 million at the end of June 2024  representing a margin on rental income that was maintained at a high level of 68%. This testifies to the soundness of Argan’s hedging policy  thus limiting the impact on Group’s cost of debt coming from rates increases that took place when comparing the first half of 2023 to the first half of 2024.Thanks to a fair value variation of our portfolio that is once again turning positive  for +€17.0 million over 6 months  the consolidated Group share net income was €90.9 million at the end of June 2024.Back to an increasing portfolio valueA premium portfolio appraised (excl. duties) at €3.76 billionThe portfolio delivered (excluding properties under development) represented 3 615 000 sq.m asat June 30  2024. Excluding duties  the valuation was €3.76 billion (€3.98 billion including duties)  i.e.  an increase of +2% from December 31  2023.The capitalisation rate excluding duties was thus 5.30%  a slight increase from 5.10 %  which was the rate excluding duties recorded on December 31  2023. Including duties  the capitalisation rate (EPRA Net Initial Yield) was 5.00%  reflecting the PREMIUM quality of our assets.The average residual lease term was 5.5 years as at June 30  2024 and the weighted average age was 11.5 years.A record development pipeline for 2024: €180 million7In total  ARGAN has thus commitments for close to €180 million in developments representing 170 000 sq.m in 2024  generating an average yield approaching 7%. The high profitability of projects to be delivered in 2024 reflects ARGAN’s ability to pursue its profitable growth momentum  driven by a portfolio of Aut0nom® -labelled warehouses on strategic locations  as part of an approach of pre-let projects and long-term partnerships with reliable and blue-chip clients.Stable NAV EPRA of continuation (NTA): €79 per shareThe NRV (reconstitution NAV) was €89.7 per share as at June 30  2024 (-1% over 6 months).The NTA (continuation NAV) was €78.9 per share as at June 30  2024 (almost stable over 6 months).The NDV (liquidation NAV) was €82.8 per share as at June 30  2024 (-1% over 6 months).More particularly  the trend in the NTA (continuation NAV) over the half-year represents  in value  a limited decrease of -€0.2 compared with December 31  2023. This came from the net result per share (+€2.7)  the change in the value of the assets (+€0.7)  the dilutive impact of the new shares created as part of the capital increase that took place in H1 2024 (-€0.5)  the payment of the dividend in cash (-€2.1) and in shares (-€1.0).A sound balance sheet: Significant decrease in debt ratiosA cost of debt that remains under controlGross financial debt was €1.8 billion as at June 30  2024. Including available cash and cash equivalent at the end of June 2024 for €63 million  net debt was also close to €1.8 billion.On a backdrop of interest rates that were still at a high level in the first half of 2024  the average cost of debt as at June 30  2024 was stable at 2.3 %  for a maturity of 5.5 years. Our Group is now expecting a cost of debt stabilising at 2.3% for 2024 based on a 3-month Euribor forecast of close to 4% on the full-year.The cost of debt over the half-year thus remained contained with the following breakdown:58 % fixed-rate debt;39 % of hedged variable debt ;; Only 3% variable rate debt that is not hedged.Significant decrease in debt ratiosOur net debt level as at June 30  2024  led to a net EPRA LTV (net financial debt/appraised value excluding duties) that recorded a significant 4-point decrease at 45.9%  well below our bond’s covenant (65%)  and the net debt / EBITDA8 ratio decreased to 9.5x from 11.0x at the end of December 2023.Successful capital increase in an amount of €150 millionOn top of reflecting a maintained solid portfolio valuation at a Prime level for Argan  the decrease in netEPRA LTV ratio in the first half also testifies to the positive impact of the capital increase9 made in April in an amount of €150 million through an ABB process (at a price per share of €74).With this capital increase  and building on a strategy that aims at not subscribing any additional debt until 2026  Argan has set the following main targets:A strong decrease in its net EPRA LTV ratio from 50% at the end of 2023 to around 44% at the end of 2024; andBringing down its net debt/EBITDA ratio to around 9.5x at the end of 2024  from 11x at the endof 2023.Argan also plans to leverage this equity increase to continue its development  targeting a CAGR of its rental income of +7% over the 2024-2026 period  and to increase the liquidity of its share on the stock market  with the free float having increased from 44% to 48% of the company's capital.€78 million in targeted assets sales for 2024Additionally  and in support of its debt reduction policy  Argan is deploying an assets sales program in an amount of about €180 million for the 2024-2026 period and plans to achieve around €78 million in 2024  with:€18 million already finalized with the disposal – in the second quarter – of a logistics platform inCaen (14) of 18 000 sq.m ; andwith the of a in of ; and The remaining amount of about €60 million planned over the second half of 2024.*********************2024 financial calendar (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)October 1: Net sales of 3rd quarter 20242025 financial calendar (Publication of the press release after closing of the stock exchange)January 3: Net sales of 4 th quarter 2024quarter 2024 January 16: Annual results 2024March 20: General Assembly 2025About ARGANARGAN is the only French real estate company specializing in the DEVELOPMENT & RENTAL OF PREMIUM WAREHOUSES listed on EURONEXT and is the leading player of its market.

This has led us to reduce our exposure to certain contracts whose profitability no longer meets group standards  especially in the telecommunication markets in France and Spain. Although our deployment activities in Benelux remain very promising  they have been delayed due to a ‘wait-and-see’ attitude from telecom service providers  who are discussing how they could rationalize their investments  under the regulator’s guidance. Having passed the billion-euro revenue mark  Solutions30 now manages its business portfolio with a greater focus on profitability and cash generation. To this end  we are continuing to focus our development efforts on businesses that promise attractive growth and margins.”Solutions30’s consolidated revenue amounted to €252.0 million in the second quarter of 2024  down -4.5% compared to the same quarter in 2023  including an organic decline of -4.7% and an impact from acquisitions of +0.2% (the exchange rate effect is negligible).For the first half of 2024  revenue remained stable overall (-0.4%) compared with the same period in 2023  with a very slight organic decline of -0.7% and a +0.3% impact from acquisitions.BeneluxThe Benelux  the group’s largest region in terms of sales (38% of the total in Q2 2024)  reported revenue of €96.1 million  a slight decrease of -1.1% (purely organic) compared to the same period last year  which had an exceptionally high growth rate of 87.7%.Revenue from Connectivity solutions decreased by -3.7% to €75 million. After an extremely active year in 2023 (+108% in Q2 2023)  Solutions30 kept its fiber-optic activities in Belgium at a high level. The impact from the federal elections held in June was minimal thanks to appropriate planning. However  deployment activities were delayed in the second quarter due to a wait-and-see attitude on the part of Belgian telecom service providers  who are in negotiations to streamline deployments across the country. Business prospects in Belgium remain excellent  with a sales pipeline worth around €330 million  providing excellent visibility for the teams in place.Energy solutions continue to grow  with revenue up +9.2% in Q2 2024  reaching €15.9 million. This growth is fueled by the deployment of digital meters. The group’s current diversification into low-voltage electrical grid services and photovoltaics represents an additional reserve of profitable future growth  as demonstrated by the recent contract won from Fluvius to modernize the low-voltage power grid in Flanders (see press release from April 23  2024).Technology solutions posted revenue of €5.2 million in the second quarter of 2024  up +9.5%.For the first six months of the year  Benelux revenue totaled €196.8 million  up 9.4% on a purely organic basis.FranceIn France  revenue for the second quarter of 2024 amounted to €90.7 million (36% of the total)  down -7.2%  including an organic decline of -7.8% and the +0.6% impact from the acquisition of Elec-ENR  consolidated from July 2023.Revenue from Connectivity solutions amounted to €60.2 million  down -13.6% compared to the same quarter in 2023. Amid a slowdown in the connection market  Solutions30 is enforcing strict selectivity  further prioritizing margins and cash generation over volume. To that end  the Group has significantly reduced its exposure to certain contracts whose margins no longer met group standards.Revenue from Energy Solutions continues to grow strongly  up +56% in the second quarter to €15.3 million. Driven by the energy transition  the positive trends related to photovoltaic infrastructure continue. Solutions30 has first-rate expertise in this field  and is gradually establishing itself as a key player. To speed up its growth in the energy sector  the group is actively pursuing its strategy of targeted acquisitions. Following the rapid integration of Elec-ENR  Solutions30 has just won its first joint contract with So-Tec  in which the group acquired a stake in May 2024 (see press release from May 16  2024)  illustrating the potential for commercial synergies with this company.Revenue from Technology solutions is down -16.6% to €15.3 million. The decline in IT support volumes continued in the second quarter. The 2024 Olympics in Paris should provide a growth driver for the third quarter  with Solutions30 present at several Olympic venues to provide technical support for IT and payment systems.For the first six months  revenue in France amounted to €188.6 million  down -5.4% (-6.3% organic).Other CountriesIn other countries  the group posted revenue of €65.1 million in the second quarter of 2024  down -5.4% organically  and stable excluding Italy.In Germany  the ramp-up of fiber activities has begun  and growth accelerated sharply in the second quarter  to +36%. Revenue amounted to €19.7 million  making Germany this geographical segment’s leading contributor. Solutions30 continues to invest in this promising market  which is set to become its third pillar in Europe. Following the acquisition of Gaertner’s activities (see today’s press release)  the group will extend its connection and maintenance capabilities  notably with Deutsche Telekom.Solutions30 continues its successful expansion in Poland  where revenue totaled €13.9 million  up +15.2%  thanks to solid positioning in a fast-growing market for the fiber business.In Italy  revenue amounted to €13.9 million  down -21%  as anticipated. Since the second half of 2023  the Group has voluntary slowed down its operations with its main fiber customer. Negotiations with this customer have reached a positive outcome  and a return to normal business - with more favorable economic conditions - is expected during the third quarter.In Spain  revenue is down -27% to €10.4 million. The high priority placed on margins over volumes has led Solutions30 to reduce its exposure to this country’s mature fiber market. In the second quarter  the group decided not to renew a contract whose margins no longer met group standards.Finally  revenue in the United Kingdom fell by 31% to €7.3 million  again reflecting increased selectivity and a focus on improving profitability.For the first half of the year  total revenue from the “Other Countries” segment amounted to €131.6 million  down -5.8%.OutlookIn a market environment expected to remain mixed across regions in the second half of the year  Solutions30 intends to keep prioritizing margins over volumes in its most mature markets  and reallocating resources to markets with promising opportunities for profitable growth.Thus  the selectivity decisions made in the second quarter regarding certain telecom contracts in France and Spain will continue to translate into lower revenue from those businesses.At the same time  the strong growth seen in the Energy solutions business  especially in France  and the ramp up of fiber deployments in Germany are expected to continue. Business in Italy is expected to return to normal in the third quarter  under improved economic conditions.After a year of very high growth in 2023  business in the Benelux region is expected to remain strong  though it may slow temporarily due to ongoing discussions among telecom service providers about pooling their investments and  to a lesser extent  the electoral context.For 2024 as a whole  Solutions30 now forecasts a slight decrease in revenue compared with 2023.Solutions30 maintains its forecast of an improvement in the group’s adjusted EBITDA margin compared with 2023  translating into an increase in adjusted EBITDA.Webcast for investors and analystsDate: Wednesday  July 24  202418:30 (CET) – 17:30 (GMT)SpeakersGianbeppi Fortis  Chief Executive OfficerJonathan Crauwels  Chief Financial OfficerAmaury Boilot  Group General SecretaryConnection detailsWebcast in English: https://channel.royalcast.com/solutions30-en/#!/solutions30-en/20240724_1Upcoming events2024 HY Earnings Report September 18  2024Capital Markets Day September 26  2024About Solutions30 SESolutions30 provides consumers and businesses with access to the key technological advancements that are shaping our everyday lives  especially those driving the digital transformation and energy transition.

Another interesting 'chart of the day' from Deutsche Bank (ETR:DBKGn)'s macro strategy team has dropped into the inbox ,"Proactive Investors -drops 40 points to 8 114Results out from AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: )  Unilever (LON: )  BAT (LON: )  Lloyds (LON: )(LON: )  BAT (LON: )  Lloyds (LON: ) ...and BT (LON: )  Vodafone (LON: )   Centrica (LON: )  Airtel  Rentokil (LON: )  Mitchells & Butler and moreUS futures in the redFutures markets are eyeing an extension of the US tech sell-off when trading starts in just over an hour.are down 0.35%  while those for the S&P 500 are 0.24% lower and are down less than 0.1%. are flat.Tesla and Nvidia (NASDAQ: ) shares are down over 1% premarket  while Apple (NASDAQ: )  Microsoft (NASDAQ: )  Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) and Meta Platforms are all down around 0.5%.Chart of the day from DBAnother interesting 'chart of the day' from Deutsche Bank (ETR: )'s macro strategy team has dropped into the inbox  looking at the rotation in stock sectors.The analysts noted that in the 1999-2000 tech bubble  fom the peak until the end of 2000  there was a ""ginormous rotation"" into defensive sectors like consumer staples  utilities and healthcare  up 35 percentage points to 45% in the nine months after the bubble burst  while tech fell over 50%.Today’s chart shows the rotation from the current tech sell-off  which started on July 11 (the blue bars show the 10 top-level S&P 500 sectors and the red bars show four broader indices).Since then  the S&P 500 has dropped 3.7%  even though seven out of ten sectors are higher over this period  the DB team point out  led by utilities and healthcare again.Amid yesterday's big tech sell-off  which was the first 2% fall for the S&P 500 in over a year  utilities rose 1.2% and healthcare 0.8% among four sectors that rose.Small and mid-caps are also part of this rotation  with the falling 2.1% yesterday  but still up over 7% since the opening bell on July 11.""So the conclusion is that if tech continues to correct  we should see decent up moves in other sectors  especially as the size of tech dwarfs other sectors. So even a small rotation out of tech could mean a big rotation into other sectors.""Univeral Music  Stellantis and Nissan all crashLooking overseas  the biggest faller in Europe is Universal Music Group (AS: )  where shares have breakdanced 27% lower after the record label colossus reported slower growth than expected in subscriptions as streaming revenues were hit by the TikTok standoff between January and May.The Amsterdam-based group  which represents acts including Taylor Swift  Adele and warring rappers Drake and Kendrick Lamar  reported revenues up 8.7% to €2.9 billion  though recorded music subscription revenue of 6.5% was lower than analysts had forecast  as streaming revenue fell 4.2%.In the car industry  profits at giant manufacturers Stellantis NV (LON: ) and Nissan both plummeted  coming two days after the disappointing Tesla results.Shares Nissan fell 7% in Tokyo and Stellantis 9% on the Euronext.Stellantis  maker of Peugeot  Fiat and Jeep vehicles  reported a 48% fall in profit  which was much worse than expected.In the car industry  profits at giant manufacturers Stellantis and Nissan both plummeted  coming days after the disappointing Tesla results.Shares Nissan fell 7% in Tokyo and Stellantis 9% on the Euronext.Stellantis  maker of Peugeot  Fiat and Jeep vehicles  reported a 48% fall in profit  which was much worse than expected.At Nissan  operating profits crashed from Yen 128.6 billion to just Yen 1.0 billion in its fiscal first quarter  leading the Japanese giant to cut its full-year outlook  even though it expects an improvement in the second half from launches of new models.Stellantis’s finance chief Natalie Knight said: “What has been happening on the industry side and competitiveness has been faster and more difficult than we expected this year  and the transition has been bumpier.""UK car production dropsUK car sales were out earlier but got missed amid the deluge of company results.Production of new petrol  diesel and electric cars all fell in the first half of the year  with total UK car production down 7.6%  according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).Just over 416 000 vehicles rolled out of factories in the six months to the end of June  down 34 094 on the same period in 2023.June saw a 26.6% decline due to various model changes as carmakers bring out more electric vehicles  as reflected in the reports from car companies this week.""The UK auto industry is moving at pace to build the next generation of electric vehicles – a transition that can be a growth engine for the entire British economy "" says Mike Hawes  SMMT chief executive.But the SMMT called on the government to halve VAT on new battery electric cars for three years  estimating it will increase sales by 250 000 units  to exempt EVs from the 'expensive vehicle' supplement excise duty that applies to cars costing more than £40 000.It also wants to equalise VAT on vehicle charging  with a 5% paid by consumers at home versus the 20% levied at on-street charging points.China rate cut fails to move needleEarlier  China's central bank surprised markets for a second time this week with another monetary stimulus for its struggling economy  while Beijing administrators also announced new subsidies for trading in vehicles  with larger payments for EVs.Another interest rate cut was made by the People’s Bank of China  though it does not seem to be helping market sentiment.The one-year loan rate was cut by 20 basis points after the PBOC cut the short-term rate earlier this week.Julian Evans-Pritchard at Capital Economics says the PBOC’s decision to cut interest rates is ""unusual for two reasons"": being double the size of its usual adjustments and that normally adjustments to rates are done on the 15 of each month.""So the PBOC made a conscious decision not to wait until the middle of August to carry out the latest cut "" he says  suggesting ""something looks to have changed"" in policymakers' thinking since Monday.""Our best guess is that they had intended to wait and do a 10bp cut next month but that the underwhelming market response to the Third Plenum and Monday’s rate cuts pushed them to act with greater urgency.""Read more on Proactive Investors UKDisclaimer",neutral,0.01,0.81,0.18,mixed,0.05,0.15,0.81,True,English,"['London stocks', 'three-month

The VanEck Smart Home Active UCITS ETF (CAVE) will delist from the London Stock Exchange  Euronext Amsterdam  Deutsche Börse  Borsa Italiana  SIX Swiss Exchange and Euronext Dublin on 20 August.In a shareholder notice  the firm said the ETF’s investment advisor Dasym's decision to terminate the agreement prompted a review of the ETF's viability.VanEck said the assets under management (AUM) of the ETF have “been below the expectations since the fund was launched on 5 November 2021” and “have considered the viability of the fund in light of the ‘value for money’ principles”.Since its launch  CAVE has amassed $2.9m AUM with a total expense ratio of 0.85%.Actively managed  CAVE captures 44 companies that buy into the smart home megatrend  with the top three holdings being Amazon (4.5%)  Check Point Software Technologies (3.8%) and Nestle (3.5%).It comes amid a flurry of ETF closures such as the iShares J.P.

This service is set to significantly enhance the speed of order transmission  offering unparalleled latency improvements.Stéphane Boujnah  Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Managing Board of Euronext  said:“In the second quarter of 2024  Euronext reached record revenue and income of €412.9 million. Strong organic growth in our non-volume related businesses  combined with dynamic trading activities across asset classes drove the Group’s revenue growth to +12.2%. Combined with continued cost control  this record performance led to a +18.8% increase in adjusted EBITDA  to €256.8 million  and to a 62.2% adjusted EBITDA margin. As a result of this strong performance  our reported net profit grew +18.2% to €141.7 million and adjusted net profit grew +15.6% to €165.2 million. This represents an adjusted EPS of €1.59  increasing +19.0% compared to last year.Over the past few months  we pursued the diversification of our business model with the closing of the acquisition of GRSS  a leading benchmark administrator  in June 2024. This bolt-on acquisition will further strengthen Euronext’s non-volume related revenue growth. We also continued to innovate with the launch of the Euronext Wireless Network  our new microwave service. With this new offering  we became the first exchange in Europe to offer “Plug & Play” order entry in London via microwave technology  which will significantly enhance the speed of order transmission and offer unparalleled improvements in latency.We are now delivering on the final milestone of the Borsa Italiana Group integration. On 15 July 2024  we successfully completed the first phase of the derivatives clearing migration with the migration of our commodity derivatives clearing activities to Euronext Clearing. Financial derivatives will follow in September 2024. With this strategic expansion of our clearing house  Euronext is creating an integrated market infrastructure that further contributes to the defragmentation of the European post-trade landscape  and serves as a catalyst for innovation for its clients. This milestone will also be the final step in reaching the targeted €115 million of run-rate EBITDA synergies by the end of 2024.”Q2 2024 financial performanceIn €m  unless stated otherwiseThe figures in this document have not been audited or reviewed by our external auditor.

Euronext is the first exchange in Europe to offer “Plug & Play” order entry in London via microwave technology. This service is set to significantly enhance the speed of order transmission between London  UK  and Bergamo  Italy  where Euronext’s core data centre is located  offering unparallelled improvements in latency for Euronext’s many London-based members.The Euronext Wireless Network (EWiN) is a fully resilient service with 100% fibre back-up  providing order submission via microwaves from London Equinix LD4 to Bergamo Aruba IT3 in less than 4 milliseconds. This new service is provided in collaboration with McKay Brothers  the largest independent microwave network provider in Europe.The EWiN microwave network represents a major technological advancement in the financial services sector. By leveraging the faster transmission speeds of microwave technology  EWiN provides a direct and highly efficient communication pathway that significantly reduces the time it takes to send orders to Euronext’s single liquidity pool  powered by the single technology platform Optiq®.EWiN combines several key benefits  providing Euronext members with a technological edge in the fast-paced world of financial trading. The service has been designed with full straight-through processing (STP). EWiN also has full fibre back-up  making it 100% resilient. EWiN significantly reduces latency  ensuring faster and more reliable order execution. Lastly  it creates a direct microwave link between London and Bergamo  two major financial data hubs in Europe. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have confirmed the deployment of the new technology since its go-live date.AgendaA conference call and webcast will be held on 26 July 2024  at 09:00 CEST (Paris time) / 08:00 BST (London time):Conference call:To connect to the conference call  please dial:UK Number: +44 33 0551 0200 NO Number: +47 2 156 3318 FR Number: +33 1 70 37 71 66 PT Number: +351 3 0880 2081 NL Number: +31 20 708 5073 IR Number: +353 1 436 0959 US Number: +1 786 697 3501 IT Number: +39 06 8336 0400 BE Number: +32 2 789 8603 DE Number: +49 30 3001 90612Password: EuronextLive webcast:For the live audio webcast go to: Euronext Results webcastThe webcast will be available for replay after the call at the webcast link and on the Euronext Investor Relations webpage.ANALYSTS & INVESTORS – ir@euronext.com Investor Relations Aurélie Cohen +33 1 70 48 24 27 ir@euronext.com Clément Kubiak +33 1 70 48 24 27 ir@euronext.com MEDIA – mediateam@euronext.com EuropeAurélie Cohen +33 1 70 48 24 45 mediateam@euronext.comAndrea Monzani +39 02 72 42 62 13 Amsterdam Marianne Aalders +31 20 721 41 33 amsterdampressoffice@euronext.com Brussels Marianne Aalders +32 26 20 15 01 brusselspressoffice@euronext.com Dublin Andrea Monzani +39 02 72 42 62 13 dublinpressoffice@euronext.com Lisbon Sandra Machado +351 91 777 68 97 portugalpressoffice@euronext.com Milan  Rome Ester Russom +39 02 72 42 67 56 italypressoffice@euronext.com Oslo Cathrine Lorvik Segerlund +47 41 69 59 10 oslopressoffice@euronext.com Paris  Corporate Flavio Bornancin-Tomasella +33 1 70 48 24 45 parispressoffice@euronext.com Corporate Services Coralie Patri +33 7 88 34 27 44 parispressoffice@euronext.comAbout EuronextEuronext is the leading pan-European market infrastructure  connecting European economies to global capital markets  to accelerate innovation and sustainable growth.

Consequently  costs previously reported as exceptional items have from Q1 2023 been included in their respective lines within Euronext operating expenses as non-recurring items.The €150 million of implementation costs to deliver on the ‘Growth for Impact 2024’ strategic plan targets are therefore considered as non-recurring items and have been withdrawn from the underlying recurring costs.The computation of adjusted net income and earnings per share has been adjusted accordingly. The computation of reported net income and earnings per share is not impacted.2024 strategic plan targets remain unchanged and are not affected by this change in reporting.The non-IFRS indicators are defined below.Non-IFRS financial measuresFor comparative purposes  the company provides unaudited non-IFRS measures including:Operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation  underlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation;EBITDA  EBITDA margin  adjusted EBITDA  adjusted EBITDA margin.Non-IFRS measures are defined as follows:Operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation as the total of salary and employee benefits  and other operational expenses;Underlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation as the total of salary and employee benefits  and other operational expenses  excluding non-recurring costs;Underlying revenue and income as the total of revenue and income  excluding non-recurring revenue and income;Non-underlying items as items of revenue  income and expense that are material by their size and/or that are infrequent and unusual by their nature or incidence are not considered to be recurring in the normal course of business and are classified as non-underlying items on the face of the income statement within their relevant category in order to provide further understanding of the ongoing sustainable performance of the Group. These items can include: integration or double run costs of significant projects  restructuring costs and costs related to acquisitions that change the perimeter of the Group; one-off finance costs  gains or losses on sale of subsidiaries and impairments of investments: amortisation and impairment of intangible assets which are recognised as a result of acquisitions and mostly comprising customer relationships  brand names and software that were identified during purchase price allocation (PPA); tax related to non-underlying items.Adjusted operating profit as the operating profit adjusted for any non-underlying revenue and income and non-underlying costs  including PPA of acquired businesses;EBITDA as the operating profit before depreciation and amortisation;Adjusted EBITDA as the adjusted operating profit before depreciation and amortisation adjusted for any non-underlying operational expenses excluding depreciation and amortisation;EBITDA margin as EBITDA divided by total revenue and income;Adjusted EBITDA margin as adjusted EBITDA  divided by total revenue and income;Adjusted net income  as the net income  share of the parent company shareholders  adjusted for any non-underlying items and related tax impact.Non-IFRS financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable IFRS measures and should be read only in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements.Non-volume related revenue definitionNon-volume related revenue includes Listing excl.
