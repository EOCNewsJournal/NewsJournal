The European Union is sending Ukraine €1.5 billion ($1.6 billion) from the proceeds of Russian assets frozen in the EU  to be spent on defence and reconstruction  von der Leyen announces on X. Philipp von Ditfurth/dpaThe European Commission announced on Friday that the European Union is making available €1.5 billion ($1.6 billion) to fund Ukraine's defence and reconstruction  financed by the proceeds of Russian assets frozen in the EU.""There is no better symbol or use for the Kremlin’s money than to make Ukraine and all of Europe a safer place to live "" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen posted on X.Most of the money - 90% of it - will be used to reimburse EU countries for military aid they send to Ukraine  while the remaining 10% will be paid directly to Ukraine as financial aid for reconstruction.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said ""such steps by the European Commission will not go unanswered.""EU foreign ministers approved the payments in late June. Germany and the Czech Republic were selected as the first to use the proceeds to provide Ukraine with air-defence equipment and artillery shells  diplomats said at the time.EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell said on X that ""the EU will stand by Ukraine for as long as it takes."" He noted that the €1.5 billion in aid will fund ""military capabilities and reconstruction.""The aid is financed by the proceeds - such as interest - from Russian Central Bank assets in the EU  but not by the underlying assets themselves  which remain frozen.""The immobilisation of the Russian Central Bank's assets is a result of EU sanctions against Russia  adopted in the wake of its war of aggression against Ukraine "" a commission statement said on Friday.""The extraordinary revenues generated in this context by the EU operators do not belong to Russia and are held by CSDs "" or central securities depositories. ""The EU has now started to channel these revenues to Ukraine.""The money has until this week been held by Brussels-based financial institution Euroclear. On Tuesday  Euroclear made it available to the commission  which in turn released it for Ukraine aid on Friday  the commission's statement said.The money is one of two sources of funding from outside of the EU budget that the bloc wants to use to fund Ukraine's defence. The EU budget itself cannot be spent on weapons of war.The other source is the Ukraine Assistance Fund (UAF)  a pot now worth more than €6 billion under the European Peace Facility (EPF)  an off-budget military aid fund paid into by EU member states.However  every member state has a veto over the EPF  and Hungary - which opposes arming Ukraine - is blocking the EPF payments  despite having allowed the creation of a dedicated budget for Ukraine under the EPF.Similarly  delicate legal footwork was needed to overcome Hungarian opposition to the use of the proceeds from the frozen Russian assets.The foreign ministers' approval of the actual payments in June followed an earlier agreement  in May  to the principle of using the proceeds to buy arms for Ukraine.A legal analysis concluded that because Hungary abstained on the May decision and the money is not from the EU budget  Budapest's veto did not apply to the decision in June.Gergely Gulyás  an aide to Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán  on Friday accused Ukraine of ""blackmailing"" Hungary because of its ""pro-peace stance"" by preventing oil deliveries to the country  according to an X post by the Orbán government's communications chief  Zoltán Kovács.According to the European Commission  around €210 billion worth of Russian Central Bank assets are frozen in the EU.

You'll have access to summary articles written by ...,EQS-News: Haier Smart Home Co. Ltd. / Key word(s): DividendHaier Smart Home Co.  Ltd.: Dividend announcement26.07.2024 / 16:00 CET/CESTThe issuer is solely responsible for the content of this announcement.Haier Smart Home Co.  Ltd.Qingdao  Shandong Province  People's Republic of ChinaDividend announcementThe Annual General Meeting of the company held on June 20  2024  resolved to pay for each D registered common share adividend per share of EUR 0.1043413 grossdividend per share of EUR 0.0939072 less 10% withholding tax in Chinapayable from August 16  2024for financial year 2023. Those shareholders for whom shares in the company will be booked on August 15  2024  (date of record) are entitled to a dividend.The exchange rate of 1 EUR = 7.6797 RMB is based on the average exchange rate of a week immediately prior to the Annual General Meeting.The shares of the company will be listed in the sub-segment of the regulated market with additional post-admission obligations on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (Prime Standard) from August 16  2024 “ex-dividend.”The payment of the dividend via Clearstream Banking AG is generally subject to the deduction of Chinese withholding tax of 10%. The Chinese withholding tax can generally be credited against the German income tax payable on Chinese income or be deductible for tax purposes when determining income.A domestic entity paying out the investment income (i.e.  as a rule  the respective custodian) will generally pay the dividends of a company domiciled in the People’s Republic of China to the shareholder  who is subject to unlimited tax liability in Germany  subject to the deduction of German withholding tax (final withholding tax). The withholding tax is generally 25% plus a solidarity surcharge of 5.5% (effective tax rate thus 26.375%) and  if applicable  plus church tax (depending on the individual’s religious denomination and state of residence). The gross dividend serves as the basis of assessment for the capital gains tax.The domestic paying agent is always obliged to deduct capital gains tax if the shareholders have not submitted a so-called non-assessment certificate or a so-called exemption order. Whether the dividend is actually taxable for the shareholder is irrelevant for the deduction of capital gains tax. It is therefore possible to refrain from deducting tax if  among other criteriathe creditor of the investment income is a natural person with unlimited tax liability and this person proves to the domestic paying agent by submitting the original of a valid non-assessment certificate that he or she will probably not be assessed for income tax;the creditor of the investment income is a natural person with unlimited tax liability and has issued a valid exemption order. An exemption order is the creditor’s private written order to the withholding agent not to deduct capital gains tax up to the tax-free maximum amount of EUR 1 000 (or EUR 2 000 in the case of married couples/partners in life assessed jointly);the creditor of the investment income is a tax-exempt corporation or a domestic legal entity under public law;in the case of the creditor of the investment income  this is part of the business income and the investment income tax in the case of the creditor of the investment income would permanently be higher than the total income or corporation tax to be assessed due to the nature of its business. This must be proven by a certificate from the tax office responsible for the creditor;the creditor of the investment income is a corporation  association of persons or estate subject to unlimited tax liability in Germany that serves tax-privileged purposes. This could apply to associations  for example. The tax concession must be evidenced by a certificate from the tax office responsible for the creditor.For the individual requirements in each case  reference is made here to the provisions of German tax law (esp. Sec. 43 (2)  (3) in conjunction with Sec. 44a of the German Income Tax Act (EStG)). If it is not possible to withhold German withholding tax  the withholding agent  i.e. the domestic paying agent  must check whether the Chinese withholding tax levied in the amount of the withholding tax right under the German-Chinese double taxation agreement can be credited directly against the withholding tax in the withholding procedure. This possibility only exists insofar as the dividends are counted as income from capital assets  which is the case in particular for natural persons with shareholdings as private assets (Section 43a (3) sentence 1 EStG; BMF dated January 18  2016  BStBl. I 2016  p. 85  para. 202 in conjunction with the BMF dated March 31  2022  BStBl. I 2022  p. 328  para. 3). According to the overview of the Federal Central Tax Office (“BZSt”) on the rates of creditable foreign withholding taxes  the creditable Chinese withholding tax amounts to 10% if there is no exemption. If the Chinese withholding tax is credited against the capital gains tax by the paying agent  the capital gains tax will only be credited in the amount of the difference to a tax deduction of 25%. If the crediting of the Chinese withholding tax on the capital gains tax by the paying agent is not possible  the foreign tax cannot be credited in the deduction procedure at the level of the paying agent. The shareholder then has the option of obtaining relief in the assessment procedure.The taxation of dividends for persons with unlimited tax liability in Germany can be summarized as follows:1. Natural persons who hold the D shares as part of their private assets for tax purposes:The gross dividend is generally subject to the special final withholding tax rate (25% plus the solidarity surcharge of 5.5% and church tax  if applicable). The tax liability is deemed to be satisfied by the proper deduction of the capital gains tax.In the context of the assessment  there is an option to tax the gross dividend at the standard tax rate via the so-called favorable tax assessment. In this case  the reduced German capital gains tax pursuant to Sec. 43a (3) sentence 1 EStG is to be credited without limitation against the income tax within the scope of Sec. 36 EStG. The Chinese withholding tax taken into account in the capital gains tax deduction via Sec. 43a (3) sentence 1 EStG is to be credited against the additional standard income tax payable on the added capital income (Section 32d (6) sentence 2 EStG).Actual income-related expenses are not deductible. For this purpose  the shareholder is granted a lump-sum savings allowance of EUR 1 000 or  in the case of married couples/partners in life assessed jointly  of EUR 2 000.2. Natural persons who hold the D Shares as business assets for tax purposes or through a commercial partnership:The gross dividends are taxable at 60% under the partial income method. Related business expenses can be claimed at a tax-reducing rate of 60%.The German capital gains tax levied is creditable against income tax without limitation; even a refund is possible if no income tax is due (Sec. 36 (4) EStG).The Chinese withholding tax  which is not subject to any further reduction  must be credited against the income tax attributable to the foreign income from China within the limits of Sec. 34c EStG (so-called per-country-limitation  Sec. 68a EStDV). Thus  business expenses in economic connection with the dividend reduce the credit volume. If no income tax arises (e.g. due to domestic losses)  the Chinese withholding tax is not creditable; no refund is possible. Upon application  a tax deduction is possible in the tax return instead of a credit when determining the income.For trade tax purposes  dividends are generally recognized at 100% if the shareholding (in the nominal capital) was less than 15% at the beginning of the assessment period (January 1).3. Corporate income tax entities (including corporations subject to corporate income tax):In the case of corporate income tax entities  the gross dividend is generally fully subject to corporate income tax  unless the participation was 10% or more at the beginning of the calendar year. If the participation comprises 10% or more  the gross dividends are effectively 95% exempt from corporate income tax.Operating expenses in connection with the dividends can generally be taken into account.The German capital gains tax withheld and remitted by the paying agent can always be credited against corporate income tax; even a refund is possible if no corporate income tax is due (Sec. 36 (4) EStG).The Chinese withholding tax  which is no longer subject to a reduction claim  must be credited against the corporate income tax attributable to the foreign income from China within the limits of Sec. 26 of the German Corporate Income Tax Act (KStG) in conjunction with Sec. 34c of the German Income Tax Act (EStDV) (the so-called per-country-limitation  Sec. 68a of the German Income Tax Ordinance (EStDV)). Thus  business expenses in economic connection with the dividend reduce the credit volume. If no corporate income tax arises (e.g. due to domestic losses)  the Chinese withholding tax is not creditable; no refund is possible. Upon application  a tax deduction is possible in the tax return instead of a credit when determining the income.For trade tax purposes  dividends must be recognized at 100% if the shareholding (in the nominal capital) was less than 15% at the beginning of the assessment period (January 1).In the case of foreign shareholders not resident in Germany  the Chinese withholding tax may  if applicable  be credited against any tax payable on the dividend in the relevant country in accordance with the national tax regulations of the relevant country or the provisions of a corresponding double taxation treaty.We would like to point out that the above explanations are of an overview nature and can therefore neither be a complete presentation of all national or international tax aspects  nor can they take the particularities of specific individual cases into account.Investors are advised to seek advice from a tax advisor on the specific tax consequences of their investment.Frankfurt/Main  July 2024On behalf of Haier Smart Home Co.

Although Amundi's dividend yield ranks well in the French market  its history of dividend payments over the past eight years shows volatility  casting some uncertainty on future stability. Nonetheless  both earnings and cash flow adequately cover current dividends  with recent financial performance suggesting modest ongoing earnings growth.ENXTPA:AMUN Dividend History as at Jul 2024Simply Wall St Dividend Rating: ★★★★☆☆Overview: Eiffage SA operates in various sectors including construction  property and urban development  civil engineering  metallic construction  roadwork  energy systems  and concessions both in France and internationally with a market cap of approximately €8.59 billion.Operations: Eiffage SA's revenue is primarily generated through its Infrastructures (€8.43 billion)  Energy Systems (€5.99 billion)  Construction (€4.29 billion)  and Concessions (€3.90 billion) segments.Dividend Yield: 4.5%Eiffage  while maintaining a low cash payout ratio of 15.6%  ensures its dividends are well-supported by both earnings and cash flows  with respective payout ratios of 38.5% and 15.6%. Despite a dividend yield of 4.49%  which is below the top quartile in France at 5.35%  Eiffage has shown a commitment to growing dividends  evidenced by an increase over the past decade. However  this growth has been marked by volatility in payments throughout the same period. Recent strategic alliances  such as with Google Cloud to enhance operational efficiency through AI  underline efforts to bolster future capabilities but also reflect ongoing challenges like high debt levels that could impact financial flexibility.Story continuesENXTPA:FGR Dividend History as at Jul 2024Simply Wall St Dividend Rating: ★★★★☆☆Overview: CFM Indosuez Wealth Management SA operates in banking and financial services for private investors  businesses  institutions  and professionals both in Monaco and globally  with a market cap of approximately €0.62 billion.Operations: CFM Indosuez Wealth Management SA generates its revenue primarily through its wealth management segment  which accounted for €196.38 million.Dividend Yield: 7.4%CFM Indosuez Wealth Management has demonstrated a mixed dividend history with a high yield of 7.41%  placing it in the top 25% in France  yet its dividends have shown volatility and unreliability over the past decade. Despite this  earnings growth was robust at 40.1% last year  and with a payout ratio of 70.8%  dividends are currently supported by earnings. The company's price-to-earnings ratio at €10.2 is attractive compared to the French market average of €15.6  suggesting potential value despite past dividend inconsistencies.ENXTPA:MLCFM Dividend History as at Jul 2024Summing It All UpDelve into our full catalog of 37 Top Euronext Paris Dividend Stocks here.Are these companies part of your investment strategy?

Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; possible failure of products launches; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions; and risks of tax adjustments given the regular audits from tax authorities considering Ipsen’s M&A activities and its presence in multiple geographies. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law. Ipsen’s business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French Autorité des Marchés Financiers.

Tovorafenib has the potential to make a significant impact on children living with cancer and is an excellent example of our biomarker-driven strategy as we expand our portfolio. Pediatric low-grade glioma is the most common form of childhood brain cancer  and  outside the U.S.  there are still no approved targeted treatments for people with pLGG caused by BRAF alterations  including BRAF fusions or V600 in the refractory/relapsed setting. We are delighted to partner with the team at Day One as we work to bring tovorafenib to every eligible patient around the world  who may benefit from this important new treatment option.”Jeremy Bender  Ph.D.  Chief Executive Officer  Day One commented  “Our collaboration with Ipsen to bring tovorafenib to patients worldwide highlights our shared commitment to bring novel therapeutics to patients who have limited treatment options. We believe Ipsen’s footprint in Europe and major regions outside of the U.S.  in addition to their track record of bringing innovative medicines to market in oncology and rare pediatric diseases  will be an enormous benefit to tovorafenib and to the pediatric oncology community worldwide.”Ipsen’s deep heritage and expertise in oncology means we can accelerate the delivery of this innovation as teams focus on regulatory activities outside the U.S. pLGG is the most common brain tumor diagnosed in children  with patients suffering profound tumor- and treatment-associated morbidities that can impact their life trajectory.i Depending on the tumor’s size  location and growth rate  pLGG can present with a variety of symptoms including vision  hearing and speech problems  neurological symptoms  premature puberty  physical changes and generalized symptoms such as balance problems  fatigue and nausea.v Mortality is relatively rare  however due to the chronic nature of pLGG and potential morbidity associated with treatment  the disease can significantly affect the development  cognition  education and overall quality of life of affected children  whilst negatively impacting the mental health of parents and caregivers.vi viiUnder the terms of the agreement  Ipsen will be responsible for the regulatory and commercial activities for tovorafenib in all territories outside of the U.S. Day One will receive an upfront payment of approximately $111 million  which includes approximately $71 million in cash as well as a $40 million equity investment at a premium and up to approximately $350 million in additional launch and sales milestone payments. Day One will receive tiered double-digit royalties starting at mid-teens percentage on sales.ENDSAbout IpsenWe are a global biopharmaceutical company with a focus on bringing transformative medicines to patients in three therapeutic areas: Oncology  Rare Disease and Neuroscience.Our pipeline is fueled by external innovation and supported by nearly 100 years of development experience and global hubs in the U.S.  France and the U.K. Our teams in more than 40 countries and our partnerships around the world enable us to bring medicines to patients in more than 80 countries.Ipsen is listed in Paris (Euronext: IPN) and in the U.S. through a Sponsored Level I American Depositary Receipt program (ADR: IPSEY).

Day One was founded to address a critical unmet need: the dire lack of therapeutic development in pediatric cancer. Inspired by “The Day One Talk” that physicians have with patients and their families about an initial cancer diagnosis and treatment plan  Day One aims to re-envision cancer drug development and redefine what’s possible for all people living with cancer—regardless of age—starting from Day One.Day One partners with leading clinical oncologists  families  and scientists to identify  acquire  and develop important targeted cancer treatments. Day One’s pipeline includes tovorafenib (OJEMDA™)  pimasertib and DAY301.Day One is based in Brisbane  California. For more information  please visit www.dayonebio.com or follow Day One on LinkedIn or X.About tovorafenibTovorafenib (known as OJEMDATM in the U.S.) is a Type II RAF kinase inhibitor mutant BRAF V600  wild-type BRAF  and wild-type CRAF kinases. Tovorafenib is indicated for the treatment of patients 6 months of age and older with relapsed or refractory pediatric low-grade glioma (LGG) harboring a BRAF fusion or rearrangement  or BRAF V600 mutation. This indication is approved under accelerated approval based  in part  on response rate and duration of response according to multiple response assessment criteria: Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology High-Grade Glioma (RANO-HGG) criteria  Response Assessment in Pediatric Neuro-Oncology Low-Grade Glioma (RAPNO LGG) criteria  and Response Assessment for Neuro-Oncology Low-Grade Glioma (RANO LGG) criteria. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial(s).Tovorafenib is under evaluation as a therapy for patients aged 6 months to 25 years with pLGG harboring BRAF fusion or rearrangement  or BRAF V600 mutation requiring front-line treatment (Phase III FIREFLY-2/LOGGIC). It is also being studied in combination with the MEK inhibitor pimasertib for adolescent and adult patient populations with recurrent or progressive solid tumors with MAPK pathway alterations (FIRELIGHT-1).Tovorafenib was granted Breakthrough Therapy and Rare Pediatric Disease designations by the FDA for the treatment of patients with pLGG harboring an activating RAF alteration  and it was evaluated by the FDA under priority review. Tovorafenib has also received Orphan Drug designation from the FDA for the treatment of malignant glioma and from the European Commission for the treatment of glioma.For more information  please visit www.ojemda.com.About FIREFLY-1FIREFLY-1 is evaluating tovorafenib as once-weekly monotherapy in patients aged 6 months to 25 years with relapsed or progressive pLGG harboring a known activating BRAF alteration. The trial is being conducted in collaboration with the Pacific Pediatric Neuro-Oncology Consortium. The pivotal and ongoing Phase II FIREFLY-1 studyv evaluated the safety and efficacy of tovorafenib in 137 relapsed or refractory BRAF-altered pLGG patients  who had received at least one line of prior therapy  across two study arms. Arm 1 (n=77) was used for the efficacy analyses and Arm 2 provided safety data for an additional 60 patients  initiated to enable access to tovorafenib once Arm 1 had fully recruited.ii iii The primary endpoint in Arm 1 of best overall response rate (ORR)  determined by independent radiology review committee (IRC) and based on Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology High-Grade Glioma (RANO-HGG) criteria  achieved ORR of 67% and median time to response (TTR) of 3 months. At the time of data cutoff on 5 June 2023 there was a median duration of response (DOR) of 16.6 months. The secondary endpoint of best ORR by IRC according to Response Assessment in Pediatric Neuro-Oncology Low-Grade Glioma (RAPNO LGG) criteria was 51% with a median DOR of 13.8 months and median TTR of 5.3 months. Among 137 patients (arms 1 and 2)  the most common all-grade treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) were hair color changes (76%)  elevated creatine phosphokinase (56%) and anemia (49%). Grade ≥3 TRAEs occurred in 42% of patients with elevated creatine phosphokinase (12%) and anemia (10%) as the most common. Nine (7%) patients had TRAEs leading to discontinuation of tovorafenib.vi Additional information about FIREFLY-1 may be found at ClinicalTrials.gov  using Identifier NCT04775485.About Pediatric Low-Grade GliomaPediatric low-grade glioma (pLGG) is the most common brain tumor with an estimated US incidence of 1 100 and Europe incidence of 700 children per year who are eligible for front-line systemic therapy.i viii BRAF is the gene most commonly altered in pLGG  which include two primary types of BRAF alterations – a BRAF gene fusion and BRAF point mutation. These BRAF alterations account for >50% of pLGG cases worldwide and until now there were no approved treatments for people with pLGG driven by BRAF fusions.i viPediatric low-grade gliomas can be chronic and relentless  with patients suffering profound side effects from both the tumor and the treatment  which may include chemotherapy and radiation. These side effects can impact their life over the long term  and may include muscle weakness  loss of vision  and difficulty speaking. This type of tumor has a high risk of progression  and many children with pLGG require long-term treatment. While most children with pLGG survive their cancer  children who do not achieve a complete resection following surgery may face years of increasingly aggressive treatment.Ipsen contactsEmail: corporate.communications@ipsen.comInvestorsCraig Marks | + 44 7584 349 193Nicolas Bogler | +33 (0) 6 52 19 98 92MediaAmy Wolf | +41 7 95 76 07 23Jess Smith | + 44 7557 267 634Day One biopharmaceuticals contactsInvestorsPJ Kelleher  LifeSci Advisors pkelleher@lifesciadvisors.comMediaLaura Cooper  Day One media@dayonebio.comDisclaimers and/or Forward-Looking StatementsThe forward-looking statements  objectives and targets contained herein are based on Ipsen’s management strategy  current views and assumptions. Such statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those anticipated herein. All of the above risks could affect Ipsen’s future ability to achieve its financial targets  which were set assuming reasonable macroeconomic conditions based on the information available today. Use of the words ‘believes’  ‘anticipates’ and ‘expects’ and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements  including Ipsen’s expectations regarding future events  including regulatory filings and determinations. Moreover  the targets described in this document were prepared without taking into account external-growth assumptions and potential future acquisitions  which may alter these parameters. These objectives are based on data and assumptions regarded as reasonable by Ipsen. These targets depend on conditions or facts likely to happen in the future  and not exclusively on historical data. Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen’s ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen’s patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen’s activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen’s partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen’s business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law.

It is estimated that 6 660 new cases of ALL and 1 560 deaths related to the disease occurred in the US in 20222.Mark Frattini  M.D.  Ph.D.  Chief Medical Officer at Cellectis said: “We are excited that the FDA granted UCART22 both ODD and RPDD Status in the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. This decision represents additional evidence of the potential of UCART22 to bring a much-needed therapeutic option to these patients with ALL. There is an urgent need to develop new therapies for ALL for patients who are not candidates for HSCT or relapse after CD19 directed CAR T-cell therapies and/or HSCT.”UCART22 is an allogeneic CAR T-cell product candidate targeting CD22 and evaluated in BALLI-01  a Phase 1/2 open-label dose-escalation and dose-expansion study  designed to evaluate the safety  expansion  persistence and clinical activity of UCART22 in patients with relapse/refractory ALL.The last clinical data presented by Cellectis at the American Society of Hematology in December 2023 were encouraging and suggested that UCART22-P2 (fully manufactured at Cellectis) is more potent with a preliminary response rate of 67% at Dose Level 2  compared to a 50% response rate at Dose Level 3 with UCART22-P1 (manufactured by an external CDMO). Cellectis expects to provide updates on the progress of BALLI-01 by year-end 2024.The FDA grants ODD status to medicines intended for the treatment  diagnosis or prevention of rare diseases or disorders that affect fewer than 200 000 people in the US  an RPDD is granted for serious or life-threatening disease in which the serious or life-threatening manifestations  such as mortality with relapsed and/or refractory disease  primarily affect individuals aged from birth to 18 years. Receiving ODD may help to expedite and reduce the cost of development  approval  and commercialization of a therapeutic agent. Receiving RPDD may lead to receiving a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher at the time of marketing approval.About CellectisCellectis is a clinical-stage biotechnology company using its pioneering gene-editing platform to develop life-saving cell and gene therapies.

CARBIOS  (Euronext Growth Paris : ALCRB)  a pioneer in the development and industrialization of biological technologies to reinvent the life cycle of plastic and textiles  and Nouvelles Fibres …,CARBIOS and Nouvelles Fibres Textiles work together towards a contract to supply post-consumer and post-industrial polyester textiles for the world's first PET biorecycling plantThe 5-year contract covers a volume of 5 000 tons per year of prepared polyester textiles from end 2026The two companies combine their innovations to establish a complete ecosystem in France for textile circularityClermont-Ferrand (France)  Thursday 25 July 2024 (6.45am CEST). CARBIOS   (Euronext Growth Paris : ALCRB)  a pioneer in the development and industrialization of biological technologies to reinvent the life cycle of plastic and textiles  and Nouvelles Fibres Textiles  a French company specializing in the recovery of end-of-life textiles  today announce the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding to establish a contract for the supply of polyester textiles to the world's first PET biorecycling plant currently under construction in Longlaville  France. The polyester textiles supplied will come from used or end-of-life textiles prepared in France by Nouvelles Fibres Textiles for recycling using CARBIOS' enzymatic depolymerization technology. This contract will enable 5 000 tons a year of these textiles to be redirected towards biorecycling from 2026 onwards  over an initial 5-year period  demonstrating the commitment of industrial players all along the value chain to achieving textile circularity for a more sustainable textile sector.Nouvelles Fibres Textiles and its various partners opened a unique semi-industrial site with an annual capacity of 1 000 tons in November 2023  the first step towards building a 20 000-to-30 000-ton unit in 2026. This first site  a research center for textile recycling  combines the know-how of Andritz Laroche (world leader in textile recycling)  Pellenc ST (French leader in intelligent sorting solutions)  Synergie TLC (major French player in collection and first sorting for solidarity) and the Tissages de Charlieu group (major French player in weaving  garment manufacturing and textile recycling). This unit transforms used textiles into high-quality raw materials  supplying the various industries that use textile fibers (non-wovens  insulation  plastic  textiles  etc.) by automatically sorting them by composition  while eliminating hard points (buttons  zips  patches  etc.).CARBIOS' biorecycling technology uses enzymes to break down polyester fibers into their basic components. These components are then used to produce high-quality recycled PET materials  such as fibers for the textile industry. This “fiber-to-fiber” solution will enable polyester to become a truly circular fiber on a large scale.Emmanuel Ladent  CEO of CARBIOS : « CARBIOS is known as a biotech company  but we're also a player in the textile industry. We actively collaborate with innovative companies like Nouvelles Fibres Textiles to create a truly circular economy for textiles. As demonstrated in the packaging sector  the introduction of large-scale polyester recycling solutions will catalyze the structuring of collection and preparation infrastructures. Together  Nouvelles Fibres Textiles and CARBIOS demonstrate that the French industry continues to develop  thanks to the complementarity between the various links in the value chain  from collection and preparation to recycling. »Eric Boël and Etienne Wiroth  Co-directors of Nouvelles Fibres Textiles: “The textile industry represents all the excesses of our over-consumption. One of the most ecologically  economically and socially effective responses is the circular economy  because it preserves resources and boosts industrial sovereignty and local employment. But the extraordinary variety of textiles is holding back large-scale deployment. New technologies  such as CARBIOS' enzymatic depolymerization and automated sorting by composition  are overcoming this obstacle. Above all  the links forged between the companies involved in this new circular value chain are helping to make this sector emblematic of an industry that does good for people and the planet  from producer to consumer.”France  a pioneer and European leader in the quest for textile circularityThanks to legislative initiatives such as the AGEC1 (Anti-Waste for a Circular Economy) and “Climat et Résilience2” (Climate and Resilience) laws  support from ADEME3  the Refashion eco-organization  and committed companies contributing to industrial sovereignty by combining innovation  ecological transition  “Made in France” and growth  France is today at the forefront of accelerating a circular economy for textiles.At European Union level  separate collection of textile waste will be mandatory in member states from 1 January 2025. The European Union's strategy for sustainable and circular textiles aims to ensure that  by 2030  textile products are largely made from recycled fibers  and that incineration and landfill are reduced to a minimum4.###About CARBIOS:CARBIOS is a biotech company developing and industrializing biological solutions to reinvent the life cycle of plastic and textiles. Inspired by nature  CARBIOS develops enzyme-based processes to break down plastic with a mission to avoid plastic and textile pollution  and accelerate the transition to a circular economy. Its two disruptive technologies for the biorecycling of PET and the biodegradation of PLA are reaching industrial and commercial scale. Its biorecycling demonstration plant has been operational since 2021 and a first industrial plant  in partnership with Indorama Ventures  is currently under construction. CARBIOS  founded in 2011 by Truffle Capital  has received scientific recognition  notably with the cover of Nature  and is supported by prestigious brands in the cosmetics  Food & Beverage and apparel industries to enhance their products’ recyclability and circularity. Nestlé Waters  PepsiCo and Suntory Beverage & Food Europe are members of a packaging consortium founded by CARBIOS and L’Oréal.

It can automatically sort garments by composition and color  and can also remove hard points and pre-filter garments. At the end of the line  Nouvelles Fibres Textiles produces a secondary raw material designed for industries that use textile fibers (fraying/filting  non-wovens  composite materials  etc.). Together with our partners  ANDRITZ and Pellenc ST  and with all our customers  we carry out production under real conditions and applied industrial research to meet the challenges of recycling and supplying our industries. Nouvelles Fibres Textiles is already laying the foundations for a second material preparation plant by 2026  which will have an annual capacity of 20 to 30 k tonnes of post-consumer textiles and will create around thirty direct jobs.The creation of Nouvelles Fibres Textiles marks another major step forward in reducing the carbon footprint of the textile industry. Automated sorting was the last missing link in France's circular economy loop  which now paves the way for a complete ecosystem bringing together brands  SSE players  collectors-sorters and manufacturers from different sectors  all working together to serve consumers seeking greater traceability and meaning in their donations and purchases.For additional information  please contact:CARBIOS (France) Melissa Flauraud Iconic Relations Presse Aurélie AKNIN melissa.flauraud@carbios.com carbios@iconic.fr +33 (0)6 30 26 50 04 +33 (0)6 68 28 21 78 Contact NFT contact@nouvellesfibrestextiles.comThe translation is provided for information purposes only.In the event of any discrepancy between the French and English versions of this press release  the French version shall prevail.1 https://www.ecologie.gouv.fr/loi-anti-gaspillage-economie-circulaire2 https://www.ecologie.gouv.fr/actualites/loi-climat-resilience-bilan-2-ans3 The French Environment and Energy Management Agency (Agence de l'environnement et de la maîtrise de l'énergie)4 https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/fr/qanda_22_2015Attachments,neutral,0.0,1.0,0.0,mixed,0.42,0.33,0.25,True,English,"['French polyester textile recycling industry', 'Nouvelles Fibres Textiles', 'CARBIOS', 'Tissages de Charlieu group', 'high-quality recycled PET materials', 'first PET biorecycling plant', ""CARBIOS' enzymatic depolymerization technology"", 'large-scale polyester recycling solutions', 'new circular value chain', 'high-quality raw materials', 'Eric Boël', 'European Union level', 'The European Union', 'initial 5-year period', 'unique semi-industrial site', 'intelligent sorting solutions', ""CARBIOS' biorecycling technology"", 'Nouvelles Fibres Textiles', 'Euronext Growth Paris', '20,000-to-30,000-ton unit', 'major French player', 'post-industrial polyester textiles', 'prepared polyester textiles', 'sustainable textile sector', 'first site', 'first step', 'large-scale deployment', 'New technologies', 'biological solutions', 'European leader', 'automated sorting', 'French company', 'French leader', 'circular textiles', 'circular economy', 'textile recycling', 'French industry', 'textile circularity', 'textile waste', 'textile products', 'life textiles', 'complete ecosystem', 'biological technologies', 'life cycle', 'industrial players', 'various partners', 'annual capacity', 'research center', 'Andritz Laroche', 'Pellenc ST', 'garment manufacturing', 'various industries', 'hard points', 'large scale', 'Emmanuel Ladent', 'biotech company', 'packaging sector', 'Etienne Wiroth', 'effective responses', 'industrial sovereignty', 'local employment', 'extraordinary variety', 'legislative initiatives', 'Climat et', 'Résilience2', 'Refashion eco-organization', 'ecological transition', 'member states', 'polyester fibers', 'textile industry', 'circular fiber', '5-year contract', 'textile fibers', 'two companies', 'basic components', 'innovative companies', 'preparation infrastructures', 'various links', 'world leader', 'separate collection', 'post-consumer', 'volume', '5,000 tons', 'end', 'innovations', 'France', 'Clermont-Ferrand', 'Thursday', 'July', 'ALCRB', 'pioneer', 'development', 'industrialization', 'plastic', 'recovery', 'signing', 'Memorandum', 'Understanding', 'supply', 'construction', 'Longlaville', 'commitment', '1,000 tons', 'November', 'know-how', 'Synergie', 'TLC', 'solidarity', 'weaving', 'wovens', 'insulation', 'composition', 'buttons', 'zips', 'patches', 'enzymes', 'CEO', 'introduction', 'structuring', 'complementarity', 'directors', 'excesses', 'consumption', 'economically', 'socially', 'resources', 'obstacle', 'people', 'planet', 'producer', 'quest', 'AGEC1', 'Anti-Waste', 'Climate', 'Resilience', 'laws', 'support', 'ADEME', 'Made', 'forefront', '1 January', 'strategy', 'incineration', 'landfill', 'minimum', 'nature']",2024-07-25,2024-07-26,globenewswire.com

More than 95% of the total target number of patients have been randomized in this trial so far.“I would like to thank our patients  the clinical sites  our internal team and our investors for their efforts and support in enabling us to reach this important milestone  the completion of U.S. recruitment in the Denali trial. We will remain fully focused on NCX 470 and on continuing recruitment of patients in China to complete Denali as we move towards expected topline results in H2 2025.” said Doug Hubatsch  Chief Scientific Officer of Nicox.The Denali trial is evaluating the intraocular pressure (IOP) lowering efficacy of once-daily dosed NCX 470 ophthalmic solution 0.1% compared to latanoprost ophthalmic solution 0.005% in patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. It is a multi-country (U.S. and China) clinical trial financed equally by Nicox and Ocumension  Nicox’s exclusive licensee for China  Korea and Southeast Asia. The Denali trial  together with the Mont Blanc trial  was designed to fulfill the regulatory requirements to support New Drug Application (NDA) submissions of NCX 470 in the U.S. and China. The U.S. NDA for NCX 470 is expected to be submitted in H1 2026.Topline results from the first Phase 3 trial  Mont Blanc  showed the IOP-lowering effect from baseline was 8.0 to 9.7 mmHg for NCX 470 vs. 7.1 to 9.4 mmHg for latanoprost. Statistical non-inferiority was met vs. latanoprost in the primary efficacy analysis and 4 out of 6 timepoints additionally demonstrated superiority; the trial therefore met the efficacy requirements for approval in the U.S. NCX 470 was well tolerated and discontinuation rates were low. The results of the Mont Blanc trial have been published in the prestigious American Journal of Ophthalmology  and numerous post hoc analyses have been presented.

As of June 30th  2024  the Group’s sales totalled €419.2m  up 10.7% compared with the same period in 2023 (€378.6m). Earnings reflected a negative forex effect of €4.1m. At constant exchange rates (CER1)  Guerbet’s growth over the first six months was 11.8%. This trend includes an acceleration in the second quarter (+14.5% at CER)  following what was already a highly positive momentum in the first quarter (+8.8%).Geographical breakdown of consolidated Group revenue (IFRS)In millions of euros at 30 June 2024 H1 2023*H1 2024% changeH1 2024At CER1% changeSales in EMEA 178.5 183.4 +2.7% 182.8 +2.4% Sales in the Americas 98.6 127.3 +29.2% 127.2 +29.1% Sales in Asia 101.5 108.5 +6.8% 113.2 +11.5% Total 378.6 419.2 +10.7% 423.3 +11.8%In the EMEA region  Group revenue amounted to €183.4m in the first half  up 2.4% at CER. The decline in the first quarter (-6.2% at CER) was fully offset in the second (+11.0% at CER) as business returned to normal in France after the disruptions linked to the March 1st 2024 reform of the supply circuit for contrast products.Guerbet revenue in the Americas caught up strongly for the third consecutive quarter  with growth of 37.4% in the second quarter at CER  reflecting record production levels at the Raleigh site in North Carolina. Total H1 revenue in the Americas came out at €127.3m  up 29.1% at CER.Asia posted growth of 6.8% over the period  at €108.5m  including a persistent negative currency effect. At CER  growth totalled 11.5% in the first half  despite a slowdown in the second quarter stemming from the contraction in sales in South Korea  where access to care has been paralysed since mid-February by an unprecedented doctor strike.Breakdown of consolidated Group revenue (IFRS) by activityIn millions of euros at 30 June 2024 H1 2023*H1 2024% changeH1 2024At CER1% changeDiagnostic Imaging 336.5 368.8 +9.6% 372.3 +10.7% MRI 125.0 131.1 +4.8% 131.5 +5.2% X-ray 211.4 237.7 +12.4% 240.8 +13.9% Interventional Imaging 42.2 50.4 +19.5% 50.9 +20.8% Total 378.6 419.2 +10.7% 423.3 +11.8%Diagnostic Imaging revenue amounted to €368.8m in H1 2024  up 10.7% at CER.MRI sales increased 5.2% at CER in the first half of the year thanks to a solid performance in the second quarter (+13.5%). Over this period  business was driven by a strong performance by the MRI franchise  and particularly the development of Elucirem TM in the United States  together with the initial sales in Germany.sales increased 5.2% at CER in the first half of the year thanks to a solid performance in the second quarter (+13.5%). Over this period  business was driven by a strong performance by the MRI franchise  and particularly the development of Elucirem in the United States  together with the initial sales in Germany. X-ray revenue grew 13.9% at CER in H1 2024 as part of a positive business dynamic fuelled by sales of Xenetix® and Optiray®.In Interventional Imaging  revenue at mid-year was up 20.8% at CER. This remarkable performance reflects a strong pick-up in the second quarter (+33.8% at CER) on continued positive momentum for Lipiodol®  in terms both of volumes and prices.Solid visibility for H2 - Confirmation of financial targets for 2024Having achieved a sustained growth trajectory in the first half of the year  Guerbet enters the second half in full peace of mind. Beyond the catch-up in sales in the Americas  business continues to benefit from firmly established growth drivers firmly across the entire portfolio: in X-rays (Optiray® in particular)  Interventional Imaging (strong momentum with Lipiodol®) and the MRI franchise. The latter is now reinforced by the expansion in Europe of EluciremTM  which  after receiving an extremely favourable reception in Germany in Q2 2024  will be launched in in the UK and France in the second half.Guerbet also remains confident in improving its operating profitability  driven by the adjustment of the product mix and price increases  and in its ability to bring cash generation into positive territory.Given these circumstances  the Group is confirming its forecast of sales growth of over 8% in 2024 like-for-like and at CER and expects its adjusted EBITDA margin rate to exceed that of 2021 (14.4%). Free cash flow is expected to be in positive territory for the full year.Next event:Publication of 1st half 2024 results25 September 2024 after market closeAbout GuerbetAt Guerbet  we build lasting relationships so that we enable people to live better.

Sales prices remained stable over the financial year  i.e. -0.2% compared to the first half of 2023.In a declining market  sales in the three flooring divisions were slightly down  particularly in the residential end-user segment. The level of activity in Sports division is stable compared to the record first half of 2023. The currency effect was unfavourable  mainly due to the depreciation of the rouble and the dollar.Adjusted EBITDA in the first half of the year amounted to €148.2 million  i.e. 9.5% of revenue  compared to €126.1 million in the first half of 2023  i.e. 7.8% of revenue.The combined effect of volume and mix was slightly negative at -2 million euros  with a favourable product mix partially offsetting lower volumes.The significant reduction in raw material costs compared to the previous year had a positive effect of +35 million euros over the six months  but wage inflation remained significant (-15 million euros).Selling prices were stable overall at (-0.2% compared to the first half of 2023). Contained and controlled reductions have been implemented for certain products (-4 million euros).SG&A increased slightly by (-8 million euros) to support the growth of Sports and the launch of new collections in flooring.The good industrial performance and productivity actions implemented by the Group enabled a significant reduction in production costs of +17 million euros  which contributed significantly to the improvement in margins over the first half of the year.The adjusted EBITDA margin for the first half of the year improved significantly to 9.5% of sales compared to 7.8% in the first half of 2023.EBIT amounted to €59.9 million in the first half of 2024 up from €48.5 million in 2023. Adjustments to EBIT (detailed in Appendix 1) amounted to €22.0 million in the first half of 2024 compared to €10.7 million in the first half of 2023. They include  in particular  restructuring costs related to the plan to reduce general and administrative costs as well as the rationalisation of the industrial organisation in Europe and the reorganisation of certain central functions.Financial expenses amounted to €27.4 million in the first half of 2024  compared to €33.9 million in the first half of 2023. This decrease is mainly due to lower use of the short-term financing line (“Revolving Credit Facility”). The income tax expense amounted to €13.4 million in 2024  up slightly compared to the previous year (€11.4 million) due to the increase in profits before tax.The Net profit (group share) of the first half of 2024 is €18.0 million  i.e. a diluted earnings per share of €0.27.H1 2024 Revenue and EBITDA by segmentNet revenue per segmentIn millions of euros H1 2024 H1 2023 Change Organic growth (1) EMEA 439.3 443.1 -0.9% -3.7% North America 446.3 458.1 -2.6% -2.2% CIS  APAC & Latin America 243.8 277.8 -12.3% -3.7% Sports 429.3 429.3 +0.0% +0.3% TOTAL 1 558.7 1 608.3 -3.1% -2.2%(1) Selling price adjustments in the CIS countries are historically intended to offset currency movements and are therefore excluded from the “organic growth” indicator (see Appendix 1).Adjusted EBITDA per segmentThe Group’s IT costs were historically reported into central costs. From 2024  they will be reassigned to each business segment according to their actual use of IT services. This approach provides a more accurate reflection of the performance of each segment.As a result  the 2023 adjusted EBITDA of each segment has been restated to allow comparison with 2024. The amount of 2023 IT costs reallocated to the segments is €14.8 million (see reconciliation table in Appendix 1).In millions of euros H1 2024 H1 2023 Proforma Margin2024 Margin2023 EMEA 41.4 30.4 9.4% 6.9% North America 48.0 38.1 10.8% 8 3% CIS  APAC & Latin America 27.8 32.8 11.4% 11.8% Sports 48.6 41.6 11.3% 9.7% Central -17.6 -16.8 - - TOTAL 148.2 126.1 9.5% 7.8%Comments by segmentThe EMEA segment generated revenue of €439 million  slightly down by -0.9% including a favourable currency effect of +0.5% and a scope effect of +2.3% (integration of activities in Ukraine previously linked to CIS) compared to the first half of 2023. The macroeconomic environment  high interest rates and the cost of construction and renovation projects continue to weigh negatively on demand in the eurozone  but also in important markets such as the UK and Northern Europe. In a declining flooring market  the volume of activity is down  particularly in Residential. Some selling prices have been selectively adjusted downwards to support business.The segment’s adjusted EBITDA amounts to €41 million  i.e. 9.4% of sales  compared to €30 million/6.9% of sales in the first half of 2023. The decrease in volumes and the adjustment of certain sales prices were more than offset by the drop in raw material purchase prices compared to the first half of 2023. Industrial productivity helped to offset the rise in wages.The North America segment generated revenue of €446 million  down by -2.6% compared to the first half of 2023  reflecting like-for-like growth of -2.2%. The Commercial segments (Offices  Health and Education) held up well and their volume of activity was slightly up compared to the first half of 2023. In particular  they have benefited from an improvement in carpet tile and LVT volumes. The Residential segment is heavily penalised by inflation and rising mortgage rates  which have led to a sharp reduction in new construction and renovation projects.The segment’s adjusted EBITDA increased significantly to €48 million  i.e.  10.8% of sales  compared to €38 million/8.3% of sales in the first half of 2023. It benefits from the positive inflation balance  the measures to turn around certain business  and the good performance of the production sites.Revenue in the CIS  APAC and Latin America segment amounted to €244 million  down -12.3% compared to the first quarter of 2023  with organic sales falling by -3.7% (excluding sales price effects in CIS countries)  a negative currency effect (-4.9%) mainly linked to the depreciation of the rouble and a scope effect of -3.7% (integration of activities in Ukraine in the EMEA segment). In Russia  against a background that remains complex  volumes are down by -10% compared to 2023. Asia Pacific is driven by good momentum in Australia and most Asian markets. In Latin America  demand remained low and lagged behind considerably compared to the previous year  especially in Brazil.The adjusted EBITDA of the CIS  APAC and Latin America segment is down to €28 million  i.e.  11.4% of sales  compared to €33 million/11.8% of sales in the first half of 2023  mainly due to low volumes in Russia and rising raw material prices in the CIS region. In the first half of the year  Russia accounted for around 8% of Group sales.The Sports segment maintains a strong level of activity with a revenue of €429 million in the first half of 2024  equalling the record level reached in the first half of the previous year. The volume of activity in artificial turf sports fields and athletics tracks in North America is stable and the Group continues to develop its turnkey project offering. Growth at constant exchange rates and scope was +0.3%.The adjusted EBITDA of the Sports segment rose to €49 million  i.e. 11.3% of sales  compared to €42 million/9.7% of sales in the first half of 2023. This improvement is the result of a positive inflation balance due to the good level of sales prices and favourable raw material prices.Balance Sheet and Cash Flow 2024Tarkett recorded a negative change in working capital requirements in the first half of 2024 (€-121.6 million)  in line with the seasonality of the business that requires increasing inventory levels in the first half to meet the peak in demand in the third quarter. The Group continues to implement measures to improve its management of working capital requirements. The inventory levels at the end of June 2024 is slightly lower than at the end of June 2023  but will be sufficient to meet demand in the second half of the year.At the end of June 2024  net financing from factoring programmes amounted to €191.3 million  marking an increase compared to €179.2 million recorded at the end of 2023 and €182.6 million in the same period in 2023.Capital expenditure is under control and amounts to €32.5 million allocated mainly to capacity projects for growing products and automation to improve industrial efficiency. In the first half of 2023  investments amounted to €40.4 million.Free cash flow for the first half of the year is negative at €-75.9 million  which is in line with the cash consumption profile for this period. Free cash flow in the first half of 2023 was positive given the measures taken to reduce the exceptionally high working capital requirement in December 2022.Net financial debt amounts to €620 million at the end of June 2024  compared to €552 million at the end of December 2023 and €649 million at the end of June 2023. Compared to December 2023  debt is increasing due to seasonality  but the leverage remains stable at 2.0x of the adjusted EBITDA of the last 12 months (1.9x at the end of December 2023). Leverage was reduced by -0.8x compared to June 2023.At the end of June 2024  the Group had a high level of liquidity amounting to €525 million comprising the undrawn RCF in an amount of €299 million  other confirmed and unconfirmed credit lines in an amount of €51 million and €175 million in cash.Scope effectOn 2 July 2024  the Group signed a disposal agreement of its California distribution business (Diamond W – around $60 million in annual revenue). The assets and liabilities of this activity were classified as “assets held for sale” in the accounts published on 30 June 2024.In addition  on 3 July 2024  the Group concluded the acquisition of one of its partners  Classic Turf & Tracks  a sports field construction company specialising in post tension concrete sub-bases. This will enable the Group to consolidate its positions in certain states in Northeastern United States and strengthen its tennis court offering. The company’s revenue is around $25 million.OutlookThe trend observed in the first quarter of 2024 continued in the second quarter with a decline in activity in the flooring sector. High interest rates and persistent inflation continue to weigh on the number of new construction and renovation projects. The Group does not anticipate a short-term improvement in the environment or a rapid recovery of the building market.The European market experienced the most severe slowdown and remains sluggish. The Group has adapted its cost structure  industrial footprint and organisation in order to be more agile and profitable. These measures are combined with ongoing commercial efforts (range renewal  new product launches  innovation) and should support year-over-year performance improvement.In North America  the construction and renovation indicators remain extremely low  primarily affecting the Residential market  to which the Group is exposed to a limited extent (~12% of the segment’s sales). The recovery measures taken by the Group in this area are paying off in the growing Commercial segments. The improvement in results recorded in the first half of the year should be confirmed for the whole year.Sports continues to benefit from a strong artificial turf order book  similar to 2023. Athletics track activities in North America and sports fields in Europe are expected to generate annual revenue growth. Taking advantage of its leading position in North America  Tarkett has a strong presence on higher value-added projects  which should contribute to improving profit margins over the year. In a highly competitive and consolidating environment  the acquisition of Classic Turf and Tracks strengthens this positioning  and the Group is paying close attention to any other external growth opportunities.The Group does not anticipate any rapid improvement in market conditions and therefore continues to adapt its production level and cost structure while investing in the launch of new products  in particular ranges with a higher content of recycled products  the renewal of existing collections  but also in innovative growth  productivity and decarbonisation projects.The operational and financial recovery initiated in 2023 will continue in 2024  where the Group aims to generate positive cash flow and reduce debt at the end of the financial year.1) Selling price adjustments in the CIS countries are historically intended to offset currency fluctuations and are therefore excluded from the “organic growth” indicator (see Appendix 1)This press release may contain forward-looking statements.

While we are encouraged by the improving productivity in our U.S. sales organization  we will continue to evaluate ways to increase our support to care providers. After a second quarter 2024 impacted by an unfavorable basis for comparison  given that last year system sales were concentrated in the second quarter  and the reduction in procedure reimbursement rates that we consider temporary  we expect systems sales to accelerate in the U.S. over the rest of the year. We also saw positive developments in several emerging applications: food intolerance  pulmonary nodules and pancreatic cysts. Reversing the low penetration rate of our massive total addressable market remains a core element of Mauna Kea's value creation strategy. I am grateful for the progress our product development teams are making to integrate best-in-class AI and connectivity technologies into Cellvizio  enhancements we believe will greatly benefit patients and practitioners. Finally  the recent obtaining of the business license in China represents an important milestone to support the ramp-up of our JV with Tasly giving us the means to fully tackle this market. Building on these achievements and expecting a catch up in sales in the second half 2024  we are confident to achieve our 2024 guidance of growth in sales over 20%.""Highlights of First Half 2024Solid and Sustainable PPU (Pay-per-Use) Activity in Gastroenterology in the United StatesPPU volumes are now firmly established on a sustainable basis  exceeding 1 000 procedures per quarter compared to approximately 650 procedures on average before Q2 2023. New accounts are achieving significant procedure volumes of 20 to 40 procedures per month  thanks to optimized center selection and more effective onboarding and training methods.During the first semester of 2024  3 new accounts were activated and 3 long-inactive accounts were reactivated using the same onboarding methods. Given the extensive historical system base  Mauna Kea plans to continue reactivating dormant accounts while enrolling new ones.PPUinvoiced Q22022 Q32022 Q42022 Q12023 Q22023 Q32023 Q42023 Q12024 Q22024 Number ofprocedures 686 613 589 693 1 013 887 1 361 1 017 1 062Activity Launch in Food IntoleranceThe first steps towards significant activity in food intolerance were taken this semester with the establishment of 3 centers of excellence in the United States and Europe aimed at training physicians on this indication. Several workshops have also been conducted throughout the semester to promote the use of Cellvizio in this application. In total  3 systems dedicated to this application were sold  including 1 in the United States to Stanford University  and 2 in Germany  contributing to revenue growth.To optimally structure this activity and provide it with the necessary operational and financial resources  the company recently announced the creation of a dedicated subsidiary  CellTolerance. The goal is to commercialize a unique science-based program for the detection and treatment of food intolerances  which will integrate data into a comprehensive dataset trained by AI to achieve unprecedented clinical insights. This data could ultimately serve pharmaceutical and nutrition companies to design personalized treatments  optimize nutritional plans and predict individual responses to therapies and dietary interventions. It is also envisioned that CellTolerance could quickly open its capital to venture capital funds specializing in these fields to fund the development of its program independently.New Addressable Indications: Pancreatic Cysts and Pulmonary NodulesBeyond food intolerance  the use of Cellvizio has advanced in two other indications:Firstly  the CHRU of Nancy  France  with the renowned team of Professor Renaud  has acquired a Cellvizio  becoming the first thoracic surgery service in Europe to adopt Mauna Kea's technology. This allows access to all areas of the lungs and real-time visualization of tissue architecture  significantly increasing early lung cancer diagnosis from 75% to 90%.Furthermore  very positive data on the use of Cellvizio in pancreatic cysts were presented at the Digestive Disease Week ® (DDW) Conference in Washington  D.C. in May. It was shown that Cellvizio is far superior to conventional methods for classifying  characterizing  and risk-stratifying pancreatic cystic lesions  with a sensitivity and accuracy of 98%. Given the challenges in diagnosing pancreatic cancer and low effectiveness of traditional methods  leading to late diagnoses for false negatives or unnecessary interventions for false positives  this advancement offers great hope for patients. This also paves the way for significant market opportunity for Mauna Kea and for potential commercial partnerships.Successful Class II Medical Device Business License in China ObtainedThanks to the business license issued by the Shanghai Municipal Medical Products Administration  the Tasly JV is now operational and ready to address the Chinese market  with first units of systems and probes sales recorded. With this milestone  Tasly Mauna Kea Medical Engineering Technology can engage in the wholesale distribution of Class II medical devices across China  paving the way to its commercial development and market expansion there.Renewal of the PACEO equity line with Vester FinanceIn order to maintain an equity financing reserve  the Company has renewed its PACEO line with Vester Finance  on identical terms to the previous expired operation2. This renewal was decided by the Company's Board of Directors  in accordance with the 18th resolution of the General Shareholders' Meeting of June 6  20243  and did not give rise to the preparation of a notice (prospectus) subject to AMF approval. Assuming this financing facility were to be drawn down in full  a shareholder holding 1.00% of Mauna Kea Technologies' share capital prior to its implementation would see his or her stake fall to 0.92% of the share capital on a non-diluted basis4 and 0.94% of the share capital on a diluted basis5.Second Quarter & First Half 2024 Sales by Category(in €k) “ IFRS Q2 2024 Q2 2023 Change% H1 2024 H1 2023 Change% Systems 509 699 -27% 579 1 086 -47% Consumables 815 1 100 -26% 1 686 1 761 -4% Services 390 382 +2% 607 700 -13% Total sales excl. license 1 714 2 180 -20% 2 871 3 546 -19% License fees 503 499 +1% 1 004 3 301 -70% Total sales 2 217 2 680 -17% 3 875 6 848 -43% Unaudited figuresIn the second quarter of 2024  total sales amounted to €2.2m  down 17% mainly due to lower system sales  compared to a strong comparative quarter last year. It must be noted that 80% of U.S. system sales in 2023 were recorded in the second quarter  while no system sales were recorded in the second half. In this sense  for the second half of 2024  the H2 2023 will provide a softer basis for comparison.Consumable sales were impacted by a temporary reimbursement reduction from CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services)  notably affecting PPU revenue despite a significant growth in volume.Services grew by 2%  thanks to renewed contracts in the U.S. and additional billing to Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: ) for the CLEAR study.In the first half of 2024  total sales amounted to €3.9m  a decrease of 43% compared to the first half of 2023 sales.

The digitalization  marketing  and cloud businesses supported growth which  as predicted  faced a challenging comparison with 2023 revenues boosted by Ségur public health investments for Healthcare professionals and a headwind from an expected slowing of international business in the second quarter.Analysis of business trends by divisionSoftware & ServicesFirst half Change H1 2024 / 2023 in millions of euros 2024 2023 reclassified(1) Reported vs. reclassified(1) Like for like(2) vs.reclassified(1) Cegedim Santé 38.9 39.8 -2.4% -11.5% Insurance  HR  Pharmacies  and other services 86.7 84.5 2.7% 2.7% International businesses 26.5 26.3 0.6% -1.1% Software & Services 152.1 150.6 1.0% -1.7%Cegedim Santé saw its revenues decline 2.4% in the first half. The drop was expected and due mainly to a demanding comparison with 2023  when the division benefited from the Ségur public health investments. The favorable scope impact is attributable to the consolidation of Visiodent starting on March 1  2024. Cegedim Santé aims to offset the absence of the Ségur public health investments with organic growth in 2024. It is off to a great start and gradually starting to erase the shortfall: organic growth improved from -17.1% in the first quarter to -5.5% in the second quarter.The other French subsidiaries posted growth of 2.7%  driven mainly by dynamic growth in HR activities  which are proving resilient owing to the diversification of their client base. Insurance activities benefited from project-based business in the second quarter. Pharmacy activities  on the other hand  were hit by a demanding comparison in revenue from installing and updating equipment  which got a boost in 2023 in preparation for the inclusion of new Ségur-related functionalities.The international subsidiaries posted slightly negative organic growth  chiefly due to the Group’s decision to refocus its products for doctors in the UK on Scotland and exit England  Northern Ireland  and Wales. Those refocusing efforts got underway in the second quarter. Growth in Spain  on the other hand  has been robust. Sales to hospitals in the Murcia region and to health clinics are one of the big reasons. The positive currency impact was mainly due to the pound sterling.FlowFirst half Change H1 2024 / 2023 in millions of euros 2024 2023 reclassified(1) Reported vs. reclassified(1) Like for like(2) vs.reclassified(1) E-business 30.0 27.8 7.6% 7.4% Third-party payer 19.6 19.0 3.1% 3.1% Flow 49.5 46.8 5.8% 5.7%The E-business activity grew 7.6%. Both of its business lines made positive contributions: Invoicing & purchasing continues to develop and saw a pick-up in business in France and abroad—notably in Germany  where companies are getting ready for the reform set to take effect on January 1  2025. The Healthcare Flow segment is also getting a boost from dynamic new offerings for hospitals that are designed to make their drug purchasing secure.The 3.1% growth in Third-party payer business was driven mainly by development of fraud detection products and services. As a reminder  growth was hampered in the first quarter by the transfer of business related to the Allianz contract to the BPO division in April 2023.Data & MarketingFirst half Change H1 2024 / 2023 in millions of euros 2024 2023 reclassified1 Reported vs. reclassified(1) Like for like(2) vs.reclassified(1) Data 28.1 28.9 -2.8% -2.8% Marketing 31.3 26.1 20.0% 20.0% Data & Marketing 59.3 54.9 8.0% 8.0%Data business was down marginally in the first half  during which sales in France fared better than international sales.Marketing in pharmacies continues to expand at a brisk pace  propelled by the unit’s phygital media offering.BPOFirst half Change H1 2024 / 2023 in millions of euros 2024 2023 reclassified(1) Reported vs. reclassified(1) Like for like(2) vs.reclassified(1) Insurance BPO 28.7 22.2 29.5% 29.5% Business Services BPO* 11.2 10.7 5.1% 5.1% BPO 39.9 32.8 21.6% 21.6%*BPO for HR and digitalization activitiesManaged services for health and personal protection insurance companies continues to enjoy a positive comparison effect related to the Allianz contract  which started in the second quarter of 2023  and a flourishing overflow business.Business services BPO (HR and digitalization services) posted revenue growth of 5.1% in the first half  chiefly due to the good momentum for its compliance offering.Cloud & SupportFirst half Change H1 2024 / 2023 in millions of euros 2024 2023 reclassified(1) Reported vs. reclassified(1) Like for like(2) vs.reclassified(1) Cloud & Support 18.1 15.8 14.5% 14.5%The Cloud & Support division  buoyed by its Cloud products and services  had yet another great performance in the second quarter  with growth of 14.5%.HighlightsApart from the items cited below  to the best of the company’s knowledge  there were no events or changes during H1 2024 that would materially alter the Group’s financial situation.Acquisition of VisiodentOn February 15  2024  Cegedim Santé acquired Visiodent  a leading French publisher of management software for dental practices and health clinics. Visiodent launched the market’s first 100% SaaS solution  Veasy  at a time when it was significantly expanding its organization. Its users now include the country’s largest nation-wide networks of health clinics  both cooperative and privately owned  as well as several thousand dental surgeons in private practice. Visiodent generated revenue of c.€10 million in 2023 and began contributing to Cegedim Group’s consolidation scope on March 1  2024. Post the acquisition  Cegedim is in compliance with all of its covenants and financing contracts.Euris litigationCegedim  jointly with IQVIA (formerly IMS Health)  is being sued by Euris for unfair competition. Cegedim has asked the court to dismiss the case against the Company. On December 17  2018  the Paris Commercial Court granted Cegedim’s request  which IQVIA then appealed. On December 8  2021  the Court of Appeals upheld the judgement in favor of Cegedim. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court  and in a ruling on March 20  2024  the court overturned the Court of Appeals judgement that had exonerated Cegedim. As a result  the case has been sent back to the Paris Court of Appeals  with a different set of judges.War in UkraineThe Group does not do business in Russia or Ukraine and has no assets exposed to those countries.Significant transactions and events post June 30  2024To the best of the company’s knowledge  there were no post-closing events or changes after June 30  2024  that would materially alter the Group’s financial situation. The Group expects to finalize the refinancing of its financial debt prior to the release of first-half results.OutlookBased on currently available information  the Group expects 2024 like-for-like revenue(1) growth to be in the range of 5-8% relative to 2023. Recurring operating income should continue to improve  following a similar trajectory as in 2023.These targets are not forecasts and may need to be revised if there is a significant worsening of geopolitical  macroeconomic  or currency risks.---------(1) To take advantage of synergies  Cegedim Outsourcing  Audiprint  and BSV have been reassigned to the Cloud & Support division.(2) At constant scope and exchange rates.WEBCAST ON JULY 25  2024  AT 6:15 PM (PARIS TIME) The webcast is available at: www.cegedim.fr/webcast The H1 2024 revenues presentation is available here:https://www.cegedim.fr/finance/documentation/Pages/presentations.aspx2024 financial calendar2024 September 26 after the closeOctober 24 after the close First-half 2024 resultsQ3 2024 revenuesFinancial calendar: https://www.cegedim.fr/finance/agenda/Pages/default.aspxNoticeThis press release is available in French and in English.

(the “Company"" or ""Besi"") (Euronext Amsterdam: BESI; OTC markets: BESIY)  a leading manufacturer of assembly equipment for the semiconductor industry  today announced its results for the second quarter and first half year ended June 30  2024.Key Highlights Q2-24Revenue of € 151.2 million up 3.3% vs. Q1-24 due primarily to higher shipments for photonics and 2.5D assembly applications. Down 7.0% vs. Q2-23 principally due to continued weakness in smartphone end markets partially offset by growth in hybrid bonding and other advanced packaging applicationsOrders of € 185.2 million up 45.0% vs. Q1-24 and 64.5% versus Q2-23 principally due to significant growth in hybrid bonding  photonics and 2.5D assembly solutions for AI applications partially offset by ongoing weakness in automotive end marketsGross margin of 65.0% decreased by 2.2 points vs. Q1-24 and by 0.6 points vs. Q2-23 due primarily to product mixNet income of € 41.9 million increased 23.2% vs. Q1-24 primarily due to a € 10.0 million decrease in share-based compensation. Vs. Q2-23  net income decreased 20.3% due principally to lower revenue and increased R&D spending in support of wafer level assembly activities. Q2-24 net margin rose to 27.7% vs. 23.2% in Q1-24 but declined versus the 32.4% reported in Q2-23Net cash of € 74.4 million at quarter end was flat compared to Q2-23 and reflected the payment of € 171.5 million in dividends and the conversion into equity of € 89.9 million of Convertible Notes in Q2-24Key Highlights H1-24Revenue of € 297.5 million increased 0.5% vs. H1-23 principally due to higher demand for hybrid bonding and other AI-related advanced packaging systems offset by lower revenue for high-end mobile applicationsOrders of € 313.0 million up 22.9% vs. H1-23 due to increased demand for hybrid bonding  photonics and 2.5D assembly solutions partially offset by lower bookings for automotive and mobile applicationsGross margin of 66.1% increased by 1.1 point versus H1-23Net income of € 75.9 million decreased € 11.2 million  or 12.9%  vs. H1-23 primarily due to € 9.1 million higher share-based compensation and € 7.1 million higher R&D spending.

Blickman  President and Chief Executive Officer of Besi  commented:“Besi reported second quarter revenue  gross margin and operating profit at the high end of guidance with significant order growth realized for hybrid bonding and other AI related applications. For the quarter  revenue of € 151.2 million and net income of € 41.9 million increased by 3.3% and 23.2%  respectively  versus Q1-24. Versus Q2-23  revenue and net income declined by 7.0% and 20.3%  respectively. Sequential and year over year comparisons highlighted contrasting growth trends for AI and mainstream assembly equipment markets in recent quarters. Since H2-23  we have seen significant order growth from high performance computing applications including 2.5D  3D and photonics assembly solutions in support of a broad based expansion of generative AI demand. Such growth has been partially offset by a slower recovery  as expected  in mainstream assembly markets and in China  particularly for high end smartphones  automotive and industrial applications. In general  post pandemic inventory levels at semiconductor producers still remain elevated despite gradually increasing utilization rates.Order trends this first half year highlighted increased demand for Besi’s systems used in AI and other advanced packaging applications. Bookings of € 185.2 million in Q2-24 and € 313.0 million in H1-24 represented increases of 64.5% and 22.9%  respectively  versus prior year periods. Moreover  we estimate that approximately 50% of our orders over the past 12 months were AI related. In addition  we received orders for 29 hybrid bonding systems in Q2-24 from two customers for estimated delivery in Q4-24 and Q1-25 further highlighting the increased market adoption of this new process technology. Substantially all of such orders were for our latest generation 100 nm accuracy system to be used in 3D logic applications. We anticipate additional orders in H2-24 as customers ramp capacity for high volume manufacturing in 2025. In addition  we received an important second order this quarter for our TCB Next system.Besi continues to navigate an extended assembly downturn at high levels of profitability as a result of increased 2.5D and 3D order momentum with gross and net margins realized of 65.0% and 27.7%  respectively  in Q2-24. For H1-24  gross margins improved to 66.1% versus 65.0% in H1-23. The reduction in our net margin to 25.5% this first half year primarily reflected a 24% increase in development spending and increased share based compensation versus H1-23. The R&D increase was associated with next generation hybrid bonding development targeting sub-100 nm placement accuracy  the ongoing build out of Besi’s hybrid bonding and TCB capabilities in anticipation of expanded logic and memory adoption and enhancements to our current product portfolio for the next market upcycle.Our financial position is healthy with net cash of € 74.4 million at quarter end (equal to 13% of our last twelve months revenue) post the capital allocation of € 186.3 million in the form of dividends and share repurchases during the quarter and the conversion of € 89.9 million of Convertible Notes into ordinary shares. On July 17  2024  we successfully completed an offering of € 350 million of 4.5% Senior Notes due 2031 to further solidify our capital base and help fund growth over the next decade at attractive terms.We are encouraged about Besi’s prospects given expanded hybrid bonding adoption for both logic and HBM applications  traction gained in the marketplace by our next generation TCB system and continued demand growth for our flip chip and multi module die attach systems for 2.5D applications. In addition  we anticipate additional share gains in the next market upturn as node sizes shrink further and placement accuracy increases. All such trends play to the strengths of Besi’s core competencies. For Q3-24  we forecast that revenue will be flat plus or minus 5% versus Q2-24 with gross margins ranging between 64%-66% based on our projected product mix. Aggregate operating expenses are forecast to decrease by 0-5% versus Q2-24.”Share Repurchase ActivityDuring the quarter  Besi repurchased approximately 105 000 of its ordinary shares at an average price of € 140.84 per share or a total of € 14.8 million. Cumulatively  as of June 30  2024  a total of € 39.2 million has been purchased under the current € 60 million share repurchase program at an average price of € 138.09 per share. As of June 30  2024  Besi held approximately 1.4 million shares in treasury equal to 1.8% of its shares outstanding.Convertible NotesAt June 30  2024  Besi’s Convertible Notes outstanding equaled € 200.1 million. During the quarter  € 89.9 million of Convertible Notes due 2027 were converted into approximately 1.8 million shares.Senior Note OfferingOn July 17  2024  Besi completed the issuance of € 350 million of 4.5% Senior Notes due July 15  2031 via a private placement to institutional investors. The Notes may not be called by the Issuer until January 15  2031 and are listed on the International Stock Exchange.

The media conglomerate also posted a 98.4% spike in second-quarter revenues.Lagardère  the media  publishing and travel retail conglomerate which was acquired last year  as well as Canal+ Group  bolstered revenues.

At constant currency and perimeter  EBITA increased by 13.5%  while adjusted net income reached $357 million.Canal+ Group’s revenues went up by 4.6% to $3.2 billion  helped by TV operations in mainland France and overseas. Revenues from Canal+’s film and TV group Studiocanal also increased by 8.6%  thanks in part to the performance of Amy Winehouse biopic “Back to Black” which was released on April 24 and has sold around the world.Under the leadership of CEO and chairman Maxime Saada  Canal+ has also increased its interest in Scandinavian pay TV banner Viaplay to 29.33%  becoming its largest shareholder; and recently took a stake in leading Senegalese production company Marodi TV.

Canal+ Group is also continuing to strike deals and partnerships with big U.S. players  including Warner Bros. Discovery which signed a distribution agreement with the French banner for its standalone streaming service Max.Vivendi’s management board gave an update on the group’s plan to split into three separate entities and list assets.

Such forward-looking statements are based on Dassault Systèmes management's current views and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties. Actual results or performances may differ materially from those in such statements due to a range of factors.The Group’s actual results or performance may be materially negatively affected by numerous risks and uncertainties  as described in the “Risk Factors” section 1.9 of the 2023 Universal Registration Document (‘Document d'enregistrement universel’) filed with the AMF (French Financial Markets Authority) on March 18  2024  available on the Group’s website www.3ds.com.In particular  please refer to the risk factor “Uncertain Global Economic Environment” in section 1.9.1.1 of the 2023 Universal Registration Document set out below for ease of reference:“In light of the uncertainties regarding economic  business  social  health and geopolitical conditions at the global level  Dassault Systèmes’ revenue  net earnings and cash flows may grow more slowly  whether on an annual or quarterly basis  mainly due to the following factors:the deployment of Dassault Systèmes’ solutions may represent a large portion of a customer’s investments in software technology. Decisions to make such an investment are impacted by the economic environment in which the customers operate. Uncertain global geopolitical  economic and health conditions and the lack of visibility or the lack of financial resources may cause some customers  e.g. within the automotive  aerospace  energy or natural resources industries  to reduce  postpone or terminate their investments  or to reduce or not renew ongoing paid maintenance for their installed base  which impact larger customers’ revenue with their respective sub-contractors;the political  economic and monetary situation in certain geographic regions where Dassault Systèmes operates could become more volatile and impact Dassault Systèmes’ business  for example  due to stricter export compliance rules or the introduction of new customs tariffs;continued pressure or volatility on raw materials and energy prices could also slow down Dassault Systèmes’ diversification efforts in new industries;uncertainties regarding the extent and duration of inflation could adversely affect the financial position of Dassault Systèmes; andthe sales cycle of the Dassault Systèmes’ products – already relatively long due to the strategic nature of such investments for customers – could further lengthen.The occurrence of crises – health and political crises in particular – could have consequences both for the health and safety of Dassault Systèmes’ employees and for the Company. It could also adversely impact the financial situation or financing and supply capabilities of Dassault Systèmes’ existing and potential customers  commercial and technology partners  some of whom may be forced to temporarily close sites or cease operations. A deteriorating economic environment could generate increased price pressure and affect the collection of receivables  which would negatively impact Dassault Systèmes’ revenue  financial performance and market position.Dassault Systèmes makes every effort to take into consideration this uncertain macroeconomic outlook. Dassault Systèmes’ business results  however  may not develop as anticipated. Furthermore  due to factors affecting sales of Dassault Systèmes’ products and services  there may be a substantial time lag between an improvement in global economic and business conditions and an upswing in the Company’s business results.In preparing such forward-looking statements  the Group has in particular assumed an average US dollar to euro exchange rate of US$1.10 per €1.00 as well as an average Japanese yen to euro exchange rate of JPY155.0 to €1.00  before hedging for the third quarter 2024. The Group has in particular assumed an average US dollar to euro exchange rate of US$1.09 per €1.00 as well as an average Japanese yen to euro exchange rate of JPY159.7 to €1.00  before hedging for the full year 2024. However  currency values fluctuate  and the Group’s results may be significantly affected by changes in exchange rates.Non-IFRS Financial InformationReaders are cautioned that the supplemental non-IFRS financial information presented in this press release is subject to inherent limitations. It is not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles and should not be considered in isolation from or as a substitute for IFRS measurements. The supplemental non-IFRS financial information should be read only in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS.

The Group believes it is helpful to evaluate its growth exclusive of currency impacts  particularly to help understand revenue trends in its business. Therefore  the Group provides percentage increases or decreases in its revenue and expenses (in both IFRS as well as non-IFRS) to eliminate the effect of changes in currency values  particularly the U.S. dollar and the Japanese yen  relative to the euro. When trend information is expressed ""in constant currencies""  the results of the ""prior"" period have first been recalculated using the average exchange rates of the comparable period in the current year  and then compared with the results of the comparable period in the current year.While constant currency calculations are not considered to be an IFRS measure  the Group believes these measures are critical to understanding its global revenue results and to compare with many of its competitors who report their financial results in U.S. dollars. Therefore  Dassault Systèmes includes this calculation for comparing IFRS revenue figures as well non-IFRS revenue figures for comparable periods. All information at constant exchange rates is expressed as a rounded percentage and therefore may not precisely reflect the absolute figures.Information on Growth excluding acquisitions (“organic growth”)In addition to financial indicators on the entire Group’s scope  Dassault Systèmes provides growth excluding acquisitions effect  also named organic growth. In order to do so  the data relating to the scope is restated excluding acquisitions  from the date of the transaction  over a period of 12 months.Information on Industrial SectorsThe Group provides broad end-to-end software solutions and services: its platform-based virtual twin experiences combine modeling  simulation  data science and collaborative innovation to support companies in the three sectors it serves  namely Manufacturing Industries  Life Sciences & Healthcare  and Infrastructure & Cities.These three sectors comprise twelve industries:Manufacturing Industries: Transportation & Mobility; Aerospace & Defense; Marine & Offshore; Industrial Equipment; High-Tech; Home & Lifestyle; Consumer Packaged Goods - Retail.

These divisions benefited from sustained trends in decarbonization and the energy transition  particularly for Marine & Offshore and Industry. Additionally  the Certification segment experienced strong demand for sustainability and ESG-driven services.An eighth of the portfolio (Consumer Products Services) delivered high single-digit organic revenue growth (up 7.3%). The growth was led by the consumer segment in most geographies and by its strategy of geography  sector  and services diversification.Half of the portfolio  including Buildings & Infrastructure and Agri-Food & Commodities  achieved mid-single-digit organic revenue growth (up 4.3% and 4.6% respectively).Solid financial positionAt the end of June 2024  the Group's adjusted net financial debt increased compared to the level as of December 31  2023  as a result of the use of cash and cash equivalents linked to the EUR 200 million share buyback program executed in Q2. The Group has a solid financial structure with most of its maturities beyond 2026.Bureau Veritas had EUR 1.5 billion in available cash and cash equivalents  and EUR 600 million in undrawn committed credit lines as of June 30  2024. The adjusted net financial debt/EBITDA ratio was maintained at a low level of 1.06x (from 0.95x last year).The average maturity of the Group’s financial debt was 4.9 years  with a blended average cost of funds over the half year of 2.9% (excluding the impact of IFRS 16)  compared to 2.7% at December 31  2023.Bureau Veritas shareholders approved the distribution of a dividend for the 2023 financial yearAt the Bureau Veritas Annual Shareholders’ Meeting  shareholders approved the distribution of a dividend of EUR 0.83 per share for the 2023 financial year (3rd resolution  approved at 99.99%)  paid in cash on July 4  2024.2024 share buyback programThe Group executed the EUR 200 million share buyback program announced on March 20  2024  as follows:an acquisition of c. 0.8% of the Group’s shares or the equivalent of EUR 100 million on April 5  2024  completed under the Wendel placement.an additional acquisition of the remaining EUR 100 million  completed by the Group through the market in May and June 2024  of an additional c. 0.8% of its shares.As of June 30  2024  the entire program had therefore been completed.In accordance with the purpose of the share buyback program approved by the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting  the shares bought back will be used for cancellation purposes and for any other purposes authorized by the Company’s shareholders at the Annual Shareholders’ Meeting of June 22  2023.First A3 long-term credit rating by Moody’s and inaugural A3 rated bond issuance of EUR 500 million with a May 2036 maturityOn April 24  2024  Bureau Veritas announced that it had been assigned its first long-term credit rating of A3 by Moody’s  with a “stable” outlook. This long-term credit rating will help Bureau Veritas in further diversifying its sources of funding  gaining enhanced access to capital markets  and managing debt maturities in line with the Group’s strategy. The full rating report is available on moodys.com.Subsequently  on May 16  2024  the Group announced the successful completion of a EUR 500 million A3 rated new bond issuance maturing in May 2036 and carrying a coupon of 3.5%. The final orderbook amounted to more than EUR 1.5 billion  which represents three times the targeted amount. Such a high level of oversubscription enabled Bureau Veritas to price with a final spread much below initial price indications. This underlines the strong confidence of investors in Bureau Veritas’ business model as well as the quality of its credit profile.This issuance allows Bureau Veritas to seize attractive market conditions for general corporate purposes  including the refinancing of its bond maturing in January 2025  thereby lengthening the average maturity of its debt.FOCUSED PORTFOLIOIn line with the LEAP | 28 strategy of active portfolio management and to focus the portfolio on market leadership positions  Bureau Veritas has activated an M&A program to develop new market strongholds:in Cybersecurity : in July 2024  the Group signed an agreement to acquire Security Innovation  a US-based player specialized in software security services focused on software testing  SDLC advisory (Secure Software Development Lifecycle) and training.

Consumer Products Services further recovered  up 7.3% organically in the first half (including 8.3% in the second quarter) while both Agri Food & Commodities and Buildings & Infrastructure grew mid-single digits organically  both showing sequential improvement in the second quarter.By geography  growth in the Americas was strong (27% of revenue; up 10.3% organically)  led by a double-digit increase in Latin America and high single-digit growth in Canada.

This represents an adjusted operating margin of 15.0% stable compared to the first half of 2023.

Organically  it rose by 88 basis points  benefiting from pricing  operating leverage and a positive mix.Sustainability achievementsDuring the second quarter of 2024  Bureau Veritas issued an Approval in Principle (AiP) to China Ship Design & Research Centre (CSDC) for its latest ammonia-fueled medium-range chemical tanker design  leading the sector towards a greener and more sustainable future.AGRI-FOOD & COMMODITIESIN EUR MILLIONS H1 2024 H1 2023 CHANGE ORGANIC SCOPE CURRENCY Revenue 613.9 611.5 +0.4% +4.6% - (4.2)% Adjusted Operating Profit 75.6 82.3 (8.2)% Adjusted Operating Margin 12.3% 13.5% (115)bps (90)bps - (25)bpsThe Agri-Food & Commodities business delivered 6.0% organic revenue growth in the second quarter of 2024  thus achieving 4.6% revenue growth on an organic basis in the first half of the year.The Oil & Petrochemicals segment (O&P  32% of divisional revenue) recorded a high-single-digit increase in organic revenue in the first half of the year  with the second quarter growth primarily stemming from focused business development with key accounts in North America and the Middle East. Strong momentum was also maintained in Europe  where the Group saw market share gains. Asian activities are gradually recovering  with favorable perspectives in the non-trade activities such as Oil Condition Monitoring-related services.After a stable performance in the first quarter  the Metals & Minerals segment (M&M  31% of divisional revenue) showed signs of recovery in the second quarter with low–single-digit organic revenue growth. The Upstream business (which represents more than two-thirds of the divisional revenue) has been facing a slow start to the year on the back of a challenging macro environment. Early signs of recovery have been observed with high gold prices stimulating a pickup in exploration drillings. The Group continued to execute its on-site laboratory development strategy  with double-digit growth achieved in the first half and new contracts secured in Chile and West Africa. Trade activities delivered mid-to-high single-digit growth in the first half  with good traction in the second quarter especially in China and India.In the first half of 2024  Agri-Food (23% of divisional revenue) posted high–single-digit growth on an organic basis. The Agri sub-segment was boosted by growth in both Upstream and Trade activities. The growth was particularly strong in the Middle East in the second quarter  owing to sustained business development and key contract wins in many countries. Additionally  the Americas benefited from excellent crop yields despite floods in Brazil. The Food business grew mid-single digits organically  owing to the continued recovery of the Australian activities from the diversification strategy and price increases.Government services (14% of the divisional revenue) delivered a stable year –on year organic growth in the first half of the year  due mainly to unfavorable comparables and expected contract cycles. These were partly offset by the good performance of Verification of Conformity contracts in some Middle East countries in the second quarter of 2024  with a promising pipeline of new opportunities for Q3 onwards.The adjusted operating margin for the Agri-Food & Commodities business declined to 12.3%  down 115 basis points compared to last year. This was attributed to a negative business mix effect (due to the soft performance of Metals & Minerals) and negative forex impact.Sustainability achievementsIn the first half of 2024  Bureau Veritas delivered several sustainability services to its customers  ranging from services around fugitive emissions commodities  and Green Objects such as sustainable aviation fuel or traceability for wood products.INDUSTRYIN EUR MILLIONS H1 2024 H1 2023 CHANGE ORGANIC SCOPE CURRENCY Revenue 624.0 617.4 +1.1% +17.5% (2.4)% (14.0)% Adjusted Operating Profit 79.3 76.1 +4.2% Adjusted Operating Margin 12.7% 12.3% +38bps +92bps +14bps (68)bpsIndustry achieved a strong organic revenue increase of 17.5% in the first half of 2024  including 18.2% growth in the second quarter led by most businesses and geographies.Customer spending remains strong in all energy sectors  driven by energy security and transition needs. Across all industrial sectors  the Group sees good growth momentum.By market  the stability in Power & Utilities (13% of divisional revenue) continued to reflect the business transformation undertaken in Latin America  where the decision was made last year to exit low-profitability contracts. In Europe  the stable growth in the nuclear power generation reflects the ramp-up of QA/QC inspection projects in the UK and France offsetting the completion of the French EPR (European pressurized reactor) Flamanville 3 project.Within Power & Utilities  Renewable Power Generation activities (solar  wind  hydrogen) continued their growth momentum with double-digit organic performance in most geographies. The US led the growth with the execution of a large number of solar projects. China Renewables spending remains strong driving a sustained growth dynamic.In Oil & Gas (32% of divisional revenue)  activity remained strong  with double digits organically in the first half. Both Capex and Opex services increased substantially across most geographies as they continued to capitalize on a favorable investment cycle  the Group’s recognized expertise and its global capabilities. The growth was broad across the United States  Latin America  the Middle East  and Asia.Industry Products Certification (18% of divisional revenue) grew double-digits organically. This growth was driven by price increases and increased activity in Pressure & Welding and Electromechanical & Advanced Technologies sub-segments. Growth was particularly strong in the Asia Pacific and Middle East regions.Elsewhere  the Environmental Testing business (10% of divisional revenue) grew high-single digits organically. In Canada  the remediation works benefited from favorable weather conditions during the first quarter  further bolstering the segment's performance.Industry’s adjusted operating margin for the half year increased by 38 basis points to 12.7%.

The US platform delivered mid-single-digit organic revenue growth and continued to capitalize on its diversified portfolio of activities. The data center commissioning business maintained strong double-digit organic growth thanks to an uplift in demand for its services from both new and existing clients in most regions globally  combined with pricing initiatives. This is due to the ongoing growth in data generation  cloud computing and AI. Double-digit growth was also achieved in both Opex-related services and the Capex-infrastructure business. Code compliance maintained robust activity thanks to housing expansion in central and east regions. In Latin America  the strong growth in both Brazil and Chile was mitigated by contracts termination in Argentina.Business in Europe (50% of divisional revenue) was robust overall. Most countries contributed to the growth  with a leading Italy's performance from continued infrastructure spending of the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (NRRP). France continues to grow with Capex-related activities outperforming thanks to the group’s wins in infrastructure and public works (including the 2024 Paris Olympic Games)  which largely offset the declining residential market segment. Opex services  representing three quarters of the country’s revenue  was resilient and grew from positive pricing and an uptake of new services.The Asia Pacific region (19% of divisional revenue) achieved a high single-digit organic revenue increase led by high growth in South and Southeastern Asian countries and Australia. China had a stable performance driven by energy-related construction activity. Weak public spending remains a constraint for growth in transport infrastructure.Lastly  in the Middle East & Africa region (4% of divisional revenue)  the Group maintained its strong momentum  delivering double-digit organic revenue growth primarily driven by the performance in Saudi Arabia  where it benefited from the development of numerous megaprojects.Adjusted operating margin for the half year slightly eroded by 60 basis points to 11.6% from 12.2% in the prior year. This reflects the impact of low activity in China which was not fully offset by the US improvement.Sustainability achievementsIn the second quarter of 2024  in France  the Group signed an exclusive contract with the French National Housing Agency / ANAH (Agence Nationale de l'Habitat) to deliver energy performance and efficiency checks on projects financed under the French Energy management subsidies scheme  ""Ma Prime Rénov’”.

This was led by increasing volumes and robust price escalations.QHSE & Specialized Schemes solutions (50% of the divisional revenue) posted double-digit growth in the first half of the year  with strong traction from the recertification year occurring for several schemes across different industries. The certification market benefits from a dynamic of innovation in response to consumers’ needs for customized and voluntary schemes. As an example  Bureau Veritas recently delivered the “Origine France Garantie” label for two car models produced by the French car manufacturer Renault  making them the first full electric vehicles to obtain this certification.Sustainability-related solutions & Digital (Cyber) certification activities (31% of divisional revenue) also recorded very strong double-digit organic growth  with excellent ongoing momentum around carbon services. With double-digit growth in the second quarter of the year  the suite of services and solutions delivered by Bureau Veritas on forestry-related topics is developing strongly.

The Americas also continued to benefit from the geographical  sector and services diversification strategy.The Softlines  Hardlines & Toys segment (accounting for 48% of divisional revenue) delivered double-digit organic growth in the first half of 2024. This growth was driven by a recovery in volumes  which was attributed to the end of destocking and early shipments in response to logistics delays from the Red Sea shipping disruption. The growth was led by China and South East Asian countries exporting to the American market. The Hardlines business was particularly strong  benefiting from a global recovery and an increase in Stock Keeping Units (SKUs).Healthcare (including Beauty and Household) (8% of divisional revenue) posted solid double-digit organic growth during the first half of the year led by the US operations. This was driven by the performance of global accounts  particularly the recently acquired Advanced Testing Laboratory (ATL) which benefited from pricing initiatives and an expanded scope of services.Supply Chain & Sustainability services (14% of divisional revenue) delivered a very good double-digit performance with CSR audits and transition services leading  thanks to a global strong momentum around social audits and green claim verification services.Technology (30% of divisional revenue) saw a mid-single-digit contraction in the first half of 2024  still affected by a global decrease in demand for electronics  wireless products and new mobility equipment (electrical vehicles  notably in China). The second quarter showed an increase in the development and manufacturing of servers’ technologies to respond to AI market needs. Additionally  electrical appliances performed well and benefited from improved consumer spending.In line with LEAP I 28 strategy  the Group continued to invest in the new stronghold of Consumer Technology  with the closing of three acquisitions - OneTech Corp.  Kostec Co. in Korea and Hi Physix Laboratory in India - to bolster its presence in Electrical and Electronics consumer products testing in the key markets of South Korea and India.Adjusted operating margin for the half year increased by 92 basis points to 21.3% from 20.4% in the prior year.

These indicators were defined for the purposes of preparing the Group’s budgets and internal and external reporting. Bureau Veritas considers that these indicators provide additional useful information to financial statement users  enabling them to better understand the Group’s performance  especially its operating performance. Some of these indicators represent benchmarks in the testing  inspection and certification (“TIC”) business and are commonly used and tracked by the financial community. These alternative performance indicators should be seen as complementary to IFRS-compliant indicators and the resulting changes.GROWTHTotal revenue growthThe total revenue growth percentage measures changes in consolidated revenue between the previous year and the current year. Total revenue growth has three components:organic growth;impact of changes in the scope of consolidation (scope effect);impact of changes in exchange rates (currency effect).Organic growthThe Group internally monitors and publishes “organic” revenue growth  which it considers to be more representative of the Group’s operating performance in each of its business sectors.The main measure used to manage and track consolidated revenue growth is like-for-like  also known as organic growth. Determining organic growth enables the Group to monitor trends in its business excluding the impact of currency fluctuations  which are outside of Bureau Veritas’ control  as well as scope effects  which concern new businesses or businesses that no longer form part of the business portfolio. Organic growth is used to monitor the Group’s performance internally.Bureau Veritas considers that organic growth provides management and investors with a more comprehensive understanding of its underlying operating performance and current business trends  excluding the impact of acquisitions  divestments (outright divestments as well as the unplanned suspension of operations – in the event of international sanctions  for example) and changes in exchange rates for businesses exposed to foreign exchange volatility  which can mask underlying trends.The Group also considers that separately presenting organic revenue generated by its businesses provides management and investors with useful information on trends in its industrial businesses  and enables a more direct comparison with other companies in its industry.Organic revenue growth represents the percentage of revenue growth  presented at Group level and for each business  based on a constant scope of consolidation and exchange rates over comparable periods:constant scope of consolidation: data are restated for the impact of changes in the scope of consolidation over a 12-month period;constant exchange rates: data for the current year are restated using exchange rates for the previous year.Scope effectTo establish a meaningful comparison between reporting periods  the impact of changes in the scope of consolidation is determined:for acquisitions carried out in the current year: by deducting from revenue for the current year revenue generated by the acquired businesses in the current year;for acquisitions carried out in the previous year: by deducting from revenue for the current year revenue generated by the acquired businesses in the months in the previous year in which they were not consolidated;for disposals and divestments carried out in the current year: by deducting from revenue for the previous year revenue generated by the disposed and divested businesses in the previous year in the months of the current year in which they were not part of the Group;for disposals and divestments carried out in the previous year: by deducting from revenue for the previous year revenue generated by the disposed and divested businesses in the previous year prior to their disposal/divestment.Currency effectThe currency effect is calculated by translating revenue for the current year at the exchange rates for the previous year.ADJUSTED OPERATING PROFIT AND ADJUSTED OPERATING MARGINAdjusted operating profit and adjusted operating margin are key indicators used to measure the performance of the business  excluding material items that cannot be considered inherent to the Group’s underlying intrinsic performance owing to their nature. Bureau Veritas considers that these indicators  presented at Group level and for each business  are more representative of the operating performance in its industry.Adjusted operating profitAdjusted operating profit represents operating profit prior to adjustments for the following:amortization of intangible assets resulting from acquisitions;impairment of goodwill;impairment and retirement of non-current assets;gains and losses on disposals of subsidiaries and businesses (including fair value adjustment when applicable) and other income and expenses relating to acquisitions (fees and costs on acquisitions of businesses  contingent consideration on acquisitions of businesses);restructuring costs.When an acquisition is carried out during the financial year  the amortization of the related intangible assets is calculated on a time proportion basis.Since a measurement period of 12 months is allowed for determining the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities  amortization of intangible assets in the year of acquisition may  in some cases  be based on a temporary measurement and be subject to minor adjustments in the subsequent reporting period  once the definitive value of the intangible assets is known.Organic adjusted operating profit represents operating profit adjusted for scope and currency effects over comparable periods:at constant scope of consolidation: data are restated based on a 12-month period;at constant exchange rates: data for the current year are restated using exchange rates for the previous year.The scope and currency effects are calculated using a similar approach to that used for revenue for each component of operating profit and adjusted operating profit.Adjusted operating marginAdjusted operating margin expressed as a percentage represents adjusted operating profit divided by revenue. Adjusted operating margin can be presented on an organic basis or at constant exchange rates  thereby  in the latter case  providing a view of the Group’s performance excluding the impact of currency fluctuations  which are outside of Bureau Veritas’ control.Service costs rebilled to clients  that were previously included under the ""Purchases and external charges"" line item  are now presented separately  with no impact on operating profit and net profit in the first half of 2024 and 2023.ADJUSTED EFFECTIVE TAX RATEThe effective tax rate (ETR) represents income tax expense divided by the amount of pre-tax profit.The adjusted effective tax rate (adjusted ETR) represents income tax expense adjusted for the tax effect on adjustment items divided by pre-tax profit before taking into account the adjustment items (see adjusted operating profit definition).ADJUSTED NET PROFITAdjusted attributable net profitAdjusted attributable net profit is defined as attributable net profit adjusted for adjustment items (see adjusted operating profit definition) and for the tax effect on adjustment items. Adjusted attributable net profit excludes non-controlling interests in adjustment items and only concerns continuing operations.Adjusted attributable net profit can be presented at constant exchange rates  thereby providing a view of the Group’s performance excluding the impact of currency fluctuations  which are outside of Bureau Veritas’ control. The currency effect is calculated by translating the various income statement items for the current year at the exchange rates for the previous year.Adjusted attributable net profit per shareAdjusted attributable net profit per share (adjusted EPS or earnings per share) is defined as adjusted attributable net profit divided by the weighted average number of shares outstanding in the period (excluding own shares held by the Group).FREE CASH FLOWFree cash flow represents net cash generated from operating activities (operating cash flow)  adjusted for the following items:purchases of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets;proceeds from disposals of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets;interest paid.Net cash generated from operating activities is shown after income tax paid.Organic free cash flow represents free cash flow at constant scope and exchange rates over comparable periods:at constant scope of consolidation: data are restated based on a 12-month period;at constant exchange rates: data for the current year are restated using exchange rates for the previous year.The scope and currency effects are calculated using a similar approach to that used for revenue for each component of net cash generated from operating activities and free cash flow.FINANCIAL DEBTGross debtGross debt (or gross finance costs/financial debt) represents bank loans and borrowings plus bank overdrafts.Net debtNet debt (or net finance costs/financial debt) as defined and used by the Group represents gross debt less cash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents comprise marketable securities and similar receivables as well as cash at bank and on hand.Adjusted net debtAdjusted net debt (or adjusted net finance costs/financial debt) as defined and used by the Group represents net debt taking into account currency and interest rate hedging instruments.CONSOLIDATED EBITDAConsolidated EBITDA represents net profit before interest  tax  depreciation  amortization and provisions  adjusted for any entities acquired over the last 12 months. Consolidated EBITDA is used by the Group to track its bank covenants.1 At constant currency.2 Alternative performance indicators are presented  defined and reconciled with IFRS in appendix 2 of this press release.3 (Net cash generated from operating activities – lease payments + corporate tax)/adjusted operating profit.4 Greenhouse gas emissions from offices and laboratories  tons of CO 2 equivalent for net emissions corresponding to Scopes 1 and 2 over a period of 12 consecutive months (Q2 2023 to Q1 2024).5 TAR: Total Accident Rate (number of accidents with and without lost time x 200 000/number of hours worked).6 Proportion of women from the Executive Committee to Band II (internal grade corresponding to a management or executive management position) in the Group (number of women on a full-time equivalent basis in a leadership position/total number of full-time equivalents in leadership positions).7 Indicator calculated over a 6-month period for H1 2024  compared to a 12-month period for 2028 target values.8 (Net cash generated from operating activities – lease payments + corporate tax)/adjusted operating profit9 At constant currency.10 (Net cash generated from operating activities – lease payments + corporate tax)/adjusted operating profit.Attachment",neutral,0.15,0.85,0.0,positive,0.74,0.26,0.0,True,English,"['BUREAU VERITAS', 'Early impact', 'new LEAP', 'first half', '2024 revenue outlook', '28 strategy', 'margins', 'first long-term A3 credit rating', 'EUR 200 million share buyback program', 'robust double-digit organic revenue growth', 'High single-digit organic revenue growth', 'accelerated M&A program', 'total cumulated annualized revenue', 'Consumer Products Services Technology', 'main consolidated financial items', 'H2 organic revenue growth', 'Strong organic revenue growth', 'Wendel Group market placement', 'solid organic margin improvement', 'strong underlying market growth', 'strong first half performance', 'press release H1 2024 HIGHLIGHTS', 'EUR 500 million bond', 'high customer demand', 'robust underlying trends', 'Strong cash flow', 'Evolved People model', 'Capital Markets Day', 'Inaugural rated issuance', 'growing sales pipeline', 'Chief Executive Officer', 'Free cash flow', 'net debt/EBITDA ratio', 'constant exchange rates', 'net financial debt', 'Alternative performance indicators', 'new economy services', 'CONSTANT CURRENCY Revenue', 'Attributable net profit', 'focused operational execution', 'H1 2024 Key figures2', 'organic growth', 'LEAP I 28 strategy', 'Strong growth', 'robust backlog', 'Group revenue', 'sustainability services', 'financial statements', 'Growth momentum', '2024 revenue outlook', 'cash conversion3', 'operating margin', 'sustained trends', 'operating profit', 'new strongholds', 'The Group', 'EPS growth', 'Focused Portfolio', 'new strategy', 'Early impact', 'new LEAP', 'second quarter', 'low level', 'Ongoing execution', 'three pillars', 'Performance-led Execution', 'most regions', 'Middle East', 'four bolt', 'three acquisitions', 'two steps', 'Bureau Veritas', 'Hinda Gharbi', '29 basis points', 'excellent results', 'four acquisitions', 'Operating cash-flow', 'energy transition', 'stable” outlook', 'step change', 'H1 results', 'entire portfolio', 'one acquisition', '28 portfolio strategy', 'full year', '2024 Outlook', '2023 CHANGE', 'H1.', 'France', 'July', 'margins1', 'Adjusted', 'June', 'March', 'Americas', 'Africa', 'Asia-Pacific', 'companies', 'Cybersecurity', 'Completion', 'shares', 'phase', 'assignment', 'Moody', 'healthy', 'commitment', 'returns', 'colleagues', 'world', 'beginning', 'addition', 'Board', 'Directors', 'MILLIONS', 'IFRS', 'appendices', 'businesses', 'geographies', 'third', 'Marine', 'Offshore', 'Industry', 'Certification', 'divisions', 'decarbonization', '15.0']",2024-07-25,2024-07-26,globenewswire.com

However  you will have the opportunity to ask questions at the end of the call. [Operator Instructions]I will now hand you over to Stéphane Boujnah  CEO and Chairman of the Managing Board of Euronext  joined by Giorgio Modica  CFO. Thank you.Stéphane BoujnahGood morning  everybody  and thank you for joining us this morning for the Euronext second quarter 2024 results conference call and webcast. I am Stéphane Boujnah  CEO and Chairman of the Managing Board of Euronext  and I will start with the highlights of the second quarter. Giorgio Modica  the Euronext's CFO  will then develop the main business and financial highlights of the second quarter of 2024.As an introduction  I would like to highlight three main points. First  the Euronext diversified business model continues to drive strong top line growth. We have delivered plus 12.2% revenue growth in Q2 2024 compared to Q2 2023  and that brings revenue and income to a new record level of €412.9 million. This very good performance was driven by solid growth in non-volume related businesses  combined with strong growth in clearing  especially in fixed income.Second  thanks to continued cost control in an inflationary environment  we increased our adjusted EBITDA by close to plus 12% year-on-year to €256.8 million  and we grew our adjusted EBITDA margin by plus 3.5 points to 62.2%.Third  we are entering the last phase of the Borsa Italiana Group integration. In May  we have migrated the MTS Production Data Center to our core data center in Bergamo. In July  we have successfully migrated the clearing of Euronext's commodity derivatives to Euronext Clearing. And this successful first phase paves the way for our financial derivatives clearing migration  the very final step of our 2024 strategic plan  which will be accomplished and delivered in September 2024. This last step will complete our integration across our value chain and will deliver on the last remaining targeted synergies to reach €115 million of run rate EBITDA synergies in relation to the acquisition of the Borsa Italiana Group.So  we have been more efficient than anticipated in delivering this integration and we plan to limit cumulated implementation costs to €130 million by the end of 2024  compared to €160 million announced in '21.In Q2 2024  we also pursued a strategic bolt-on acquisition to further diversify Euronext's business model. We have closed  as you may have seen it a few weeks ago  the acquisition of Global Rate Set Systems  in short  GRSS  positioning Euronext as a leading player now in the calculation and administration of Interbank Offered Rate indices. This acquisition will strengthen the growth of Euronext's non-volume related revenues.Lastly  we have continued to innovate for the benefit of the attractiveness of European capital markets for our clients. In July  we pioneered with the launch of Euronext Wireless Network  our new microwave service. With this new offering  we became the first exchange in Europe to offer Plug & Play order entry in London via microwave technology to significantly enhance the speed of order transmission and offer unparalleled improvement in latency. Also  our Mid-Point Match initiative focused on dark trading is continuing its ramp up with increasing volumes month after month.Let me now give you a quick overview of the performance in the second quarter of 2024 on Slide 4. As mentioned earlier  Euronext reported a very strong second quarter of 2024  posting revenues of plus 12.2% year-on-year  up to €412.9 million. This growth was supported by three main drivers. First  non-volume related revenue posted a strong performance overall  notably in Listing and Advanced Data Services.We remain for the first -- we remain the first listing venue in Europe with 14 listings  representing 40% of European activity. A third of those 14 companies were coming from countries outside of Euronext's footprint. Advanced Data Services were driven by increased demand for fixed income and [electricity] data.Second  our trading revenue grew by plus 20.7%. This was driven by another record quarter of fixed income trading revenue growing by 40.7%  fueled by the ongoing volatility. It was also boosted by positive dynamics in cash  equity trading  as well as in diversified trading as commodity derivatives  power and fixed income trading -- and ForEx trading.Third  post trade combining clearing and [CAC] revenues grew by plus 16.9%. Euronext Clearing performance continued to benefit from the expansion of Euronext Clearing to cash markets across Europe and dynamic fixed income and commodities clearing activities as well. Euronext Securities also posted a very strong plus 9.4% increase in revenue this quarter  thanks to growth in custody and insurance.This translated into non-volume related revenue  accounting for 58% of the total Q2 revenues and covering 153% of underlying operating expenses  excluding D&A. As everyone appreciated  the share of non-volume related revenue is slightly lower this quarter year-on-year due to the strong dynamic this quarter of our trading and clearing activities described earlier.We continued our trademark disciplined approach to cost management. Q2 2024 underlying operational expenses  excluding D&A  reached €156.1 million and this is in line with the underlying cost guidance of €625 million for the full year  excluding D&A. Everyone understands that those numbers include OpEx to invest in organic growth projects to be deployed in the second part of the year.Consequently  our adjusted EBITDA grew by plus 18.8% to €256.8 million. Euronext adjusted EBITDA margin increased by 3.5 points to 62.2%. And this strong performance led to a plus 19% increase in adjusted EPS at €1.59 per share and to an adjusted net income of €165.2 million. On a reported basis  our EPS for the second quarter increased by plus 21.7% to €1.37.Our net debt to last 12-month adjusted EBITDA reached 1.8x at the end of June 2024. And this was impacted by the payment of our 2023 dividend of €257.3 million to shareholders at the closing of the -- and also the impact of the closing of the acquisition of GRSS. As I mentioned earlier  we are now entering into the final phase of the Borsa Italiana Group integration and our Growth for Impact 2024 strategic planning. At the end of June 2024  we reached €84.2 million of cumulated run rate EBITDA synergies out of the targeted €115 million by the end of 2024.In May  we have migrated the MTS Production Data Center to our core data center in Bergamo. This strategic move enables customers to access MTS Markets' Trading and Data services through the same facilities as all Euronext trading venues  enhancing efficiencies in European capital markets. And members benefit from reduced latency from the highest safety standards and from the reduction of their carbon footprint  thanks to the facilities in Bergamo that is powered by self-produced green energy.Most importantly  a few days ago  we have successfully migrated the clearing of Euronext commodity derivatives to Euronext Clearing  completing the first phase of our derivatives clearing migration. As of today  we only have one single remaining step ahead of us to complete the integration of the Borsa Italiana Group  and this is the expansion of Euronext Clearing to all financial derivatives listed on European markets that will be completed in September 2024  and this will be the final step to achieve the targeted delivery of €150 million of cumulated run rate EBITDA synergies at the end of '24. This will contribute to the integration of the European post-trade landscape to the benefit of our clients.Furthermore  the expansion of our clearing house will unleash new innovation capabilities and strategic organic growth opportunities for our clients  and I'm looking forward to sharing with you those innovation initiatives on our Capital Markets Day on the 8th of November 2024 in Paris.Finally  thanks to the efficient management of our integration projects  we now expect the cumulated implementation cost of the Borsa Italiana Group until the end of '24 to reduce to €130 million  and this is €20 million less than guided in May 2022 and €30 million less than this €150 million announced in 2021. Everyone appreciates that over the past few years  our targeted EBITDA for the integration of Borsa Italiana Group increased from €60 million to €150 million  and over the recent years  the implementation cost to deliver those numbers decreased from €160 million to €130 million.So  I now give the floor to Giorgio Modica for the review of our second quarter 2024.Giorgio ModicaThank you  Stéphane  and good morning  everyone. Let's now have a look at the strong performance of the second quarter of 2024.I'm now on Slide 7. Total revenue reached €412.9 million  up 12.2% compared to last year  out of which 58% are non-volume related revenues. We reported solid growth in both our non-volume related businesses and trading activities across all asset classes. Fixed income trading continued to be a key contributor to top line growth.Let me deep dive into the drivers of this strong performance  starting with listing on Slide 8. Listing revenue was €58.4 million  up 5.9%  driven by the strong performance of debt listing and of Euronext Corporate Services. Euronext sustained its leadership in equity listing in Europe with 14 new listings in the second quarter of this year. On the debt side  we reinforced our leadership worldwide with around 57 000 bonds listed on our platform. Euronext Corporate Services continues to deliver a solid growth with revenues of €12.8 million  up 8.8% compared to the same quarter last year.Slide 9 illustrates how data and investor services activity continued to drive growth this quarter. Advanced data services reached €60 million of revenues  up 5.4%  driven by the solid demand for fixed income and power trading data  as well as the continued strong demand from retail. Revenues include one month of consolidation of GRSS  which was acquired the beginning of June. Investor services reported €3.3 million in revenues in this quarter of 2024  representing a 17.7% increase compared to the second quarter of 2023  thanks to the successful commercial expansion of the franchise among the global largest investment managers.On the other hand  Technology Solutions reported €25.4 million of revenues  down 7%  mainly due to the termination of the double-run connectivity revenues following the completion of the migration of Italian cash and derivative markets to Optiq  creating synergies and efficiency for clients.Moving now to Slide 10. Euronext trading revenues reached €142.7 million this quarter  up 20.7%. As mentioned earlier  this strong growth in our trading revenues was driven by a good performance across almost all asset classes and especially fixed income trading. Cash trading revenue grew 13.8% to €74.2 million  reflecting increased volatility. Cash trading volumes grew 10.7% compared to the same quarter last year. Cash revenue capture averaged 0.53 basis points  despite the average order size remains still very high.Cash equity market share averaged 66%. Derivative trading revenue increased 6.6% to €13.9 million in the second quarter of 2024  reflecting higher financial derivative volumes  with ADV up 10.8% and the continued very strong performance of commodity derivative volumes  up 40.2% versus last year. Average revenue capture on derivative trading reached €0.32 per lot  affected by higher share of equity future in the volume mix. Lastly  FX trading grew 28.7% to €7.9 million of revenues in the second quarter of 2024  supported by the favorable volatility environment.Continuing the review of our trading activity  I'm now moving on Slide 11. Fixed income trading grew 40.7% and reached another record at €35.6 million in the second quarter of 2024. Our fixed income franchise continued to be supported by the favorable interest rate environment and good market volatility. It was especially driven by the strong performance of MTS cash with ADV up 67.7% year-on-year to €36.3 billion. MTS repo recorded €449 billion of term-adjusted ADV. Power trading revenue grew to €11.1 million in the second quarter of 2024  up 30.1% compared to the same quarter last year. This record performance was mainly driven by our intraday market  with ADV up 91.3%.I now conclude the business review with our post trade activity on Slide 12. Clearing revenue was up 33.2% to €39.2 million  reflecting the increased activity in equity clearing  following the expansion of Euronext Clearing to the cash market in Belgium  France  Ireland  the Netherlands  and Portugal and higher clearing revenues from the dynamic commodities and fixed income activity. Net treasury income amounted to €13.8 million in the second quarter of 2024  stable level compared to the same quarter last year.Lastly  revenue from custody  settlement and other post trade activity reached €69.7 million. This is a 9.4% increase year-on-year  reflecting growing asset under custody  which reached more than €7 trillion  and a dynamic issuance activity and higher settlement activity. On a like-for-like basis and at [current] currencies  custody  settlement and other post trade activity revenue was up 9.3% compared to the second quarter of 2023.Moving on with the financial review of the quarter  starting with the EBITDA bridge on Slide 14. Euronext adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was up 18.8% to €256.8 million  mainly thanks to an increase of €43.8 million of revenues at constant perimeter  offset only by €3.7 million of additional costs.The underlying operational expenses  excluding depreciation and amortization  increased 2.7% compared to the second quarter of 2023  reflecting continued cost discipline. This translated into an adjusted EBITDA margin of 62.2%  up 3.5 points compared to the second quarter of 2023. Non-underlying costs for the quarter were €6.9 million. I would like to take this opportunity as well to confirm our 2024 guidance for underlying cost  excluding D&A  at €625 million.Moving now to net income on Slide 15. Adjusted net income this quarter was strongly up at €165.2 million  which represents an increase of 15.6% compared to the second quarter of 2022 and despite the sale of our stake in LCH in the third quarter of 2023. This reflects the strong EBITDA growth in this second quarter of 2024 and the continued high interest rate environment  which led to an increase in net financing income of €5.3 million.Depreciation and amortization were €47.9 million  13.7% higher than in the second quarter of 2023 due to the completion of many migration projects and the related start of the amortization of CapEx linked to those projects. Income tax for the second quarter of [2022] was €55.7 million. This translated into an effective tax rate of 27% for the quarter. Minority interests were up due to the excellent financial performance of Nord Pool and MTS. As a result  reported net income increased 18.2% to €141.7 million  and adjusted EPS basic was up 19% in the second quarter of 2024 at €1.59 per share.I now conclude with some consideration on cash flow and leverage. In the second quarter of 2024  Euronext reported a net cash flow from operation activity of €111.5 million compared to €139 million in the second quarter of 2023  reflecting the movements in working capital related to Nord Pool and Euronext Clearing CCP activities  which accounted for minus €41.1 million this quarter.Excluding the impact on working capital from Euronext Clearing and Nord Pool CCP activities  net cash flow from operation activity accounted for 61% of EBITDA in the second quarter of 2024. Net debt to adjusted and reported EBITDA was at 1.8x at the end of the quarter  impacted by the payments of the dividend and the acquisition of GRSS  as mentioned by Stéphane.And with this  I would like to give back the floor to Stéphane Boujnah.Stéphane BoujnahThank you  Giorgio. As you have seen it  Q2 2024 clearly demonstrated that the benefits of our diversification strategy are coming through  translating into double-digit growth in revenue  double-digit growth in EBITDA  double-digit growth in EPS  boosted by non-volume related and diversified trading and post trade activity. Now that the integration phase is coming to an end  our efforts are focused on innovation for the benefit of the attractiveness of Euronext and European capital markets. We are advancing in the exploration of strategic opportunities  which I'm looking forward to take a deep dive into at our Investors Day on the 8th of November 2024 in Paris.Thank you for your attention. We are now ready to take your questions together with Giorgio  with Anthony Attia  Global Head of Derivatives and Post Trade  and with Nicolas Rivard  Global Head of Cash Equity and Data Services.Question-and-Answer SessionOperator[Operator Instructions] We'll take now the first question from Hubert Lam from Bank of America.Hubert LamI've got three of them  please. Firstly  on costs  it seems like you are on track at the first half of the year to beat your cost guidance for the year. Why are you maintaining your guidance now? Should we expect a step-up in the costs in the second half?Second question is on NTI. How should we think about this line going forward  as I think it should be benefiting from the clearing migration revenues. So  just wondering how we should forecast this -- NTI line?And lastly  just on potential for further bolt-on acquisitions  you acquired GRSS in advanced data services. Just wondering if you see any other potential interesting opportunities that you're looking for within data services that you could possibly pursue?Stéphane BoujnahThank you for your questions. I'll take the questions on M&A  and Giorgio will address your questions on cost and NTI. M&A is a tool. The objective is to accelerate growth and to accelerate diversification. Therefore  we are in a permanent monitoring of bolt-on acquisitions that can contribute to those two objectives  more growth  more diversification of our revenues.In this context  we had permanent dialogues  analysis of assets similar or bigger than the GRSS deal  obviously  with always the same M&A discipline about capital allocation  which is that we deploy Euronext capital when we are sufficiently confident that the return on capital employed after year three and five post synergies is above the work of the Company.Over to you  Giorgio.Giorgio ModicaYes. So  with respect to the cost  the reason why we maintain the €625 million is because as we have highlighted at the end of last year  we have a €10 million envelope  which is dedicated to growth projects and we will use that envelope mostly in the second part of the year. So if you combine the current trajectory of cost  plus the envelope  we are around the cost guidance.With respect to NTI  I would separate the impact in Q3 this year and after Q3 this year. For the next quarter -- for this quarter  you should not expect any major change In our P&L. There will be changes  but marginal. After that  you will observe a shift  i.e.  the net treasury income will increase of around €4 million  €5 million  whereas the revenues from clearing will reduce similarly by the same amount. The reason for that is that today  in our clearing revenues  there is a component linked to a retrocession of NTI that we received from LCH SA.So  to make a long story short  there is going to be  starting from the fourth quarter this year  a shift between NTI -- between clearing revenues and NTI. Clearly  we will make a little bit more than what is the current level of retrocession  but this is a small amount and included in the €115 million of synergies that we have already shared with the market.OperatorWe'll take now the next question from Enrico Bolzoni from J.P. Morgan.Enrico BolzoniSo the first one  again  is on clearing. There was a lot of conversation when you said you were going to migrate clearing about the proportion of volumes that you would have been able to migrate on your clearing premises. Clearly  you printed a strong set of numbers today. Can you give us an update in terms of what proportion of the volumes that were previously being cleared on LCH you managed to retain? Is there more to come  so we could see a further increase there? So that's my first question.My second question is  again  sort of on NTI  just one clarification there. So my understanding is that  at the moment  you are passing on to customer quite a big amount of the margin that is generated  partially because of pricing power. So I just wanted to understand if once you will have completed the migration of clearing  not only you expect to have greater volumes that clearly will increase the NTI  but also in a way  you expect to have greater pricing power that will allow you to retain a higher proportion of the interest rate that you generate?And then finally  just one update on the microwave technology  which clearly sounds quite exciting. Can you just give us some color in terms of how unique is to have this Plug & Play features? And can you give us an indication of the size of the addressable market in terms of what is the potential revenue pool out there by rolling out this technology?Stéphane BoujnahThank you. So  Nicolas Rivard will answer your question on the innovations that we have launched on the microwave technology offering. And Anthony Attia will answer your questions on the clearing migration  market share developments  and NTI revenue generation prospects. And Giorgio will compliment that part of the revenue generation in relation to NTI. Nicolas?Nicolas RivardYes. Thank you  Stéphane. Thank you for your questions on the microwave technology. It's a technology which I've been around for a number of years now  but used mostly by certain specific participants. What we have done with this partnership with McKay Brothers is to allow this technology to be widely accessible to brokers. So in -- why it is unique? So it bring London closer to Bergamo by almost 4 milliseconds  which means a small amount  but actually this is almost divided by two the latency between London and Bergamo. And why it is important? Because it allow brokers to be more efficient when they interact with our market.This offering is unique for three reasons. The first one is that we democratize this. Typically  when you want to use a microwave network  you need to buy a large chunk of bandwidth. The barrier to entry or the ticket to entry is pretty high. We basically split the bandwidth into small pieces to allow brokers to get access easily to this technology.Second  we did the IT development with McKay Brothers to allow it to be Plug & Play  which means you can use it as any net connectivity to route your orders. So you don't have to do internal IT to use this complex technology.And thirdly  it's 100% fully redundant  because it's completely seamless from the client  but in reality  we have a backup -- a total backup with a fiber and all orders are transmitted twice on microwave and on fiber. So it's a very unique proposition. We already  as you have seen in the press release  two clients connected  Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. We have other clients interested and the target of client are clearly brokers that are operating from London and are trading on Euronext.Anthony AttiaGood morning. This is Anthony speaking. Thank you for your question on clearing. Let me clarify a few elements. Our clearing house to the Euronext Clearing clears three different asset classes. One is cash equity; the second one is listed derivatives  including the commodity futures that we have migrated recently from LCH SA; and the third one is fixed income with Italian repo clearingThe competition with other CCPs for flow mainly happens on cash equity clearing. And for this  the migration was successfully performed last year in October and November. And through a very attractive value proposition on clearing fees and risk model  settlement fees  and client support. We have managed to retain a very  very strong market share from Euronext cash equity trade.On the listed derivatives  the clearing house captures 100% of the flows coming from Euronext markets that have migrated on our CCP. And to grow this business in the clearing house  we need to grow the volumes and the set of products coming from the market. And as Stéphane explained earlier  we will leverage on the clearing house migration to boost innovation and launch new products  and this is going to be detailed and announced in our strategic plan announcement in November.Giorgio ModicaWith respect to NTI  I want to highlight a few elements. The first one is that at the moment  our investment policy is extremely conservative  and that was appreciated by S&P that some quarters ago  when we changed the policy  reduced the negative notch in our rating  as you might remember. So  pretty much 100% of the collateral is invested at -- with [ECB].Now  going forward and in the short terms  our objective is to optimize collateral for clients and have our business growing. So  I'm not sure that the pricing power is going to be the first ambition to grow that business. We would rather attract more volumes and indirectly increase the NTI rather than increasing the NTI through capturing higher margin from clients.OperatorWe'll take the next question from Johannes Thormann from HSBC.Johannes ThormannThree questions from my side  please. First of all  we saw nice revenue momentum in power trading. How and will you benefit from the failed EEX-Nasdaq deal  or do you even see chances to get into talks with Nasdaq?Secondly  yes  on the strong clearing revenues  if I look at the numbers  it seems to be mainly driven by LCH-related businesses and not by Euronext businesses  which is actually seasonally down. Can you elaborate more how you want to capture this momentum seen at LCH when you migrate some of the business from LCH to Euronext?And last but not least  net debt/EBITDA level is nicely below 2x. If you don't use -- if it's decreasing and you don't use the free space for M&A  when do you see room for the next share buyback?Stéphane BoujnahI'll take the last question and the first question  and Giorgio will clarify the questions on the nature of the clearing revenues.On the capital allocation policy  we are very clear. Capital allocation is an output of investment decisions. Investment decisions are a combination of organic growth ambitions that need to be funded by CapEx and OpEx and organic M&A acquisitions that can contribute to the acceleration of growth and diversification. We are in the process of building a new strategic plan. This new strategy plan will be focused mainly on organic growth and will be presented to you at the beginning of November  for sure. Considering the very strong profile of our cash flow generation now that the Company is massively diversified with a double diversification  diversification of our trading revenues and diversification [away] of trading revenues.We will revisit our policy in terms of returning capital to shareholders  because the Company is different from what it used to be and the ambitions will be different from what they used to be in terms of growth and expansion. So  you should expect this particular issue where the share buyback is just one component of a much broader capital allocation ambition. You should expect this issue to be clarified very precisely at the Investor Day on the 8th of November.On the power trading dynamic  yes  Nord Pool is growing and expanding very quickly. The top line growth -- the top line of Nord Pool grew by 30% quarter-to-quarter and this growth is very impressive  through organic development across Europe  beyond the Nordic region. We are monitoring very closely the decisions  the consequences of the decisions of Deutsche Boerse and Nasdaq to put an end to their discussions and to the deal they are contemplating.This has some -- this creates some opportunities for Nord Pool and for Euronext power businesses more broadly. And we are monitoring that and exploring how we can offer to clients solutions that are appropriate or commensurate with their needs in this sector. So  definitely  a decision that will have consequences for all of us.On the clearing revenues  Giorgio?Giorgio ModicaYes  absolutely. Let me try to clarify that in two steps. So the first one  as Anthony said  we have now -- and what you see in the second quarter is the expansion of the equity clearing to pretty much all Euronext markets. But as far as derivatives are concerned  we will have access to 100% of the clearing when client decides to trade with us  because there is no open access for derivatives. So we do not anticipate any leakage.Then when it comes to the reasoning why you see the portion from LCH SA increasing  this is very simple. We have highlighted the exceptional performance of our commodities. Now  commodities are a rich product in trading  but even richer on clearing. So it is clear that with an increase of 40% of the volume traded and cleared  then the revenues in LCH because still in the second quarter  the clearing of commodity was done at LCH SA benefits from that.Having said that  as you know  we have already migrated the commodities. So  to a certain extent  that part is already done. And the next one is going to be completed in the second quarter of -- in the third quarter of 2024. So  to summarize  we don't anticipate any leakage and the reason why of the over-performance of LCH SA is simply linked to the over-performance of commodity in the derivative mix.OperatorWe'll take now the next question from Benjamin Goy from Deutsche Bank.Benjamin GoyYes. Benjamin Goy  Deutsche Bank. And two questions  please. One on clearing again  and you paid €35 million clearing expenses last year. So  how does that change going forward once you have insourced everything?And then just the second one on this €10 million growth envelope. Could you remind us what are your criteria for return on investment  which areas you will boost in particular  and about payback periods on that?Stéphane BoujnahSo  Giorgio will take those two questions. Could you be more explicit on your first question  to make sure that we understood?Giorgio ModicaIt's clearing expense.Benjamin GoySo the €35 million clearing expenses which you're paying to LCH  I'm wondering how this changes once you insource it...Stéphane BoujnahOkay. Very clear. Okay.Giorgio ModicaSo  let me take that question. So  today  we have a formula  which is as follows. We pay a fixed fee to LCH SA for their clearing activity  plus a percentage of revenues. So it is clear then the reason why you see clearing expense going up is because the overall revenues from clearing are going up.So  it's simple application of a formula with a fixed component and a variable component based on revenues. Then going forward  that the number will disappear  because there is not going to be any more retrocession and the clearing costs are going to be the Euronext costs. So  you would have to split by nature. So  you will have salary costs and everything else. But that specific line  we will not have it anymore.With respect to the envelope of €10 million  the answer is very simple. We are aiming to grow non-volume related activity  mostly related to services. And this is not linked  again  to additional cost of [our BAU]  but more to the expansion  mostly of our service activity. And this is in line with what we have announced last year  and we will focus more on that in the second part of the year as the migrations are really about to be over very quickly.OperatorWe'll take now the next question from Gregory Simpson from BNP Paribas.Gregory SimpsonYes  three questions. The first is in cash equity clearing. It looks like the clearing revenue per trade is about half the level it was before the migration. I'm wondering if there's the potential to increase that revenue yield over time  now you've got the volumes and market share?The second question is advanced data services revenue growth  like-for-like was 4%. That's a bit slower than where it was last year. Can we just update on what's the latest with kind of pricing and trends -- and trends there and outlook there?And lastly  I think you had 66% of Nord Pool and 63% of MTS in terms of ownership. Is there any appetite to increase the ownership  given the strong growth in these businesses?Stéphane BoujnahSo I'll take the last question and Giorgio will address the first two ones on clearing. We have minority partners at MTS and minority partners within Nord Pool for historical reasons. Within MTS  this is a legacy of users  owners  contributors to the MTS business being around the table. And for Nord Pool  this is a legacy of former owners who are clients and partners of Nord Pool.So  we have no plans to significantly change the presence of minority shareholders around the table  because this is part of the construct of the market architectures for those two asset classes. Here and there  we can increase our stake when there is a desire from certain minority investors to leave the equity of the Company  as we have done in the past for some minor stakeholders in MTS.But this is not a trend that will fundamentally evolve  and we have no plans and there is no desire of the minority shareholders to leave the Company. So it's -- a part of the success of MTS and a part of the success of Nord Pool is embedded in these strong partnerships with those minority shareholders.Giorgio ModicaYes. Then when it comes to your first question  you're absolutely right. The revenue capture is significantly reduced  but it is in line with our business case. So  what has happened is that we brought to Italian clients significantly more efficient level of fees  and more in line with European standards  and that was the plan since the beginning.So  pretty much before migration  you were seeing the way Euronext Clearing was operating on a purely Italian base. Now  on an international setup  this is the overall level of fees  which is again very in line with European market trends. So this is in line with the business case and we are happy with the current level. So  this addresses your first question.With respect to your second question  here  we see the trend of different components. So  what you have is a price increase  as you are aware  which happens once per year. And then the second variable is clearly the number of clients and the number of terminals.And here  what we see is a bit of a diverging trend where we see more interest from retail terminals and we start to see a mild erosion of the professional terminal. This explains why  to a certain extent  even if our price increases were in the mid-single digit type of increase  then on a like-for-like basis  we are slightly more than 4%.OperatorWe'll take now the next question from Bruce Hamilton from Morgan Stanley.Bruce HamiltonSorry  another one on the clearing business and costs for the full year. So  to understand  I get that if we sort of annualize the first half and add €10 million  we get €65 million of costs  which makes sense. But shouldn't you get some benefit from those LCH -- the cost you're paying to LCH dropping away? Or I know you incurred some costs to provide clearing  but wouldn't that still be a net gain in terms of the cost base in the second half?And then in terms of the treasury income linked to derivatives clearing migration  should -- I think the collateral pool's around €10 billion  but -- and shouldn't that drive an increase in NTI? You're saying that  that is completely offset by what you're currently getting from LCH that you will no longer receive. So  just to clarify  that would be helpful.And then in terms of the MTS business  obviously  very  very strong. Could you maybe help us understand a little bit about any sort of the impacts of BTP issuance in Italy and how that may fade versus the longer-term opportunity from internationalization and your ambitions there over the next two  three years? That would be very helpful.Stéphane BoujnahSo  I will cover briefly your last question  and Giorgio will answer your question on clearing costs and treasury income.MTS is growing extremely well  plus 40% year-on-year  because of the volatility around Italian sovereign bond instruments. And clearly  the Italian-related trading is still the most significant part of the MTS business. However  there are two developments that are starting to yield since MTS became part of Euronext.We have a cross-marketing program to make MTS closer to the debt management offices of all the countries where Euronext operates and where the focus on the primary dealers approach was more present than the appetite for electronic transplant platform. And some countries where we operate were close to MTS  others were not as close as in -- as they are today.In particular  one of the largest issuer of govvies in Europe is France  and the quality of the dialogue between MTS and Agence France Tresor has improved significantly and we are confident that in the context of the development of the French sovereign debt  we will be able to get more deployment of French assets on the MTS platform.The other development  which is more tangible  because it's real now  is the fact that MTS  thanks to the joint effort of the teams at MTS and at Euronext  was appointed as the ECN platform for the secondary trading of next-generation EU bonds  approximately €700 billion and €800 billion of European Commission issuance.And this is real  volumes are growing  and we have just started to charge clients at the beginning of July. So you will see in Q3 and Q4  the beginning of the revenue contributions of European sovereign bonds being traded on MTS platform. Volumes are there and they are growing significantly  but revenues are not yet there. You will see them in the future. I leave the floor to Giorgio for clearing costs and treasury income.Giorgio ModicaYes. So  on the clearing cost  let me try to clarify as much as I can. So  you're right. What is going to happen is that  at some point  the clearing cost will -- as mentioned in our P&L in the moment  will  to a certain extent  disappear once the derivative clearing arrangement is going to be terminated.However  on the other side  what is going to happen is that a part of the costs which today are accounted as non-underlying linked to what we call the double run  i.e.  the cost of running to platform in parallel  then those costs will go back to underlying costs. So you will have a positive impact coming from the termination of the DCA contract and negative impact coming from a shift from non-underlying to underlying costs.Clearly  the net result is going to be positive and part of the synergies  because reported earnings will go up and non-underlying cost will progressively trend to a very small number and potentially to zero. So  this is what is going to happen  and taking the consideration -- taking into consideration our projection  of course  for the next two quarters  again  we confirm the €625 million.Then when it comes to the NTI  as I said  in the LCH SA part of fees that you see highlighted in our presentation  there is a component linked to net treasury income retrocession. So there is going to be a shift -- the shift  as I said  then when you are dealing with numbers which are relatively small  €4 million  €5 million per quarter  this shift is not going to be completely neutral  i.e.  we are aiming to earn an additional spread from that  but it's not going to be that material.So again  I confirm a shift in between €4 million  €5 million from LCH cost to NTI  potentially with some additional margin on our side  but not material increase with respect to the current levels.OperatorWe'll take now the next question from Herve Drouet from CIC.Herve DrouetThree questions as well on my side. First one  with the T+1 settlement coming  do you think it will give you an opportunity to increase your tariff and pricing power with your clients? Is there some leverage there you think you can use in settlement and even potentially clearing? That's the first question.Second question  regarding competition  within the value chain where you currently are  where do you think which part could be more challenge in your view in the  let's say  two or three coming years? And what do you think about -- in the press  there were some articles about potential activities from Cboe [indiscernible] in the listing  for example  or indices provision?And finally  in term of -- where do you think you will expand further along? I mean  can you confirm it will be more in non-volume related business you are likely to expand  or is it going to be more geographically driven or more within the value chain?Stéphane BoujnahSo  thank you for your question. I'll address the question on competition and the question on diversification focus  and Anthony Attia will address your question on T+1 settlement implications.On the competition side  as you can imagine  the more diversified the business of Euronext is  and the business mix of Euronext is now extremely diversified  the more diverse and multiple the competition question is. Now  to take just one of the examples you have mentioned  on the cash equity trading business  we compete against Cboe  who is an aggressive player in Europe. But the hard fact is that  for the moment  our market share is increasing in cash equity trading and on listing  the leadership of Euronext is confirmed quarter after quarter.And some people may issue press releases and announce intents and ambitions. But when we look at hard facts  the market share of Euronext on cash equity trading is increasing and the market share of Euronext in listing is increasing. So that's for the competition as you have mentioned. Clearly  there is a similar dynamic for power trading  where the market share of Nord Pool is increasing across Europe. There is a similar a dynamic across most of our competitors -- most of our segments.When it comes to diversification  the focus of our non-organic growth  of our acquisition ambitions  is always the same. On the one hand  we want to capture any opportunity  if and when they become available  to deploy massive synergies by plugging on our single liquidity pool  single order book  single technology platform  other exchanges to add volumes to a single fixed cost base. And if we have an opportunity to do this type of consolidation in Europe in the core exchange business  we will do it.For the moment  there is no actionable situation and there is no winning seller of a material exchange in Europe. But we monitor those situations  because they change from time to time and sometimes  very quickly  as we have observed in 2020 around the Borsa Italiana situation  which was not for sale in January and February  and for which there was a sales process and auction process in June and July of the same year. So  that's for diversification. So that's for acquisition in the exchange world. That will be mainly focused on Europe.When it comes to non-exchange business  where the objective is not synergies  but diversification and growth acceleration  we are totally agnostic in terms of geography and we look every week  every month at assets with decision-making centers in the U.S.  decision-making centers in London. So we will continue to monitor assets in ForEx  in the advanced data services  in post trade  in all sorts of areas where we believe that we can be the legitimate owner and we can -- those assets can accelerate our growth or accelerate the diversification of our revenues  whether they are based in Europe or not.On T+1?Anthony AttiaYes. On T+1  so  as you know  it's a developing situation in Europe. We are working very closely with the market  with our clients and the authorities  and the association to set up an implementation planning that makes sense and to make sure that everyone is ready. So I think it's a little bit too early to answer your question about whether or not we see value in pricing power there. And so  we need to see how our clients look at our services. So  probably more to come next year on this one.OperatorWe currently have no further questions. So  I will hand you back to Stéphane to conclude today's conference.

It will also detail how restaurant chains are delivering against customer expectations and brand standards in the digital age.“With help from Ipsos  NRN will offer an exclusive look at where digital ordering stands today — and  importantly  how it could evolve in the future ” Oches said. “This study will be an important glimpse at the future of restaurant operations  one that brand leaders are sure to turn to again and again as they benchmark their own success.”Those brands interested in participating in the study should contact Brad Christian  head of strategic growth for Ipsos  at [email protected].ABOUT IPSOSIpsos is one of the largest market research and polling companies globally  operating in 90 markets and employing nearly 20 000 people.

Continue to article... The streaming service’s share price shot up around 14% on the NYSE Tuesday (July 23) in response to the news that it had achieved its second consecutive quarter of profit this year ,Spotify is a profitable company – and the markets are delighted.The streaming service’s share price shot up around 14% on the NYSE Tuesday (July 23) in response to the news that it had achieved its second consecutive quarter of profit this year  beating its own Q2 guidance for Premium subscribers  gross margin  and operating income.Spotify’s share price continued to rise on Wednesday before dipping a little on Thursday. At time of publication  SPOT’s market cap on the NYSE stands at USD $65.2 billion  around $23 billion bigger than Universal Music Group‘s equivalent market cap on the Euronext (~USD $42 billion at current exchange rates).According to new filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission  prominent Spotify exec shareholders have wasted little time cashing out stock following this share price bounce.MBW has spotted a filing with the SEC  dated Thursday (July 25) that reveals Spotify co-founder Martin Lorentzon is selling 255 000 ordinary shares  with an aggregate market value of USD $85.8 million. Goldman Sachs acted as broker for Lorentzon’s share sale.The sale is being conducted via Rosello Company Ltd.  a Cyprus-registered holding company owned by Almatea  a Luxembourg-based firm whose sole shareholder is Lorentzon. The vast majority of Lorentzon’s shares in Spotify are held via Rosello.This is the second time in the past couple of months that Lorentzon has cashed out some of his Spotify stock.In June  Lorentzon sold a separate clutch of 255 000 shares for $81 million in value.Over the past two months  therefore  Lorentzon has cashed out $166.8 million in Spotify stock across two transactions.According to Spotify’s latest annual report  Lorentzon was the third-largest shareholder in Spotify at the end of 2023  with 10.9% of outstanding shares  behind SPOT co-founder/CEO Daniel Ek (15.6%) and Edinburgh-based investment firm Baillie Gifford (12.0%).Lorentzon’s sale this week represents only a small percentage of his total share ownership. The 21 476 145 SPOT shares he owned at the end of 2023 would be worth around $7 billion based on the company’s share price at market close on Thursday (July 25).Lorentzon stepped down as Spotify’s board chairman in 2016 after eight years in the role.Lorentzon wasn’t the only Spotify exec to cash out a stack of stock this week.According to an SEC filing from Wednesday (July 24)  Alex Norström  Spotify’s Co-President and Chief Business Officer  is selling 78 218 Common shares with an aggregate market value of USD $26.4 million.Morgan Stanley acted as broker for the share sale.Meanwhile  Gustav Söderström  Spotify’s Co-President  Chief Product & Technology Officer is selling 52 788 common shares with an aggregate market value of $17.4 million  according to an SEC filing from Wednesday  spotted by MBW.Morgan Stanley also acted as broker for Söderström’s share sale.Katarina Berg  SPOT’s Chief Human Resources Officer  is selling 23 337 units of Common stock with an aggregate market value of $7.8 million  according to an SEC filing from Wednesday spotted by MBW.Morgan Stanley acted as broker for Berg’s share sale.According to Spotify  Berg “oversees all aspects of human resource management and is responsible for developing and executing the people strategy in support of our overall business plan”.Berg’s share sale arrives seven months after Spotify slashed around 17% of its global workforce  or 1 500 jobs  in a round of layoffs in December bringing the total number of employees cut from its worldwide payroll to 2 300 in the calendar year of 2023.Elsewhere  Ben Kung  Spotify’s VP of Financial Planning and Analysis and interim CFO  has this week sold 3 667 units of Common stock with an aggregate market value of $1.25 million  according to another SEC filing from Wednesday.Morgan Stanley acted as broker for the share sale.The Spotify executive windfalls outlined above  combined with the company’s record-high quarterly profit for Q2  paint a picture of a booming moment in time for music streaming at the world’s largest music subscription platform.Yet there’s another set of music industry stakeholders who might not be in as celebratory a mood this week.In an SEC filing published on Wednesday  Spotify estimated that it would have to pay out approximately $50 million if the Mechanical Licensing Collective (MLC) wins its bundling lawsuit.The MLC’s lawsuit was filed in May in the US against Spotify for allegedly underpaying mechanical royalties to songwriters and publishers as a result of its decision to reclassify its Premium tiers as ‘bundles’ because those plans now offer access to audiobooks.According to Spotify’s SEC filing: “If the MLC were entirely successful in this case  the additional royalties that would be due in relation to the period March 1  2024 to June 30  2024 would be approximately €46 million  of which approximately €35 million relates to the three months ended June 30  2024  plus potentially penalties and interest  which we cannot reasonably estimate.”Spotify added: “We intend to vigorously defend this lawsuit.”The €35 million [in royalties alone] Spotify cites for the three months ended June 30  2024 (i.e the second quarter of 2024) converts to $37.68 million.This  in turn  gives us an idea of the annual cost Spotify’s ‘bundle’ move will inflict on publishers and songwriters in the US vs. what they would have earned from the service under their previous royalty setup.If Spotify were to pay around $37.68 million (€35m) less in mechanical royalties per quarter following its bundle change in March  SPOT’s mechanical royalty payments would be cut by approximately $150 million over the span of a year following the change.Spotify co-founder and CEO Daniel Ek has not  so far  cashed out any company stock in the wake of the firm’s Q2 results.Ek has  however  cashed out a bunch of shares in recent months. In April  he sold 400 000 share units in Spotify  with an aggregate market value of USD $118.8 million.The move was the fourth time in the prior 12 months that Ek had cashed in some of his Spotify stock:In July 2023  Ek sold 675 000 shares for $100 million in proceeds;shares for in proceeds; In October 2023  he sold 400 000 shares for $64.2 million in proceeds;shares for in proceeds; And in February this year  Ek sold 250 000 shares for $57.5 million in proceedsAcross these four transactions (April’s included)  Ek has cashed out approximately $340.5 million in Spotify shares since last summer.Under a 2022 legal settlement called Phonorecords IV  music publishers and music streaming services agreed that ‘bundle’ services in the States are permitted to pay a lower mechanical royalty rate to publishers and songwriters than standalone music subscription services.The MLC is the non-profit organization designated by the US Copyright Office to ensure that Spotify and other streaming services pay the mechanical royalties they owe to songwriters and music publishers.Music Business Worldwide,neutral,0.08,0.86,0.07,mixed,0.36,0.29,0.35,True,English,"['record profit', '$150m royalty', 'Spotify', 'founder', 'stock', 'streamer', 'posts', 'songwriters', 'Gustav Söderström', 'largest music subscription platform', 'Chief Human Resources Officer', 'Mechanical Licensing Collective (MLC', 'prominent Spotify exec shareholders', 'The Spotify executive windfalls', 'human resource management', 'Alex Norström', 'Universal Music Group', 'latest annual report', 'founder/CEO Daniel Ek', 'Chief Business Officer', 'overall business plan', 'music industry stakeholders', 'second consecutive quarter', 'current exchange rates', 'Edinburgh-based investment firm', 'aggregate market value', 'equivalent market cap', 'Cyprus-registered holding company', 'record-high quarterly profit', 'total share ownership', 'share price bounce', 'Rosello Company Ltd', 'past two months', 'The MLC', 'largest shareholder', 'Chief Product', 'Technology Officer', 'music streaming', 'mechanical royalties', 'Exchange Commission', 'Luxembourg-based firm', 'past couple', 'two transactions', 'total number', 'profitable company', 'streaming service', 'Q2 guidance', 'Premium subscribers', 'gross margin', 'operating income', 'new filings', 'Goldman Sachs', 'sole shareholder', 'vast majority', 'second time', 'separate clutch', 'Baillie Gifford', 'small percentage', 'board chairman', 'eight years', 'Morgan Stanley', 'people strategy', 'global workforce', 'worldwide payroll', 'calendar year', 'Ben Kung', 'Financial Planning', 'interim CFO', 'booming moment', 'Premium tiers', 'additional royalties', 'three months', 'share sale', '255,000 ordinary shares', 'outstanding shares', 'SEC filing', '78,218 Common shares', '52,788 common shares', 'Common stock', 'US Securities', 'little time', 'bundling lawsuit', 'Katarina Berg', 'Spotify stock', 'Martin Lorentzon', '21,476,145 SPOT shares', '255,000 shares', 'markets', 'NYSE', 'July', 'response', 'news', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'publication', 'Euronext', 'MBW', 'broker', 'Almatea', 'June', 'close', 'role', 'stack', 'Co-President', '23,337 units', 'aspects', 'support', '1,500 jobs', 'round', 'layoffs', 'December', 'employees', 'VP', 'Analysis', '3,667 units', 'picture', 'set', 'celebratory', 'mood', 'May', 'songwriters', 'publishers', 'result', 'decision', 'bundles', 'plans', 'access', 'audiobooks', 'case', 'relation', 'period', 'penalties', 'interest']",2024-07-26,2024-07-26,musicbusinessworldwide.com

Despite the setback  Barco is optimistic about obtaining a new permit  as the Council did not outright reject the application and pointed out issues that can be remedied. The company remains committed to its renewable energy goals and plans to work with the licensing authority to strengthen its application.(PRESS RELEASE) KORTRIJK  26-Jul-2024 — /EuropaWire/ — Barco expresses regret over the annulment of the permit for a wind turbine at its Kortrijk site by the Council for Permit Disputes but remains optimistic about securing a new permit from the Flemish Government.The Council for Permit Disputes recently annulled the permit for a 4.5MW wind turbine at Barco’s industrial site in Kortrijk  which had been issued by Minister Demir. The Council has directed the Flemish Government to re-evaluate the permit application  highlighting the need for a more thorough examination and better justification for the permit decision.Barco regrets the Council’s decision but sees the retrial as a manageable process. The Council did not outright refuse the permit application  leaving room for the Flemish Government to address identified issues. The Council noted several deficiencies related to the spatial integration of the turbine within the industrial area and its buffer zone  issues that the Flemish Government can address. Additionally  the Council pointed out that the original permit was based on a 2014 circular on wind turbine bundling  which has since been updated by a 2023 circular prioritizing energy maximization. Barco remains hopeful that with further clarification and investigation  the Flemish Government can issue a new permit that meets the Council’s requirements.Project leader Kurt Verheggen stated  “Our initial reaction is one of disappointment. However  given the strength of our dossier and our unwavering commitment to renewable energy  we will continue to pursue our permit application. We will engage with the licensing authority to further substantiate our application.”Barco is determined to overcome this setback and remains committed to its renewable energy goals.About BarcoBarco  headquartered in Kortrijk (Belgium)  is a global company leading in visualization  networking  and collaboration technology.
