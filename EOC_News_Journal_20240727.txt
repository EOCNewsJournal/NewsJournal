44163,Euroclear,NewsApi.org,https://www.rt.com/news/601690-russian-assets-eu-ukraine-kremlin/,Kremlin vows response to EU’s expropriation of Russian assets,Moscow will take “well-thought-out actions” over the “theft” of the country’s sovereign funds  Dmitry Peskov has warned Read Full Article at RT.com,The transfer to Ukraine of proceeds from frozen funds will not go unanswered  Dmitry Peskov has saidKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has warned that Russia will retaliate against the West for its expropriation of the country’s sovereign assets.On Friday  European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen wrote on X (formerly Twitter) that the EU would transfer €1.5 billion ($1.6 billion) in proceeds from frozen Russian assets to Kiev for the “defense and reconstruction of Ukraine.”Commenting to reporters  Peskov said on Friday that the “illegal” actions would receive a “well-thought-out” response  fully consistent with the interests of Russia.“Of course  such steps by the European Commission will not go unanswered ” the Kremlin spokesman said.The West froze nearly $300 billion in assets belonging to the Central Bank of Russia shortly after the escalation of the Ukraine conflict in 2022. Most of the immobilized funds are being held in the EU’s largest depository and clearing house  Euroclear.In May  Brussels approved a plan to use the interest earned on the frozen assets to support Ukraine’s recovery and defense. Under the agreement  90% of the proceeds are expected to go into an EU-run fund for Ukrainian military aid  with the other 10% allocated to supporting Kiev in other ways.Last month  the Group of Seven nations also reached an agreement to use the interest earned on frozen Russian funds to finance a $50 billion loan to help Kiev buy arms and rebuild damaged infrastructure.This week  the EU announced that it would start sending the interest earned on the frozen Russian money to Ukraine.Moscow has repeatedly said that military assistance to Kiev only prolongs the conflict. The Russian government has also said that any steps taken to transfer its assets without its consent would amount to “theft ” insisting that tapping the funds or engaging in similar moves would violate international law and lead to retaliation.Peskov commented earlier this year that the expropriation of sovereign Russian assets could create a dangerous precedent and become a “solid nail in the coffin” of the Western economic system. He said Moscow would inevitably retaliate by launching legal proceedings against entities that do so.Russian authorities previously highlighted that lawsuits over immobilized Russian funds are underway in many countries  with some cases achieving success.,neutral,0.01,0.78,0.21,negative,0.0,0.28,0.72,True,English,"['Russian assets', 'Kremlin', 'response', 'EU', 'expropriation', 'European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen', 'Western economic system', 'Ukrainian military aid', 'sovereign Russian assets', 'military assistance', 'sovereign assets', 'Russian money', 'Russian government', 'Russian authorities', 'Kremlin spokesman', 'illegal” actions', 'Central Bank', 'largest depository', 'clearing house', 'EU-run fund', 'other ways', 'Seven nations', '$50 billion loan', 'damaged infrastructure', 'similar moves', 'international law', 'dangerous precedent', 'solid nail', 'legal proceedings', 'many countries', 'Russian funds', 'frozen funds', 'immobilized funds', 'Dmitry Peskov', 'The West', 'Ukraine conflict', 'transfer', 'proceeds', 'expropriation', 'country', 'Friday', 'Twitter', 'Kiev', 'defense', 'reconstruction', 'reporters', 'response', 'interests', 'steps', 'escalation', 'Euroclear', 'May', 'Brussels', 'plan', 'recovery', 'agreement', 'Group', 'arms', 'Moscow', 'consent', 'retaliation', 'coffin', 'entities', 'lawsuits', 'cases', 'success']",2024-07-26,2024-07-27,rt.com

The European Union is sending Ukraine €1.5 billion ($1.6 billion) from the proceeds of Russian assets frozen in the EU  to be spent on defence and reconstruction  von der Leyen announces on X. Philipp von Ditfurth/dpaThe European Commission announced on Friday that the European Union is making available €1.5 billion ($1.6 billion) to fund Ukraine's defence and reconstruction  financed by the proceeds of Russian assets frozen in the EU.""There is no better symbol or use for the Kremlin’s money than to make Ukraine and all of Europe a safer place to live "" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen posted on X.Most of the money - 90% of it - will be used to reimburse EU countries for military aid they send to Ukraine  while the remaining 10% will be paid directly to Ukraine as financial aid for reconstruction.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said ""such steps by the European Commission will not go unanswered.""EU foreign ministers approved the payments in late June. Germany and the Czech Republic were selected as the first to use the proceeds to provide Ukraine with air-defence equipment and artillery shells  diplomats said at the time.EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell said on X that ""the EU will stand by Ukraine for as long as it takes."" He noted that the €1.5 billion in aid will fund ""military capabilities and reconstruction.""The aid is financed by the proceeds - such as interest - from Russian Central Bank assets in the EU  but not by the underlying assets themselves  which remain frozen.""The immobilisation of the Russian Central Bank's assets is a result of EU sanctions against Russia  adopted in the wake of its war of aggression against Ukraine "" a commission statement said on Friday.""The extraordinary revenues generated in this context by the EU operators do not belong to Russia and are held by CSDs "" or central securities depositories. ""The EU has now started to channel these revenues to Ukraine.""The money has until this week been held by Brussels-based financial institution Euroclear. On Tuesday  Euroclear made it available to the commission  which in turn released it for Ukraine aid on Friday  the commission's statement said.The money is one of two sources of funding from outside of the EU budget that the bloc wants to use to fund Ukraine's defence. The EU budget itself cannot be spent on weapons of war.The other source is the Ukraine Assistance Fund (UAF)  a pot now worth more than €6 billion under the European Peace Facility (EPF)  an off-budget military aid fund paid into by EU member states.However  every member state has a veto over the EPF  and Hungary - which opposes arming Ukraine - is blocking the EPF payments  despite having allowed the creation of a dedicated budget for Ukraine under the EPF.Similarly  delicate legal footwork was needed to overcome Hungarian opposition to the use of the proceeds from the frozen Russian assets.The foreign ministers' approval of the actual payments in June followed an earlier agreement  in May  to the principle of using the proceeds to buy arms for Ukraine.A legal analysis concluded that because Hungary abstained on the May decision and the money is not from the EU budget  Budapest's veto did not apply to the decision in June.Gergely Gulyás  an aide to Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán  on Friday accused Ukraine of ""blackmailing"" Hungary because of its ""pro-peace stance"" by preventing oil deliveries to the country  according to an X post by the Orbán government's communications chief  Zoltán Kovács.According to the European Commission  around €210 billion worth of Russian Central Bank assets are frozen in the EU.

The new plan calls for the company to split into three distinct entities.One of these would be the newly named Louis Hachette Group  which includes Vivendi’s 63.5% majority stake in Lagardère  the parent company of Hachette Livre  and 100% ownership of Prisma Media  which is primarily a magazine publisher. The name honors Louis Hachette  the founder of the eponymous publishing group who  according to Vivendi  was also the ""inventor of the modern concept of travel retail and of one of the first general public leisure magazines."" This company would be listed on the Euronext Paris stock exchange.The other two companies would be the film and TV company Canal+  listed on the London exchange  and Havas  an advertising and communications conglomerate  to be listed in Amsterdam. A fourth entity  which would focus on investments  was part of the company's roadmap in December  but no mention of it was made in the recent update.For the plan to progress  it must be approved by various European legal and financial entities and then approved by a two-thirds majority of Vivendi shareholders at a meeting scheduled for December. Following the allocation of the shares of the entities resulting from the split  the Bolloré Group  a Paris-based business conglomerate with activities in energy and media  would hold approximately 30.6% of the share capital and voting rights of the Louis Hachette Group and Canal+.The proposal comes after Vivendi completed its majority acquisition of Lagardère last year  which led Vivendi to sell the French book publisher Editis in order for the European Union to approve the Lagardère deal. In all  Lagardère has 27 000 employees spread across 40 countries; it is the third largest trade and education publisher in the world  the first largest in France  and the second largest in the U.K.Late last year  in a major restructuring  Hachette Livre  the book publishing arm of Lagardère Group  brought together the U.S.-based Hachette Book Group and its U.K.-based counterpart  Hachette UK  under a new English-language management structure.",neutral,0.0,0.99,0.0,neutral,0.03,0.97,0.01,True,English,"['Conglomerate', 'Publisher', 'Hachette', 'U.S.-based Hachette Book Group', 'first general public leisure magazines', 'U.K.-based counterpart', 'Euronext Paris stock exchange', 'new English-language management structure', 'French book publisher Editis', 'book publishing arm', 'eponymous publishing group', 'third largest trade', 'Louis Hachette Group', 'other two companies', 'Paris-based business conglomerate', 'Lagardère Group', 'three distinct entities', 'various European legal', 'Lagardère deal', 'Bolloré Group', 'various companies', 'London exchange', 'Hachette Livre', 'Hachette UK', 'magazine publisher', 'education publisher', 'new plan', 'communications conglomerate', 'European Union', '63.5% majority stake', 'modern concept', 'travel retail', 'fourth entity', 'recent update', 'financial entities', 'two-thirds majority', 'share capital', 'voting rights', 'majority acquisition', 'major restructuring', 'Prisma Media', 'parent company', 'TV company', 'Vivendi shareholders', 'plans', 'December', '100% ownership', 'name', 'founder', 'inventor', 'film', 'Canal+', 'Havas', 'advertising', 'Amsterdam', 'investments', 'roadmap', 'mention', 'meeting', 'allocation', 'shares', 'split', 'activities', 'energy', 'proposal', 'order', '27,000 employees', '40 countries', 'world', 'France']",2024-07-26,2024-07-27,publishersweekly.com

Volatility in Digital Assets  as indicated by the BitVol index  was also down single-digits quarter-on-quarter but up by double-digits year-over-year.Trading Capital Expansion PlanIn recent years  Flow Traders has successfully diversified its core trading model into diversified asset classes and geographies  which resulted in increased optionality for the business. The Board sees a significant range of emerging opportunities to accelerate growth for the firm  stemming from the investments it has made in these new markets and through diversifying its revenue streams. It believes now is the time to seize these opportunities and move the firm into a growth phase by meaningfully expanding its trading capital base  especially given the strong historical returns it has made on trading capital.In recent months  the firm has been exploring various options to achieve this expansion in trading capital. It has concluded that the most cost-effective way to expand the firm’s trading capital base is to retain additional earnings on the Company’s balance sheet  as part of a multi-layered trading capital expansion plan.Revised Dividend PolicyAccordingly  the firm is suspending regular dividend payments until further notice  a decision that will accelerate the expansion of the trading capital base and that the Board is confident will generate long-term value for shareholders.External Debt FundingFlow Traders is also currently working on other parts of the plan and has recently secured a €25 million bank term loan as a first step towards embracing debt financing to unlock the growth opportunities the firm sees. Management is also actively exploring other debt financing options that will enable the firm to take full advantage of the opportunities it sees.Share Buyback€5.3m worth of shares were repurchased in 2Q24 as part of the €15m share buyback program announced in October 2022  with €2.2m of the program remaining. A portion of the shares to be repurchased under this program could be allocated to employee incentive plans as needed.OutlookFixed operating expenses guidance for the year remains unchanged and is expected to be in the same range as FY23 as headcount is expected to be flat to down for the year  offset by continued technology investments and inflationary pressures. The firm remains fully focused on operational and cost efficiencies across the business while implementing its growth and diversification strategies and bolstering trading capital.CEO StatementMike Kuehnel  CEO“Over the past 18 months  Flow Traders has made a concerted push into new markets  asset classes and geographies  with considerable success. Following the arrival of the newly constituted Board we have conducted a broad-ranging strategic review and concluded that we have a significant opportunity to capitalise on this period of development and move Flow Traders into a growth phase.A critical element of this development will be the expansion of our trading capital base  especially given the significant returns we have generated on trading capital historically. Following a review of the various options to achieve this  we are implementing a wide-ranging trading capital expansion plan. As a first element of this we recently secured a €25 million bank term loan  and we are looking at several other ways to increase external financing.We have also concluded that a central pillar of the plan  and the most cost-effective means of increasing our trading capital  is to increase the level of retained earnings in the business. Accordingly  we are suspending regular dividend payments until further notice  a move that will accelerate the expansion of the trading capital base and that the Board is confident will generate long-term value for the shareholders.We believe that the firm’s new trading capital expansion plan and the continued expansion of our diversified set of existing and newly emerging trading strategies will deliver significant returns and further strengthen Flow Traders’ role as a leading global trading firm  providing liquidity and efficiency across a wide range of financial markets.Coming to the quarter  market activity remained muted as volatility declined across most major asset classes compared to the same period a year ago. Nevertheless  we continue to expand our relationships across both the TradFi and DeFi ecosystems and actively sought out innovative partnerships to continue to support the adoption of Digital Assets.

Iqirvo® (elafibranor) has been recommended for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) in combination with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in adults with an inadequate response to UDCA or as a monotherapy in patients unable to tolerate UDCA. Kayfanda® (odevixibat) has also received a positive opinion from CHMP as a treatment of cholestatic pruritus in Alagille syndrome (ALGS) in patients aged 6 months or older. The European Commission will now consider the CHMP recommendations. Final decisions on marketing authorization for Iqirvo and for Kayfanda are anticipated in Q3  2024.“We are delighted to have received CHMP positive opinions for two potential new medicines in rare cholestatic liver diseases  on the same day. A rare achievement  and one that demonstrates our commitment to addressing the unmet medical needs in these diseases  said Christelle Huguet  Executive Vice President  Head of R&D. “PBC can progress to liver damage and even liver failure without effective therapies. Today’s decision takes us closer to being able to offer Iqirvo as a new treatment for patients  which significantly improves biomarkers that predict disease progression  without worsening symptoms. Also  with the positive opinion for Kayfanda we are moving forward in our efforts to provide a new treatment option for children with Alagille Syndrome  whose liver health can deteriorate rapidly and who often endure a very poor quality of life.”Iqirvo and PBCIqirvo is a first-in-class  oral  peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonist. Iqirvo was in-licensed by Ipsen from Genfit in 2021. The CHMP positive opinion is based mainly on data from the Phase III ELATIVE trial. The composite endpoint was achieved with results demonstrating statistically significant improvements in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and total bilirubin (TB)  biomarkers of PBC disease progression. For the key secondary endpoint using the PBC Worst Itch NRS score a trend towards improvement in pruritus (itch) was observed for elafibranor versus placebo  which was not statistically significant. Two other secondary patient-reported outcome measures were used to assess itch  and greater reductions were observed with Iqirvo compared with placebo at Week 52  according to the itch domain of PBC-40 quality of life questionnaire (LS mean difference -2.3; 95% CI  -4.0 to -0.7) and 5-D Itch total score (LS mean difference  -3.0; 95% CI  -5.5 to -0.5).1“PBC is a progressive disease with a high number of patients who either don’t respond or can’t tolerate the current available treatments. This can result in ongoing disease progression  which may not be picked up until the patient’s next doctor’s appointment  which can be as long as 12 months between visits in some cases ” said Professor Marco Carbone  Professor of Gastroenterology  University of Milano-Bicocca and Consultant Hepatologist  the Niguarda Liver Transplant Centre  Milan. “It is important that we not only regularly review our PBC patients to ensure the levels of alkaline phosphatase  or ALP  and bilirubin are within normal limits  but that we also discuss symptoms that might impair patients’ quality of life potentially leading to withdrawal from current treatments.”“It is helpful for people diagnosed with PBC to understand that disease progression is monitored through levels of biomarkers in the blood  such as ALP ” said Patient Advocate  Mrs Sindee Weinbaum from European Liver Patients’ Association. “Being aware of these levels helps the person living with PBC to be more in control of their condition and to have constructive conversations with their doctor about how to control their symptoms and about what treatment is right for them. This is important for people living with PBC who can sometimes feel unheard.”Kayfanda and Alagille SyndromeKayfanda’s CHMP positive opinion is based on the ASSERT Phase III clinical trial data  presented at the 2022 American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) congress and recently published in Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology.2 ASSERT is the world’s first and only Phase III trial completed in patients with ALGS. The data demonstrated efficacy of odevixibat in pruritus  a measure of treatment benefit  based on the worst scratching score using an observer-reported outcome instrument. Results demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements from baseline to month 6  in scratching severity  for odevixibat versus placebo  which was seen rapidly and maintained over the study period.“Effective and well-tolerated treatments that can manage the debilitating itch caused by Alagille Syndrome and reduce the concentration of bile acids in the blood  are of great importance in our management and care of children with this condition and it is a positive development that there may soon be a new treatment option available ” said Professor Henkjan Verkade  Pediatric Gastroenterology and Hepatology  Department of Pediatrics  University of Groningen  Beatrix Children's Hospital and University Medical Center Groningen  Netherlands. “This condition leads to multiple complications  it is however the intense itch experienced by these children and resulting sleep disturbances that is reported by the vast majority of people living with and caring for a child with liver disease due to Alagille Syndrome  as being the most significant.”In the ASSERT trial efficacy was also demonstrated on the key secondary endpoint showing a statistically significant reduction in serum bile acid concentration at the end of treatment for patients on odevixibat compared to placebo. Consistent with the improvements observed in pruritus  treatment with odevixibat led to significant improvements in multiple observer-reported outcome sleep parameters. The overall incidence of treatment emergent adverse events with odevixibat was similar to placebo  with a low drug-related diarrhea rate in patients with ALGS. All patients completed the study and 50 out of 52 patients have joined the extension study with all receiving odevixibat.2ENDSAbout PBCPBC is a rare  autoimmune  cholestatic liver disease  affecting approximately nine women for every one man. A build-up of bile and toxins (cholestasis) and chronic inflammation causes fibrosis (scarring) of the liver and destruction of the bile ducts. It is a life-long condition that can worsen over time if not effectively treated  leading to liver transplant and in some cases  premature death. PBC impacts patients’ daily lives through debilitating symptoms including most commonly pruritus and fatigue. Currently  there are no approved treatments available that can effectively manage both disease progression and life-impacting symptoms.About Iqirvo® (elafibranor)Iqirvo® (pronounced EYE-KER-VO) is an oral  once-daily  peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonist  which exerts an effect on PPARα and PPARδ  which are thought to be key regulators of bile acid (BA) homeostasis  inflammation and fibrosis. Pharmacological activity that is potentially relevant to Iqirvo therapeutic effects includes inhibition of bile acid synthesis through activation of PPARα and PPARδ. The proposed indication is for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) in combination with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in adults who have an inadequate response to UDCA  or as monotherapy in patients unable to tolerate UDCA. In 2019  Iqirvo was granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in adults with PBC who have an inadequate response to ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). UCDA being the existing first-line therapy for PBC. Iqirvo has not received approval by regulatory authorities outside of the U.S. Iqirvo is currently under regulatory review awaiting a final decision from the European Commission. It is also in regulatory processes with other authorities including the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). Iqirvo (elafibranor) was discovered and developed by Genfit and Ipsen licensed the exclusive worldwide rights (except China  Hong Kong  Taiwan and Macau) to elafibranor from Genfit in 2021.About ELATIVEELATIVE1 is a multi-center  randomized  double-blind  placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trial  with an open-label long-term extension (NCT04526665). ELATIVE evaluated the efficacy and safety of elafibranor 80mg once daily versus placebo for the treatment of patients with PBC with an inadequate response or intolerance to ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA)  the existing first-line therapy for PBC. The trial enrolled 161 patients who were randomized 2:1 to receive elafibranor 80mg once daily or placebo. Patients with an inadequate response to UDCA would continue to receive UDCA in combination with elafibranor or placebo  while patients unable to tolerate UDCA would receive only elafibranor or placebo. Patients continued their assigned treatment after Week 52 until all patients had completed their treatment or for a maximum of 104 weeks. Data was also collected during this period  and additional analyses were conducted with a focus on Week 78.In the trial  results show statistically significant improvements in the primary composite endpoint of biochemical response  defined as alkaline phosphatase (ALP) <1.67 x upper limit of normal (ULN)  an ALP decrease ≥ 15 percent and total bilirubin (TB) ≤ ULN at 52 weeks  with a significant treatment benefit demonstrating a 47% placebo-adjusted difference (P<0.001) between patients on elafibranor 80mg (51%) compared with patients on placebo (4%) achieving a biochemical response. ALP and bilirubin are important predictors of PBC disease progression. Reductions in levels of both can indicate reduced cholestatic injury and improved liver function.Only patients receiving elafibranor achieved normalization of ALP (upper limit of normal 104 U/L in females and 129 U/L in males) at Week 52 (15% vs 0% placebo  P=0.002)  a key secondary endpoint of the trial. The significant biochemical effect of elafibranor measured by ALP reduction was further supported by data demonstrating reductions from baseline in ALP levels were rapid  seen as early as Week 4 in the elafibranor group  and were sustained through Week 52  with a decrease in ALP of 41% on elafibranor compared with placebo.Elafibranor was well tolerated in the trial. Similar percentages of patients in the treatment group and the placebo group experienced adverse events  treatment-related adverse events  severe or serious adverse events or adverse events leading to discontinuation. Adverse events occurring in >10% of patients and more frequently on elafibranor versus placebo included abdominal pain  diarrhea  nausea  and vomiting.About ALGSALGS is an inherited rare  genetic disorder that can affect multiple organs including the liver  heart  skeleton  eyes and kidneys. Liver damage may result from having fewer than normal  narrowed or malformed bile ducts  which leads to a build-up of toxic bile acid  known as cholestasis and this in turn can cause fibrosis and progressive liver disease. Approximately 95% of patients with the condition present with chronic cholestasis  usually within the first three months of life and as many as 88% also present with severe  intractable pruritus or itch. The estimated global incidence of ALGS is 3 in 100 000 live births.About Kayfanda® (odevixibat)Kaydanda® (odevixibat) is a once-daily non-systemic ileal bile acid transport (IBAT) inhibitor being investigated in the E.U. for the treatment of cholestatic pruritus in Alagille syndrome (ALGS) in patients aged 6 months or older. Odevixibat was approved in June 2021 in the E.U. under the brand name Bylvay ®  as the first drug treatment option for all types of progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC) in patients aged 6 months or older  and in the U.S. under the brand name Bylvay®  as the first drug treatment option for patients 3 months of age and older living with cholestatic pruritus due to PFIC. Bylvay has received orphan exclusivity for the treatment of PFIC in the E.U. and in the U.S. In June 2023 Bylvay was approved in the U.S. for the treatment of cholestatic pruritus in patients from 12 months of age with ALGS and received orphan exclusivity for ALGS. In October 2023  while the EMA’s CHMP recommended the approval of Bylvay in ALGS  the EMA’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (COMP) recommended not to maintain orphan exclusivity in the E.U. for Bylvay in ALGS. In order to ensure sustainable access and availability for Bylvay in the approved indication for the treatment of PFIC  which is supported by orphan drug status  odevixibat for the treatment of ALGS has been resubmitted to the EMA under a new brand name  Kayfanda  without orphan designation and is currently awaiting a final decision from the European Commission.About ASSERTASSERT2 is a double-blind  randomized  placebo-controlled trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 120 µg/kg/day Bylvay (odevixibat) for 24 weeks in relieving pruritus in patients with ALGS conducted in 52 patients with 32 sites across North America  Europe  Middle East  and Asia Pacific.The trial enrolled patients aged 0 to 17 years of age with a genetically confirmed diagnosis of ALGS. In the primary analysis  the study met the primary endpoint showing highly statistically significant improvement in pruritus for patients on odevixibat as measured by the PRUCISION Observer-Reported Outcome scratching score (0-4 point scale)  from baseline at month 6 (weeks 21 to 24)  compared to the placebo arm (p=0.002). More than 90% of patients were pruritus responders (≥ 1 point change at any time during 24 weeks).The study also met the key secondary endpoint showing a highly statistically significant reduction in serum bile acid concentration from baseline to the average of weeks 20 and 24 (compared to the placebo arm p=0.001). Statistically significant improvements in multiple sleep parameters were observed as early as weeks 1-4 compared to patients on placebo with continued improvement through week 24.In the study  there were no patient discontinuations and 96% of patients rolled over into the open-label extension study. Bylvay had an overall adverse event incidence similar to placebo and a low incidence of drug-related diarrhea (11.4% vs. 5.9% placebo).The detailed recommendations for the use of odevixibat are described in the Summary of Product Characteristics (EU SmPC) and U.S. Prescribing Information (USPI)About IpsenWe are a global biopharmaceutical company with a focus on bringing transformative medicines to patients in three therapeutic areas: Oncology  Rare Disease and Neuroscience.Our pipeline is fuelled by external innovation and supported by nearly 100 years of development experience and global hubs in the U.S.  France and the U.K. Our teams in more than 40 countries and our partnerships around the world enable us to bring medicines to patients in more than 80 countries.Ipsen is listed in Paris (Euronext: IPN) and in the U.S. through a Sponsored Level I American Depositary Receipt program (ADR: IPSEY).

Iqirvo ® (elafibranor) has been recommended for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) in combination with ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in adults with an inadequate response to UDCA or as a monotherapy in patients unable to tolerate UDCA. Kayfanda ® (odevixibat) has also received a positive opinion from CHMP as a treatment of cholestatic pruritus in Alagille syndrome (ALGS) in patients aged 6 months or older. The European Commission will now consider the CHMP recommendations. Final decisions on marketing authorization for Iqirvo and for Kayfanda are anticipated in Q3  2024.We are delighted to have received CHMP positive opinions for two potential new medicines in rare cholestatic liver diseases  on the same day. A rare achievement  and one that demonstrates our commitment to addressing the unmet medical needs in these diseases  said Christelle Huguet  Executive Vice President  Head of R&D. PBC can progress to liver damage and even liver failure without effective therapies. Today's decision takes us closer to being able to offer Iqirvo as a new treatment for patients  which significantly improves biomarkers that predict disease progression  without worsening symptoms. Also  with the positive opinion for Kayfanda we are moving forward in our efforts to provide a new treatment option for children with Alagille Syndrome  whose liver health can deteriorate rapidly and who often endure a very poor quality of life.Iqirvo and PBCIqirvo is a first-in-class  oral  peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonist. Iqirvo was in-licensed by Ipsen from Genfit in 2021. The CHMP positive opinion is based mainly on data from the Phase III ELATIVE trial. The composite endpoint was achieved with results demonstrating statistically significant improvements in alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and total bilirubin (TB)  biomarkers of PBC disease progression. For the key secondary endpoint using the PBC Worst Itch NRS score a trend towards improvement in pruritus (itch) was observed for elafibranor versus placebo  which was not statistically significant. Two other secondary patient-reported outcome measures were used to assess itch  and greater reductions were observed with Iqirvo compared with placebo at Week 52  according to the itch domain of PBC-40 quality of life questionnaire (LS mean difference -2.3; 95% CI  -4.0 to -0.7) and 5-D Itch total score (LS mean difference  -3.0; 95% CI  -5.5 to -0.5).1PBC is a progressive disease with a high number of patients who either don't respond or can't tolerate the current available treatments. This can result in ongoing disease progression  which may not be picked up until the patient's next doctor's appointment  which can be as long as 12 months between visits in some cases  said Professor Marco Carbone  Professor of Gastroenterology  University of Milano-Bicocca and Consultant Hepatologist  the Niguarda Liver Transplant Centre  Milan. It is important that we not only regularly review our PBC patients to ensure the levels of alkaline phosphatase  or ALP  and bilirubin are within normal limits  but that we also discuss symptoms that might impair patients' quality of life potentially leading to withdrawal from current treatments.It is helpful for people diagnosed with PBC to understand that disease progression is monitored through levels of biomarkers in the blood  such as ALP  said Patient Advocate  Mrs Sindee Weinbaum from European Liver Patients' Association. Being aware of these levels helps the person living with PBC to be more in control of their condition and to have constructive conversations with their doctor about how to control their symptoms and about what treatment is right for them. This is important for people living with PBC who can sometimes feel unheard.Kayfanda and Alagille SyndromeKayfanda's CHMP positive opinion is based on the ASSERT Phase III clinical trial data  presented at the 2022 American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) congress and recently published in Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology.2 ASSERT is the world's first and only Phase III trial completed in patients with ALGS. The data demonstrated efficacy of odevixibat in pruritus  a measure of treatment benefit  based on the worst scratching score using an observer-reported outcome instrument. Results demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements from baseline to month 6  in scratching severity  for odevixibat versus placebo  which was seen rapidly and maintained over the study period.Effective and well-tolerated treatments that can manage the debilitating itch caused by Alagille Syndrome and reduce the concentration of bile acids in the blood  are of great importance in our management and care of children with this condition and it is a positive development that there may soon be a new treatment option available  said Professor Henkjan Verkade  Pediatric Gastroenterology and Hepatology  Department of Pediatrics  University of Groningen  Beatrix Children's Hospital and University Medical Center Groningen  Netherlands. This condition leads to multiple complications  it is however the intense itch experienced by these children and resulting sleep disturbances that is reported by the vast majority of people living with and caring for a child with liver disease due to Alagille Syndrome  as being the most significant.In the ASSERT trial efficacy was also demonstrated on the key secondary endpoint showing a statistically significant reduction in serum bile acid concentration at the end of treatment for patients on odevixibat compared to placebo. Consistent with the improvements observed in pruritus  treatment with odevixibat led to significant improvements in multiple observer-reported outcome sleep parameters. The overall incidence of treatment emergent adverse events with odevixibat was similar to placebo  with a low drug-related diarrhea rate in patients with ALGS. All patients completed the study and 50 out of 52 patients have joined the extension study with all receiving odevixibat.2ENDSAbout PBCPBC is a rare  autoimmune  cholestatic liver disease  affecting approximately nine women for every one man. A build-up of bile and toxins (cholestasis) and chronic inflammation causes fibrosis (scarring) of the liver and destruction of the bile ducts. It is a life-long condition that can worsen over time if not effectively treated  leading to liver transplant and in some cases  premature death. PBC impacts patients' daily lives through debilitating symptoms including most commonly pruritus and fatigue. Currently  there are no approved treatments available that can effectively manage both disease progression and life-impacting symptoms.About Iqirvo ® (elafibranor)Iqirvo ® (pronounced EYE-KER-VO) is an oral  once-daily  peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonist  which exerts an effect on PPARÎ± and PPARÎ´  which are thought to be key regulators of bile acid (BA) homeostasis  inflammation and fibrosis.

Actual results may depart significantly from these targets given the occurrence of certain risks and uncertainties  notably the fact that a promising medicine in early development phase or clinical trial may end up never being launched on the market or reaching its commercial targets  notably for regulatory or competition reasons. Ipsen must face or might face competition from generic medicine that might translate into a loss of market share. Furthermore  the research and development process involves several stages each of which involves the substantial risk that Ipsen may fail to achieve its objectives and be forced to abandon its efforts with regards to a medicine in which it has invested significant sums. Therefore  Ipsen cannot be certain that favorable results obtained during preclinical trials will be confirmed subsequently during clinical trials  or that the results of clinical trials will be sufficient to demonstrate the safe and effective nature of the medicine concerned. There can be no guarantees a medicine will receive the necessary regulatory approvals or that the medicine will prove to be commercially successful. If underlying assumptions prove inaccurate or risks or uncertainties materialize  actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward-looking statements. Other risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to  general industry conditions and competition; general economic factors  including interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations; the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and healthcare legislation; global trends toward healthcare cost containment; technological advances  new medicine and patents attained by competitors; challenges inherent in new-medicine development  including obtaining regulatory approval; Ipsen's ability to accurately predict future market conditions; manufacturing difficulties or delays; financial instability of international economies and sovereign risk; dependence on the effectiveness of Ipsen's patents and other protections for innovative medicines; and the exposure to litigation  including patent litigation  and/or regulatory actions. Ipsen also depends on third parties to develop and market some of its medicines which could potentially generate substantial royalties; these partners could behave in such ways which could cause damage to Ipsen's activities and financial results. Ipsen cannot be certain that its partners will fulfil their obligations. It might be unable to obtain any benefit from those agreements. A default by any of Ipsen's partners could generate lower revenues than expected. Such situations could have a negative impact on Ipsen's business  financial position or performance. Ipsen expressly disclaims any obligation or undertaking to update or revise any forward-looking statements  targets or estimates contained in this press release to reflect any change in events  conditions  assumptions or circumstances on which any such statements are based  unless so required by applicable law. Ipsen's business is subject to the risk factors outlined in its registration documents filed with the French AutoritÃ© des MarchÃ©s Financiers. The risks and uncertainties set out are not exhaustive and the reader is advised to refer to Ipsen's latest Universal Registration Document  available on ipsen.com.ReferencesKowdley. K.V  et al.

Or local equivalentOUTLOOKSEGRO has one of the best and most modern industrial and logistics portfolios in Europe  with two-thirds of our invested capital (at share) representing urban warehouses (including our data centre portfolio) located in Europe's largest cities  and one-third representing big box warehouses located in major logistics hubs and along key transportation corridors.These assets are in high demand from occupiers  driven by the long-term structural drivers at play in our sector - digitalisation  supply-chain resilience  urbanisation and sustainability - and the locations we operate in have a shortage of modern  sustainable space due to low availability of land  restrictive planning policies and  more recently  a significant fall in speculative construction starts across Europe.Our portfolio is well-positioned to benefit from this tight supply-demand dynamic and we believe that this  combined with an improving macroeconomic situation  will support higher take-up levels and help to drive continued rental growth in line with our medium-term expectations.This rental growth is expected to add to the £133 million of future additional income that is already underpinned by rent reversion within our existing portfolio  equating to approximately 20 per cent of our rent roll that we are successfully capturing whilst keeping customer retention high. Our high-quality land bank also creates the potential to add a further £404 million of rental income through development  which includes a sizeable data centre opportunity.Asset values appear to be at an inflection point in the UK and bottoming out in Continental Europe  and the prospect of interest rate cuts later in the second half should provide support for continued recovery in investment market conditions. We believe this will present further  exciting opportunities for SEGRO to drive future returns.Overall  we believe the present market environment offers an attractive opportunity for profitable medium-term investment. SEGRO  with the benefit of its prime portfolio  excellent land bank  market-leading operating platform and strong balance sheet  is well-placed to deliver attractive returns and continued compounding growth in earnings and dividends.WEBCAST / CONFERENCE CALL FOR INVESTORS AND ANALYSTSA live webcast of the results presentation will be available from 08:30am (UK time) at:https://www.investis-live.com/segro/66714879c5e2640c000ef5ed/qpaerThe webcast will be available for replay at SEGRO's website at: http://www.segro.com/investors shortly after the live presentation.A conference call facility will be available at 08:30 (UK time) on the following number: Dial-in: +44 (0)800 279 3956 +44 (0)207 107 0613 Access code: 43520861 An audio recording of the conference call will be available until 2 August 2024 on: UK: +44 (0)203 608 8021 Access code: 43520861#A video of David Sleath  Chief Executive discussing the results will be available to view on www.segro.com  together with this announcement  the Half Year 2024 Property Analysis Report and other information about SEGRO.CONTACT DETAILS FOR INVESTOR / ANALYST AND MEDIA ENQUIRIES:SEGRO Soumen Das (Chief Financial Officer) Tel: + 44 (0) 20 7451 9110(after 11am) Claire Mogford (Head of Investor Relations) Mob: +44 (0) 7710 153 974 Tel: +44 (0) 20 7451 9048(after 11am) FTI Consulting (NYSE: ) Richard Sunderland/ Ellie Sweeney/ Eve Kirmatzis Tel: +44 (0) 20 3727 1000FINANCIAL CALENDAR2024 interim dividend ex-div date 8 August 2024 2024 interim dividend record date 9 August 2024 2024 interim dividend scrip dividend price announced 15 August 2024 Last date for scrip dividend elections 30 August 2024 2024 interim dividend payment date 20 September 2024 2024 Third Quarter Trading Update 17 October 2024 Full Year 2024 Results (provisional) 14 February 2025ABOUT SEGROSEGRO is a UK Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT)  listed on the London Stock Exchange and Euronext Paris  and is a leading owner  manager and developer of modern warehouses and industrial property.

The Board of Directors of Vallourec SA  meeting on July 25th 2024  approved the Group's second quarter 2024 Consolidated Financial Statements.Second Quarter 2024 ResultsQ2 2024 EBITDA of €215m was moderately down sequentially  as expectedQ2 2024 results reflect strong QoQ recovery in international Tubes volumes  more than offset by weaker US Tubes prices and volumesSeveral significant initiatives underway to realize full earnings potential in BrazilInternational OCTG demand remains at a healthy level and pricing remains strongNet debt reduction remains ahead of plan; further reduced to €364 millionExpect further total cash generation in H2 2024  to be allocated predominantly to shareholder returns in 2025 at the latestaHIGHLIGHTSSecond Quarter 2024 ResultsGroup EBITDA of €215 million (down €20m QoQ) with EBITDA margin of 20% Tubes EBITDA per tonne of €599  above €550 for the seventh straight quarter despite reduced US pricing Tubes EBITDA of €210 million down 4% sequentially and 36% year over year Mine & Forest EBITDA of €15 million down 49% sequentially and 69% year over year due to lower realized prices and lower volumes year over yearAdjusted free cash flow €81 million; total cash generation €41 millionDeleveraging remains ahead of plan: net debt declined €121 million sequentially to €364 millionThird Quarter 2024 OutlookbGroup EBITDA to decline versus Q2 due to lower overall Tubes volumes and reduced US Tubes pricingExpect positive total cash generation and further net debt reduction versus the Q2 2024 levelFull Year 2024 OutlookGroup EBITDA expected to range between €800 – €850 million due to lower US pricesExpect positive total cash generation and further net debt reduction versus the Q2 2024 levelPhilippe Guillemot  Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer  declared:“Our second-quarter results continued to reflect Vallourec’s significant transformation into a more profitable  resilient and cash-generative company. Our Tubes EBITDA margin exceeded 20% for the fifth time in the last six quarters despite significantly weaker market conditions in the US versus early 2023. In addition  our total cash generation was positive for the seventh consecutive quarter  enabling us to remain ahead of plan in terms of net debt reduction.“We are convinced that there remain significant opportunities to improve our Tubes returns independent of overall OCTG market conditions. In particular  we have several initiatives underway to drive our Brazilian Tubes operations towards best-in-class levels of efficiency and profitability. Today  we announce our plan to close our oldest rolling mill  the Barreiro Plug millc  which will save on cost and capex without sacrificing future volume upside. We are further reducing operating complexity and costs at our remaining operations with the goal of improving Brazilian Tubes cost per tonne by over €150 by year-end 2025. We also believe that this asset base retains the potential to deliver over 100 000 tonnes of incremental premium volume as we capitalize on future demand and improve our production efficiency. d“Also in Brazil  we recently announced that we have obtained the necessary approvals from the state environmental authority (COPAM) and federal mining regulator (ANM) to progress the mine’s Phase 1 extension project. This project  expected to start in late 2024  will extend the iron ore mine’s life  improve its reserve quality  and enhance its profitability. We also are engaging with the relevant parties to progress the Phase 2 extension  which is still slated for startup in 2027.“International OCTG market dynamics remain strong. Over the past several months  Vallourec has been awarded several contracts in the Middle East  Brazil and Africa to deliver premium tubular solutions to top global customers over the coming years. Additionally  customer tendering activity remains high  and we are confident in our ability to win attractive new business in the coming months. Our pricing for new orders remains at a healthy level  in line with strong global drilling activity levels.“In the US market  OCTG prices have remained pressured by weaker than expected demand in 2024. We have remained disciplined in our pricing strategy and have taken action to offset these price headwinds via reduced staffing and sourcing costs. We see medium-term upside to demand as operators seek to maintain their currently-high level of oil and gas production in the years ahead.“With our balance sheet refinancing completed and our net debt level now within our target leverage range  we are in a resilient position for any market environment. We expect further total cash generation in the second half of 2024  which will be predominantly allocated to shareholder returns in 2025 at the latest. e”Key Quarterly Datain € million  unless noted Q2 2024 Q1 2024 Q2 2023 QoQ chg.

The decrease in Group revenues reflects:(12%) volume decrease mainly driven by the closure of the European rolling mills and decreased volume sold in North America(7%) price/mix effect(1%) Mine & Forest effect(0.3%) currency effectEBITDA amounted to €215 million  or 19.8% of revenues  compared to €374 million (27.5% of revenues) in Q2 2023. The decrease was largely driven by lower average selling prices in Tubes in North America  partially offset by improved Tubes results outside of North America due to higher market pricing and the benefits of the New Vallourec plan.Operating income was €100 million  compared to €258 million in Q2 2023. Operating income was burdened by (€65) million of asset disposals  restructuring costs and non-recurring items  largely due to costs related to the closure of Vallourec’s German operations.Financial income (loss) was positive at €57 million  compared to (€24) million in Q2 2023. Net interest income in Q2 2024 was €37 million compared to (€28) million in Q2 2023. Vallourec’s balance sheet refinancing had a net positive impact of approximately €70 million mainly related to the reversal of fair value accounting on the 2026 senior notes and State-guaranteed loan (PGE)  of which €44 million impacted interest income.Income tax amounted to (€40) million compared to (€70) million in Q2 2023.This resulted in positive net income  Group share  of €111 million  compared to €159 million in Q2 2023.Earnings per diluted share was €0.46 versus €0.67 in Q2 2023  reflecting the above changes in net income as well as an increase in potentially dilutive shares largely related to the Company’s outstanding warrants  which are accounted for using the treasury share method.First Half Results AnalysisIn H1 2024  Vallourec recorded revenues of €2 075 million  down (23%) year over year  which was also (23%) at constant exchange rates. The decrease in Group revenues reflects:(22%) volume decrease mainly driven by the decrease in Industry volumes following the closure of the European rolling mills and by lower volumes in Oil & Gas Tubes in North America0.4% price/mix effect(1%) Mine and Forest effect(0.1%) currency effectEBITDA amounted to €450 million  or 21.7% of revenues  compared to €694 million (25.7% of revenues) in H1 2023. The decrease was largely driven by lower average selling prices in Tubes in North America  partly offset by improved Tubes results outside of North America due to higher market pricing and the benefits of the New Vallourec plan.Operating income was €273 million  compared to €514 million in H1 2023. Operating income was burdened by (€77) million of asset disposals  restructuring costs and non-recurring items  largely due to costs related to the closure of Vallourec’s German operations.Financial income (loss) was positive at €37 million  compared to (€70) million in H1 2023. Net interest income in H1 2024 was €23 million compared to (€54) million in H1 2023.

This decrease in volumes was largely attributable to the closure of Vallourec’s German rolling operations as a result of the New Vallourec plan and decreased shipments in North America. Tubes EBITDA decreased from €330 million in Q2 2023 to €210 million Q2 2024 due to lower profitability in North America offset by improvements in the rest of the world due to higher market pricing and the benefits of the New Vallourec plan.Mine & Forest: In Q2 2024  iron ore production sold was 1.4 million tonnes  a decrease of 0.5 million tonnes year over year. In Q2 2024  Mine & Forest EBITDA reached €15 million  versus €50 million in Q2 2023  reflecting lower sales volumes  realized price  and non-cash forest fair value revaluation effects and higher costs.First Half Results AnalysisTubes: In H1 2024  Tubes revenues were down 23% year over year due to a 22% reduction in volume sold. This decrease in shipments was largely attributable to the closure of Vallourec’s German rolling operations as a result of the New Vallourec plan and decreased volume sold in North America. Tubes EBITDA decreased from €609 million in H1 2023 to €430 million H1 2024 due to a decrease in profitability in North America offset by improvement in the rest of the world due to higher market pricing and the benefits of the New Vallourec plan.Mine & Forest: In H1 2024  iron ore production sold was 2.8 million tonnes  decreasing by 0.6 million tonnes year over year. In H1 2024  Mine & Forest EBITDA reached €46 million  versus €98 million in H1 2023  largely reflecting lower sales volumes  realized price  and non-cash forest fair value revaluation effects and higher costs.CASH FLOW AND FINANCIAL POSITIONSecond Quarter Cash Flow AnalysisIn Q2 2024  adjusted operating cash flow was €96 million versus €232 million in Q2 2023. The decrease was attributable to lower EBITDA. Financial cash out in the period included approximately (€10) million of one-time costs related to the balance sheet refinancing.Adjusted free cash flow was €81 million  versus €174 million in Q2 2023. Lower adjusted operating cash flow was partially offset by reduced capex versus the prior year period.Total cash generation in Q2 2024 was €41 million  versus €118 million in Q2 2023. The decrease was attributable to lower adjusted free cash flow as well as higher restructuring charges and non-recurring items.First Half Cash Flow AnalysisIn H1 2024  adjusted operating cash flow was €330 million versus €531 million in H1 2023. The decrease was attributable to lower EBITDA  partly offset by reduced financial cash out. Financial cash out in the period included approximately (€10) million of one-time costs related to the balance sheet refinancing.Adjusted free cash flow was €253 million  versus €368 million in H1 2023. Lower adjusted operating cash flow was partially offset by a release in working capital and lower capex versus the prior year period.Total cash generation in H1 2024 was €143 million  versus €269 million in H1 2023. The decrease was attributable to lower adjusted free cash flow as well as higher restructuring charges and non-recurring items.Net Debt and LiquidityAs of June 30  2024  net debtf stood at €364 million  a significant decrease compared to €868 million on June 30  2023. Gross debt was €1 082 million  down from €1 724 million on June 30  2023. Long-term debt was €772 million and short-term debt totaled €310 million. There were €80m of non-cash reductions to net debt in Q2  which included €44 million of fair value adjustments related to the April balance sheet refinancing.As of June 30  2024  the liquidity position was very strong at €1 498 million  with €720 million of cash  availability on our revolving credit facility (RCF) of €550 million  and availability on an asset-backed lending facility (ABL) of €228 milliong. Both liquidity facilities were upsized and extended in Vallourec’s April balance sheet refinancing.THIRD QUARTER AND FULL YEAR 2024 OUTLOOKHIn the third quarter of 2024  based on our assumptions and current market conditions  Vallourec expects:Group EBITDA to decline versus Q2  with: Tubes volumes to decrease sequentially driven by lower US volumes and a Q4-weighted international shipment schedule US Tubes prices to be lower in Q3 versus Q2 Iron ore production sold to increase sequentiallyTotal cash generation to be positive and net debt to further decline versus the Q2 2024 levelFor the full year 2024  based on our assumptions and current market conditions  Vallourec expects:Group EBITDA to range between €800 – €850 million  driven by: A persistently strong international Tubes market environment  more than offset by lower US Tubes demand and pricing Iron ore production sold of approximately 6 million tonnes  leading to full year EBITDA of approximately €100 million iDeleveraging to remain ahead of schedule with positive total cash generation positive and further net debt reduction versus the Q2 2024 levelKey items affecting Vallourec’s cash flow in 2024 are as follows:Financial cash out is expected to be approximately (€100) millionTax payments are expected to reflect a low-to-mid 20% cash tax rate relative to reported pre-tax income  down from the previous expectation of a mid-to-high 20% cash tax rate relative to reported pre-tax incomeCapital expenditures are expected to be less than (€200) million  down from the previous expectation of approximately (€200) millionRestructuring charges and non-recurring items are expected to represent a net cash use of approximately (€250) million. This estimate has increased from a previous estimate of a (€200) million cash use and includes offsetting proceeds from minor equipment sales  changes in cash collateral and other cash items. jThe potential positive impact of major asset sales continues to be excluded from any cash flow or net debt outlook.Accounting for the above factors  we expect positive total cash generation in the second half of 2024  allowing us to remain ahead of schedule in our net debt reduction plan.Information and Forward-Looking StatementsThis press release includes forward-looking statements.

Thank you. Sir Lucian  you may begin your conference.Lucian Grainge: Thank you  and hello to everyone  and big greetings live from us in Hilversum. I'm pleased to share with you UMG's results for the second quarter of 2024. We have once again achieved solid growth with revenue up 10% and adjusted EBITDA up 11%. More telling is that  it was the 12th consecutive quarter of at least high single-digit revenue growth for us  since the initial listing on the EURONEXT almost three years ago. This was also our seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit increase in adjusted EBITDA. Our ability to deliver sustainable growth like this quarter-after-quarter is a product of how we've designed UMG. Simply put  we are a multifaceted music entertainment company. We have a wide ranging variety of revenue streams across both traditional and non-traditional businesses and including both established and emerging ones. The creative and commercial efforts of these businesses are as varied and exciting as the countries and the regions in which they are located and from where they operate. Today  I'm going to focus on these three areas: first  how the diversity of our revenue streams propels us towards continued sustainable growth. Second  the undeniably stellar recent achievements of our artists  both new and established and third  how we are approaching both the challenges and the opportunities presented by the rapid advance of AI. So to begin  how the diversity of our revenue streams propels our growth. This management team has decades of experience growing UMG into the most successful  diversified and profitable music company in history. Throughout this journey of long-term growth  we know that quarterly fluctuations in one source of revenue or another are to be expected. So while we report results quarterly  we manage the business for long-term success. We think in multi-year cycles and anticipate and embrace variations in certain business lines. For example  our second quarter results reflect the varied performances of our diverse portfolio of DSP partners. Their performances  some more positive than others  vary as a consequence as they're having different strategies for growth  different consumer engagement dynamics  different regional strengths and their own unique product roadmaps for their subscription and ad supported offerings. Boyd will discuss this further later  but overall  our optimism about our DSP partners' near and long-term prospects as well as the continued headroom for growth in established markets is fortified by a number of factors. Our proactive approach to working together in driving both subscription and ad supported revenues  the development in the pipeline of new products and offerings  the growth we anticipate from continued technology trends driving consumer adoption and powering the geographic expansion of all that we do. The escalating positive results of our artist-centric initiative  which is still in its early stages. And our deep long-term relationships and networks within the tech community and with the DSPs where we've demonstrated our ability to create win-win solutions for everybody. Further  while our increasing array of DSP partners represents an important source of growing revenue streams  other important sources of revenues are continuing to grow as well. Product innovation is not limited to what is offered on DSPs. For example  in the U. S.  according to Luminate's 2024 midyear report  the top 10 physical albums of 2024 carried as many as 13 physical product variants. Of those top 10 albums  8 were by UMG artists  of whom had fan stores operated by UMG's direct-to-consumer division. This important strategy to us enables us not only to offer Superfans's high-quality products at varying price points  but also to accelerate our initiatives through efforts such as our recently announced partnerships with Network and Complex to build our direct-to-fan relationships  providing a powerful commercial opportunity for us and our artists. Putting our artist’s front and center in everything that we do has been and always will be the core of our success  and this year is no exception. We not only represent the most successful artists in the world and consistently break new artists  we also have the expertise  talent and resources to support artists throughout their careers. It's no secret that UMG has the most popular catalog in the world  for good reason. Every day our artists are creating what will be the most listened to  recorded and music publishing catalogs of the future. I'd like to tell you about some of our artists' extraordinary successes so far this year. This part  as you know  always gives me great pleasure and joy. It demonstrates that UMG is once again responsible for the industry's biggest global artist development stories. I'll have more to say about artists such as Sabrina Carpenter  Chappell Roan  Noah Kahan and Gracie Abrams in just a moment  but what's particularly gratifying is that  these artist development successes follow the strategic realignment of our recent U.S. label structure. Through these processes  we are achieving significant efficiencies  even more importantly through this process. We are essentially drafting the blueprints for the labels of the future. These labels will provide aspiring global superstars  with even more powerful and effective support for their talents. For example  let's start with Sabrina. The UMG recording artist and songwriter  who is also assigned to our Music Publishing division. This year  Sabrina exploded. She became the first artist to top the Billboard Global 200 and Global X U.S. charts simultaneously with two songs  Espresso and Please Please Please. These tracks also hit number 1 and number 2 on the UK chart  respectively. Please Please Please became her first number one in the U. S. on the Billboard Hot 100 by opening for Taylor Swift during Taylor's tour in Latin America  Asian and Australia  Sabrina massively built on our international profile. All of this helped set up her new album  Short n' Sweet  which is coming out next month. In brief  we could not possibly be more excited and proud about the amazing career ahead for Sabrina. Then there's Chappell Roan. Chappell released a couple of singles independently before choosing to sign with Ireland Records under the labels recently appointed CEOs  [Justin Ishak] and [Imraad Majeed]. Her debut album  The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess  which I urge you to listen to if you haven't  was released in 2023 to major critical acclaim. The buzz continued as she opened for Interscope artist Olivia Rodrigo for several months of her tour. The album climbed up the Billboard 200  reaching number 5 by mid-July. The exceptional first Single - Good Luck  Babe! is in the top 10 of Billboards chart and is steadily growing across Australia  Canada and all of Europe  where she sold out -- completely sold out a tour this fall. Next  Noah Kahan is another brilliant artist for whom we've helped to build a huge following. With years of consistent work and fan building around the world  he's now achieved platinum sales of stick season in more than 15 countries throughout North America  Asia  Africa and again  the whole of Europe. Or how about Gracie Abrams? After signing to Interscope in 2019  yes  that's five years ago when she was 20  Gracie is also signed to us for Music Publishing  released her first EP in 2020  followed by a second in 2021. She then toured the U. S  Australia and Europe before opening on Olivia Rodrigo's first tour  and then she also opened for a number of the Taylor Swift U. S. Tour dates. After being nominated as best new artist at this year's Grammy Awards  her second album  The Secret of Us  was released last month with incredible chart debuts  including number one in the UK  Australia and the Netherlands  number two in the U.S. And in the top five in Germany  Canada  Ireland  Belgium  New Zealand as well as Switzerland. A long-term phenomenal artist development  belief  success  teamwork  global teamwork. We're  of course  justifiably proud of all that we do to help new artists like these breakthrough  and then go on to develop long lasting careers. But we're equally proud of the support we're able to give established artists. Ones we've been working with for years to help them reach new milestones in their careers. I'll give you a few examples of just how super some of the superstars have been doing this year. First  of course  is Taylor. What can I say  a phenomenon  unique  extraordinary. Her latest album  The Tortured Poets Department  achieved the biggest album debut of her career. It was her 14th number one and broke records for the highest number of first week streams for an album in history  not a single  not a song  not a track  an album. Internationally  the album hit number one in 19 countries around the world  and on Spotify  it became the fastest album ever to surpass 1 billion global streams. Next  Billie  Billie Eilish. A new album  Hit Me Hard and Soft  gave Billie her best sales week ever in the U. S. as well as her best ever vinyl sales week. The album amassed over 500 million global streams that first week and has reached number one in the official charts of 25 countries  and we're still counting. With over 65 million followers  Billie is now the most followed solo artist on TikTok. She too will start a global tour this fall. And again  if you can go and see her  I would. We're also thrilled about recent releases from Post Malone and Eminem. Post Malone's collaboration with Taylor Swift on the massive single  Fortnight  propelled him back to the top of the charts. That was followed by I Had Some Help featuring Morgan Wallen  which spent 7 weeks at number one on the Hot 100 and became the longest running number one of 2024. And then came his single  Pour Me A Drink  which features Blake Shelton. Post Malone's sixth studio album  F-1 Trillion  will be out in August  and we've inevitably got very  very high hopes for it. Eminem’s The Death of Slim Shady is already a massive hit. The first single  Houdini  debuted at number one as well as throughout all of the Global X U.S. charts. In short  if you take a quick look at the charts around the world  for the first half of this year  you get a real sense of how truly spectacularly well our artists are doing. Let me talk about the three largest music markets  the U.S  Japan and the UK. In the U.S.  we had 11 out of the top 15 albums in the first half  including all of the top three  albums from Taylor Swift  Morgan Wallen  and Noah Kahan. Off the 15 different songs to hit number 1 on the Billboard 100 so far this year  Universal Music Publishing Group had songwriters on 13 of them  an extraordinary achievement. In Japan  we had three of the top five artists with Mrs. Green Apple (NASDAQ: ) at number 1 as well as Back Number and Ado. We also had six of the top 10 albums. Additionally  A Group was the top selling new artist. Don't forget that Japan is the second biggest market in the world by value. These successes are very  very significant. In the UK  we had eight of the top 10 albums  including those from Noah Kahan  Olivia Rodrigo  Ariana Grande and Billie Eilish and four from Taylor. UMG office held the number one spot for 18 weeks of the first half of the year. I'll now turn to the final subject of my remarks for today  our recent initiatives in AI. I'm sure you can understand that given the enormous value of our artists' drive in the market and with their increasingly significant cultural impact. Protecting their rights and advancing their interests is absolutely essential  essential to them  essential to us. This is especially true when it comes to AI  an area in which we take a carefully orchestrated approach  we call  carrots-and-sticks. We recognize potential threats early and defend against them. We've been doing this for quite a long time. I suppose it's akin to carrying a stick  when we consistently take industry-leading action to advance our artist interests and create new creative and commercial opportunities  and then his response to the carrot. Our carrot-and-sticks mindset is working to secure a future in which human creativity is respected and rewarded while technology innovation is enabled and accelerated. It's a two part strategy. We accomplished these goals through a wide variety of tactics. For example  in May  we entered into an agreement with TikTok that had several successful outcomes  including both creative and protective provisions. These protections didn't just benefit UMG and its artists  it benefited the entire music sector. Likewise  the major music companies recently filed copyright infringement cases against two AI music generation services  Suno and Udio. These cases are based on the mass infringement of copyrighted sound recordings  which have been copied and exploited without anyone's permission  no one's permission. And these cases follow the lawsuit filed late last year against Anthropic by several music publishers  including Universal Music Publishing Group. Those categories fall into the category of ensuring the continued value of our rights. What we're even more excited about are the opportunities to harness responsibly developed and deployed AI. These opportunities are where AI can help drive our business. UMG has long recognized and embraced the potential of AI to enhance and amplify human creativity and to advance musical innovation and to expand the realms of audio production as well as sound technology with responsible and ethical applications that respect copyright and intellectual property. I suppose it's what we -- as a management team  we call  as everybody gets used to soccer analogies  defense and offense  attack and defense. To that end  we've been working with agronomist of partners to provide our artists with its cutting edge creative tools  but in a way that respects continues to respect their rights. For example  we recently announced an exciting partnership with SoundLabs the company that places powerful mutual at an artist fingertips while maintaining a deep respect for the artists and intellectual property. The company's ethos mirrors our own strategy of employing AI technology in the service of artistry. Our partnership will enable UMG's artists and producers to use SoundLab's MicDrop. MicDrop is a cutting-edge AI vocal plug in that generates ultrahigh fidelity vocal models for artists using an artist's own voice data for AI training to enable creative utilization by the artists themselves. They'll be able to sing in languages they don't speak  restore imperfect vocal recordings  and more. The ability to be able to sing in their own voices in languages that they don't speak opens up enormous potential and enormous opportunity for us to sell market  move culture and create demand for songs and products and back catalog that would have been completely unimaginable  very exciting. In addition  UMG recently joined with Roland  the leading electronic music instrument maker  to publish the principles for music creation with AI. The principles are a series of clarifying statements relating to the responsible use of it in music creation and advocating for their adoption across the creative community. They highlight the opportunity for innovation with AI in music production  fascinatingly for me composition and songwriting whilst underscoring the need for transparency  equity and creative community involvement in the AI development. More than 60 prominent music companies  associations and institutions globally have now added their support to these principles  whose goal is both simple and profound  to protect the very essence of music  that is  the expression of the human spirit by human  not artificial intelligence  of its authenticity  brilliance and genuineness. With so much positive change of foot in the industry  we look forward to sharing a much deeper and broader view of both the industry and our strategy at our upcoming Capital Markets Day  which will be held in London on September 17 at our Legendary Abbey Road Studios. We love that building  we love owning it. And we're really looking forward to being there and talking about our company and sharing what we believe in and our long-term ambitions  hopes. Information on how to register for the live stream will be available shortly on the Investor Relations section  apparently on our website. We look forward to giving you the opportunity to hear from members of our management team  exactly what we're doing and we're looking forward to sharing with you  as I said  our vision for the future of UMG and the industry as well as for the enormous potential of growth that we're so confident in and what we see for the future. With that  I can see you  Boyd  I'd like to hand over to you. Go for it.Boyd Muir: Thanks  Lucian. The second quarter shows once again that  the diversity of our revenue composition supports our conviction about our ability to deliver consistent high single-digit revenue growth. As Lucian mentioned  we have delivered or indeed exceeded  that growth level in all 12 quarters since our public listing. There will always be variability quarter-to-quarter  so we continue to encourage you to view the business over a longer time horizon. Internally  we do not manage the business on a quarterly basis and are  therefore  not overly concerned  when we see variation in our quarterly results. We have a diversified business model which accommodates quarterly variations  while still delivering solid growth at the group level. When we host our Capital Markets Day  we look forward to providing you with a more detailed update on our strategic plan and expectations for the company over the mid-term. But for now  let me walk you through our results this quarter. Even with streaming and subscription growth slower-than-expected  which I will get to momentarily  revenue grew by 10% and adjusted EBITDA grew by 11% in constant currency  driving 20 basis points of adjusted EBITDA margin expansion to 22.1%. While margin benefited from operating leverage and some initial cost savings related to our strategic organizational redesign  the margin expansion was constrained by the greater proportion of lower margin physical and merchandising sales  which I'll come to when we look at the performance by business segment. In terms of the difference between EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA  we had EUR69 million in non-cash  share-based compensation expense for the quarter compared to EUR85 million in the prior year quarter. For the half year  revenue was up 9% and adjusted EBITDA grew 13%  driving margin expansion of 0.8 percentage points to 22.4%. Total adjusted EBITDA margin reflects strong 1.2 percentage point margin expansion in recorded music  partially offset by margin contraction in music publishing and in merchandising. The first half of the year had a total of EUR171 million in non-cash  share-based compensation expense  which includes EUR80 million for the final impact of onetime transition grants and front loaded accounting recognition. The EUR170 million compares to EUR345 million in expense during the first half of 2023. We currently expect about EUR280 million in non-cash share based compensation expense this year. Earnings per share for the first half of 2024 grew to EUR0.50 up from EUR0.34 and adjusted earnings per share grew to EUR0.44 up from EUR0.42 in the first half of 2023. Recorded music revenue grew 7% for the quarter and 6% for the half year. This revenue growth drove adjusted EBITDA up 12% for the first half and adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 1.2 percentage points to 25.4% for the half year. The margin expansion is largely the result of operating leverage but was also helped by modest incremental cash compensation savings associated with our equity plan rollout and the start of initial cost savings associated with Phase 1 of our strategic organizational redesign program  which we discussed last quarter. Looking at recorded music  subscription revenue saw a deceleration in growth  up by 7% this quarter. It's worth noting that our comp against 2023 was 3 points more difficult in Q2 than it was in Q1 partially due to the timing of price increases. The other factor impacting our subscription revenue growth this quarter is the slowdown in subscriber growth at certain platforms  which is occurring while the overall subscription marketplace continues to experience significant growth in subscribers globally. While Spotify  YouTube and many regional and local platforms have continued to exhibit healthy growth in subscribers  other large partners who have been less successful in driving global adoption have seen a slowdown in new subscriber additions. We are engaged with all our key partners in an in-depth dialogue regarding product innovation to target high value customers and drive future revenue growth. One indication of these discussions was highlighted in Spotify's comments yesterday around the super-premium offering. Our research and analysis indicate that as many as 20% of the current subscriber base could upgrade to a super-premium tier at a meaningfully higher price point for a compelling product configuration  one which offers enhanced features and exclusive access to content. In addition  we're stepping up our artist centric initiatives to combat fraud and together with the platforms  improve the user experience with a focus on premium and innovative new products. We take a long-term view in our efforts to promote innovation in the product portfolios offered by our digital service partners with our industry leading roster and catalog at the center of these offerings. We see this as key to deepening the artist-fan relationship and growing the industry. Together  we are confident that  we'll see healthy growth across our portfolio of platform partnerships  and we look forward to discussing this progress in more detail at our upcoming Capital Markets Day on September 17th. Moving on to the ad-supported business. Ad-supported streaming revenue declined 4% in the quarter. As we cautioned last quarter  when our ad-supported performance was significantly better  we need to see broad-based improvement across multiple partners and geographies over a longer timeframe before we're ready to adopt a less cautious view. Our ad-supported revenue comp against 2023 was seven points more difficult in Q2 than it was in Q1. In addition  this quarter's ad revenue reflects a blend of platform-specific and continued macro pressures. In terms of platform specific pressure  we have a change in our licensing agreement with Meta. Meta had previously offered premium music videos on Facebook (NASDAQ: ). This product offering was less popular with Facebook's user base than other music products and as a result  Meta is no longer licensing premium music videos from us as of May this year. Meta is now focusing instead on other areas  involving music content and we are working together to expand these areas as part of a multifaceted renewal. Excluding this impact as well as the lost months of TikTok revenue in the quarter  while we were out of license with them  ad supported streaming revenue grew year-over-year. The remainder of the slowdown in growth compared to first quarter was largely driven by slowdowns in ad revenue growth at Spotify and YouTube as they both reported yesterday. While the coming quarters may remain somewhat variable  we and our partners are laser focused on improving the monetization for the growing audience engagement on the platforms. Over a longer time horizon as we continue to see the secular migration of the ad economy to digital formats  and as the opportunities for music content monetization continue to broaden into new avenues like gaming and health and wellness  we remain confident in the growth of our digital revenue. Moving now to physical. Physical revenue grew 14% in the second quarter with strong releases from Taylor Swift and Billie Eilish more than offsetting a difficult comp against a strong prior year quarter in Japan. While this category will necessarily be more release driven and therefore more volatile quarter-to-quarter  the growth we are seeing in physical revenue also reflects the emerging opportunity around Super Fandom as a significant portion of sales reflect demand for physical products as collectibles rather than for consumption purposes and as we fulfill more of these sales directly through our own D2C capabilities. Licensing and other revenue grew 18% in the quarter  driven by improvements in licensing and synchronization income as well as higher direct-to-consumer income and greater live and audiovisual revenues. In the first half of the year  Latin America saw the strongest growth and North America and Europe benefited from the strength in vinyl. Revenue in Asia declined solely as a result of the difficult physical comp in Japan against last year's enormous success of King & Prince. Top sellers for the first half of 2024 include Taylor Swift  Morgan Wallen  Noah Kahn  Billie Eilish and Ariana Grande. Turning now to Music Publishing. Revenue grew 10% in the quarter with strong 17% growth in digital revenue driven by continued global growth in streaming and subscription. We also saw growth in performance and synchronization revenue while mechanical revenue declined as a result of the broader industry shift to digital formats. For the half year  music publishing revenue grew 14% and music publishing adjusted EBITDA grew 12% as margin declined 0.4 percentage points as a result of revenue and repertoire mix. Turning now to merchandising. Merchandising revenue grew 44% in the quarter  driven by growth in both direct-to-consumer and in touring sales. Merchandising revenue grew 30% for the half year  but adjusted EBITDA declined 10% and margin contracted 2.3 percentage points due primarily to artist mix. Touring merch grew strongly thanks to tourists from Olivia Rodrigo  The Rolling Stones  Nicki Minaj  21 Savage  and Morgan Wallen. Net profit for the first half of 2024 amounted to EUR914 million compared to EUR625 million in the first half of 2023  resulting in earnings per share of EUR0.50 compared to EUR0.34 in the first half of 2023. The increase in net profit in the first half of 2024 includes a EUR566 million increase in the valuation of investments in listed companies compared to an increase of EUR313 million in the first half of 2023. This was partially offset by restructuring costs of EUR113 million in the first half of 2024  as we began the implementation of our strategic organizational design. Net profit also reflects the EUR171 million equity plan expense in the first half of 2024 compared to EUR345 million in the first half of 2023. Adjusted net profit  which adjusts for the revaluation of investments as well as the equity expense and restructuring costs  amongst other items  grew 6% to EUR809 million in the first half of 2024  resulting in adjusted earnings per share of EUR0.44 compared to EUR0.42 in the first half of 2023. In line with our commitment to pay a dividend of at least 50% of our net profits  the interim dividend for 2024 will be EUR439 million or EUR0.24 per share. I'd like to now turn to cash flow. Our net cash provided by operating activities  before income taxes paid for the first half of 2024 was EUR436 million  a 38% decline year-over-year. This decline is driven by an increase in net royalty advance payments  which amounted to EUR315 million  up from EUR95 million in the first half of 2023 due to the timing of certain major artist deal renewals and extensions  partly offset by an increase in recruitment. While sometimes major artists approach us to extend deals early  we currently expect royalty advances to step down materially in the back half of the year. In addition  net cash provided by operating activities was negatively impacted by the EUR67 million in cash restructuring related to the organizational redesign in the first half of 2024. Similar to last year  net cash provided by operating activities also included the EUR194 million  we paid to settle employee tax liabilities arising from equity plan grants and associated obligations. You'll recall that  we opted to fund the taxes with cash  rather than issue shares  which reduces the dilutive impact of the grants. Even with the increase in royalty advances and the taxes paid to cover employee tax obligations  free cash flow before investing activities was a positive EUR155 million in the first half of 2024. Let me remind you  the second half of the year is a consistently stronger cash-generating period for our business. We also continued our long-term strategic investment in the business  much of which we have discussed on prior earnings calls. On our fourth quarter 2023 earnings call  we noted that  the acquisition of Mavin Records  the investment in Complex Network and the investment in Chord would collectively represent approximately EUR450 million of investment spending in the first half of 2024. These transactions account for much of the EUR519 million invested in the first half of the year. On last year's first half earnings call  we noted that  we had a EUR75 million cash in escrow for a catalog acquisition  which we transfer out of other investment activities and into catalog investment in 2024. This transfer occurred in the first half of 2024  which accounted for much of the EUR96 million in catalog acquisitions. While free cash flow in the first half was an outflow of EUR460 million  we encourage you to look at cash generation on a full year basis  rather than for a half year  as working capital movements and the timing of investments can vary considerably during a shorter timeframe. Let me close by saying that  we remain excited by and confident in the growth that lies ahead for the business. Music has never been more vital to an ever increasing number of partners and UMG is best positioned to capitalize on these industry prospects. We look forward to updating you on our outlook for the business at our Capital Markets Day on September 17. And with that  Lucian  Michael Nash and I will now take your questions. So operator  please open the line for Q&A.Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question goes to Adrien de Saint Hilaire of Bank of America Merrill Lynch (NYSE: ).Adrien de Saint Hilaire: Yeah. Thank you very much. So a couple of questions  please. On the paid streaming side of things. First  could you tell us like you alluded  Boyd  to the growth of Spotify and YouTube? Would your growth rate with Spotify  for example  would that be somewhat identical to the number that they've reported? That would be the first question. And secondly  all the initiatives that you've talked about working with partners to get them to reengage on subscriber growth  et cetera  I would imagine that this is going to take probably a couple of quarters. So is it fair to assume that from here  paid streaming growth further decelerates into the second half?Boyd Muir: Adrian  thank you. I mean  broadly speaking  I would say that our growth rates are consistent with our view. Our Spotify growth rates are consistent or broadly consistent with what Spotify reported yesterday. And I think you're right. What we're doing with partners in terms of product innovation  it does take time. It's a kind of you can see it as a continuous progression anyway. So it will take a little bit of time  but we would be hopeful to see some of these initiatives happening towards the end of this year so you can see something quite tangible.Operator: The next question goes to Adam Berlin of UBS.Adam Berlin: Yeah. Hi  good evening. Two questions again on paid streaming. The first question is  what's your estimate for how fast you think the market is growing paid subscribers at the moment? Obviously  there seems to be some deceleration since Q1  but do you have a market view from all the platforms you work with? And related to that  do you expect that growth rate to improve? Or are we just going to have to operate in an environment with slower subscriber growth from that one? That's the first question. Sorry for the two parts. And the second question is  can you comment on Spotify's new audiobooks tier? The way they seem to enact that was to kind of raise everyone's price and then only later introduce the option to trade down to a basic tier. In your view  is that fundamentally just a price increase and you should get the same pay away as you would do for any other price increase? Or do you accept their argument that this is a different kind of bundle and that  therefore  you should be paid less for that extra dollar?Michael Nash: Adam  thank you for your questions. Michael Nash here. Let me first address the question about growth outlook. Let me hit a couple of data points to put our perspective in context. The IFPI  which is the Global Trade Organization in the music industry  their global report that was released earlier this year indicated that the industry hit about 670 million subscribers last year. That reflected an increase over 2022 of 78 million subscribers and that exceeded the prior year increase of 66 million subscribers as growth actually accelerated in 2023. Both U.S. and UK markets reported higher subscription revenue growth rates in 2023 than 2022  so some acceleration there. Media reported that 5 of the top 10 global subscriber markets added more subscribers in 2023 than 2022. We're seeing sustained or accelerated subscription growth across multiple markets. In terms of expansion and the addressable market  our consumer research assesses the scale of the consideration set in the top 19 territories. We've identified an addressable market of over 180 million consumers that will form the next wave of subscription adoption and that research was conducted  assuming price increases. About half of that total addressable market will be in the 13 developed market and we expect to see a lot of growth in emerging markets. It's important to keep in mind that technology innovation  digital infrastructure penetration  emerging consumer trends  all these things have been consistently growing the total addressable market for subscription over the last decade. Forecast of TAM is not a ceiling for growth  but it's really about the scope of the next wave of growth. Very interesting recent data point  the Luminate Midyear 2024 Report indexes global on-demand streaming growth at over 15% and the majority of that is premium paid. We remain confident about the overall growth trajectory of the marketplace. I think it's important again to keep in mind that  the perspective about the evolution of the market is something that doesn't necessarily on a quarter by quarter basis always track linearly  but we are confident about the overall trajectory of the market viewed in the longer-term.Boyd Muir: Thanks  Michael. Adam  just turning to your second question  which was specifically about Spotify and the audiobook bundle. What I would need to say is that  we don't actually disclose the terms of our agreements with any partners. But let me say that  we always negotiate licensing models and terms to ensure that  we fully and fairly participate in the value our content brings to all product configurations  including bundled products. We've been deeply engaged with Spotify in discussions about the overall scope of their product portfolio roadmap  and we're confident our revenue participation reflects the value our artists and our music is bringing to their platform. The only other point that I would make is that  we take a long-term view in all of these efforts to promote innovation  and we see the evolution of product portfolios offered by our digital service partners. With our industry-leading roster and catalog right at the center  we see that product innovation  as key to deepening the artist-fan relationship and expanding the future.Lucian Grainge: I'd like to add there that  we are at the beginning of the next phase  Part 2 phase of streaming and subscription. It's a whole suite of products  the Superfan  the technology developments  as we discussed earlier in AI and what that will allow both of us. All the platforms and the DSPs to innovate products  the genres  the regions  the local cultures  the scenes  the ability to use AI to convert or allow our artists to sing their own music in different languages. We like it when we're able to encourage our partners into win-win positions where we can experiment. We're in a cycle of experimentation. And that's again one of the reasons why we can't do -- it's in our blood. We can't do anything than think in multiyear cycles and in the long-term. And whilst quarterly earnings is a great temperature check  and it allows us to actually reflect on what we're doing and so on and so on. The long-term strategy in terms of how we are working to provide more Superfans  more access  more engagement and that the critical nature of the product of what we do. We just reel these names off  Rolling Stones  Beatles  Sabrina Carpenter  Chappell Roan  Noah Kahan  Taylor Swift. They're absolutely fundamental. They're the protein in everything that we do. Our entire mentality is to grow the pie.Operator: And the next question goes to Omar Mejias of Wells Fargo.Omar Mejias: Thank you for taking my question. Maybe as a follow-up to the prior question regarding recorded music subscription growth. Are you guys seeing a structural slowdown globally on subscriber additions? Or is this  location specific? And are there any other factors at play with the slowdown of some of these large DSPs? And my second question  just and I appreciate  Michael  some of the higher level trends on just the growth that you guys are seeing and the outlook for streaming growth. But just  we are seeing continued subscription streaming  both volume growth decelerating to 3Q. So just curious  how should we think about growth in the back half of this year  and just some of the trends that you guys are seeing given some of the issues?Michael Nash: Thank you for your questions  Omar. So let me double-click  as you've asked us to do in terms of following up on some of the points that we've made. In general  just keep in mind  subscription revenue growth  it's a reflection of subscriber growth  pricing  our market share streams  and that's across a really broad range of global regional streaming partners  vastly different growth dynamics in ARPUs. So at the high level  you're seeing the topsoil and the root structure or everything gets growing on top of the soil  much more complex interplay. And forgive me if that was like a weak horticultural analogy there. A couple of things to keep in mind  because you've asked me to look really specifically at what's happening right now. As Boyd noted  our comp against 2023  in the second quarter was three points more difficult than it was in the first quarter. That's largely due to the timing of pricing increases. In the second quarter of this year  we fully annualized the Apple and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) price increases. So when you're looking at variations of a few points  there's a lot of things that potentially build into that. In this case  the comp difference of three points is something to keep in mind. The remainder of the deceleration to emphasize what Boyd articulated largely due to subscriber growth at certain platforms. Spotify and YouTube public statements make it very clear they continue to exhibit healthy growth in subscribers and there's been some significant growth with the regional and local players. Other larger partners have been less successful at driving global adoption and there's been some slowdown in terms of subscriber additions there. One point of analysis that you might find interesting from our consumer research  it's not that  there's an increase in switching  it's really more about the competition for new subscribers. The services that are growing faster  doing a better job of enlisting new subscribers. I think with respect to what we expect to do in reigniting growth  we've been in very deep dialogue with our partners about product and platform innovation. There are a lot of opportunities to do that. We are particularly excited about the prospects of a super-premium tier. Daniel Ek on the Spotify earnings call yesterday  talked about what they saw as significant potential there and hinted at some of their plans and confirmed that  they do intend to launch a super-premium tier. That's one example of the kind of product innovation effort that could result in acceleration of growth. Hopefully that gives you a little bit more of a particularized view of what we're seeing in the near-term that maps against the broader perspective that I articulated earlier.Lucian Grainge: I think you're hearing  Omar  I think you're hearing  a repeating theme  product development in terms of our attitude and our view with regard to what those products could and should look like  same obviously with our DSP partners  the degree of experimentation  customer fan feedback  more access  more engagement  and the fact that different partners are focusing on different aspects of their business according to what they see with their audiences and with their consumers. The amount of work  win-win dialogue  creative discussions that are going on between us is really extremely exciting. Some of these things in some of the platforms between operating systems and engineers and multitude of things can occasionally take time to implement. We're on that implementation now.Operator: The next question goes to William Packer of BNP Paribas (OTC: ).William Packer: Hi there. Many thanks for taking my questions. Firstly  within the  ad streaming  there's a lot of noise with the TikTok spats  changes to the Meta deal  et cetera. Could you help us think through the exit rate in ad streaming once the TikTok deal has been resigned? And then secondly  just coming back on the subscription streaming trends  could you confirm  for example  mix of price and volume and any factors that should specifically drive an acceleration in Q3. I know we've kind of covered some of the longer term potential factors. But if we take the Spotify  UK and U. S. price increases  could that help or does the bundling mean that that won't be a contributor? Thank you.Michael Nash: Thank you for your questions  William. First of all  with respect to putting the TikTok revenue piece into context. Boyd talked about Meta switching away from premium music videos in the past quarter. The focus there is on higher growth products and formats moving forward. If you take that piece and the fact that we missed one month of TikTok revenue in the quarter  excluding those impacts  ad supported stream revenue actually grew for us in the second quarter. So I hope that that gives you some perspective about the dynamics within the quarter  and where ad streaming would net out taking those into consideration. And then on your second question  what I'm getting and unpacking the question is how are we seeing growth with respect to price and subscriber growth and those dynamics. We still see subscriber growth as fundamentally most important in terms of growing subscription revenues. We have talked before about how powerful the value proposition of subscription streaming is relative to other forms of digital entertainment  video and gaming  underpriced perhaps to be extended by 20% of the cost per hour of entertainment of other formats. And we repeatedly hear  including on Spotify's earnings call yesterday  service is talking about price increases and not experiencing any churn. So we see a lot of opportunity there. More importantly for us is how we see innovation with new product potentially driving the opportunity. And there was  in the comments that Spotify made  the suggestion of a price point perhaps at 17 or 18 for a new product configuration  which wasn't fully articulated  but that's giving you some sense of what might be possible. And as we have previously articulated and on this call have talked about  maybe a target of 20% of the subscriber base that's potentially  the opportunity for adoption of higher priced tier among existing subscribers. So that's how we're looking at the formulation of the equation of growth made up of those multiple components.Lucian Grainge: I'd just like to add one last thing. You mentioned TikTok. The value which won't appear in a percentage today  the value in the new TikTok deal  the new arrangement with them is in the protections  is in the value of us working with them on responsible AI  on e-commerce and the value in having a new spirit of partnership with them and the dialogue and the zeitgeist that  that gives in terms of the entire spirit of how we work and how we are as an organization and as a culture for us as well as our artists.Operator: And the final question goes to Julien Roch of Barclays.Julien Roch: Yes. Good evening. Thank you  for letting me ask a question. The first one is for well  actually  probably the two for Boyd. EUR315 million in terms of net content investment in the first half versus EUR95 million last year. You say it would step down materially in the second half  but is it stepping down from the EUR315 million  so the total for the full year will be above EUR315 million? Or is it going negative and the full year number will be lower than EUR315 million if we could get some form of guidance there? That's my first question. In the last 12-months  you bought more companies than usual. You bought in H2 last year and then you spent EUR450 million in the first half this year. Could we get the constant FX contribution in first half revenue of all the M&A you've done in the last 12-months  please?Boyd Muir: Julian  thank you. Not in a position to give guidance with regard to the content investment. Clearly  the EUR300 million plus in the first half of the year was an elevated level. As you pointed out  it's not overly difficult to come down from that very elevated number. We refer to the prior half  which was EUR95 million. There's quite a significant swing half-by-half  quarter-to-quarter. If it's helpful  we can probably say now that with the course of time over the last few years is  that it seems to be over the last three years  we seem to be in a range of the kind of EUR150 million to EUR250 million of net advance investment kind of year-over-year. I wouldn't envisage that we would be negative in the second half of the year  but I don't want go into it much more than  I already have done.Lucian Grainge: There are also investments for the future. We're building a marketplace with network and complex. And our emerging market strategy  our export strategy within them. Everything is future focused.Boyd Muir: Julian  just the second part of your question  which was about the investments that we've made in Chord and Mavin and in Complex Network. At this point in time  these are investments with a long time horizon. There's nothing meaningful in terms of our financials so far. There are topics that will be on the agenda for Capital Markets Day.Operator: Thank you. That's all the questions that we have time for today. This now concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

This move is seen as a positive sign for the City’s financial market  which has shown signs of revival in recent ...,French conglomerate VIVENDI has announced its plans to spin off and list its television business  CANAL+  on the London Stock Exchange. This move is seen as a positive sign for the City’s financial market  which has shown signs of revival in recent months.In a statement today  the Paris-based media company explained its decision to list CANAL+ in London  highlighting the international reach of the business. With nearly two-thirds of its subscribers based outside of France and a global distribution network for films and TV series  CANAL+ is strategically positioning itself to attract international investors.“A London-based listing would represent an attractive solution for international investors likely to be interested in the group ” VIVENDI stated  citing recent growth in African  European  and Asia-Pacific markets.Corporate Structure and TaxationDespite the London listing  the spun-off television business will be incorporated and taxed in France. It will not be subject to mandatory stock market regulations in either the United Kingdom or France. Additionally  VIVENDI mentioned the possibility of a secondary listing of CANAL+ shares in Johannesburg.The decision to spin off CANAL+ is part of a broader restructuring effort by VIVENDI to address what it describes as a “conglomerate discount ” where investors have undervalued the company as a whole. As part of this restructuring:HAVAS   VIVENDI’s public relations firm  will be spun off and listed as a Dutch public limited liability company on Euronext in Amsterdam.  VIVENDI’s public relations firm  will be spun off and listed as a Dutch public limited liability company on Euronext in Amsterdam.

VIVENDI’s listed subsidiary LAGARDÈRE will continue to be listed on the main market of Euronext Paris.Implications for the London Stock ExchangeThe listing of CANAL+ on the London Stock Exchange is expected to provide a much-needed boost to the market  which has experienced a lull in new listings. In the first half of 2024  only eight new companies went public on the London Stock Exchange  raising a total of £513.8 million.However  there are signs of renewed activity. In June  British computer firm RASPBERRY PI made its market debut  raising around £30 million at a valuation of approximately £540 million. Additionally  fast-fashion giant SHEIN is reportedly preparing for a public offering in the near future.FCA Reforms and Market OutlookThe Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has implemented the most significant overhaul of IPO regulations in three decades  aiming to attract more companies to list on the market. These changes are set to take effect at the end of this month  potentially increasing IPO activity in the latter half of the year.City analysts have expressed optimism about the prospects for the London stock market. “The London stock market is steadily gaining momentum after a challenging two years stifled by macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainty ” said Scott McCubbin  head of EY’s UK IPO business  last month.

Photograph: Sean Gallup/Getty ImagesRyanair had settled in nicely as the top dog on the Iseq in Dublin this year after the exits of former index heavyweights CRH and Flutter Entertainment from the Irish market.The group had even briefly breached the €21 a share price level in April – which if sustained for 28 days on the trot would secure a €100 million stock bonus for its chief executive of three decades Michael O’Leary.However  Ryanair’s share price slumped earlier this week – with the carrier losing 17 per cent of its value on Monday alone after first-quarter profits missed estimates and the outlook spooked investors. That saw it knocked off the top spot on Tuesday briefly by Kingspan.Kingspan ended that session with a market value of close to €15.5 billion  eclipsing Ryanair’s €15.3 billion market cap as the budget airline’s shares hit a 52-week closing low of €13.62.READ MORERyanair’s comments that its fares had plunged 15 per cent in the three months through June and were expected to be “materially lower” for the remainder of the summer – and that this was being experienced across the industry as consumers were under pressure – caught investors off guard.They were even more baffled when two days later rival EasyJet said its fares the June quarter had only dipped 1 per cent and that it expects this trend to continue through the summer.“A difference of this magnitude between Europe’s two largest point to point airlines is surprising. The networks are not identical  but Ryanair is a major player in most of Easyjet’s main markets ” said Alex Irving  an analyst with Bernstein in a note to clients on Friday. “Ultimately we see fare trends between the two as likely to converge.”While analysts took red pens to their earnings forecasts and price targets for Ryanair’s stock  the average new goal points to 27 per cent upside from current levels and a market value for the group of €20.4 billion in the next 12 months. It closed on Friday at €16.9 billion.Kingspan  which has advanced 16 per cent over past year  only has about 6.5 per cent upside from here  according to the average price objective – pointing to a market cap of €16.2 billion  compared to €15.2 billion  currently.,neutral,0.1,0.8,0.1,mixed,0.23,0.2,0.57,True,English,"['top dog', 'Kingspan', 'Ryanair', 'Iseq', '€21 a share price level', 'former index heavyweights', 'Michael O’Leary', '52-week closing low', 'average new goal', 'average price objective', 'two largest point', '€100 million stock bonus', '€15.3 billion market cap', 'price targets', 'point airlines', 'Irish market', 'Investor reaction', 'poor set', 'top spot', 'Sean Gallup', 'Getty Images', 'top dog', 'Flutter Entertainment', 'chief executive', 'three decades', 'first-quarter profits', 'budget airline', 'three months', 'major player', 'main markets', 'Alex Irving', 'fare trends', 'red pens', 'earnings forecasts', 'current levels', 'next 12 months', 'past year', 'market value', '17 per cent', 'June quarter', '1 per', 'results', 'Ryanair', 'Dublin', 'Euronext', 'terms', 'Photograph', 'Iseq', 'exits', 'CRH', 'group', 'April', '28 days', 'trot', 'carrier', 'Monday', 'estimates', 'outlook', 'investors', 'Tuesday', 'Kingspan', 'session', 'shares', 'READ', 'comments', 'fares', 'remainder', 'summer', 'industry', 'consumers', 'pressure', 'guard', 'rival', 'EasyJet', 'difference', 'magnitude', 'Europe', 'networks', 'analyst', 'Bernstein', 'note', 'clients', 'Friday', '27']",2024-07-27,2024-07-27,irishtimes.com

Recent strategic expansions into Germany's wealth management sector could influence future financial stability and asset management growth  potentially impacting dividend sustainability.

Additionally  while the stock trades below estimated fair value  earnings are expected to decline over the next three years  posing risks to ongoing dividend reliability and growth.Story continuesENXTAM:ABN Dividend History as at Jul 2024Simply Wall St Dividend Rating: ★★★★☆☆Overview: Koninklijke Heijmans N.V. is a company based in the Netherlands that operates in property development  construction  and infrastructure sectors  with a market capitalization of approximately €631.75 million.Operations: Koninklijke Heijmans N.V. generates revenue through its Real Estate segment (€411.79 million)  Van Wanrooij division (€124.76 million)  Infrastructure Works (€800.03 million)  and Construction & Technology sector (€1.08 billion).Dividend Yield: 3.8%Koninklijke Heijmans exhibits a mixed dividend profile.
