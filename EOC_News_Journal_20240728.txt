Following the start of Russia's military operation in Ukraine  the EU and G7 countries froze nearly half of Russia's foreign exchange reserves  amounting to approximately â‚¬300 billion.Over â‚¬200 billion are held in the EU  mainly by Belgium's Euroclear  one of the world's largest settlement and clearing systems. The Russian Foreign Ministry has described the freezing of assets in Europe as theft  noting that the EU is targeting not only private funds but also Russian state assets.Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated that Russia would respond if frozen Russian assets in the West were confiscated. He mentioned that Russia also has the option to seize funds that Western countries hold in Russia.Â© SputnikNEWS LETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address",negative,0.0,0.36,0.63,negative,0.0,0.34,0.66,True,English,"['Frozen Assets', 'Ukraine Support', 'Russia', 'Retaliation', 'EU', 'Use', 'European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen', 'Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov', 'GlobalSecurity.org mailing list', 'The Russian Foreign Ministry', 'Kremlin Spokesman Dmitry Peskov', 'foreign exchange reserves', 'social media site', 'European Peace Facility', 'Russian state assets', 'frozen Russian assets', 'European Union', 'Frozen Assets', 'military aid', 'first tranche', 'immediate reaction', 'illegal decisions', 'military operation', 'G7 countries', 'largest settlement', 'clearing systems', 'Western countries', 'NEWS LETTER', 'Email Address', 'Sputnik News', 'thoughtful actions', 'private funds', 'Ukraine Support', 'EU countries', 'Retaliation', 'Use', 'interest', 'steps', 'reporters', 'Friday', 'revenues', 'Kiev', 'proceeds', 'arms', 'reason', 'response', 'place', 'start', 'half', 'Belgium', 'Euroclear', 'world', 'freezing', 'theft', 'option']",2024-07-27,2024-07-28,globalsecurity.org

These extraordinary revenues generated by EU operators and held by central securities depositories (CSDs) from immobilised Russian sovereign assets were made available by Euroclear to the Commission as a first instalment on 23 July. The money will now be channelled through the European Peace Facility and to the Ukraine Facility to support Ukraine's military capabilities as well as to support the country's reconstruction.The immobilisation of the Russian Central Bank's assets is a result of EU sanctions against Russia  adopted in the wake of its war of aggression against Ukraine. The extraordinary revenues generated in this context by the EU operators do not belong to Russia and are held by CSDs. The EU has now started to channel these revenues to Ukraine.BackgroundIn response to Russia's brutal and unjustified invasion of Ukraine  the European Union and its Member States adopted several packages of restrictive measures (sanctions) against Russia.As part of these sanctions  the assets of the Central Bank of Russia held in the EU were immobilised. The prohibition on transactions related to the assets and reserves of the Central Bank of Russia and its affiliated entities leads to extraordinary and unusual accumulation of cash and deposits on the balance sheets of CSDs from maturing financial instruments and generates extraordinary revenue.Following proposals by the Commission and the High Representative  in February 2024  the Council decided that central securities depositories holding more than â‚¬1 million worth of assets and reserves of the Central Bank of Russia that were immobilised as a result of EU sanctions must set aside extraordinary cash balances accumulating due to EU sanctions and may not dispose of the ensuing net revenues generated by the EU operators.Following the proposals by the Commission and the High Representative in March  on 21 May 2024 the Council adopted a set of legal acts enabling the use of these net profits for the benefit of Ukraine.NEWS LETTER Join the GlobalSecurity.org mailing list Enter Your Email Address,neutral,0.17,0.82,0.01,negative,0.0,0.07,0.93,True,English,"['First transfer', 'Russian assets', 'proceeds', 'support', 'Ukraine', 'GlobalSecurity.org mailing list', 'central securities depositories', 'European Peace Facility', 'ensuing net revenues', 'Russian Central Bank', 'Russian sovereign assets', 'extraordinary cash balances', 'net profits', 'European Union', 'Russian assets', 'First transfer', 'Press release', 'first payment', 'extraordinary revenues', 'first instalment', 'military capabilities', 'unjustified invasion', 'Member States', 'several packages', 'restrictive measures', 'affiliated entities', 'unusual accumulation', 'balance sheets', 'financial instruments', 'High Representative', '1 million worth', 'legal acts', 'NEWS LETTER', 'Email Address', 'EU operators', 'Ukraine Facility', 'European Commission', 'EU sanctions', 'proceeds', 'support', 'July', 'Brussels', 'CSDs', 'Euroclear', 'money', 'country', 'reconstruction', 'immobilisation', 'result', 'wake', 'war', 'aggression', 'context', 'Background', 'response', 'brutal', 'part', 'prohibition', 'transactions', 'reserves', 'deposits', 'proposals', 'February', 'Council', 'March', '21 May', 'use', 'benefit', 'â']",2024-07-27,2024-07-28,globalsecurity.org

The move  announced by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen via social media platform X (formerly Twitter)  aims to support Ukraine's defense and reconstruction efforts amid ongoing conflict with Russian-backed separatists.In response to questions from reporters  Peskov condemned the European Union's actions as ""illegal"" and emphasized that Russia would formulate a calculated and comprehensive response aligned with its national interests. He underscored that the European Commission's decision to allocate funds from frozen Russian assets would not go unanswered  signaling potential diplomatic and economic repercussions.The conflict surrounding the frozen assets dates back to the escalation of the Ukraine crisis in 2022  when Western powers froze nearly USD300 billion belonging to the Central Bank of Russia  primarily housed within Euroclear  the European Union's largest depository. Earlier this year  Brussels approved a plan to utilize interest accrued from these funds to bolster Ukraine's recovery efforts  with the majority earmarked for military aid and a portion allocated for broader support initiatives.The recent announcement by the European Union to begin disbursing interest earnings from frozen Russian assets marks a continuation of efforts by Western nations  including the Group of Seven (G7)  to leverage financial mechanisms in support of Ukraine. The G7 had previously agreed to use interest earnings to finance a substantial loan aimed at facilitating Ukraine's procurement of arms and rehabilitation of critical infrastructure.As tensions persist between Russia and the West over the handling of frozen assets and support for Ukraine  the Kremlin's vow to retaliate underscores the volatile diplomatic landscape and ongoing geopolitical maneuvering in the region.MENAFN28072024000045015687ID1108490746",neutral,0.01,0.93,0.06,negative,0.0,0.14,0.86,True,English,"['Kremlin', 'reply', 'EU', 'confiscation', 'USD', 'European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen', 'social media platform X', 'volatile diplomatic landscape', 'ongoing geopolitical maneuvering', 'broader support initiatives', 'frozen Russian assets', 'European Union', 'frozen assets', 'potential diplomatic', 'stern warning', 'ongoing conflict', 'Russian-backed separatists', 'national interests', 'economic repercussions', 'Western powers', 'Central Bank', 'largest depository', 'military aid', 'recent announcement', 'Western nations', 'financial mechanisms', 'The G7', 'substantial loan', 'critical infrastructure', 'reconstruction efforts', 'recovery efforts', 'interest earnings', 'Kremlin spokesman', 'Dmitry Peskov', 'comprehensive response', 'Ukraine crisis', 'MENAFN', 'decision', 'move', 'Twitter', 'defense', 'questions', 'reporters', 'actions', 'calculated', 'funds', 'escalation', 'Euroclear', 'Brussels', 'plan', 'majority', 'portion', 'continuation', 'Group', 'Seven', 'procurement', 'arms', 'rehabilitation', 'tensions', 'handling', 'vow', 'region']",2024-07-28,2024-07-28,menafn.com
