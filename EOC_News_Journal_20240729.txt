Holding company valuations are a mixed bag at the moment with French rival Publicis leading the pack on a heady €25bn (roughly the same in GBPs) with the UK’s WPP  still the biggest by revenue (just)  worth a distinctly modest £8bn.In the first half of 2024 Havas grew by a respectable 3.4% with £1.3bn in net revenue  behind Publicis and Omnicom but comfortably ahead of Interpublic and  likely  WPP which has yet to report. Havas also has two of the jewels in the global creative crown (assuming there still is one): BETC Paris  the biggest agency in France  and the UK’s Uncommon Creative Studio  currently embarked on an earn-out which may amount to £100m or so.So it may attract the private equity bidders who have been running the rule over WPP and  so far  decided it’s just too complicated to figure out. Conversely  of course  Havas  which now the ability to raise funds on the market  may be an acquirer itself.Havas  unlike Publicis  is relatively weak in the US  still by far the biggest market (Arnold Worldwide is its main vehicle)  although Uncommon is doing its best to remedy that with some high profile work.Another possibility is a move from Droga5 owner Accenture Song. With a reported $18bn in revenue  Accenture Song is up there with Publicis and WPP even though it eschews media  the main driver recently in other groups. Through its ultimate parent  giant consultancy Accenture  it already has most of the digital  ecommerce and consultancy bits its rivals are racing to acquire.Havas Media Group might be an issue  as might a substantial Vivendi holding in the new listed company.

The Americas region stood out  as portfolio mix and major ongoing saving initiatives resulted in a strong operating profit improvement  notably in Brazil and Mexico. APAC returned to growth  led by India and with the Vietnamese beer market stabilizing. We are actively navigating volatility in Africa. In Europe we gained market share in the majority of our markets and beer volume was slightly up compared to last year despite poor weather in June.Our EverGreen strategy continues to shape our business. Premium beer volume grew 5%  led by the Heineken® brand  up 9%. Heineken® was proud to receive a record 22 awards from the Cannes Lions Festival. We consolidated leadership in the Low & No-alcohol category  with Heineken® 0.0 up 14%. We are firmly on-track to deliver €0.5 billion gross savings for 2024  enabling us to invest in growing the category and in building strong brands.In the second half  we will materially step-up investment in market and sales expenditures  with notable increases in key markets. We update our full year outlook to grow operating profit (beia) organically in the range of 4% to 8%  reflecting our confidence in delivery and commitment to invest behind growth and to future-proof our business.""Financial Summary1IFRS Measures € million Total growth BEIA Measures € million Organicgrowth2 Revenue 17 823 2.2% Revenue (beia) 17 812 5.9% Net revenue 14 824 2.1% Net revenue (beia) 14 814 6.0% Operating profit 1 542 -4.3% Operating profit (beia) 2 079 12.5% Operating profit (beia) margin 14.0% Net profit* -95 Net profit (beia) 1 204 4.4% Diluted EPS (in €)* -0.17 Diluted EPS (beia) (in €) 2.15 5.9% *Includes non-cash impairments of €1 050 million in accordance with IFRS (IAS 28 and 36).

While several key emerging markets had to navigate a volatile macroeconomic environment  overall  we achieved more balanced  volume- and value-led revenue growth  and good operating leverage. We also continue to deliver against our premiumisation  digital and sustainability ambitions  funded by gross savings and productivity gains.We continue to expect variable costs to increase organically by a low-single-digit on a per-hectolitre basis. While we expect to benefit from lower commodity and energy prices compared to 2023  this is more than offset by local input cost inflation and currency devaluations  particularly in Africa. We also expect higher than historical average wage inflation.Across the company  our markets and functions realized more than €300 million of gross savings in the first half. We have clear line of sight on our cost saving initiatives and are therefore confident to achieve our c.€500 million ambition for 2024  ahead of our medium-term commitment of €400 million per year.We are reinvesting a larger proportion of these savings into marketing and sales. In the second half  we will materially step-up investment in our brands focused on our greatest opportunities for long-term sustainable growth. Notable increases will be in Mexico  Brazil  Vietnam  India  and South Africa.At the same time  volatility remains a reality. Consumer confidence and economic sentiment in developed markets remain below their historical average. In the Africa & Middle East region there is a risk of material currency devaluation in Ethiopia and hyperinflation in Nigeria and Egypt. We are confident we are able to adapt  yet this continues to bring some short-term uncertainty.Reflecting our confidence in delivery and commitment to invest behind growth and in future-proofing our business  we update our full year outlook to grow operating profit (beia) organically in the range of 4% to 8%.For the full year of 2024  we further expect:An effective interest rate (beia) of around 3.5% (2023: 3.4%).As indicated at our earlier outlook statement  other net finance expenses will increase compared to 2023. This is driven primarily by the impact from significant devaluations and hard currency scarcity in key emerging markets. We made progress in reducing hard currency exposures and are on track with the rights issue in Nigerian Breweries Ltd. If current conditions prevail  we expect more stable other net financing expenses in the second half of the year.We have updated our view on the average effective tax rate (beia)  and now expect this to land at around 28% (2023: 26.8%)  an improvement relative to the previous guidance of 29%  including further insights into Brazil's 2024 tax law changes.Given the factors above  we revise the expected organic net profit (beia) growth to be more closely in line with the expected operating profit (beia) growth.Finally  we continue to expect investments in capital expenditure related to property  plant and equipment and intangible assets to be below 9% of net revenue (beia) (2023: 8.8%).EnquiriesMedia Investors Joris Evers Tristan van Strien Director of Global Communication Director of Investor Relations E-mail: pressoffice@heineken.com Mark Matthews / Chris Steyn Tel: +31-20-5239355 Investor Relations Manager / Senior AnalystE-mail: investors@heineken.com Tel: +31-20-5239590Conference Call DetailsHEINEKEN will host an analyst and investor conference call in relation to its 2024 Half Year results today at 14:00 CET/ 13:00 BST.
