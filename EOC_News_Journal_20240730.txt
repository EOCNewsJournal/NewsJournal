Photograph: Alan BetsonThe chief executive of Euronext  the pan-European stock exchange operator  has confirmed that the group is working on plans to set up a “springboard” market in Dublin for small companies to list  in a bid to stem the erosion of the Irish cash equities market.Stéphane Boujnah  chief executive of Euronext  said in an interview with The Irish Times in Dublin late last week that establishing a Euronext Access market in Dublin  similar to ones operated by the wider group in Paris  Brussels and Lisbon  “could have a big impact in terms of addressing the needs of SMEs”.Euronext Access markets are designed especially for start-ups and small companies that wish to join a stock exchange to finance growth and gain the reputational advantages of listing but do not meet the criteria for admission to main or even junior Euronext markets.[ Irish stock exchange owner pushes for retail investor scheme like UK individual savings accountsOpens in new window ]The chief executive of Euronext Dublin  Daryl Byrne  said companies joining a Euronext Access market could ultimately form a pipeline of businesses that could take out full listings.READ MOREThe self-help initiative  which The Irish Times first reported in June to be under consideration  comes as Euronext is lobbying the Government for assistance to reboot the exchange’s equities business. About half of the trading volume of Euronext Dublin has been wiped away in less than a year with the exits of former Iseq heavyweights CRH  Flutter Entertainment and  earlier this month  Smurfit Kappa  which went on to merge with US rival WestRock to form Smurfit WestRock.The number of companies on the Iseq All-Share index has fallen by more than 50 per cent to 25 since Euronext acquired the what was then known as the Irish Stock Exchange in 2018  as takeovers and delistings of public companies outweighed initial public offerings (IPOs). Only three companies have come to the market in Dublin in the past five years.CRH  Flutter and Smurfit Kappa also exited the FTSE 100 as part of a rejig of their listings that saw each move its main quotation to Wall Street  while keeping a secondary listing in London.[ Government considers incentives to help Dublin stock exchange after loss of big hittersOpens in new window ]“What’s happening in Dublin is much closer to what’s happening in London than the rest of Europe ” said Mr Boujnah. “The rest of Europe… we’re not seeing this exodus of companies  even if we are seeing a smaller number of IPOs.”He noted that this has been exacerbated – among other things – by the growing trend of companies funded by private equity being sold in “second and third rotation” deals to other private equity firms  rather than IPOs being a first exit of choice.Officials from Euronext Dublin and the wider Irish capital markets ecosystem made a submission to the Government in May looking for a series of supports to reboot the domestic equities market.These include: a tax-friendly retail investment plan along the lines of the popular individual savings accounts (ISAs) scheme launched in the UK 25 years ago; Government backing for the establishment of a €400 million cornerstone fund to invest in IPOs; and tax incentives to allow company founders to sell some of their shares as part of a flotation.“Things work when there is a consistent partnership between governments  exchanges and the business community ” said Mr Boujnah.[ Ireland’s stock exchange is in trouble and needs our helpOpens in new window ]Mr Boujnah rejected persistent speculation in Dublin financial circles that Euronext was only ever interested in the Irish exchange’s hugely successful debt and funds listings businesses  rather than its cash equities market.He said the group’s large investment since the takeover in moving trading in Dublin to its Optiq platform and the effort undertaken to shift the settlement of Irish trades from London to Euroclear Brussels post-Brexit reflected its commitment to the market.,neutral,0.0,0.99,0.0,negative,0.0,0.23,0.77,True,English,"['Irish ‘springboard’ market', 'small company listings', 'Euronext CEO', 'plan', 'wider Irish capital markets ecosystem', 'popular individual savings accounts', 'UK individual savings accountsOpens', 'tax-friendly retail investment plan', 'pan-European stock exchange operator', 'other private equity firms', 'Irish stock exchange owner', 'Irish cash equities market', 'The Irish Times', 'retail investor scheme', 'former Iseq heavyweights', 'Iseq All-Share index', 'past five years', '€400 million cornerstone fund', 'Euronext Access markets', 'junior Euronext markets', 'domestic equities market', 'US rival WestRock', 'initial public offerings', 'Stéphane Boujnah', 'Dublin financial circles', 'Dublin stock exchange', 'funds listings businesses', 'Irish exchange', 'Irish trades', 'equities business', 'large investment', 'wider group', 'springboard” market', 'Smurfit WestRock', 'other things', 'ISAs) scheme', 'Mr Boujnah', 'big impact', 'Alan Betson', 'chief executive', 'reputational advantages', 'new window', 'Daryl Byrne', 'full listings', 'READ MORE', 'self-help initiative', 'a year', 'Smurfit Kappa', '50 per cent', 'public companies', 'Wall Street', 'big hittersOpens', 'growing trend', 'third rotation', 'first exit', 'company founders', 'consistent partnership', 'business community', 'persistent speculation', 'successful debt', 'Optiq platform', 'Euronext Dublin', 'small companies', 'trading volume', 'Flutter Entertainment', 'three companies', 'main quotation', 'secondary listing', 'smaller number', 'tax incentives', 'Euroclear Brussels', 'Government backing', 'terms', 'needs', 'SMEs', 'Photograph', 'plans', 'bid', 'erosion', 'interview', 'Paris', 'Lisbon', 'start-ups', 'growth', 'criteria', 'admission', 'pipeline', 'June', 'consideration', 'assistance', 'half', 'less', 'exits', 'CRH', 'takeovers', 'delistings', 'IPOs', 'FTSE', 'rejig', 'London', 'loss', 'rest', 'exodus', 'deals', 'choice', 'Officials', 'submission', 'May', 'series', 'supports', 'lines', 'establishment', 'shares', 'flotation', 'governments', 'exchanges', 'Ireland', 'trouble', 'helpOpens', 'effort', 'settlement', 'Brexit', 'commitment']",2024-07-29,2024-07-30,irishtimes.com
44224,Deutsche Boerse,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/institutional-investors-own-significant-stake-142559012.html,Institutional investors own a significant stake of 42% in Forge Global Holdings  Inc. (NYSE:FRGE),Key Insights Given the large stake in the stock by institutions  Forge Global Holdings' stock price might be vulnerable...,Key InsightsGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions  Forge Global Holdings' stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisionsThe top 10 shareholders own 51% of the companyRecent sales by insidersTo get a sense of who is truly in control of Forge Global Holdings  Inc. (NYSE:FRGE)  it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. The group holding the most number of shares in the company  around 42% to be precise  is institutions. Put another way  the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity  their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight  especially with individual investors. Hence  having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.In the chart below  we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Forge Global Holdings.See our latest analysis for Forge Global HoldingsWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Forge Global Holdings?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.Forge Global Holdings already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed  they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However  it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too  get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Forge Global Holdings  (below). Of course  keep in mind that there are other factors to consider  too.Forge Global Holdings is not owned by hedge funds. Deutsche Boerse AG  Asset Management Arm is currently the largest shareholder  with 13% of shares outstanding. With 7.7% and 5.7% of the shares outstanding respectively  Motive Capital Management  LLC and Paul Luc Heyvaert are the second and third largest shareholders. Furthermore  CEO Kelly Rodriques is the owner of 5.1% of the company's shares.We also observed that the top 10 shareholders account for more than half of the share register  with a few smaller shareholders to balance the interests of the larger ones to a certain extent.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock  so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of Forge Global HoldingsThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders  capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However  it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members  especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However  high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.It seems insiders own a significant proportion of Forge Global Holdings  Inc.. It has a market capitalization of just US$286m  and insiders have US$46m worth of shares in their own names. It is great to see insiders so invested in the business. It might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying recently.General Public OwnershipThe general public  who are usually individual investors  hold a 34% stake in Forge Global Holdings. This size of ownership  while considerable  may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Private Equity OwnershipWith an ownership of 7.7%  private equity firms are in a position to play a role in shaping corporate strategy with a focus on value creation. Some investors might be encouraged by this  since private equity are sometimes able to encourage strategies that help the market see the value in the company. Alternatively  those holders might be exiting the investment after taking it public.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Forge Global Holdings better  we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance  the ever-present spectre of investment risk. We've identified 3 warning signs with Forge Global Holdings   and understanding them should be part of your investment process.If you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth  do not miss this free report on analyst forecasts.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months  which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

In H1/2024  electricity prices were more than one third (-33%) lower on average across the Group’s entire Europe-wide generation portfolio compared to the same period last year (H1/2023). This price-related expected decrease of the revenue of around EUR 12 million is compounded by the negative volume effect of a further EUR 10 million. Operating revenue and operating earnings*) for the same period last year (H1/2023) benefited from a positive one-off effect in the first half-year of 2023 of approximately EUR 8.7 million from the additional payment of the Dutch feed-in tariff for the previous fiscal year 2022.The main reason for the lower production volume of 1 656 gigawatt hours (GWh) in the first half of 2024 compared to 1 734 GWh in the first half of 2023 are mainly the first-time and unplanned curtailment of Spanish solar farms due to negative prices  the significantly lower wind yield in almost all major markets as well as fewer hours of sunshine in Southern Europe. In a direct comparison of existing generation capacities (like-for-like) in the first six months of the 2024 financial year  the Group achieved electricity production from Renewable Energy of around 1 604 GWh compared to 1 734 GWh in the first half of 2023. A decrease of around 7.5%  though differing across segments. The PV Parks segment recorded a decrease in electricity production in H1/2024 of around -9% (-102 GWh)  mainly due to fewer hours of sunshine in Italy  France and Spain. The decrease in electricity production of the Wind segment in H1/2024 of around -4.5% (-28 GWh) is mainly due to the sale of the two wind farms Sohland and Greußen (-20 GWh). The new generation capacity connected to the grid produced around 52 GWh of electricity in the first six months of this year.Net operating revenue*) for the first half of 2024  amounting to approximately EUR 205.7 million  were around 20.5 million euros (-9%) lower than the corresponding prior-year figure of EUR 226.2 million euros (after deducting the electricity price caps in the first half of the previous year).Operating adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortisation (operating EBITDA*) for the first six months of fiscal year 2024 amounted to 126.1 million euros  a significant decrease of around 25.6 million euros (-17%) compared to the previous year’s figure of 151.6 million euros.Operating adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (operating EBIT*) for the first six months of fiscal year 2024 amounted to 65.3 million euros  a significant decrease of around 28.2 million euros (-30%) compared to the previous year’s figure of 93.5 million euros.Operating cash flow decreases in the first six months of fiscal year 2024 significantly by around 17.5 million euros (-15%) to around 96.60 million euros compared to the previous year’s figure of 113.5 million euros.“We look back on a first half-year of 2024 with an extraordinary combination of weather-related lower energy production  simultaneously lower energy prices as well as partially negative prices that result in grid curtailments. We can not continue in our planning with these extraordinary weather conditions – therefore we expect standard weather conditions for the future. We either can not forecast these grid curtailments that haven’t been there before. The following months will show if the risk to adjust the guidance will increase or decrease ” said Dr Christoph Husmann  Spokesman of the Management Board and CFO of Encavis AG  commenting the half-year results 2024.Stern Energy's further growth and the addition of new generation capacity will partially offset the again expected significantly lower energy prices and the decline in revenue at Encavis Asset Management. Additional hours with negative prices and grid curtailments could put the achievement of the guidance for 2024 at risk  especially if paired with unfavorable weather conditions and ongoing regulatory interventions.

If successful  it could be transformative ― but it’s a big if.,"“The capital markets union is moving from a nice-to-have to an absolutely critical must-have ” said Niels Brab  chief regulatory officer at stock exchange group Deutsche Börse.The EU has long trumpeted its single market ― the notion that people  goods and money should be able to move around the bloc as unhindered as if it were just one big country like the United States. In reality it’s failed to live up to that promise  particularly when it comes to the flow of money  and the economic consequences of that are now obvious. The capital markets union is an attempt to put that right.Little wonder then that it has some powerful backers. “We cannot postpone these investments ” French President Emmanuel Macron said earlier this year. And according to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen  her upcoming five-year term is “the time of investment ” which will start with ""completing our capital markets union.”And it's not difficult to see why such a bold vision is needed. The European economy is increasingly lagging behind the U.S. and China. Industry is in a slump. Its cash-strapped startups are smaller and less successful than their overseas rivals. And the EU's fiscal rules mean there’s little public money to spend on moving toward green energy and building up the defense industry in the face of Russian aggression.“We need to finance risky innovation projects to catch up the technological gap with the U.S. ” said Stéphane Boujnah  CEO of Europe’s biggest stock exchange group  Euronext.A pensions-shaped piggybankSo the €10 trillion of Europeans’ savings look very inviting.

The net result of Heineken Holding N.V.'s participating interest in Heineken N.V. for the first half year of 2024 amounts to €-48 million.During the first half of 2024  HEINEKEN continued to execute the EverGreen strategy and restored balanced growth despite experiencing economic volatility in certain markets. Growth remains HEINEKEN's priority and HEINEKEN aspires to shape the future of beer and beyond to win the hearts of consumers. HEINEKEN also aims to become the best digitally connected brewer  raise the bar on sustainability and responsibility and evolve HEINEKEN's capabilities and culture to embrace future opportunities. To fund HEINEKEN's growth  and deliver on the EverGreen ambitions  HEINEKEN continues to drive productivity and capital efficiency in the pursuit of sustainable  long-term value creation.HEINEKEN aims for balanced volume and value growth through building and scaling premium and strategic mainstream brands  supported by innovation in fast-growing consumer segments  excellent commercial execution and further developing HEINEKEN's geographic and portfolio footprint. In the first half of 2024  HEINEKEN saw encouraging signs of consumer demand stabilising and was able to restore balanced growth.Revenue for the first half of 2024 was €17.8 billion  up 2.2%. Net revenue (beia) was €14.8 billion  up 6.0% organically  mainly driven by the growth of HEINEKEN's largest operating companies in Nigeria  Mexico  Brazil  Vietnam and India. Total consolidated volume increased 1.7% and net revenue (beia) per hectolitre was up 4.3% with a positive contribution from all regions  most notably in Africa & Middle East. The underlying price-mix on a constant geographic basis was up 4.9%. Currency translation reduced net revenue (beia) by €625 million or 4.3%  mainly driven by the 48% devaluation of the Nigerian naira versus the euro. Consolidation changes had a positive impact to net revenue (beia) of €51 million  the net result of the Distell and Namibia Breweries acquisitions  the sale of Vrumona in the Netherlands and HEINEKEN's exit from Russia.Beer volume for the first half of 2024 increased organically 2.1% versus last year  with all regions contributing. HEINEKEN gained or held market share in more than half of its markets. Growth in the second quarter was lower as Easter fell in the first quarter in 2024 (versus the second quarter in 2023)  competition intensified in the economy segment in Brazil and poor June weather in Europe.Beer volume 2Q24 Organicgrowth HY24 Organicgrowth (in mhl) 2Q23 HY23 Heineken N.V. 65.3 62.8 -0.1% 120.1 118.2 2.1%Premium beer volume was up 5.1%  ahead of the total beer portfolio in aggregate and in more than half of HEINEKEN's markets. The growth was again led by Heineken®  with further contributions from Kingfisher Ultra  Dos Equis  Desperados and Birra Moretti  amongst others.Heineken® grew volume in the first half by 9.2% with the second quarter up 6.0%. The growth was broad-based  with more than 27 markets growing double-digit  most notably Brazil  China  Vietnam and the DRC. Heineken® Silver grew volume by more than 40%  led by Vietnam and China.The Heineken® brand continues to be admired for its creativity  in both ideas and execution. The brand was recognised as the #1 most creative brand in the alcoholic drinks category and the #2 most creative brand across all categories at the prestigious Cannes Lions Festival of Creativity  taking home a record 22 awards. New campaigns included ""The First Ahhh!""  celebrating its dedication to the craft of brewing and the joy at the first sip from a fresh Heineken®  and ""The Boring Phone""  noting that the more refreshing your social life  the more rewarding it becomes.Heineken® volume 2Q24 Organicgrowth HY23 HY24 Organicgrowth (in mhl) 2Q23 Total 14.2 15.0 6.0% 26.3 28.7 9.2%Outlook StatementsHEINEKEN's EverGreen strategy is a multi-year journey  and HEINEKEN is pleased with the solid progress in the first half of 2024. While several key emerging markets had to navigate a volatile macroeconomic environment  overall  HEINEKEN achieved more balanced  volume- and value-led revenue growth  and good operating leverage. HEINEKEN also continues to deliver against its premiumisation  digital and sustainability ambitions  funded by gross savings and productivity gains.HEINEKEN continues to expect variable costs to increase organically by a low-single-digit on a per hectolitre basis. While HEINEKEN expects to benefit from lower commodity and energy prices compared to 2023  this is more than offset by local input cost inflation and currency devaluations  particularly in Africa. HEINEKEN also expects higher than historical average wage inflation.Across the company  HEINEKEN's markets and functions realized more than €300 million of gross savings in the first half. HEINEKEN has clear line of sight on its cost saving initiatives and is therefore confident to achieve its c.€500 million ambition for 2024  ahead of HEINEKEN's medium-term commitment of €400 million per year.HEINEKEN is reinvesting a larger proportion of these savings into marketing and sales. In the second half  HEINEKEN will materially step-up investment in its brands focused on HEINEKEN's greatest opportunities for long-term sustainable growth. Notable increases will be in Mexico  Brazil  Vietnam  India  and South Africa.At the same time  volatility remains a reality. Consumer confidence and economic sentiment in developed markets remain below their historical average. In the Africa & Middle East region there is a risk of material currency devaluation in Ethiopia and hyperinflation in Nigeria and Egypt. HEINEKEN is confident it is able to adapt  yet this continues to bring some short-term uncertainty.Reflecting HEINEKEN's confidence in delivery and commitment to invest behind growth and in future-proofing its business  HEINEKEN updates its full year outlook to grow operating profit (beia) organically in the range of 4% to 8%.For the full year of 2024  HEINEKEN further expects:An effective interest rate (beia) of around 3.5% (2023: 3.4%).As indicated at HEINEKEN's earlier outlook statement  other net finance expenses will increase compared to 2023. This is driven primarily by the impact from significant devaluations and hard currency scarcity in key emerging markets. HEINEKEN made progress in reducing hard currency exposures and is on track with the rights issue in Nigerian Breweries Ltd. If current conditions prevail  HEINEKEN expects more stable other net financing expenses in the second half of the year.HEINEKEN has updated its view on the average effective tax rate (beia)  and now expect this to land at around 28% (2023: 26.8%)  an improvement relative to the previous guidance of 29%  including further insights into Brazil's 2024 tax law changes.Given the factors above  HEINEKEN revises the expected organic net profit (beia) growth to be more closely in line with the expected operating profit (beia) growth.Finally  HEINEKEN continues to expect investments in capital expenditure related to property  plant and equipment and intangible assets to be below 9% of net revenue (beia) (2023: 8.8%).Translational Calculated Currency ImpactBased on the impact to date  and applying spot rates of 25 July 2024 to the 2023 financial results as a baseline for the remainder of the year  the calculated negative currency translational impact for the full year would be approximately €1.350 million in net revenue (beia)  €170 million at consolidated operating profit (beia)  and €30 million at net profit (beia).Interim Dividend 2024According to the Articles of Association of Heineken Holding N.V. both Heineken Holding N.V. and Heineken N.V. pay an identical dividend per share.

The adjustment follows Euronext's announcement of robust second-quarter results for 2024  which showcased a notable 12% year-over-year organic revenue growth and a 350 basis points expansion in EBITDA margin from the same period last year.Euronext's recent performance has been bolstered by the successful integration of Borsa Italiana  with the final significant phase expected to be the migration of financial derivatives in September. This development is set to enhance the company's business profile and strategic opportunities  which will be further discussed during its Investor Day in November.The financial institution has reaffirmed its Buy rating for Euronext  citing strong near-term revenue momentum and the anticipation of an upward revision in mid-term growth guidance at the upcoming Investor Day. The price target increase to EUR106 reflects modest upgrades in revenue forecasts  underscoring confidence in the stock's future performance.Euronext's current valuation is considered very attractive by the analyst  trading at 13.4 times its estimated earnings per share (EPS) for 2025 and 12 times its estimated enterprise value (EV) to EBIT for the same year. This valuation is reported to be significantly lower than that of its industry peers.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

The Americas region stood out  as portfolio mix and major ongoing saving initiatives resulted in a strong operating profit improvement  notably in Brazil and Mexico. APAC returned to growth  led by India and with the Vietnamese beer market stabilizing. We are actively navigating volatility in Africa. In Europe we gained market share in the majority of our markets and beer volume was slightly up compared to last year despite poor weather in June.Our EverGreen strategy continues to shape our business. Premium beer volume grew 5%  led by the Heineken® brand  up 9%. Heineken® was proud to receive a record 22 awards from the Cannes Lions Festival. We consolidated leadership in the Low & No-alcohol category  with Heineken® 0.0 up 14%. We are firmly on-track to deliver €0.5 billion gross savings for 2024  enabling us to invest in growing the category and in building strong brands.In the second half  we will materially step-up investment in market and sales expenditures  with notable increases in key markets. We update our full year outlook to grow operating profit (beia) organically in the range of 4% to 8%  reflecting our confidence in delivery and commitment to invest behind growth and to future-proof our business.”Financial Summary1IFRS Measures € million Total growth BEIA Measures € million Organicgrowth2 Revenue 17 823 2.2% Revenue (beia) 17 812 5.9% Net revenue 14 824 2.1% Net revenue (beia) 14 814 6.0% Operating profit 1 542 -4.3% Operating profit (beia) 2 079 12.5% Operating profit (beia) margin 14.0% Net profit* -95 Net profit (beia) 1 204 4.4% Diluted EPS (in €)* -0.17 Diluted EPS (beia) (in €) 2.15 5.9% *Includes non-cash impairments of €1 050 million in accordance with IFRS (IAS 28 and 36).

While several key emerging markets had to navigate a volatile macroeconomic environment  overall  we achieved more balanced  volume- and value-led revenue growth  and good operating leverage. We also continue to deliver against our premiumisation  digital and sustainability ambitions  funded by gross savings and productivity gains.We continue to expect variable costs to increase organically by a low-single-digit on a per-hectolitre basis. While we expect to benefit from lower commodity and energy prices compared to 2023  this is more than offset by local input cost inflation and currency devaluations  particularly in Africa. We also expect higher than historical average wage inflation.Across the company  our markets and functions realized more than €300 million of gross savings in the first half. We have clear line of sight on our cost saving initiatives and are therefore confident to achieve our c.€500 million ambition for 2024  ahead of our medium-term commitment of €400 million per year.We are reinvesting a larger proportion of these savings into marketing and sales. In the second half  we will materially step-up investment in our brands focused on our greatest opportunities for long-term sustainable growth. Notable increases will be in Mexico  Brazil  Vietnam  India  and South Africa.At the same time  volatility remains a reality. Consumer confidence and economic sentiment in developed markets remain below their historical average. In the Africa & Middle East region there is a risk of material currency devaluation in Ethiopia and hyperinflation in Nigeria and Egypt. We are confident we are able to adapt  yet this continues to bring some short-term uncertainty.Reflecting our confidence in delivery and commitment to invest behind growth and in future-proofing our business  we update our full year outlook to grow operating profit (beia) organically in the range of 4% to 8%.For the full year of 2024  we further expect:An effective interest rate (beia) of around 3.5% (2023: 3.4%).As indicated at our earlier outlook statement  other net finance expenses will increase compared to 2023. This is driven primarily by the impact from significant devaluations and hard currency scarcity in key emerging markets. We made progress in reducing hard currency exposures and are on track with the rights issue in Nigerian Breweries Ltd. If current conditions prevail  we expect more stable other net financing expenses in the second half of the year.We have updated our view on the average effective tax rate (beia)  and now expect this to land at around 28% (2023: 26.8%)  an improvement relative to the previous guidance of 29%  including further insights into Brazil's 2024 tax law changes.Given the factors above  we revise the expected organic net profit (beia) growth to be more closely in line with the expected operating profit (beia) growth.Finally  we continue to expect investments in capital expenditure related to property  plant and equipment and intangible assets to be below 9% of net revenue (beia) (2023: 8.8%).EnquiriesMedia Investors Joris Evers Tristan van Strien Director of Global Communication Director of Investor Relations E-mail: pressoffice@heineken.com Mark Matthews / Chris Steyn Tel: +31-20-5239355 Investor Relations Manager / Senior AnalystE-mail: investors@heineken.com Tel: +31-20-5239590Conference Call DetailsHEINEKEN will host an analyst and investor conference call in relation to its 2024 Half Year results today at 14:00 CET/ 13:00 BST.

44242,EuroNext,NewsApi.org,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/upcoming-stock-splits-week-july-145301132.html,Upcoming Stock Splits This Week (July 29 to August 2) – Stay Invested,These are the upcoming stock splits for the week of July 29 to August 2  based on TipRanks’ Stock Splits Calendar. A stock split is a corporate action in...,These are the upcoming stock splits for the week of July 29 to August 2  based on TipRanks’ Stock Splits Calendar. A stock split is a corporate action in which  the company issues additional common shares to increase the number of outstanding shares of the company. Accordingly  the stock price of the company’s shares decreases  which maintains the market capitalization before and after the split. In contrast  there are also reverse stock splits that reduce the number of outstanding shares (consolidate). In this case  too  the market cap is maintained as the share price increases following the reverse stock split.Companies often undertake stock splits to improve the liquidity of the common shares and make them more affordable to common investors. Let’s look quickly at the upcoming stock splits for the week.Meta Data Limited ADS (AIU) – Meta Data operates as a core Metaverse technology company and offers solutions to the education field. The company provides technical solutions for creating smart campuses  smart training  and AI (artificial intelligence) computing power. On July 19  Meta Data announced a 1-for-5 reverse stock split (consolidation) of its common shares to comply with the New York Stock Exchange’s (NYSE) minimum bid price requirement for its ADS (American depositary shares). The reverse stock split took effect this morning  and the ADS are expected to start trading on a split-adjusted basis when markets open.Ashford Inc. (AINC) – Ashford Inc. is a global asset management company that offers asset management  investment management  and related services to the real estate and hospitality sectors. On July 22  Ashford announced that shareholders approved a 1-for-10 000 reverse stock split of AINC shares in a Special meeting. Moreover  shareholders approved a forward stock split of 10 000-for-1 of its common stock. This decision was taken to delist Ashford’s common shares from the NYSE American exchange to save the expenses associated with being a publicly traded company.Sacks Parente Golf  Inc. (SPGC) – Sacks Parente Golf is a technology-forward golf company. SPGC manufactures and sells putting instruments  golf shafts  golf grips  and other golf-related products. On July 24  SPGC’s board approved a 1-for-10 reverse stock split of its common shares to comply with the Nasdaq Capital Market’s minimum bid price requirement of $1 per share. SPGC shares will undergo the reverse split on July 30 and start trading on a split-adjusted basis when the market opens.Concord Medical Services Holding Ltd. (CCM) – China-based Concord Medical Services is a medical service provider with a focus on cancer prevention  diagnosis  treatment  education  and research. The company operates radiotherapy and diagnostic imaging centers in China. On July 12  Concord Medical announced a change to its ADS structure that will result in a reverse stock split of 1-for-10 ADS. The structure has been changed from one ADS representing 3 Class A shares to one ADS representing 30 Class A shares. The ADS will start trading on a split-adjusted basis on July 30. The company took the decision to comply with NYSE’s minimum pricing requirement for its ADS.Story continuesViridien SA (CGGYY) – Viridien is a technology-based digital and geological company. It combines human ingenuity  data  and new technology to understand and solve natural resource  environmental  and infrastructure challenges for a more sustainable future.

The shares are expected to start listing on a split-adjusted basis on July 31  on the Euronext stock exchange.XMReality AB (XMMRF) – XMReality is a technology company that offers remote visual assistance solutions using AR (augmented reality).

Green Square’s Barry Dudley analyzes the latest results from IPG and Havas.After some strong results from Publicis  which included the guidance for full-year organic revenue growth being lifted from 4-5% up to 5-6%  we saw 5.2% organic growth in the second quarter from Omnicom. However  the latest round of financial results revealed last week by IPG and Havas paint a different picture.Two words from the first sentence of the press release sum up IPG’s performance – “solid” and “moderate.” With 1.7% organic growth for the quarter and guidance of 1% for the year  I’d argue this is a group that’s simply treading water.There was talk of initiatives in AI  strong retail media performance and broadening their offer to solve more of the challenges that clients face  as we might expect. But there were two problem areas: first  the “tech and telecom sector continued to weigh on growth ” in particular the “loss of a large AOR assignment with a telco client late last year” that is continuing to hurt it  and second  “in keeping with recent quarters…underperformance at our digital specialist agencies.”Good news for us at Green Square was that M&A is still on the agenda as a more rapid route to increasing capabilities and growth overall.Powered by AI Explore frequently asked questionsNext came the Vivendi group results  of which Havas is just one piece. Vivendi’s organic revenue growth for H1 was 5.8%  just ahead of Publicis and Omnicom. Canal+ and Lagardere make up over 80% of Vivendi’s revenues  so the fact that Havas delivered only 0.3% organic growth gets somewhat lost. For Q2  Havas actually had an organic decline of 2.3%  which pretty much wiped out its Q1 growth.Much like IPG  this was mainly down to a “partial loss of a big client in the US ” which left that geography down 6.4% for H1. The impact of this loss will also be felt in Q3  but the hope is for a return to organic growth in Q4 or maybe in 2025. This leaves a lot for the acquisitions to cover off to maintain overall growth.AdvertisementIt was announced earlier this week that another step had been taken towards separately listing Havas  which looks set to be on the Euronext Exchange in Amsterdam. There will be no hiding within Vivendi’s numbers once this has happened. Fascinatingly  Canal+ looks to be heading for a listing on the London Stock Exchange.It will be interesting to see how the Converged strategy  which was announced in June  unfolds and it was again positive to see reference to future M&A: “Virtually zero net debt [in Havas] to seize investment opportunities in the future.”This all made me think back to Nigel Bogle’s infamous statement: “I’m only ever three phone calls away from disaster.” This was said when BBH was an independent agency and losing a client (or three!) could potentially impact the viability of a business. IPG and Havas clearly have scale and diversity of revenues that protect them from three phone calls becoming a “disaster ” but it would appear that just one phone call can create a pretty big bump.,neutral,0.01,0.94,0.05,mixed,0.34,0.25,0.41,True,English,"['Flat figures', 'Q2 results', 'IPG', 'Havas', 'water', 'strong retail media performance', 'full-year organic revenue growth', 'large AOR assignment', 'digital specialist agencies', 'zero net debt', 'three phone calls', 'two problem areas', 'London Stock Exchange', 'one phone call', 'Holding company results', 'future M&A', 'Vivendi group results', 'strong results', '5.2% organic growth', '1.7% organic growth', '0.3% organic growth', 'Two words', 'one piece', 'Euronext Exchange', 'organic decline', 'latest results', 'financial results', 'Q1 growth', 'overall growth', 'Green Square', 'Barry Dudley', 'latest round', 'different picture', 'first sentence', 'press release', 'telecom sector', 'recent quarters', 'Good news', 'rapid route', 'Converged strategy', 'investment opportunities', 'Nigel Bogle', 'infamous statement', 'independent agency', 'big bump', 'telco client', 'big client', 'second quarter', 'partial loss', 'IPG', 'Havas', 'Publicis', 'guidance', 'Omnicom', 'water', 'talk', 'initiatives', 'offer', 'challenges', 'clients', 'tech', 'underperformance', 'agenda', 'capabilities', 'questions', 'H1', 'Canal+', 'Lagardere', 'revenues', 'fact', 'geography', 'impact', 'hope', 'return', 'Q4', 'lot', 'acquisitions', 'Advertisement', 'step', 'Amsterdam', 'hiding', 'numbers', 'listing', 'June', 'reference', 'disaster', 'BBH', 'viability', 'business', 'scale', 'diversity']",2024-07-29,2024-07-30,thedrum.com

DBV is currently focused on investigating the use of its proprietary technology platform  Viaskin  to address food allergies  which are caused by a hypersensitive immune reaction and characterized by a range of symptoms varying in severity from mild to life-threatening anaphylaxis. Millions of people live with food allergies  including young children. Through epicutaneous immunotherapy (EPIT™)  the Viaskin platform is designed to introduce microgram amounts of a biologically active compound to the immune system through intact skin. EPIT is a new class of non-invasive treatment that seeks to modify an individual’s underlying allergy by re-educating the immune system to become desensitized to allergen by leveraging the skin’s immune tolerizing properties. DBV is committed to transforming the care of food allergic people. The Company’s food allergy programs include ongoing clinical trials of Viaskin Peanut in peanut allergic toddlers (1 through 3 years of age) and children (4 through 7 years of age).DBV Technologies is headquartered in Châtillon  France  with North American operations in Warren  NJ.

Photograph: Alan BetsonThe chief executive of Euronext  the pan-European stock exchange operator  has confirmed that the group is working on plans to set up a “springboard” market in Dublin for small companies to list  in a bid to stem the erosion of the Irish cash equities market.Stéphane Boujnah  chief executive of Euronext  said in an interview with The Irish Times in Dublin late last week that establishing a Euronext Access market in Dublin  similar to ones operated by the wider group in Paris  Brussels and Lisbon  “could have a big impact in terms of addressing the needs of SMEs”.Euronext Access markets are designed especially for start-ups and small companies that wish to join a stock exchange to finance growth and gain the reputational advantages of listing but do not meet the criteria for admission to main or even junior Euronext markets.[ Irish stock exchange owner pushes for retail investor scheme like UK individual savings accountsOpens in new window ]The chief executive of Euronext Dublin  Daryl Byrne  said companies joining a Euronext Access market could ultimately form a pipeline of businesses that could take out full listings.READ MOREThe self-help initiative  which The Irish Times first reported in June to be under consideration  comes as Euronext is lobbying the Government for assistance to reboot the exchange’s equities business. About half of the trading volume of Euronext Dublin has been wiped away in less than a year with the exits of former Iseq heavyweights CRH  Flutter Entertainment and  earlier this month  Smurfit Kappa  which went on to merge with US rival WestRock to form Smurfit WestRock.The number of companies on the Iseq All-Share index has fallen by more than 50 per cent to 25 since Euronext acquired the what was then known as the Irish Stock Exchange in 2018  as takeovers and delistings of public companies outweighed initial public offerings (IPOs). Only three companies have come to the market in Dublin in the past five years.CRH  Flutter and Smurfit Kappa also exited the FTSE 100 as part of a rejig of their listings that saw each move its main quotation to Wall Street  while keeping a secondary listing in London.[ Government considers incentives to help Dublin stock exchange after loss of big hittersOpens in new window ]“What’s happening in Dublin is much closer to what’s happening in London than the rest of Europe ” said Mr Boujnah. “The rest of Europe… we’re not seeing this exodus of companies  even if we are seeing a smaller number of IPOs.”He noted that this has been exacerbated – among other things – by the growing trend of companies funded by private equity being sold in “second and third rotation” deals to other private equity firms  rather than IPOs being a first exit of choice.Officials from Euronext Dublin and the wider Irish capital markets ecosystem made a submission to the Government in May looking for a series of supports to reboot the domestic equities market.These include: a tax-friendly retail investment plan along the lines of the popular individual savings accounts (ISAs) scheme launched in the UK 25 years ago; Government backing for the establishment of a €400 million cornerstone fund to invest in IPOs; and tax incentives to allow company founders to sell some of their shares as part of a flotation.“Things work when there is a consistent partnership between governments  exchanges and the business community ” said Mr Boujnah.[ Ireland’s stock exchange is in trouble and needs our helpOpens in new window ]Mr Boujnah rejected persistent speculation in Dublin financial circles that Euronext was only ever interested in the Irish exchange’s hugely successful debt and funds listings businesses  rather than its cash equities market.He said the group’s large investment since the takeover in moving trading in Dublin to its Optiq platform and the effort undertaken to shift the settlement of Irish trades from London to Euroclear Brussels post-Brexit reflected its commitment to the market.,neutral,0.0,0.99,0.0,negative,0.0,0.23,0.77,True,English,"['Irish ‘springboard’ market', 'small company listings', 'Euronext CEO', 'plan', 'wider Irish capital markets ecosystem', 'popular individual savings accounts', 'UK individual savings accountsOpens', 'tax-friendly retail investment plan', 'pan-European stock exchange operator', 'other private equity firms', 'Irish stock exchange owner', 'Irish cash equities market', 'The Irish Times', 'retail investor scheme', 'former Iseq heavyweights', 'Iseq All-Share index', 'past five years', '€400 million cornerstone fund', 'Euronext Access markets', 'junior Euronext markets', 'domestic equities market', 'US rival WestRock', 'initial public offerings', 'Stéphane Boujnah', 'Dublin financial circles', 'Dublin stock exchange', 'funds listings businesses', 'Irish exchange', 'Irish trades', 'equities business', 'large investment', 'wider group', 'springboard” market', 'Smurfit WestRock', 'other things', 'ISAs) scheme', 'Mr Boujnah', 'big impact', 'Alan Betson', 'chief executive', 'reputational advantages', 'new window', 'Daryl Byrne', 'full listings', 'READ MORE', 'self-help initiative', 'a year', 'Smurfit Kappa', '50 per cent', 'public companies', 'Wall Street', 'big hittersOpens', 'growing trend', 'third rotation', 'first exit', 'company founders', 'consistent partnership', 'business community', 'persistent speculation', 'successful debt', 'Optiq platform', 'Euronext Dublin', 'small companies', 'trading volume', 'Flutter Entertainment', 'three companies', 'main quotation', 'secondary listing', 'smaller number', 'tax incentives', 'Euroclear Brussels', 'Government backing', 'terms', 'needs', 'SMEs', 'Photograph', 'plans', 'bid', 'erosion', 'interview', 'Paris', 'Lisbon', 'start-ups', 'growth', 'criteria', 'admission', 'pipeline', 'June', 'consideration', 'assistance', 'half', 'less', 'exits', 'CRH', 'takeovers', 'delistings', 'IPOs', 'FTSE', 'rejig', 'London', 'loss', 'rest', 'exodus', 'deals', 'choice', 'Officials', 'submission', 'May', 'series', 'supports', 'lines', 'establishment', 'shares', 'flotation', 'governments', 'exchanges', 'Ireland', 'trouble', 'helpOpens', 'effort', 'settlement', 'Brexit', 'commitment']",2024-07-29,2024-07-30,irishtimes.com

The SBTi notably praised the Group's net-zero ambition  recognized as the most ambitious among those it tracks.At the heart of Veolia's performance model  decarbonization is a powerful driver and a source of value creation for the Group and its clients in the long term. This pragmatic and action-oriented approach allows Veolia to display significant progress in achieving its objectives.

In 2023  Veolia contributed to erase 13.8 Mt of emissions.Overall  the emission reduction targets of the Group's validated climate trajectory are aligned with a 1.5 °C trajectory set by the Paris Agreement. These targets are part of the GreenUp strategic program:50% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2032  notably through the acceleration of our investments to phase out coal in Europe and capture biogas at our waste storage sitesIncrease of 50% in erased emissions for our clients (Scope 4) by 2030Achievement of carbon neutrality by 2050Furthermore  the international rating agency Moody's also analyzed and recognized the quality of Veolia's transition plan  awarding the company an overall score of NZ-2 (on a scale of NZ-1 to NZ-5)  and praising the ambition and solidity of its short-term implementation. This is based in particular on the use of proven technologies by the Group and a higher than average return on transition investments.Veolia thus becomes the first company to obtain double validation of its climate commitments by two leading international organizations.""Veolia is a major player in decarbonization and a company resolutely focused on action.

The first and immediate step to reduce carbon emissions is to leverage efficiencies in the process or design. We are pleased that Chevron Phillips Chemical has selected Technip Energies’ proprietary low-emission cracking furnace for this project at its Sweeny complex.”Venki Chandrashekar  vice president  Research & Technology at CPChem added: “Our company is focused on initiatives and projects that are cost effective and have a significant impact on lowering the intensity of emissions generated by the production of the basic chemicals that society needs. We are pleased to work with Technip Energies to implement the proprietary Low-CO₂ Emissions Cracking Furnace and progress toward our goal to reduce carbon intensity.”About Technip EnergiesTechnip Energies is a leading Engineering & Technology company for the energy transition  with leadership positions in LNG  hydrogen and ethylene as well as growing market positions in blue and green hydrogen  sustainable chemistry and CO 2 management.

The Group's main operator-customers are gradually rebuilding their Access equipment inventory  without reaching normative levels.Conversely  sales of Optical Transport solutions were down -41% in H1 2024  after an all-time high performance in 2023 (+41% in H1 2023 and +27% on a full-year basis). This business line was mainly impacted by (i) reluctance from operators with substantial inventory to initiate CAPEX (capital expenditure)  (ii) slower growth for 2023 internet traffic in a context of overcapacity and (iii) a wait-and-see attitude triggered by the delayed launch of Ekinops' new 800G optical solution.Software & Services accounted for 17% of Group revenue  with an increasing share of recurring revenue  particularly for the SD-WAN solution.Geographically  H1 2024 revenue increased by +5% in France while international business declined by -31%. International sales for this first half came out to 56% (vs. 66% a year earlier)  of which 22% in North America (down -31%)  32% in EMEA (Europe  Middle East and Africa  down -32%) and 2% in Asia-Pacific (decline of -15%).H1 2024 gross margin: 56.1%At mid-year  gross margin stood at 32.2m€  versus 37.7m€ Y-o-Y.Gross margin thus reached a record level of 56.1% in H1 2024  vs. 53.1% a year earlier and 52.1% end-2023.This record gross margin performance results from a favorable business mix (growth in the Access business line)  a solid ""selling price/manufacturing costs"" ratio for Ekinops' solutions  and the increasing share of Software & Services' in Group's revenue.H1 2024 EBITDA margin[1]: 14.3%At mid-year  EBITDA came to 8.2m€ vs. 14.3m€ Y-o-Y  with a -6% decline in operating expenses  driven by carefully managed costs (-11% in general costs  -6% in R&D costs and -3% in marketing and sales costs).As such  H1 2024 EBITDA margin was 14.3%  compared to an exceptional 20.2% a year earlier and 14.4% in FY 2023.After accounting for net depreciation  amortization and provisions (4.1m€  including 1.1m€of amortization relating to post purchase price allocation technologies)  declining due to the discontinued amortization of OneAccess technology  and non-cash expenses relating to share-based payments (0.6m€)  current operating income came to 3.0m€ in H1 2024 vs. 6.7m€ a year earlier.Current operating margin therefore stood at 5.1% of half-year revenue  vs. 9.4% the same period last year and 3.9% in FY 2023.H1 2024 adjusted EBIT: 7.0%Excluding amortization of intangible assets identified post purchase price allocation  adjusted current operating margin (adjusted EBIT[2]) came to 7.0%  vs. 14.0% a year earlier and 8.0% at end-2023.Other operating expenses totaled 0.4m€  resulting in operating income of 2.6m€ for H1 2024 vs. 6.6m€ Y-o-Y and 3.6m€ for FY 2023.After taking into account financial expenses of 0.7m€  comprising a net interest expense and foreign exchange gains on currency hedging  and a tax expense of 0.4m€  H1 2024 net income stood at 1.5m€  vs. 6.0m€ a year earlier and 3.6m€ in FY 2023H1 2024 operating cash flow: 5.1m€Despite the economic challenges impacting its business  Ekinops showed once again resilience with an ability to generate cash through its operations.At mid-year  operating cash flow totaled 5.1m€  up significantly compared with H1 2023 (+0.9m€). Change in working capital requirements was limited to €2.1m  down considerably from the previous year (13.1m€ in H1 2023  boosted by the sharp increase in accounts receivable). H1 2024 decrease in accounts receivable (-3.4m€) notably offset rising inventory (3.3m€) as a result of slower business activity.Cash flow from investments (non-current assets and R&D) amounted to -5.7m€ (vs. -4.5m€ a year earlier)  with 1.1m€ in equipment investments and 4.5m€ for capitalized R&D and the acquisition of the 5View software suite.Cash flow from financing activities totaled -4.7m€  including -2.5m€ in repayments under bank loans.

This increased the Group's right-of-use assets to 12.4m€.Cash and cash equivalents totaled 41.8m€ as of 30 June 2024  for financial borrowings[4] of 19.5m€.As such  Ekinops benefited from a healthy financial position at the end of H1 2024  with net cash at 22.3m€ (vs. 20.3m€ a year earlier and 25.8m€ at end-2023) with shareholders' equity of 120.4m€ (vs. 119.4m€ as of 31 December 2023).Subsequent to the semester  Ekinops secured a 1.8m€ subsidy  granted by the French government and Bpifrance as part of the ""ORANGE MECT PART"" major project of common European interest (PIIEC) initiative. The latter was developed in collaboration with Orange and its partners  to provide innovative connectivity solutions for specific configurations or digital deserts  as an alternative to current transmission solutions.OutlookAgainst a sluggish economic backdrop  Ekinops proved resilient thanks to a strong gross margin  sound management of operating expenses and a further demonstrated ability to generate cash flow despite the slowdown in business.In Access  the gradual normalization of operator inventories in France led Ekinops to report modest growth for this segment over the semester. Looking ahead to H2 2024  the Group aims to accelerate this trend  both in France and EMEA  conditional on a favorable economic recovery. In Optical Transport  the launch of the 800G solution with its innovative features and the cost-optimized 100G product should spark fresh momentum in this business line over the coming semesters.In this context  Ekinops expects Q3 2024 revenue to follow the same trend as previous quarters  with a more marked improvement in business targeted for Q4 2024.In terms of external growth  Ekinops still aims to carry out operations to consolidate the Group  strengthen its offering and expand its customer base  favoring a non-dilutive source of financing.See 2024 financial calendar here.All press releases are published after Euronext Paris market close.EKINOPS ContactDidier Brédy  Chairman and CEO[email protected]InvestorsMathieu Omnes  Investor relationTel.: +33 (0)1 53 67 36 92[email protected]PressAmaury Dugast  Press relationTel.: +33 (0)1 53 67 36 74[email protected][1] EBITDA (Earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization) corresponds to current operating income restated for (i) amortization  depreciation and provisions  and (ii) income and expenses relating to share-based payments.[2] Adjusted EBIT corresponds to current operating income adjusted for amortization of intangible assets identified after allocation of goodwill  Technologies developed and Customer relations.[3] Net cash = cash and cash equivalents - borrowings (excluding bank debt relating to French research tax credit (CIR) pre-financing and IFRS 16 lease liabilities)[4] excluding bank debt relating to French research tax credit (CIR) pre-financing and IFRS 16 lease liabilitiesPhoto: https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2470933/ekinops.jpgLogo: https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/814911/4833785/Ekinops_Logo.jpgSOURCE Ekinops",neutral,0.01,0.99,0.0,negative,0.0,0.14,0.86,True,English,"['Ekinops H1 2024 results', 'EBITDA margin', 'solid ""selling price/manufacturing costs"" ratio', ""Ekinops' new 800G optical solution"", 'purchase price allocation technologies', 'post purchase price allocation', 'record gross margin performance', 'H1 2024 operating cash flow', 'time high performance', 'Optical Transport solutions', 'constant exchange rates', 'foreign exchange gains', 'Current operating margin', 'working capital requirements', 'favorable business mix', 'Access equipment inventory', 'Current operating income', 'Consolidated net income', 'half-year financial statements', 'Access business line', 'slower business activity', 'Other operating expenses', 'R&D costs', 'H1 2024 financial statements', 'net interest expense', 'H1 2024 gross margin', 'H1 2024 net income', 'H1 2024 EBITDA margin', 'SD-WAN solution', 'record level', 'financial expenses', 'general costs', 'capital expenditure', 'tax expense', 'international business', 'cash expenses', 'sales costs', 'telecommunications solutions', 'substantial inventory', ""Ekinops' solutions"", 'rising inventory', 'half-year revenue', 'net depreciation', 'leading supplier', 'statutory auditors', 'interim review', 'share-based payments', 'main operator-customers', 'normative levels', 'full-year basis', 'slower growth', '2023 internet traffic', 'increasing share', 'first half', 'North America', 'Middle East', 'OneAccess technology', 'intangible assets', 'currency hedging', 'economic challenges', 'previous year', 'sharp increase', 'accounts receivable', 'non-current assets', 'H1 2024 decrease', 'sales rebound', 'International sales', 'The Group', 'recurring revenue', 'Euronext Paris', 'telecom operators', 'same period', 'H1 2024 revenue', 'Group revenue', '1 EBITDA', 'July', 'PRNewswire', 'enterprises', '30 June', 'Board', 'Directors', 'IFRS', 'H2', 'EBITDA1', 'Earnings', 'taxes', 'amortization', 'provisions', 'France', 'decline', 'reluctance', 'CAPEX', 'context', 'overcapacity', 'wait', 'attitude', 'delayed', 'launch', 'Software', 'Services', 'EMEA', 'Europe', 'Africa', 'Asia-Pacific', 'mid-year', '14.3m', 'marketing', 'exceptional 20.', 'FY', '6.6m', 'resilience', 'ability', 'operations', 'result', 'investments', '3.1', '3.6', '1.5']",2024-07-06,2024-07-30,finanznachrichten.de
