This change takes effect immediately and the RBI has not provided a reason for the …,ETMarkets.comETMarkets.comET Guide to ITR ITR Filing Last Date 2024 Extension Live Updates(You can now subscribe to our(You can now subscribe to our ETMarkets WhatsApp channelIndia will shield more of its bonds from foreign ownership  in a sign it’s uncomfortable with the billions of dollars of inflows linked to the inclusion of its debt in a key global index Overseas investors will no longer be able to freely buy freshly issued Indian government bonds with 14-year and 30-year tenors  according to a statement by the central bank. The change is effective immediately  the Reserve Bank of India said  without citing a reason.The move comes a month after JPMorgan Chase & Co. began including Indian government securities in its main emerging market index  and amid increased volatility in global markets caused by election results and central banks adjusting policy.The country’s joining the gauge marked a significant milestone  offering global investors improved access to one of the best-performing but tightly regulated debt markets  with one of the lowest foreign ownership ratios among emerging economies.“It’s a bit of a surprise announcement. It’s also not very clear why the bank has chosen to exclude those two securities ” Neeraj Gambhir  group executive for treasury  markets & wholesale banking products at Axis Bank Ltd. told Bloomberg Television on Tuesday. However  given that the pool of securities available to foreigners is quite large  “as far as the index-related flows are concerned  I don’t think it should have a material impact on it.”Authorities might amend the rules for issuance of such securities to curb hot money flows and volatility  Bloomberg reported last week  citing a top finance ministry official.A spokeswoman for JPMorgan declined to comment when asked by Bloomberg whether the July 29 directive would lead to a change in the composition of securities included its index. The RBI did not immediately respond to Bloomberg’s request for comment.India’s local-currency bonds are the top performers in emerging Asian this year  handing investors a return of 8.1%  data compiled by Bloomberg show. The yield on India’s existing 30-year security was little changed on Tuesday.Global funds have poured more than $12 billion into freely accessible bonds since India’s index inclusion of was announced in September. The RBI has bought up dollars coming in  with its foreign exchange reserves swelling to a record  in order to keep the rupee on an even keel.Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and others have estimated that India’s accession to the gauge would attract flows of as much as $40 billion. The country’s weight will progressively rise to 10%.Long wary of the kind of capital flows that led to the Asian financial crisis  India opened a swath of its sovereign bond market to overseas investors in 2020. Having removed Russian bonds from its widely-tracked indexes following the 2022 invasion of Ukraine  JPMorgan announced India’s inclusion last September.But unlike China  which made a number of changes changes to its debt market before joining the Wall Street bank’s gauge in 2020  New Delhi has balked at tax changes for foreigners that would have facilitated the trading of Indian debt on international platforms such as Euroclear.“It does point to the fact that the government continues to be reluctant to encourage foreign bond inflows ” said Shamaila Khan  UBS Asset Management’s head of fixed income for emerging markets and Asia Pacific.There are currently more than 30 FAR securities  according to The Clearing Corp. of India,neutral,0.39,0.59,0.03,mixed,0.22,0.18,0.6,True,English,"['global funds', 'new curbs', 'bond ownership', 'India', 'bay', 'Last Date 2024 Extension Live Updates', 'key global index Overseas investors', 'top finance ministry official', 'Goldman Sachs Group Inc.', 'lowest foreign ownership ratios', 'main emerging market index', 'wholesale banking products', 'foreign exchange reserves', 'sovereign bond market', 'UBS Asset Management', 'existing 30-year security', 'Asian financial crisis', 'The Clearing Corp.', 'Axis Bank Ltd', 'freely accessible bonds', 'Wall Street bank', 'hot money flows', 'foreign bond inflows', 'ETMarkets WhatsApp channel', 'Indian government bonds', 'Indian government securities', 'global investors', 'group executive', 'top performers', 'emerging Asian', 'Global funds', 'debt market', '30-year tenors', 'global markets', 'emerging economies', 'Indian debt', 'The RBI', 'emerging markets', 'central bank', 'Reserve Bank', 'local-currency bonds', 'Russian bonds', 'ET Guide', 'ITR ITR', 'election results', 'significant milestone', 'surprise announcement', 'Neeraj Gambhir', 'index-related flows', 'material impact', 'July 29 directive', 'capital flows', 'changes changes', 'New Delhi', 'tax changes', 'international platforms', 'Shamaila Khan', 'fixed income', 'Asia Pacific', 'two securities', '30 FAR securities', 'Bloomberg Television', 'Bloomberg show', 'JPMorgan Chase', 'billions', 'dollars', 'inclusion', '14-year', 'statement', 'reason', 'move', 'Co.', 'volatility', 'policy', 'country', 'gauge', 'improved', 'performing', 'bit', 'treasury', 'Tuesday', 'pool', 'foreigners', 'Authorities', 'rules', 'issuance', 'spokeswoman', 'composition', 'request', 'comment', 'return', 'data', 'yield', 'September', 'record', 'order', 'rupee', 'keel', 'others', 'accession', 'weight', 'kind', 'swath', 'indexes', '2022 invasion', 'Ukraine', 'China', 'number', 'trading', 'Euroclear', 'fact', 'head']",2024-07-30,2024-07-31,economictimes.indiatimes.com

Regulatory Shifts Bolster Digital Asset Products,Fidelity International's Physical Bitcoin ETP is now listed on the London Stock Exchange  marking a pivotal moment for institutional crypto investments in the UK.Regulatory Shifts Bolster Digital Asset ProductsThe London Stock Exchange (LSE) now lists Fidelity International's Physical Bitcoin ETP.Attracting a lot of interest from institutional investors is a big deal for digital assets in the UK. Optimism among crypto market participants has been bolstered by this revelation  which comes amid a lot of chatter in the ETF sector.The new product from Fidelity follows the FCA's decision to permit crypto asset-backed Exchange Traded Notes (ETNs) for institutional investors. Companies such as Fidelity  WisdomTree  and Global X are now able to offer digital asset products to customers in the UK because of this shift in regulations.Fidelity's Competitive Edge with Reduced FeesAt the same time  Bitcoin itself backs the Fidelity Physical Bitcoin ETP  which attempts to follow price fluctuations in Bitcoin. Its ongoing charges figure (OCF) has been drastically cut from 0.75% to just 0.35%  giving it a competitive edge. The increasing interest in cryptocurrency on a global scale was brought to light by Stefan Kuhn  Head of ETF & Index Distribution in Europe at Fidelity.Coingape reports that the first Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) were approved in the US  he said  and that was the reason for the spike. Kuhn claims that the license by the FCA shows how popular and in-demand digital assets are that are traded on regulated and secure platforms. He stressed the importance of the Fidelity Physical Bitcoin ETP as a safe and easy way for UK-based professionals to invest in Bitcoin.Investors now have an easy and affordable method to get exposure to Bitcoin with the launch of this ETP by Fidelity. The utmost security and dependability are guaranteed by Fidelity Digital Assets (FDA)  which acts as the custodian. Bitcoin ETP  which debuted in February 2022 on the SIX Swiss Exchange and the Deutsche Börse Xetra  is now available to investors in the UK directly.Institutional Interest in Bitcoin GrowsThere has been a general uptick in institutional interest in the bitcoin market  and Fidelity's decision is in line with that. The product's decreased cost figure makes it more appealing to professional investors and makes it one of the most reasonably priced Bitcoin ETPs.Notably  Fidelity's dedication to providing value while upholding high standards of security and simplicity is highlighted by this smart pricing decision. The debut also marks a significant change in the UK's financial scene  as digital assets are becoming more accepted and legitimate by institutions.Fidelity adds to the growing body of evidence supporting Bitcoin and other digital assets as legitimate investment opportunities by going public on the London Stock Exchange.,neutral,0.05,0.95,0.0,positive,0.6,0.39,0.01,True,English,"['London Stock Exchange', 'Institutional Crypto Access', 'Bitcoin ETP', 'Fidelity', 'crypto asset-backed Exchange Traded Notes', 'Deutsche Börse Xetra', 'The London Stock Exchange', 'first Bitcoin exchange-traded funds', 'Fidelity Physical Bitcoin ETP', 'SIX Swiss Exchange', 'crypto market participants', 'legitimate investment opportunities', 'institutional crypto investments', 'Digital Asset Products', 'ongoing charges figure', 'demand digital assets', 'other digital assets', 'smart pricing decision', 'Fidelity Digital Assets', 'bitcoin market', 'cost figure', 'Bitcoin ETPs', 'pivotal moment', 'Regulatory Shifts', 'big deal', 'Global X', 'Competitive Edge', 'Reduced Fees', 'same time', 'price fluctuations', 'global scale', 'Index Distribution', 'secure platforms', 'UK-based professionals', 'affordable method', 'general uptick', 'high standards', 'significant change', 'financial scene', 'growing body', 'Institutional Interest', 'institutional investors', 'Fidelity International', 'increasing interest', 'professional investors', 'ETF sector', 'new product', 'Stefan Kuhn', 'easy way', 'utmost security', 'LSE', 'lot', 'Optimism', 'revelation', 'chatter', 'FCA', 'ETNs', 'Companies', 'WisdomTree', 'customers', 'regulations', 'OCF', 'cryptocurrency', 'light', 'Head', 'Europe', 'Coingape', 'ETFs', 'reason', 'spike', 'license', 'popular', 'regulated', 'importance', 'safe', 'exposure', 'launch', 'dependability', 'FDA', 'custodian', 'February', 'line', 'dedication', 'value', 'simplicity', 'debut', 'institutions', 'evidence']",2024-07-31,2024-07-31,econotimes.com

This regulatory change has paved the way for firms like 21Shares  WisdomTree  and Global X to introduce similar products to the UK market.Stefan Kuhn  Fidelity International’s Head of ETF & Index Distribution Europe  commented on the development:“The FCA’s decision to authorize crypto asset-backed ETNs for professional investors is a positive development and reflects the increasing acceptance and demand of digital assets offered through a secure and regulated exchange.

With revenues up by 11.3% to €13.1m  COIL has recorded an improvement in its business  driven by a rebound in tolling sales in the second quarter and the first royalties from the collaboration and licensing agreement in China.Business trends(€M) H1 2024 H1 2023 Change Tolling Sales 9.20 9.28 - 0.9 % Package Sales1 1.94 2.52 - 23.0 % Half-year sales 11.13 11.80 - 5.6 % Licensing & Royalties 2.00 - n.a. Total revenues 13.13 11.80 + 11.3 %Tolling services: sales rebound in Q2Despite a highly uncertain macroeconomic environment and increased competition in Europe  tolling sales rebounded by 13.5% in the second quarter of 2024 compared with the second quarter of 2023  mainly due to the delivery of a major order for a rolling mill. Half-year sales remained stable at €9.2m  representing 82.6% of total sales  compared with 78.7% in the first half of 2023. After a long period of destocking in the distribution chain  tolling sales are expected to continue to recover against a backdrop of rising aluminium prices  prompting distributors to restock.Package sales: cyclical slowdown in demand in EuropeAfter a sharp fall in the first quarter  package sales rose by 11% in the second quarter of 2024 against a more favourable comparative base. Half-year sales were €1.9m  down 23.0% year-on-year  representing 17.4% of total sales  compared with 21.3% the previous year. This decline was mainly due to the slowdown in demand in Europe in a difficult environment.Other revenue: first royalties from the collaboration and licensing agreement in ChinaIn February 2024  the Company entered into a collaboration agreement with a Chinese company to leverage its advanced technology in the People's Republic of China and Eastern Asia. Licensing revenues from this agreement generated €2.0m in royalties in the first half of 2024. The Company anticipates further milestone payments and a steady flow of royalties to strengthen its development financing. This agreement is expected to generate up to €4m in revenue during 2024 and 2025.OutlookThe Company aims to replicate its success in continuous anodising within the high-demand Asian market  with a tailored  competitive  and value-driven business model. In Europe  the Company remains cautious due to ongoing macroeconomic challenges and volatile demand. Its flexible industrial resources will enable it to react quickly to any sustained improvement in demand.By leveraging its technological and commercial assets and diversifying its positions in mature and emerging markets  the Company is confident in its development prospects  capitalising on its broad portfolio of premium  sustainable products with a smaller carbon footprint to boost its business potential.Agenda31 October 2024 First half 2024 results and half-year financial report (after close of trading)About COILCOIL is the world's leading anodiser in the building and industrial sectors and trades under the ALOXIDE brand name.Anodising is an electrochemical process (electrolysis) which develops a natural  protective oxide layer on the surface of aluminium and can be coloured in a range of UV-proof finishes. It gives the metal excellent resistance to corrosion and/or reinforces its functional qualities. Anodising preserves all the natural and ecological properties of aluminium; it retains its high rigidity and excellent strength-to-weight ratio  its non-magnetic properties  its exceptional resistance to corrosion. The metal remains totally and repeatedly recyclable through simple re-melting. Anodised aluminium is used in a wide variety of industries and applications: architecture  design  manufacturing  and the automotive sector.COIL deploys an industrial model that creates value by leveraging its unique know-how  its operational excellence  the quality of its investments and the expertise of its people.

Furthermore  Canal+  depending on the success of its public tender offer for MultiChoice  could be subject to a secondary listing on the Johannesburg stock market; Havas  with the majority of its activities being carried out internationally  would be listed as a Dutch public limited liability company (NV) on the Euronext Amsterdam stock exchange. A Dutch legal foundation would guarantee the preservation of the group’s independence and identity. Multiple voting rights would be offered to long-term committed shareholders  taking into account the length of time the Vivendi shares were held for the double voting rights. Havas NV would be subject to Dutch stock market regulations and adhere to the Dutch Corporate Governance Code; A newly named company  Louis Hachette Group   would bring the assets owned by Vivendi in publishing and distribution  i.e.  the Group’s 63.5% shareholding today in Lagardère SA and 100% of Prisma Media . This company would be listed on Euronext Growth in Paris; Vivendi would remain a leading player within the creative and entertainment industries  listed on the regulated market of Euronext Paris market .In parallel  tax issues related to this project are still being studied. The procedures for informing and consulting the employee representative bodies of the concerned group entities will now be initiated. If this project were to proceed following these procedures  a decision could be taken at the end of October 2024 with the aim of submitting it to an Extraordinary Shareholders’ Meeting which could be held in December 2024. This project will require approval by a two-thirds majority of the shareholders.If approved by the Extraordinary Shareholders’ Meeting  the allocation of the shares in the various companies concerned to Vivendi’s shareholders and their listing on the stock market  are expected to take place in the days following the holding of this Shareholders’ Meeting.Interim dividendBolloré’s Board of Directors has decided to pay an interim dividend of 0.02 euro per share  the same as last year  payable in cash only.The ex-interim dividend date will be September 03  2024  with payment on September 05  2024.Consolidated key figures for Bolloré(in millions of euros) 1st half of the year 2024 1st half of 2023 Variation Revenue 10 592 6 231 70% EBITDA (1) 898 615 46% Amortization and provisions (279) (153) Adjusted operating income (EBITA (1)) 619 462 34% Amortization resulting from PPAs and restatement of concessions and the like under IFRS 16 and others (1)(2) (275) (110) EBIT 345 352 (2%) of which operating companies accounted for using the equity method (3) 97 98 Financial income 51 (8) Share in net income of non-operating companies accounted for using the equity method (49) (41) Tax (137) (139) Net income from discontinued operations and assets held for sale 3 675 71 Net income 3 884 235 Net income Group share 3 758 114 Minority interests 126 120 June 30  2024 December 31  2023 Variation Equity 39 953 36 406 3 547 Of which Group share 26 110 23 075 3 035 Net debt Group / (Cash) (2 156) 1 465 (3 621) Gearing (4) n.a. 4%(1) See glossary.(2) Including -95 million euros settlement with Vivendi institutional investors.(3) Including  for the 1st half of 2024  the contribution from UMG accounted for using the equity method (+35 million euros at Vivendi and +63 million euros at Bolloré) versus  for the 1st half of 2023  the contribution from UMG (+25.5 million euros at Vivendi and +45.6 million euros at Bolloré) and the contribution from Lagardère accounted for using the equity method (26 million euros at Vivendi).(4) Gearing: net debt/equity ratioChange in revenue by activity(in millions of euros) 1st half of 2024 1st half of 2023 Published Organic growth growth Bolloré Energy 1 316 1 354 (3%) (6%) Communications (Vivendi) 9 051 4 696 93% 6% Industry 178 148 21% 21% Other (Agricultural assets  Holding companies and others) 46 33 39% 13% Total 10 592 6 231 70% 4%Change in revenue by quarter(in millions of euros) 1st quarter 2nd quarter 2024 2023organic 2023 2024 2023organic 2023Bolloré Energy 655 740 712 661 664 641 Communications (Vivendi) 4 274 4 055 2 290 4 778 4 502 2 407 Industry 75 74 74 104 74 74 Other (Agricultural assets  Holding companies and others) 20 17 15 26 24 18 Total 5 024 4 886 3 091 5 568 5 263 3 140Adjusted operating income by activity (EBITA)(in millions of euros) 1st half of 2024 1st half of 2023 Publishedgrowth Organicgrowth Bolloré Energy (1) 18 22 (20%) (20%) Communications 707 514 37% 15% Vivendi (2) 619 444 39% 14% UMG (consolidated using the equity method Bolloré 18%) 88 70 26% 25% Industry (1) (70) (53) (32%) (31%) Other (Agricultural assets  Holding companies and others) (36) (21) (68%) (68%) EBITA Bolloré Group 619 462 34% 10%All amounts are expressed in millions of euros and rounded to the nearest decimal.(1) Before group costs.(2) Including the contribution of UMG (48 million euros in the first half of 2024 and 39 million euros in the first half of 2023) accounted for by the equity method at Vivendi.A detailed presentation of the income is available on www.bollore.com.The limited review procedures for the 2024 interim consolidated financial statements have been performed and the certification report will be issued after verification of the interim management report.Comparability of financial statementsIn accordance with IFRS 5  and to ensure comparability of income  the reclassification as discontinued operations and assets held for sale concerns Bolloré Logistics for the 2023 and 2024 fiscal years (sold on February 29  2024) and Editis for the 2023 fiscal year (sold on November 14  2023);5  and to ensure comparability of income  the reclassification as discontinued operations and assets held for sale concerns Bolloré Logistics for the 2023 and 2024 fiscal years (sold on February 29  2024) and Editis for the 2023 fiscal year (sold on November 14  2023); Performance indicators At June 30  2024  the Bolloré Group has not changed the definition of its performance indicators  particularly EBITA  which are comparable to those at June 30  2023.

The Company also provided a status update on the COMFORT (Characterization of the Optimal Management of FOod allergy Relief and Treatment) Toddlers supplemental safety study in 1 – 3-year-olds with peanut allergy. DBV reported financial results for the second quarter and the first half of 2024. The quarterly and half-year financial statements were approved by the Board of Directors on July 30  2024.Business UpdateVITESSEDBV Technologies reports that enrollment for the VITESSE Phase 3 pivotal study in children 4 - 7-year-olds with a peanut allergy continues to be on track to screen the last subject by the end of Q3 2024. VITESSE is a trial evaluating efficacy and safety of the modified Viaskin® Peanut patch in approximately 600 subjects (randomized 2:1) with 86 participating sites in US  Canada  Europe  UK and Australia.“We are pleased that sites in the U.S.  Canada  Europe  Australia  and the UK are working hard to continue screening and enrolling subjects so that we are on-track to reach our goal of last subject into VITESSE by the end of Q3 2024 ” said Pharis Mohideen  M.D. Chief Medical Officer at DBV Technologies. “We are seeing great momentum via our engagements at medical conferences and through our outreach efforts via the patient advocacy community and with study investigators. I look forward to the completion of study recruitment in the months to come.”COMFORT ToddlersDBV Technologies and the FDA have been engaged in ongoing dialogue since May 2023 on the COMFORT Toddlers supplemental safety study in 1 – 3-year-olds with a peanut allergy. The study protocol was submitted on November 9  2023  with comments provided by FDA on March 11  2024. Since March  much of the dialogue between DBV and FDA regarding the COMFORT Toddlers supplemental study has focused on patch wear-time experience  including how prescribers would advise parents and caregivers to manage day-to-day variability in patch wear time.In this context  DBV proposed an approach  informed by the EPITOPE efficacy data  that focuses on the user experience during the first 90-days of treatment. DBV submitted to the FDA draft labeling for Section 2 – Dosing and Administration  for a potential Viaskin Peanut Prescribing Information (PI)  along with comprehensive supportive data and analyses. Within the first 90-days of treatment (excluding the lead-in dosing period) it is possible to identify those patients who are very likely to have a robust clinical efficacy response based on patch wear time experience (i.e.  “Label-in” patients). The proposed PI recommends continuation of treatment for these patients. With the same 90-day approach  patients less likely to have a robust clinical efficacy response  identified by their patch wear-time experience  would be identified as “Label-out” patients. In these instances  the PI would recommend a shared decision-making process  between the health care provider and the parent or caregiver  to determine whether treatment should be discontinued.Importantly  the data shows that the “Label-in” and “Label-out” populations have similar immunological characteristics at baseline and have a similar safety profile while on treatment. However  there is clearly a difference in immune physiology (i.e.  local application site sensitivity to the allergen  peanut protein) which impacts an individual patient’s wear time experience.“DBV is and always has been dedicated to families in the food allergy community—our future patients are our top priority ” said Daniel Tasse  Chief Executive Officer of DBV Technologies. “We have offered a robust proposal to the FDA with the goal of expediting and finalizing a path forward for Viaskin Peanut in 1–3-year-olds. We believe the proposed labeling solution  which identifies patients to label-in and label-out of treatment with the Viaskin Peanut patch  will provide data-driven instructions to prescribers  and thus optimize Viaskin Peanut treatment for toddlers suffering from peanut allergy.“On April 29th  the FDA Office of Vaccine Research and Review stated that non-COVID related backlogs were behind them  that the Division was caught-up  allowing more time for interactions with sponsors. We have indeed seen more engagement from FDA  particularly on CMC and our clinical program. DBV looks forward to continued dialogue with FDA in advancing a regulatory pathway for Viaskin Peanut in 1–3-year-olds.”DBV is currently awaiting FDA’s response to the proposed labeling approach which was submitted on June 28th.Conference CallDBV will host a conference call and live audio webcast on Tuesday  July 30th  at 5:30 p.m. ET to review its second quarter 2024 financial results and provide a business update.Participants may access this call via the below teleconferencing numbers and asking to join the DBV Technologies call:United States: +1-877-346-6112International: +1-848-280-6350A live webcast of the call will be available on the Investors & Media section of the Company’s website: https://www.dbv-technologies.com/investor-relations/. A replay of the presentation will also be available on DBV’s website after the event.Financial Highlights for the second quarter Ended June 30  2024The Company’s interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the six months ended June 30  2024  are prepared in accordance with accounting principles in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”).Cash and Cash EquivalentsIn millions of USD(unaudited)U.S. GAAP IFRS six months endedJune 30  six months endedJune 30  2024 2023 2024 2023 Net cash & cash equivalents at the beginning of the period 141.4 209.2 141.4 209.2 Net cash flow used in operating activities (69.8) (46.4) (68.7) (45.4) Net cash flow provided by / (used in) investing activities (1.4) (0.3) (1.4) (0.3) Net cash flow provided by / (used in) financing activities (0.1) 7.8 (1.2) 6.8 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash & cash equivalents (3.9) 3.7 (3.9) 3.7 Net cash & cash equivalents at the end of the period 66.2 174.0 66.2 174.0Cash and cash equivalents amounted to $66.2 million as of June 30  2024  compared to $141.4 million as of December 31  2023  a net decrease by $75.2 million including $69.8 million of net cash flow used in operating activities  mainly external clinical-related expenses notably progress on patient enrollment in the VITESSE Phase 3 clinical trial.The Company has incurred operating losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception. As of July 30th  DBV’s available cash and cash equivalents are not projected to be sufficient to support the Company’s operating plan for at least the next 12 months. As such  there is substantial doubt regarding its ability to continue as a going concern.Based on its current operations  plans and assumptions  the Company expects that its balance of cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund its operations into Q1 2025 due to the implementation of cost-savings measures.The Company intends to seek additional capital as it continues research and development efforts and prepares for the launch of Viaskin Peanut  if approved.The Company cannot guarantee that it will be able to obtain the necessary financing to meet its needs or to obtain funds at attractive terms and conditions  including as a result of disruptions to the global financial markets due to any future pandemics  epidemics or global health crises and conflict in Ukraine or other global political or military crises. A severe or prolonged economic downturn could result in a variety of risks to the Company  including reduced ability to raise additional capital when needed or on acceptable terms  if at all.If the Company is not successful in its financing objectives  the Company could have to scale back its operations  notably by delaying or reducing the scope of its research and development efforts or obtain financing through arrangements with collaborators or others that may require the Company to relinquish rights to its product candidates that the Company might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize independently.This interim condensed financial information does not include any adjustments to the carrying amounts and classification of assets  liabilities  and reported expenses that may be necessary if the Company was unable to continue as a going concern.Operating IncomeIn millions of USD(unaudited)U.S. GAAP U.S. GAAP IFRS six monthsended June 30  three months ended June 30  six months ended June 30  2024 2023 2024 2023 2024 2023 Research tax credits 2.6 3.7 1.2 2.0 2.6 3.7 Other operating income — 0.7 — 0.3 — 0.8 Operating income 2.6 4.5 1.2 2.3 2.6 4.5Operating income amounted to $2.6 million for the 6 months ended June 30  2024  compared with $4.5 million for the same period in 2023.

DBV is currently focused on investigating the use of its proprietary technology platform  Viaskin  to address food allergies  which are caused by a hypersensitive immune reaction and characterized by a range of symptoms varying in severity from mild to life-threatening anaphylaxis. Millions of people live with food allergies  including young children. Through epicutaneous immunotherapy (EPIT™)  the Viaskin platform is designed to introduce microgram amounts of a biologically active compound to the immune system through intact skin. EPIT is a new class of non-invasive treatment that seeks to modify an individual’s underlying allergy by re-educating the immune system to become desensitized to allergen by leveraging the skin’s immune tolerizing properties. DBV is committed to transforming the care of food allergic people. The Company’s food allergy programs include ongoing clinical trials of Viaskin Peanut in peanut allergic toddlers (1 through 3 years of age) and children (4 through 7 years of age).DBV Technologies is headquartered in Châtillon  France  with North American operations in Warren  NJ. The Company’s ordinary shares are traded on segment B of Euronext Paris (Ticker: DBV  ISIN code: FR0010417345) and the Company’s ADSs (each representing one ordinary share) are traded on the Nasdaq Capital Select Market (Ticker: DBVT).For more information  please visit www.dbv-technologies.com and engage with us on X (formerly Twitter) and LinkedIn.Forward Looking StatementsThis press release may contain forward-looking statements and estimates  including statements regarding DBV’s financial condition  forecast of its cash runway  the therapeutic potential of Viaskin® Peanut patch and EPIT™  designs of DBV’s anticipated clinical trials  DBV’s planned regulatory and clinical efforts including timing and results of communications with regulatory agencies  the ability of any of DBV’s product candidates  if approved  to improve the lives of patients with food allergies.

Cables accounted for approximately 15% of the Group's sales and copper accounts for approximately 60% of the composition of cables. This exposure is indirect since cable prices also reflect copper suppliers' commercial policies and the competitive environment in the Group's markets. Changes in copper prices have an estimated so-called ""recurring"" effect and an estimated so called ""non-recurring"" effect on the Group's performance assessed as part of the monthly internal reporting process of the Rexel Group: i) the recurring effect related to the change in copper-based cable prices corresponds to the change in value of the copper part included in the sales price of cables from one period to another. This effect mainly relates to the Group’s sales; ii) the non-recurring effect related to the change in copper-based cable prices corresponds to the effect of copper price variations on the sales price of cables between the time they are purchased and the time they are sold  until all such inventory has been sold (direct effect on gross profit). Practically  the non-recurring effect on gross profit is determined by comparing the historical purchase price for copper-based cable and the supplier price effective at the date of the sale of the cables by the Rexel Group. Additionally  the non-recurring effect on EBITA corresponds to the non-recurring effect on gross profit  which may be offset  when appropriate  by the non-recurring portion of changes in the distribution and administrative expenses.The impact of these two effects is assessed for as much of the Group’s total cable sales as possible  over each period. Group procedures require that entities that do not have the information systems capable of such exhaustive calculations to estimate these effects based on a sample representing at least 70% of the sales in the period. The results are then extrapolated to all cables sold during the period for that entity. Considering the sales covered. the Rexel Group considers such estimates of the impact of the two effects to be reasonable.This document may contain statements of future expectations and other forward-looking statements.

The year-on-year improvement by c. +260 basis points resulted from the translation of revenue growth helped by price increase related to inflation indexation of contracts  a positive mix effect and  to further operational efficiencies on employee-related costs and the internalization of outsourced services.Current operating profit reached € 23.4 million in H1 2024  up by +27.0% compared to H1 2023 and Profit for the period amounted to € 16.0 million  down -14.4% compared to H1 2023  impacted by IPO costs.Cash generation was strong in H1 2024  with adjusted FCF* reaching € 36.9 million  up by +13.6% year-on-year. It represented a cash conversion rate* of 127.2%  above the projected level for the year of c. 80% but in line with the usual seasonality in H1 due to SaaS solutions cash collection at the beginning of the year. Net cash position* (excluding lease liabilities) was € 156.4 million as of June 30  2024  compared to € 142.6 million as of December 31  2023 and € 149.4 million as of June 30  2023.Loïc Sautour  CEO of Planisware  commented: ”In the first half of 2024  Planisware continued to play its key role as the accelerator of the Project Economy and to deliver on its consistent track record of strong growth and profitability at scale  progressing in its ambition to be the number one provider of multi-specialty project and portfolio management software solutions.We demonstrated this over the semester with a sustained revenue growth  led in particular by the strong growth of our SaaS operations. Our commercial pipeline reached record high levels in a context of still longer customers' decision-making process  primarily for new logos.Helped by the strong recurrence of our revenue profile and our confidence in the delivery by year end of delayed projects  we confirm our 2024 objective of approximately 19.5% revenue growth in constant currencies revenue  as well as profitability and cash conversion guidance for 2024.“Reaching €86.6 million in H1 2024  revenue was up by +19.3% in current currencies and +19.6% in constant currencies. The exchange rates effect was mostly related to the appreciation of the euro versus the US dollar and the Japanese yen compared to H1 2023. In order to reflect the underlying performance of the Company independently from exchange rates fluctuations  the following analysis refers to revenue evolution in constant currencies  applying H1 2023 average exchange rates to H1 2024 revenue figures  unless expressly stated otherwise.H1 2024 revenue by revenue streamIn € million H1 2024 H1 2023 VariationYoY Variationin cc* Recurring revenue 76.6 62.1 +23.5% +23.8% SaaS & Hosting 38.8 29.6 +31.2% +31.3% Evolutive support 22.9 19.4 +18.2% +18.8% Subscription support 5.6 4.1 +37.7% +37.5% Maintenance 9.3 9.0 +3.2% +3.2% Non-recurring revenue 10.0 10.1 -1.3% -1.4% Perpetual license 4.1 2.3 +77.3% +77.3% Implementation & others non-recurring 5.9 7.8 -24.6% -24.6% Revenue with customers 86.6 72.2 +20.0% +20.2% Other revenue - 0.4 Total revenue 86.6 72.6 +19.3% +19.6%* Revenue evolution in constant currencies  i.e. at H1 2023 average exchange ratesRecurring revenueRepresenting 88% of revenue  recurring revenue reached €76.6 million in H1 2024  up by +23.8%.This strong growth was fully led by Planisware’s SaaS model (i.e. SaaS & Hosting and Evolutive & Subscription support) with SaaS & Hosting revenue up by +31.3% in H1 2024 thanks to contracts secured with new customers as well as continued expansion within the installed base. Evolutive support and Subscription support revenues  intrinsically related to Planisware’s SaaS offering  together grew by +22.1%.Maintenance revenue was slightly up (+3.2%)  reflecting the Group’s shift from its prior license model to a SaaS model.Non-recurring revenueNon-recurring revenue was broadly stable in H1 (-1.4%)  helped by additional perpetual licenses sold in Q2 2024  mostly to established customers and to a lesser extent to new logos with specific on-premise needs.The good performance of Perpertual license was driven by the sale of license extensions to existing clients. The revenue decrease in implementation services was due to the combined effect of delays in the start of projects in the beginning of 2024 and a high comparison basis with a significant number of implementations delivered in H1 2023.H1 2024 revenue by regionIn € million H1 2024 H1 2023 VariationYoY Variationin cc* Europe 41.9 35.4 +18.3% +18.1% North America 37.6 32.5 +15.6% +15.6% APAC & ROW 7.1 4.3 +68.0% +73.3% Revenue with customers 86.6 72.2 +20.0% +20.2% Other revenue - 0.4 Total revenue 86.6 72.6 +19.3% +19.6%* Revenue evolution in constant currencies  i.e. at H1 2023 average exchange ratesOver the first part of the year  Planisware continued to grow operations in its key geographies. In Europe  revenue grew by +18.1% driven by strong dynamics in Germany.Representing 43% of H1 2024 revenue  North America faced elongated customers' decision-making processes  primarily for new logos  leading to delays of some implementation projects and translating into slower growth in non-recurring activities and Implementation services in particular. This was partly compensated by a significant level of cross-selling and up-selling with existing customers and new customer wins in US SaaS operations. As a result  North America grew by +15.6% over the semester.Planisware’s growth in APAC & rest of the world of +73.3% year-on year resulted from a strong commercial momentum in Japan  Singapore  and the Middle-East  as well as from the consolidation of IFT KK as from June 2023 and  to a lesser extent  of Planisware MIS as from October 2023.H1 2024 revenue by pillarIn € million H1 2024 H1 2023 VariationYoY Variationin cc* Product Development & Innovation 48.3 40.4 +19.5% +20.0% Project Controls & Engineering 16.0 13.4 +19.2% +19.2% Agility & IT Project Portfolios 15.6 12.2 +27.3% +27.3% Project Business Automation 6.6 6.0 +10.4% +10.2% Others 0.2 0.2 +2.6% +2.6% Revenue with customers 86.6 72.2 +20.0% +20.2% Other revenue - 0.4 Total revenue 86.6 72.6 +19.3% +19.6%* Revenue evolution in constant currencies  i.e. at H1 2023 average exchange ratesProduct Development & Innovation (“PD&I”) drives R&D and product development teams with a focus on companies in the life sciences  manufacturing and engineering  automotive design and fast-moving consumer goods sectors.

As a percentage of revenue  cost of sales decreased by -320 basis points thanks to a continued strict monitoring of costs  in particular with respect to recruitment and the internalization of outsourced services.This enabled Planisware to deliver a € 61.7 million gross profit (+25.0% year-on-year)  representing a 71.3% gross margin  a significant improvement of c. +320 basis points compared to 68.0% in H1 2023.Operating profit and profit for the periodR&D expenses  consisting primarily of staff expenses directly associated with R&D teams  as well as amortization of capitalized development costs and the benefits from the French research tax credit  represented 12% of revenue and reached € 10.8 million. Planisware intends to maintain a high level of R&D spending  as it believes that its ability to provide innovative products and software solutions  expand its offerings portfolio and promote its offerings in the project management market will have a considerable effect on its revenues and results of operations in the future.Reaching € 15.5 million in H1 2024 (18% of revenue)  Sales & marketing expenses increased by €+2.5 million  or +19.1%  compared to € 13.0 million in H1 2023  led in particular by the increase in employee-related costs in the salesforce and marketing team. Sales & marketing expenses are expected to increase in absolute amounts in the future as Planisware plans on expanding its domestic and international selling and marketing activities in order to strengthen its leading market position.Representing 14% of revenue in H1 2024  General & administrative expenses reached € 12.0 million (€+1.7 million  or +16.6% compared to € 10.3 million in H1 2023). This increase was mostly related to employee costs engaged to support the growth of the business  the strengthening of global support functions  and the international expansion of the Group. Planisware expects that  as the Company continues to scale up in the future  General & administrative expenses will slightly decrease as a percentage of revenue.As a result  current operating profit reached € 23.4 million in H1 2024  up by +27.0% compared to H1 2023.Other operating income & expenses amounted to a net expense of € 5.8 million related to IPO costs.As a results of the above  operating profit reached € 17.7 million in H1 2024  down by -21.5% (or €-4.8 million)  compared to € 22.5 million in H1 2023.Reaching € 1.9 million in H1 2024  financial income significantly improved compared to a loss of € 0.2 million in H1 2023. This was primarily driven by income from time deposits and realized and unrealized gains on marketable securities as well as foreign exchange gains and losses arising from the revaluation at closing rates of cash and cash equivalents held in foreign currencies.Income tax expense amounted to € 3.6 million in H1 2024  down by -2.3% compared to € 3.7 million in H1 2023.As a result of these evolutions  profit for the period reached € 16.0 million in H1 2024  down by -14.4% (€-2.7 million) compared to H1 2023.Adjusted EBITDAAdjusted EBITDA  which Planisware considers to be a meaningful financial measure to assess and compare the Group’s profitability  reached € 29.0 million  a strong increase compared to H1 2023 (€+6.6 million  or +29.3%). It represented 33.5% of H1 2024 revenue  c. +260 basis points compared to 30.9% in H1 2023. The increase of adjusted EBITDA reflects the translation of revenue growth into profit as the business is fueled by the addition of new customers  a positive mix effect and further operational efficiencies on employee-related costs and the internalization of outsourced services.Cash generation and net cash positionChange in working capital was €+13.7 million  in line with the usual seasonality as most of Planisware’s customers prepay for solutions at the beginning of the year  which generates structurally negative working capital requirements and slight positive change in working capital expected every year. This is to be compared to €+17.2 million in H1 2023 that was also helped by a significant catch-up in collecting overdue invoices. Capital expenditures totaled € 2.1 million  representing 2.4% of revenue  compared to € 2.5 million in H1 2023 (3.5% of revenue). The lower capex level than usually observed is mostly due to a purchase order for servers made in early July while expected earlier and not questioning the usual c. 3% level targeted over the year. Finally  tax paid in H1 2024 was € 4.1 million compared to € 3.8 million in H1 2023.In H1 2024  adjusted Free Cash Flow reached € 36.9 million  up by +13.6% compared to € 32.5 million in H1 2023  mostly due to the growth of Adjusted EBITDA. It represented a Cash Conversion Rate of 127.2%  above the 80% level that the Group considers being the normative Cash Conversion Rate for the coming years but in line with the usual seasonality as most of its customers prepay for solutions at the beginning of the year.As of June 30  2024  except lease liabilities related to offices and datacenter facilities which amounted to € 14.0 million (€ 14.9 million as of December 31  2023 and € 14.6 million as of June 30  2023) and small amounts of bank overdrafts  Planisware did not have any financial debt. As a result  the Group’s net cash position* as of June 30  2024 amounted to € 156.4 million as of June 30  2024 compared to € 142.6 million as of December 31  2023 and € 149.4 million as of June 30  2023.2024 objectives confirmedSupported by the H1 2024 performance overall in line with the trajectory expected for the year  the strong recurrence of its revenue profile and its confidence in the delivery of delayed projects by year end  Planisware confirms all its 2024 objectives:c. 19.5% revenue growth in constant currenciesAdjusted EBITDA margin of approximately 33%Cash Conversion Rate of c.80%AppendicesQ2 2024 revenue by revenue streamIn € million Q2 2024 Q2 2023 VariationYoY Variationin cc* Recurring revenue 39.5 32.3 +22.1% +21.5% SaaS & Hosting 19.9 15.2 +31.0% +30.3% Evolutive support 12.1 10.7 +12.7% +12.5% Subscription support 2.8 2.0 +38.3% +36.8% Maintenance 4.7 4.4 +6.6% +6.2% Non-recurring revenue 6.2 5.5 +12.8% +12.4% Perpetual license 3.0 1.5 +98.5% +98.0% Implementation & others non-recurring 3.2 4.0 -19.2% -19.6% Revenue with customers 45.7 37.9 +20.7% +20.2% Other revenue - 0.2 Total revenue 45.7 38.1 +20.1% +19.5%* Revenue evolution in constant currencies  i.e. at H1 2023 average exchange ratesNon-IFRS measures reconciliationsIn € million H1 2024 H1 2023 Current operating profit after share of profit of equity-accounted investee 23.4 18.8 Depreciation and amortization of intangible  tangible and right-of-use assets 3.5 3.3 Share-based payments 2.1 0.3 Adjusted EBITDA* 29.0 22.4In € million H1 2024 H1 2023 Net cash from operating activities 35.2 33.2 Capital expenditures -2.1 -2.5 Other finance income/costs -1.8 0.2 IPO costs paid 5.6 1.7 Adjusted Free Cash Flow* 36.9 32.5* Non-IFRS measure.

California reported fewer new cases and fatalities than its 14-day rolling average  according to the health department's website. Photographer: Bing Guan/Bloomberg(Bloomberg) -- Fidelidade-Companhia de Seguros SA  an insurer controlled by Fosun International Ltd. of China  is evaluating a possible new attempt at doing an initial public offering of its Portuguese hospital operator unit Luz Saude.“We’re now assessing market conditions to see if it makes sense to  in a few months  go back to the market with a potential IPO ” Fidelidade Chief Executive Officer Rogerio Campos Henriques said in an interview in Lisbon. “We’re talking frequently to banks  to advisers that come to us and basically give us their perspective of what they think is best.”Fidelidade suspended a plan to carry out the IPO of the Luz Saude unit in April  citing instability in capital markets. The offering would have been Portugal’s first IPO in three years  and the Lisbon exchange is still waiting for a new stock listing.In April  Fidelidade was seeking a valuation of at least €1 billion ($1.1 billion) for Luz Saude.“The major issue why we didn’t move forward with the IPO was clearly valuation ” Henriques said. “During that week we heard things like discounts of over 30%. Luz Saude is a trophy asset. So it deserves a proper valuation.”The CEO said a decision on a possible IPO of Luz Saude is unlikely to take place before 2025. He also didn’t rule out a possible direct sale of a minority stake in the unit  whose 29 hospitals  clinics and nursing homes make it one of Portugal’s biggest private health-care providers.“It’s not completely off the table to consider a private sale  but it would have to be with a very good valuation ” said Henriques  52. “We would always prefer an IPO because it provides more visibility to the asset.”Fidelidade IPOLuz Saude was delisted from the Euronext Lisbon exchange in 2018 after China’s Fosun bought most of the shares  through Fidelidade.In April  Portugal’s biggest insurer said it was also planning an IPO of Fidelidade shares.“We believe there will be lots of interested investors in Fidelidade and we’re preparing the company for this challenge ” Henriques said. “There is no date. It will be in the next few years for sure.”Fosun holds an 85% stake in Lisbon-based Fidelidade while Portuguese state-owned bank Caixa Geral de Depositos SA owns the remaining 15%.In Portugal  Fosun also holds a 20% stake in Banco Comercial Portugues SA  the country’s biggest publicly-traded lender. The Chinese company has been carrying out some asset sales and in January sold a 5.6% holding in that bank.New MarketsSince Fosun took control of Fidelidade in 2014  the insurer increased its market share in Portugal to about 30%. Fidelidade also expanded in Latin America by setting up new operations in Chile and acquiring an insurance company in Peru.Fidelidade  which is present in 13 countries worldwide  is currently looking for acquisition opportunities in Mexico  Colombia and Panama  Henriques said.The CEO declined to give details about the timing and size of possible acquisitions in Latin America. The region accounted for 60% of Fidelidade’s international business in 2023  according to the company’s website.“The objective is to continue growing on the international front ” said Henriques  adding that Fidelidade is like a “big fish in a small pond” in Portugal. “Our priority right now is Latin America.”©2024 Bloomberg L.P.,neutral,0.05,0.95,0.01,negative,0.0,0.27,0.73,True,English,"['New Attempt', 'Hospital Operator', 'Fosun', 'Fidelidade', 'IPO', 'Fidelidade Chief Executive Officer Rogerio Campos Henriques', 'Caixa Geral de Depositos SA', 'Fidelidade-Companhia de Seguros SA', 'Banco Comercial Portugues SA', 'Portuguese hospital operator unit', 'biggest private health-care providers', 'Sharp Memorial Hospital', '14-day rolling average', 'fewer new cases', 'new stock listing', 'Fidelidade IPO Luz Saude', 'Portuguese state-owned bank', 'possible new attempt', 'initial public offering', 'possible direct sale', '2024 Bloomberg L.P.', 'Luz Saude unit', 'Euronext Lisbon exchange', 'Fosun International Ltd', 'private sale', 'New Markets', 'new operations', 'possible acquisitions', 'international business', 'international front', 'possible IPO', 'empty bed', 'emergency department', 'San Diego', 'U.S.', 'health department', 'Bing Guan/Bloomberg', 'capital markets', 'major issue', 'nursing homes', 'interested investors', 'Latin America', 'acquisition opportunities', 'big fish', 'small pond', 'Lisbon-based Fidelidade', 'potential IPO', 'first IPO', 'market conditions', 'trophy asset', 'biggest insurer', 'asset sales', 'market share', 'three years', 'proper valuation', 'good valuation', 'Chinese company', 'insurance company', 'Fidelidade shares', 'minority stake', '85% stake', '20% stake', 'room', 'California', 'Thursday', 'Jan.', 'fatalities', 'website', 'Photographer', 'China', 'sense', 'months', 'interview', 'banks', 'advisers', 'perspective', 'plan', 'April', 'instability', 'Portugal', 'week', 'things', 'discounts', 'CEO', 'decision', 'place', '29 hospitals', 'clinics', 'table', 'visibility', 'lots', 'challenge', 'date', 'country', 'lender', 'January', '5.6% holding', 'control', 'Chile', 'Peru', '13 countries', 'Mexico', 'Colombia', 'Panama', 'details', 'timing', 'size', 'region', 'objective', 'priority']",2024-07-31,2024-07-31,bnnbloomberg.ca
