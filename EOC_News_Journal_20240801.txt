Fitch moved the country from a CC rating to C after they reached an agreement  at least in principle  with fore…,Ukraine’s credit rating downgraded again by Fitch over $20 billion debt restructuringThe credit rating agency Fitch has downgraded Ukraine’s credit rating as the conflict with Russia continues  cautioning that a default is imminent. Fitch moved the country from a CC rating to C after they reached an agreement  at least in principle  with foreign investors for restructuring their $20 billion debt on Monday.Last week  Ukraine’s parliament approved legislation that will allow the government to suspend debt payments for a period of three months and go into debt default during the negotiations for the restructuring agreement.The deal will see some of the top global investment funds  such as Amundi and BlackRock  writing off a significant portion of the nearly $24 billion in claims by exchanging current bonds for newer ones that will last for up to 12 years. They will be structured to defer much of the payments that Ukraine would have had to pay in the coming years  reducing what they must repay by 2033 by 75%.In a statement  Ukraine’s finance ministry noted: “The deal will result in net savings on debt servicing of $11.4 billion over the next 3 years and $22.75 billion until 2033. This will free up vital financial resources  which can be redirected towards defense and social spending.”The agreement came shortly before Ukraine's payment freeze on foreign debt payments  which was announced after Russia’s invasion  was set to expire in early August. Defaulting would have created tensions between Ukraine and Western governments  as well as the International Monetary Fund.Fitch stated: “The reported agreement with external commercial creditors constitutes a distressed debt exchange (DDE) under its sovereign rating criteria.”They also noted that Kiev’s defense spending made up more than 31% of the country’s GDP last year. They predict government debt will skyrocket to 92.5% of Ukraine’s GDP this year.Ukraine’s economy has been devastated by its war with Russia  which is now dragging into its 28th month  and it depends heavily on military aid and funding from other countries. It has been spending most of its domestic revenue on its military while using money received from Western countries for expenses such as pensions and public sector salaries.The loss of people  infrastructure and territory is all taking a toll on the war-ravaged country. Its tax base has been dwindling; its registered civilian labor force in 2021 numbered 11.5 million people and now sits at just 9 million.G7 countries working out details of $50 billion loan for UkraineThe G7 nations and the EU reached an agreement in June to use the interest earned on frozen Russian assets to finance a $50 billion loan for Ukraine so it can stay afloat amid the ongoing conflict. Some details still need to be ironed out  however  with the U.S. seeking reassurances from the European Union that the Russian assets it seized will stay frozen until the entire loan has been paid back. Most of the assets are currently being held in the securities depository Euroclear in Belgium.The money is expected to reach Ukraine by the end of the year. They will be able to spend it on areas such as military  reconstruction  economic needs and humanitarian efforts.Sources for this article include:RT.comFitchRatings.com,negative,0.0,0.08,0.92,negative,0.0,0.19,0.81,True,English,"['$20 billion debt restructuring', 'credit rating', 'Ukraine', 'Fitch', 'NaturalNews', 'com', 'top global investment funds', 'vital financial resources', 'International Monetary Fund', 'external commercial creditors', 'public sector salaries', 'civilian labor force', 'sovereign rating criteria', 'distressed debt exchange', 'up to 12 years', 'credit rating agency', 'The G7 nations', '$20 billion debt restructuring', 'foreign debt payments', 'foreign investors', 'G7 countries', 'CC rating', 'debt servicing', 'coming years', 'next 3 years', '$50 billion loan', 'three months', 'significant portion', 'current bonds', 'finance ministry', 'net savings', 'social spending', 'payment freeze', 'early August', 'Western governments', '28th month', 'other countries', 'domestic revenue', 'Western countries', 'tax base', 'U.S.', 'European Union', 'entire loan', 'securities depository', 'economic needs', 'humanitarian efforts', 'debt default', 'government debt', 'restructuring agreement', 'Russian assets', 'defense spending', '11.5 million people', 'ongoing conflict', 'military aid', 'war-ravaged country', 'Ukraine', 'Fitch', 'principle', 'Monday', 'parliament', 'legislation', 'period', 'negotiations', 'deal', 'Amundi', 'BlackRock', 'claims', 'newer', 'statement', 'invasion', 'Defaulting', 'tensions', 'DDE', 'Kiev', 'GDP', 'economy', 'funding', 'money', 'expenses', 'pensions', 'loss', 'infrastructure', 'territory', 'toll', 'details', 'June', 'interest', 'reassurances', 'Euroclear', 'Belgium', 'areas', 'reconstruction', 'article']",2024-07-31,2024-08-01,naturalnews.com

In the first half of 2024  shipments increased by 8.1% to 2.3 million tons (HY1 2023: 2.1 million tons). The increase is primarily attributable to the acquisitions in Mexico and the US completed in the second half of 2023. With €3.5 billion (HY1 2023: €3.6 billion)  sales dropped slightly by 2.6% in the first half of the year due to lower prices.The operating income (EBITDA) before material special effects in the first half of 2024 was €83 million (HY1 2023: €130 million). Despite a persistently challenging macroeconomic environment and a significant steel price correction  Klöckner & Co generated solid EBITDA before material special effects of €42 million in the second quarter of 2024 (Q2 2023: €65 million). Therefore  the figure is within the guidance range of €30 to 70 million. Earnings in the prior-year comparative periods benefited in particular from a more favorable market environment overall.Guido Kerkhoff  CEO of Klöckner & Co SE: “Despite a challenging environment  we achieved a solid result and made further progress in implementing our strategy. With the acquisition of Amerinox Processing in North America  we further expanded our range of higher value-added products and services.”In March 2024  Klöckner & Co successfully completed the disposal of parts of its European distribution business. The net loss from discontinued operations amounted to €5 million in Q2 2024 (Q2 2023 net loss of €3 million) and €29 million in the first half of 2024 (HY1 2023 net loss of €35 million). This result was largely attributable to negative deconsolidation effects. The net loss from continuing operations in the second quarter of 2024 amounted to €18 million (Q2 2023 net income of €15 million) and in the first half of 2024 to €26 million (HY1 2023 net income of €39 million). Overall  the net loss including discontinued operations came to €23 million in the second quarter of 2024 (Q2 2023 net income of €12 million) and €55 million in the first half of 2024 (HY1 2023 net income of €4 million). Earnings per share from continuing operations amounted to €–0.18 in Q2 2024 (Q2 2023: €0.15) and €–0.27 in HY1 2024 (HY1 2023: €0.39). Earnings per share including discontinued operations in the second quarter of 2024 amounted to €–0.23 (Q2 2023: €0.12) and in the first half year of 2024 to €–0.56 (HY1 2023: €0.04).For the second quarter of 2024  Klöckner & Co generated a significantly positive cash flow from operating activities in the amount of €61 million (Q2 2023: €33 million). Cash flow from operating activities for the first six months of fiscal year 2024 was €18 million (HY1 2023: €79 million).With the successful acquisition of Amerinox Processing by the US subsidiary Kloeckner Metals Corporation  Klöckner & Co has further strengthened its leading position in North America. Amerinox Processing processes stainless steel  aluminum and special carbon steel. The company is an industry leader in material polishing  including high-gloss finishing. Amerinox Processing employs roughly 60 people in Camden  New Jersey  near a major port. Klöckner & Co will use this excellent strategic location to build competitive  global supply chains. The Group will also use the acquisition to further expand its range of higher value-added products and services.OutlookThe year-to-date demand has been weaker than originally anticipated  especially in Europe. In light of these developments  Klöckner & Co now expects a slight increase in shipments for fiscal year 2024 compared to the previous year. Due to the steel price correction over the course of the year so far  a slight year-on-year decline in sales is projected for 2024. Despite the persistently challenging macroeconomic environment  the company expects EBITDA before material special effects in the range of €20 million to €60 million in the third quarter of 2024 and €120 million to €180 million for fiscal year 2024. Klöckner & Co continues to anticipate a strong and once again significantly positive cash flow from operating activities in the current fiscal year. However  it will likely remain below previous year’s level.About Klöckner & Co:Klöckner & Co SE is one of the largest producer-independent distributors of steel and metal products and one of the world’s leading steel service center companies. With its distribution and service network of around 120 sites  primarily in North America and the “DACH” region (Germany  Austria and Switzerland)  Klöckner & Co supplies more than 60 000 customers. Currently  the Group has around 6 400 employees. Klöckner & Co generated sales of some €7.0 billion in fiscal year 2023. With the expansion of its portfolio of CO 2 -reduced materials  services and logistics options under the Nexigen® umbrella brand  the Company is underscoring its role as a pioneer of a sustainable steel industry.

(“AMG”  EURONEXT AMSTERDAM: “AMG”) reports second quarter 2024 revenue of $364 million  a 17% decrease versus the second quarter of 2023. Despite significant declines in lithium a…,Amsterdam  31 July 2024 (Regulated Information) --- AMG Critical Materials N.V. (“AMG”  EURONEXT AMSTERDAM: “AMG”) reports second quarter 2024 revenue of $364 million  a 17% decrease versus the second quarter of 2023. Despite significant declines in lithium and vanadium prices compared to the same period in 2023  AMG achieved an adjusted EBITDA of $39 million by leveraging its diversified portfolio. AMG continued to experience robust structural demand for its critical materials which is a testament to the strategic positioning of our businesses and the low-cost position of all of our operations.Dr. Heinz Schimmelbusch  Chairman of the Management Board and CEO  said  “The second quarter 2024 adjusted EBITDA of $39 million reflects the success of our strategic positioning and diversified business model  enabling us to navigate market volatility effectively. Aerospace continues to be a source of growth  with AMG Engineering securing $90 million in order intake in the second quarter  and a June 30th order backlog of $310 million. Additionally  AMG Chrome  AMG Graphite and AMG Antimony all performed well compared to the second quarter last year  and it is noteworthy that every operating unit at AMG was profitable in the second quarter of 2024.In terms of our growth initiatives  our major lithium projects continue on-schedule  with our Brazilian mine expansion and our lithium conversion plant ramp-up in Germany. Both projects strengthen our position in the lithium market. In June 2024  we took an additional step to expand our lithium resource portfolio with the capital investment in Savannah Resources  Europe’s largest spodumene lithium deposit. With current low price levels  AMG has been able to increase its control over lithium resources with minimal capital outlays. Additionally  our low-cost operations in Brazil are delivering continued profitability in lithium concentrate and are ramping up production ahead of schedule.Our vanadium business demonstrated strong volume growth of 23% in the second quarter of 2024 versus the second quarter of last year  helping to offset a 29% decline in price. Our operations in Ohio continue to be the low-cost global producer of ferrovanadium  significantly outperforming primary mining operations.I am also pleased to report that we have significant liquidity to support our many growth opportunities. With $308 million in cash on hand and $200 million available under our revolving credit facility  AMG has a total liquidity of over $500 million.”LithiumAMG Lithium B.V. invested GBP 16 million (approximately USD 20 million) in Savannah Resources Plc  the developer of the Barroso Lithium Project in Portugal  Europe’s largest spodumene lithium deposit. This investment gives AMG a 15.77% ownership stake  making AMG the largest shareholder of record.Our lithium concentrate plant expansion from 90 000 tons to 130 000 tons per year is ramping up and we expect to produce at 110 000-ton annualized capacity in the third quarter and at full 130 000-ton annualized capacity in the fourth quarter.In Bitterfeld  Germany  AMG’s first 20 000-ton module of its lithium hydroxide refinery is on schedule and the qualification process is underway. The production batches are expected to ship in the third quarter of 2024.VanadiumAMG Vanadium’s Zanesville  Ohio facility continued to perform well and exceeded target production volumes in the first half of 2024.AMG Vanadium completed a 5-year contract extension with a key  long-term refinery partner for processing their spent catalyst. AMG Vanadium will continue to provide full metals reclamation on this material  fully eliminating any environmental risks for this refinery.The vanadium electrolyte plant at AMG Titanium in Nuremberg  Germany is in the final stages of completion. We expect to have nameplate capacity available by the fourth quarter of 2024 as part of the vertical integration into LIVA batteries.In May 2024  AMG Titanium signed a new multi-year contract extension with SAFRAN to supply titanium aluminides (“TiAl”) for production of low-pressure turbine blades for the CFM International LEAP engine. The technology and equipment to produce this material was jointly developed with AMG Engineering (ALD Vacuum Technologies).SARBV’s “Supercenter” phase 1 project in Saudi Arabia has completed the FEL3 basic engineering phase. Technical and commercial evaluations of the long lead equipment packages are progressing and expected to be complete by the end of the third quarter of 2024.TechnologiesAMG LIVA is executing several battery projects to optimize energy management for industrial plants and integrate renewable energy sources and EV charging. A hybrid energy storage system with a 4.5 MWh capacity is currently in service  integrating wind and solar energy for a major industrial client and enabling 80% self-sufficiency.AMG Graphit Kropfmühl and BASF have entered into an innovative agreement to reduce their product carbon footprint.Financial HighlightsIn April 2024  AMG entered into a new $100 million incremental term loan  structured as a fungible add-on to the existing $350 million senior secured term loan. The $100 million incremental term loan has the same pricing  terms and 2028 maturity as the existing $350 million term loan. AMG will use the proceeds of the new incremental term loan for general corporate purposes and lithium resource development.AMG’s liquidity as of June 30  2024 was $508 million  with $308 million of unrestricted cash and $200 million of revolving credit availability.AMG declares an interim dividend of €0.20 per ordinary share  to be paid in the third quarter of 2024.Key FiguresIn 000’s US dollars Q2 ‘24 Q2 ‘23 Change Revenue $364 311 $439 319 (17%) Gross profit 55 336 127 534 (57%) Gross margin 15.2% 29.0% Operating profit 10 332 78 167 (87%) Operating margin 2.8% 17.8% Net (loss) income attributable to shareholders (11 002) 42 763 N/A EPS - Fully diluted (0.34) 1.28 N/A EBIT (1) 25 091 93 780 (73%) Adjusted EBITDA (2) 39 495 107 453 (63%) Adjusted EBITDA margin 10.8% 24.5% Cash (used in) from operating activities (9 271) 59 975 N/ANotes:(1) EBIT is defined as earnings before interest and income taxes.

These variances were largely driven by the 59% decline in lithium market prices since the second quarter of 2023  as well as the decreased lithium concentrate volumes as a result of the ramp-up currently underway.SG&A expenses of $11 million in the second quarter of 2024 were 10% higher than in the same period last year  mainly driven by the increase in headcount related to both the German and Brazilian lithium expansion projects  as well as higher employee benefit costs and professional fees.The second quarter 2024 of adjusted EBITDA decreased 98%  to $2 million  from $86 million in the second quarter of 2023  due to the decline in metal prices as noted above.During the second quarter of 2024  a total of 17 092 dry metric tons (“dmt”) of lithium concentrates were sold  41% lower than the 28 870 dmt in the second quarter of 2023 due to the ramp-up currently underway at our lithium concentrate plant. The average realized sales price was $891/dmt CIF China for the quarter. The average cost per ton for the quarter was $543/dmt CIF China. Both total production and cost of production were ahead of plan.Our lithium concentrate plant is currently ramping to 130 000 tons and shipping volumes were therefore impacted in the second quarter. We expect to reach design capacity production in the fourth quarter of 2024. AMG is one of the lowest-cost lithium concentrate mines in the world  and we plan to maintain this competitive advantage.AMG VanadiumQ2 ‘24 Q2 ‘23 Change Revenue $168 022 $180 870 (7%) Gross profit 19 769 17 227 15% Operating profit (loss) 6 003 (3 217) N/A Adjusted EBITDA 19 971 15 693 27%AMG Vanadium’s revenue for the second quarter of 2024 decreased by 7%  to $168 million  due primarily to lower sales prices across the segment  partially offset by increased volumes in vanadium and chrome metal.Gross profit of $20 million in the second quarter of 2024 was 15% higher compared to the same period in 2023  largely due to the increased volumes in vanadium and chrome metal.SG&A expenses in the second quarter of 2024 of $14 million were 32% lower than the second quarter of 2023. The prior period was higher due to a one-time pension expense.The second quarter of 2024 adjusted EBITDA of $20 million was 27% greater than the same period in 2023. This was primarily driven by the increased volumes in vanadium and chrome metal as well as the ongoing benefit of Section 45X  a production credit for domestic manufacturing of critical materials for which AMG Vanadium qualified based on the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.AMG TechnologiesQ2 ‘24 Q2 ‘23 Change Revenue $158 039 $124 976 26% Gross profit 31 797 20 301 57% Operating profit 11 457 1 480 674% Adjusted EBITDA 17 820 5 415 229%AMG Technologies' second quarter 2024 revenue increased by $33 million  or 26%  compared to the same period in 2023. This improvement was driven by strong revenues in Engineering  as well as higher sales volumes of silicon  graphite  and antimony  and higher sales prices of antimony.SG&A expenses increased by 6% in the second quarter of 2024 compared to the same period in 2023  due to additional personnel at AMG LIVA and AMG Engineering corresponding to the increased business development  as well as increased research and development costs.AMG Technologies’ adjusted EBITDA was $18 million during the second quarter  more than triple the same period in 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher profitability in Engineering as well as graphite and antimony.AMG Engineering signed $90 million in new orders during the second quarter of 2024  representing a 1.15x book to bill ratio. The second quarter 2024 order intake was driven by strong orders of remelting and turbine blade coating furnaces. Order backlog was $310 million as of June 30  2024.AMG Silicon has been operating two of its four furnaces since March 2024  and we plan to run two furnaces for the remainder of 2024. The operational parameters of the silicon business will continue to be reviewed on an ongoing basis. Due to the noted interruptions in AMG Silicon’s operations  the profitability of the business is immaterial and excluded from adjusted EBITDA during this period of abnormal operations.Financial ReviewTaxAMG recorded an income tax expense of $11 million in the second quarter of 2024  compared to $27 million in the second quarter of 2023. This variance was mainly due to lower profitability in the current quarter  but also due to a $7 million increased deferred tax expense related to the depreciation of the Brazilian real versus the US dollar. Fluctuations in the Brazilian real exchange rate impact the valuation of the Company’s net deferred tax positions in Brazil.AMG paid taxes of $4 million in the second quarter of 2024  compared to tax payments of $35 million in the second quarter of 2023. The reduced cash payments in the current period were largely a result of the decrease in profitability year-over-year.Exceptional ItemsAMG’s second quarter 2024 gross profit includes exceptional items  which are not included in the calculation of adjusted EBITDA.A summary of exceptional items included in gross profit in the second quarters of 2024 and 2023 are below:Exceptional items included in gross profitQ2 ‘24 Q2 ‘23 Change Gross profit $55 336 $127 534 (57%) Inventory cost adjustment 3 010 3 678 (18%) Restructuring expense 2 073 626 231% Brazil's SP1+ expansion and commissioning 26 — N/A Silicon’s partial closure (1 719) (1 011) (70%) Strategic project expense (reversal) 1 972 (55) N/A Gross profit excluding exceptional items 60 698 130 772 (54%)AMG had $3 million non-cash expense during the second quarter of 2024 mainly driven by Vanadium’s inventory cost adjustment due to lower vanadium prices  which has been excluded from the calculation of adjusted EBITDA.SG&AAMG’s second quarter 2024 SG&A expenses were $45 million compared to $49 million in the second quarter of 2023. The decrease  as mentioned above in the Vanadium segmental review  was largely driven by a one-time pension expense related to employee benefit plans in the prior period  partially offset by the increase in headcount in our Lithium  Engineering  and LIVA businesses.LiquidityJune 30  2024 December 31  2023 Change Senior secured debt $433 170 $337 402 28% Cash & cash equivalents 307 525 345 308 (11%) Senior secured net debt (cash) 125 645 (7 906) N/A Other debt 10 035 13 105 (23%) Net debt excluding municipal bond 135 680 5 199 N/A Municipal bond debt 318 876 319 002 —% Restricted cash 1 418 1 451 (2%) Net debt 453 138 322 750 40%AMG continued to maintain a strong balance sheet and adequate sources of liquidity during the second quarter.

As such  AMG had $508 million of total liquidity as of June 30  2024.In April 2024  AMG entered into a new $100 million incremental term loan  structured as a fungible add-on to the existing $350 million senior secured term loan. The $100 million incremental term loan has the same pricing  terms and 2028 maturity as the existing $350 million term loan. AMG will use the proceeds of the new incremental term loan for general corporate purposes and lithium resource development.Net Finance CostsAMG’s second quarter 2024 net finance cost was $8 million  3% higher than in the second quarter of 2023.OutlookLooking ahead  we remain focused on our lithium projects and anticipate improved market conditions.

The construction division continues to improve profitability and is on track to achieve its ambitious annual target. In addition  the revenue per transaction on all our U.S. Express Lanes beat inflation and GDP growth levels  while airports experienced a strong performance in traffic "" said Ignacio Madridejos   Ferrovial CEO. ""Our operational strength  coupled with a solid financial position  puts us in the right place to continue taking advantage of strong global trends in infrastructure.""Adjusted EBITDA amounted to $652 million in the period  an increase of 56% year-on-year  while revenue grew 7.5% in like-for-like terms to $4.6 billion .Ferrovial ended the first half with a solid financial position  with liquidity levels reaching $4.6 billion and consolidated net debt amounting to $-38 million   excluding infrastructure projects in both cases. Main cash outflows in the period included shareholder distributions  the acquisition of 24% of IRB Infrastructure Trust and equity investments in the New Terminal One. These were partially offset by the dividends received from infrastructure assets --the first one in the case of I-77 after five years of operation-- and the divestment of a 5% stake in IRB Infrastructure Developers.The company achieved strategic milestones in the first half of 2024. In April  it was awarded Lima's Peripheral Ring Road (PerÃº) as part of a consortium. In May  Ferrovial started trading on Nasdaq  becoming the first company of Spanish origin trading with ordinary shares in the U.S. stock market. In June  Ferrovial announ4ced a new agreement to sell a 19.75% interest in FGP Topco  parent company of Heathrow airport   to Ardian and The Public Investment Fund.Operating resultsThe Toll roads division saw revenue increase by 25.2% in like-for-like terms to $643 million as a result of solid growth in North America .

In particular  I-66 ( Virginia ) registered a 42.5% increase  NTE 35W ( Texas ) 17.5%  I-77 ( North Carolina ) 12.7%  LBJ ( Texas ) 7.8% and NTE ( Texas ) 4.8%. With regards to traffic  the most significant increases were registered on NTE 35W (+38.7%)  thanks to the opening of Segment 3C  as well as on I-66 (+16.6%). NTE saw a 1.8% decline due to construction works.The Construction division ended the first half of the year with a record order book of $17 billion   with North America accounting for 49% of contracts and Poland 22%. Revenue amounted to $3.6 billion   an increase of 4.9% on a like-for-like basis. The Construction division reported an adjusted EBIT of $116 million and an adjusted EBIT margin of 3.2%  placing the unit on track to meet the 3.5% target planned for 2024.The Airports division registered strong growth in traffic during the period. Specifically  Heathrow had its busiest first half-year ever welcoming 39.8 million passengers between January and June  a 7.3% gain year-over-year. As a result of the solid demand  the airport upgraded its traffic projections for 2024 to a new record of 82.8 million passengers  from 82.4 million previously.Aberdeen   Glasgow and Southampton airports also performed well in the first half  with traffic up 7.8%  while Dalaman airport in Turkey reported a 10.4% increase.The New Terminal One Project (NTO) at JFK international airport is progressing within budget and schedule.

Benchmark figures are performance measures used by management. ROIC is based on twelve-months rolling figures. See Note 3 for a reconciliation from IFRS to benchmark figures.Full-Year 2024 OutlookOur group-level guidance for 2024 is unchanged. See table below. We expect sustained good organic growth in 2024  in line with the prior year  and a further increase in the adjusted operating profit margin.Full-Year 2024 Outlook Performance indicators 2024 Guidance 2023 Actual Adjusted operating profit margin* 26.4%-26.8% 26.4% Adjusted free cash flow** €1 150-1 200 million €1 164 million ROIC* 17%-18% 16.8% Diluted adjusted EPS growth** Mid- to high single-digit 12% *Guidance for adjusted operating profit margin and ROIC is in reporting currency and assumes an average EUR/USD rate in 2024 of €/$1.08. **Guidance for adjusted free cash flow and diluted adjusted EPS is in constant currencies (€/$ 1.08). Guidance reflects share repurchases of €1 billion in 2024.In 2023  Wolters Kluwer generated over 60% of its revenues and adjusted operating profit in North America. As a rule of thumb  based on our 2023 currency profile  each 1 U.S. cent move in the average €/$ exchange rate for the year causes an opposite change of approximately 3 euro cents in diluted adjusted EPS1.We include restructuring costs in adjusted operating profit. We expect restructuring costs to be in the range of €10-15 million (FY 2023: €15 million). We now expect adjusted net financing costs2 in constant currencies to be approximately €55 million (previous guidance €60 million). We continue to expect the full-year benchmark tax rate on adjusted pre-tax profits to be in the range of 23.0%-24.0% (FY 2023: 22.9%).Capital expenditures are expected to be near the upper end of our guidance range of 5.0%-6.0% of total revenues (FY 2023: 5.8%). We continue to expect the full-year cash conversion ratio to be around 95% (FY 2023: 100%) due to lower net working capital inflows.Our guidance assumes no additional significant change to the scope of operations. We may make further acquisitions or disposals which can be dilutive to margins  earnings  and ROIC in the near term.2024 outlook by divisionOur guidance for full-year 2024 organic revenue growth by division is summarized below. We now expect the increase in group adjusted profit margin to be driven by our Finance & Corporate Compliance  Legal & Regulatory  and Corporate Performance & ESG divisions.Health: we continue to expect full-year 2024 organic growth to be in line with prior year (FY 2023: 6%). The division margin is now expected to be stable due to one-time write-offs to streamline the portfolio.Tax & Accounting: we continue to expect full-year 2024 organic growth to be slightly below prior year (FY 2023: 8%) due to slower growth in non-recurring revenues and the absence of one-time favorable events in Europe. The division margin is expected to decline slightly due to increased product investment.Financial & Corporate Compliance: we now expect full-year 2024 organic growth to be higher than prior year (FY 2023: 2%) as transactional revenue trends continue to stabilize.Legal & Regulatory: we continue to expect full-year 2024 organic growth to be in line with prior year (FY 2023: 4%).Corporate Performance & ESG: we now expect full-year 2024 organic growth to be in line with or slightly higher than in the prior year (FY 2023: 9%) as Finance  Risk & Reporting revenues stabilize.Progress against 2022-2024 strategyIn the first half of 2024  we continued to execute on the three priorities of our current strategic plan:Accelerate Expert Solutions : we are focusing our investments on cloud-based expert solutions while continuing to transform selected digital information products into expert solutions. We are investing to enrich the customer experience of our products by leveraging advanced data analytics and artificial intelligence.we are focusing our investments on cloud-based expert solutions while continuing to transform selected digital information products into expert solutions. We are investing to enrich the customer experience of our products by leveraging advanced data analytics and artificial intelligence. Expand Our Reach : we are seeking to extend into high-growth adjacencies along our customer workflows and to adapt our existing products for new customer segments. We are working to develop partnerships and ecosystems for our key software platforms.we are seeking to extend into high-growth adjacencies along our customer workflows and to adapt our existing products for new customer segments. We are working to develop partnerships and ecosystems for our key software platforms. Evolve Core Capabilities: we are enhancing our central functions to drive excellence and scale economies  mainly in sales and marketing (go-to-market) and in technology. We plan to advance our sustainability and ESG performance and capabilities and to continue investing in diverse and engaged talent to support innovation and growth.A more detailed discussion of our strategy and business model can be found in our 2023 annual report.Expert solutions  which include our software products and certain advanced information solutions  reached 59% of total revenues in the first half (HY 2023: 58%) and grew 8% organically (HY 2023: 7%). We made progress on further enhancing our expert solutions with artificial intelligence including generative AI (GenAI). As of July 2024  all five divisions have solutions in market that leverage GenAI  with more in the pipeline.We expanded our market reach in several areas through organic development: in Health  we expanded our entry into the nursing test preparation market with Lippincott Ready for NCLEX3 and we launched a solution to help healthcare providers streamline the risk adjustment process with Health Language Coder Workbench. In Finance & Corporate Compliance  we introduced an innovative BOI4 platform to support customers with the U.S. Corporate Transparency Act (CTA). In Legal & Regulatory  we launched LegalCollaborator  a module that integrates with ELM’s Passport and TyMetrix 360 to enable an efficient and transparent process for law firm comparison and selection. And  in Corporate Performance & ESG  we extended further into the corporate ESG reporting market by adding scope 3 carbon emissions reporting capabilities to the CCH Tagetik ESG & Sustainability module.Finally  having brought together core capabilities in product development  finance  digital marketing  branding  and communications over the course of the past two years  we are now focused on driving scale economies and operational excellence in these centralized functions.Financial policy  capital allocation  net debt  and liquidityWolters Kluwer uses its free cash flow to invest in the business organically and through acquisitions  to maintain optimal leverage  and to provide returns to shareholders. We regularly assess our financial position and evaluate the appropriate level of debt in view of our expectations for cash flow  investment plans  interest rates  and capital market conditions. While we may temporarily deviate from our leverage target  we continue to believe that  in the longer run  a net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio of around 2.5x remains appropriate for our business given the high proportion of recurring revenues and resilient cash flows.Dividend policy and interim dividend 2024Wolters Kluwer remains committed to a progressive dividend policy  under which we aim to increase the dividend per share in euros each year  independent of currency fluctuations. The payout ratio5 can therefore vary from year to year. Proposed annual increases in the dividend per share consider our ﬁnancial performance  market conditions  and our need for ﬁnancial ﬂexibility. The policy takes into account the characteristics of our business  our expectations for future cash ﬂows  and our plans for organic investment in innovation and productivity  or for acquisitions. We balance these factors with the objective of maintaining a strong balance sheet.Shareholders can choose to reinvest both interim and ﬁnal dividends by purchasing additional Wolters Kluwer shares through the Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP) administered by ABN AMRO Bank N.V.Progress on 2024 share buybackAs a matter of policy since 2012  Wolters Kluwer will offset the dilution caused by our annual incentive share issuance with share repurchases (Anti-Dilution Policy). In addition  from time to time when appropriate  we return capital to shareholders through share buyback programs. Shares repurchased by the company are added to and held as treasury shares and are either cancelled or utilized to meet future obligations arising from share-based incentive plans.On February 21  2024  we announced our intention to repurchase shares for up to €1 billion during 2024. So far this year  up to and including July 30  2024  we have repurchased €603 million in shares (4 150 509 shares at an average price of €145.28).For the remainder of this year  up to and including December 27  2024  we have in place third-party mandates to execute approximately €397 million in share buybacks on our behalf  within the limits of relevant laws and regulations (in particular Regulation (EU) 596/2014) and the company’s Articles of Association. The maximum number of shares which may be repurchased will not exceed the authorization granted by the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders.Assuming global economic conditions do not deteriorate substantially  we believe this level of share buybacks leaves us with ample headroom to support our dividend plans  to sustain organic investment  and to make selective acquisitions. The share repurchase program may be suspended  discontinued  or modified at any time.Share cancellation 2024At the 2024 Annual General Meeting on May 8  2024  shareholders approved a resolution to cancel for capital reduction purposes any or all ordinary shares held in treasury or to be acquired by the company  up to a maximum of 10% of issued share capital. As of July 30  2024  Wolters Kluwer held 11.6 million shares in treasury (equivalent to approximately 4.7% of issued share capital). As authorized by shareholders  the Executive Board has determined the number of ordinary shares to be cancelled this year is 10.0 million. Wolters Kluwer intends to cancel these shares in the second half of 2024. The remaining treasury shares will be retained to meet future obligations under share-based incentive plans.Net debt  leverage  credit facility  and liquidity positionNet debt on June 30  2024  was €2 932 million  up from €2 612 million on December 31  2023  mainly due to dividends paid and the share buyback. The net-debt-to-EBITDA ratio increased to 1.6x at the end of June 2024 (YE 2023: 1.5x). Gross debt includes the new €600 million Eurobond (5-year term; 3.250% annual coupon) issued on March 18  2024.As of June 30  2024  our €600 million multi-currency revolving credit facility remained fully undrawn. In July 2024  we signed a new €600 million 5-year multi-currency revolving credit facility  replacing the existing facility which was due to expire in July 2025. The new facility matures in 2029 and includes two one-year extension options.As of June 30  2024  net cash available was €808 million6.Half-Year 2024 ResultsBenchmark figuresGroup revenues were €2 891 million  up 6% overall and up 6% in constant currencies. The effect of currency and the net effect of divestments and acquisitions were minimal in the first half of 2024 such that organic revenue growth was also 6% (HY 2023: 6%).Revenues from North America accounted for 65% of total group revenues and grew 6% organically (HY 2023: 5%). Revenues from Europe  27% of total revenues  also grew 6% organically (HY 2023: 7%). Revenues from Asia Pacific and Rest of World  8% of total revenues  grew 10% organically (HY 2023: 6%).Adjusted operating profit was €765 million (HY 2023: €711 million)  up 8% in constant currencies. The adjusted operating profit margin increased by 40 basis points to 26.5% (HY 2023: 26.1%). Restructuring expenses  which are included in adjusted operating profit  were €3 million (HY 2023: €2 million). Product development spending (including capitalized spend) increased 5% in constant currencies  remaining at 11% of revenues in the first half (HY 2023: 11%).Adjusted net financing costs increased to €25 million (HY 2023: €10 million)  reflecting higher debt and a higher average effective cost of debt. Included in adjusted net financing costs was a €6 million net foreign exchange loss (HY 2023: €5 million net foreign exchange gain) mainly due to the translation of intercompany balances.Adjusted profit before tax was €741 million (HY 2023: €701 million)  up 6% overall and up 7% in constant currencies. The benchmark effective tax rate on adjusted profit before tax increased to 23.6% (HY 2023: 23.3%)  due to increased limitations on deduction of finance cost in the Netherlands and the application of the Global Minimum Tax (Pillar Two) regulation.Adjusted net profit was €566 million (HY 2023: €537 million)  an increase of 7% in constant currencies.Diluted adjusted EPS was €2.36 (HY 2023: €2.17)  up 11% in constant currencies  reflecting the increase in adjusted net profit and a 3% reduction in the diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding to 240.1 million (HY 2023: 248.0 million).IFRS reported figuresReported operating profit increased 9% to €690 million (HY 2023: €632 million)  reflecting the increase in adjusted operating profit combined with lower amortization and impairments of acquired intangible assets and other non-benchmark costs.Reported financing results amounted to a net cost of €26 million (HY 2023: €11 million cost) reflecting higher debt and a higher average effective cost of debt. The reported effective tax rate increased to 23.4% (HY 2023: 22.8%) due to increased limitations on deduction of finance cost in the Netherlands and the application of the Global Minimum Tax (Pillar Two) tax regulation.As a result  net profit for the period increased 6% to €509 million (HY 2023: €479 million). Diluted EPS increased 10% to €2.12 (HY 2023: €1.93)  benefitting from the reduction in weighted average number of shares outstanding.Cash flowAdjusted operating cash flow was €624 million (HY 2023: €673 million)  down 7% overall and down 7% in constant currencies  broadly as expected and partly reflecting the timing of large vendor payments. The cash conversion ratio declined to 82% (HY 2023: 95%) due to working capital outflows of €117 million compared to a small inflow in the comparable period (HY 2023: €11 million inflow). Capital expenditures declined 6% to €147 million (5.1% of revenues) mainly due to the phasing of development projects. Cash payments related to leases  including lease interest paid  reduced to €35 million (HY 2023: €38 million). Depreciation of physical assets  amortization and impairment of internally developed software  and depreciation of right-of-use assets totaled €158 million (HY 2023: €146 million).Net interest paid  excluding lease interest paid  increased to €23 million (HY 2023: €18 million)  reflecting the higher coupon on the Eurobond issued in April 2023. Income tax paid decreased to €171 million (HY 2023: €176 million)  reflecting timing of refunds and prepayments. The net cash outflow related to restructuring was €2 million (HY 2023: net outflow of €3 million). As a result  adjusted free cash flow was €445 million (HY 2023: €495 million)  down 10% in constant currencies.Total acquisition spending  net of cash acquired and including transaction costs  was €2 million (HY 2023: €56 million) relating to deferred payments on acquisitions made in prior years. Dividends paid amounted to €276 million (HY 2023: €247 million). Cash deployed towards share repurchases in the first six months amounted to €516 million (HY 2023: €426 million).Sustainability and ESG developmentsWith regard to our own workforce  our primary focus in the first half of 2024 was to continue attracting and retaining top talent in what remain competitive markets  especially for technology skills. Our human resources programs currently emphasize career development and manager enablement as well as fostering a supportive and engaging work environment. In the first half  our workforce turnover rate was stable at 10% (HY 2023: 10%; FY 2023: 10%) with voluntary turnover at 7%.We remain focused on delivering on our SBTi-validated emissions-reduction targets  which commit us to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 50% and absolute scope 3 GHG emissions by 30% by the year 2030 from a 2019 base year. Business travel activity increased in the first half  in part due to a year-on-year increase in FTEs. However  we made progress on reducing our real estate footprint (and related scope 1 and 2 emissions) achieving a 4% underlying reduction in office space (m2) compared to year-end 2023.Our sustainability efforts were recognized with a further improvement in our ESG risk rating from Morningstar Sustainalytics to 13.2 (from 14.4) bolstering our position in the top 5% of companies in the Software & Services sector globally.We continued work to align our sustainability reporting with the standards set by the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD).The full results are available in PDF format belowAbout Wolters KluwerWolters Kluwer (EURONEXT: WKL) is a global leader in information  software solutions and services for professionals in healthcare; tax and accounting; financial and corporate compliance; legal and regulatory; corporate performance and ESG.

Two divestments were successfully completed  sharpening our focus on Core Markets further  and our cost transformation program delivered solid efficiency gains yet again. This consistent delivery  coupled with our sustainable innovation pipeline  allows us to grow our business in North America and strengthen it in Europe  which gives me confidence to deliver a strong year. Aiming to further strengthen our competitive position  we announced the intention to restructure our Belgian production and distribution activities. These measures will allow us to further reinforce and grow our business sustainably  while driving profitability and cash flow generation up.”H1 2024 resultsRevenue [1] was €916 million  up 3% like for like.

The LFL comparison is corrected for this scope reduction.H1 2024 business review of Core Markets (continuing operations)RevenueRevenue was €916 million  up 3% like for like  with higher  volume-driven  adult care sales of 11%  more than compensating for a price-related decrease in baby care and in feminine care of 2% and 3% respectively. Forex fluctuations had no meaningful net effect  leaving revenue growth at 3% overall compared to the first half of 2023  and 1% compared to the second half.Volumes were up 5%  including mix effects  driven by strong double-digit volume growth in North America and in selected product categories.The strong increase in North America contrasted with the overall stable demand for baby care products in the region  thereby highlighting Ontex’s share gains. These were based on new contracts that started during the second half of 2023  the first quarter of 2024 and at the end of the second quarter. Further volume growth in the year will be supported by additional secured contracts. The year-on-year comparison was partly helped by customer destocking in the first quarter of 2023 which depressed order levels at that time.In Europe  overall demand for baby care products weakened  while they were stable for feminine care and growing for adult care  in line with the demographic evolution. While promotional activities by branded players  temper the previous share gains of retail brands in baby diapers  the latter continue to outperform in baby pants and in the feminine and adult category. Ontex’s sales volumes in Europe overall reflected these market trends  with lower sales in baby diapers and strong increases in baby pants and in adult care  especially in the healthcare channel.Prices were 2% lower on average. While in certain categories  such as healthcare  prices remained relatively stable  as these contracts typically have a longer term and are more rigid  prices have been coming down sequentially in other categories since the second half of 2023. This was expected  in view of the raw material price index decreases which had started earlier that year.Adjusted EBITDAAdjusted EBITDA was €110 million  up 31% compared to the first half of 2023  and 22% compared to the second half. Continued delivery on the cost transformation program  coupled with sustainable innovation  strengthened profitability and competitiveness  servicing customers better and managing prices to invest in further volume growth. Meanwhile  volume growth and mix improvement contributed €6 million. The net cost inflation impact was largely flat and forex effects were supportive.The cost transformation program delivered €37 million net operating savings  leading to a reduction of the operating cost base by 4.9%. Product innovations  manufacturing and supply chain improvements  and especially procurement initiatives remain the drivers behind the structural savings. In June  Ontex announced the intention to restructure its Belgian production and distribution activities  as part of its strategic transformation to strengthen its competitive position in the European market. It would entail the closure of the Eeklo site  as well as the transformation of the Buggenhout site into a center of excellence for research  development and production of medium and heavy incontinence care products. This initiative aims at strengthening Ontex’s operational cost-efficiency across Europe  allowing to pursue the structural operating efficiency gains so far.Costs were €3 million higher on a net basis. Raw material cost decreases had a €20 million positive impact  reflecting the year-on-year lower price indices for fluff  super-absorbent polymers and non-woven materials. However  these indices have started to rise sequentially again  compared to the end of 2023. Other operating costs were up by €11 million year on year  largely due to inflation of salaries  energy and distribution costs. SG&A expenditure was up by €12 million  with wage inflation and actualization of variable remuneration in the half year.Forex fluctuations had a €2 million net positive impact  mainly linked to the appreciation of some non-euro currencies in Europe.The adjusted EBITDA margin rose to 12.0%  up 2.6pp compared to the first half of 2023  and 2.0pp compared to the second half.Q2 2024 business review of Core Markets (continuing operations)RevenueRevenue was €456 million  up 2% like for like  with a solid volume-driven increase in adult care of 11%  more than compensating for a price-related decrease in baby care of 4% and in feminine care of 3%. Forex fluctuations had a minor positive effect  leaving revenue to grow 2% year on year overall  and to reduce 1% quarter on quarter.Volumes  including mix effects  were up 5% year on year  driven by solid growth in selected categories  and especially in North America. The latter was largely based on contracts that kicked in in the prior quarters and to a lesser extent in the quarter. Ontex’s sales volumes in Europe were up significantly in adult care  especially in the healthcare channel  and in other selected categories such as baby pants  while in baby diapers volumes were down  in line with market trends.Prices were down across categories and 3% on average compared to last year. These decreases were expected  and in line with the raw material price index decreases during last year.Adjusted EBITDAAdjusted EBITDA was €57 million  up 32% year on year  and 8% quarter on quarter  mainly thanks to relentless focus on delivering on the cost transformation program  which more than covered for the price decreases. Volume growth and mix improvement contributed €5 million. Lower raw material costs more than compensated for other operating and SG&A cost inflation. Forex effects had a small positive contribution.The cost transformation program resulted in €19 million net operating savings  leading to a reduction of the operating cost base by 5.0%. Product innovations  manufacturing and supply chain improvements  and especially procurement initiatives were the drivers behind the structural savings.Costs decreased by €2 million net versus last year. Year-on-year decreases of the raw material price indices had a €13 million positive impact. Other operating costs were up by €5 million year on year  largely due to inflation of wages  energy and distribution costs  and SG&A expenditure was up by €6 million year on year  on wage inflation and variable remuneration actualisations as in the first quarter.Forex fluctuations had a €1 million net positive impact  mainly linked to the appreciation of some non-euro currencies in Europe.The adjusted EBITDA margin rose to 12.5%  up 2.8pp year on year and 1.0pp quarter on quarter.Key financial indicatorsFinancial results H1 in € million 2024 2023 % Adj.

December 2023.H1 2024 financial review of Total GroupP&LDepreciation & amortization from continuing operations was slightly up at €(36) million  reflecting the higher investment level.EBITDA adjustments of €42 million were made in continuing operations. These adjust for €(38) million restructuring provisions accounted for as “Income & expenses related to changes in Group structure”  and consist primarily of €(37) million provisioned for the intended restructuring of the Belgian operating footprint. This amount reflects the potential redundancy cost for the employees concerned according to the Belgian legal requirements. As the social information and consultation round is still ongoing  and negotiations were not started up  no reliable estimate for the social plan beyond these legal requirements could be made. EBITDA adjustments were also made for €(4) million related asset impairments  accounted for as “Income & expenses related to impairments & major litigations”.Net finance cost from continuing operations was €(27) million  slightly higher than €(25) million in 2023  as forex effects offset the reduced interest charge. The latter is the result of lower indebtedness  following the repayment of the €220 million term loan mid last year.Income tax result from continuing operations was a positive €5 million  compared to a €(9) million charge a year ago  following the recognition of deferred tax assets in the period in view of the improving profitability.Discontinued operations  consisting of the Emerging Markets division  generated a revenue of €166 million  a 5% like for like decrease versus 2023  excluding forex and scope effects  following the divestment of the Mexican business in 2023 and the Algerian and Pakistani businesses earlier in this year. The adjusted EBITDA was €20 million resulting in a margin of 12.1%  almost double the 6.7% from a year ago  reflecting the improvement of the remaining businesses in Turkey and Brazil. The operating loss was €(7) million  compared to €(3) million last year  which still included the partial contribution from the Mexican business and the full contribution of the Algerian and Pakistani business. It includes some divestment-related costs as well as the non-cash recycling of €(20) million currency translation adjustments through the P&L  from “Cumulative translation reserves” to “Retained earnings and other reserves” in the equity. This follows the finalization of the divestment of the Algerian and Pakistani businesses in the period.Loss of the period for the Total Group was €(6) million  compared to €(19) million the year before  and consists of the €(15) million loss from discontinued operations and the €10 million profit from continuing operations. The latter compares to €2 million in 2023  and includes the impact of restructuring and impairment related costs. Excluding these  the adjusted profit from continuing operations was €41 million  well up versus €12 million the year before. Basic earnings per share of the Total Group were €(0.07)  compared to €(0.24) in 2023.Cash flowCapital expenditure was €(38) million  representing 3.5% of the Total Group revenue. The ratio is relatively low compared to the expected ratio for the year  due to phasing of payments  and is expected to accelerate in the second half  to support investments in the North American business expansion and the further implementation of the cost transformation program. Capital expenditure excludes financial leases which amounted to €(12) million  largely in line with 2023. The combined capital expenditure and leases represented 1.4x the depreciation.Free cash flow amounted to €43 million  well up compared to €(29) million in 2023  reflecting the strong operational delivery and helped by capex phasing. Working capital needs to support the business expansion and transformation amounted to €(12) million  while cash-out for restructuring and primarily divestment-related cash costs were €(5) million. Cash taxes were €(5) million and net financing cash-out totaled €(17) million  substantially lower than in 2023  as the interest payments decreased  and in 2023 significant transaction costs were paid related to the renegotiated revolving credit facility.M&A cash flow totaled €34 million. Early April  Ontex completed the divestment of its Algerian business  and in June its Pakistani business. The net cash proceeds for both transactions combined so far were €25 million net of cash disposed  but remain subject to taxes  transaction costs and the customary post-closing adjustments  likely to be paid in the second half of the year. A deferred receivable related to the divestment of the Mexican business in 2023 still remained outstanding. In the first half year €8 million was received from the acquirer  and €19 million remains due within the next four years.Balance sheetNet working capital for the Total Group at the end of the period was €151 million  a €16 million decrease versus the end of 2023  largely linked to the divestment of the Algerian and Pakistani businesses. Net working capital in the remaining operations were largely stable  reflecting a relative improvement versus revenue. Trade receivables increased in line with the growing business  partly offset by slightly higher factoring activity  i.e. €170 million at the end of June. Inventories were up more to support the ramp-up in revenue in North America and the footprint adjustments in Europe. Increased trade payables offset these increases  however  reflecting better payment terms as a result of the cost transformation program.Net financial debt for the Total Group dropped €77 million  from €665 million to €588 million over the half year  thanks to the solid free cash flow and the inflow from recent divestments. The leverage ratio decreased further from 3.25x at the start of the year to 2.49x end of June  as a combination of the net financial debt reduction and especially the further increase of the adjusted EBITDA of the Total Group of the last twelve months.Gross financial debt of the Total Group reduced even more  by €86 million  from €834 million to €748 million  thanks to cash optimization. It consists primarily of the €580 million bond at fixed 3.5% rate maturing in July 2026  of €130 million of short- and long-term lease liabilities  and of €32 million drawn on the floating rate revolving credit facility with a maximum capacity of €242 million. The available liquidity of the Total Group increased from €322 million to €370 million  consisting of the €160 million cash and cash equivalents and the undrawn part of the revolving credit facility.Assets-held-for-sale at the end of the period  i.e. the Brazilian and Turkish businesses  are valued at €141 million net on the balance sheet and include a €57 million net cash position. The balance sheet also includes €(211) million of cumulative translation reserves in equity related to these assets.DisclaimerThis report may include forward-looking statements.

Margins and free cash flow hold steady at very good levels.This performance highlights once again the relevance of our business model  and we stand by the annual targets announced in early February.We are continuing to roll out our strategy  as illustrated by the very strong pace of external growth since the beginning of the year  with five acquisitions including three in the datacenter segment. This momentum will continue in the quarters to come. We are innovating relentlessly  with launches of a large number of new products including the new CÃ©liane iconic range of wiring devices in France.2024 full-year targets unchanged1In 2024  the Group is pursuing the profitable and responsible development laid out in its strategic roadmap. Taking into account the world's current macroeconomic outlook  with confidence in its model for creating integrated value  Legrand has set the following full-year targets for 2024:- low single-digit sales growth (organic and through acquisitions2);- an adjusted operating margin before acquisitions between 20.0% and 20.8%;- at least 100% CSR achievement rate for the third year of the 2022-2024 roadmap.1 For more information  see Legrand press releases dated February 15 and May 3  20242 Excluding exchange-rate effect and impacts linked to the Group's disengagement from RussiaFinancial performance at June 30  2024 Key figures Consolidated data ( € millions)(1) 1st half 2023 1st half 2024 Change Sales 4 294.8 4 210.3 -2.0% Adjusted operating profit 954.7 873.1 -8.5% As % of sales 22.2% 20.7% 20.8% before acquisitions (2) Operating profit 892.3 811.5 -9.1% As % of sales 20.8% 19.3% Net profit attributable to the Group 650.9 577.6 -11.3% As % of sales 15.2% 13.7% Normalized free cash flow 766.9 734.6 -4.2% As % of sales 17.9% 17.4% Free cash flow 813.8 468.1 -42.5 % As % of sales 18.9% 11.1% Net financial debt at June 30 2 415.5 3 429.9 +42.0% (1) See appendices to this press release for definitions and indicator reconciliation tables (2) At 2023 scope of consolidationConsolidated salesIn the first half of 2024  sales were down a total of -2.0% from the same period of 2023  reaching €4 210.3 million.In a building market which remains depressed in many geographies  the organic decline in sales was -2.0% over the period  including -0.9% in mature countries and -5.1% in new economies.The impact of broader scope of consolidation was +0.4%  including +1.3% linked to acquisitions and -0.9% to the impact of the Group's disengagement from Russia. Based on acquisitions made and their likely dates of consolidation  their overall impact should be close to +2% full year  of which nearly +2.5% linked to acquisitions and -0.6% to the impact of disengagement from Russia as of October 4  2023.The exchange-rate effect on sales in the first half of 2024 was -0.4%. Based on average exchange rates in June 2024 alone  the full-year effect should be close to -0.5% in 2024.Changes in sales by destination at constant scope of consolidation and exchange rates broke down as follows by region:1st half 2024 / 1st half 2023 2nd quarter 2024 / 2nd quarter 2023 Europe -3.2% -1.5% North and Central America +0.0% +5.8% Rest of the world -3.1% -0.7% Total -2.0% +1.5%These changes are analyzed below by geographical region:Europe (41.5% of Group revenue): in a persistently tough building market in most countries  sales at constant scope of consolidation and exchange rates fell ‘3.2% in the first half of 2024.In Europe's mature countries (36.3% of Group revenue)  sales decreased organically by -3.1% in the first half of 2024  including -0.9% in the second quarter alone  with robust resilience in the first six months notably in Italy  the United Kingdom  Spain and Scandinavia.Sales in Europe's new economies declined by -3.8% in the first half. In the second quarter alone  sales decreased -5.5%  including a marked decline in Central Europe.North and Central America (38.9% of Group revenue): sales were stable from the first half of 2023 at constant scope of consolidation and exchange rates.In the United States alone (35.6% of Group revenue)  sales rose +1.0% in the first six months of the year  including a steep +7.9% rise in the second quarter alone. This solid performance in the second quarter was driven by marked growth in the datacenter segment and an increase in non-residential applications.Over the first half  sales declined in Canada and Mexico.Rest of the world (19.6% of Group revenue): sales marked an organic decline of -3.1% in the first half of 2024.In Asia-Pacific (12.2% of Group revenue)  sales declined by -4.1% in the first half of the year and by -2.6% in the second quarter alone. This downward momentum reflects growth in India offset by a strong decline in China where building markets are in a sharp slump.In Africa and the Middle East (3.4% of Group revenue)  sales were down -5.3% in the first six months of the year and -4.2% in the second quarter. Over six months  sales trends were sustained in the Middle East and showed a double-digit decline in Africa.In South America (4.0% of Group revenue)  sales were up +1.9 % in the first half  with marked growth in Brazil  and advanced a strong +9.8% in the second quarter alone.Adjusted operating profit and marginAdjusted operating profit for the first half of 2024 stood at €873.1 million  down -8.5% from the first half of 2023. This corresponds to an adjusted operating margin equal to 20.7% of sales for the period.Before acquisitions  adjusted operating margin for the first half of 2024 stood at 20.8% of sales  down -1.4 points from the first half of 2023.Over this period  Group profitability confirmed the ability of Legrand to hold margins high despite a decrease in sales.Value creation and solid balance sheetNet profit attributable to the Group came to €577.6 million  down -11.3% from the first half of 2023 and equal to 13.7% of sales. This trend was due primarily to a decline in operating profit  the negative impact of financial results and exchange-rate effects  and a corporate income tax rate of 27.0% for the first half of 2024.Free cash flow came to 11.1% of sales over the period  to total €468.1 million.The ratio of net debt to EBITDA1 stood at 1.8 on June 30  2024  a level that reflects the pace of acquisitions since the beginning of the year  as well as a solid free cash flow generation  and is fully consistent with the Group's credit rating.Following a €600 million bond issue in June 2024  Legrand Group's cash position stood at €2.1 billion on June 30  2024  and the maturity of gross debt ” with close to 90% in fixed-rate instruments ” was 4.8 years.Accelerating acquisitions strategyIn the first half of 2024  Legrand continued and accelerated its bolt-on external growth strategy through 5 operations  bringing acquired sales on an annual basis to more than €200 million:- in the buoyant datacenters segment  the acquisition of Netrack (Indian specialist in racks)  Davenham (Irish specialist in low-voltage power distribution systems) and Vass (Australian leader in busbars);- in the assisted living segment  Enovation  the Dutch leader in connected health software;- lastly  in the cable management segment  New Zealand specialist MSS.Legrand intends to continue to strengthen its positions with targeted  complementary acquisitions in the coming quarters.Strong product innovation momentumAs announced at the beginning of the year  the launch of numerous new products during the first half demonstrates the Group's continued robust capacity for innovation  with  for example:- Core infrastructure products including new wiring device ranges: CÃ©liane (in France)  Ultra Thin and Eco Full Rocker (in China)  Seano (in Germany and Austria)  the extension of lighting solutions ranges Seem 1 and Rev families extension as well as Seem Sweep 2 and TruTile (in the USA)  and the increased proportion of recycled material in tri-layer conduits Standard and Octogliss ranges (in France);- In faster expanding segments  Linkeo DC and NX1 PDUs (datacenters  energy efficiency and connected products)  DPX3 et DMX3 connected power breakers  KNX Mallia Senses lighting and temperature touch screens control panels (energy efficiency and connected products)  Cable Bus cable management solutions  and M70 critical power monitors (datacenters and connected products)  new LCS3 accIAIM and OM5 fibre digital infrastructure solutions and Cablobend cable management offer (datacenters)  Green'Up metering cabinets for electric vehicle infrastructure (energy efficiency)  renewal of the NMR dynamization IOT connected wiring range in China  and 4-Wires Kit new video door entry system range for India (connected products).1 Based on EBITDA for the past 12 monthsThe consolidated financial statements for the first half of 2024 were subject to a limited review by the Group's auditors and were adopted by the Board of Directors at its meeting on July 30  2024.

SECOND QUARTER AND HALF-YEAR RESULTSSecond quarter and half-year salesIn Q2 2024  consolidated sales stood at €6 938m  up +4.0% on a like-for-like basis  led by an increase of +2.9% from volume/mix and +1.0% from price.

Reported sales were also negatively impacted by forex(-2.4%)  reflecting the depreciation of several currencies against the euro  including notably the Chinese Renminbi  the Indonesian Rupiah  the Turkish Lira and the Argentine Peso. In addition  hyperinflation contributed positively to reported sales (+1.5%).In H1 2024  consolidated sales stood at €13 757m  up +4.0% on a like-for-like basis  with a balanced contribution from volume/mix (+2.1%) and price (+2.0%).

ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES NOT DEFINED BY IFRSIAS 29: impact on reported dataDanone has applied IAS 29 in hyperinflation countries as defined in IFRS. Adoption of IAS 29 in hyperinflationary countries requires their non-monetary assets and liabilities and their income statement to be restated to reflect the changes in the general purchasing power of its functional currency  leading to a gain or loss on the net monetary position included in the net income. Moreover  its financial statements are converted into euros using the closing exchange rate of the relevant period.IAS 29: impact on reported data€ million except % Q2 2024 H1 2024 Sales 7 50 Sales growth (%) +0.1% +0.4% Recurring Operating Income (40) Recurring Net Income – Group share (72)Breakdown by quarter of H1 2024 sales after application of IAS 29H1 2024 sales correspond to the addition of:Q2 2024 reported sales;Q1 2024 sales resulting from the application of IAS 29 until June 30  2024  to sales of entities in hyperinflation countries (application of the inflation rate until June 30  2024  and translation into euros using the June 30  2024  closing rate) and provided in the table below for information (unaudited data)€ million Q1 20241 Q2 2024 H1 2024 Europe 2 336 2 447 4 783 North America 1 737 1 595 3 331 China  North Asia & Oceania 840 1 001 1 841 Latin America 745 810 1 556 Rest of the World 1 161 1 084 2 246 Total 6 819 6 938 13 7571Results from the application of IAS 29 until June 30  2024  to Q1 sales of entities of hyperinflation countries.Definitions of geographical zonesEurope refers to European countries and Ukraine.North America includes United States and Canada.China  North Asia & Oceania includes China  Japan  Australia and New-Zealand.Latin America includes Mexico  Brazil  Argentina and Uruguay.Rest of the World includes Asia  Middle East including Turkey  Africa and CIS.Financial indicators not defined in IFRSDue to rounding  the sum of values presented may differ from totals as reported. Such differences are not material.Like-for-like changes in sales reflect Danone's organic performance and essentially exclude the impact of:changes in consolidation scope  with indicators related to a given fiscal year calculated on the basis of the previous year's scope;changes in applicable accounting principles;changes in exchange rates  with both previous-year and current-year indicators calculated using the same exchange rates (the exchange rate used is a projected annual rate determined by Danone for the current year and applied to both previous and current years).Since January 1st  2023  all countries with hyperinflationary economies are taken into account in like-for-like changes as follows: net sales growth in excess of around 26% per year (a three-year average at 26% would generally trigger the application of hyperinflationary accounting as defined in IFRS) is now excluded from the like-for-like net sales growth calculation.Bridge from reported data to like-for-like data(€ million except %) 2023 sales Like-for-like change Impact of changesin scope of consolidation Impact of changes in exchange rates & others incl.

Other operating income and expenses comprise items that  because of their significant or unusual nature  cannot be viewed as inherent to Danone’s recurring activity and have limited predictive value  thus distorting the assessment of its recurring operating performance and its evolution. These mainly include:capital gains and losses on disposals of businesses and fully consolidated companies;impairment charges on intangible assets with indefinite useful lives;costs related to strategic restructuring operations or transformation plans;costs related to major external growth transactions;costs related to crises and major disputes;in connection with IFRS 3 and IFRS 10  (i) acquisition costs related to acquisitions of companies resulting in control  (ii) revaluation gains or losses accounted for following a loss of control  and (iii) changes in earn-outs subsequent to acquisitions resulting in control.Recurring operating margin is defined as the Recurring operating income over Sales ratio.Other non-recurring financial income and expense corresponds to financial income and expense items that  in view of their significant or unusual nature  cannot be considered as inherent to Danone’s recurring financial management.

These items mainly relate to (i) capital gains and losses on disposals of investments in equity-accounted companies  (ii) impairment of goodwill  and (iii) non-recurring items  as defined by Danone  included in the share of profit (loss) of equity-accounted companies.Recurring net income (or Recurring net income – Group Share) corresponds to the Group share of the consolidated Recurring net income. The Recurring net income excludes items that  because of their significant or unusual nature  cannot be viewed as inherent to Danone’s recurring activity and have limited predictive value  thus distorting the assessment of its recurring performance and its evolution. Such non-recurring income and expenses correspond to Other operating income and expenses  Other non-recurring financial income and expenses  Non-recurring income tax  and Non-recurring share of profit of equity-accounted companies.

Across the rest of the Group  BIC remains well positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities with strong net sales growth during the first half.In this context  it is imperative to continue to focus on what we can control by doubling down on our effort to deliver our strategic plan. In addition  we are adapting our cost structure to the current challenging business environment while amplifying our commercial and operational strengths.Revenue Growth Management continued to deliver amidst our net sales decline  resulting in a 12% reduction of total SKU count versus last year. Our digital capabilities continue to have a strong impact  with core e-commerce net sales growing double-digit in H1. We also continue to deliver on our sustainability commitments  particularly contributing to our goal of improving learning conditions for 250 million students by 2025.As we look up to the end of the year  we confirm our outlook for 2024.”2024 Outlook (based on current market assumptions2)Full Year 2024 Net Sales are expected to grow low single digit at constant currency3. We expect to see a slight improvement in 2024 adjusted EBIT margin. We will continue to drive EBIT expansion to deliver long-term profitable growth  in line with our 2025 targets. Free Cash Flow is expected to be above €220 million in 2024.H1 2024 key highlightsin million euros Q2 2023 Q2 2024 H1 2023 H1 2024 Net Sales 638.2 617.8 1 176.9 1 139.4 Gross Profit 312.7 305.0 580.8 562.2 Gross Profit margin 49.0% 49.4% 49.3% 49.3% EBITDA 128.3 131.3 224.1 202.0 EBIT 102.8 99.5 174.7 154.5 EBIT margin 16.1% 16.1% 14.8% 13.6% Non-recurring items 2.2 7.8 0.4 15.6 Adjusted EBIT 105.0 107.4 175.1 170.2 Adjusted EBIT margin 16.5% 17.4% 14.9% 14.9%H1 2024 net sales decreased by 0.5% at constant currency3 due to the negative performance of the Flame for Life division  impacted by a stronger than expected lighter market decline in the US  resulting from the deteriorating consumption trends. This was partially offset by strong growth in the rest of the world thanks to robust execution and distribution gains coupled with geographical expansion.Q2 2024 net sales decreased by 0.9% at constant currency3 driven by negative performance in North America  mainly impacted by the US market deterioration in our 3 divisions. This more than offset solid growth in other key regions. Human Expression net sales grew by 1.3% at constant currency3  driven by Europe and Middle East and Africa. The performance of Flame for Life improved in Q2  at -3.6% at constant currency2 (vs -7.8% in Q1 2024)  marked by a sequential improvement in the US and continued good performance in Europe and Brazil. In Blade Excellence  growth at constant currency3 in Q2 was negative at -1.0%  due to an unfavorable comparable basis (+16.8% in Q2 2023).H1 2024 gross profit margin was stable vs H1 2023 at 49.3% of net sales  totaling €562 million. Excluding the special bonus and the fair value adjustment on the Power Purchase Agreement in France4  H1 2024 gross profit margin increased by 60bps to 49.9%  driven by favorable price and mix  currency fluctuations and manufacturing efficiencies. This was partially offset by higher raw material costs notably in the lighter business and unfavorable fixed cost absorption.H1 2024 adjusted EBIT margin was flat compared to H1 2023  at 14.9%  amounting to €170 million. This resulted from gross profit margin improvement  offset by negative net sales operating leverage.Q2 2024 gross profit margin increased from 49.0% in Q2 2023 to 49.4% in Q2 2024. Excluding the fair value adjustment on the Power Purchase Agreement in France  Q2 2024 gross profit margin increased by 80bps to 50.2%  driven by favorable price and mix  currency fluctuations  and manufacturing efficiencies. This was partially offset by unfavorable fixed cost absorption.Q2 2024 adjusted EBIT margin was 17.4%  up by 90bps year-on-year  mainly due to gross profit margin improvement. Adjusted EBIT also improved in value  at €107 million (+2.1% vs Q2 2023).Key components of the change in adjusted EBIT marginKey components of the change in adjusted EBIT margin (in points) Q1 2024 vs. Q1 2023 Q2 2024 vs. Q2 2023 H1 2024 vs. H1 2023 · Change in Gross Profit* +0.5 +0.8 +0.6 · Brand Support (0.1) 0.0 0.0 · Operating expenses and other expenses* (1.4) +0.1 (0.6) Total change in Adjusted EBIT margin (1.0) +0.9 0.0* Excluding the special bonus in Q1 and France PPA in Q2Net income and earnings per share (EPS)in million euros Q2 2023 Q2 2024 H1 2023 H1 2024 EBIT 102.8 99.5 174.7 154.5 Finance revenue/costs (4.3) 8.0 (5.5) 0.2 Income before Tax 98.5 107.5 169.2 154.7 Net Income Group share 70.8 77.2 121.6 111.4 Adjusted Net Income Group Share 76.0 80.1 126.8 123.4 Adjusted EPS Group Share (in euros) 1.76 1.92 2.93 2.95 EPS Group Share (in euros) 1.64 1.85 2.81 2.67H1 2024 finance revenue/costs was at €0.2 million vs. -€5.5 million in H1 2023 mainly driven by the strong favorable impact of the fair value adjustments to financial assets denominated in US Dollar against the Brazilian Real in H1 2024.H1 2024 effective tax rate was 28.0% vs. 28.1% in H1 2023.Change in net cash positionChange in net cash position (in million euros) H1 2023 H1 2024 Net Cash position (as of end of December) 359.9 385.4 Net cash from operating activities +45.3 +68.5 · Of which operating cash flow +240.6 +228.0 · Of which change in working capital (154.8) (105.2) · Others5 (40.5) (54.3) Capital expenditures6 (42.8) (31.6) Dividend payment (110.2) (119.1) Share buyback program7 (60.4) (29.4) Net cash from the liquidity contract (0.8) (0.3) Other items +6.6 (11.7) Net Cash position (as of end of June) 197.6 261.8Operating Cash flow was €228 million resulting from good business performance. The €105 million negative change in working capital and others was mainly driven by higher trade and other receivables of €162 million linked to back-to-school seasonality. As a result  H1 2024 Free Cash Flow (before acquisitions and disposals) was €37 million.At the end of June 2024  Net Cash position was €262 million.Update on our 2025 Horizon Strategic PlanDuring H1 2024  we made progress on our 2025 Horizon strategic objectives:BIC continued to focus on solid execution and launch of innovative advertising campaigns including for the utility pocket lighter EZ Reach in Europe and in the US  and for the new utility lighter EZ Load in the US. In Brazil  we boosted our market presence with our Soleil Escape shaver communication plan as well as our latest iconic 4-Color pen campaign  both driving sales growth and solidifying our leadership positions.

Growth was fueled by all geographies and all channels  with strong distribution gains in both Western and Eastern Europe. BIC’s iconic 4-Color pen continued to be the main growth driver across Europe. The expansion of our distribution network towards discounters and eCommerce is particularly successful  with more products available in-store and a strong increase in demand for decorated and personalized products. Core products such as ball pen and correction also contributed to growth.In the US  net sales were impacted by negative market trends. However  this was partially offset by the performance from core products  notably Mechanical Pencils and Ball Pen  as well as added value products such as Gel. BIC maintained its market share in both volume and value  driven by eCommerce  in a market declining by 4.2% in value and 4.7% in volume8.In Latin America  net sales performance was solid in Mexico. Growth came from both core  such as Ball Pen  and added-value segments  such as Marking and Coloring. This was partially offset by a softer performance in Brazil due to a challenging competitive environment in the modern mass market.In Middle East and Africa  net sales grew strongly  notably driven by good performance of Lucky pen items in Nigeria  positive pricing and higher volumes in South Africa  as well as distribution gains in Kenya.In H1 2024  the Human Expression division’s adjusted EBIT margin increased by 170 bps to 11.4%  driven by significant gross profit improvement  with favorable pricing and mix  currency fluctuations  as well as lower brand support investments. This was partially offset by unfavorable fixed cost absorption and higher electricity costs.In Q2 2024  adjusted EBIT margin for the division improved by 40bps  at 15.3%  resulting from lower operating expenses and others and lower brand support investments. This was partially offset by unfavorable fixed cost absorption and higher electricity costs.Flame for Lifein million euros Q2 2023 Q2 2024 H1 2023 H1 2024 Volumes in million units - - 820 757 % change - - (3.6) % (7.7) % Net Sales 205.8 195.0 434.3 402.1 Change as reported (1.8) % (5.2) % (0.4) % (7.4) % Change on a constant currency basis excluding Argentina +0.9 % (3.6) % (0.9) % (5.8) % Change on a constant currency basis +2.8% (2.0) % +0.6% (3.8) % Adjusted EBIT 69.2 63.2 153.1 126.5 Adjusted EBIT Margin 33.6% 32.4% 35.3% 31.5%H1 2024 Flame for Life net sales decreased by 5.8% at constant currency excluding Argentina driven by market decline in the US  only partially offset by strong growth in Europe and Latin America.In Europe  net sales growth was solid  fueled by price  mix and volume. Product mix improved with decorated lighters and premium Djeep lighters both growing double-digit. We also expanded distribution  notably in the discounters’ channel. Additionally  BIC’s EZ Reach marketing campaigns started in H1 2024 in several countries including Greece  Italy  Poland or Ireland  resulting in strong net sales growth in those markets.In the US  net sales were negatively impacted by a stronger than expected market decline  due to the deterioration of consumption trends  particularly in the convenience channel. In an environment impacted by inflation and geopolitical uncertainties  consumers remain cautious on their spendings. However  we continued to focus on executing our trade-up strategy with the ramp up of our recently launched EZ Load utility lighter and the ongoing success of the EZ Reach utility pocket lighter.In Latin America  performance was solid in Brazil with strong execution and distribution gains in both pocket and utility lighters. EZ Reach continued to ramp-up helped by impactful digital campaigns  enabling BIC to increase its market share in the utility lighters segment.In H1 2024  the Flame for Life’s division adjusted EBIT margin was 31.5%  versus 35.3% in H1 2023. This decrease was mainly driven by higher raw material costs  unfavorable fixed cost absorption and negative net sales operating leverage in the US.In Q2 2024  the Flame for Life’s division adjusted EBIT margin was 32.4%  versus 33.6% in Q2 2023. This decrease was mainly driven by unfavorable fixed cost absorption and negative Net Sales operating leverage in the US.Blade Excellencein million euros Q2 2023 Q2 2024 H1 2023 H1 2024 Volumes in million units - - 1 255 1 271 % change - - +3.5% +1.2% Net Sales 143.6 138.5 268.3 271.0 Change as reported +13.3% (3.6) % +11.7% +1.0% Change on a constant currency basis excluding Argentina +16.8% (1.0) % +11.9% +3.5% Change on a constant currency basis +19.7% +3.2% +14.7% +10.1% Adjusted EBIT 14.8 24.5 20.5 38.3 Adjusted EBIT Margin 10.3% 17.7% 7.6% 14.1%H1 2024 Blade Excellence net sales grew by 3.5% at constant currency excluding Argentina  with most regions contributing to growth. This was nevertheless partially offset by North America soft performance.In Europe  BIC’s performance continued to be strong  and became the number 2 player in the wet shave market9. BIC successfully gained share in 9 out of 12 countries  boosted by its value for money proposition offering  appealing to consumers in an inflationary environment. BIC also continued to expand our footprint in Eastern Europe and in the discounters’ channel  driven by added-value products such as the BIC Hybrid Flex and BIC Click Soleil.In the US  despite the solid performance of key products such as Comfort 3  Flex 5 Hybrid and Soleil Escape  net sales were negatively impacted by a challenging consumer environment with demand contraction  affecting the disposable shaver market (down -3.3% in value and -3.0% in volume in H1)10.In Latin America  robust growth in Brazil was driven by the continued acceleration of the 3-blade segment (notably Soleil Escape  BIC Comfort 3 and BIC Flex 3) as well as our added-value Hybrid range  all supported by impactful communication campaigns and new listings at top customers.

The importance of adding alemtuzumab to the lymphodepletion regimen has been demonstrated in Cellectis’ BALLI-01 study  where the addition of this lymphodepletion agent to the fludarabine and cyclophosphamide regimen was associated with sustained lymphodepletion and significantly higher UCART22 cell expansion allowing for greater clinical activity ” said Mark Frattini  M.D.  Ph.D. Chief Medical Officer at Cellectis.Cellectis is the inventor of the combination of CD52 knockout UCART cells with a lymphodepleting regimen containing an anti-CD52 antibody such as alemtuzumab. The CD52 knockout aims to render the UCART product candidates resistant to alemtuzumab as part of the lymphodepleting regimen. Cellectis’ UCART22 product candidate has the CD52 gene inactivated by TALEN® gene editing technology.The FDA grants ODD status to medicines intended for the treatment  diagnosis or prevention of rare diseases or disorders that affect fewer than 200 000 people in the US. Receiving ODD may help to expedite and reduce the cost of development  approval  and commercialization of a therapeutic agent.About CellectisCellectis is a clinical-stage biotechnology company using its pioneering gene-editing platform to develop life-saving cell and gene therapies.

A new survey by Wolters Kluwer reveals that 33% of respondents representing small businesses that meet the reporting criteria and should be filing this year mistakenly don’t believe that beneficial ownership information (BOI) reporting applies to their organizations.While 39% acknowledge the applicability of the rule to their organizations  23% confessed their uncertainty on its relevance. When asked about the status of their BOI filing  16% have no intention of filing beneficial ownership details  rising to 36% among businesses with annual revenues below $500 000. A summary of the survey findings is available online.“One of the biggest takeaways from our survey is the disconnect among many small businesses about their eligibility status and intent to file BOI details by year-end ” said Rupak Venugopal  Vice President  Beneficial Ownership  Wolters Kluwer Financial & Corporate Compliance. “A significant portion of respondents mistakenly believe their organizations’ annual revenue or employee counts make them too small for eligibility. We strongly encourage all businesses to familiarize themselves with BOI reporting requirements and the specific exemptions listed by the CTA and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN).”Venugopal points to Wolters Kluwer’s Bizfilings Beneficial Ownership Eligibility Quiz as a means of helping small businesses quickly understand whether they need to file.Conducted June 21-July 1  the survey of 302 U.S. small businesses collected input from organizations with less than $5 million in annual revenues and fewer than 20 employees.The survey also explores the resources small businesses are tapping for BOI compliance  with law firms being relied upon three times more than CPA/accounting firms. Among the top sources cited in having helped generate awareness of the reporting rule among small businesses  law firms led (32%)  followed by websites (27%) and word-of-mouth (22%).Wolters Kluwer’s BizFilings Beneficial Ownership Information Report solution helps small businesses understand basic reporting requirements  file with confidence  and avoid penalties for non-compliance.For more information about Wolters Kluwer  please visit: www.wolterskluwer.com.About Wolters KluwerWolters Kluwer (EURONEXT: WKL) is a global leader in information  software solutions and services for professionals in healthcare; tax and accounting; financial and corporate compliance; legal and regulatory; corporate performance and ESG.

Following this conversion  TSGH’s ownership in Transgene will increase from 59.7% to 69.1%.Dr. Alessandro Riva  MD  Chairman and CEO of Transgene  commented: “The long-term support of our principal shareholder has been crucial in financing our research and development activities. This conversion allows us to strengthen our balance sheet by significantly reducing our debt and associated financing costs. With improved financial flexibility  we approach the second half of 2024 with the expectation of announcing significant progress and results across all our innovative immunotherapy programs.”In September 2023  Transgene signed a current account advance agreement with TSGH (Institut Mérieux) for €36 million  which was increased to a maximum of €66 million in March 2024. This current account advance bears interest at the average monthly rate of 3-month Euribor plus 1% per annum  up to the maximum tax-deductible rate. However  advances allocated for the offset of TSGH subscription to a capital increase of Transgene carried out before September 20  2024  are excluded from the basis for calculating interest. The company is able to use this financing as it requires until December 31  2025. For this reason  TSGH and Transgene have mutually agreed to proceed with the Reserved Capital Increase before the summer break.As of the date of the prospectus issued in conjunction with this transaction  Transgene has drawn €35.6 million from the current account advance. Following the Reserved Capital Increase  non-current financial debt and total net financial debt (based on cash and cash equivalents as of June 30  2024) will be €5.8 million and €(8.8) million  respectively  compared to €36.1 million and €21.5 million as of June 30  2024 (before the impact of this transaction). Transgene confirms its financial visibility until the fourth quarter of 2025.Michel Baguenault de Puchesse  Director of Transgene and CEO of Institut Mérieux  said: “Institut Mérieux is committed to supporting Transgene’s growth as an independent company. The conversion of outstanding debt under the existing current account advance underlines the strength of this long-term partnership. The promise of therapeutic cancer vaccines has never been greater  and we believe Transgene has the opportunity to become a key player in the field  with the potential to improve and extend the lives of many cancer patients through successful development of its pipeline.”Detailed description of the transactionNature and size of the transactionThe 30 898 876 new shares (the “New Shares”) will be issued as part of a share capital increase without shareholders’ preferential subscription rights reserved to TSGH SA (’TSGH’  a wholly-owned subsidiary of Institut Mérieux). This share capital increase (the “Reserved Share Capital Increase”) is carried out on the basis of the 23rd resolution of the Combined General Meeting of May 15  2024  and was authorized by Transgene’s Board of Directors on July 25  2024.The Reserved Share Capital Increase’s gross proceeds  including the issue premium  amount to 32 999 999.57 euros  i.e. 15 449 438.00 euros of nominal amount and 17 550 561.57 euros of issue premium.The issue price of 1.068 euro per New Share (i.e. 0.50 euro par value and 0.568 euro issue premium) corresponds to the last closing price of the Company’s shares on Euronext Paris prior to the determination of the issue price.The New Shares will be ordinary shares of the same class as the Company’s existing shares (the “Existing Shares”). They will be admitted to trading on the regulated market of Euronext in Paris (“Euronext Paris”) as soon as they are issued and will be immediately assimilated to the Company’s Existing Shares  which are already traded on Euronext Paris (Compartment C). They will be traded from that date on the same quotation line as those shares under the same ISIN code (FR0005175080).As the New Shares represent more than 20% of Transgene’s share capital  their admission to trading is subject to a prospectus which will be submitted to the Autorité des Marchés Financiers (the “AMF”) for approval. This prospectus will consist of:Transgene’s universal registration document filed with the AMF on April 12  2024  under number D.24-0274;an amendment to the universal registration document  which will be filed with the AMF on July 31  2024;a securities note to be drawn up in accordance with Annex 11 of Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/980 of 14 March 2019  as amended; anda summary of the prospectus (which will be included in the securities note).The information contained in the prospectus will maintain  in all material respects and to the extent necessary  equal access between the various shareholders and investors to the information relating to Transgene.Copies of the prospectus will be available free of charge at the registered office of Transgene  400 boulevard Gonthier d’Andernach—Parc d’Innovation  67400 Illkirch-Graffenstaden  France as well as on the websites of (i) Transgene and (ii) of AMF.Background and reason for the transactionAs indicated above  the Reserved Share Capital Increase corresponds to the capitalization of a fraction (32 999 999.57 euros out of the 35.6 million euros outstanding as of the date of this press release) of the current account advance (the “Current Account Advance”) granted by TSGH to Transgene.The Current Account Advance was granted pursuant to a current account advance agreement entered into on 20 September 2023 (the “Current Account Advance Agreement”). Its initial amount was 36 million euros and was increased to 66 million euros by an amendment signed on March 27  2024. The Current Account Advance Agreement provides that TSGH may use the sums advanced to pay up all or part of the subscription price of a share capital increase by the Company.The Current Account Advance bears interest at the average monthly rate of 3-month Euribor plus 1% per year  up to the maximum tax-deductible rate  it being understood that sums advanced which are capitalized before September 20  2024  will not bear interest.Drawdowns on the Current Account Advance amounted to 12.9 million euros from September 2023 to the end of 2023  20.0 million euros during the first half of 2024 (bringing the total amount drawn on June 30  2024  to 32.9 million euros)  and 2.7 million euros in July 2024  bringing the total amount drawn to 35.6 million euros. Completion of the Reserved Share Capital Increase will reduce this amount to 2.6 million euros.TSGH and Transgene have entered today into a debt compensation agreement in which TSGH has undertaken to subscribe to all of the New Shares for a subscription amount (issue premium included) of 32 999 999.57 million euros  by set-off with the same amount of the Current Account Advance. The amount of the Current Account Advance thus capitalized has been certified by the Company’s statutory auditors in accordance with Article R. 225-134 of the French Commercial Code. In accordance with Article L. 225-146  paragraph 2 of the French Commercial Code  the statutory auditors will also produce the certificate which will constitute the depositary’s certificate. Finally  the statutory auditors will draw up a supplementary report within fifteen days of the date of completion of the Reserved Share Capital Increase.Indicative timetableJuly 25  2024 Decision of the Board of Directors setting the indicative terms of the Reserved Capital Increase July 30  2024 Decision of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer setting the definitive terms of the Reserved Capital Increase Publication of this press release July 31  2024 Approval of the prospectus by the AMF Publication of the press release announcing the availability of the prospectus July 31/August 1st  2024 Euronext notice of admission of the New Shares to trading on Euronext Paris August 1st  2024 Completion Date Issue of the New Shares to TSGH Admission of the New Shares to trading on Euronext Paris September 24  2024 (after the close of trading) Publication of 2024 half-year results and financial reportGross and net amounts and use of proceedsThe gross proceeds of the Reserved Share Capital Increase  issue premium included  is 32 999 999.57 euros. It will be used to repay the Current Account Advance. In these circumstances  the concept of net proceeds is not relevant  as it does not correspond to an inflow of cash.The amount of the Current Account Advance at the date of this press release (35.6 million euros excluding interest)  including the capitalized portion (32 999 999.57 euros) has been used to obtain clinical data on the products in development and to finance the acceleration of the clinical development of the innovative immunotherapy platforms from September 2023 to June 2024. Specifically:to finalize and obtain additional data from a Phase I study of TG4050 in head and neck cancers – data presented in April at the AACR 2024 – next clinical data expected in the second half (H2) of 2024; for the preparation and launch of a Phase II trial with TG4050 in head and neck cancers – First patient included early June 2024; for preliminary work prior to the launch of a Phase 1 trial of TG4050 in a new indication and the first steps in a development strategy towards a partnership or possible commercialization; to complete the Phase II trial of TG4001 in anogenital cancers and obtain final data – Enrolment completed in the first quarter of 2024 and topline data expected in H2 2024; for the continuation of the two Phase I trials of BT-001 in solid tumors and of TG6050 in lung cancer – Clinical results are expected for these two oncolytic viruses in H2 2024; for preclinical work on a new generation of therapeutic vaccines targeting shared antigens and a new generation of “synthetic” oncolytic viruses; and for the remaining  to finance  together with Transgene’s operating revenues  working capital and ongoing R&D and operating expenses.Over the period between September 2023 and June 2024 referred to above  approximately 78% of the Company’s expenditure was allocated to points (1) to (6) above (and predominantly focused on work related to TG4050 and TG4001)  with the remaining amount allocated to point (7). The reader’s attention is drawn to the fact that the Company has resources other than the Current Account Advance and that this percentage does not correspond to a breakdown of the sums advanced under the Current Account Advance over this period.Breakdown of the share capitalAt the date of this press release  Transgene’s share capital amounted to €50 697 528.00  divided into 101 395 056 ordinary shares with a par value of €0.50  fully subscribed and paid up.

In accordance with the provisions of article L. 233-8 of the French Commercial Code  Transgene publishes monthly (to the extent that the information has changed since the last monthly publication) the total number of shares and voting rights on the AMF website and on its website www.transgene.fr. At the date of this press release  the total number of shares is 101 395 056 and the total theoretical number of voting rights is 167 276 684 of which 166 938 882 exercisable voting rights. There are no restrictions on voting rights.

The total percentage held by employees is less than 2%. As it is not significant  Transgene does not monitor employee share ownership. To the best of Transgene’s knowledge  there are no concert parties or agreements between shareholders.* Formerly “Dassault Belgique aviation”.Risk FactorsRisk factors relating to Transgene are described in Section 2 “Risk Factors” of Transgene’s 2023 Universal Registration Document.The main risk factors relating to the New Shares are as follows:The share capital increase is reserved for TSGH only  and the Company’s other shareholders will therefore suffer capital dilution as a result of the issue of New Shares (thus  a shareholder holding 1% of the capital before the Reserved Sare Capital Increase would hold 0.77 % of the capital after its completion); they will suffer further dilution in the event that the Company carries out a new share capital increase without shareholders’ preferential subscription rights reserved for TSGH; andThe price  volatility and liquidity of the Company’s shares could fluctuate significantly as a result of market trends and/or sales of shares.OtherThe issue of the New Shares has not been underwritten by a banking syndicate. The Reserved Share Capital Increase is subject to a subscription undertaking by TSGH. This underwriting commitment covers the entire issue. However  this commitment does not constitute a firm underwriting within the meaning of Article L. 225-145 of the French Commercial Code. There are no standstill or lock-up commitments.***About TransgeneTransgene (Euronext: TNG) is a biotechnology company focused on designing and developing targeted immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer.
