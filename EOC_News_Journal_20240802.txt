(“Pharming” or “the Company”) (Euronext Amsterdam: PHARM/Nasdaq: PHAR) presents its preliminary (unaudited) financial report for the second quarter and first half year ended June 30  2024.,Second quarter 2024 total revenues increased by 35% to US$74.1 million  compared to the second quarter 2023  driven by strong RUCONEST® and Joenja® revenue growthRUCONEST® second quarter revenue increased by 23% to US$63.0 million  compared to the second quarter 2023Joenja® (leniolisib) second quarter revenue increased by 16% to US$11.1 million  compared to the first quarter 2024First half total revenues increased by 33% to US$129.7 million  compared to the first half 2023On track for 2024 total revenue guidance of US$280 million - US$295 million (14 - 20% growth)Overall cash and marketable securities declined to US$161.8 million at the end of the second quarter 2024 from US$203.5 million at the end of the first quarter 2024  primarily due to convertible bond refinancingPharming to host a conference call today at 13:30 CEST (7:30 am EDT)Leiden  the Netherlands  August 1  2024: Pharming Group N.V. (“Pharming” or “the Company”) (Euronext Amsterdam: PHARM/Nasdaq: PHAR) presents its preliminary (unaudited) financial report for the second quarter and first half year ended June 30  2024.Chief Executive Officer  Sijmen de Vries  commented:“Pharming has delivered another strong quarter of revenue growth  increasing quarterly revenues by 35% to US$74.1 million. We are firmly on track to meet our 2024 total revenue guidance of US$280 million - US$295 million. We also narrowed our operating loss on a like for like basis compared to the second quarter of the prior year.RUCONEST® performed particularly strongly  with second quarter revenue increasing by 23% compared to 2Q 2023  and we have seen continued strength in underlying demand as well as a growing number of new patient enrollments.A year after the U.S. launch of Joenja®  the number of new patients on therapy is increasing quarter-on-quarter  with an increase of eight patients this quarter compared to two in the first quarter  and we are seeing high adherence rates for patients on paid therapy. Our patient finding and family testing efforts are continuing to help get new patients diagnosed  and we have seen positive early results on Variant of Uncertain Significance (VUS) reclassifications which suggest a significant increase in the identified APDS patient population in the US. We continue to work with regulatory authorities worldwide to make Joenja® (leniolisib) available to as many patients as possible  and expect a decision on the Marketing Authorisation Application from the UK MHRA in the fourth quarter. While we were disappointed by the delay to the European marketing authorisation  we are continuing to work closely with the EMA and CHMP  and are pleased that the CHMP determined the clinical benefit of leniolisib to be positive.As we work to expand the leniolisib market opportunity to other primary immunodeficiency (PID) disorders  we will initiate the Phase II proof-of-concept clinical trial in PIDs with immune dysregulation linked to PI3Kẟ signaling in the third quarter. We are also continuing to prepare a clinical development plan for a third PID indication.We expect this positive momentum to continue for the rest of the year  and I would like to thank all our employees for their significant achievements in the first half.”Second quarter and first half highlightsCommercialized assetsRUCONEST® marketed for the treatment of acute HAE attacksRUCONEST® continued to perform well in the second quarter of 2024  with revenue of US$63.0 million  a 23% increase compared to the second quarter of 2023. Revenue for the first half of 2024 was US$109.0 million  a 16% increase compared to the same period in 2023.The U.S. market contributed 96% of second quarter revenues  while the EU and Rest of World contributed 4%.In the U.S. market  we saw continued strength in the second quarter in underlying in-market demand for RUCONEST®  including over 100 new patient enrollments. We achieved strong overall performance in the second quarter in other leading key revenue indicators including new physicians prescribing RUCONEST® and the total number of patients on therapy. Increasing enrollments helped to drive a sharp increase in unique patient shipments in the second quarter.Joenja® (leniolisib) marketed in the U.S. - the first and only approved disease modifying treatment for APDSJoenja® revenues increased to US$11.1 million in the second quarter of 2024  a 16% increase compared to the first quarter of 2024 and a 192% increase compared to the second quarter of 2023. This increase was mostly driven by higher volume from the continued increase in patients on paid therapy in the U.S.  higher adherence rates for patients on paid therapy  and revenues from EU and Rest of World. Revenue for the first half of 2024 was US$20.7 million  compared to US$3.8 million for the same period in 2023.As of June 30  2024  we have 91 patients on paid therapy in the U.S. and an additional two patients enrolled and pending authorization  representing an increase of eight patients on paid therapy during the second quarter as compared to an increase of two patients during the first quarter.EU and Rest of World revenues are from product provided on a named patient basis. Pharming has named patient and other funded early access programs in certain countries where leniolisib is not commercially available: physicians can request leniolisib on behalf of individual patients living with APDS who meet the eligibility criteria and receive local health authority approval.APDS patient findingAs of June 30  2024  Pharming had identified over 870 diagnosed APDS patients of all ages in global markets  including over 230 patients in the U.S. Of the identified patients in the U.S.  over 150 patients are 12 years of age or older and eligible for treatment with Joenja®. Over 780 of these globally identified patients are in target markets for Pharming in the U.S.  Europe  the U.K.  Japan  Asia Pacific  Middle East  Latin America and Canada  with estimated total prevalence of approximately 2 400 APDS patients.Pharming continues to advance several initiatives to diagnose additional APDS patients  including a sponsored genetic testing program in the U.S. and Canada  partnerships with several genetic testing companies who undertake their own testing efforts  and family testing programs.Pharming’s Variant of Uncertain Significance (VUS) resolution efforts are ongoing  including validation studies with various laboratories to confirm which VUSs can be classified as APDS. As results become available  patients with validated variants could be diagnosed with APDS and  therefore  potentially be eligible for Joenja® treatment. Completion of the in vitro high throughput screening study is expected during the fourth quarter of 2024.In the U.S. market  the number of diagnosed APDS patients increased by 10 during the second quarter 2024.APDS patient finding - VUS resolutionPharming has identified approximately 1 200 patients in the U.S. with a VUS in the PIK3CD or PIK3R1 genes and is performing validation studies with various laboratories to confirm which of these variants are pathogenic for APDS. Patients with disease-associated variants would receive a molecular diagnosis of APDS and  therefore  potentially be eligible for Joenja® treatment. Based on data from Pharming’s navigateAPDS sponsored genetic testing program  PIK3CD and PIK3R1 VUSs are found at four times the frequency of pathogenic / likely pathogenic variants classified as APDS.A literature review  which includes more than 1.5 million patients  showed that 20% of reclassified VUSs are upgraded to likely pathogenic / pathogenic. Pharming also recently completed a pilot study with 25 patients with a VUS who then underwent further testing of the PI3K-AkT-mTOR pathway  and results were consistent  with VUS reclassifications to APDS for five of these patients.Together  these data suggest that there could be a significant increase in the number of APDS patients in the US once those patients with a VUS are reclassified.Pharming is expanding the pilot study to allow additional patients with a VUS to be tested  and the data generated are being shared with central databases (ClinVar) and genetic testing labs so that the same variants found in the future may be classified correctly without need for further testing.Additionally  Pharming is working with researchers to be able to evaluate large numbers of VUSs without the need for additional patient testing. VUS resolution via high throughput screening methods is a common approach and is accepted as strong evidence by various expert organizations including the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) and ClinGen (a National Institutes of Health-funded resource). An initial evaluation of this approach has recently been published and confirmed the ability to differentiate benign vs. pathogenic variants  and identified new pathogenic variants. Full results from this study are on track to be available by the end of 2024.Joenja® (leniolisib) strategic highlights - regulatory  clinical and commercial strategy updatesLeniolisib for APDSPharming made continued progress in the second quarter of 2024 on leniolisib regulatory filings for APDS patients 12 years of age and older in key global markets. In addition  Pharming progressed ongoing clinical trials to support regulatory filings for approval in Japan and pediatric label expansion.Pharming’s strategy is to expand the commercial availability of leniolisib for APDS patients to key markets in Europe  U.K.  Japan  Asia Pacific  Middle East  Latin America and Canada. Pharming intends to market leniolisib directly in most of these markets following regulatory approval.In total  there are currently 150 patients in a leniolisib Expanded Access Program (compassionate use)  an ongoing clinical study  or a named patient program.European Economic Area (EEA)As announced on May 30  2024  the European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) Committee for Human Medicinal Products (CHMP) issued an updated List of Outstanding Issues (LoOI) regarding the leniolisib Marketing Authorisation Application (MAA). The LoOI affirmed the positive clinical benefit and safety of leniolisib  in agreement with the assessment by the Ad Hoc Expert Group (AEG)  and included one remaining chemistry  manufacturing and controls (CMC) request. The CMC request relates to the definition of regulatory starting materials used in the manufacturing process for leniolisib. The CHMP requested that this work be completed pre-approval and granted Pharming an extension to January 2026 to submit a response. Pharming plans to complete the manufacturing activities requested by the CHMP and submit a response prior to this deadline.United KingdomOn March 12  2024  Pharming submitted an MAA for leniolisib with the U.K. Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA)  through the International Recognition Procedure (IRP) on the basis of the U.S. FDA approval. The MAA for leniolisib was validated on April 17  2024. Pharming received the MHRA Day 70 Request for Further Information on July 3  2024. There were no major objections. Upon Pharming’s satisfactory response to MHRA requests  it is expected that the MHRA will issue its decision in the fourth quarter of 2024.Additional markets - CanadaPharming filed a regulatory submission in Canada for leniolisib for APDS in the third quarter of 2023. Pharming recently submitted a response to a Health Canada Notice of Deficiency in July 2024. Pharming is awaiting feedback on next steps but no longer anticipates regulatory approval in 2024.Leniolisib for additional indications (PI3Kδ platform) - Primary immunodeficiencies (PIDs) beyond APDSPharming is planning a Phase II  proof of concept  clinical trial in targeted PID genetic disorders with immune dysregulation linked to PI3Kẟ signaling in lymphocytes  with similar clinical phenotypes to APDS. These PID disorders include ALPS-FAS  CTLA4 haploinsufficiency and PTEN deficiency. The epidemiology of these targeted PID genetic disorders suggests a prevalence of approximately five patients per million.The Phase II clinical trial is a single arm  open-label  dose range-finding study to be conducted in approximately 12 patients. The objectives for the trial will be to assess safety and tolerability  pharmacokinetics  pharmacodynamics  and explore clinical efficacy of leniolisib in the targeted PID population. The trial has been designed to inform a subsequent Phase III program. Pharming is in the final stages of preparation for the start of the trial  which it expects to initiate shortly.Pharming has also prioritized development of leniolisib for an additional PID indication. Pharming will provide further updates and details on our plans after obtaining regulatory feedback on the proposed clinical development plan.Financial SummaryConsolidated Statement of Income 2Q 2024 2Q 2023 1H 2024 1H 2023 Amounts in US$m except per share data Total Revenues 74.1 54.9 129.7 97.4 Cost of sales (8.0) (5.7) (16.4) (9.8) Gross profit 66.1 49.2 113.3 87.6 Other income 0.9 21.9 1.3 22.5 Research and development (21.6) (20.9) (40.1) (36.5) General and administrative (15.6) (11.0) (30.7) (21.0) Marketing and sales (32.9) (33.9) (63.2) (61.0) Other Operating Costs (70.1) (65.8) (134.0) (118.5) Operating profit (loss) (3.1) 5.3 (19.4) (8.4) Fair value gain (loss) on revaluation 5.1 — 5.1 — Other finance income 1.2 0.7 2.9 0.8 Other finance expenses (2.9) (2.5) (4.5) (5.2) Share of net profits in associates using the equity method (0.4) (0.1) (0.8) (0.5) Profit (loss) before tax (0.1) 3.4 (16.7) (13.3) Income tax credit (expense) (1.1) (2.1) 3.0 2.4 Profit (loss) for the period (1.2) 1.3 (13.7) (10.9) Share Information Basic earnings per share (US$) (0.002) 0.002 (0.020) (0.017) Diluted earnings per share (US$) (0.002) 0.002 (0.020) (0.017)Segment information - Revenues 2Q 2024 2Q 2023 1H 2024 1H 2023 Amounts in US$m Revenue - RUCONEST® (US) 61.6 50.2 106.4 90.9 Revenue - RUCONEST® (EU and RoW) 1.4 0.9 2.6 2.7 Total Revenues - RUCONEST® 63.0 51.1 109.0 93.6 Revenue - Joenja® (US) 10.2 3.8 18.7 3.8 Revenue - Joenja® (EU and RoW) 0.9 — 2.0 — Total Revenues - Joenja® 11.1 3.8 20.7 3.8 Total Revenues - US 71.8 54.0 125.1 94.7 Total Revenues - EU and RoW 2.3 0.9 4.6 2.7 Total Revenues 74.1 54.9 129.7 97.4Consolidated Balance Sheet June 30  2024 December 31  2023 Amounts in US$m Cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash and marketable securities 161.8 215.0 Current assets 270.6 316.3 Total assets 415.9 462.9 Current liabilities 79.9 78.0 Equity 220.9 218.8Financial highlightsSecond quarter 2024For the second quarter of 2024  revenues increased by US$19.2 million  or 35%  to US$74.1 million  compared to US$54.9 million in the second quarter of 2023. RUCONEST® revenues amounted to US$63.0 million  a 23% increase compared to the second quarter of 2023. The volume increase in the U.S.  and a U.S. price increase in line with CPI  were the primary factors behind this increase in RUCONEST® revenues. Joenja® revenues amounted to US$11.1 million in the second quarter of 2024  a 16% increase compared to the first quarter of 2024 and a 192% increase compared to the second quarter of 2023. This increase in Joenja® revenues was primarily driven by an increase in volume.Gross profit increased by US$16.9 million or 34% to US$66.1 million (2Q 2023: US$49.2 million)  mainly due to the increase in revenues.Other income decreased to US$0.9 million compared to US$21.9 million in the second quarter of 2023. Other income in the second quarter of 2023 was supported by the sale of the Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher (PRV) to Novartis for a pre-agreed  one-time payment of US$21.1 million.The operating loss amounted to US$3.1 million compared to an operating profit of US$5.3 million in the second quarter of 2023. In addition to the support in gross profit and other income mentioned above  this change was mainly due to an expected increase in operating expenses from US$65.8 million in the second quarter of 2023 to US$70.1 million in the second quarter of this year. The second quarter 2023 operating expenses included milestone payments for Joenja® amounting to US$10.5 million. The increase in operating expenses was caused by a combination of continuing investments in Joenja® in the U.S.  launch preparation for leniolisib outside of the U.S.  increasing R&D investments to expand the leniolisib franchise and increased payroll expenses due to business growth. Excluding the proceeds from the PRV sale and the milestone payment expenses for Joenja® in the second quarter of 2023  the operating loss decreased from US$5.3 million to US$3.1 million in the second quarter of the current year.The net finance result amounted to a gain of US$3.4 million compared to a loss of US$1.8 million in the second quarter of 2023. This was primarily driven by a fair value gain of US$5.1 million upon the reclassification of the convertible bond-related derivative to equity. This fair value gain was a result of the decrease in value of the option component classified as a derivative from issuance until the physical settlement date of the newly issued convertible bond. For more information on the matter  reference is made to Note 18. Convertible bonds of the Notes to the condensed consolidated interim financial statements of this press release. This fair value gain is tax exempt  resulting in a favorable income tax credit.The Company had a net loss of US$1.2 million  compared to a net profit of US$1.3 million in the second quarter of 2023. In addition to the support in other income from the PRV sale and the milestone payments for Joenja® in the second quarter of 2023  the change was mainly due to an increase in operating expenses  offset by an increase in revenues and the fair value gain upon the reclassification of the convertible bond-related derivative to equity.Cash and cash equivalents  including restricted cash and marketable securities  decreased from US$203.5 million at the end of first quarter of 2024 to US$161.8 million at the end of the second quarter of 2024. This decrease was primarily driven by the repurchase of the outstanding convertible bonds amounting to US$134.9 million  offset by net proceeds of US$104.8 million for newly issued convertible bonds. In addition  the decrease was accompanied by a US$12.4 million increase in receivables in the second quarter of 2024  resulting from higher revenues.First half year 2024Total revenues increased 33% during the first half of 2024 to US$129.7 million  versus US$97.4 million during the first half of 2023. For the first half of 2024  total RUCONEST® revenues were 16% higher at US$109.0 million  compared to revenues of US$93.6 million for the first half of 2023. Joenja® revenues amounted to US$20.7 million in the first half of 2024  a 44% increase compared to the second half of 2023. This increase in Joenja® revenues was primarily driven by an increase in volume.Gross profit increased by US$25.7 million or 29% to US$113.3 million (1H 2023: US$87.6 million)  mainly due to the increase in revenues.Further details on revenue and gross profit segmentation is provided in Note 7. Segment information in the Notes to the condensed consolidated interim financial statements of this press release.Other income decreased to US$1.3 million compared to US$22.5 million in the first half of 2023. Other income in the first half of 2023 was supported by the sale of the Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher (PRV) to Novartis for a pre-agreed  one-time payment of US$21.1 million.The operating loss amounted to US$19.4 million compared to an operating loss of US$8.4 million in the first half of 2023. In addition to the support in gross profit and other income mentioned above  this change was mainly due to an expected increase in operating expenses from US$118.5 million in the first half of 2023 to US$134.0 million in the first half of this year. The second quarter 2023 operating expenses included milestone payments for Joenja® amounting to US$10.5 million. The increase in operating expenses was caused by a combination of continuing investments in Joenja® in the U.S.  launch preparation for leniolisib outside of the U.S.  increasing R&D investments to expand the leniolisib franchise and increased payroll expenses due to business growth. Excluding the proceeds from the PRV sale and the milestone payment expenses for Joenja® in the first half of 2023  the operating loss increased from US$19.0 million to US$19.4 million in the first half of the current year.The net finance result amounted to a gain of US$3.6 million compared to a loss of US$4.5 million in the first half of 2023.

In addition  EUR/USD exchange rate developments led to a foreign currency gain of US$0.2 million compared to a loss of US$2.3 million in the first half of 2023.The Company had a net loss of US$13.7 million  compared to a net loss of US$10.9 million in the first half of 2023. In addition to the support in other income from the PRV and the milestone payments for Joenja® in the first half of 2023  the change was mainly due to an increase in revenues  favorable EUR/USD exchange rate developments and the fair value gain upon the reclassification of the convertible bond-related derivative to equity  offset by an increase in operating expenses.Cash and cash equivalents  including restricted cash and marketable securities  decreased from US$215.0 million at the end of 2023 to US$161.8 million at the end of the first half of 2024. This decrease was primarily driven by the repurchase of the outstanding convertible bonds amounting to US$134.9 million  offset by net proceeds of US$104.8 million for newly issued convertible bonds  and negative cash flows from operations amounting to US$20.9 million.On 5 October 2023  Orchard Therapeutics Plc. (Orchard) announced it had entered into a definitive agreement with Japanese company Kyowa Kirin Co. LTD for the acquisition of Orchard. During the first half of 2024  Pharming received US$2.0 million in cash for its shares held in Orchard. Pharming has terminated the research collaboration & licensing agreement with Orchard Therapeutics and discontinued the OTL-105 program.Outlook/SummaryFor 2024  the Company anticipates:Total revenues between US$280 million and US$295 million (14% to 20% growth)  with quarterly fluctuations expected.Continued progress finding additional APDS patients in the U.S.  supported by family testing and VUS validation efforts  and subsequently converting patients to paid Joenja® (leniolisib) therapy.Increasing ex-U.S. revenues leniolisib - from commercial availability or through our Named Patient Program and other funded early access programs in key global markets.Completion of leniolisib clinical trials to support regulatory filings for approval in Japan and pediatric label expansion in key global markets.Progress towards regulatory approvals for leniolisib in the EEA  the U.K.  Canada and Australia.Initiate and advance a Phase II clinical trial for leniolisib in PIDs with immune dysregulation linked to PI3Kδ signaling to significantly expand the long-term commercial potential of leniolisib.Continued operating cost investments to accelerate future revenue growth.

Company informationPharming Group N.V. is a limited liability public company which is listed on Euronext Amsterdam (PHARM) and on the NASDAQ (PHAR)  with its headquarters and registered office located at:Darwinweg 242333 CR LeidenThe Netherlands2. Statement of complianceThe consolidated interim financial statements for the six-month period ended June 30  2024  have been prepared in accordance with International Accounting Standard IAS 34  Interim financial reporting. The condensed consolidated interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the annual financial statements for the year ended December 31  2023  which have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (EU-IFRS) and IFRS interpretations committee (IFRS IC) interpretations applicable to companies reporting under IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and valid as of the balance sheet date.These condensed consolidated interim financial statements were authorized for issue by the Board of Directors on July 31  2024.The published figures in these condensed consolidated interim financial statements are unaudited.3. Accounting policiesAccounting policies are consistent with those of the financial statements for the year ended December 31  2023. The following EUR/USD exchange rates have been applied:EUR/USD exchange rate 1H 2024 2023 1H 2023 Period-end 1.0760 1.1002 1.0843 Average 1.0795 1.0790 1.07904. Estimates and judgementsThe preparation of interim financial statements in conformity with IAS 34 and Book 2 Title 9 of the Dutch Civil Code requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Company’s accounting policies. In preparing these condensed consolidated interim financial statements  the significant judgements made by management in applying the Company’s accounting policies were the same as those applied to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31  2023.5. Going concernIn preparing and finishing the interim financial statements the Board of Directors of Pharming have assessed the Company’s ability to fund its operations for a period of at least twelve months after the date the interim financial statements are issued. Based upon the assessment on a going concern basis  the Company has concluded that funding of its operations for a period of twelve months  after the date the interim financial statements are issued  is realistic and achievable. Overall  based on the outcome of this assessment  the interim financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis.6. Seasonality of operationsSeasonality has no material impact on Company’s interim financial statements.7. Segment informationOperating segments are components of the Company that engage in business activities from which it may incur expenses  for which discrete financial information is available and whose operating results are evaluated regularly by the Company’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance. The Executive Members of the Board of Directors are considered the CODM.CODM reviews the Company’s results under four operating segments based on a combination of the products that the Company has launched - RUCONEST® and Joenja®  and the main geographies where sales are consummated - focused on the US and reporting  in aggregate  EU and Rest of the World (“RoW”). The four operating segments correspond to each of its four reportable segments for financial reporting purposes.The CODM reviews revenues and gross profit to assess the performance of their operating segments. The CODM does not review financial information on a segmental basis below gross margin  and balance sheet information is not allocated to the company's reportable segments. There are no intersegment sales.Total revenues and gross profit per each operating and reportable segment for the period ended June 30 are:Amounts in US$ ‘000 1H 2024 1H 2023 RUCONEST® Joenja® Total RUCONEST® Joenja® Total Revenues: US 106 354 18 657 125 011 91 032 3 792 94 824 EU and RoW 2 619 2 049 4 668 2 614 — 2 614 Total revenues 108 973 20 706 129 679 93 646 3 792 97 438 Gross profit: US 94 445 16 203 110 648 83 547 3 317 86 864 EU and RoW 865 1 799 2 664 775 — 775 Total gross profit 95 310 18 002 113 312 84 322 3 317 87 6398. Other incomeOther income decreased by US$21.3 million in the first half of 2024 to US$1.3 million as compared to US$22.5 million the first half of 2023. The main reason was the gain on the sale of a Priority Review Voucher (PRV) to Novartis as part of the license agreement (US$21.3 million) in 2023.9. Expenses by natureCosts of salesAmounts in US$ ‘000 1H 2024 1H 2023 Cost of inventories recognized as expenses (10 738) (8 425) Royalty fees (2 502) (455) Obsolete inventory impairments (3 127) (919) Total (16 367) (9 799)Costs of inventories recognized as expenses in the first half year of 2024 were US$10.7 million versus US$8.4 million for the first half of 2023 and relates to actual product sales of RUCONEST® and Joenja®.Pharming expensed royalty fees to Novartis on Joenja® sales  amounting to US$2.5 million in the first half of 2024 (first half of 2023: US$0.5 million).Obsolete inventory impairments amounted to US$3.1 million (1H 2023: US$0.9 million) and stems from the valuation of the inventories against lower net realizable value and mainly relates to products no longer eligible for commercial sales.Other operating costsOther operating costs increased to US$134.0 million in the first half of 2024 compared to US$118.5 million in the first half year of 2023.Employee benefits are charged to research and development costs  general and administrative costs  or marketing and sales costs based on the nature of the services provided. Employee benefits of production related employees have been included in the value of inventories.Depreciation and amortization charges amounted to US$5.6 million in the first half of 2024 compared to US$5.5 million the first half year of 2023  and related to the following:Amounts in US$ ‘000 1H 2024 1H 2023 Property  plant and equipment (763) (713) Right-of-use assets (1 728) (1 809) Intangible assets (3 137) (2 946) Total (5 628) (5 468)10.

The euro got stronger during the first half of 2024 where it weakened during the first half of 2023. This impacts the revaluation of the bank balances in US dollars incorporated in euro functional currency entities and the receivables and payables in euro incorporated in our USD functional currency entity.Since the second quarter of 2023  the Company has used excess cash to invest in euro denominated readily convertible S&P AAA-rated government treasury certificates with a maturity of six months or less from the date of acquisition. As a result of these purchases  the interest income has increased significantly compared to 2023.11. Income tax (expenses)Income tax expenses are recognized in each interim period based on the best estimate of the weighted average annual income tax rate expected for the full financial year.12. InvestmentsInvestments accounted for using the equity methodThe asset relates to an investment in the ordinary shares of BioConnection Investments B.V. In the Board of Directors’ judgement  the investment in BioConnection constitutes an investment in an associated company and is therefore not consolidated. Pharming has significant influence but does not have control of BioConnection and is embargoed by a shareholder’s agreement between the shareholders of BioConnection from influencing any activity between the two parties which is in any significant way different from the relationship which existed between the two prior to the investment.The carrying amount of this investment has changed as follows:Amounts in US $ ‘000 Period toJune 30  2024 Period toDecember 31  2023 Balance at January 1 2 285 2 501 Share in net profit (loss) for the period (834) (289) Currency translation (47) 73 Balance at end of period 1 404 2 285Investment in debt instruments designated as at FVTPLThe asset relates to the preference share in BioConnection Investments B.V. The Board of Directors made an assessment on the accounting treatment of the preference share obtained. The Board concluded that the asset should be recognized as a financial asset (debt instrument) measured at initial recognition at fair value  subsequently measured at fair value through profit and loss. The fair value is calculated on a yearly basis using the forward-looking Black-Scholes-Merton (“BSM”) financial instrument pricing framework. No events or matters are known as of the date of this report which would lead to a significant impact in the fair value of the asset  compared to December 31  2023.The carrying amount of this investment has changed as follows:Amounts in US $ ‘000 Period toJune 30  2024 Period toDecember 31  2023 Balance at January 1 6 093 6 827 Fair value changes — (930) Currency translation (134) 196 Balance at end of period 5 959 6 093Investment in equity instruments designated as at FVTOCIThe Group held 0.54 per cent of the ordinary share capital of Orchard Therapeutics  a global gene therapy leader per December 31  2023.On 5 October 2023  Orchard announced it had entered into a definitive agreement with Japanese company Kyowa Kirin Co.

Convertible bondsIn April 2024  the Company offered €100 million (US$108 million) of senior unsecured convertible bonds due 2029 (the “New Bonds”) convertible into new and/or existing ordinary shares in the capital of the Company. The offer was fully subscribed. The net proceeds of the issue of the bonds were used for the repurchase of the outstanding €125 million (US$135 million) 3.00% senior unsecured convertible bonds due 2025 issued on 21 January 2020 (ISIN: XS2105716554)  which has been launched concurrently to the offering of the New Bonds to strengthen its financial position while enhancing flexibility for the continued execution of its business strategy over the next several years.The New Bonds have a principal amount of €100 000 each. The New Bonds are issued at par and carry a coupon of 4.50% per annum payable semi-annually in arrears in equal installments on 25th April and 25th October of each year  commencing on 25th October 2024. Unless previously converted  redeemed or purchased and cancelled  the New Bonds will be redeemed at par on 25th April 2029.The initial conversion price has been set at €1.2271 (US$1.3204)  representing a premium of 37.5% above the volume weighted average price (VWAP) of a Share on Euronext Amsterdam between opening of trading on the launch date and the pricing of the offering (i.e. €0.8924 (US$0.9602)). The initial conversion price of the New Bonds will be subject to customary adjustment provisions as set out in the terms and conditions. The number of ordinary shares initially underlying the New Bonds is 81 492 951  representing 12% of the Company’s current issued share capital. The New Bonds are listed on the Frankfurt Exchange (ISIN: XS2763018889).The New Bonds are classified as hybrid financial instruments under IAS 32 and pursuant to it the debt host contract and the embedded derivative for the fair value of the conversion rights into Pharming shares (the “conversion option”) are recognized separately. Initial recognition values for the individual components were determined as follows:the conversion option at recognition was measured using a pricing model. As the Company did not have sufficient placement capacity to fulfil conversion of the New Bonds into ordinary shares at the date of issue  the conversion option was recognized as a financial liability derivative. During the shareholder’s meeting on May 21  2024  the Company received shareholder approval to increase share capital to support the potential conversion. At the Physical settlement notice date of June 11  2024  when the New Bond holders were notified that the cash settlement alternative would no longer be available  the conversion option was reclassified to equity at fair value  which resulted in a fair value gain of US$5.1 million immediately prior to the reclassification. Subsequently  the value of this equity component is not remeasured and amounts to US$11.1 million at June 30  2024.the debt host contract component was measured as the difference between the proceeds from the bond and the value of the conversion option at initial recognition. This debt host contract is subsequently measured at amortized cost  which amounts to US$90.5 million at June 30  2024.Direct costs associated with the issue of the New Bonds were allocated to the debt host contract (US$2.4 million) and the conversion option (US$0.4 million) in amounts proportional to the above mentioned initial value. They were accounted for respectively in the amortized cost (debt host contract) and in the income statement (conversion option).The movements of the convertible bonds were as follows:Amounts in US$ ‘000 Period toJune 30 2024 Period toDecember 31 2023 Balance at January 1 138 422 133 386 Carrying value initial recognition 88 823 — Interest paid (cash flow) (2 024) (4 046) Amortization 1 796 830 Accrued interest 1 957 4 046 Carrying value repurchase (134 922) — Currency translation (3 582) 4 206 Carrying value at end of period 90 470 138 42219. Earnings per share and diluted sharesBasic earnings per share is calculated based on the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share in the case of a profit is computed based on the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding including the dilutive effect of shares to be issued in the future under certain arrangements such as option plans. However  as the net result represents a loss  the diluted earnings per share are equal to the basic earnings per share. For 1H 2024 and 1H 2023  the basic and diluted earnings per share are:1H 2024 1H 2023 Net profit (loss) attributable to equity owners of the parent (in US $ '000) (13 666) (10 889) Weighted average shares outstanding (in '000) 672 068 657 270 Basic profit (loss) per share (in US$) (0.020) (0.017) Weighted average fully-diluted shares outstanding (in '000) 785 511 724 060 Fully-diluted profit per share (in US$) (0.020) (0.017)Diluted sharesThe composition of the number of shares and share rights outstanding as well as authorized share capital as per June 30  2024 is provided in the table below:Amounts in '000 December 31  2023 Shares issued Other June 30  2024 Issued shares 671 073 7 281 — 678 354 RSU 11 187 (65) (145) 10 977 Options 34 482 (5 806) (3 851) 24 825 Convertible bonds 62 413 19 080 81 493 LTIP 17 534 (1 235) 3 353 19 652 Fully-diluted shares 796 690 174 18 437 815 300 Available for issue 259 310 (174) (18 437) 240 700 Authorized share capital 1 056 000 — — 1 056 00020.

Please refer to this link: https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/ck932u2nSaint-Herblain (France) and Schlieren (Zurich)  August 1  2024 – Valneva SE (Nasdaq: VALN; Euronext Paris: VLA)  a specialty vaccine company and LimmaTech Biologics AG  a clinical-stage biotech company developing vaccines for the prevention of life-threatening diseases  today announced that the companies have entered into a strategic partnership and exclusive licensing agreement for the development  manufacturing and commercialization of Shigella4V (S4V)  a tetravalent bioconjugate vaccine candidate against shigellosis.Shigellosis  caused by Shigella bacteria  is the second leading cause of fatal diarrheal disease worldwide. It is estimated that up to 165 million cases of disease and an estimated 600 000 deaths are attributed to Shigella each year1  particularly among children in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs). No approved Shigella vaccine is currently available and the development of Shigella vaccines has been identified as a priority by the World Health Organization (WHO)2. Shigellosis also affects international travelers from high-income countries and deployed military personnel in endemic regions. The global market for a vaccine against Shigella is estimated to exceed $500 million annually3.Under the terms of the agreement with Valneva  LimmaTech will receive an upfront payment of €10 million and be eligible to receive additional regulatory  development and sales-based milestone payments as well as low double-digit royalties on sales. LimmaTech will be responsible for conducting a Phase 2 Controlled Human Infection Model (CHIM) and a Phase 2 pediatric study in LMICs. Both clinical trials are expected to begin in the second half of 2024. Valneva will assume all further development  including CMC (chemistry  manufacturing and controls) and regulatory activities  and be responsible for its commercialization worldwide if approved.Thomas Lingelbach  Chief Executive Officer of Valneva  commented  “We are very pleased to partner with LimmaTech to advance a promising program in an area of high unmet medical need. The Shigella vaccine candidate enables a potential first-in-class vaccine solution for both LMICs and travelers and  as such  represents a potentially highly synergistic product for Valneva. The anticipated development path follows a staggered and risk-mitigated strategy  and hence allows an efficient capital allocation in line with our communicated plan of having a new R&D program in Phase 3 by 2027.”Dr. Franz-Werner Haas  Chief Executive Officer of LimmaTech  said  “Having developed the S4V Shigella vaccine candidate from its early discovery phase to the promising clinical data we achieved to date  we are excited to accelerate the program with our partnership with Valneva. Their proven expertise in late-stage development and commercialization of vaccines will expedite potential market approval and bring a Shigella vaccine to people in need. This agreement underscores our capabilities to leverage LimmaTech’s proficiency in vaccine development with the best path to develop programs rapidly. We continue to expand our pipeline of vaccine candidates to combat microbial-based infectious diseases  providing protection against antimicrobial resistance  a dramatically increasing global health threat.”LimmaTech initiated the tetravalent Shigella vaccine candidate and continued to lead its development as part of its ongoing collaboration with GSK  and later in-licensed the vaccine candidate from GSK. In February 2024  LimmaTech reported positive interim Phase 1/2 data for the S4V vaccine candidate  including a favorable safety and tolerability profile as well as robust data on immunogenicity against the four most common pathogenic Shigella serotypes  S. flexneri 2a  3a  6  and S. sonnei4. The results of the completed Phase 1/2 study confirmed the interim data.About ShigellosisShigellosis is a global health threat caused by the Gram-negative Shigella bacteria. It is estimated that up to 165 million infections5 are due to Shigella of which 62.3 million occur in children younger than five years. Diarrheal infection is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality in numerous countries as well as in travelers and deployed military personnel in endemic regions. There are an estimated 600 000 deaths attributed to Shigella each year and it is the second leading cause for diarrheal deaths6. The standard treatment for shigellosis is oral rehydration and antibiotic therapy  however  the bacteria have acquired resistance to many antibiotics with numerous reports of outbreaks of multidrug-resistant strains  making treatment extremely difficult. Currently  no licensed Shigella vaccine is available.About Valneva SEWe are a specialty vaccine company that develops  manufactures  and commercializes prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases addressing unmet medical needs. We take a highly specialized and targeted approach  applying our deep expertise across multiple vaccine modalities  focused on providing either first-  best- or only-in-class vaccine solutions.We have a strong track record  having advanced multiple vaccines from early R&D to approvals  and currently market three proprietary travel vaccines  including the world’s first and only chikungunya vaccine  as well as certain third-party vaccines.Revenues from our growing commercial business help fuel the continued advancement of our vaccine pipeline. This includes the only Lyme disease vaccine candidate in advanced clinical development  which is partnered with Pfizer  as well as vaccine candidates against the Zika virus and other global public health threats.

The importance of adding alemtuzumab to the lymphodepletion regimen has been demonstrated in Cellectis’ BALLI-01 study  where the addition of this lymphodepletion agent to the fludarabine and cyclophosphamide regimen was associated with sustained lymphodepletion and significantly higher UCART22 cell expansion allowing for greater clinical activity ” said Mark Frattini  M.D.  Ph.D. Chief Medical Officer at Cellectis.Cellectis is the inventor of the combination of CD52 knockout UCART cells with a lymphodepleting regimen containing an anti-CD52 antibody such as alemtuzumab. The CD52 knockout aims to render the UCART product candidates resistant to alemtuzumab as part of the lymphodepleting regimen. Cellectis’ UCART22 product candidate has the CD52 gene inactivated by TALEN® gene editing technology.The FDA grants ODD status to medicines intended for the treatment  diagnosis or prevention of rare diseases or disorders that affect fewer than 200 000 people in the US. Receiving ODD may help to expedite and reduce the cost of development  approval  and commercialization of a therapeutic agent.About CellectisCellectis is a clinical-stage biotechnology company using its pioneering gene-editing platform to develop life-saving cell and gene therapies.

This causes major medical issues including increased mortality  repeated hospitalizations  severe pain  difficulty breathing and restricted mobility. Although diuretics are standard of care  they become ineffective  intolerable or exacerbate the problem in many patients. There are limited effective treatment options  resulting in poor clinical outcomes  high costs and a major impact on their quality of life. Sequana Medical is seeking to provide innovative treatment options for this large and growing ""diureticresistant"" patient population. alfapump® and DSR® are Sequana Medical's proprietary platforms that work with the body to treat diuretic-resistant fluid overload  delivering major clinical and quality of life benefits for patients and reducing costs for healthcare systems.The Company's Premarket Approval (PMA) application for the alfapump was submitted to the US FDA in December 2023 and accepted for substantive review in January 2024  having reported positive primary and secondary endpoint data from the North American pivotal POSEIDON study in recurrent or refractory ascites due to liver cirrhosis. US market approval of the alfapump is anticipated before the end of Q1 2025 with US commercial launch planned for H2 2025.Results of the Company's RED DESERT and SAHARA proof-of-concept studies in heart failure support DSR's mechanism of action as breaking the vicious cycle of cardiorenal syndrome. All three patients from the non-randomized cohort of MOJAVE  a US randomized controlled multi-center Phase 1/2a clinical study  have been successfully treated with DSR  resulting in a dramatic improvement in diuretic response and virtual elimination of loop diuretic requirements. The independent Data Safety Monitoring Board approved the start of the randomized MOJAVE cohort of up to a further 30 patients  which is planned after alfapump US PMA approval.Sequana Medical is listed on the regulated market of Euronext Brussels (Ticker: SEQUA.BR) and headquartered in Ghent  Belgium. For further information  please visit www.sequanamedical.com.Important Regulatory DisclaimersThe alfapump® system is currently not approved in the United States or Canada. In the United States and Canada  the alfapump system is currently under clinical investigation (POSEIDON Trial) and is being studied in adult patients with refractory or recurrent ascites due to liver cirrhosis. DSR® therapy is still in development and it should be noted that any statements regarding safety and efficacy arise from ongoing pre-clinical and clinical investigations which have yet to be completed. There is no link between DSR therapy and ongoing investigations with the alfapump system in Europe  the United States or Canada.Note: alfapump® and DSR® are registered trademarks.Forward-looking statementsThis press release may contain predictions  estimates or other information that might be considered forward-looking statements.

(Luxembourg) and Rodevita S.A. (Luxembourg)  which own property and operating assets in Italy  mainly relating to the operation of nursing homes.This agreement puts an end in a constructive way to all relations between emeis and Mr Tribuno and to any disputes that may have existed between the parties.The transaction involves the acquisition of the entire share capital and voting rights of 17 companies1 based in Italy  Luxembourg and Germany. Lipany S.A. (Luxembourg)  Rodevita S.A. (Luxembourg) and Rodevita SpA (Italy) are not included in the scope of consolidation taken over by emeis.Upon completion of this transaction  emeis will own a high-quality portfolio of 15 buildings  almost all of them nursing homes (11 in Italy  4 in Germany  3 of which are currently under construction).

The conference will be held in Barcelona  Spain from September 13-17  2024.Poster Presentation Details:Title: Updated survival and vaccine response from the NIPU trial; A randomised  phase II study evaluating nivolumab and ipilimumab with or without UV1 vaccination in patients with pleural mesotheliomaPresentation Number: 1917PSpeaker: Vilde D. Haakensen  MD  PhD  Project Group Leader at the Oslo University HospitalDate: Saturday  September 14  2024The first comprehensive data from the NIPU Phase II trial was presented at the ESMO Congress 2023 . While the study did not meet its primary endpoint  UV1 in combination with the checkpoint inhibitors ipilimumab and nivolumab demonstrated clinically meaningful overall survival benefit with no added toxicities  compared to ipilimumab and nivolumab alone  in the second-line treatment of patients with malignant mesothelioma. The results were also published in the European Journal of Cancer in March 2024.==ENDS==About NIPUNIPU ( N ivolumab and I pilimumab P lus/minus U V1 vaccination) is a randomized  multi-center phase II trial in which Ultimovacs’ universal cancer vaccine  UV1  is evaluated in combination with Bristol-Myers Squibb’s checkpoint inhibitors  nivolumab and ipilimumab  as second-line treatment of malignant mesothelioma. The trial sponsor is Oslo University Hospital  supported in the preparation and execution of the trial by Ultimovacs and Bristol-Myers Squibb.The 118 patients were randomized 1:1 into two treatment arms. All participants receive treatment with nivolumab (240 mg every 2 weeks) and ipilimumab (1 mg/kg every 6 weeks) until disease progression  unacceptable toxicity or for a maximum of 2 years. Patients randomized to the experimental arm received 8 intradermal injections of UV1 vaccine during the first three months of treatment. The objective of the study is to achieve a clinically meaningful benefit in patients with malignant mesothelioma (MPM) after progression on first-line standard platinum doublet chemotherapy. Subsequent events emerging in patients in both arms of the NIPU study will continue to be monitored beyond read-out of the primary endpoint. The ipilimumab and nivolumab combination has recently been approved as first-line treatment for patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma in Europe and the U.S.The trial was sized to detect a target PFS HR of 0.6  with 80% power and a 1-sided alpha of 0.1. Overall survival was calculated using the same method as for PFS.About UV1UV1 is a universal cancer vaccine designed to induce a specific T-cell response against telomerase. UV1 consists of long  synthetic peptides representing a sequence in the reverse transcriptase subunit of telomerase (hTERT)  shown to induce CD4+ T-cells. These CD4+ T-cells have the potential to provide inflammatory signals  and T-cell support is believed to be critical for triggering a strong anti-tumor immune response. Following intradermal injection  antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in the skin are exposed to the vaccine peptides. These APCs will process the peptides and present vaccine epitopes on Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) molecules to naïve T-cells in the lymph nodes. Activated vaccine-specific T-cells will then enter the circulation and search for cells displaying their cognate antigen in the context of HLA molecules.The UV1 peptides contain several epitopes  shown to be non-restrictive in terms of (HLA) alleles for presentation. It is  therefore not required to perform HLA pre-screening of patients  which potentially enables broad population utilization of the vaccine. UV1 is administered over three months as eight intradermal injections together with the immune-modulator GM-CSF.About UltimovacsUltimovacs is a clinical-stage biotechnology leader in novel immunotherapeutic cancer vaccines.

After taking account of exchange rate variations  it shows a decline of -1.4% on reported figures.Over 2023-2024 fiscal year Quarter 4  revenue showed an increase of +2.6% on a like-for-like basis* and +0.5% on reported figures.Over this last quarter  volumes remained negatively oriented  and reflect a still weak consumer dynamic  particularly in June due to unfavorable weather conditions despite now limited inflation.Despite more moderate sales growth over the last 2 quarters  which does not make it possible to deliver our annual revenue growth target  the group confirms its objective of increasing recurring operating income  thanks to the good performance of branded activities and the effectiveness of internal productivity and cost-control initiatives.Activity by Geographical RegionTotal Consolidated Revenue(in € millions) 12 months2023-2024 12 months2022-2023 VariationReported figures VariationLike-for-like basis* 4rd quarter2023-2024 4rd quarter2022-2023 VariationReported figures VariationLike-for-like basis* Europe Zone 1 558.2 1 508.1 3.3% 2.9% 200.8 392.2 0.2% 0.1% Non-Europe Zone 813.6 898.1 -9.4% 2.4% 393.0 198.5 1.1% 7.3% Total 2 371.8 2 406.2 -1.4% 2.7% 593.8 590.7 0.5% 2.6%Activity by Operating SegmentsTotal Consolidated Revenue(in € millions) 12 months2023-2024 12 months2022-2023 VariationReported figures VariationLike-for-like basis* 4rd quarter2023-2024 4rd quarter2022-2023 VariationReported figures VariationLike-for-like basis* Canned 1 120.1 1 126.3 -0.5% 6.1% 265.2 265.8 -0.2% 4.1% Frozen 303.0 278.8 8.7% 10.3% 75.7 66.8 13.3% 14.8% Fresh processed 948.6 1 001.1 -5.2% -3.3% 252.8 258.1 -2.0% -2.2% Total 2 371.8 2 406.2 -1.4% 2.7% 593.8 590.7 0.5% 2.6%Europe ZoneThe Europe Zone  representing 65.7% of the business activity over the fiscal year  posted a growth over this period of +3.3% on reported figures and +2.9% on a like-for-like basis*  and of +0.2% and +0.1% respectively in Quarter 4.The Europe Zone showed a marked slowdown in its business activity over the last quarter with declining volumes sold.The canned and frozen private label ranges have seen a significant withdrawal linked in particular to occasional changes in supply policies. The branded business showed a significant growth over the period in both volumes and value  in both retail and food service channels.In the fresh processed (bagged salads) and the fresh prepared segments  business activity suffered in Quarter 4  and particularly in June  from poor weather and an unfavorable base effect compared with the same period last year. The activity presented a stable turnover over the year  with salads in Italy and fresh prepared segments reporting growth.Non-Europe ZoneThe Non-Europe Zone  representing 34.3% of the business activity over the fiscal year  grew over the 2023-2024 fiscal year by +2.4% on a like-for-like basis* (-9.4% on reported figures). For Quarter 4  the increases are respectively +7.3% on a like-for-like basis* and +1.1% on reported figures.In this last quarter of the fiscal year  the Eurasia region continues to grow both in volumes and in value thanks to the solid growth of the Bonduelle canned brand and further sustained acceleration in frozen food in retail.North American activity remained  over the quarter  down in volumes and stable in value  the bowls and salad kits segments  which carry added value  both progressed in volumes and in value in retail  the bagged salads segment showing itself in decline. Business activity again remains overall in decline both in volumes and in value on the whole fiscal year.OutlookThe end of the financial year was marked by increased pressure on volumes leading to a revenue slightly lower than expected but including a favorable products and brands mix.This commercial mix  added to competitiveness initiatives and strict control of our overheads  should make possible  despite a late and delicate start of harvests due to the weather context  to reach a current operating profitability for the 2023-2024 fiscal year at the top of the target announced in October 2023  i.e. 75 to 80 million euros at constant exchange rates  and a current operating margin above 3%.* at constant currency exchange rate and scope of consolidation basis.

The aggregate maximum consideration for the purchase of ordinary shares under the London contract is $1.75 billion and the maximum consideration for the purchase of ordinary shares under the Netherlands contract is $1.75 billion. Purchases under the London contract will be carried out in accordance with the Company’s authority1 to repurchase shares on-market and will be effected within certain contractually agreed parameters.

Likewise  the words “we”  “us” and “our” are also used to refer to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general or to those who work for them. These terms are also used where no useful purpose is served by identifying the particular entity or entities. ‘‘Subsidiaries’’  “Shell subsidiaries” and “Shell companies” as used in this announcement refer to entities over which Shell plc either directly or indirectly has control. The term “joint venture”  “joint operations”  “joint arrangements”  and “associates” may also be used to refer to a commercial arrangement in which Shell has a direct or indirect ownership interest with one or more parties. The term “Shell interest” is used for convenience to indicate the direct and/or indirect ownership interest held by Shell in an entity or unincorporated joint arrangement  after exclusion of all third-party interest.Forward-Looking StatementsThis announcement contains forward-looking statements (within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) concerning the financial condition  results of operations and businesses of Shell. All statements other than statements of historical fact are  or may be deemed to be  forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management’s current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results  performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking statements include  among other things  statements concerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements expressing management’s expectations  beliefs  estimates  forecasts  projections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as “aim”; “ambition”; ‘‘anticipate’’; ‘‘believe’’; “commit”; “commitment”; ‘‘could’’; ‘‘estimate’’; ‘‘expect’’; ‘‘goals’’; ‘‘intend’’; ‘‘may’’; “milestones”; ‘‘objectives’’; ‘‘outlook’’; ‘‘plan’’; ‘‘probably’’; ‘‘project’’; ‘‘risks’’; “schedule”; ‘‘seek’’; ‘‘should’’; ‘‘target’’; ‘‘will’’; “would” and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this announcement  including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell’s products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets  and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative  judicial  fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks  including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities  delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics  such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak  regional conflicts  such as the Russia-Ukraine war  and a significant cybersecurity breach; and (n) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this announcement are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc’s Form 20-F for the year ended December 31  2023 (available at www.shell.com/investors/news-and-filings/sec-filings.html and www.sec.gov). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this announcement and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this announcement  August 1  2024. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information  future events or other information. In light of these risks  results could differ materially from those stated  implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this announcement.Shell’s Net Carbon IntensityAlso  in this announcement we may refer to Shell’s “Net Carbon Intensity” (NCI)  which includes Shell’s carbon emissions from the production of our energy products  our suppliers’ carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers’ carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell’s NCI also includes the emissions associated with the production and use of energy products produced by others which Shell purchases for resale. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the terms Shell’s “Net Carbon Intensity” or NCI are for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries.Shell’s net-zero emissions targetShell’s operating plan  outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly  they reflect our Scope 1  Scope 2 and NCI targets over the next ten years. However  Shell’s operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net-zero emissions target  as this target is currently outside our planning period. In the future  as society moves towards net-zero emissions  we expect Shell’s operating plans to reflect this movement. However  if society is not net zero in 2050  as of today  there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target.Forward-Looking non-GAAP measuresThis announcement may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as cash capital expenditure and divestments. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell  such as oil and gas prices  interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover  estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc’s consolidated financial statements.The contents of websites referred to in this announcement do not form part of this announcement.We may have used certain terms  such as resources  in this announcement that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC.

Please refer to this link: https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/ck932u2nSaint-Herblain (France) and Schlieren (Zurich)  August 1  2024 “ Valneva SE (Nasdaq: VALN; Euronext Paris: VLA)  a specialty vaccine company and LimmaTech Biologics AG  a clinical-stage biotech company developing vaccines for the prevention of life-threatening diseases  today announced that the companies have entered into a strategic partnership and exclusive licensing agreement for the development  manufacturing and commercialization of Shigella4V (S4V)  a tetravalent bioconjugate vaccine candidate against shigellosis.Shigellosis  caused by Shigella bacteria  is the second leading cause of fatal diarrheal disease worldwide. It is estimated that up to 165 million cases of disease and an estimated 600 000 deaths are attributed to Shigella each year1  particularly among children in Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs). No approved Shigella vaccine is currently available and the development of Shigella vaccines has been identified as a priority by the World Health Organization (WHO)2. Shigellosis also affects international travelers from high-income countries and deployed military personnel in endemic regions. The global market for a vaccine against Shigella is estimated to exceed $500 million annually3.Under the terms of the agreement with Valneva  LimmaTech will receive an upfront payment of €10 million and be eligible to receive additional regulatory  development and sales-based milestone payments as well as low double-digit royalties on sales. LimmaTech will be responsible for conducting a Phase 2 Controlled Human Infection Model (CHIM) and a Phase 2 pediatric study in LMICs. Both clinical trials are expected to begin in the second half of 2024. Valneva will assume all further development  including CMC (chemistry  manufacturing and controls) and regulatory activities  and be responsible for its commercialization worldwide if approved.Thomas Lingelbach  Chief Executive Officer of Valneva  commented  We are very pleased to partner with LimmaTech to advance a promising program in an area of high unmet medical need. The Shigella vaccine candidate enables a potential first-in-class vaccine solution for both LMICs and travelers and  as such  represents a potentially highly synergistic product for Valneva. The anticipated development path follows a staggered and risk-mitigated strategy  and hence allows an efficient capital allocation in line with our communicated plan of having a new R&D program in Phase 3 by 2027.Dr. Franz-Werner Haas  Chief Executive Officer of LimmaTech  said  Having developed the S4V Shigella vaccine candidate from its early discovery phase to the promising clinical data we achieved to date  we are excited to accelerate the program with our partnership with Valneva. Their proven expertise in late-stage development and commercialization of vaccines will expedite potential market approval and bring a Shigella vaccine to people in need. This agreement underscores our capabilities to leverage LimmaTech's proficiency in vaccine development with the best path to develop programs rapidly. We continue to expand our pipeline of vaccine candidates to combat microbial-based infectious diseases  providing protection against antimicrobial resistance  a dramatically increasing global health threat.LimmaTech initiated the tetravalent Shigella vaccine candidate and continued to lead its development as part of its ongoing collaboration with GSK  and later in-licensed the vaccine candidate from GSK. In February 2024  LimmaTech reported positive interim Phase 1/2 data for the S4V vaccine candidate  including a favorable safety and tolerability profile as well as robust data on immunogenicity against the four most common pathogenic Shigella serotypes  S. flexneri 2a  3a  6  and S. sonnei4. The results of the completed Phase 1/2 study confirmed the interim data.About ShigellosisShigellosis is a global health threat caused by the Gram-negative Shigella bacteria. It is estimated that up to 165 million infections5 are due to Shigella of which 62.3 million occur in children younger than five years. Diarrheal infection is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality in numerous countries as well as in travelers and deployed military personnel in endemic regions. There are an estimated 600 000 deaths attributed to Shigella each year and it is the second leading cause for diarrheal deaths6. The standard treatment for shigellosis is oral rehydration and antibiotic therapy  however  the bacteria have acquired resistance to many antibiotics with numerous reports of outbreaks of multidrug-resistant strains  making treatment extremely difficult. Currently  no licensed Shigella vaccine is available.About Valneva SEWe are a specialty vaccine company that develops  manufactures  and commercializes prophylactic vaccines for infectious diseases addressing unmet medical needs.

Revenue growth contribution from acquisitions was 4.2%  while FX translation represented a 2.1% headwind during the period.During the first half of the year  we completed the acquisition of Oktrade and DBH  strengthening our lateral value chain for the Personal Care market in Turkey  and the Advanced Materials & Additives market in the DACH region respectively.Gross profit declined by 4.7% year-on-year (-2.5% in constant currency) to EUR 240.6m in H1 2024  translating to a 51bp contraction in gross profit margin to 26.2%  driven by the mix shift towards Industrial Chemicals during the period  as well as time lag in pricing. Adjusted EBITA decreased by 8.6% to EUR 128.1m  resulting in conversion margin of 53.2%.AmericasQ2 2024 Q2 2023 Reported Change (in millions of €) H1 2024 H1 2023 Reported Change Constant Currency 415.3 376.5 10.3% Revenue 786.7 734.9 7.1% 5.8% 101.4 85.3 18.8% Gross Profit 193.7 176.2 9.9% 9.1% 24.4% 22.7% 175 bp Gross Profit Margin 24.6% 24.0% 63 bp 76 bp 57.1 53.9 5.8% Adjusted EBITDA 106.2 105.3 0.9% 0.3% 13.7% 14.3% -58 bp Adjusted EBITDA Margin 13.5% 14.3% -83 bp -73 bp 53.3 51.2 4.1% Adjusted EBITA 98.5 100.0 -1.5% -2.0% 12.8% 13.6% -77 bp Adjusted EBITA Margin 12.5% 13.6% -109 bp -98 bp 52.6% 60.0% -745 bp Conversion Margin 50.9% 56.7% -588 bp -572 bpRevenue in the Americas was EUR 786.7m in H1 2024  representing a year-on-year growth of 7.1% (5.8% in constant currency). The Group's activities in the Americas reported a 4.0% organic revenue decline  as volume recovery in US CASE and improvement in the broader market in Latin America supported a stabilization in organic revenue in Q2. Revenue growth contribution from acquisitions was 9.8%  whilst FX translation represented a 1.2% tailwind during the period.In H1 2024  Azelis completed the acquisition of Localpack  reinforcing our footprint in Colombia.Gross profit in the region increased by 9.9% to EUR 193.7m  with gross profit margin expanding 63 bps to 24.6%. The uptick was driven largely by improved margin performance across our businesses in Latin America  offsetting the continued softer margins in the US Industrial Chemicals due to continued price pressure in CASE. During the period  Adjusted EBITA declined by 1.5% to EUR 98.5m  mainly due to lower benefit of cost control measures compared to H1 2023  resulting in Adjusted EBITA margin of 12.5%. The 109 bp Adjusted EBITA margin contraction also reflects the impact of dilution from Latin America as we work to integrate our recent acquisitions. The lower Adjusted EBITA resulted in conversion margin of 50.9% in H1 2024.Asia PacificQ2 2024 Q2 2023 Reported Change (in millions of €) H1 2024 H1 2023 Reported Change Constant Currency 222.2 228.4 -2.7% Revenue 441.8 461.9 -4.4% -0.9% 45.1 43.2 4.3% Gross Profit 92.2 88.3 4.4% 7.7% 20.3% 18.9% 137 bp Gross Profit Margin 20.9% 19.1% 176 bp 171 bp 24.9 21.7 14.3% Adjusted EBITDA 49.0 45.0 9.0% 12.3% 11.2% 9.5% 167 bp Adjusted EBITDA Margin 11.1% 9.7% 136 bp 134 bp 22.6 19.8 14.4% Adjusted EBITA 44.8 41.2 8.6% 11.9% 10.2% 8.7% 152 bp Adjusted EBITA Margin 10.1% 8.9% 121 bp 119 bp 50.2% 45.8% 441 bp Conversion Margin 48.6% 46.7% 186 bp 186 bpRevenue in APAC declined by 4.4% to EUR 441.8m in H1 2024  driven by organic revenue contraction of 3.6% and a negative impact from FX translation of 3.5%  partly mitigated by a 2.8% revenue growth contribution from recent acquisitions. The organic revenue contraction in the region follows a strong performance in the comparable period last year  when the region delivered 36.0% revenue growth  of which 6.9% was organic.During the first half of the year  we completed the acquisition of Agspec  a leading distributor of crop nutrition  crop protection and specialty agricultural products in Australia.Gross profit in the region grew 4.4% to EUR 92.2m  representing gross profit margin of 20.9%. The 176 bp expansion in gross profit margin was driven by improving profitability of recent acquisitions. Adjusted EBITA increased by 8.6% to EUR 44.8m  reflecting continuous margin improvement initiatives. The improvement in both gross profit and Adjusted EBITA margin resulted in a 186 bp expansion in conversion margin to 48.6% during the period.Holding companiesQ2 2024 Q2 2023 Reported Change H1 2024 H1 2023 Reported Change Constant Currency -8.5 -9.2 -7.2% Adjusted EBITA (in millions of €) -17.4 -18.0 -3.4% -3.4% -0.8% -0.9% 10 bp As % of Group Revenues -0.8% -0.8% 3 bp 4 bpOperating costs at the Group's holding companies  relating to the Group's non-operating entities as well as the head office in Belgium  were EUR 17.4m in H1 2024  compared to EUR 18.0m in the previous year.

During the period  Group organic revenue declined by 4.4%  as ongoing pricing pressure offset the impact of volume recovery in many end markets across our regions. Revenue from acquisitions represented topline growth contribution of 5.8%  while FX translation represented a 1.2% headwind.Revenue in Life Sciences was EUR 1.3bn  up 2.4% compared to the prior year  as revenue growth contribution from acquisitions offset the organic decline during the period. Revenue in Industrial Chemicals declined by 3.3% to EUR 797.3m  with the ongoing pricing pressure offsetting the impact of volume recovery in our end markets.ProfitabilityIn H1 2024  gross profit increased by 1.8% to EUR 526.5m. Gross profit margin expanded by 39 bps to 24.5%  supported by positive mix effect from improved performance from recent acquisitions. Adjusted EBITA was EUR 254.0m  representing a 3.6% year-on-year decline  due largely to lower benefit from cost control measures compared to the prior year. Adjusted EBITA margin was 11.8% in H1 2024.Net financial expense in H1 2024 was broadly stable at EUR 72.4m despite the higher interest expense due to the full year impact of higher gross debt with higher interest rates  as this was partly mitigated by higher interest income on our cash balance. Our result for the period also includes a non-cash charge of EUR 12.2m from the impact of hyperinflation accounting in Turkey. Tax expense for the period was EUR 42.2m  implying an effective tax rate (ETR) of 29.6%  versus 29.0% in the prior year.Net profit was EUR 100.1m  and cash earnings per share was EUR 0.56 for H1 2024.(in millions of €) H1 2024 H1 2023 Operating profit 214.7 225.0 Net Financial Expense -72.4 -71.2 Financial Income 15.3 3.4 Financial Expense -87.7 -74.6 Interest Expense on Bank Loans and Overdrafts -49.4 -40.2 Interest Lease Commitments -4.2 -2.0 Other Financial Cost -34.1 -32.4 Profit Before Tax 142.3 153.8 Tax Expense -42.2 -44.6 Net Profit 100.1 109.2 Earnings per share 0.39 0.44 Cash earnings per share 0.56 0.60Cash Flow and FinancingNet working capital to revenue normalized for acquisitions was 15.4% at the end of June 2024  versus 13.4% at the end of December 2023  and 15.4% in June 2023.

This was achieved in a volatile consumer spending environment that exhibited a visible softening across many European countries in the second quarter. During the semester  we also achieved good commercial developments of registering new signatures and with the onboarding of c.30 000 new merchants on Worldline’s target platform.We also focused on our Group’s accelerated transformation and achieved important milestones on our Power24 roadmap. The social processes are now completed and the new operating model is live. These developments allow us to raise today by c.10 % our expected run-rate cash cost savings to €220m in 2025.In parallel  we have pursued the development of our strategic growth initiatives notably with the operational set-up of CAWL  our joint-venture with Crédit Agricole in France  which has a confirmed go live date in the first half of 2025  and with new product launches and partnerships expanding Worldline’s value proposition.As witnessed by many companies in consumer-driven industries  the European domestic consumption trends have slowed down during the second quarter and the speed of a potential recovery remains uncertain at this stage. As a result  we adapt our financial expectations for the rest of the year considering this uncertain macro environment with a strong focus on free cash flow generation that we intend to keep in line with our initial ambition.We are on-track in our transition to a transformed and streamlined Group. Worldline will quickly start to benefit from a strengthened competitiveness and operational leverage that will drive solid medium-term performance. We will host a capital market day on November 26th  2024  to present our new medium-term ambition and strategic growth levers.”H1 2024 key figuresIn € million H1 2024 H1 2023 change Published Revenue* 2 289 2 242 +2.1% Net Net Revenue** 1 862 1 836 +1.4% Adjusted EBITDA*** 514 518 -0.9% % of Published revenue 22.5% 23.1% (67) bps % of Net Net Revenue 27.6% 28.2% (63) bps EBITDA 282 425 -33.8% % of Published revenue 12.3% 19.0% (670) bps % of Net Net Revenue 15.1% 23.2% (810) bps Net income Group share (29) 81 % of statutory revenue -1.3% 3.6% Normalized net income Group share 210 243 -13.5% % of statutory revenue 9.2% 10.8% Free cash flow (FCF) 82 232 -64.5% Adjusted EBITDA to FCF conversion rate**** 16.0% 45.9% Closing net debt 1 696 1 837 *at constant scope and exchange rates ** Revenue excluding schemes and partner fees ***Previously OMDA  renamed (no change in calculation) and H1 2023 at constant scope and exchange rates **** H1 2023 conversion rate calculated on H1 2023 statutory OMDAWorldline’s H1 2024 revenue reached € 2 289 million  representing +2.1% revenue organic growth (+4.2% excluding Merchants’ termination). Despite resilient activity in Italy and in verticals such as travel and gaming  Merchant Services performance (€ 1 658 million revenue  +3.2% organic growth) was impacted by softer macroeconomic conditions during the second quarter in our core geographies  less consumer spending in Europe and the termination of some of our online merchants as planned. Financial Services performance (€ 457 million revenue  1.5% organic decline) reflected the impact of the earlier re-insourcing of certain contracts  which was partially offset by the good performance of acquiring and issuing processing. Lastly  Mobility & e-Transactional Services (€ 174 million revenue  +1.0% organic growth) achieved a sustained performance driven by good momentum in its Trusted Services division.The Group’s Adjusted EBITDA reached € 514 million in H1 2024 (22.5% of revenue)  broadly stable compared to H1 2023. The profitability in Merchant Services decreased as anticipated (driven by planned merchant terminations). It could not be fully offset by improved adjusted EBITDA margin in the Financials Services and Mobility & e-Transactional Services divisions and lower costs in corporate functions.Net income Group share was € (29) million  mainly impacted by €174m of Power24 non-cash provision. On a Normalized basis (excluding other operating income net of tax) Net income Group share reached € 211 million.Normalized basic and diluted EPS were both € 0.74 in H1 2024  versus € 0.86 in H1 2023.Free cash flow was € 82 million  i.e. 16.0% cash conversion of adjusted EBITDA (free cash flow divided by adjusted EBITDA). It mainly reflects:Integration and restructuring costs excluding Power24 down €40m to €55m;Capex representing €160m in line with the expected full year trajectory;Working capital normalization with a €42m outflow;€42m cash costs related to Power24.Excluding Power24 cash costs  free cash flow stands at € 124 million  representing a 24.1% cash conversion of adjusted EBITDA.At the end of H1 2024  Group Net debt amounted to € 1 696 million. representing a Group leverage ratio of 1.5x on an LTM basis.Q2 revenue figures by Global Business Lines:Revenue In € million Q22024 Q22023* Organic growth (Published) Organic growth (NNR) Merchant Services 871 849 +2.6% +2.4% Financial Services 232 229 -1.5% -2.0% Mobility & e-Transactional Services 89 84 +1.3% +1.3% Worldline 1 192 1 162 +1.7% +1.2% *at constant scope and exchange rates* at constant scope and exchange ratesWorldline’s Q2 2024 revenue reached € 1 192 million  representing +1.7% organic growth. In the Merchants Services division  despite good resilience in the current soft macro context  the quarter was penalized by the termination of some of our specific merchant contracts as previously communicated. The Financial Services division was impacted by an earlier-than-budgetedre-insourcing of certain contracts. Mobility & e-Transactional Services benefited from a good dynamic in Trusted Services.Merchant ServicesMerchant Services’ revenue in Q2 2024 reached € 871 million  representing a robust organic growth of +2.6% (c.6% excluding announced specific merchant termination). The quarter was impacted by the soft macroeconomic context at the end of the quarter and by the full expected effect of contracts termination. By division  the growth was mainly led by:Commercial Acquiring: Stable performance despite solid growth in Italy offset by some online contracts’ termination.Payment Acceptance: Soft performance  with good momentum in the Travel and Gaming verticals  does not fully compensate for the effect of lower consumer spending on the Retail vertical. Digital Services: Solid growth driven by POS roll-out related to specific contracts  in Germany.During the second quarter  Merchant Services commercial activity was healthy  particularly in the EV charging vertical  in which Worldline already has a strong franchise with an estimated market share of c.25%  notably through new contracts with Ampeco and EnerCharge. Many contracts were also signed for both in-store and online such as Luxair  IWG  Nort consulting  and Cdiscount.Financial ServicesQ2 2024 revenue totaled € 232 million  down -1.5% versus Q3 2023. The performance was primarily impacted by the earlier-than-budgeted re-insourcing of certain contracts  which was not offset by the solid Issuing processing performance. By division the main highlights were the following:Card-based payment processing activities (Issuing Processing and Acquiring Processing): Good performance led by additional revenues generated by sustained momentum in Germany and good achievements in Asia Pacific.Account Payments: Activity impacted by the early re-insourcing of some volumes. Digital Banking: Slower growth due to lower project business in France and in the Netherlands.During the second quarter  Worldline signed a significant contract with Banque Raiffeisen in Luxembourg  Worldline’s first client on its cloud-based instant payments solution. Using Worldline’s modern cloud infrastructure thanks to Google partnership  Worldline will provide the bank with the means to send and receive instant payments as mandated by the EU’s Instant Payments Regulation. Financial Services also signed several other contracts such as Sonet  Market Pay  A-Tono or partnerships with Riskquest.Mobility & e-Transactional ServicesRevenue in Mobility & e-Transactional Services reached € 89 million  up +1.3%  supported by positive business trends in France and Germany. The performance by division was the following:Trusted Services: Strong growth driven by good momentum in France  thanks to our Digital Workplace solution  and in Germany through new projects in e-health.Transport & Mobility: Performance impacted by lower volumes. Omnichannel interactions: Performance is still impacted by project delivery delays in France and Spain.In terms of commercial activity  Worldline secured a contract renewal with PMU thanks to our Worldline secure safe solution. This solution offers secure services to online gaming operators operating in France and a collection platform within a CSPN-qualified safe to comply with the French regulatory framework.Worldline also continued to expand our presence by signing a contract renewal with a major Leader in ticketing for shows and sporting events providing our integrated ticketing and payment solution. Finally  we signed an agreement with a major energy company to renew the maintenance and evolution contract for its payment and loyalty applications.H1 2024 performance per Global Business LineRevenue Adjusted EBITDA Adjusted EBITDA % In € million H12024 H12023* Organic change H12024 H12023* Organic change H12024 H12023* Organic change Merchant Services 1 658 1 606 +3.2% 386 400 -3.4% 23.3% 24.9% (161) bps Financial Services 457 464 -1.5% 126 125 +1.2% 27.7% 26.9% +74 bps Mobility & e-Transactional Services 174 172 +1.0% 30 24 +25.6% 17.1% 13.7% +334 bps Corporate (28) (30) -5.3% -1.2% -1.3% +10 bps Worldline 2 289 2 242 +2.1% 514 518 -0.9% 22.5% 23.1% (67) bps* at constant scope and exchange ratesMerchant Services revenue in H1 2024 reached € 1 658 million  representing 3.2% in organic growth.

Adjusted EBITDA margin was up 334 basis points compared to last year  driven by substantial improvement in workforce management and a strong rationalization of our infrastructure costs.Corporate costs amounted to € 28 million in H1 2024  representing 1.2% of total Group revenue compared to € 30 million in H1 2023  benefitting from the implementation of continued cost controls in support functions.2024 financing policy:On July 4th  2024  Worldline signed a €1.125bn RCF maturing in July 2029. The RCF includes two one-year extension options at the lenders’ discretion.The RCF replaces and upsizes the existing €450m and €600m Revolving Credit Facilities maturing in December 2025. It is supported by a pool of 17 international banks including new lenders.This transaction is part of Worldline’s global financing strategy to actively manage its debt maturity profile and further strengthen its financial liquidity. Worldline is rated BBB- by Standard & Poor’s and is committed to maintaining its Investment Grade Rating.FY’24 revenue guidance adapted while maintaining FCFAfter a positive momentum in MSV development in Q1’24  the Group has observed a softer macroeconomic and consumption environment in Q2’24 with a progressive slowdown of the MSV growth across all the geographies in Europe. Many large consumers-driven companies (Large retail  food & beverage  HPC  airlines  etc) experienced a similar slowdown in Q2’24 and remain cautious in their H2’24 expectations. After a low point in June  July started to show a recovery in transaction volumes versus the second quarter.In this uncertain context  we adjust our FY’24 objectives based on the latest macroeconomic developments (most notably consumption) as follows:An organic growth of c.2% to c.3%An adjusted EBITDA of c.€1.13bn to c.€1.17bnFree cash flow at c.€230m€The low range of FY’24 guidance implies that macro and European domestic consumption will stay muted in H2’24 as seen in H1’24  resulting in a assumed MSV growth in the low to mid-single digits in H2’24. This will imply an underlying growth for Merchant Services of c.6% in H2’24.The high range of FY’24 guidance implies an improvement in macro and European domestic consumption in the second half of the year  resulting in a assumed MSV growth in the mid to high-single digits in H2’24. This will imply an underlying growth for Merchant Services at 7% or above in H2’24.Assumptions remain unchanged for:Financial Services is projected to experience slightly negative growth in the second half with lower volumes on existing contracts and some re-insourcing partially offset by improving commercial dynamics.Mobility & e-Transactional Services’ growth is expected to improve throughout 2024.Mid-term ambition intact  supported by our strategic initiativesFinally  our mid-term outlook remains unchanged  supported by our strategic initiatives expected to materialize as early as 2025  notably the full benefits of Power24  new growth initiatives and the continued reduction of restructuring and integration cash costs. With this  the Group confirms the following ambition for the medium term:Mid to high-single digit revenue organic growthContinuous Adjusted EBITDA improvementFCF conversion in fast progression towards c.50%Successful ramp-up of growth enginesAs announced in Q1’24  the launch of Crédit Agricole and Worldline joint-venture is fully on track. Crédit Agricole and Worldline received unconditional authorization from the European Commission  and the management has been appointed. Laurent Bennet  Chief Executive Officer of Crédit Agricole de Savoie  was elected Chairman of the Board of Directors of the joint venture  and Meriem Echcherfi was appointed Chief Executive Officer.CAWL is expected to become fully operational and start generating sales and gross operating income during the first half of 2025  becoming a significant player in payment services in France.The first semester of 2024 was also a successful period in terms of new partnerships signed  and products launched. Among others:Cross-border online: Strategic partnership with Lidio  one of Türkiye’s leading Fintech companies  to offer direct access to local payment means  such as Troy cards  through the domestic corridor.Strategic partnership with Lidio  one of Türkiye’s leading Fintech companies  to offer direct access to local payment means  such as Troy cards  through the domestic corridor.

Regarding Financial Services  Worldline onboarded a bank on its new cloud-based instant payments solution leveraging the strategic partnership signed with Google.: Worldline partnered with Visa to launch a virtual card issuing solution for Online Travel Agencies and onboarded with already visible volumes. Regarding Financial Services  Worldline onboarded a bank on its new cloud-based instant payments solution leveraging the strategic partnership signed with Google. On the new channels : Worldline’s combined payment solution for marketplaces and platforms with OPP is now live with 165 partners. Lastly  illustrating the relevance of our SoftPos solution  more than 6 300 micro-merchants are now onboarded with continuous dynamic.In parallel  Worldline continued its geographic expansion during the first half of the year  particularly in Italy. The CCB partnership signed in Q1’24 is a strategic partnership that will bring an additional MSV of circa € 6 billion and circa 60 000 new merchants that will start to migrate on the Worldline platform during the second semester. Worldline's presence as a key regional player in the issuing and acquiring processing market also expanded further through the Financial Services division with new contracts signed with BKN30  Market Pay and A-Tono.Enhanced cost and transformation focusDuring the first semester of 2024  management put a strong focus on Power 24 execution in which key milestones were achieved:Works Council process terminatedSocial negotiations completedNew operating model designed is now live from August 2024Based on these achievements and supported by a strong mobilization across the entire organisation  we now expect to deliver circa € 220 million run-rate cash cost savings in 2025  a 10% increase versus our initial assumption.In the face of the softening environment  management is fully focused on protecting its free cash flow ambition through additional cash actions implemented since Q2’24  in particular on rationalization and integration costs  capex and working capital discipline.New governance in placeOn June 13  Worldline hosted its Shareholders’ General Meeting chaired by Mr. Georges Pauget  Interim Chairman of the Board of Directors.

This transformation is still in its infancy  but the efficacy of this change is evidenced by the doubling of Atari’s top line revenue this year. With the successful acquisition and integration of Nightdive and Digital Eclipse  and the relaunch of the Infogrames publishing label  we continue to put in place the necessary levers for long term success.”HIGHLIGHTS OF THE PERIODDuring the year  the Company focused its resources on the transformation of its operations as well as the execution of its organic growth strategy:Games - Atari continued to develop premium games based on the intellectual property acquired or owned by Atari. Atari released 11 new games including Mr. Run and Jump  Quantum Recharged  Days of Doom  Pixel Ripped 1978  Qomp2  Rollercoaster Tycoon Adventures: Deluxe  Haunted House and Berzerk Recharged. In addition  Nightdive Studios launched System Shock  Rise of the Triad: Ludicrous Edition  Star Wars Dark Forces  and Turok 3 in the second half of the year  and Digital Eclipse released The Making of Karateka  and the Early Access release of Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord.Hardware - Following the reorganization of Hardware operations completed in FY23  the focus of the year has been on the execution of the Atari 2600+ launch and commercialization campaign  which began with pre-orders in August 2023 and deliveries starting in November 2023. Since then  the Atari “+” product line has expanded to include more than 10 different hardware products. Consistent with its innovative retro-hardware strategy  the Atari 400 Mini was also launched  in collaboration with Retro Games LTD  at the end of the fiscal year. Atari also concluded a strategic partnership with Playmaji  the company behind the Polymega® game console  to collaborate on innovative retro hardware and software initiatives  alongside an investment in Playmaji.Licensing - Continued efforts on building new licensing verticals and driving of new initiatives across new categories and geographies with well respected international brands. This includes the successful launch of the MyArcade GamestationPro with licensing partner Dreamgear and the launch of an eCommerce initiative for RollerCoaster Tycoon.Atari X (formerly Web3) - With the general blockchain environment remaining challenged  Atari X has expanded from a Web3 only focus towards a larger community led initiative including cross-collaborations with other Atari lines of businesses and select partners  exclusive merchandise drops  and the launch of Atari Club. In this context  Atari also announced that it had terminated its previously announced new token project and provided a claim of a fixed number of third-party tokens to certain eligible ATRI holders  which ended September 2023.Other General Corporate DevelopmentsInvestment in tinyBuild - Atari entered into an agreement with tinyBuild  Inc. to invest US$2M as part of tinyBuild’s capital increase announced on December 21  2023. tinyBuild (AIM: TBLD) has completed its US$12M capital increase by means of the issue of new common shares on January 30  2024. Upon completion  and based on the results of the global subscription  Atari holds 7.9% of tinyBuild share capital.Purchase of RCT 3 - Atari purchased the publishing rights for Rollercoaster Tycoon 3 from Frontier Developments Plc. Atari is now the sole publisher of all major titles within the Rollercoaster Tycoon franchise. Atari manages the Rollercoaster Tycoon franchise under a long-term licensing agreement with the franchise’s creator Chris Sawyer. The purchase price of Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 franchise consists of an initial consideration of US$4M as well as potential deferred cash consideration of US$3M.ATRI Token - In July 2023 Atari stated that it was unable to create a new token given the current regulatory and commercial environment  as well as Atari’s own strategic priorities. Instead  Atari provided a mechanism for eligible token holders to receive a fixed number of third-party tokens. This was a voluntary action implemented by Atari towards its community who legitimately purchased ATRI tokens from the former joint venture  which was completed in September 2023.Brand and e-commerce - The importance of Atari.com as an e-commerce platform has continued to be developed through foundational work in scalable e-commerce operations  reviewing homepage and product pages  onboarding new licensees into the Atari.com store  and specific marketing efforts to support the holiday season and the Atari 2600+ launch campaign.Financing - Atari has successfully completed the offering of senior unsecured bonds convertible into new ordinary shares on July 31  2026  for a nominal amount of €30M (€16.3M subscribed by debt set-off and €12.9M in cash). In addition  during the year  a total of €9.8M loans with Irata LLC have been concluded to fund operations and games acquisitions.Acquisitions - Several acquisitions have been completed over the course of the year which aimed at i) increasing Atari publishing and development capabilities in retro-gaming (Nightdive Studios and Digital Eclipse): ii) further complementing Atari’s portfolio of intellectual property and games (e.g. GTI catalog of retro games  M Network Atari 2600 titles  Totally Reliable Delivery Service  publishing rights of Rollercoaster Tycoon 3)  and; iii) expanding the Atari community ecosystem with the acquisition of AtariAge.BREAKDOWN OF REVENUES BY LINES OF BUSINESS(M€) FY24 FY23 Games 14.4 7.2 Hardware 4.2 0.7 Licensing 1.8 1.3 Atari X 0.2 0.9 Total Revenue 20.6 10.1Revenues - For the full year ending March 31  2024  the Group recorded revenue of €20.6M  compared to €10.1M for the same period last year.

Investors and stakeholders will be watching closely as the company aims to hit the €1 billion mark in annual sales.Full transcript - None (MLXSF) Q2 2024:Operator: Hello  and welcome to the Melexis Q2 2024 Results Call. My name is Saska  and I will be your coordinator for today’s event. Today’s call is being recorded and for the duration your lines will be on listen-only. However  you will have the opportunity to ask questions at the end. [Operator Instructions] I will now hand you over to Marc Biron  CEO  to begin today’s conference. Please go ahead.Marc Biron: Thank you for the introduction. Dear audience  thank you for joining the Melexis second quarter 2024 earnings call. We will review our performance over the past quarter and over the first half of this year. In Q2  our sales reached €245.7 million  which is close to the higher end of our guidance. It represents a 4% increase year-over-year compared to the market [indiscernible]. Our automotive growth was mainly driven by applications outside the powertrain. We experienced new premium application that rapidly rippled down into smaller vehicles. For example  comfort features like ambient lighting or advanced climate control  in which we are a successful player  are becoming more and more widespread in the different car segments. We are also hearing from our customers about a renewed focus to develop the next platform of combustion and hybrid engine cars. Melexis is well prepared for this shift since our product portfolio covers all type of powertrain. The diversity in our portfolio makes us resilient against recent fluctuation in global car demand. In the second quarter of 2024  Melexis has introduced several innovations. We launched a new magnetic position sensor for applications requiring high functional safety level. We have expanded our LIN RGB family  and we have provided a court-free fund driver mainly used in data server. These successes highlight our growth ambition in e-steering technology  ambient lighting solutions and market beyond the automotive sector. The growth of our pipe of opportunities confirm the effectiveness of our product strategy. It is some insight of our five major design wins in Q2. One design win is a driver to actuate valves in the thermal management system of an EV in China. Another design win is also a driver  but it is used in water pump in Europe. We have booked new business with current sensor for inverter application in the U.S. and also with magnetic sensor to sense the position in the combustion engine in Korea. We have also won additional ambient lighting application in Europe. Those five examples show that we are succeeding globally  whether it is in EV or in combustion engine  in powertrain and also in non-powertrain applications. Now I will hand it over to our CFO  Karen van Griensven  who will share some financial insights.Karen van Griensven: Thank you  Marc. So hello  everybody. I will go a bit deeper into the financial results for the second quarter. So Marc already mentioned  we had €245.7 million sales in the second quarter  which is 4% more versus the same quarter a year ago and 2% more than the previous quarter. And the euro-U.S. dollar had no effect  neither versus a year ago or versus the previous quarter. The growth result was €108.8 million or 44.3% of sales  which is a decrease of 2% compared to the same quarter of last year and an increase of 2% compared to the previous quarter. R&D expenses were 10.8% of sales. G&A was at 5.3% of sales  and selling was at 2% of sales. The operating result was €64.4 million or 26.2% of sales  a decrease of 5% compared to the same quarter of last year and an increase of 1% compared to the previous quarter. The net result was €49.1 million or €1.21 per share  a decrease of 5% compared to the €51.9 million or €1.28 per share in the second quarter of 2023 and a decrease of 7% compared to the previous quarter. Our Board of Directors also decided on an interim dividend of €1.3  which will be payable after 17th of October. And related to our outlook  Melexis expects sales in the third quarter of 2024 to be in the range of €247 million to €252 million. And for the full year  Melexis expects sales to be around €1 billion with a gross profit margin above 44% and an operating margin above 25%  all taking into account a euro-U.S. dollar exchange rate of 1.08 for the remainder of the year. For the full year 2024  Melexis expects CapEx to be around €50 million  which at €60 million. So previously  we mentioned here €70 million  so a reduction of €10 million. So operator  I would now like to open the Q&A session. So please go ahead.Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And first  we have Francois Bouvignies from UBS. Please go ahead.Francois Bouvignies: Thank you very much. So my question would be on this – on your full year guidance of €1 billion. So if we look at what it is implying for Q4  it’s implying revenues up around 5% quarter-on-quarter in Q4  up 7% year-over-year in Q4 at constant currency. And it’s existing there for an acceleration and a fairly strong growth  especially when you compare to peers. So my question is really like what is driving this growth here? Can you share anything that you see  because it seems to be at odds versus the peers?Marc Biron: Yes. Our full year guidance is indeed our best estimate today based on the order book  the dynamic of the order that we see  also the new product launch that we will have towards the end of the year. Yes  I acknowledge that versus the peers  it’s the highest growth. But on the other hand  yes  during the first half of the year  we have also been a bit better than the peers.Francois Bouvignies: Okay. And maybe a quick follow-up if I may. I mean  it’s – if you look at your full year guide implying this 4%  I mean  you don’t have a lot of peers that have seen growth for auto this year. I mean  even some with strong content stories on reported NXP (NASDAQ: ) report TI [ph]  I mean  they are all down for this year for auto  some in the high single to double-digit percentage. So this plus 4%  it would be remarkable. I mean  it is already remarkable  what you are doing in H1. Can you help us understand the difference? I mean  or maybe how are you sure it’s not really stocking  like inventory buildup? Because it seems like a very big outperformance. And I really struggle to understand why Melexis would have such bigger market share gain in content wise versus all the players that I mentioned.Marc Biron: Yes  it’s indeed remarkable and we can be proud of it. To answer your question  we have a portfolio  which is quite insensitive to the type of car  which is produced or which is ordered. As I mentioned in the past  we have the similar number of IC in EV powertrain or in a ICE powertrain. Then for Melexis  we are quite insensitive to the choice of car. And we have also – we see also increase of business for what we call comfort and safety  which is outside the powertrain. And we see that this segment is increasing  yes  thanks to the premiumization of the car  I would say.Francois Bouvignies: Got it. I will go back to the queue then. Thank you.Operator: Thank you. And up next  we have Sandeep Deshpande from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.Sandeep Deshpande: Yes  hi. Just actually following up on that. Maybe can you comment on how you’ve seen the order trajectory through Q1 and Q2 and whether the orders have continued to improve through the first half of the year [indiscernible]? And then secondly  what do you have in terms of understanding of inventory held by your customers to buy our end customers itself  whether there is any risk that your customers themselves may be holding inventory of products at this point? Thanks.Marc Biron: Yes  for your first question  the 2025  I think it’s too early to discuss. We are now focused on 2024  and we will not discuss about 2025. And in terms of inventory at our customer  I think we can confirm that the peak is behind us. Now to state when the strong pickup will happen  I think it’s difficult to say.Sandeep Deshpande: Yes  my first question was not regarding 2025. My question was on how your order intake in the first half of 2024 has gone. Has it been linear through the first half? That was the question.Marc Biron: Yes  I think it has been linear. We see that versus last year  the orders are coming later. It’s clear that during the previous years that the customer were afraid to not receive their part and they were ordering very early in the process. And now I would say  the dynamic is back to what we knew before the chip crisis and before 2020. The pattern are quite similar to what we knew from the past.Sandeep Deshpande: Thank you.Operator: Thank you. And up next  we have Ruben Devos from Kepler Cheuvreux. Please go ahead.Ruben Devos: Yes. I’ll keep it at one question. Just if you could update us on the achieved design wins year-to-date  so both in automotive as in the adjacent markets and how that compares to the prior two years  which I believe were already quite successful. Yes  if you could quantify this in some way  that would be very helpful. Thank you.Marc Biron: Yes. That long term our objective is to have 20% beyond automotive  80% automotive  and this is reflected in the design win. Today  we have roughly  let’s say  10% beyond automotive  but we have more design win. The design win beyond automotive is more securing  let’s say  the future of 20%. Then we plan to – yes  we have this aspect on the design win for the adjacent. And the overall design win level  yes  we think we are on good track to reach the target at the end of this year. And there is nothing abnormal  let’s say  on the design win. As I mentioned in the introduction  it’s important to see that the design win portfolio  let’s say  is quite healthy. It’s – and for EV and for non-EV and for comfort and safety application and powertrain and non-powertrain  and I would say  for a geographical aspect  it’s also widespread.Ruben Devos: Okay. Thanks. And for these applications in the premium segment that are penetrating smaller vehicles  what are some of the key drivers? Or what’s the key appetite there leading that trend?Marc Biron: Yes. For us  we see this trend clearly for the ambient lighting  for the LIN RGB  and also for the drivers that are used in the climate control  as an example  but also in the seat comfort. Those are three examples where we see that those comfort feature are going down in a smaller type of car.Ruben Devos: All right. Thank you.Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We're now moving on to a question from Janardan Menon from Jefferies. Please go ahead.Janardan Menon: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Just going back to your sales growth  which is looking more resilient than your peers. When I specifically look at some of your direct competitors like Allegro  they are seeing a significant or broadly  their trends are significantly falling this year versus yours  which is flat to slightly up. And we don't know exactly how if Infineon (OTC: )'s magnetic sensor sales are doing within their overall automotive portfolio  but it's possible that you would be outgrowing them as well in that specific area. So do you have evidence of – a clear evidence of share gains where you are actually taking design wins at specific customers versus your competition that happen  say  in the last few years and then that is coming into your revenue stream right now? And also  just as – associated with that  is it that you are seeing a lot of growth in any geography like China where some of these ambient lighting features are being deployed in a lot of cars by the Chinese OEMs  et cetera  and you have a stronger position there versus some of your competitors who might be stronger in the U.S. or Europe or something like that? Is there any sort of geographical situation which is causing your strength versus others?Marc Biron: I would say it's difficult to answer your question or to quantify this in such short-term. As I mentioned  our design win are going well  are going as expected  I would say. The type of opportunities are growing also as expected. Yes  on the geographical aspect  I would say that  yes  we are well – we cover the different geography. Yes  China  perhaps the – your underlying question was that China; I think the design win in China are going also well. And it's a good geography spread  I would say. It's a good type of engine spread  and it's a good overall application spread between powertrain-related and non-powertrain-related. It's difficult to answer your very concrete question.Janardan Menon: Got it. But are you seeing more strength? Is your China growth higher than your non-China growth today?Marc Biron: No  it's growing in the same order of magnitude.Janardan Menon: Understood. Thank you.Operator: Thank you. And we now move on to our next question now from Veikkopekka  ING.Marc Biron: Yes  we don't hear the question.Operator: Okay. Apologies. And we are now moving on to our next question from Veikkopekka Silvasti from ING. Please go ahead.Veikkopekka Silvasti: Hello. Good morning. Can you hear me?Karen van Griensven: Yes.Veikkopekka Silvasti: Good. So it's Veikko Silvasti from ING on behalf of Marc Hesselink. I have one question regarding pricing discussions that normally start over the summer for the next year. So what kind of pricing discussions do you expect this time around? Is there more deflation in the pricing than usual or it's going to be quite similar as in previous years? Thank you.Marc Biron: As you mentioned  indeed we start the price discussion usually after summer. Then we did not start yet. Yes  what we anticipate is that  yes  it will be the regular price discussion as we knew them from – before the crisis. And we plan to handle them in the same way  I would say  that we are back to normal.Veikkopekka Silvasti: Okay. Thank you.Operator: Thank you. And we're now taking a question from Robert Sanders from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.Robert Sanders: Yes. Hi there. I just wanted to pick up on that last point about the pricing. So some of the auto suppliers seemed to be pointing at a contract and saying  price is not up for negotiation  but volume  we are open to negotiation. But I think that the general expectation in the industry were going to go back to sort of mid-single-digit price declines next year. So at what point do you have to start renegotiating the pricing into next year? Is that going to be a pricing discussion happening starting September  October for next year? Or is there a large part of next year's revenue that is kind of under contract?Marc Biron: No. We will indeed start the discussion after summer  September  October  as you mentioned. You mean that we have some LTA with our customers? Yes  which is  I think  a good basis for the discussion. Yes  but we have also customer without LTA where we need to handle the discussion as we did it in the past  I would say.Robert Sanders: Do you have a ratio between customers under LTA and customers not under LTA for next year's sales?Marc Biron: Yes  it's between 40% and 50% with LTA.Robert Sanders: Got it. And is it fair to say that the China EV  U.S. EV  major EV customer is the one – are the types of customers that don't sign LTAs  whereas the sort of traditional old-school OEMs are other ones under LTA? Or is that not a fair kind of characterization?Marc Biron: I would say the customer with LTA are more the traditional customer.Robert Sanders: Got it. Thanks. And just last question would be related to the inventory days. I don't know if this was addressed earlier. Sorry if this is a repeat question  but what is your target level of inventory  given that the inventory currently is basically six months? It doesn't feel like the historical level  which was typically less than four months. So I'm just interested to understand where you think that's going to settle down. If we go back to normal industry conditions  does that mean that there's a sort of big cash inflow next year from running down inventory? Thanks.Marc Biron: Yes. Today  let's say  we use our inventory to level out our production because  yes  we want also to be ready when the strong demand will come back. Then we want to be ready to be able – to be ready to be flexible in order to be able to deliver to our customers. And this is the way we see our inventory. Today  as I mentioned at the beginning  the – I would say  the customers are a bit short-term focused  and we want to be ready with the available product to deliver when the need is there  and some more on anticipation for you.Robert Sanders: Got it. Thanks so much.Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we're moving on to a question from [indiscernible]. Please go ahead. Your line is now open.Unidentified Analyst: Hi. Good morning. My question is on CapEx. I was wondering if you could elaborate a bit on the adjustment of the CapEx guidance? Thank you.Karen van Griensven: Yes  we indeed reduced it a little bit. It is more a timing effect of some investments that will be moved into early next year.Unidentified Analyst: Okay.Operator: Thank you. And our next question now comes from Trion Reid from Berenberg. Please go ahead.Trion Reid: Hi  there  yes. Thank you. I just wanted to follow up on that CapEx question regarding what does that imply for next year. Does it mean that actually CapEx will be more like a flat number next year? I think before  you expected that to be down. And then this is the main question I wanted to ask is just on Sensata  which I think still a big customer of yours. They recently guided to a sequential revenue decline in Q3 and mentioned the exit from some underperforming products. I just wondered if that had any impact on you  maybe not yet  but potentially in the future? Thank you.Karen van Griensven: Yes. On the CapEx for next year  it's really too early because it depends a lot on the product mix. It's too early to comment on what to expect in CapEx for next year. And yes  on the other...Marc Biron: Yes. On the Sensata  yes  there is no – we did not receive any information from Sensata about any impact. Yes  we are still working according to the LTA that we have.Trion Reid: Perfect. Okay. Thank you.Operator: Thank you. And we take a follow-up question from Janardan Menon from Jefferies. Please go ahead.Janardan Menon: Hi. Thanks. Just want to follow up. I just want to ask about the non-automotive side. The non-automotive percentage is staying roughly flattish. Are you seeing any signs of improvement in that market after the weakness last year? And would you expect into the second half of the year the non-automotive to outperform automotive? And also perhaps  you could give us an update on the progress in digital health. How are you seeing that in terms of approvals and things that are coming through?Marc Biron: Yes. In terms of the non-automotive  yes  we are investing in those markets. On emerging markets  you know that we have selected some emerging markets beyond automotive. And we are investing in our development bandwidth. We focus mainly on robotic  on two-wheelers and also on wearable. On robotic  we have this sense of touch  what we call the Tactaxis  which is a sense of touch sensor. But on top of that  we are working also on some specific position sensor that will be used in the joint of the robot. We cannot use a position sensor from automotive in the joint of the robot. We need more resolution as we develop a specific product. We developed also a torque sensor that will be used in this robot. And all the goal is to improve the accuracy of the movement of the robot. For the two-wheelers  we are also quite successful with current sensors. We are winning some business in the two-wheelers for the current sensors. For the health sector that you mentioned for the – we have also more and more traction on application outside the watch. You know that we have an important design win or an important production for a watch. But outside the watch  we see more and more traction for the digital health and for the sense of touch sensor.Janardan Menon: And just into the second half of the year  are you seeing any improvement in the non-automotive side in terms of just end demand in the short-term from customers?Marc Biron: Traditionally  let's say  Q2 and Q3 are quite strong for the digital health. It's linked to the dynamic or not the dynamic  to the timing of the market with the release of the wearable. Then  yes  Q3 will be also probably strong for the digital health.Janardan Menon: Understood. Thanks.Operator: Thank you. And as there are currently no further questions in the queue  I'd like to hand the call back over to you  Mr. Biron  for any additional or closing remarks.Marc Biron: Thank you. Yes  thank you for all the questions. I hope we have answered all of them as clear as possible. And I'm looking forward to see you or to discuss with you at the end of October  I think  the 30th of October  the next call for the future release. And for the ones that have not been on holiday yet  I hope you will be able to relax and enjoy the month of August. Thank you.Operator: Thank you for joining today's call. Ladies and gentlemen  you may now disconnect.This article was generated with the support of AI and reviewed by an editor.

Adjusted 2 organic growth amounted to +15.4% in H1’24 .. Strong growth in France (+17.9%)  Europe excl. France & Germany (+24.7%) and Americas (+21.8%)  and softer growth in Asia/Oceana/Africa (+3.7%)  which was affected by soft ad-supported revenues and FX (although the long-term tailwinds in Asia remain compelling). Germany (which continues to be actively managed away from physical distribution contracts and towards digital distribution) still penalizing revenue growth  which would have amounted to +16.4% excluding the country.Digital sales grew at a slower pace in Q2’24 on an organic basis compared with Q1’24  reflecting softer market growth and more limited market share gains.Strong increase in Adjusted EBITDA at €31.3 million  up + 29.3% versus H1’23 or a margin of 6.6%  up +80bps YoY reflecting focus on value optimization  control on investments and operating leverage.Increase in advances paid to labels and artists was less prominent than in H1'23  leading to improved free cash flow dynamic (negative €19.4 million in H1’24 compared with negative of €32.9 million in H1’23). Net cash at the end of June’24 was €183.6million.H1 2024 HighlightsCompletion of the simplified tender offer initiated by Upbeat Bidco (consortium composed of funds managed by TCV  EQT X and Denis Ladegaillerie) which now holds 96.02% of the share capital and 94.87% of the voting rights.Successful focus on key music genres with a confirmed leadership in rap music and recent developments in electronic and dance music  notably with the strategic partnership with Romanian-based Global Records.Continued investment in Asia to expand presence across multiple local markets and address strategic local music genres in the region.Further build-up of the best offer for self-releasing artists through the offering of top-notch marketing programs and self-served publishing services.2024 OutlookAdjusted EBITDA margin was ahead of expectations in H1’24 reflecting controlled investments  successful efficiency plans and focus on value optimization. The Group will pursue this strategy in H2’24 and is now expecting an Adjusted EBITDA margin higher than 6.5% (versus c. 6.5% initially anticipated).Believe also confirms a slightly positive free cash flow in FY’24.Organic growth was in line with expectations in Q1’24 but did not accelerate in Q2’24 as rapidly as anticipated. In addition  Believe is now expecting the positive effect of Q4’23 price increases at large DSPs to fade away in H2’24  when comparing year on year revenue growth.As a result  Believe reviewed its growth scenario for H2’24 and retained a conservative approach. Paid streaming increase continues to be very resilient  but will not be uplifted by significant price increases in the second half of the year. Ad-funded streaming growth is assumed to remain stable in H2’24 versus H1’24. While Believe expects to continue to gain market share in H2’24  it is unlikely to be able to fully mitigate the effect of the slightly softer than expected market growth outlook in H2’24 (driven by weaker ad-funded and no additional DSP price increases). Currency headwinds embedded in the market are still expected to be down c. -2% year-over-year. Based on those assumptions  Believe now expects organic growth of c. +12 (versus c. +18% initially). Adjusted organic growth for embedded market FX of c. + 14% (versus c. +20% initially).Denis Ladegaillerie  Founder and CEO said: “Despite persistent market headwinds in some of our key territories  Believe continued to generate solid profitable growth during the semester. We pursued our strategic roadmap to build the best artist development company in the music industry  while finalizing the restructuring of our capital structure providing us with greater financial flexibility and partners who can accelerate our profitable growth story. Believe is in good stead for the next phase of growth and industry consolidation.”H1 2024 KEY FIGURESin €million H1 2023 H1 2024 ChangeYoY Organic change Group Revenues 415.4 474.1 + 14.1% + 12.3% Premium Solutions 388.5 440.9 + 13.5% + 11.7% Automated Solutions 26.9 33.2 + 23.4% + 20.5% Adjusted EBITDA pre-Central Platform 61.7 73.4 +18.9% in % of revenues 14.9% 15.5% 60bps Premium Solutions 57.2 65.2 +14.0% Automated Solutions 4.5 8.2 +81.8% Central Platform (37.5) (42.1) +12.2% Group's Adjusted EBITDA 24.2 31.3 +29.3% in % of revenues 5.8% 6.6% 80bps Operating income / loss (EBIT) 1.0 (7.0) Net cash from operating activities (27.2) (13.1) Free cash flow (32.9) (19.4) Net cash and cash equivalents 210.2 183.6H1 2024 HIGHLIGHTSThe simplified public tender offer initiated by Upbeat Bidco  the consortium formed by funds managed by TCV  EQT X and Denis Ladegaillerie was completed on June 21. At the time of this release  the consortium holds 96.02% of the share capital. With a free float just below 4% and ongoing coverage cessation  the Group has decided to review its financial communication agenda. Going forward  Believe will publish interim and full year results  and no longer release quarterly revenues.Adjusted organic revenue growth of +15.4% in H1’24  a solid performance despite growth not accelerating as expected at the end of the semesterAfter a solid start to the year  revenue growth did not accelerate at the end of H1’24 as previously anticipated. The market growth was softer in Q2’24 than in Q1’24 and remained penalized by negative embedded market FX notwithstanding a slight improvement during the quarter.Paid streaming trends were solid and still enhanced by price increases by several large digital platforms in Q4’23. Ad-funded streaming monetization remained weak  notably in Asia. The expected recovery at the end of Q2’24 did not happen  leading the Group to a more cautious view on ad-funded streaming for the rest of the year.In H1'24  revenues grew by +14.1% to reach €474.1 million  reflecting an organic growth of +12.3%  a positive perimeter effect related to the Sentric acquisition in March’23 (€10 million in revenue recorded in Q1’24 or 2.4% to revenue growth in H1’24) and a negative forex impact (-0.6%). Revenue remained affected by embedded currency headwinds in H1’24 as the Group anticipated (-3.1%)  but the negative effect decelerated in Q2 versus Q1. Adjusted organic growth reached +15.4%.A solid performance of the roster in a wider variety of genresBelieve further grew its revenues in H1’24 reflecting a solid performance of the existing roster of artists and labels. Over the course of H1’24  the Group remained at the forefront of audience development  fostering digital monetization in an ever-growing number of digital music genres.Believe once again confirmed its leadership in France in new releases and its success in sustainably developing artists in H1’24 as illustrated by the recently released SNEP data. Believe ranked #1 on Streaming Top Albums and Top Singles  for the 1st time. Its market share is particularly high on local acts  with 40% of local top singles and 30% on local top albums (physical + digital). In addition  Believe had 5 best-selling artists in the Top 10 in H1’24  proving its unique capacity to develop multiple artists in several genres at the very top of the market.With the Group’s support  several French rap artists reached new heights in Q2’24  including KeBlack  Heuss l’Enfoiré  Uzi or Carbonne among others. Believe also saw equivalent success in Brazil with G.A. and Grego  two local hip hop / trap artists. The Group also succeeded in developing several Pop artists in Europe and Asia and helped them become top charting artists  including among others the UK band Sea Girls  the Australian band Royal Otis  Harvi  NIrvair Pannu and Fahean Abdullah in India as well as several Indonesian artists with the launch of the new imprint dedicated to the Java Pop music genre. Believe also supported the development of Sevdaliza  an Iranian-Dutch electro artist which has been upsell from TuneCore to Premium Solutions  whose recent Ride or Die part 2 track entered the Spotify Daily Top 50 in 19 countries  of which 11 in top 10 position and whose track Alibi generated more than 67 million streams in two weeks.Building strong market position in digital friendly music genres: further progress in electronic and dance music with the acquisition of Global RecordsSince 2023  the Group is expanding its position in electronic and dance music with the launch of two global dance/electronic music labels  b.electronic and All Night Long. This increased Believe’s commercial appeal in those music genres and enabled the Group to develop both labels and artists digitally. Aligned with its blueprint strategy to first grow organically then implement partnerships with entrepreneurial labels to accelerate growth  Believe signed a strategic partnership with Global Records  Central and Eastern Europe’s top independent dance music company  and committed to take a 25% stake in its capital.The objective is to accelerate Global Records’ growth by bringing together Believe’s successful track record of developing digital-friendly music genres across multiple territories and unrivaled capacity to scale and grow local businesses  and Global Records’ powerful full-service model and A&R capacities in dance music. Global Records is a music first company that has built a solid reputation as a hitmaker in dance music. In 2023 only  it cumulated over 6 billion streams across all platforms and over 20 billion streams for its global catalogue.Pursuing investment in Asia to strengthen its regional footprint and foster future growth opportunities despite softer market conditions experienced across the region outside China and JapanBelieve pursued its investment in Greater China and reinforced the local top management to prepare for the next phase of growth. Now the world’s fifth music market  Greater China recorded the fastest rates of revenue growth in 2023  with a relatively low penetration of paid music subscribers. Looking ahead  the streaming market in China is expected to grow by more than 120% by 2030 (according to Midia estimates)  boosting the rise of digital-friendly music genres like hip-hop and the emergence of top-charting artists. The local top management is responsible for defining and leading the most adapted revenue growth strategies  growing the roster of local artists and labels and further building up relationships with local digital services.Believe also launched Krumulo  a new imprint in Indonesia dedicated to Java Pop  one of the most popular local genres with the objective to be the top-of-mind artist services brand for Java Pop artists. The imprint will provide an adaptive  personalized and comprehensive marketing and promotion strategy across various touchpoints and help them to expand their reach to nation-wide engagement.Further building up the best offer for self-releasing artistsAs of June’24  self-releasing artists on TuneCore earned more than $4 billion since the company’s founding in 2006  with $1 billion paid out since December’22. The automated platform was aided by the deals with DSPs negotiated by Believe  the expansion of publishing activities since Sentric’s acquisition (March’23) and the launch of the TuneCore Accelerator marketing program in December’23. The new marketing program helped artists get their music in front of more listeners and enabled TuneCore to be once again recognized as one of Fast Company’s most innovative companies. TuneCore maintained its focus on building the most complete suite of products to support the development of self-releasing artists. Under this objective  the TuneCore Mastering tool  which is designed to help artists improve the sound quality of their recordings before release  was added at the end of Q2’24.H1’24 FINANCIALSPremium Solutions and Automated Solutions both driving revenue growth in H1’24Digital Music Sales3 (DMS) amounted to €636.9million in H1’24  up +9.0% year-over-year  with Premium Solutions again recording a double-digit growth and a solid performance in Automated Solutions.In H1’24  Premium Solutions  revenues amounted to €440.9 million  up c. +13.5% at current rate  mostly reflecting an organic growth of +11.7% and a positive perimeter effect of +2.3% related to the acquisition of Sentric (completed in March’23). Adjusted organic growth was +15.1% in H1’24. Addressable markets were softer in Q2’24 versus Q1’24  resulting in lower organic growth for Believe  but this was mitigated by an improvement in the estimated embedded market FX effect (-2.7% in Q2’24 versus -4.0% in Q1’24).Paid streaming trends remained solid throughout the semester  while ad-funded streaming activities remained subdued notably in Asia and did not recover at the end of Q2’24 as initially anticipated by the Group. Believe continued gaining market share in H1’24  but they were more limited in Q2’24 compared with previous quarters.Automated Solutions revenues amounted to €33.2 million up by +23.4% in H1’24  reflecting +18.2% in Q1’24 and +28.0% in Q2’24. Digital sales showed improvement throughout the semester and recorded a solid growth acceleration in Q2’24. Non-digital sales were significantly up compared with last year  driven by the integration of Sentric self-served activities and a positive one-off in publishing activities (TuneCore was already providing publishing services before the acquisition). Automated Solutions growth was also supported by its new marketing advanced program (TuneCore Accelerator program)  which is boosting its performance notably on Spotify.Strong growth in France  the Americas and Europe excluding France and Germanyin € million H1 2023 H1 2024 Change YoY Europe excl.

France and Germany. This was completed in Q2’24 and most of revenues were reallocated to the US.Revenue growth amounted to +24.7% in Europe (excluding France and Germany) and represented 32.1% of total revenues in H1’24. Believe recorded strong growth across Eastern Europe and in Spain  while the activity remained solid in Italy. Revenues in Turkey significantly increased throughout the semester. The performance in the UK was penalized by the reallocation of Sentric revenues to the US which was done in Q2’24 and therefore hampered the comparison basis with Q2’23 as all Sentric revenues were then allocated in this market.Americas grew by +21.8% and represented 15.6% of Group revenues in H1’24. The performance in Q2’24 was uplifted by the reallocation of Sentric revenues to the US. The level of activity was strong in Mexico  while Brazil recorded a slowdown in its revenue growth. TuneCore achieved a solid level of revenues thanks to its powerhouse marketing program TuneCore Accelerator  while also recording strong growth of its publishing activities  which included a positive one-off related to the acquisition of Sentric.In France  revenues increased by +17.9% in H1’24 and represented 16.5 % of Group revenues. Digital revenues continued recording double-digit growth throughout the semester  but the growth rate stalled momentarily down in April. The Group confirmed its leadership for local acts in France notably in the rap music genre. Non-digital sales were also very dynamic  driven by live and branding activities. Given the market position and the size of Artist Services  non-digital revenues h ave become significant as Believe offers a complete range of services to the top local artists that it serves.In H1’24  revenue growth reached +3.7% in Asia Pacific and Africa  which represented 24.5% of Group revenues. After a slow start to the year (as a result of weaker ad-funded streaming market)  the Group returned to revenue growth in Q2’24. The level of activity in Greater China and Japan  where the Group is currently building up its position was strong throughout the semester. Revenues were up slightly in India and down in several Southeast Asian markets  as the two regions are more dependent on ad-funded streaming. In addition  Believe’s market position in several Southeast Asian markets mitigated its capacity to generate additional market share gains.In Germany  revenues were down -1.2% in H1’24 and represented 11.3% of Group revenues. After declining in Q1’24  revenues stabilized in Q2’24. Digital sales were slightly up in Q1’24 and further progressed in Q2’24  confirming their positive trajectory thanks to the strong positioning on local acts and the ongoing diversification of music genres in the roster. Non-digital sales continued to decline throughout the semester on the back of Believe’s proactive decision to accelerate its exit from contracts that were too heavily reliant on physical sales and merchandising  which should reset the business to a stronger base for future growth and margins.Strong increase in Adjusted EBITDA margin illustrating control on investments and operating leverageBelieve adapted its investment pace to the growth level and focused on further optimizing value  improving efficiency and deploying automation in H1’24. The Group continued investing in local teams to fuel its future revenue growth. Hence Believe reduced its pace of investment in local teams in H1’24  while launching its Be Odyssey program  which aims at further optimizing technological capabilities of the Central Platform and required increased spending dedicated to Tech and Product.Adjusted EBITDA pre-Central Platform costs4 grew by +18.9% in H1’24 to reach €73.4 million (versus €61.7 million in H1’23). Believe pursued its investment strategy in H1’24 to support its profitable growth plan. The Group deployed additional sourcing and servicing capabilities in Premium Solutions  while further rolling out its new marketing program TuneCore Accelerator and accelerating the development of self-served publishing activities. The Group was however focused on controlling its investment in local teams in H1’24. As a result  the Adjusted EBITDA margin pre-Central Platform further progressed and reached 15.5% in H1’24  an increase of 60bps compared with H1’23 (14.9%). This margin included growth investments in both segments including Sentric  which represented 3.1% of total revenues in H1’24.Central Platform costs (€42.1 million in H1’24 versus €37.5 million in H1’23) increased by +12.2% year-over-year and remained stable over revenue versus last year (8.9% in H1’24 compared with 9.0% in H1’23). Believe continued implementing efficiency plans to optimize its investments in the Central Platform and also launched in H1’24 its Be Odyssey program to prepare for the next phase of growth and scale increase. As a result  Tech & Product costs significantly increased in H1’24. Sales & Marketing costs progressed more in line with revenue growth  while General & Administrative spending declined for the first year since the IPO. Notwithstanding the increase in Tech & Product  Central Platform costs remained stable as a percentage of revenue.As for previous years  some Central Platform investments are capitalized under IFRS accounting principles. In H1’24  total investment (P&L and capitalized costs) in the Central Platform amounted to €48.9 million. Total investment went up +8.0% year-over-year and represented 10.3% of total Group revenues compared with 10.9% in H1’23  or a decrease of 60bps.The Group’s Adjusted EBITDA grew by +29.3% year-over-year to reach €31.3 million compared with €24.2 million in H1’23. Adjusted EBITDA margin stood at 6.6% in H1’24 compared with 5.8% in H1’23 thanks to the Adjusted EBITDA margin increase at the segment level and better operating leverage achieved in Central Platform. The Group therefore is progressing in delivering operating leverage and approaching the high-end of the mid-term objective level (Group adjusted EBITDA margin of 5% to 7% by 2025).Operating income (EBIT) reflecting higher D&A versus last year and costs related to the Offer processDepreciation & Amortization amounted to €24.8 million in H1’24  up +17.2% compared with H1’23 (€21.2 million)  reflecting the resumption of the external growth strategy since Q1’23 as it is the first driver of the past D&A increases reported by the Group. The Group recorded €7.3 million in other operating expenses largely driven by costs related to the offer initiated by the consortium. This was a steep change compared with last year as the Group recorded a positive other income of €2.0 million in H1’23. As a result  EBIT was negative €7.0 million.Free cash flow reflecting commercial dynamism. Solid cash level at the end of June’24Working capital variation was negative by €34.3 million  reflecting higher artist and label advances that grew by €25.5 million compared with the end of December’23. In H1’24  the Group had the opportunity to further deepen its relationships with its existing roster and to attract additional Tier1 labels. Signing activity was  however  hampered by the offer process and the associated unsolicited approach the Group faced. As anticipated by the Group  there were some renewals of large Tier1 labels on better and longer terms in H1’24  but this trend was not confirmed in H2’24.Free cash flow was negative by €19.4 million in H1’24 reflecting negative working capital variation. Capex amounted to €15.3 million and represented 3.2% of Group revenue  compared with €18.4 million or 4.4% of Group revenue in H1’23  and were mostly capitalized costs.Cash on the balance sheet amounted to €183.6 million at the end of June’24 compared with €210.2 million at the end of June’23 and €214.2 million at the end of December’23  mostly higher artist and label advances and capex compared with last year.The Group will continue to manage its cash and to allocate between advances and acquisitions  seeking opportunities with greater return and better contribution to the profitable growth strategy that Believe is pursuing.FY 2024 OUTLOOKIn FY’24  the Group will continue to drive a profitable growth trajectory towards its long-term profitability objective of 15% Adjusted EBITDA margin.Adjusted EBITDA margin was ahead of expectations in H1’24  thanks to continued operating leverage (controlled investments  successful efficiency plans and focus on value optimization). The Group will pursue this strategy in H2’24 and now anticipates an Adjusted EBITDA margin of at least 6.5% (versus c. 6.5% initially). Believe will further focus on value optimization in H2’24. The Group will also continue to adapt the investment cycle to market growth and to optimize investments in the Central Platform and increase efficiency through automatization.Organic growth was in line with expectations in Q1’24 but did not accelerate in Q2’24 as rapidly as anticipated. Besides  Believe is now expecting the positive effect of Q4’23 price increases of large DSPs to fade away in H2’24. As a result  Believe now retains a conservative approach for its growth scenario for H2’24. Paid streaming increase remains very resilient but will not be uplifted by significant price increases in H2’24. Ad-funded streaming growth is assumed stable in H2’24 versus H1’24. This will not be fully mitigated by the expected additional market share gains. Currency headwinds embedded in the market are still expected to be down c. -2% year-over-year. Based on those assumptions  Believe now expects organic growth of c. +12% (versus c. +18% initially). Adjusted organic growth for embedded market FX of c. + 14-16% (versus c. +20% initially).Believe also confirms it will deliver a slightly positive free cash flow in FY’24. The Group will continue to allocate cash between advances and acquisitions in the months ahead. Believe’s reinforced appeal to a greater number of artists and labels in a wider variety of music genres and the ongoing industry consolidation provide more attractive opportunities for the Group  which will therefore allocate more cash to internal and external investments going forward.The interim earnings report is available on our investor website: Financials | BelieveNext earnings release of Believe (Ticker: BLV  ISIN: FR0014003FE9):13 March 2025: FY 2024 earnings – Press release to be issued after market close.Investor Relations & Financial MediaEmilie MEGELinvestors@believe.comCell: + 33 6 07 09 98 60 Press RelationsManon JESSUAmanon.jessua@believe.comMaria DA SILVAmaria.da-silva@agenceproches.comCell: +33 7 60 70 23 16Appendix1.

For our customers  the Ayvens’ brand name that establishes our company as a leading global mobility player is now live in twenty countries. The legal integration of local entities in overlapping countries has been completed in France and the Netherlands  our flagship locations  as well as for our insurance business in Dublin. Finally  we are streamlining and optimizing our combined procurement operations  insurance activities  commerce forces and IT architecture and have already begun to reap the benefits of our integration journey.Ayvens is progressing at a high pace in its transformational journey and I am grateful to all our teams for their unwavering commitment.”MOVING FORWARD WITH LEASEPLAN INTEGRATIONSimplifying the Group’s legal structure and IT architectureAyvens is moving forward in its integration journey after the Group obtained the Declaration of No-Objection (DNO) from the European Central Bank and the Dutch National Bank in March 2024. As at today  entities have been legally integrated in four countries  including France and the Netherlands  all four accounting for c. 31% of the Group’s funded fleet. Rebranding has gained momentum  now concerning twenty entities and IT migration has been successfully executed in three countries. These are key steps in the successful building-up of Ayvens leadership in the mobility industry.Delivering on synergiesIntegration has contributed to generate EUR 27m synergies in Q2 2024  an increase of EUR +7m compared to previous quarter. These synergies reflect mostly the benefits of supply contract renegotiations and new tenders in procurement services  as well as the transfer of 455 000 insured vehicles since the beginning of the year to more profitable direct insurance schemes. With the cumulative EUR 47m synergies delivered since the beginning of the year  operational execution is on track to achieve the EUR 120m P&L pre-tax synergies targeted over the full year 2024.MANAGING ELECTRIC VEHICULES ASSET VALUE THROUGHOUT LIFE CYCLEDrawing on its advanced residual value management system built up over 23 years of experience in the industry  Ayvens has put in place a dedicated framework to manage responsibly the EV transition.

This increase was primarily driven by inflation on car prices and the transition to EVs  which have a higher value than ICE cars.Ayvens’ total fleet has remained broadly flat year-on-year at 3.373 million  -0.4% vs. end June 2023  reflecting a commercial selective approach to restore margins.Fleet management contracts decreased by -4.9% vs. June 2023  remaining broadly stable vs. March 2024  at 0.686 million vehicles as at 30 June 2024.Full-service leasing contracts reached 2.686 million vehicles as at end June 2024  up 0.8% year-on-year on a like-for-like basis  and down -0.5% vs. March 2024.EV penetration reached 39%9 of new passenger car registrations in Q2 2024 vs. 36% in Q1 2024. Ayvens’ BEV and PHEV10 penetration stood at 26% and 13% respectively in Q2 2024.Income statement11LeasePlan Purchase Price Allocation has been adjusted in Q2 2024 within one year from acquisition closing in accordance with IFRS3 “Business combinations”  leading to an impact of EUR -25 million on net assets  of which EUR -63 million relate to the reassessment of LeasePlan’s software valuation  offset by a subsequent increase of EUR +60 million in lease assets and EUR -22 million of correction of other assets and liabilities.All financial data presented and commented thereafter have been restated for the total impact of LeasePlan’s Purchase Price Allocation attributed to each quarter since acquisition closing and the adjustment of Fleetpool’s fleet depreciation costs which resulted in an accounting restatement of the comparative income statement for 2023.

The increase in net book value of the vehicles sold due to the reduction in depreciation costs booked in the previous reporting periods: EUR -68 million vs. EUR -90 million in Q1 2024.The PPA amortization at EUR -75 million stable vs. Q1 2024.Including the impact of PPA and reduction in depreciation costs from previous quarters  UCS result per unit was EUR 575 in Q2 2024 vs. EUR 573 per unit in Q1 2024 and EUR 905 per unit in Q2 2023.In H1 2024  the UCS result stood at EUR +178 million  down vs. EUR +278 million in H1 2023  driven by the normalization of used car markets.As at 30 June 2024  the Group’s stock of reduction in depreciation costs to be reversed over the coming years was EUR 462 million  of which EUR 149 million to be reversed by the end of 2024.

Excluding non-recurring items  operating expenses decreased by EUR 20 million i.e. -4.3% vs. Q1 2024.The combination of lower costs and higher underlying margins compared to Q1 2024 led to an improvement quarter-on-quarter of the Cost/Income ratio excl.

The non-IFRS financial measures presented are measures used by management to monitor the underlying performance of the business and operations and  have therefore not been audited or reviewed. Furthermore  they may not be indicative of the historical operating results  nor are they meant to be predictive of future results. These non-IFRS measures are presented because they are considered important supplementary measurements of Banijay Group N.V.'s (the ""Company"") performance  and we believe that these and similar measures are widely used in the industry in which the Company operates as a way to evaluate a company’s operating performance and liquidity. Not all companies calculate non-IFRS financial measures in the same manner or on a consistent basis. As a result  these measures and ratios may not be comparable to measures used by other companies under the same or similar names.Regulated information related to this press release is available on the website:https://group.banijay.com/results-center/https://group.banijay.com/APPENDIXGlossaryAdjusted EBITDA: for a period is defined as the operating profit for that period excluding restructuring costs and other non-core items  costs associated with the long-term incentive plan within the Group (the ""LTIP"") and employment related earn-out and option expenses  and depreciation and amortization net of reversals (excluding D&A fiction and non-recurring provisions).

This agreement  approved on June 25 by the Atos Board of Directors  was signed on June 26  2024.The rights granted to the French State will initially result from the agreement and will be supplemented by the issuance by Bull SA of a preferred share (action de preference) for the benefit of the French State.The French State will benefit from governance rights at the level of Bull SA  in particular rights of representation on corporate bodies (without voting rights at this stage) and prior authorization and approval rights (droits d’autorisation préalable et d’agrément) designed to protect sovereign sensitive activities.The agreement also provides for a right for the French State to purchase sovereign sensitive activities if a third-party has acquired 10% or a multiple of 10% of Atos’ or Bull SA’s share capital or voting rights and that the parties have not reached a reasonable agreement on how to protect national interests in relation to these sovereign sensitive activities (without prejudice to the application of the French FDI regime).The issuance of this preferred share is expected in the course of the second semester of 2024.Contemplated disposal of BDS’ Advanced Computing  Mission-Critical Systems and Cybersecurity Products businesses to the French StateOn June 14  2024  Atos SE announced that it had received a non-binding confirmatory offer letter from the French State regarding the potential acquisition of 100% of the Advanced Computing  Mission-Critical Systems and Cybersecurity Products activities of its Big Data & Cybersecurity (“BDS”) division.This non-binding confirmatory offer is for a total enterprise value of €700 million.Atos’ Board of Directors  under the aegis of the Conciliator Maître Hélène Bourbouloux  and the Company's management are discussing this proposal with the French State  noting that no assurances can be made that the parties will successfully negotiate and enter into a definitive agreement.Binding offer received from ALTEN for WorldgridOn June 11  2024  Atos announced it has entered into exclusive negotiations with ALTEN SA (“ALTEN”) for the sale of its Worldgrid business unit for a binding enterprise value of €270 million.The Group confirms that the transaction is expected to close before the end of 2024 and is subject to the consultation of the relevant employee representative bodies and other customary regulatory approvals.Liquidity  financial restructuring and continuity of operationsThe Group’s half-year interim condensed consolidated financial statements for the six months ended June 30  2024 have been prepared on a going concern basis. The Group’s cash flow forecasts for the twelve months following the approval of the 2024 half-year interim condensed consolidated financial statements by the Board of Directors result in a cash situation that meets its liquidity needs over that period.The cash forecasts  which take into account the latest business forecasts  have been prepared in particular based on the following assumptions:The interim financing of €800 million has been secured  thus providing the liquidity necessary to fund the business until the close of the financial restructuring plan;The short-term interim financing to be refinanced with the €1 750 million new money debt in an amount from €1.5 billion to €1.675 billion  as well as €75 million in the form of backstop in cash of rights issue;The proceeds from the sale of the Worldgrid business unit to ALTEN for an enterprise value of €270 million.At June 30  2024  cash  cash equivalents  and short term financial assets of the Group amounted to €881 million  including the benefits of working capital optimization at June end. Borrowings amounted to €5 098 million  of which €2 400 million of bonds and €2 600 million of bank financing. As a result  the total net debt for the Group amounted to €4 218 million at June 30  2024. In addition  the Atos SE’s leverage ratio applicable to the multi‑currency revolving credit facility and the Term Loan A amounted to 7.32x at June 30  2024.Atos SE wishes to draw attention to the maturity of Atos SE’s borrowings and the risks associated with its refinancing. The coming maturities of its borrowings are as follows:the €1.5 billion Term Loan A  which expired on July 29  2024  since the extension request shall be considered as being without effect because of the opening of the accelerated safeguard procedure on July 23  2024;the €500 million bond (Optional Exchangeable Bond) maturing in November 2024;the €750 million bond maturing in May 2025;the €900 million revolving credit facility maturing in November 2025;the €50 million NEU MTN maturing in April 2026;the €350 million bond maturing in November 2028; andthe €800 million bond (Sustainability‑Linked Bond) maturing in November 2029.It should be noted that in the context of the opening of the accelerated safeguard procedure announced on July 24  2024  a debt freeze is now in effect  prohibiting the payment of assigned receivables arising prior to the opening of the accelerated safeguard and of certain debts arising after the opening relating to assigned receivables that are not useful for the restructuring – this rule does not apply to creditors who are not affected by the accelerated safeguard procedure.As stated in its press release of February 5  2024  Atos SE has entered into discussions with its banks and bondholders with a view to reaching a global agreement on the restructuring of its financial debt. These discussions  that were held under the aegis of the CIRI (“Comité Interministériel de Restructuration Industrielle”) and the mandataire ad hoc appointed since the beginning of February 2024  continued under an amicable conciliation procedure in order to frame these discussions and facilitate the emergence of a global agreement within a short and well‑defined timetable. These discussions led to an agreement on the terms of the financial restructuring between the Company and a group of banks and bondholders  as announced on June 30  2024 by the Company  and to the conclusion of a Lock-Up Agreement with a majority of the Company’s financial creditors  as announced on July 15  2024 by the Company.In this context  on July 24  2024  the Company announced the opening of an accelerated safeguard proceedings in order to implement and obtain the approval of the Nanterre Specialized Commercial Court on the terms of the financial restructuring plan agreed in the Lock-Up Agreement. The main features of the financial restructuring plan agreed in the Lock-Up Agreement consist of €1 750 million of new funding  a debt reduction of €3.1 billion and no debt maturing before year-end 2029.The plan should be implemented through several capital increases and debt issuances from November 2024 until January 2025  as well as the provision of €800 million short-term interim financing available to the Company secured until closing and to be refinanced with the €1 750 million New Financings to be put in place before year-end 2024.Considering the interim financing  the Group has sufficient liquidity to operate business until the financial restructuring plan is implemented.As indicated in its previous communications  the Company reminds that the implementation of the contemplated financial restructuring plan will result in massive dilution for existing Atos shareholders  who should  if they do not participate in the envisaged share capital increases  hold less than 0.1% of the share capital.The implementation of the financial restructuring remains subject to the fulfilment of several conditions precedent  including in particular:Finalization and conclusion of the long form financial restructuring documentation  including the accelerated safeguard plan;Approval by the AMF of the securities notes (note d’opérations) relating to the contemplated capital increases;Receipt of a report from an independent expert confirming that the terms of the proposed financial restructuring (including in relation to the capital increases) are fair from a financial perspective in accordance with the AMF General Regulation  as customary for transactions of this nature;Judgment of the specialized Commercial Court of Nanterre (Tribunal de Commerce spécialisé de Nanterre) approving the accelerated safeguard plan implementing the definitive financial restructuring agreement; andObtaining regulatory approvals  if applicable.However there remains an uncertainty upon the ability of the Group to continue as a going concern in the event that the Group is unable to implement the envisaged financial restructuring plan. In that case  Atos SE may not be able to realize its assets or settle its liabilities within the ordinary course of its operations  and the application of IFRS accounting standards in the ordinary context of going concern  in particular with regards to the measurement of assets and liabilities  may not be appropriate.Appointment by the Board of Directors of Sorgem Evaluation as Indepent expert for the purpose of providing an opinion on the financial restructuringAs announced in the Company’s press release dated June 30  2024  the Board of Directors of the Company has appointed  on a voluntary basis pursuant to Article 261-3 of the AMF’s General Regulation  and on the proposal of the Company’s ad hoc Committee  the firm Sorgem Evaluation  represented by Mr. Maurice Nussenbaum and Mr. Florent Myara  as independent expert  for the purpose of providing an opinion on the financial restructuring. The independent expert will assess the financial conditions of the financial restructuring for shareholders and issue a report containing a fairness opinion  which will be made available to shareholders prior to the consultation of the shareholders class and in accordance with applicable legal and regulatory provisions.Operating Margin to Operating incomeIn € million H1 2024 H1 2023 Operating margin 115 212 Reorganization -60 -430 Rationalization and associated costs -5 -30 Integration and acquisition costs -2 -4 Amortization of intangible assets (PPA from acquisitions) -29 -60 Equity based compensation -3 -14 Impairment of goodwill and other non-current assets -1 570 -55 Other items -150 -53 Operating loss -1 704 -434Non recurring items were a net expense of €1 819 million.Reorganization costs amounted to €60 million  of which €34 million of restructuring measures and €26 million of costs related to the outstanding activities on the separation and transformation of the Group.Rationalization and associated costs were €5 million compared with €30 million in H1 2023  as the consolidation plan of data centers in North America reached completion at the end of 2023.Integration and acquisition costs of €2 million mainly related to the cost of retention schemes  as well as residual integration activities on past acquisitions.Amortization of intangible assets recognized in the purchase price allocation exercises amounted to €29 million and was mainly composed of Syntel customer relationships and technologies.Non-cash goodwill and other non-current assets impairment amounted to €1 570 million  mostly related to the impairment of goodwill for €1 452 million in both Eviden (Americas and Northern Europe & APAC) and Tech Foundations (Northern Europe & APAC)  and to the impairment of customer relationships for €109 million in Americas as a result of customer contract terminations.In H1 2024  Other items were a net expense of €150 million compared with €53 million in the first half 2023 and included:An additional loss on past asset disposals for €55 million;Advisors fees on the financial restructuring of the Group and on the asset disposals for €51 million;The reassessment on an onerous contract in Northern Europe that was accounted for under Other items in 2021 for €11 million.As a result  operating loss was at €-1 704 million  compared with a loss of €-433 million in H1 2023.Operating Income to Net income Group ShareIn € million H1 2024 H1 2023 Operating loss -1 704 -434 Net financial expense -175 -103 Tax charge -62 -65 Non-Controlling interests 0 0 Share of net profit of equity-accounted investments 0 2 Net loss Group Share -1 941 -600 Normalized net loss (Group share)2 -124 -113 Basic earning per share (in euros) -17.48 -5.42 Diluted earning per share (in euros) -17.48 -5.42Net financial expense was €175 million and was composed of:The net cost of financial debt of €73 million  compared with €40 million in H1 2023. This variation mainly resulted from higher interest costs on the multi-currency revolving credit facility and Term loan A for which additional portions were drawn in the second half of 2023 and in January 2024  combined with a lower interest income as a result of a lower level of deposits; andOther financial items a net loss of €102 million  compared with a net loss of €63 million in H1 2023. These costs were mainly composed of:€19 million lease liability interests; €16 million pension related financial expense; €15 million amortization charges for transaction costs directly attributable to financial debts and capitalized in prior years which were fully amortized in the first half of 2024 in the context of the current financial restructuring of the Group; €12 million of transaction costs incurred in the first half of 2024 and directly attributable to the ongoing financial restructuring of the Group; €10 million of factoring costs; €8 million of net foreign exchange loss.The tax charge for H1 2024 was €62 million.Net loss group share was €-1 941 million  mainly impacted by the goodwill and other non-current assets impairment charges of €-1 570 million.The normalized net loss Group share excluding unusual  abnormal and infrequent items (net of tax) was €-124 million  compared of €-113 million in H1 2023.

It is specified that those specific optimization did not comprise any reverse factoring measure.Cash out related to taxes paid increased by €+5 million and amounted to €45 million in the first half 2024  including € 6 million of taxes paid in connection with carve-out transactions completed in 2024.Net cost of financial debt was €73 million as explained above.The total of reorganization  rationalization & associated costs and integration & acquisition costs reached €171 million compared with €274 million in H1 2023 and included:€103 million of for reorganization costs in connection with restructuring measures as well as the continuation of the German restructuring plans;€59 million of costs related to the outstanding activities on the separation of the Group mostly over the first quarter of the year;€7m of rationalization cost resulting from the closure and consolidation of data centers  mainly in North America.Cash out related to Other changes was €-167 million compared to € -165 million in the first half of 2023  and included:€96 million of costs incurred on onerous contracts for which the provision was recorded in Other operating items at the end of December 2021 €34 million of payments for advisors fees on the financial restructuring of the Group and on the asset disposals  and€13 million of legal costs.As a result of the above impacts mainly driven by the change in the working capital requirement  the Group presented a negative Free Cash Flow of €-1 914 million in 2023  compared with €-969 million in the first half of 2023.The net cash impact resulting from net disposals amounted to €-63 million reflecting the revaluation of short-term financial asset no longer expected to be collected considering the probable price adjustment on a past disposal.No dividends were paid to Atos SE shareholders in the first half of 2024.

Technip Energies (the “Company”)  a leading Engineering & Technology company for the energy transition  today announces its unaudited financial results for the first half of 2024.Arnaud Pieton  Chief Executive Officer of Technip Energies  commented:“Technip Energies delivered a strong first half performance  which puts us well on track to achieve our full-year guidance. Our revenues grew by double digits year-over-year  driven by positive backlog evolution and strong demand for our offerings  while robust execution ensured continued margin strength. Our consistent underlying free cash flow generation and balance sheet support ongoing investments into strategic growth initiatives  our people and our assets  preparing T.EN for the future.”“We achieved significant commercial success with two major LNG project awards in the Middle East  which enhance our leadership in low-carbon  electrified plants - a strategic objective for T.EN - and evidence this industry’s clear intent to decarbonize. We also benefited from sustained strength in TPS orders  which grew by nearly 15% year-over-year  reflecting high demand across our offerings and our ability to deliver innovative and reliable solutions to our customers. This momentum in orders is reflected in a very healthy backlog position  up 8% year-to-date  and equivalent to around three years of revenue.”“The excellent visibility offered by our backlog combined with the breadth and quality of our commercial pipeline underpins our strong outlook. We continue to see natural gas playing an important role in securing a low-carbon world. This includes LNG  with high-quality opportunities  notably in East Africa  North America and the Middle East. We are also experiencing strong engagement in the decarbonized markets for blue molecules  which use gas as a feedstock  and where T.EN offers a differentiated portfolio of technologies and solutions. Combined  these markets represent a €45 billion opportunity for T.EN through 2026  for which we are well positioned.”“Beyond our commercial successes  we have made strong progress in executing our other strategic objectives to reinforce our longer-term growth outlook and open up new plays for T.EN. This includes the launch of Rely Clear100+  a productized solution for a 100 megawatt  pre-engineered green hydrogen plant  as well as launching the eMAX series - a suite of electric and automated loading arms. In addition  our technology development programs are progressing well  supported by our network of labs. We are accelerating economic solutions for green and circular polyester. This includes the commissioning of our Reju company’s state-of-the-art demonstration plant for textile-to-textile recycling.”“Finally  I would like to thank our teams for their outstanding performance and dedication in the first half of the year  I am proud of what we have achieved together  and I look forward to building on our momentum in the second half of the year and beyond.”Key financials – adjusted IFRS(In € millions  except EPS and %) H1 2024 H1 2023 Revenue 3 164.3 2 838.7 Recurring EBIT 227.3 207.7 Recurring EBIT margin % 7.2% 7.3% Net profit 188.1 125.3 Diluted earnings per share(1) €1.04 €0.70 Order intake 4 006.8 8 959.6 Backlog 16 951.7 18 892.3 Financial information is presented under adjusted IFRS (see Appendix 8.0 for complete definition).
